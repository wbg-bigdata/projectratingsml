DEBI-LLMPSAR IRRIGATION PROJECT
(Credit 7?5-SE)
MRFACE
This is the Project Completion Report (PCR) of the Debi-Lampsar
Irrigation Projoct in Senegal, for wilch Credit 775-SE, in the amount of
US$20 million was approved on March 7, 1978. The original Cridit Closing
Date wee June 30, 1983, but after s-veral extensions, the eventual Closing
Date was Octobor 29, 1986. The project was the twelfth Bank Credit In the
agricultural sector and the second for Irrigation development in Senegal.
It Is expected to be followed by the Irrigation IV Project, which as of
this writing waits Board approval.
The PCR was prepared by the West Africa Region following a mission
to Senegal from February 9 to 20, 1987, and is based on the Lampear Project
Completion Report prepared by the Implementing agency (SAED), a review of
the Staff Appraisal Report, SAR No. 1685a-SE, and the President's Report,
No. P-2192a-SE, both dated Februray 21, 1978, and the Credit Agreement of
March 17, 1978; relevant Bank files, including correspondence with the
Borrower, internal Bank memoranda, minutes of the Board's discussions, Bank
supervision reports, project progress reports prepared by the Borrower; as
well as interview with past and current officials of the Bank and in
Senegal who have been associated with the project.
The roport vas not subjected to an audit by OED, but was sent to
Government for couments on January 5, 1988; however, no comments were
received.

DEBI-LAMPSAR IRRIGATION PROJECT
(Credit 775-SE)
PROJECT COMPLETION REPORT
Evaluation Summary
Introduction
1.        This was the second irrigation project the Bank financed in
Senegal and like the first project was located in the Senegal River Delta.
At the time of project preparation, some 10.000 ha with full water control
were already in operation in the Delta, with an additional 240,000 ha
thought appropriate for development once the planned Diama and Manantali
dams were  completed.   Government wan  emphasizing  development  of  this
potentially rich resource, not only to substitute domestic vice production
for growing imports, but also to generate economic growth in this poor
region.  Experience with existing perimeters during the 1972/73 drought led
to the conclusion that partial water control irrigation designs, though
relatively cheap, could not assure production. Hence the design of the
project's irrigatioc systems, developed with the assiseance of a Technical
Assistance Credit, sought to balance low investment cost, effective water
control, and simple management appropriate for farmers inexperienced in
irrigated rice production. The project was identified and prepared within
the Bank's West Africa Agricultural Projects Division, with appraisal
completed by February, 1978, and Board approval in March, 1978.
ObJectives
2.        The project's objectives were to develop irrigation on 1100 ha at
Debi and 2200 ha at Lampsar, to benefit some 1100 farmers and their
families.   The  project  was  designed  to  (a) level  land,  establish
earthworks, and install and equip pump stations; (b) assist farmers to grow
and increase yields of paddy and tomatoes, initially during one crop season
per year; (c) conduct applied farming research appropriate to development
of small-farm irrigation in the delta; (d) prepare a development plan for
irrigation resources in the Senegal River Basin in view of dams then in the
planning stage; and (e) strengthen the implementing agency (SAED) to give
it the operational and planning capabilities. to oversee irrigation
development throughout the Senegal River Basin. Total project costs were
estimated at US$35 million, with the IDA credit of US$20 million going
primarily to development of Lampsar and preparation of the development
plan, a US$5.1 million Kuwait Fund credit enabling development of Debi, a
FAC grant of US$2.4 million covering technical assistance, and Government's
contribution of US$7 million covering a variety of local costs.
Implementation Experience
3.        Project construction began in January, 1979, after a delay of
almost a year caused by management changes at the implementing agency and
difficulties in finalizing the works supervision contract. While most of



- vi -
the origlally foreseen project components were completed well before the
intended final closing date of June 30. 1983, this was extended several
times to permit disbursement on added components including creation of
small village perimeters and rehabilitation of the Savoigne perimeter and
canal.   Final disbursement  and  the  eventual  closing  date  occured on
October 29, 1986. Although total disbursement of the Bank's US$ 20 million
credit only reached US$19.4 million, total project costs were US$36.7
million rather than the appraised eost of US$35 million.
4.        The originally designated net area for irrigation could not be
fully developed because of excessively saline and sandy soils encountered,
and because of a denser network of canals and dikes that resulted from
chifting from 3 ha to about 1 ha farm allocations. Over 20X (750 ha) of
the appraised area was thus lost, although this was partially compensated
for by development of other perimeters that were added to the project.
Production of tomatoes was abandoned after difficulties with the first crop
showed that the project soils were too heavy and saline for remunerative
yields.
Results
S.        Rice production has surpassed appraisal expectations both in
yields per hectare (4.8 ton/ha vs. 3.5 ton/ha) and for total annual project
production (13,015 tons vs. 10,150 tons). The reduced average farm size
that was implemented still provided positive financial results, partly
because  of  subsidized  water  costs  and  producer  price  supports.   The
economic result -- an IRR of -42 -- is not satisfactory, however, and is
below the appraisal estimate because no to-matoes could be grown, the CFA
value of paddy fell sharply, labor costs were underestimated, a project
cost overrun was incurred, and the estimated life span of the investment
was reduced (paras 4.01-4.03).
Sustainability
6.        Numerous uncertainties exist over future yields, crop rotations,
and  institutional  arrangements  at  the  project's  perimeters.   Ongoing
disengagement of SAED from provision of production inputs and tractor
services makes future production dependent on the development of private
market sources of supply, and during a transition period, yields may fall.
The refocussaing of SAED on planning and implementing irrigation development
in the Senegal River Valley continues the long and difficult matching of
capacity and mandate.
7.        Full  operation  of  the  Diama  and  Manantali  dams,  expected
beginning  1989,  will  enable  double  cropping,  though  socioeconomic
constraints are expected to keep cropping intensity below what is
technically feasible, at least initially.
8.        Adequate maintenance of the irrigation network continues to pose
difficulties because of insufficient operating funds, inadequate attention,
and inappropriate and limited equipment. These factors are contributing to
deterioration of the irrigation network and civil works that risks
shortening the investment's usable life.



- vii -
Findinas and Lessons
Lessons to be learned from the project include:
(a) The economics of rice irrigation projects in the delta are poor.
Higher valued crops need to be added to the crop rotation In
order to justify the Investment costs.   Moreover, multi-crop
rotations can be designed to reduce peak water demand, which
would enable reducing the scale and cost of the irrigation
infrastructure.
(b) Achieving the benefits of participatory farmer associations may
require   experimentation   before   appropriate   institutional
arrangements are found. At Debi-Lampsar, a range of groupings
exist, from the small village groups to the perimeter-wide
Comit6s Paritaires. This latter has only existed since 1983. and
is proving to be a good forum between SAED and farmers for
resolution of important production and management issues.
(c) There are indications that water-borne illnesses are increasing
as a consequence of the project, a situation likely to worsen
once  water  is  present  for  double  cropping.   Resources  are
currently inadequate for monitoring or mounting effective
programs to limJt these diseases.
(d) Better soil testing and mapping is needed to avoid the situation
where land in a perimeter has to remain undeveloped because of
excessive salinity or sandiness.
(e) Options for building flexidility into project implementation need
exploring.   Designs and contracts should enable changing the
scale of complementary investments when such components as
irrigated area are subject to revision. At Debi-Lampsar, the
originally designed pump capacity was installed despite a
significant reduction in need.

PROJECT COYPLETION REPORT
I. INTRODUCTION
Context
1.01      An enduring priority of Government agricultural policy in Senegal
is development of water resources to reduce dependGncy on risky rainfed
cereals  production  and  the  substantial  costs  of  imported  rice.   The
untapped potential of the Senegal River has been, even before the creation
Oc the Organisation pour la Mise en Valeur du fleuve Senegal (OMVS) by
Senegal,  Mali,  and  Mauritania  in  1972,  the  primary  focus  of  the
Government's irrigation investment strategy.  Regulation of the river's
flow through planned construction of Manantali Dam (upstream) and Diama iam
(delta) would create the potential _for irrigation of about 240,000 ha in
Senegal.   In the mid 1970's, Senegal, as part of OMVS, began to seek
international assistance in support of the tremendous institutional,
technical and financial effort needed to meet the target of 5w0Q ha
additional irrigated land per year.  The government agency charged with
coordinating this effort was the Socift6 Nationale d'Am6nagement et
d'Exploitation des Terres du Delta (SAED), originally created in 1965.
1.02      The Bank Group's first investment in development of the river's
irrigation potential began in 1973 with the Senegal River Polders Project
(Credit 350-SE). This IDA credit of US$ 4.5 million foresaw development of
3200 ha at Dagana in the upstream portion of the river's delta to permit
double cropping, as well as improvement of irrigation to allow single
cropping on 1780 ha at Debi and Lampsar. Implementation delays caused by
SAED's cumbersome administrative and financial procedures, difficulties
obtaining counterpart funds, as well as exchange rate changes led to
Dagana's costs exceeding total budget provisions. Nevertheless, costs per
hectare were  still reasonable by West  African  standards.   Meanwhile,
droughts in the early 1970's exposed the risks of partial water control
perimeters, such as was originally designed for Debi and Lampsar.  Further,
plans for Diama Dam made double cropping at these locations a feasibility,
though  requiring  a  different  technical  design.    In  reformulating
Credit 350-SE,  the Government requested financing to establish detailed
technical  designs  for  complete  water  control  at  Debi  and  Lampsar.
Credit 5-18-SE was signed in 1975 providing US$ 1.0 million towards
deveiopment of these engineering and cost estimate stuties.  Hence the
Debi-Lampsar Project (Credit 775-SE) was only the second Bank Group project
in irrigation in Senegal. All other Bank loans (one) and credits (10),
totalling US$ 52.3 million as of 1978 for the agricultural sector, were for
non-irrigation projects.

Objectives and Components
1.03      The concept of large-scale irrigation projects in the Senegal
River Basin addressed Government objectives of a) developing water
resources to reduce the risks of droughts; b) produce rice to offset the
trend of growing imports; and c) foster economic growth in the river basin,
both to alleviate poverty of the current residents, and to encourage
voluntary migration from the densely populated groundnut basin.
1.04      The present project was designed to fulfill these objectives
through upgrading the perimeters at Debi and Lampear from submersion
irrigation to complete water control. At appraisal, improvements were to
encompass 1100 ha at Debi and 2220 ha at Lampsar. For Debi, this entailed
construction of a pumping station drawing directly from the Senegal River,
an irrigation network of primary, secondary, and drainage canals, as well
as land levelling. The Lampsar site consisted of 11 sub-perimeters strung
along the Lampsar marigot, an offshoot of the Senegal River in the delta.
Construction of dikes on both banks of the marigot for flood protection, 14
pump stations (one for each sub-perimeter and three drainage system
stations), the canal system, and land levelling were the main irrigation
components. In addition, both perimeters were provided with an internal
dirt road network, and building infrastructure consisting of staff housing,
a perimeter office, a workshop, and central and field warehouses. Both
perimeters were also equipped with agricultural machinery, trucks and light
vehicules.
1.05      The direct beneficiaries were to be some 1100 farmers and their
families, each to receive a parcel of 3 ha.  They would benefit from
increased income resulting from production of paddy and tomatoes (for
canning at a nearby factory). SAED was to provide substantial assistance
in these new endeavors by supplying mechanical land preparation services,
crop inputs, marketing outlets, and extension services.
1.06      The project also sought to develop SAED's capacity to fulfill its
role as the agency responsible for Senegal's planning and execution of
irrigation development in the River Basin. Five technical assistants were
provided to reinforce planning, financial, and applied farming research
capabilities within SAED. Funds were also earmarked for consultants to
develop a master plan of irrigation development in the River Basin for
Senegal, as well as detailed technical studies of perimeters appropriate
for subsequent financing.
Financins Plan
1.07      Total  project  costs  were  estimated  at  USS 35 million  (see
Annex 1). A Kuwait Fund loan was to cover the complete costs of the Debi
component, or US$ 5.1 million.  The French (FAC) grant was designated for
the five expatriate technical assistants to SAED, at a cost of US$ 2.4
million.   The  IDA  credit  of  US$ 20 million  was  divided  among  the
development of Lampsar (US$ 12.5 million), technical assistance to applied
research and irrigation development planning (US$ 3.5 million), refinancing
the engineering credit S-18-SE (US$ 1 million), and price and physical
contingencies   (US$ 3 million).    Government   counterpart   funds   were



- 3 -
envisioned to total US$ 7.0 million. Hence the IDA loan was the largest
block of financing, contributing 572 of the total resources, and 801 of the
foreign exchange costs of Lampsar perimeter, the planning studies, and
applied research.
Pre-I!mlementation Issues and Processlng
1.08      Appraisal of the project raised six principal issues, two of
which  --  cost  recovery  and  organizational  aspects  -   proved  to  be
troublesome during implementation. Charges to farmers by SAED for water
and agricultural service costs were uniform throughout the delta at
appraisal, with reasonable recovery rates, i.e. 86S in 1976, but well below
cost recovery. It was recommended that the charges for water be raised to
recover operating and maintenance costs, plus as much of c capital costs
as would still maintain adequate farmer income.
1.09      Proposals for reorganization of SAED pre-dated the project, but
further steps were proposed to make operational the delegation of authority
to project units and greater financial autonomy for SAED.  As a state
corporation, SAED had to comply with complex financial and administrative
procedures, and had very little authority in budgetting and expenditure.
To remedy the delays and deterioration of SAED's financial situation, it
was proposed that a decree redefine SAED's relation to the State.
Short-term financing by the State was also arranged as a step to financial
viability for SAED.
1.10      Other issues were resolved by a) dropping from the project the
Diagambal perimeter for which USAID had arranged financing; b) filling a
financing gap through Kuwait Fund participation; c) evaluating project
benefits conservatively on the assumption that Diama Dam would not soon be
operational so as to permit double cropping; and d) arranging an agreement
between OMVS and Government on water rights, as would become relevant upon
Diama's completion.
1.11      Negotiations for financing the project took place in January 1978
with only minor difficulties. The water rights resolution requested by the
Bank was adopted  in time  for the negotiations.   However,  the decree
pertaining to the reorganization of SAED could not be ratified before
negotiation because of procedures necessary for amendment of State law.
Further, participation of the Kuwait Fund could not be made final as their
commitment awaited results of their own project evaluation. To hasten this
process between Government and the Kuwait Fund, the Credit Agreement was
amended to permit suspension of IDA disbursements for the project if the
Kuwait Funds finance was still unavailable by end-December, 1978.
1.12      Presentation before the Board occurred in tarch 1978, and did not
occasion any difficulties. Credit signing took place the same month, and
the credit became effective in July 1978.
II.  IMPLEMENTATION
2.01      Irrigation  works  of  the  project  were  completed  by  1984,



-4-
consisting of 3050 net hectares as compared to the appraisal target of 2980
net hectares. Despite the realized area surpassing the target, however, a
number of implementation delays and project revisions occurred.
Start-UJp
2.02      Start-up of construction work at Debi and Lampsar faced separate
problems. Those at Lampsar stemmed largely from transitional difficulties
as SAED went through a change of General Director in early 1978. Delays
were caused by the slow pace of preparing the major contract documents, and
disagreements between the World Bank and SAED, which wanted to select a
local firm as supervising contractor.  These difficulties were resolved,
and earthmoving and civil works began in January 1979, a year later than
foreseen in the Staff Appraisal Report (SAR).
2.03      For Debi delays resulted from several financing problems.  The
Kuwait Fund loan agreement was not signed until February 1979, two months
after the deadline permitting suspension of disbursements from the IDA
loan. Then the legal documents, which had been signed in Kuwait. were lost
in transit between Senegal's Ministry of Foreign Affairs and the Ministry
of Finance and Economic Affairs. It was not until February 1980 that the
documents were replaced and the Kuwait Fund loan finally made effective.
Meanwhile, experience gained during the work on Lampsar led the World Bank
to request a further delay on Debi to permit additional mapping to avoid
saline and sandy soils.
Revisions
2.04      Several changes were made at Lampsar in the area to be developed.
First, because of 151 devaluation of the dollar between the loan signing
and project start-up, as well as local price increases, there was a concern
about cost overruns. It was decided to forego development of the Ndiougue
sub-perimeter, where sandier soils would have led to particularly high
earthmoving costs.   Further area was lost due to a denser irrigation
network required by SAED's decision to establish 1.5 ha rather than 3.0 ha
farms (para 3.15), and because some of the original area had to be used
instead as a clay earth source for canal embankments. Lampsar's net area
was in this initiUl phase reduced from 2200 to 1670 ha.  As a cheaper
alternative to the Ndioungoe sub-perimeter, SAED proposed rehabilitation of
the 300 ha Savoigne perimeter adjacent to Lampsar. This was accepted by
the World Bank and completed in 1982. Finally, the strong recovery of the
dollar to over 150% of its SAR value in 1983 eased the local financing
constraint, and it was agreed in early 1984 to develop a portion of the
original Ndioungue sub-perimeter -- 140 ha, plus about 200 ha of small
perimeters (PIVs).  The decision to develop the PIVa was in response to
villagers' requests as drought conditions made rainfed cultivation of
millet impossible.
2.05      At Debi, the results of the additional soil testing led to a
reduction in area to be developed from 1100 ha to 740 ha.
2.06      Apart from these changes in area under development, there was
also a significant change in the basic farm system. As mentioned, the farm



- 5 -
size to be distributed was halved to a target of about 1.5 ha per family
although in practice the average is closer to 1.0 ha. Further, tomatoes
were dropped from the crop cycle, leaving paddy as the only production of
the perimeters. The reasons for these production changes are discussed in
Section III.
2.07      At the request of the borrower, a revision was made in financing
arrangements under the Credit Agreement whereby credit disbursements as a
proportion of total costs were permitted up to 100Z for all categories.
The original limits were 802 of irrigation and building costs, 752 of
operational costs (excluding salaries), 85% of technical assistance, and
752 of total vehicule and equipment costs. The revision was only relevant
for technical assistance as there was no financial contribution by the
Government to this category; all other categories did receive government
counterpart funds (see Annex II).
Implementation Schedule
2.08      After the initial start-up delays at Lampsar and Debi, the major
contracts for land levelling, earthmoving and civil works were completed in
the time allotted. Work went particularly quickly at Debi since the same
contractors as for Lampsar were engaged, and the necessary equipment was
already on location (see Table 1).
2.09      Difficulties  with  equipment  contracts  restricted  the  first
agricultural campaign in 1980/81 to only five of Lampsar's sub-perimeters.
One reason for the delay on equipment delivery was that contract awards
were still decided by the Ministry of Rural Development. SAED's technical
evaluations  of  bidding  documents  were  on  occasion  not  adequately
considered, and resolving this issue postponed several contract awards. As
a consequence, delayed delivery of pumps, agricultural machinery and siphon
tubing did not give sufficient time for equipment installation and
preparation of all the sub-perimeters of Lampsar until 1981. Procedurally,
the contract-granting process wst improved with SAED's change in legal
status in 1982, as it was given authority to make contract awards.
Procurement
2.10      On the whole, Bank procurement procedures were respected and were
ir accordance with Project Agreement  specifications.   These were  that
(i) international competitive bidding (ICB) apply to all earthworks, civil
works and irrigation equipment contracts surpassing US$ 100,000; (ii) local
competitive bidding (LCB) be used for agricultural and other equipment
contracts between US$ 15,000 and US$ 100,000, but not surpassing US$ 1
million total; and (iii) direct shopping be allowed for materials contracts
under US$ 15,000, but not surpassing US$ 0.5 million in total. All bid
documents and contract awards exceeding US$ 100,000 required prior World
Bank approval, as did negotiated contracts for consultants.

2.11      An exception was made in the construction of buildings which was
to be awarded through ICB but was finally awarded through LCB. This was
agreed to by the World Bank at the request of the borrover in view of
international contractor disinterest, and economies of cost and time in
being able to construct the Lampsar buildings in conjunction with the
adjacent N'Diayi training center, which had been contracted under LCB.
2.12      Another exception was granted on the US$ I million total limit on
contracts to be awarded under LCB. With the addition of small village
perimeters, Savoigue rehabilitation and Ndioungue development after the
main work of the project was completed, the value of LCB contracts
increased to about US$ 2.3 million.
2.13      Disbursements  from  the  IDA credit,  broken  down by  type  of
contract, are shown in Annex III. The fourteen ICB contracts accounted for
722 of credit disbursements. There were 35 LCB contracts with an average
value well below the minimum requiring World Bank review. Despite the
large number of LCB contracts, they only comprised 122 of total
disbursements.  Supervision of these contracts by SAED would have been
simplified by grouping them into larger lots.
costs
2.14      Total project costs were US$ 36.7 million compared with US$ 35.0
million at appraisal, for an overrun of 5% (see Annex I). Project costs
were influenced at first by a depreciating dollar, but benefitted beginning
in 1981 from a strengthening dollar which decreased the dollar cost of the
CPA denominated contracts.  Since about half of project costs, such as
irrigation development costs at Debi, and much of the technical assistance,
came after the dollar strengthened, exchange rate movements are not the
primary factor in the modest cost overrun.   If the exchange rate at
appraisal (CFA 245/US$) had held throughout the project, there would have
been an 11 overrun in dollar costs, as there was in CFA terms. Appraisal
provisions for physical contingencies were 152 for all works, equipment,
agricultural inputs and operational costs, 202 for applied research, and 0X
for other studies. The weighted average price contingency applied to total
project costs was 232.  Because of the delay in project start-up, this
price contingency proved inadequate.
2.15      The  largest  cost overrun was  for  irrigation  investments  at
Lampsar, where expenditure was almost US$ 5 million greater than, or 151%
over, the appraised costs including price and physical contingencies.
Costs of earthmoving were higher than anticipated, and components to
rehabilitate Savoigne and develop village perimeters were added.  There
were also substantial overruns for vehicules and equipment, by 29% of
appraised costs at Debi, and by over 1202 at Lampsar. Finally, there were
disturbing increases in salary and operational costs. Salaries at Lampsar
were 317% of appraisal estimates, mostly because of a rapid increase in
staff size. The salary and operational cost increase was partly the result
of SAED decentralisation not totally foreseen at appraisal, but considered
desirable. Staff increases were excessive however, and an implementation
of cutbacks has begun. Including all project costs, per hectare costs of



- 8 -
irrigation development were US$ 8,500 at Debi and US$ 10,000 at Lampsar,
compared with appraisal estimates of US$ 6,800 and USS 8,400.
Disbursements
2.16      A total of US$ 19.4 million was disbursed out of the US$ 20.0
million World Bank credit. At the original closing date of June 1983 only
US$ 16.5 million had been disbursed, but the effective closing date was
extended several times to permit further withdrawals for work on Savoigne,
Ndioungue and the small village perimeters. The loan balance of US$ 0.6
million was cancelled in October 1986. Projected and actual disbursements
by category are shown in Annex I. A comparison of the actual disbursement
profile and that projected at appraisal is shown in the Basic Data Sheet.
Contractor Performance
2.17      Technical  designs,  physical  works,  provision  of  equipment,
supervision and the audit that were done by contractors were in general
carried out  satisfactorily.   Several difficulties  that did arise were
solved without major project  delays.   At Lampsar,  land levelling was
inadequate on 500 ha and had to be redone by the contractor.  Also, at
three perimeters, the contractor constructed canals with walls that were
too steep causing problems with erosion, apparently because the proper
equipment was not yet on location. Remedial grading was eventually carried
out on these canals by SAED. The same contractor later executed irrigation
earthworks at Debi with no problems. Delivery of pumps to Lampsar also
experienced problems when the pumps were diverted by the Government before
installation  to emergency pumping of drinking water  for Dakar.   SAED
subsequently refused delivery of the used pumps, until an agreement was
negotiated whereby the contractor refurbished the pumps and extended the
warranty from one year to three agricultural seasons.
III. AGRICULTURAL IMPACT
Summary of Incremental Output
3.01      Incremental agricultural production resulting from the project
has surpassed appraisal expectations for paddy, but has not been realized
for tomatoes.  Additional paddy production has reached  11,655 tons per
year, or 33% better than originally foreseen  (see Table 2).  This  is
because realized yields averaging 4.5 T/ha at Lampsar and 5.5 T/ha at Debi
are significantly higher than the conservative appraisal estimates of
3.5 T/ha. Production of tomatoes for canning has been abandonned, and the
absence of this high value crop from the rotation severely affects the
financial and economic benefits of the project.  Before the project, a
smaller area (depending on rainfall) averaged only 0.8 T/ha, the lower
yields being the consequence of negligable water control and no chemical
input use.
Cropping Pattern, Land Use, and Yields
3.02      Attempts to grow tomatoes at Lampsar were abandonned for several
reasons. Appraisal crop rotations foresaw tomatoes entering every third



-9-
year on to paddy fields.  With the heavy clay soils of the area, this
turned out to require difficult and expensive mechanical preparations of
the land, since parcels levelled for paddy flooding had to be converted to
sloped ridges for tomatoes' row irrigation.  If done improperly, ridging
did not allow for an even distribution of water, and yield reduction or
crop loss resulted.   An additional problem was salinity of the soil,
exacerbated by the groundwater level being close to the surface, and salt
levels building up through surface evaporation. Although this problem was
thoroughly anticipated and salinity levels determined to be acceptable
prior to appraisal, the problem was accentuated by ridging difficulties,
which resulted in inadequate maintenance of fresh water delivery to the
tomatoes' root zone.
3.03      This problem appears to be particular to Lampsar, and has been
avoided in other delta irrigation perimeters through proper selection of
soils on which to cultivate tomatoes. Irrigation perimeters are generally
developped from natural basins, which have lighter soils on the upper
slopes of the terrain. These soils are much easier to switch from ridged
to flood irrigation, and hence are more appropriate for polyculture
rotations.   But at Lampsar,  such light soils are rarer,  or were not
developped.
3.04      Realized  area  of harvested  paddy  in  1986/87 was  officially
2733 ha, or 94% of the appraised total. Difficulties with land development
encountered during project implementation accounted for the area reduction
at Debi, but some of the lost area was compensated for by the Savoigne
Perimeter rehabilitation and small village perimaters at Lampsar (para
2.04).   Temporary  problems  with  debt  repayment  at  Lampsar  and  late
availability of irrigation water at Savoigne also idled about 300 ha in
1986/87.
3.05      Paddy continues to be cultivated only once per year with the
exception of a small second crop of 200 ha first attempted in 1986.  A
second crop is currently limited by uncertainty over the availability of
non-saline irrigation water, a situation which will persist at least until
the Manantali Dam on an upstream tributary of the Senegal River is fully
operational, anticipated in 1989. The Diama Dam near the mouth of the
Senegal River, designed to prevent the upstream movement of salt water as
the fresh water flow declines in the dry season, is not at present capable
of guaranteeing this function. Lacking a dike on the Mauritanian side of
the river, as well as an adequate flow of fresh water in the dry season,
Diama operators are not able to maintain a high enough water level behind
the dam for the design of the watergates.  These ha-ve to be opened when the
downstream water level rises too high, thus letting salt water pass into
the upper reaches of the delta. Diama's operators feel assured that this
problem will be resolved once Manantali Dam permits regulation of an
adequate, year-round flow of fresh water, even without the Mauritanian
dike. This will ensure sufficient water for irrigation of additional crops
per year, potentially two rice crops plus a fast maturing vegetable or
legume. However, SAED personnel feel that initially a cropping intensity
greater than 160% will be hard to achieve, particularly at Lampsar.

Reasons given are proximity to St. Louis, which offers alternative
activities to LaApsar residents, who are in effect part-time farmers.
Simple habituation to year-round cultivation is also thought to be at least
a transitional problem.
3.06      At Lampear, the total area available has not been cultivated
beginning in 1985 with the implementation of a new SAED policy for farmers
not repaying their prcduction credits. SAED has begun to refuse additional
production credits until farmers repay these debts, and at Lampsar, the
land thus idled -- about 10X of the total - has not been redistributed or
otherwise cultivated.  The problem has not arisen at Debi, where debt
repaynent of nearly 1002 is the norm. In fact, the situation appears to be
particular to Lampsar; at other perimeters where the SAID policy is being
applied to non-repayment of debt, the affected land is distributed among
existing or new cultivators. But at Lampsar, village organization is such
that farmers are so far unwilling to lay claim to the idle land of their
neighbors.
3.07      Effectiv-  area  benefitting  from  irrigation  is  greater  than
official area at Lampsar because of water "pirating'. This consists of
unauthorized use of perimeter irrigation water on adjacent parcels by
single cultivators or informal village  groups.   The area involved at
Lampsar is thought to have reached 200 ha, or a 102 addition to official
area.   Rice  is  usually  cultivated.   Such  water  pilfering  is  quite
destructive to the irrigation earthworks, with syphons eroding primary
canal embankments, PCU tubing being extended from secondary canals under
roads and over drainage ditches, and even rudimentary canals connecting
directly to the primary canal.  Control of this situation iF to date
limited to SAED intervening to impose water charges where "pirates" can be
identified; actual suppression of the activity, especially during the
recent drought years when rainfed agriculture was foresaken, would have
created frictions with villages that' SAED preferred to avoid. Resolution
of the problem will have to come through self-policing by cultivators, and
may be aided by recent changes in perimeter institutions (para 5.11).
3.08      Yield performance has far outpaced appraisal expectations for
paddy.   These were  projected  to  increase  from  1.8 T/ha  initially to
3.5 T/ha over four years. Initial yields already exceeded 3.5 T/ha, and
through 1986 averaged 4.5 T/ha at Lampsar and 5.5 T/ha at Debi. The higher
level of yields does not have any apparent explanation; total fertilizer
use is in fact a bit iower than appraisal recommendations, although there
is a higher proportion of urea being applied.
3.09      Yields  at Debi are  quite  stable,  but  at Lampsar are more
variable, and fell to 3.9 T/ha in 1986. The reason appears to be Lampsar's
greater susceptibility to the late arrival of flood waters. There is an
additional delay at Lampsar, since once the flood waters push back the salt
water intrusion, the Lampsar marigot must still be filled before irrigation
of the sub-perimeters becomes possible.  Hence the date of planting at
Lampsar is often later than at Debi, and this is related to lower yields.
In fact, at the Savoigne perimeter, which depends on gravity flow for the
primary canal from the Lampsar marigot, the arrival of water was so late in
1986 that it was decided to completely forego planting in the main season.



- 12 -
3.10      The reason for higher yields at Debi than at Lampsar is not
entirely  clear.   Physical  inputs  for  the  two  perimeters  are  almost
identical.  One suggestion is that Laspsar farmers, being quite close to
St. Louis, have more varied activities and do not perform their crop
operations in as timely or complete a fashion as at Debi.  Agronomic
practices, levels of input use, and soil quality are quite similar between
the two areas, and in the absence of a clear technical basis for the yield
difference, managerial explanations carry some weight.
3.11      A more perplexing yield difference exists between the above
results, based on SAED crop cutting samples, and farmers' recall estimates,
summarized in a 1986 SAED survey at Lampsar. Farmer estimates averaged
3.2 T/ha for 1985, well below the crop cutting estimate of 4.5 T/ha. SAED
explains the difference as resulting from farmers not estimating some
production  as  part  of  their  declared  total.   They  may  not  include
quantities consumed by the family during the prolonged harvest and
threshing period, in-kind payments to hired labor, gifts to parents, and
religious tithes. If all these deductions do in fact occur, and are not
reported as part of production, then the 4.5 T/ha SAED yield estimated does
appear valid.
3.12      Yield trends in the future are uncertain because of competing
influences.  There will likely be a negative short-term impact of SAED
disengagement  from  input  provision.   Private  or  cooperative  tractor
services and market supply of fertilizer and other chemicals are still
inadequate to provide sufficient supply at peak-demand periods. Over a
longer period, the ordinary practice of dry-soil tillage without subsequent
puddling will lead to poor land levelling and lower yields.
Farmer Participation and Benefits
3.13      A total of 2627 farm units were recorded by SAED as of 1986,
encompassing 1945 units at Lampsar and 682 un'-ts at DEbi (see Table 3).
Recipients were typically male heads of households, with average family
size estimated at appraisal of eight members. Direct beneficiaries of the
project thus total at least 21,000, and may be higher taking into account a
recent SAED survey at Lampsar which showed average family size of almost
thirteen members.
3.14      Distribution  of  land  was  facilitated  by  participation  of
permanent village residents in SAED's flood irrigation activities that
pre-dated the current project. There were thus existing farmer groups that
served, as a basis for determining eligible farmers. Legal ownership of the
land was vested in the State by a 1966 law, and SAED was designated to
select recipients of user rights.
3.15      Through a reduction of the land allocation per farm from the
appraisal provision of 3 ha, the project has spread benefits across a
greater number of recipients. A request for revision of the proposed farm
model by SAED was motivated by several concerns. Demand was greater than
land available using 3 ha farms, and there was no simple way to select
among claimants. Productivity in existing SAED projects was observed to be
higher on smaller farms, so reducing farm size within the limits of



- 13 -
maintaining adequate financial incentives was also seen as a way of
reaching higher total production. Finally, there was a concern that simple
allocation of 3 ha tracts did not adequately calibrate farm size to
variable family labor resources. A rough eotimate of 0,25 ha per active
adult was determined by SAED and apparently applied to give bigger families
more area. Recorded land allocations average one hectare per farm unit,
which corresponds with the four active adults per lamily estimated at
appraisal.
3.16      It is doubtful that this average 1.0 ha farm is meaningful as a
representative farm in the project area. Recorded average farm sizes by
sub-perimeter within Lampsar vary by a factor of over two-and-a-half, from
a minimum of 0.7 ha at Keur S. Sow to a maximum of 1.8 ha at Ndioungue.
The actual range of farm size as operated in practice may be even larger.
While there are no figures on farm size distribution within the project, it
is probable that informal social mechanisms have led to some effective
reallocation of decision control over land, and that is not reported to
SAED. Inflated claims of resident active adults per family, the existence
of patron-client family relations, and the consequences of informal credit
relations are only several channels by which decision control over land may
have become more diverse than the simple one hectare farm model implies.
This diversity has important consequences for financial benefits to
participating farmers.
3.17      Financial returns to farmers estimated at appraisal are compared
to results estimated for 1986 in Table 4. Only returns for rice production
are compared since the appraisal farm model with tomato production is not
practiced. Appraisal financial returns are adjusted to current values by
appplying 1986 prices to appraisal quantities where this is possible.
Mechanical services and water charges are treated differently as these were
scheduled at appraisal to increase during project implementation, and these
fee changes are used for the appraisal model's 1986 costs.
3.18      Actual  net  production  value  per  hectare  exceeds  appraisal
expectations by 20Z. Higher yields are being realized without significant
increases in production inputs, although there is unforeseen substitution
of  hired  for  family  labor  during  harvesting  and  threshing.   Actual
production value net of costs arrives at 3309 CFA per manday of family
labor, exceeding the appraisal of 2594 CFA per manday, and far surpassing
peak hired wages of about 1000 CFA per day.
3.19      The cash flow of rice production presents some problems once
family consumption of own rice production and the range of farm size at
Laupsar are taken into account. Annual rice consumption of an eight member
family is perhaps 180 kg/year of rice (paddy * 0.65) per person, or
2.2 tons of paddy per year total. If families consume just this amount,
then on an average 1 ha farm, marketings would be 532 of production.  After
paying for production costs (usually paid in-kind) the remaining cash
income is 66,000 CFA ($190), or 857 CFA per manday ($2.45) of family labor.
But for smaller farms within the range found at Lampsar, the cash value of
production remaining after household consumption appears insufficient to
cover production costs.   For the 0.7 ha average farm of Keur S. Sow,
household food needs absorb two-thirds of paddy production, and the

residual marketings fall short of input costs by almost 10,000 CFA. Such
households evidently compensate by falling behind in debt payments, by
paying for production costs of paddy from other sources of income, or by
consuming less rice from own production (see para 6.06).
3.20      While most farms at Lampsar and Debi do not currently face this
cash flow problem, they are not far removed from its consequences. First,
there is little scope for accommodating ongoing population growth in the
project villages through sub-division of existing allocations.   Second,
although irrigation water fees are well below costs for its provision,
raising them would fall particularly heavily on small farmers, even while
larger farmers could feasibly absorb the higher rate.
3.21      Farmers have also benefitted from the opportunity to improve
their farm management skills, in addition to the incremental financial
rewards. The techniques of intensive irrigation production of paddy were
new to the farmers at the project's outset, and were learned over a
relatively short period of  time.   Timing and application of chemical
fertilizers, use of herbicides and pesticides along with maintenance of
spraying equipment, proper timing of seeding and cultural operations, and
management of water resources are all skills that farmers have begun to
master. These fundamentals of more sophisticated, productive, and flexible
farming are transferable to other crop activities of farmers.
3.22      Not all the potential or desirable development of farm management
skills has occurred, however. The substantial direct involvement of SAED
in production and marketing has isolated farmers from a range of decisions.
How to transfer these additional responsibilities to farmers is now a
pressing problem as SAED seeks to disengage from these activities.
Mechanized land preparation and input supply has in the past been provided
by SAED, but farmers are in the future going to have to seek these inputs
from private suppliers or perhaps through cooperative organization of
tractor services. SAED will continue to provide a market outlet for paddy
at an official producer price, though finance difficulties often delay or
limit the purchasing campaign.  But the high official price is usually
sufficient to keep farmers from making sales on the parallel market.  In
short, farmers need to actively seek out and develop market relations for
input supply and paddy sales was limited until recently. Whether they can
acquire these economic management zkills apace with SAED's scheduled
disengagement is a key unknown for the immediate future of the project.
Other Non-Quantifiable Project Effects
3.23      Health.  The overall health impact of the project is difficult to
assess because improved food availability and access to potable water have
coincided with an increase in water-borne or related diseases.  On the
positive side, 79Z of a Lampsar sample perceive greater food availability,
accompanied by a switch from a millet-bssed to a rice-based diet. Debi's
population has benefitted greatly from the construction of Diama Dam, which
for the first time provides them with non-saline water during the dry
season. But 452 of Lampsar respondants felt that family health was worse

than before, with 761 of all families remarking an increase in maladies,
and 991 observing a greater problem with mosquitoes. This health problem
is related to the longer period of standing water in irrigation systems and
marigots, and perhaps to greater water contact of the project's population
through the convenience of the irrigation networks cement structures as
bathing and laundry spots. The environment for mosquitoes and water-borne
disease vectors will become even more propitious after 1989 when irrigation
water for year-round cropping will become available.  Preventive health
measures through prophylactics, canal maintenance, and mosquito control are
minimal, as is SAED's collaboration with health services. Definition of
institutianal responsibility and allocation of resources do not appear
adequate to deal with the worsening health situation.
3.24      Family  Stability.    A  Government  objective  of  irrigation
development in the delta is to provide economic opportunities for the local
population and reduce migration to urban centers. This appears to have
occurred on one level, as Lampsar respondants observe fewer family member
departures in 922 of the cases, and 94Z more arrivals.  Two-thirds of
sampled families also claimed a reduced number of social problems wlthin
the family.   But the control of household heads over family labor is
thought by some SAED observers to be diminishing, *in Pirt explaining the
recourse to hired labor for harvest activities.  Increased opportunities
for cash income are apparently contributing to the financial independence
of wives and sons, and loosening the ties of the extended family as a work
unit. This limited evidence suggests that the local economy may be
broadening but that labor arrangements for farm production are becoming
more flexible and complex.   Hence a more stable economy than existed
previously under rainfed conditions is not necessarily translating into
greater stability of family structure.
3.25      Job Creation.  zecause the project has established a more labor
intensive crop activity than existed previously, there has been an increase
in productive labor. Much of this increase is accounted for by migrant
laborers, who arrive from the Groundnut Basin for paddy harvesting and
threshing. These laborers are not currently permanent migrants to the
area, as there is only call for their services for at most two months per
year. With the development -of year-round irrigation, this situation may
change, as within the delta there will be two rice harvests and a tomato
harvest for which labor is also hired. More permanent residence may be
established by farm laborers under these conditions, with beneficial
effects on the local economy.
IV. ECONOMIC RATE OF RETURN ANALYSIS
4.01      The rec&lculated rate of return on the project is -42 compared to
102 at appraisal. The rate of return was recalculated taking into account
costs of all realized investments and variable production inputs, plus
costs after 1986 consisting of periodic replacement of medium term
investments, production inputs, operations and maintenance and SAED project
salaries stated in 1986 CFA.  Costs associated with technical assistance,
applied research, and general studies are excluded. Benefits resulting
from paddy production are also in 1986 terms, with future prices of paddy,
chemical inputs, as well as exchange rates calculated using World Bank



- 18 -
forecasts (see Annex IV for details on the assumptions used for the
economic analysis).
4.02      The rate of return calculated at appraisal and in this report is
based on incremental net benefits, that is project net benefits greater
than those realized from without-project agricultural  activities.   The
recalculated rate of return retains the appraisal assumption that earlier
agricultural production on the project site consisted of paddy on 2,900 ha,
with an average yield of 0.8 TIha. The low average yields are due to
uncertain soil moisture under flood recession agrici'lture, and the absence
of purchased inputs.
4.03      The decrease in the rate of return is the result of (i) the
inability to cultivate a tomato crop which at appraisal was to account for
nearly half of net incremental benefits at Lampsar, and a third overall;
(ii) beginning in 1986, sharply reduced CFA value of paddy output,
resulting from depressed world market dollar prices, combined with a
declining CFA/US$ exchange ratio. In fact, because of this output value
decline, the project's net incremental benefit stream turns negative from
1986 to 1992; (iii) inclusion of periodic, post-project costs for medium
term investments -- pumps, agricultural and maintenance machinery -
without which production for the estimated 25 year life span of the
earthworks and civil works will not be sustainable. Such periodic costs
were not included in the appraisal calculation; (iv) a project cost overrun
of 11% in CPA terms; (v) higher labor costs because of higher shadow wages
in constant terms. Labor costs per hectare are evaluated at the market
costs of hiring labor for harvesting (18,000 CFA/ha) and threshing
(350 CFA/80 kg sack), plus a subsistence wage of 150 CFA/day for family
labor that is used for the remaining 77 days of cultural operations. The
opportunity cost of labor per hectare of paddy, calculated on the basis of
a 4.5 ton yield, is thus 50,000 CPA; and (vi) shortening of the project
life from 50 to 25 years. Fifty years seems excessive in view of the rapid
deterioration of past irrigation investments in the delta, and SAED's own
depreciation schedule which gives irrigation works a 20-year life span.
Appraisal sensitivity calculations estimated that a 10% fall in benefits or
a 102 increase in project costs would each cause a 12 decline in the
internal rate of return. Extrapolation of these relations and shortening
of the project life span explain much of the realised decline in economic
profitability of the project.
4.04      Because there is considerable uncertainty over future effects of
institutional, paddy price and exchange rate changes on the potential
stream of project benefits, sensitivity analysis was used to determine
factors which would produce a positive  internal rate of return.   An
optimistic crop scenario still envisions only paddy production, but
projects a cropping intensity of 200% from 1989 on, rather than the base
case 160%.  The resulting IRR only improves to -2%, because at the low
paddy prices through 1993, the additional area merely adds production which
occurs at a net economic loss. An alternative scenario substitutes a more
stable,   medium-term  exchange   rate  profile   for  the  base   case's
"#overshooting"  assumption.   The  latter,  which  has  the  CFA/US$  rate
strengthening from 349 in 1986 to 254 in 1989, is replaced by a profile
which strengthens to 300 in 1987, returns to 325 through 1991, then



- 19 -
averages 367 for the remainder of the project.  With this alternative
exchange rate scenario, the IRR rises to -3%. Finally, the project life
was extended from 25 to 50 years, resulting in the IRR improving to 2%.
Benefits in distant years have a fairly major impact on the IRR in this
case, because its low value means such benefits are discounted less.
4.05      Note that in these IRR calculations the Manufacturing Unit Index
(MUV) deflator has been used to adjust project investment costs to get
constant 1986 CFA values.   This is consistent with treatment of paddy
output valuation, but as a practical matter, it is unclear whether using a
domestic GDP deflator for project costs would not be preferable.  The
latter, because of high Senegalese inflation, increases investment costs in
1986 terms, and results in a base case IRR of -7%, compared to -4% using
the MUV. Summing these three scenarios, for which the changes in IRR are
two, one and six points respectively, or nine points in total, yields an
IRR of 5%.
V. INSTITUTIONAL PERFORMANCE AND DEVELOPMENT
Organization and Administration
5.01      The implementing agency for the Debi-Lampsar Project was the
Societe Nationale d'Am6nagement et d'Exploitation des Terres du Delta du
Flewve Senegal (SAED). Just prior to project preparation, SAErD had been
reorganized to adapt to its increasing responsibilities throughout the
Senegal River Basin. This initial reorganization, which grouped perimeters
into "project units" of about 5000 ha each, and created new divisions of
Perimeter Coordination, Finance and Accounting, and Administration and
Personnel, left several issues unaddressed that were important to the new
project. While these were recognized in the appraisal report, the proposed
solutions were overtaken by new difficulties and further organizational
changes beginning in 1981 that altered the fundamental legal, procedural
and structural characteristics of SAED.  Many of the changes addressed
institutional issues more general than the specific organizational needs of
the Debi-Lampsar Project, and hence will not be treated in depth in this
report.
5.02      SAED was created as a state corporation, and as such had to
comply with complicated financial and administrative procedures.   Most
serious among these was the extremely tight control exercised by the
Government over bidding procedures and expenditure. Accounts were kept by
a central agency in Dakar for all public corporations, with almost all
contracts and expenditures requiring complex clearance by this central
agency. Prior experience was that this system was fraught with delays,
inefficiency and deterioration of SAED's financial situation.  To avoid
these problems during project implementation, the credit opening was made
contingent upon signing of a financing agreement by the Government assuring
regular budget transfers to SAED's account, and a decree easing the
requirements on prior approval of expenditures.
5.03      These  limited  procedural  reforms  were  superseded  by  the
recommendations of a joint CCCE/FAC/IDA review of SAED, which reported in
March 1979.  These were that (i) SAED's financial autonomy be extended



- 20 -
through a change in legal status; (ii) SAED's activities be focussed on
paddy production and maintenance of irrigation works, while abandoning
execution of irrigation works and studies implementation; (iii) SAED's
central services be organized under three new divisions -- Administration
and Finance, Production, and Engineering; (iv) project perimeters be given
greater autonomy throughl staffing with higher level managers, and
suppression of the Coordination of Perimeters Division; (v) reduction of
SAED's staff be implemented. This reorganizational approach was accepted
at an interministerial meeting. With financing from FAC and the Public
Sector Technical Assistance Project, a three member team of expatriate
consultants was in place by March 1980 to work in conjunction with SAED's
General Manager to carry out the reorganization. By July 1981, the new
organizational structure was in operation, and SAED's change in legal
status to a National Society, with greater budget autonomy, formalized by
Law N' 81-57. Since, the mutual financial and operational responsibilities
of the State and SAED have been defined over three year periods in a
contractual Letter of Mission.
Staff and Training Issues
5.04      Within  this  general  and  evolving attempt  to  improve  SAED's
institutional health, the project foresaw specific areas where strong
management was necessary for proper project implementation. Funds for five
technical assistants were provided, one for improving financial management
procedures at SAED headquarters, a project director and mechanic for the
Lampsar perimeter, and two applied research specialists. All five were
expatriates. The project director for Debi was selected from within SAED.
The strong pressure from the World Bank to include expatriate technical
assistants in the project apparently was the source of some friction during
project preparation. This did not cause any specific problems, but there
was a notable absence in the project documents of a strategy for training
SAED staff to eventually replace the expatriates.   The World Bank was
unwilling to finance overseas training for a SAED staff member who was to
assume responsibility as director of Lampsar perimeter.  Bilateral funds
for this were eventually arranged on an ad hoc basis.  This donor was
involved from the beginning in project financing, and the World Bank could
have shown more sensitivity to the expatriate issue by encouraging
incorporation of a SAED staff training component in the project.  As it
was, any such training was left undefined and dependent upon an, as of
then, incomplete training project under separate donor financing.
5.05      Greater perimeter autonomy was planned for Debi and Lampsar to
give the project directors sufficient authority and flexibility to ensure
timely completion of the investments and beginning of agricultural
activities. Decentralisation was to be achieved through separate project
management teams with technical and administrative independence, and
partial financial autonomy via establishment of separate project accounts.
In the initial recruitment stage, Lampsar was staffed with two extension
officers, seven extension agents, and a procurement officer in addition to
the expatriate project director and mechanic. Despite some difficulties in
establishing  operational  procedures  between  the  project  and  SAED
headquarters, these were largely resolved by 1983, when decentralization
into Autonomous Perimeters was institutionalized throughout the delta.



- 21 -
5.06      One  consequence  of  devolving  greater  responsibility  to  the
perimeter level was a rapid growth in project staff. Lampsar personnel
expanded to 48 employees, consisting of 11 administrative staff, 17
extension workers, 9 tractor drivers, and 11 workshop employees.  With
SAED's disengagement from production services, the number of personnel will
be reduced, although a specific calendar has not been establlshed.
Production-oriented training for farmers and SAED personnel was not a
specific component of the project since other donors were financing a
separate  but  complementary  training project  for  SAED.   This  included
construction of a training center at N'Diaye, within Lampsar's area. The
center became operational about when Lampsar investments were completed,
and has since provided valuable training to operational staff of SAED.
5.07      Pump operators were recruited from project villages and given
practical training. Thirteen pumpists were selected from village sections
(para 5.10) at Lampsar by means of a simple examination. They were then
given two months of practical training at already  wuctioninug pump statiorns
in the Delta, plus two months of mechanical training at the workshop in
Ross-Bethio, and one month of course work. Tractor drivers were villagers
who had previous experience as drivers for SAED elsewhere in the Delta. An
additional six drivers who were trained for the project were villagers who
had previously worked for SAED in other capacities.
Farmer Organizations
5.08      Since the beginning of the project there has been a significant
evolution of farmer organizations which collaborate with SAED to manage the
perimeters.   There are now three levels of organization,  with farmers
represented  at  each  level.   Along  with  the  development  of  these
organizations, there has been a fundamental shift in SAED's approach from
firm direction to collaboration.
5.09      Farmer groups have existed since the project origins, and consist
of about forty farmers who cultivate adjacent plots provisioned by the same
secondary canal.   These groups have a simple administrative  structure
including a President, Treasurer, and pump operator. The positions are
elective.    SAED  has  assisted  these  groups  through  literacy  and
administrative tranfng} as well es *grnnomic advice of extension agents.
These groups are responsible for coordinating basic production activities
such as water delivery, crop spraying, as well as for maintenance of
secondary and tertiary canals and dikes within their irrigation quarter.
5.10      Beginning in 1982, the farmer groups were organized into village
sections. These correspond roughly with sub-perimeters at Lampsar, where
there are eleven; at Debi there are five.  The administration of these
includes a President, Marketing Agent, Treasurer, Credit Manager and
Secretary, with these positions filled through elections every three years.
The village sections are responsible at the beginning of each agricultural
campaign of establishing a calendar for water delivery, overseeing the
provision of inputs, and keeping accounts for inputs and services supplied
on credit. At harvest they organize weighing and sacking of paddy, in-kind
payment of production credit, and short-term storage until SAED finance and
transport is available for marketings. The village sections have been the



- 22 -
main point of contact for SAED's provision of production inputs and
marketing services.
5.11      To Increase participation of villagers in perimeter management, a
joint SAED-farmer "Comite Paritaire de Gestion" (CPG) was established in
1983 at Lampsar. The concept has since been extended to other perimeters
including Debi (in conjunction with Boundoum perimeter). The CPG consists
of four SAED perimeter representatives and four elected representatives of
the  perimeter  village  sections.   It  has  authority  on  questions  of
(i) implementation  of  the  agricultural  program;   (ii) input  supply;
(iii) water delivery; (iv) maintenance; (v) monitoring; (vi) marketing; and
(vi) credit. Initially the CPG had difficulty meshing the issues raised by
the farmer representatives with an official administrative strucrure. But
it is proving to be an invaluable vehicule for giving farmers a voice in
operational matters and helping SAED become a more responsive agen,y. For
certain delicate problems such as determining crop losses and establishing
penalties for debt delinquents, the CPG's decisions have been more
acceptable to farmers since taken by their representatives.
5.12      Despite   this   impressive   institutionalization   of   farmer
participation at all levels of perimeter management, some problems need
further attention. Key among these is how and at what level to control the
current unauthorized diversion of irrigation water to privately developed,
adjacent plots. Enforcement is difficult from a social point of view when
the unauthorized cultivation is with the tacit consent of farmers within
the irrigation project, or is by a powerful individual.  The costs of
additional pumping and accelerated deterioration of the irrigation network
are diffuse and perhaps more acceptable than the social tensions created by
suppressing the activity. The decision whether to suppress or identify and
establish charges for this unauthorized cultivatior needs to be taken by
the CPG since it applies to the entire perimeter. But effective monitoring
will require the full collaboration of the village sections.
5.13      Inadequate  cohesion within  some  village  sections  is also a
problem.  Some have not succeeded in establishing a calendar for water
delivery that is respected by the sections'  farmers.   Inadequate water
during key periods in the growing cycle, and breaking of dikes to gain
access to water have resulted in these cases. The problem is complex since
it involves a mix of social cleavages, managerial inexperience, and
technical  limitations  of  the  irrigation  network.    The  managerial
deficiencies may be central enough to warrant additional training and
extension efforts, and exchanges with more successfully managed sections.
Farm Credit, Financial Performance, and Cost Recovery
5.14      Provision  of  farm  credit  became  a  major  feature  of  the
relationship between SAED aitd project farmers, In essence, all production
inputs with the exception of family labor were provided on credit to
farmers. Repayment came in-kind at harvest, and was facilitated by SAED
controlling the market for paddy. This credit system worked in some ways
to the benefit of farmers. It transferred much of the risk of crop failure
to SAED, since when such crop losses occurred, credit repayment was
typically cancelled.  There were instances of farmers arranging to have



- 23 -
crop failure officially declared even when harvests were possible, since
this could increase net returns.  SAED has managed to bring this practice
to a halt. The credit system has also been the channel for supporting farm
income. Until recently, fertilizer and tractor services were priced below
cost, as water still is. Further, the producer price for paddy is higher
than the economic price, thus making it easier to pay off the credit.
5.15      Financial performance of this credit system has in general been
good. Debt repayment rates at Debi are consistently near 100%. Repayment
rates are somewhat less at Lampsar, and in the past two seasons SAED has
refused to provide additional services to farmers who are delinquent. This
is causing some land to remain uncultivated, but this is probably only
temporary.
5.16      Cost recovery for the irrigation network was a major issue during
project preparation. Farmers are charged for water use by the hectare, but
do not pay any other charges such as a land tax. Prior to the project, the
basic water fee was CFA 25,000 per hectare for paddy. The loan agreement
provided for a periodic review of these charges to permit raising them when
possible while  still providing adequate net  incomes  for farmers.   At
appraisal, it was thought that it would be possible to raise the water
charges for paddy to CFA 35,000 per hectare (and from CFA 35,000 to
CFA 50,000 per hectare for tomatoes), and that on the basis of the proposed
farm models, this would cover 17% of total project costs, or 100% of
operations and maintenance, and 12% of investment costs.
5.17      The actual water fee was kept at CFA 25,000 per hectare for paddv
through the first four agricultural campaigns.   It was then raised to
CFA 41,000 in 1984/85, where it remained in 1986/87. This was sufficient
to pay for only 17% of total project costs in 1984 (amortisation of
investment costs plus operations and maintenance). Particularly disturbing
is that the water charges only covered 702 of operating and maintenance
costs,  and hence none of amortisation in that year.   Two issues are
highlighted by this poor performance of cost recovery. First, when the
area to be improved was reduced during the investment phase without a
cutback in project costs, a smaller tax base was available  for cost
recovery. Second, salaries and other operations costs rose to much higher
levels than' originally projected.   Staffing at Lampsar grew to over 60
people at its peak, although personnel cuts have brought the level down to
about 40.               f
5.18      The current water fee can also be compared to the per hectare
costs of providing irrigation. This cost definition includes amortisation
of medium-term investment costs (pumps, pump stations, electrical
equipment), energy costs, personnel and maintenance, but excludes long-term
capital costs of land levelling and canal construction. It thus represents
water costs that must be covered if production is to be sustained over the
estimated life of the project.  Table 5 shows rough estimates that this
cost of delivering water to the irrigation system in 1985 was about CFA
91,C00 per hectare at Lampsar and CPA 75,000 per hectare at Debi.  The
higher costs at Lampsar is due to the additional pubmping costs from the



- 24 -
Senegal River into Lampsar Marigot at Ronq Station, and to high
amortsation costs of the thirteen pump stations. The current water fee
thus only covers between 45Z and 552 of water delivery costs.
5.19      With double cropping, total water fees collected will increase
and improve the situation somewhat. At a cropping intensity of 1502, all
of current operation and maintenance costs will be covered, and if these
can be reduced further as is envisaged, some capital costs can be financed
as well. However, faster depreciation of equipment would also have to be
accounted for.
Expatriate Consultants
5.20      In  addition  to  the  five  technical  assistants  described  in
para 5.04, consultants were also responsible for the detailed designs of
the irrigation network, for supervision of works, soil testing, and the
studies  to assess  future  lrrigation projecta.  Despite  the antecedent
friction over the use of expatriate consultants, the firms eventually
engaged were able to establish good working relations with SAED, and
completed their contracts satisfactorily.
Accounting, Audits, and Progress Reports
5.21      The loan agreement provided that (i) separate accounts would be
kept for each perimeter of the project, broken down by expenditure category
and fund source; (ii) revised accounts of SAED for each financial exercise,
along with an independent auditor's report, would be provided to the World
Bank within six months; (iii) monitoring reports on physical works and
agricultural progress would be made available trimesterly and annually; and
(iv) semi-annual reports on the applied research program would be made.
5.22      To assist SAED develop an operational accounting system,  the
project provided for a technical consultant who would report directly to
the General Director. Several years into the project, this objective still
faced enormous difficulties, beginning with the absence of a formal budget
and adequate government financing of the operational budget. Thus despite
technical assistance SAID was unable in this initial period to present
adequate project accounts, let alone independent audits. The situation has
improved considerably. SAED now computerizes all project investment costs
by category and source of funds; this was done retrospectively for Debi and
Lampsar. An independent audit accepted by the World Bank in 1984 found
some minor miscategorisation of investment expenditure under the project,
but no other irregularities. However, accounting procedures for recurrent
budget expenditures at the project level were and remain inadequate.
Accounts are not systematically kept, and vary in completeness from year to
year. Recurrent costs for the project perimeters prior to 1983 are only
partially available.

5.23      Monitoring of physical works and agricultural progress did not
occur trimesterly, but was adequate and improved over the project period.
There was ongoing surveillance of yields, input use, crop loss, and credit
repayment. Spot checks of maintenance needs and water use and costs were
conducted, with the latter currently being systematically appraised. SAED
also completed a project completion report, including the results of a
simple but useful socio-economic survey.
VI. SPECIAL ISSUES
Economic Viability of Rice Production In the Delta
6.01      The  negative  rates  of  return  to  the  project,  even  under
optimistic assumptions about future production intensity and exchange
ratas, puts emphasis on several aspects of future irrigation investments.
First is the need to establish viable rotations on such perimeters that
include higher valued crops. Rice monoculture, even with doubla cropping,
does not justify the investment costs. Risk and consumption considerations
will continue to keep rice at the center of any crop rotation, but other
crops must be introduced. If tomatoes are the choice, particular attention
to avoiding the problems with this crop at Lampsar is critical.
6.02      Reducing investment costs is another avenue for improving the
viability of such projects. Options here will be clearer in two or three
more years, since experience with different scale and technology irrigation
perimeters along the Senegal River is still very recent. First impressions
are not encouraging that simpler investments are a solution however; small
village perimeters appear to trade lower investment costs for high
maintenance costs and short life span. This trade off was made with the
technical designs at Debi and Lampsar.  Attempts to reduce investments
costs through eliminating water gates in the main canals required
compensating with canals having higher embankments and a gentler slope.
The additional earth moving required was minimized to hold down costs; as a
consequence numerous breaks in the irrigation canals have occurred.
6.03      One avinue for decreasing irrigation investment costs depends on
crop diversification. A design for only rice must be able to meet high
peak water requirements, both in pumiint and canal capacity.  A mix of
crops includes different vegatative cycles and timing of water needs, and
for the same area cultivated, can reduce peak water capacity in comparison
to an all rice system. The scale of pumps and canals can therefore be
scaled down.
6.04      Provisions also need to be made in project design on contract
specification to allow cutting back on some investment costs if the area to
be irrigated is scaled back.   For example at Lampsar,  despite a 20%
reduction in area actually irrigated, the originally designed pump capacity
was still installed.
6.05      Irrigation system peak-demand capacity and. costs could also be
reduced if water was pumped continuously rather than the current practice
of only day-time pumping. The constraint here is apparently one of farmers
being unwilling to receive water for their fields at nig.*.

6.06      Additional cost savings may be possible through use of immersible
pumps rather than the vertical axe, helix pumps actually used at Lampsar.
The latter require much more substantial housing to provide a cool ambient
temperature and for a dust free environment. Low water levels and a hot
climate coincide to reduce the pumping efficiency of the helix pumps, a
shortcoming that will be accentuated during the dry season if double
cropping is practiced. Immersible pumps do not have these drawbacks and
may be an option with lower investment requirements and operational costs.
User Charnes and Cost Recovery
6.07      The poor performance on project cost recovery through water fees
has put pressure on SAED to Increase these user charges (para. 5.16 -
5.10). The financial analysis of farm revenues (paras. 3.17 - 3.19) showed
that for larger farmers, net returns we-re sufficient to permit raising
water fees and still maintain adequate financial incentives.  This is not
true for small farmers, where with current water charges, and taking into
account autoconsumption, net cash flow is negative for rice productior.
The diversity of farm size thus makes it difficult to apply an equal
increase in users fees throughout the project area.
6.08      For  future  evaluations  of  appropriate  water  fees,  further
information should be sought to verify several assumptions underlying the
above argument.  First, a shift to double cr"nping would ease the financial
constraint on higher user fees for smaller farmers. For instance, for a
farmer who double cropped a 0.7 ha plot, a doubling of the current water
fee would still leave a net cash income per manday of over 1000, in
addition  to allowing  autoconsumption  needs  to be met.   Second,  more
accurate information on farm size distribution is needed, to determine what
proportion of farmers are vulnerable to higher user fees. An associated
factor is the correlation between farm and family size. The assumption
that family size and hence autocon umption needs, are constant across
different farm sizes may not be true.  If  families dependent on small
farms are smaller, there is less of a constraint on higher user fees.
Finally, sources of non-paddy income are an important consideration, but
have received very little attention. SAED survey results show that Lampsar
families are engaged in non-paddy farm activities. Dry-land field crops of
some sort are planted by 97Z of the families, vegetable crops by 632, while
83Z possessed cattle. Only 18Z of the families report cash income from
vegetables, 32 from cattle, and 6% from other sources, however, and the
value of this non-paddy cash income was not determined. To the extent such
income exists, the justification is reduced for measuring financial
incent-ives for paddy production by subtracting the full cost of
autoconsumption from paddy output value alone. This approach overstates
the constraints on raising users fees.
6.09      In  short,  evaluation  of  appropriate  water  fees  requires  a
financial analysis that is sensitive to the social context of paddy
production. Farm size and family size distribution, outside sources of
income, and the extent of double cropping are all directly relevant
factors, whose consideration may suggest a more flexible fee structure than
the current pan-delta flat fee per hectare.

Mechanisation
6.10      The appropriate degree of mechanisation remains an unresolved
issue. Two operations were foreseen at appraisal to be best carried out
with mechanical implements - land preparation and threshing of paddy.
Mechanical threshing has all but been adandoned in favor of manual
threshing.   Tractor  use  for  land  preparation  is  passing  through  a
transition stage as SAED and villagers seek new institutional arrangements
for provision tractor services in anticipation of SAED's withdrawal from
this activity. Past experience with mechanisation in the project is only a
murky guide to the future, since the advent of double cropping will put new
time constraints on the crop calendar.
6.11      The  project  credit  financed  US  $0.5  million  of mechanical
threshers, equivalent to a third of all project agricultural machinery
costs. Several different designs of threshers all proved to be impractical
because of farmers' practice at harvest of stacking bundles of paddy at
several spots in a parcel. Attempts to encourage farmers to transport the
stalk paddy to central threshing floors were unsuccessful. So too was the
recourse to moving the threshers from pile to pile in the fields, since a
tractor was needed, time to move and level the apparatus was costly, and
soil compacting and damage to earthworks was accentuated. The purchased
threshers are idle, replaced by manual threshing.
6.12      With double cropping, the period betuieen harvesting the hot dry
season crop and planting the main season crop will be quite short. Delays
in clearing the fields of the first harvest and preparing for the second
crop could cause reduced main trop yields because of late planting. Close
monitoring will be required to see whether hired labor markets will develop
adequately for this period, which is problematic since the period is one of
intense land preparation is the groundnut basin whence much of the migrant
labor originates. But a hasty new investment in threshing equipment is
ill-advised unless labor markets are shown to be inadequate, and solutions
are found to the placement and manugerial problems.
6.13      Tractor use for land preparation has been almost universal in the
project area, but faces a difficult transitional period as SAED's
disengagement shifts managerial responsibility to farmer cooperatives and
private-service  providers.   The  ability  of  these  latter  to maintain
tractors in good repair and to meet peak seasonal demand is unproven.
Private tractor-hire service are at present limited to the tomato canning
plants, who will clearly service tomato growers before paddy farmers.
Farmer machinery cooperatives (Section d'Utilisation du Materiel Agricole -
SUHA) are being organized on an experimental basis at several perimeters in
the Delta and have received small tractors and training. Tractorisation
remains the main thrust of land preparation in Debi-Lampsar, with
relatively little being done to experiment with or promote animal traction,
no-till planting, and powered hand tillers for flooded parcels.

c/   Current values for 1979-85 have been adjusted using the MUV deflator so they are
stated in constant 1986 terms. Local content portions of each cost are multiplied by
the standard conversion factor of 0.72. Since realised local costs could not be
determined, the appraisal report's estimates of local currency costs was used.
Lampsar: irrigation earthworks, land levelling, irrigation civil works, pumps,
electric line, maintenance equipment, vehicules -- 15Z; roads and dikes, service
buildings, agricultural machinery, office equipment -- 25S; supervision - 101. Debi:
pumps, maintenance equipment, vehicules -- 15Z; irrigation earthworks, land levelling,
service buildings, agricultural machinery, office equipment -- 25Z; supervision --
101. Salaries -- 1002; Operational maintenance -- 251.
d/   Total does not include agricultural machinery, pump equipment, or pump station costs
(71Z of irrigation buildings and structures), since these costs, converted to an
amortisation stream, are incorporated into mechanical labor and irrigation costs in
the production costs section.
e/   1401 of output paddy value, to account for costs of selecting seed from own
production.
f/   This is SAED's estimate of average economic costs of mechanical land preparation and
includes fuel, lubricants, amortisation and maintenance.

DEBI-LAMSAR IRRIGATION PROJECT
( (Credit 775-SE)
PROJECT COMPLETION REPORT
ANNEX IV: Key Assumptions Used in Rate of Return Analysis
t.        Appraisal:  10% over 50 years (1978-2127)
A.   Benefits
1.   Incremental production consisting of paddy and tomatoes at
Lampsar, and paddy only at Debi. At Lampsar, paddy area at
full development was based on single-cropping of 1,880 ha
with an additional 340 ha tomatoes. Debi area was appraised
at  1,100 ha  for  paddy.   Yields  were  to  progress  to
3.5 ton/ha for paddy and 30 ton/ha for tomatoes over a
period of four years.
B.   Costs
1.   All project  costs,  except  those  incurred  for  technical
assistance to SAED, applied research, and general studies.
2.   Operating and maintenance costs on irrigation schemes.
3.   Incremental agricultural inputs, including labor evaluated
at an overall, marginal opportunity cost of 110 CFA/manday.
II.       Re-Evaluation:  -42 over 25 years (1979-2003)
The shorter period is used since it corresponds more closely with
SAED's depreciation schedule for irrigation works, and with recent
World Bank appraisals of irrigation projects. All costs and benefits
are in 1986 terms, with earlier years current values adjusted using
the GDP deflator. Future prices of paddy, fertilizer, other chemical
inputs and exchange rates vary based on World Bank forecasts.
A.   Benefits
1.   No benefits from tomatoes are considered since this crop is
not cultivated on the irrigated perimeters.
2.   Benefits derive from incremental production of paddy, and
from hay fodder. The value of the latter, which can vary
considerably depending on rainfall's impact on dryland
pasture, is simply evaluated at 5X of paddy value.
3.   Land available reaches 2,000 ha per season at Lampsar and
733 ha per season at Debi.  In 1989, when Manantali Dam
becomes operational, double cropping becomes possible.
Social and technical constraints ar' projected initially to
limit the second season crop to 60 of the area of the main
crop.

4.   Yield  projections  are  debatable  because  of  opposing
foreseeable  influences.   For the initial rate of return
calculation, yields are assumed to drop 10 from the 1980-86
average in 1987 and continue at this depressed level for a
transition period of three years after SAED disengagement
from production activities. Subsequently yields increase 32
a year as farmers improve their techniques.
B.   Costs
1.   All project  costs,  except  those  incurred  for  technical
assistance to SAED, applied research, and general studies.
In addition, lump investment costs for agricultural and
maintenance machinery and pumps occur periodically rather
than  just  at  the  project  beginning.   Reinvestment  is
considered to occur every 8 years for these medium-term
assets. This duration is fairly arbitrary. Actual usage
surpasses SAED'* 5 year accounting depreciation schedule, as
well as technical specifications. Tractor reinvestment is
included despite SAED disengagement since such mechanization
renewal will most likely remain as an economic cost borne
directly by farmers or tractor-hire services.
2.   Operating and maintenance costs.
3.   Incremental agricultural inputs, including water, mechanical
land preparation and manual labor. The latter is evaluated
at the market costs of hired labor for threshing and
harvesting, plus a reservation (subsistence) wage of
150 CFA/day for family labor that is used for the remaining
cultural operations.  The opportunity costs of labor per
hectare of paddy, calculated on the basis of a 4.5 ton
yield, is 50,550 CFA.
