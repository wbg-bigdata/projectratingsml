1.     Country and Sector Background: The tsunami of December 26, 2004, resulting from an
earthquake measuring 9.0 on the Richter scale off the island of Sumatra, caused severe damage
to coastal areas of several countries including India, Sri Lanka, Thailand, Indonesia and the
Maldives. In India, it caused extensive damage along a 2,260 km stretch of coastline in Andhra
Pradesh, Tamil Nadu, Union Territory (UT) of Pondicherry1 and Kerala, as well as in Andaman
& Nicobar Islands. The tidal waves that struck the mainland were 3 to 10 m in height and
penetrated from 300 m to 3 km inland. According to Government reports 10,881 people in India
lost their lives, 5,792 persons were reported missing, and 6,913 were injured.
2.    Overall damage and losses in Andhra Pradesh, Tamil Nadu, Puducherry, and Kerala were
estimated at US$1 billion. The main brunt was borne by the fisheries (US$568 million) and
housing (US$229 million) sectors. Damage to productive assets of fishing communities in Tamil
Nadu and Puducherry were assessed at US$264 million, of which US$190.8 million were
damages to boats and gears, and US$73.5 million to infrastructure and services. Tamil Nadu
suffered the worst in term of damage to housing, which was estimated at US$165 million.
3.    An estimated 2.7 million people were affected by the disaster. The majority was from
fishing communities (80%), the remainder worked in agriculture (15%), and small and micro
enterprises (5%). The impact had accentuated the vulnerability of coastal communities, and
exposed a number of issues that could affect their recovery, such as the complexities of
implementing the Coastal Regulation Zone (CRZ) Notification, the absence of titles as a basis
for tenure security, and the continuing decline in fishing industry that had begun before the
tsunami.
4. Reconstruction Needs and Government Response: In response to the crisis, Governments at
all levels had generally acted quickly and effectively. People were accommodated in temporary
shelters, and various forms of humanitarian relief were provided. These included a wide range of
relief packages (food, clothing, etc.), shelter provision in 200 relief camps and temporary
housing, financial assistance for personal needs, and health and psychological services.
Additional assistance was provided by a number of other organizations such as UNICEF, non-
governmental organizations (NGOs), and the private sector.
5.    While the Government of India (GoI) and state/UT Governments had undertaken effective
relief measures, the estimated short and medium term reconstruction needs exceeded the
immediate financing capacity of the respective Governments. To fill the gap, the GoI requested
assistance from the World Bank; Asian Development Bank (ADB); and the United Nations
(UN), including International Fund for Agricultural Development (IFAD), for its post-tsunami
recovery program, which encompassed livelihood support, micro-enterprises, housing, roads,
ports, health, education, environment, and coastal protection and risk mitigation. Based on

    The name Pondicherry was changed to Puducherry in 2006.




                                                       1
discussions among the three institutions and the GoI, an approach for providing reconstruction
assistance in the different sectors was developed.
6. Rationale for Bank assistance: The Bank had broad international and India-specific
emergency recovery experience in earthquake reconstruction in Gujarat and Maharashtra;
Andhra Pradesh cyclone recovery; earthquake reconstruction in Turkey; El Nino flood
reconstruction assistance in Argentina, Bolivia, Guyana and Peru; post-flood recovery in
Cambodia and China, hurricane recovery assistance in the Dominican Republic and Grenada and
other countries. This work had invariably been done in collaboration with other international and
national agencies as well as NGOs. Thus, it was in a unique position to assist the GoI and the
Government of Tamil Nadu (GoTN) and the Government of Puducherry (GoPy) with the
reconstruction program.
7.    The project envisioned to contribute to two of the three pillars of the Country Assistance
Strategy (CAS) of September 15, 2004. First, it would support improvement of Government
effectiveness through improved service delivery to the affected coastal communities and their
extensive involvement in the implementation of the project. Second, it would support the
development of rural livelihoods (the second CAS pillar) by contributing to the recovery of
fisheries, agriculture and animal husbandry infrastructure, and identification of possible
alternative livelihood opportunities for the coastal communities.
1.2 Original Project Development Objectives (PDO) and Key Indicators (as approved)
8.    The main objective of the project was to support the efforts of the Governments of India,
Tamil Nadu and Puducherry to revive livelihoods and promote recovery in the tsunami-affected
areas. Key indicators were:
    Percentage of beneficiaries living in the reconstructed housing units
    Number of boats using reconstructed harbors
    Extent of the use of reconstructed animal husbandry infrastructure by farmers relative to pre-
     tsunami period
    Share of restored agricultural land used by farmers
    Average income of project beneficiaries relatives to its pre-tsunami level
    Share of reconstructed public buildings used by the coastal communities/Government
    Number of trained masons working on post-tsunami reconstruction
    Number of property titles issued to the beneficiaries
    Number of people who have undertaken alternative livelihood opportunities as a result of
     training under the project
1.3 Revised PDO and Key Indicators, and reasons/justification
9.    Within two years of project implementation, it became clear that the project would
accumulate significant cost savings primarily on account of: (a) overestimation of housing
reconstruction needs which was based on the initial damage assessment, and (b) replacement of
IDA project funds with other grant assistance, mainly from NGOs and the private sector.
Therefore, in 2007, the GoI/GoTN requested the utilization of these savings for an integrated
disaster risk reduction program for highly vulnerable communities in coastal Tamil Nadu. A first
order restructuring of the project was approved by the Board on July 17, 2009, and made
effective on August 13, 2009.


                                                 2
10.   Revised PDO: To revive livelihoods and promote recovery in the tsunami-affected areas in
the short-term and to reduce the vulnerability of coastal communities to a range of natural
hazards such as cyclone, storm surge, flood, and tsunami over the longer term. Revised key
indicators were:
     Percentage of communities/homeowners (also beyond project beneficiaries) sensitized and
      willing to reconstruct their houses to disaster resistant standards
     Percentage of communities that participated in awareness programs on early warning
      systems.
     Reduced distance and traveling time to evacuation shelters to percentage of communities
     Percentage of fully functional and community-owned evacuation shelters
     Overall no. and percentage of houses completed to disaster resistant standards
     Percentage of Districts which substantially complete reconstruction
     Total and percentage amount (of original estimate) disbursed to contractors
     Number of early warning systems (VHF and Public Address Systems) installed
     Percentage increase in coverage of early warning systems
     Number of evacuation shelters constructed
     Number of spot improvement projects implemented
     Kilometers of roads constructed or reconstructed/rehabilitated
     Number of bridges/culverts reconstructed/rehabilitated

1.4 Main Beneficiaries
11.    The expected beneficiaries of the restructured project included:
     People whose houses were destroyed or damaged by tsunami (Tamil Nadu & Puducherry),
      and those living in vulnerable houses (Tamil Nadu).
     Tsunami-affected families who depended for their livelihoods on fisheries, agriculture,
      horticulture, and animal husbandry.
     Coastal communities who did not have access to evacuation shelters and early warning
      systems in Tamil Nadu.
1.5 Original Components (as approved)
12.    The project consisted of the following five components:
13.   Component 1: Housing Reconstruction (US$596.8 million). This component consisted
of three sub-components: (a) provision of transit shelter as needed; and upgrading of services in
temporary shelter sites; (b) repair and reconstruction of existing houses, construction of new
houses, and the necessary related services and community infrastructure; and (c) resettlement of
families affected by the project.
14.   Component 2: Restoration of Livelihoods (US$36.4 million). The assistance to fisheries
included: (a) restoration of damaged fisheries infrastructure, such as harbors, patrol boats,
clearing bar mouth and estuaries to maintain estuarine habitats, and aquaculture infrastructure;
and (b) reestablishment of safety-at-sea systems/services; and assistance to agriculture,
horticulture and livestock; and (c) promotion of sustainable management of coastal land and
water resources.


                                                  3
15.   Component 3: Public Buildings and Public Works (US$19.5 million). This component
provided financing for small public works such as repair, reconstruction and upgrading of
damaged hospitals, public health centers/sub-centers, educational institutions, cyclone shelters
and other public buildings, restoration of damaged river and drain banks, and
plantation/replanting of mangroves and shelter belts in Tamil Nadu.
16.   Component 4: Technical Assistance and Training (US$111 million). This component
financed: (a) technical assistance and capacity building for housing reconstruction; (b)
preparation of social and environmental management plans in accordance with ESMF; (c)
community participation efforts to ensure involvement of the affected communities; (d) studies
to assess the vulnerabilities and longer term issues associated with coastal zone protection;
environmental studies on coastal water quality, ground water quality, pollution of tidal
influenced water bodies in urban areas and capacity building among various stake holders and
hazard risk management.
17.   Component 5: Implementation Support (US$19.0 million). This component financed the
project management and incremental operating costs such as: (a) quality assurance and technical
audits to ensure adequate quality of reconstruction works; (b) project monitoring and evaluation
(M&E), including continuous social and environmental impact assessments as outlined in ESMF;
(c) project management and incremental operating cost; and (d) project audits.
1.6 Revised Components
18.   Tamil Nadu: At the time of the first restructuring, a new component, Vulnerability
Reduction of Coastal Communities (VRCC), was added and financed from the accumulated
savings. This component, with an estimated cost of US$136.4 million, included the following
activities:
     Emergency Evacuation and Early Warning Facilities (US$39.1 million) – This entailed: (a)
      construction of around 78 new evacuation shelters; (b) construction or improvement of about
      150 km of evacuation routes to improve road linkages to such shelters; and (c) installation of
      around 1,000 numbers of early warning systems including early warning towers in villages
      within 1,000 meters of the High Tide Line (HTL).
     Reconstruction of Risk-prone Houses to Multi-Disaster Resistant Standards (US$87.3
      million). This sub-component included in-situ reconstruction of about 17,000 risk-prone
      houses in the 200-1,000 meter vicinity of the HTL in the tsunami affected 11 coastal districts.
      The sub-component also included insurance for the reconstructed houses and relocation
      support to beneficiaries.
     Technical Assistance and Implementation Support (US$10.1 million). Technical assistance
      and implementation support comprised: (a) training project implementation staff in various
      project implementation activities; (b) training program for masons and other construction
      artisans in disaster resistant construction practices; and; (c) capacity building of communities
      in the execution of disaster management plans, and protocols and procedures for maintenance
      and operation of early warning systems and evacuation shelters; (d) procurement support
      consultants; (e) NGO services; (f) external procurement audits, (g) third party quality audit
      and social monitoring, and (h) design consultants for evacuation shelters and early warning
      systems.
19. Puducherry: The Agriculture sub-component under the Livelihood component was
removed from ETRP because the rehabilitation works were completed using GoPy’s own funds.

1.7 Other significant changes
20.       Project Restructuring. The project was restructured three times during implementation:
21.   First restructuring: August 2009. In addition to revising the PDO as mentioned in Section
1.3, the first restructuring involved the following changes:
          Addition of VRCC component (see Section 1.6)
          Extension of the Closing Date of the credit (see below)
          Reallocation of proceeds of the credit (see below)
22.   The first restructuring aimed at extending the project development impact by strengthening
longer-term disaster preparedness and specifically reducing the vulnerability of coastal
communities to a range of natural disasters. This marked a shift from the original response-based
approach, required under the project in the immediate aftermath of the tsunami, towards longer-
term risk reduction in the project area.
23.   Second restructuring: November 2010. The second restructuring was carried out to reduce
the credit by US$69 million because it was determined that this would not be used by the project.
The cancellation consisted of US$67.6 million from Tamil Nadu and US$1.4 million from
Puducherry.
24. Third restructuring: December 2011. In the third restructuring, the Bank cancelled an
amount of US$235.0 million because the closing date of the project was not extended beyond
December 31, 2011, and consequently the available credit would remain unutilized.
25.  Funding allocations. During implementation, the Credit Agreement was revised three
times to reallocate funds:
26.  The first reallocation of funds was done as part of the first restructuring. The major
changes were: (a) reducing funding amount for housing reconstruction in Tamil Nadu from
US$423.0 million to US$201.9 million; and (b) adding US$136.4 million to the new VRCC
component. Furthermore, there were minor reallocations among subcomponents.
27. The second reallocation was done as part of the second restructuring, involved reallocation
among subcomponents following the cancellation of US$69.0 million.
28. The third reallocation was done at the time of third restructuring, involved reallocation
among subcomponents because of the cancellation of US$235.0 million.
29.   Project Schedule. Originally, the project was scheduled to close on April 30, 2008.
Subsequently, the project was extended a few times to accommodate the restructuring process
and then the first restructuring extended the closing date to December 31, 2011.

2. Key Factors Affecting Implementation and Outcomes
2.1 Project Preparation, Design and Quality at Entry
30.  Project background. At the request of the GoI, the Bank agreed to finance this emergency
reconstruction project mainly through a redeployment of savings from 15 IDA-financed projects
involving a total of US$410 million, supplemented by a further US$55 million as new IDA
resources. The US$465 million was to finance critical reconstruction investments in Tamil Nadu
and Puducherry, which suffered most severely from effects of the tsunami.

                                                   5
31.   Assessment of quality at entry. This project was formulated in response to an extraordinary
natural calamity and hence did not have the benefit of a full-fledged project preparation. The
design was based on the prevailing needs and on the information available at that time. However,
in the first two years of project implementation, significant funding through NGOs and private
sector was mobilized for housing reconstruction. This reduced the need for the Bank funding.
Further, housing reconstruction needs were significantly overestimated during the initial damage
assessment. This was understandable considering the post-emergency conditions.
32.   Regarding implementation arrangements, the respective roles of numerous entities at the
central, state, and district levels were clearly defined. Further, the GoTN decided that for a multi-
sectoral project it is better that implementation is carried out by the respective line departments
with the PMU playing a coordinating and facilitating role, rather than assuming all
implementation responsibilities, especially because Tamil Nadu has specialized agencies such as
the Tamil Nadu Water and Drainage Board (TWAD Board) and Tamil Nadu Slum Clearance
Board (TNSCB) which are capable of implementing project activities. In the case of Puducherry,
GoPy entrusted the implementation responsibility to a newly formed society, the Project
Implementing Agency (PIA) under a Project Director.
33.   Being an emergency project prepared as a rapid response, the project design had a few
shortcomings such as too many activities under a variety of components and an overly optimistic
implementation schedule of 36 months. Further, as mentioned subsequently in Section 2.3, M&E
design was weak because the indicators were vaguely defined.
34.   Lessons of earlier operations taken into account. The experience of previous disaster
management operations in India, particularly the Andhra Pradesh Hazard Mitigation and
Emergency Cyclone Recovery Project and the Emergency Earthquake Reconstruction Projects in
Maharashtra and Gujarat, provided the following lessons: (a) while it is important to build in
hazard risk management systems, these need to be separated from emergency reconstruction
activities because they require a much longer implementation schedule, and (b) flexibility in
approach, high client ownership, and political commitment are essential elements for successful
implementation. These two lessons were explicitly incorporated in the original project design.
35.   Adequacy of Government commitment. At the time of project preparation, the
Governments at all levels – the GoI, GoTN, GoPy and at district levels - acted quickly and
effectively in terms of providing humanitarian relief and immediate assistance. At the national
level, the Ministry of Home Affairs was designated as the nodal agency for coordinating relief in
the affected states/union territories. In addition, the GoI had also constituted a high level multi-
sectoral Core Group for planning and coordinating the post-tsunami reconstruction program in
the Planning Commission. In a coordinated way, the GoI with support from the GoTN and GoPy
estimated short and medium term reconstruction needs and assessed that it exceeded the
immediate financing capacity of the respective Governments as well as that of the NGOs and
the private sector. To fill the gap, the GoI requested assistance from the World Bank, ADB and
the UN, including IFAD, for its post-tsunami recovery program, which encompassed livelihood
support, micro-enterprises, housing, roads, ports, health, education, environment, and coastal
protection and risk mitigation. Similar to the commitment demonstrated towards relief and
immediate assistance, the commitment towards tsunami reconstruction was also of a high order
across all levels of Government.



                                                 6
2.2 Implementation
A. Tamil Nadu
36.   Till the Mid-Term Review (MTR) in March 2007, GoTN had made good progress in the
Livelihood and Public Building component. All the activities initiated were to be completed by
the credit closing date. Similarly, good progress was achieved in the rural housing component
though it was not funded under the project. The implementation of the urban housing and the
fishery infrastructure components were significantly delayed. Overall, the project was marked by
low disbursement. The following factors affected project implementation.
37.  Urban housing reconstruction: This component was limited to Chennai and attempted to
provide permanent housing to tsunami-affected families. Urban housing had its own share of
complications and was significantly delayed. Several contributing factors are as follows:
     Identification of suitable land and finalization of beneficiary lists was a challenge due to
      scarcity of appropriate land and sensitivities related to relocation, i.e. work-home location
      relationship.
     Vacating houses by the beneficiaries including on account of the demand for additional
      house for each household. (Marina – Nochi Kuppam). Beneficiaries were apprehensive of
      Government’s intention in spite of a very rigorous and objective beneficiary selection and
      validation process, which used biometric method of identification. Several beneficiaries also
      demanded additional houses as they had extended families even though GoTN had a policy
      of one new house for one old house.
     Environmental litigation associated with a wetland adjoining a relocation site (Okkiyum-
      Thuraipakkam) that took over 18 months for resolution in favor of the GoTN.
     Delays in start of work due to delay in moving to temporary shelters (AIR) by the
      beneficiaries and further delays in execution of works by contractors (AIR and Marina)
     Co-ordination issues between the TNSCB and other Government agencies such as
      CMWSSB, Chennai Corporation and Electricity Board in ensuring water supply, sewerage
      and electrical connections respectively (Marina, Semmancheri and AIR)
     Delay in the construction of transit shelters due to (a) the delay in Chennai Municipal
      Corporation making available one of the large sites; and (b) the need for the court’s
      permission for use of reserved Open Spaces for transit housing.
     Preparation and distribution of bio-metric cards.
38.    Fisheries and Livelihoods: The capacity of the Department of Fisheries was relatively
weak. Building their capacity and getting them to plan, design and execute rehabilitation
initiatives in line with the Bank procedures and requirements turned out to be a significantly
longer process than what was envisaged. In addition, implementation of fishery infrastructure
works was affected by the delays in obtaining statutory environmental clearances and transfer of
lands.
39.   Restructuring: The process that started in late 2007 took about two years to become
effective. This was because different approaches in implementing the VRCC component were
debated. The pros and cons of beneficiary-driven housing construction vis-à-vis the regular
contractor-driven approach were considered. Output-based aid/disbursement instead of the
conventional contracting approach of claims-based disbursements was also analyzed. Following
discussions, agreement was reached that contractor-driven, claim-based disbursement approach


                                                  7
would be used for housing reconstruction. Thereafter, GoTN requested that certain procurement-
related conditions to be modified primarily the relaxation of post qualification criteria for the
bidders. Considerable amount of time was taken in reaching agreements on the approach and
procurement modifications.
40.   Rural housing: Simultaneous implementation of GoTN-sponsored housing schemes
contributed to a general scarcity of building materials such as brick, sand, and stones across all
districts. In addition, contractor capacities were stretched. This led to delay in contract awards
and slowing down the construction.
41.   PMU: The project involved 13 different implementing agencies most of whom were not
familiar with implementation processes of Bank-funded projects. Thus there was a need to have
a strong coordinating PMU. However, due to the lack of adequate human resources in the PMU,
implementation was adversely affected. Lack of an effective management information system
was also a key contributing factor.
42.   Procurement: The major problem in procurement was the frequent rebidding by almost all
project implementing agencies (TWAD Board, TNSCB, Rural Development Department,
Department of Environment, Fisheries Department) on account of either receiving no bids or due
to non responsive bids. Large number of small works spread across a vast area that required a
huge pool of contractors that exacerbated the problem. Standard qualification criteria for the
bidders further restricted the number of eligible contractors. While qualification criteria were
subsequently relaxed for many subprojects, this happened on a case-to-case basis and involved
significant time. In addition, weak procurement capacity in the implementing agencies often led
to delays in decision-making leading to the requirement of extending bid and performance
security validities. At times, the bidders refused to accept such extensions leading to further
rebiddings causing further delays.
43.   Other issues: Periodic elections also resulted in implementation delays. The project was
implemented during two state elections (both resulted in a change of administration in Tamil
Nadu), one national election, and two local Government elections. During each of these
elections, about four months of implementation was lost.
B. Puducherry
44.   At the time of the MTR, in the case of Puducherry as well, housing reconstruction was
being done through NGO grant funds and not using ETRP funds. However, GoPy intended to
use ETRP funds for selected housing reconstruction but progress was not made due to delay in
finalizing the relocation sites and related land acquisition. No progress was made with fishery
infrastructure as well.
45.    The following factors affected project implementation:
     While there were two major components – Housing and Livelihoods, the focus of the
      PIA/GoPy was on housing. This was because the GoI was giving much more focus and
      importance to housing rehabilitation and pursuing with respective state/UT Governments vis-
      à-vis reporting action/follow-up. In retrospect, the absence of focus on the Livelihoods
      component in the early stages resulted in works being incomplete even after six years of
      project implementation.
     GoPy established the PIA under this project as a special organization/unit to hasten the
      implementation of the rehabilitation works. For GoPy, this was the very first instance of

                                                 8
      implementing an externally aided project. The Bank procedures, particularly those related to
      procurement, and statutory clearances were completely new to the PIA. Building internal
      capacity and effecting implementation in line with these requirements caused delays.
     GoPy did not assign a full time Project Director to the PIA. This position was always given
      as additional job/responsibility to an officer who was holding some other fulltime
      assignment. All staff in the PIA was on deputation / secondment from other departments, and
      constantly changed during the project period. All of these staffing reasons contributed
      towards implementation delays.
     The quality of consultants and contractors was a factor that caused implementation delays. In
      the housing component, the contractor delayed activities for more than one year. In the
      fisheries component, the quality of the service consultants’ outputs was not commensurate
      with the requirements. The PIA did not have adequate monitoring capacity to manage
      multiple service consultants. This necessitated the appointment of a Project Management
      Consultant to oversee the service consultants. Having several consultants for the design and
      to support implementation resulted in coordination lapses.
     Due to non-availability of land and changes in sites for the various fishery infrastructure
      works, there were delays in planning and required consultants to re-work designs.
     In the beneficiary-driven housing component, there were delays in the GoPy issuing land
      titles.
2.3 Monitoring and Evaluation (M&E) Design, Implementation and Utilization
46.   The project’s Outcome and Output Indicators were vaguely defined and did not have
specific targets for these indicators. In addition, baseline values were not available. A basic web-
enabled Management Information System (MIS) was put in place only towards the end of the
project, i.e. in January 2011. Using this MIS, outcome-based indicators were developed. On
approval of the framework by the various departments, the data collection was initiated but the
credit closed before that could be completed.
47.  Though a formal M&E framework and tool was not in place, regular progress monitoring
was being done at the PMU through review meetings. Decisions were taken in the meetings to
enhance implementation progress but effective follow-up action was not taken.
2.4 Safeguard and Fiduciary Compliance
A. Environmental Safeguards
48.   Tamil Nadu: The environmental safeguards management in the project was guided by an
‘Environment and Social Management Framework (ESMF)’developed during the preparation
phase of the project. The ESMF was subsequently updated during project restructuring by
suitably incorporating the VRCC component. The implementation of ESMF was monitored by
Environmental and Social Specialists at the PMU. The key achievements of the project with
regard to environmental safeguards were: (a) preparation of Environmental Assessment (EA)
Reports for sub-projects in full compliance with the safeguard policies of the Bank as well as
statutory requirements; (b) integration of respective Environmental Management Plans (EMP) in
the contract documents; (c) securing coastal regulatory zone clearances for urban housing, rural
housing, and other livelihood support activities prior to the implementation; (d) obtaining
statutory clearances such as EIA clearances and consent-to-establish, and (e) regular monitoring
of the implementation of safeguard activities.

                                                  9
49.   In addition to the above, the project also implemented a few innovative activities such as:
(a) development of decentralized sanitation facilities through technologies such as: Decentralized
Waste Water Systems (DEWATS), Intermittent Sand Filter (ISF); and Moving Bed Reactor
(MBR) to the coastal communities; (b) provision of wastewater treatment and solid waste
management facilities in all the fishery sub-projects; and (c) incorporation of biomedical waste
management facilities in the Nagapattinam Hospital and other places. The project implementing
agencies with the help of the Bank’s Task Team carried out safeguard orientation programs,
which resulted in effective safeguard management in the project and also a better understanding
of environmental management while implementing the projects in coastal areas.
50.   Despite all these good initiatives, the project had safeguard issues related to construction
safety and management, the lack of basic facilities in the urban housing sub-project sites, and
delays in the preparation of environmental assessment reports for sub-projects.
51.   Puducherry: For the PIA in Puducherry, adherence to environmental safeguard
requirements was quite a challenge. Even though the Bank's requirements were only what GoI
required, the PIA was not familiar with the processes and the various documents that were
needed to obtain the various GoI clearances. Substantive support from the Bank's Task Team and
the consultants was required. While all of these clearances were obtained, there were
considerable delays particularly in the various fishery infrastructure works.
B. Social Safeguards
52.   Land acquisition. A large amount of land was successfully acquired on a timely basis for
establishment of rehabilitation sites for tsunami-affected people. A total of 560 ha of land,
including 330 ha of private land, was acquired (about 20 ha were purchased by the NGOs). Some
of the land (about 40 ha) was also donated by local citizens. The remaining lands either belonged
to the Government or to Temples Trusts. The land acquisition was done in a relatively short
period of time by adopting a private negotiation process. Under this process, a special
Government Order was issued to allow the District Collectors to decide the compensation rates
up to 200% of the Guideline values or registered values. The GoTN paid attention to minimizing
the land acquisition impacts by searching for available Government lands and also selecting only
unproductive private lands to minimize the adverse impacts on the land owners. However, only
the funds of the State Government and not that of World Bank were used for this purpose.
53.   Retrofit measures for displaced families in Nagapattinam District. There was a delay in
the implementation of R&R policy provisions for displaced families in Nagapattinam district due
to the improvement to the North Buckingham canal. The local authorities demolished the
affected structures without offering compensation and assistance. However, after this problem
came to the attention of the Bank team, GoTN prepared retrofit measures and implemented the
same. All six displaced families, were offered cash grants to compensate for the impacts suffered
by them. At the time of credit closing, five families received the cash grant and GoTN is in the
process of paying the grant to the remaining one family.
54.   Resettlement of Host population in urban housing schemes. Some host populations,
about 100 families, were affected at two resettlement sites. In the case of one of the sites
(Okkiyum-Thuraipakkam), all 29 host families were resettled temporarily in a nearby TNSCB
houses and they will be shifted to the permanent site when the new houses are ready for
allotment. In the case of other sites (AIR site in North Chennai), 60 out of 70 families have
already shifted by the closing date and the remaining families will be shifted shortly.

C. Fiduciary issues
Tamil Nadu:
55.   The procurement and financial management rating for the project remained marginally
satisfactory to marginally unsatisfactory during several ISRs.
56.    Procurement: Contributing factors were delays in procurement primarily due to poor or, at
times, no response to the bid invitations. Weak procurement capacities in implementing
agencies, lack of eligible and interested bidders, scattered nature of work, etc. added to the
problem. With 13 implementing agencies carrying out procurement in a decentralized manner,
the oversight from PMU was critical. While PMU for most of the time had one procurement
specialist, no support staff was available to assist. In addition, absence of an effective MIS made
it difficult to track various issues such as bid validities, performance security validities, etc.
Several lapses in procurement procedures kept cropping-up and these had to be then managed
involving prolonged communication between the Bank and PMU. At times, rebidding was
initiated. TWAD Board in particular handled procurement ineffectively and took inordinately
long time for completion. Another factor that kept plaguing the procurement was the perceived
higher bid premium, as the estimates were not regularly updated, market factors and special
working conditions were not factored into the costing.
57.   Financial Management: Involvement of a large number of implementing agencies (13),
combined with their varied legal structures- departments, Urban Local Bodies, state para-statels
lead to a complex financial management arrangement. Implementing agencies did not accord
adequate priority to submission of Statement Of Expenditures (SOE) to the PMU, requiring
considerable follow up efforts by the PMU. However, a shift to IUFR based disbursement
following the re-structuring brought discipline in reporting by the implementing agencies to the
PMU. Even though consolidated IUFRs were submitted to the bank with some delays and
statutory audits were also delayed, the PMU diligently followed up on obtaining responses from
the implementing agencies, resolved issues and made appropriate adjustments from the
reimbursements. Audit report for the period April 2011 to June 2012 is expected to be received
by December 2012.
Puducherry:
58.   On fiduciary aspects, the PIA and GoPy were adopting the Bank's procurement policies for
the very first time. In comparison to their normal GoPy procurement, the Bank's procurement
was rather different. Not being familiar with these policies, a lot of time and effort in
understanding and adhering to these procurement requirements. The PIA capacity was built and
their adherence ensured but this was one of the factors that caused implementation delays. In
terms of financial management, the Bank's insistence on the double-entry system of book-
keeping and half-yearly audits - again, different from GoPy's regular requirements - resulted in
establishing financial management systems within the PIA that were regarded as best practice
within the GoPy.
2.5 Post-completion Operation/Next Phase
A. Tamil Nadu
59.   Transition arrangements. The transition arrangements for continuing the future operation
appear to be adequate, as demonstrated by the following measures:


                                                11
60.   Institutional. In 2005, the GoI passed the Disaster Management Act, thus paving the way
for the establishment of the National Disaster Management Authority (NDMA) at the central
level and State DMAs at the State level. In Tamil Nadu, Principal Secretary and Commissioner
of Revenue Administration, Disaster Management & Mitigation Department, acts as the Relief
Commissioner for the State. In the districts, the District Collector heads disaster response
operations, drawing upon the human and technical resources of the revenue department, police,
fire service, public works, highways, health department and other agencies including local
bodies. Overall, strong institutional arrangements exist at the state, district and sub-district level
in Tamil Nadu to respond to emergencies.
61.   Financial. Individual house owners will take care of the maintenance of their houses. In
addition, houses constructed under the VRCC component were insured against natural disasters
for ten years. In the case of community assets, these will be handed over to the respective line
departments for maintenance. Given that the state economy is fairly strong, absorbing these
incremental costs in the overall budget planning process would not be difficult.
62. For the works unfinished at credit closing, the GoTN is committed to using its own funds to
complete them, and these works remain ongoing.
B. Puducherry
63.   The project was closed prior to the completion of most of the initiated works. Thus, GoPy
will need to find the required funds to ensure completion and realize the intended development
outcomes. At the time of preparing the ICR, GoPy indicated that they will be unable to allocate
their own funds for completing these works and have approached the GoI for a follow-on project.
64.  The assets created under the Housing component are two-fold, i.e. the in-situ houses and
the houses constructed on relocated sites. While the respective beneficiaries will manage their
houses, local municipalities and cooperatives using their operation and maintenance budgets will
manage the supporting infrastructure –water supply, sanitation and facilities management.
65.   Follow-on project. Since majority of the works were not completed in Tamil Nadu and
Puducherry at the time of credit closing, discussions were underway between the GoI and the
Bank to explore the possibility of a follow-on project that would finance completion of some of
these works and new disaster risk reduction initiatives. Both GoTN and GoPy have requested the
GoI for such a follow-on project.

3. Assessment of Outcomes
3.1 Relevance of Objectives, Design and Implementation
66.   The objectives of the project are still relevant and important to India’s social and economic
development. They are also timely and appropriate to the needs of Tamil Nadu and Puducherry,
especially in terms of disaster relief measures when disasters occur, as well as in terms of
disaster preparedness. The project is also consistent with the Bank's current CAS for India (2009-
2012), which states that the Bank will assist in increasing the resilience of people and the
economy to natural and man-made shocks. Likewise, the GoI’s 11th Five-Year Plan for the
period 2007-2012 incorporated the aim of consolidating disaster preparedness, prevention, and
risk mitigation by integrating them into the development process.



                                                 12
3.2 Achievement of Project Development Objectives
67.   At the time of credit closing, many activities both in Tamil Nadu and Puducherry were
making good progress in implementation. For example, urban housing, VRCC housing and
Fisheries Infrastructure works were ongoing. However, the evacuation shelters and routes were
not tendered, and the early warning system was tendered but not awarded.
A. Tamil Nadu
68.   Moderately Unsatisfactory. As the original project objective was formally revised at the
time of first restructuring in August 2009, the project outcome in Tamil Nadu has been assessed
against both the original and revised project objectives. To assist in arriving at an overall
outcome rating, separate outcome ratings (against original and revised project objectives) were
weighted in proportion to the share of actual credit disbursements made in the periods before and
after approval of the restructuring. Based on the two ratings as shown in Annex 10, the overall
achievement of the project is rated Moderately Unsatisfactory.
A.I. Project outcome before restructuring
69.   Housing and related infrastructure to the tsunami-affected was provided through the
following:
     Ready-built houses: About 4,500 Ready Built tenements were purchased and made available
      to tsunami affected.
     Infrastructure in town panchayats: In 18 tsunami-affected town panchayats covering 57
      habitations, the infrastructure works - reconstruction of public buildings, roads, street
      lighting, and electricity connections – were completed. About 40,000 tsunami-affected
      people benefited.
     Infrastructure in municipalities: Infrastructure facilities – roads, drains, water supply
      connections and public buildings - were provided in five tsunami-affected municipalities.
     Electricity connections: In 200 tsunami-affected villages, electricity connections in houses
      and street light connections were completed.
     Repairs to damaged dwellings: This was completed in two districts.
70.    Livelihoods of tsunami-affected families were restored through the following:
     Agriculture: Forming self-help groups, various activities were completed: (a) sand cast
      agricultural lands were reclaimed, (b) agriculture machinery, equipment, and drip irrigation
      sets were supplied, (c) Planned small-scale surface water harvesting/storage structures were
      completed, (d) Training programs on livelihood restoration and public awareness were
      conducted. About 13,500 farmers benefited from these programs.
     Horticulture: About 670 ha of horticultural lands were reclaimed with the participation of
      about 170 SHGs.
     Animal Husbandry: Equipment for surgical, diagnostic, breeding, and laboratory purposes
      for treating livestock were given to Government veterinary dispensaries.
     Forestry: With community involvement, about 5,400 ha of forest shelter belts and mangroves
      were established and maintained.
71.  In the Public Buildings and Public Works component, PWD undertook the repairs and
rehabilitation of public buildings, health, veterinary and educational institutions. PWD (WRO)
also did the de-silting and strengthening of river banks in Nagapattinam District to prevent

                                                 13
inundation and drainage congestion. This contributed to saving about 4,000 metric tons of paddy
every year. And, under the Technical assistance and Training component, about 10,000 farmers
were trained on animal husbandry practices.
Rating: Moderately Satisfactory
A.II. Project outcome after restructuring
72.   Housing and related infrastructure to the tsunami-affected in Chennai was provided through
the following:
     Construction of about 3,600 tenements along with water supply and sewerage works was
      completed at the AIR site.
     Construction of the structural works was completed in the Okkiyum-Thuraipakkam site. This
      was delayed due to a legal intervention to stop work and was subsequently lifted.
     About 2,500 temporary shelters were constructed at Marina. Of these, 1,200 shelters are
      occupied by residents who have agreed for the construction of permanent tenements.
     In the Marina Reconstruction Scheme, activities were possible only in one of the two
      identified locations: (a) Nochikuppam-Nochinagar and (b) Dommingkuppam-
      Selvarajapuram. In the first location, about 600 tenements were completed in Nochinagar and
      no construction was possible in Nochikuppam due to a lack of community consensus.
73.   In addition to rural housing done using NGO or private sector funds, sanitation
infrastructure - collection systems, manholes, interceptors, pump rooms with pump sets and
treatment systems – was constructed in 47 habitations that benefitted about 37,000 people.
74.   In the Restoration of Livelihoods component, the Fisheries Department undertook the
modernization of fishing harbours, opening of selected river bar mouths, establishing fish
landing centres and installing a tube ice plant. Substantive time was taken in obtaining various
statutory clearances. But for Vellar Bar mouth and Chinnamuttom Tube Ice Plant (advanced
stage of completion), actual construction works could be started only towards the end of the
project. Linked with the Fisheries component, an 18-month project “Fisheries Management for
Sustainable Livelihoods (FIMSUL)? developed a policy framework for the future management
and use of marine fisheries in the region. This concurrent initiative implemented by the FAO
achieved its intended goals / targets.
75.  In the Vulnerability Reduction of Coastal Communities (VRCC) component, about 4,200
houses out of the planned 14,500 houses were completed. Preparation activities related to
evacuation shelters, evacuation routes and establishing early warning systems were done but
construction / execution was not started.
Rating: Moderately Unsatisfactory
B. Puducherry
76.   Under the housing reconstruction component, about 1,750 houses were planned. Out of
these, 300 houses at Nallavadu, a relocation site, was a contractor-driven construction and was at
an advanced stage of completion. Of the remaining, about 550 houses were completed so far
through beneficiary-driven approach, which has established itself as a viable alternative
particularly for in situ housing reconstruction.



                                                14
77.  In the Livelihood Restoration component, fisheries-related activities - work shelters, fish
markets, and fishing harbors – were initiated but not completed. As a result, the objective of
improving livelihood opportunities of potential beneficiaries was not achieved.
78.  Under the training component, capacity building of PIA staff was carried out. Training was
given on the Bank's procedures and requirements. Being their first exposure to the Bank,
substantive support was given to the PIA to assist in project implementation.
Rating: As indicated in Section 2.2 B, there were serious implementation delays that led to the
development outcomes not being realized. Hence, the overall outcome is rated Unsatisfactory.

3.3 Efficiency
79.    See Annex 3
3.4 Justification of Overall Outcome Rating
Rating: Moderately Unsatisfactory
80.   Tamil Nadu: As explained in Section 3.2, the project has many satisfactory achievements
to its credit. However, in light of the weighted ratings as shown in Annex 10, the outcome is
rated as Moderately Unsatisfactory.
81.  Puducherry: Considering the limited achievements of the project in Puducherry, the
outcome is rated as Unsatisfactory.
Overall outcome rating
82. Combining the ratings for Tamil Nadu and Puducherry, the overall outcome is rated as
Moderately Unsatisfactory.
3.5 Overarching Themes, Other Outcomes and Impacts
I. Poverty Impacts, Gender Aspects, and Social Development
83. Poverty Impacts. The project created a positive impact on poverty alleviation as
demonstrated by the following examples from TN:
     Even though the project was not poverty targeted, most of the beneficiaries are poor. The
      poorest were also being catered to because they received improved and tsunami-resistant
      houses, and some of them received the titles to houses as well.
     After reconstructing 70 veterinary sub-centres, rural people started livestock activities which
      have enabled them to increase their incomes.
     Because of the reclamation of soil, production of agricultural products such as mangoes,
      cashews, vegetables, flowers, bananas and other crops has increased, and consequently the
      incomes of farmers have increased.
     Under forestry, livelihoods have improved through entry point activities.
84.   Gender Aspects. New housing financed by the project is under the joint title of husband
and wife. In addition, women had representation in grievance cells, and all of the fisheries
infrastructure will cater to women because they are the ones who are mainly involved in post-
harvest activities and marketing.




                                                   15
85.    Social development. Some of the social development achievements included:
     After receiving houses with toilets, women in the fishing communities experienced a marked
      improvement in sanitation, health, and hygiene.
     Prior to the tsunami, anganwadis for children were functioning from thatched huts; now
      many are in concrete buildings with better facilities. With increased space and facilities, the
      number of daily class sessions has increased to two, one in the morning and the other in the
      afternoon. The number of children attending anganwadis has also substantially increased.
II. Institutional Change/Strengthening
A. Tamil Nadu
86.   The project resulted in a substantial institutional development impact in the following
areas:
87.   Biometric cards. The issue of biometric cards, which was introduced in 2008, has helped to
eliminate duplicate claims and fraud. Under this system, all beneficiaries are issued biometric
cards. This system will be extended for all future projects.
88.    Self-Help Groups. Altogether about 700 SHGs have been formed, and their main thrust is
on micro-savings and micro financing. In addition, SHGs conduct meetings, store products, and
facilitate improved life styles for the members. For example, in the horticulture sector, about 170
SHGs formed in four districts are used for purchase of materials. The farmers have also formed
commodity groups which arrange for selling their products. In the agricultural sector, about 480
Tsunami Farmers SHGs have been formed, and they have created awareness on agricultural
inputs and land reclamation. Farmers’ interest groups have been formed to discuss common
interests of the groups.
89.   Capacity Building. Training programs given to farmers have exposed them to scientific
methods of cultivation. For example, their irrigation sources increased due to use of PVC
pipelines and rain water harvesting in farm ponds.
90.   Animal Husbandry. Community-based centers are used for increasing the capacity of rural
folks on various aspects of animal husbandry activities such as de-worming, rearing cows and
calves, artificial insemination, vaccinations, tests for pregnancies of cows and buffalos.
Advanced specialized instruments and equipment given to veterinary hospitals and dispensaries,
and advanced training given to veterinary staff on all animal husbandry activities have
strengthened their capacities to discharge their functions more effectively and efficiently.
91.   Agriculture. The project contributed to creating awareness on soil testing. After the
tsunami, affected farmers are doing soil testing on a regular basis after harvesting season. They
are also adopting fertilizer recommendations as per the soil testing recommendations from the
Departments of Horticulture and Agriculture.
92.   Forestry: Training given at local levels resulted in better management of calamities and in
creating assets, shelterbelts, and mangrove plantations.




                                                  16
B. Puducherry:
93.    The project resulted in a strong institutional development impact in Puducherry as well:
     GoPy/PIA benefitted significantly through this project because it was their first exposure to
      an externally aided project. Their capacity building on the Bank procedures, particularly
      those related to procurement, was substantive.
     PIA was established under this project to hasten works pertaining to tsunami rehabilitation.
      Originally, the PIA was to be decommissioned after the project was completed. During
      project implementation, however, GoPy realized the benefits of implementing initiatives
      under the “project mode? through the PIA. GoPy chose to execute some of their physical
      works through the PIA. These were completed by the PIA on schedule and at costs lower
      than those incurred for similar works done directly by the GoPy. While unintended, this
      demonstrated that the PIA as an organization can be more efficient and effective than the
      conventional GoPy approaches. Seeing the advantages to execute works in a quick and
      effective manner, GoPy decided to continue with the PIA for all initiatives that needs to be
      done in a typical “project mode.?
III. Other Unintended Outcomes and Impacts (positive or negative)
Positive
     One important unintended outcome was the overwhelming response from NGOs because
      grants for housing reconstruction were unexpected at project preparation. This outcome led
      to huge savings in project funds, subsequent project restructuring, and the addition of VRCC
      component. The ability of GoTN to work in partnership with NGOs for post disaster
      reconstruction and put in place both a regulatory framework as well as support system to
      jointly achieve reconstruction outcomes was enhanced.
     As in the case of GoTN/ GoPy Tsunami Rehabilitation Program (TRP) houses, all
      ETRP/VRCC houses in Puducherry and two districts in Tamil Nadu, namely Cuddalore and
      Villupuram, which were hit by Cyclone Thane between 29th and 30th December 2011, were
      able to survive this cyclone without any damage. This success is directly attributable to
      disaster-resistant framed structures used on these houses for withstanding cyclones and other
      natural calamities.
     Through this project, substantive experience has been gained in the in situ reconstruction of
      houses for strengthening their disaster resistance. The benefits of the in situ reconstruction
      over construction in a relocated site have been realized, particularly in Puducherry. With the
      paucity of land available, there will be more and more of in situ reconstruction in the future.
      The experience gained during this project will form the basis of similar future
      projects/initiatives.
Negative
     In the case of the Marina project, there is an unintended negative consequence of the transit
      housing not being demolished in the originally intended timeframe and thereby causing
      problems related to managing them.
     In providing rural in situ housing rehabilitation under the VRCC component, some people
      ended-up getting disaster-resistant houses that became the best houses in the habitation.
      Others who did not qualify for houses were unhappy. In certain cases, this resulted in
      social/community tensions.

                                                  17
     The unexpected closure of the project when many of the works were ongoing has resulted in
      slowing down the progress of implementation. In Puducherry, due to fund unavailability
      within GoPy, there is a strong possibility that these works will be reduced in scope and
      therefore may not realize its full benefits.
3.6 Summary of Findings of Beneficiary Survey and/or Stakeholder Workshops
       N/A

4. Assessment of Risk to Development Outcome
A. Tamil Nadu
Rating: Negligible to Low
94.  The ICR team considers that the risk to development outcome would be negligible to low,
based on the factors mentioned in Section 2.5 (a) under the Financial sub-heading.
B. Puducherry
Rating: Significant
95.   As the project was closed before the completion of majority of the works, there is a high
risk that the development outcome will not be realized. This is more so in the case of the
Livelihood component where the unfinished works are many. In the case of the Housing
component, there is moderate risk that the in situ housing reconstruction and the works are either
completed or nearing completion.

5. Assessment of Bank and Borrower Performance

5.1 Bank Performance
(a) Bank Performance in Ensuring Quality at Entry
Rating: Satisfactory.
96.   A Quality at Entry Assessment (QEA7) was carried out in August 2005 by a QAG panel of
reviewers for the project. The project's overall quality at entry received a Satisfactory rating. This
was comprised of Highly Satisfactory ratings for Strategic Relevance and Approach; and Bank
Inputs and Processes. Technical, financial and economic aspects, poverty, gender and social
development, environmental aspects, fiduciary aspects, policy and institutional aspects,
implementation arrangements, and risk assessment received a Satisfactory rating. The ICR team
concurs with the above findings of QAG. According to the ICR team, the Bank's performance in
the identification, preparation, and appraisal of the project was satisfactory based on the
following factors:
97.   During preparation and appraisal, the Bank took into account the adequacy of project
design and all major relevant aspects, such as technical, financial, economic, and institutional,
including procurement and financial management. A large team, with a strong and relevant skill
mix, was mobilized quickly to prepare the emergency operation within four months. It is worth
pointing out that being an emergency project prepared at a rapid pace, the project design had a
few shortcomings such as (a) too many activities and implementing agencies and (b) an overly
optimistic implementation schedule of 36 months.

                                                 18
(b) Quality of Supervision
Rating: Moderately Unsatisfactory
98.   Sufficient budget and staff resources were allocated, and the project was adequately and
intensively supervised, and closely monitored. The Task Team prepared Aide-Memoires
regularly prepared and alerted the Governments and the PMU/PIA to problems with project
execution and facilitated remedies in a timely manner, in conformity with the Bank procedures.
The Implementation Status Reports (ISRs) realistically rated the performance of the project both
in terms of achievement of development objectives and project implementation. The Task Team
also monitored safeguard and fiduciary compliances.
99.  Bank’s procurement and financial management proficient staff worked with the PMU and
implementing agencies in Tamil Nadu, and PIA in Puducherry staff to explain the rules and
procedures to be applied during (a) project implementation, (b) procurement of goods and works,
and (c) selection of consultants, accounts and audits, based on the Credit and Project
Agreements. The Task Team carried out a Mid-Term Review in March 2007 to review the
progress of implementation as well as the restructuring of the project. Further, based on the
recommendations of the MTR, measures were taken to ensure improvement in implementation
performance.
100. On the other hand, there were a few major shortcomings on the part of the Bank during
implementation as explained below:
     Implementation support appears to have slackened during restructuring, which started in late
      2007 but took about two years to complete.
     The preliminary M&E framework developed in the original project design was not detailed.
      Further, a number of outcome indicators were not monitored.
     Bank’s Task Team did not include a Fisheries expert in its supervision team until about four
      years after project commencement.
     Bank’s Task Team did not focus adequately on the implementation support required by
      GoPY / PIA. In addition, the focus of tsunami rehabilitation was on the housing
      reconstruction, and not on the livelihood component.
     Delay in the decision on the extension of the credit closing date.
101. In hindsight, it was optimistic to assume that - with major restructuring that included
addition of a major ex ante disaster risk reduction component – the project could be implemented
in two years. Moreover, the restructuring process itself was protracted. The restructured project
is very different from the original project, essentially a new project. Following restructuring, the
project arguably required more time to complete implementation.
(c) Justification of Rating for Overall Bank Performance
Rating: Moderately Unsatisfactory
102. Based on the Bank performance during lending phase and supervision as discussed above,
overall Bank Performance is rated as Moderately Unsatisfactory.




                                                 19
5.2 Borrower Performance
A. Government Performance
Rating: Moderately Satisfactory.
103. As mentioned in Section 2.1, the GoI, GoTN, and GoPy had shown their commitment to
the objective of the project at the time of project preparation. Further, both GoI and GoTN had
displayed strong commitment towards the objectives of the first restructuring, as demonstrated
by: (a) Government parallel-financing for reconstruction of about 25,000 vulnerable houses; (b)
comprehensive preparatory activities; (c) completion of beneficiary selection; (d) advance
actions taken with respect to procurement of various outsourced resources; and (e) demonstrated
leadership on the part of GoTN to incorporate lessons learned from the ongoing operation.
104. GoTN and GoPy always considered that ETRP was one of their many tsunami
rehabilitation initiatives and not a stand-alone project. For instance, in Tamil Nadu, the PMU
(created under Bank-funded ETRP and ADB’s TEAP) was involved in the overall tsunami
rehabilitation activities that were well beyond ETRP implementation. It is therefore to be noted
that evaluating ETRP implementation in isolation may not convey the same picture as evaluating
GoTN’s overall tsunami rehabilitation performance, which is regarded as very successful and
appropriate to the context. Therefore, the ETRP objective of contributing towards a successful
GoTN’s overall program was accomplished.
105. In the case of Puducherry, although this project was the first experience of the Union
Territory to externally aided funding, the project lacked adequate attention on the activities of the
PIA from the GoPy during implementation.
B. Implementing Agency or Agencies Performance
Rating: Moderately Unsatisfactory.
Tamil Nadu:
106. For the line departments/agencies responsible for the implementation of their respective
components, the performance ratings are as follows:
107. RD&PR: This Department was responsible for the implementation of housing
reconstruction. It awarded 157 contracts and managed them quite well. As mentioned earlier,
around 4,200 houses were completed at project closure. The remaining ones are in advanced
stages of construction. The Department’s coordinated in an effective and efficient manner -
starting from procuring contractors, obtaining statutory clearance, having a MIS and oversight of
the construction. This turned out to be an example of good practice. This was the only
department, which had established a full fledged PIU. Headed by an Indian Administrative
Service (IAS) officer, the PIU had an elaborate institutional set up, with management units both
at the state and district levels. Its overall performance was Satisfactory.
108. TNSCB was fully committed and it had put into effect biometric system; constituted
grievance committees especially in Marina; and screened applications for housing. Further, the
system of selection of beneficiaries was extremely rigorous and robust. However, because of the
tremendously challenging task of dealing with Marina’s fishermen community, its efforts did not
result in the intended outcomes. It also lacked coordination of its activities and its performance
fluctuated depending on the prevailing leadership. Based on these factors, TNSCB’s
performance is rated Moderately Unsatisfactory.

                                                 20
109. Department of Fisheries was not geared up to do project activities as it lacked capacity
and right direction. Till four years into project implementation, no substantive progress was
made even in preparing the technical details and designs of the sub-components. Statutory
clearances were delayed due to the lack of follow-up and contract awards were delayed till the
last year of the project. Therefore, no works were completed by the credit closure. Based on
these factors, its performance is rated Unsatisfactory.
110. PWD-Buildings: PWD’s activities consisted of two phases. In the first phase it did a good
job of reconstructing buildings for different line departments. But its performance in the second
phase dealing with VRCC component faltered because of the issues related to coordination with
various consultants and PMU for the construction of evacuation shelters. Overall, PWD-
Buildings performance is rated Moderately Satisfactory.
111. PWD-Water Resources (WRO): There were lapses on the part of WRO in properly
assessing social impacts and ensuring environmental and social management, especially in one
site where one family was displaced. With Bank’s intervention, this issue was addressed. PWD-
WRO’s performance is thus rated Moderately Satisfactory.
112. TWAD. On the one hand, in conjunction with the PMU, TWAD had introduced new
sewage treatment technologies to address the low groundwater table problem prevailing in
coastal Tamil Nadu. On the other hand, TWAD’s performance was marked by lack of priorities,
efforts, and attention. TWAD took much more than required time in identifying, designing and
tendering. In some instances, it turned out that under public pressure they had to abandon the
work midway indicating a lack of dialogue in planning and designing stage. Procurement was
particularly a major issue in TWAD - they had to tender up to six or seven times to get the
contractors, evaluations often were delayed and many contractors did not extend bid validity.
This lead to re-tendering. For these reasons, TWAD’s performance is rated Moderately
Unsatisfactory.
113. Forest Department was able to complete the plantation of shelter belts and mangroves
within first two years of project implementation. As part of these activities, the Department had
taken up ‘Entry Point Activities’ such as provision of water and sanitation facilities, mobilization
of communities for the management these facilities. All these activities were well received by the
coastal communities. The Department was conscious of not affecting the coastal ecology and
responded to the complaints on the impacts of shelter belt plantation on the ‘Olive Ridley
Turtles’ and implemented suitable remedial actions. Considering all these factors, the
performance of the Forest Department is rated as Satisfactory.
114. Departments of Animal Husbandry, Agriculture, Horticulture, Town Panchayats, and
the Commissionerate of Municipal Administration completed their activities as per their
respective schedules. Their performances were Satisfactory.
115. Department of Environment. The project components implemented by the Department of
Environment included: (a) demarcation of High Tension Line along the Coast; (b) construction
of HTL pillars; (c) preparation of integrated coastal zone management plan; and (d) restoration
of water bodies in the affected districts. Of all these activities, the Department was able to only
complete activity (a) and partially complete activity (c). Considering these factors, the
implementation performance of the Department of Environment is rated as Moderately
Unsatisfactory.


                                                21
Rating: Since the performance of various agencies ranged from satisfactory to unsatisfactory, the
overall performance of implementing agencies is rated Moderately Unsatisfactory.
Puducherry
116. Pertaining to the performance ratings, the following are to be noted:
   Being the first time, PIA team had limited capacity in implementing the project using the
    Bank procedures, particularly procurement. For the PIA team, it turned out to be much more
    paperwork management, e.g. consulting contract management and obtaining the Bank
    approvals, than overseeing actual physical implementation. While the PIA team executed in
    parallel other non-Bank supported initiatives, the PIA team could not ensure effective
    progress in ETRP implementation.
   The lack of a full time Project Director based in the PIA resulted in the slackening of their
    performance. Having such a full time Project Director may have helped make effective and
    substantive progress in implementation.
   On FM aspects, PIA was always headed by an experienced financial controller and got
    requisite support from the part time accounting firm on maintenance of financial records for
    the project transactions. Although there were marginal delays in the submission of IUFRs
    and semi-annual audit reports to the Bank, the FM performance had remained satisfactory in
    an overall sense.
Rating: Based on the above factors, PIA performance is rated Moderately Unsatisfactory.
C. Justification of Rating for Overall Borrower Performance
Rating: Moderately Unsatisfactory.
117. The overall performance of the Borrower is rated Moderately Unsatisfactory.

6. Lessons Learned
118. The lessons emerging from ETRP are as follows:
   Timeframe planning has to be realistic. The original timeframe for completion of ETRP was
    three years. While it is true that reconstruction should be completed at the earliest, it is
    unrealistic to expect a large emergency reconstruction project, involving several agencies and
    a large geographical area (Tamil Nadu has about 1,000 km long coast line that was affected
    by tsunami) with a credit outlay of US$465 million (project cost $682.6 million) to be
    completed in a span of three years. The initial timeframe should have been more realistic
    with a longer project period.
   Simple project design is preferable. In response to the tsunami impacts and the associated
    needs, ETRP was designed to include several project sub-components involving multiple
    departments. As many as 13 implementing agencies were involved. Having such a diverse
    project design results in multiple coordination and implementation challenges. With a
    simpler and more focused project design, more effective implementation outcomes could
    have been achieved. Restricting the project design to 3 or 4 sectors and implementing
    agencies should necessarily be considered in future disaster response projects.
   There should be flexibility in project design and frequent review. As emergency
    reconstruction projects are prepared soon after the natural disaster, the design tends to be
    influenced by whatever information is available, e.g. extent of damaged houses, at that time.

                                               22
    Over time, this information is constantly updated and revised to reflect the actual ground
    requirements. Therefore, the project design will also have to be periodically revised and
    updated. In this context, it is important to take a flexible design approach through frequent
    reviews during the initial implementation period and to be open to early restructuring. As
    ETRP has evidenced, a well-prepared emergency project can have a poor implementation
    performance because of issues external to the project (e.g. unexpected NGO funding).
    Emergency projects should have annual reviews rather than standard Mid-Term review. By
    restructuring early and quickly and may be more frequently, better implementation outcomes
    could have been realized.
   Special mechanisms to meet fiduciary arrangements are required. Bank procedures for
    emergency projects aim to substantially compress the preparation time. However, planning
    mechanisms for facilitating speedier implementation normally receive little attention. During
    preparation, the Government and the Bank should also focus on how these procedural delays
    can be minimized through special fiduciary arrangements.
   Greater emphasis should be placed on implementation coordination. For effective
    implementation, the Government should ensure more regular day-to-day coordination
    between the project management agency (PMU in GoTN and PIA in GoPY), the
    implementing agencies, the contractors, the consultants and communities. Such constant
    coordination requires the allocation of dedicated human resources at various levels – state,
    district and community levels. Having such human resources and building their capacity
    appropriately enhances implementation progress. For instance, there should be no
    compromise vis-à-vis the role of a full time project director. In the case of Puducherry,
    having a full time dedicated project director would definitely have facilitated speedier
    implementation through effective, timely coordination.
   All components must be simultaneously implemented. In ETRP, the housing component
    tended to be the sole focus in the initial period of implementation. For instance, the GoI and
    GoPY gave housing the top priority. Therefore, the PIA chose to sequence implementation
    and deferred actions pertaining to the Fisheries and Livelihood component. This has resulted
    in incomplete outcomes in constructing the Fisheries infrastructure even after six years of
    project implementation.
   Local support team is a must. As the response required is immediate, the Bank should
    provide a local support team to build the capacity (particularly on fiduciary and safeguard
    processes), to constantly advise and work on a day-to-day basis with the Government in
    order to achieve effective results. In the case of ETRP, one full-time Chennai based Bank
    staff was appointed at the explicit request of the GoTN after mid-term review. This local
    support provided timely, valuable implementation support and feedback that greatly assisted
    project implementation and has been well acknowledged by the counterparts in Tamil Nadu
    and Puducherry. Similar arrangements should be included in future emergency reconstruction
    projects, from the beginning.
   M&E framework should be more comprehensive. As emergency projects are prepared when
    information is limited, the M&E design has to be flexible. Only a basic M&E framework can
    be developed during preparation. As and when the project design is confirmed during
    implementation, a comprehensive M&E framework needs to be prepared. A detailed baseline
    assessment also needs to be completed in time in order to be able to confirm project
    outcomes-- post-implementation. It is also important that the number of indicators is limited
    and targets are realistic and achievable. In ETRP, the original M&E framework was basic

                                               23
    and a comprehensive M&E framework was developed too late during implementation.
    Therefore, tracking development outcomes has been rendered difficult.
   A new project should have been considered as an alternative to restructuring. The
    restructuring process focused on utilizing the use of expected savings. This resulted in
    addition of a completely new component vis-à-vis the original project design. At that time,
    discussions should have been held with the borrower on designing a new project focusing on
    disaster risk reduction rather than combining reconstruction with risk reduction.
   Decision on credit closure / extension should be taken in advance. While the credit closure
    date was known, the final decision not to extend the project closing date was taken shortly
    before the closing date, creating significant challenges for GoTN and GoPY as they
    attempted to complete the various activities already initiated. This could have been avoided if
    the final decision on credit closure was taken early, at least six months prior to closure.

7. Comments on Issues Raised by Borrower/Implementing Agencies/Partners
(a) Borrower/implementing agencies
120. GoTN’s comment (para 68): The para and Annex X may be modified suitably to upgrade
the rating to at least Moderately satisfactory in view of the fact that the performance of almost all
implementing departments were remarked as satisfactory in the report.
121. ICR Team’s response: Performance of several implementing agencies is not rated
satisfactory and therefore overall rating remains.
122. GoTN’s comment (Section 3.2 A.II): Under ETRP VRCC Housing undertaken by the
RDD commendable achievement has been done which has been even appreciated by the various
implementation support mission of World Bank. Out of 14569 houses, 4121 houses which is
29% of the total had been completed as on 31.12.2011 and the balance houses were also in
various stages of construction. About Rs.300 crores has been incurred as on 31.12.2011 for this
work out of the total cost of about Rs.582 crores. The cost of the other two works is relatively
small and their total constitutes only Rs.60 crores. Hence it is felt that appropriate higher
weightage need to be given to the VRCC housing work while drawing rating. If so done, then
the present rating will certainly improve. Therefore this issue may be re examined in the light of
our note.
123. ICR Team’s response: In order to achieve objectives of vulnerability reduction, the other
components contribute significantly. Therefore, only with marginally satisfactory performance in
housing component the overall rating will not change.
124. GoTN’s comment (Section 3.4): In view of the fact that almost all of pre VRCC
components were completed, the VRCC Housing work which is a massive project was
progressing well at the time of closure of the ETRP whose achievement was also commended by
the World Bank Mission and the other VRCC works/Fisheries infrastructure works would be
fully completed if the World Bank considered the 1 year extension and further taking into note
the long time taken for sanctioning the VRCC Programme by the World Bank the achievements
made were remarkable. Hence the ranking may be upgraded into Moderately Satisfactory.




                                                 24
125. ICR Team’s response: All pre VRCC components were not completed such as Urban
Housing Reconstruction, Fisheries Infrastructure, Sanitation works, etc. Rating is based on actual
achievement at the project closure. The rating is therefore retained
126. GoTN’s comment (para 115): Under activity d the department intended to take bio-
remediation work to Pallikarannai Marsh at a cost of Rs.4.00 crore. But this proposal was not
approved by the World Bank. Hence it was to be dropped. Activity ii was also completed
partially i.e. in 3 districts out of 13 districts at the time of closure of ETRP. Now the work is
going on in 9 districts and will be completed soon. Similarly more than 50% of work under item
iii has been completed and the remaining work will be soon over. Considering these
achievements, the rating of this department needs suitable upgradation.
127. ICR Team’s response: The rating is based on actual completion of works and
achievement of objectives at project closure.
128. GoTN’s comment (para 112): It is quite unreasonable to award the Moderately
Unsatisfactory rating to TWAD since this department had completed 12 packages out of 16
considered under ETRP and out of the remaining 4 three were in advance stage of completion as
on 31.12.2011. Further the department incurred Rs.24.19 crore out of Rs.30.00 crore sanctioned
under ETRP. Considering these aspects, the performance rating needs suitable upgradation.
129. ICR Team’s response: The rating takes into account all the factors related to design and
procurement delays over an implementation period of about seven years.
130. GoPy’s Comment. “The procurement through the Bank’s processes was real stumbling
block when it was most needed.?
131. ICR Team’s response: Procurement requirements of the Bank are different from those
followed by the Government. During project implementation, sufficient capacity-building has
been carried out on the Bank’s procurement requirements. Staff involved both within GoTN and
GoPy are sufficiently equipped to deal with these requirements. Many relaxations were also
given on a case-to-case basis. And the project was implemented over a 6-year timeframe.
Considering the Bank’s procurement has been the real stumbling block for not completing the
project does not provide the correct overall picture. It is one of the many challenges that the
borrower had to face as a part of implementation.
132. GoPy’s Comment. “However it could now be said with hindsight that the project did not
provide adequate attention to the capacity building of PIA, design considerations, stakeholders’
views and environmental considerations of the project. The latter two resulted in re-working of
the sub-components that delayed the overall project.?
133. ICR Team’s response: The gap between GoPy’s PIA and the project’s requirements was
large. While capacity building was undertaken, it took time for the PIA to absorb such technical
inputs and adhere to new processes in line with these inputs.
134. GoPy’s Comment: Section 3.5, Justification of Outcome Rating (Page 26): The outcome
should be rated as moderately satisfactory.
135. ICR Team’s response: Earlier rating retained.
136. GoPy’s Comment: Section 4, Assessment of Risk to Development Outcomes (Page 28): In
the case of the Housing component, there is moderate risk that the in situ housing reconstruction
and the works are either completed or nearing completion.

school building), roads, street lighting and electricity connections

Infrastructure in municipalities. Infrastructure facilities were provided to the houses that were
constructed by the NGOs in five tsunami-affected municipalities - Nagapattinam, Vedaranyam,
Cuddalore, Colachal and Kayalpattinam. Outputs consisted of 31.855 km of roads and 4.257 km
of drains, water supply connection to 1,472 houses, construction of eight public buildings such as
community centers, noon meal centers, and street lights.

Electricity connections. In 200 villages in 50 panchayats in eight tsunami affected coastal
districts, electricity connections to about 23,000 houses and 2,360 street light connections were
completed.

Repairs to damaged dwellings. In Nagapattinam and Cuddalore Districts, repairs were done on
2145 fully/partly damaged dwellings.

B. Restoration of livelihoods

Agriculture. 8175.35 hectares of sand cast agricultural lands were reclaimed. Agriculture
machinery and equipment and drip irrigation sets were supplied. Training programs on
livelihood restoration and public awareness were conducted.

Horticulture. About 670 hectares of horticultural lands were reclaimed with the participation of
169 SHGs. Reclamation consisted of removal of sand, soil testing, application of gypsum/red soil,
sowing of green manure seeds, distribution of planting materials. Further, subsistence allowance
was provided to the tsunami-affected farmers.

Animal Husbandry. Equipment for surgical, diagnostic, breeding and laboratory purposes for
treating about 18000 livestock were purchased and distributed to Government veterinary
dispensaries.

Marina Reconstruction Scheme.

      Nochinagar: 628 tenements are structurally completed and the finishing work is
       progressing. Infrastructure works are also making good progress. Full completion is
       likely by June 2012.

      Nochi Kuppam: Construction of about 800 tenements for Nochi Kuppam beneficiaries
       did not commence as only 417 out of 780 occupants have vacated and moved to the
       transit houses.

      Sanitation infrastructure. 67.85 km of collection systems, 3,594 manholes, 1,021
       interceptors, 49 pump rooms with 116 pump sets and 47 treatment systems have been
       constructed by TWAD.

B. Restoration of livelihoods

Fisheries The Fisheries Department undertook the following works: (a) Reconstruction &
modernization of fishing harbours – Pazhayar and Nagapattinam, (b) Opening of river barmouths
for providing permanent stability at Portonovo (Vellar River) and Tirumullaivasal (Uppanar
River), (c) Fish Landing Centres at Nagore and Portnovo-Annankovil, and (d) Tube Ice Plant at
Chinnamutam.

Due to the time taken for obtaining various statutory clearances to commence the works, actual
construction works (other than Vellar Bar mouth and Chinnamuttom Tube Ice Plant) could be
started only towards the end of the project and is excepted to be financed under DRRP and to be
completed by March 2013.

C. Vulnerability Reduction of coastal Communities (VRCC):

Housing: Out of the planned 14369 houses, about 4200 houses have been completed, and the
remaining ones are expected to be completed by December 2012, with the financing from DRRP.

Evacuation shelters: The proposal was to construct 121 numbers of Multi Purpose Evacuation
Shelters in 12 coastal Districts of Tamil Nadu where people do not have quick access to safe
shelters within their locality during natural disasters. The work is expected to commence by May,
2012 and end in September, 2013, and is likely to be financed under the DRRP.

Evacuation routes. Original plan was to construct 150 km of evacuation routes. However, after
study it was considered that only 45 km of routes may be required. Bids have been received and
tenders are under process. The work is expected to be completed by September 2012.

Early warning system: 439 early warning systems have been planned to be installed in different
locations identified along the 1076 coast line, and central unit is to be installed in the office of
the Commissioner of Revenue Administration and Collectors. Bid documents have been issued,
and tenders have been received. Technical bid evaluation process has also been initiated.

A. Housing Reconstruction. 1,752 houses were built under the Project, out of which, 300
houses at Nallavadu were under relocation housing built through a contractor based construction
and the remaining was in situ, where the beneficiaries took up construction on their own. Of
these, about 550 houses were completed so far through beneficiary-driven approach, which has
established itself as a viable alternative particularly for in situ housing reconstruction.

B. Livelihood Restoration – Fisheries. Activities scheduled under this component, namely,
work shelters, fish markets, and fishing harbor could not be completed before credit closing.

C. Technical Assistance and Training: The training component included: (a) fisheries training
institute and (b) capacity building of PIA staff. The former was dropped after efforts because the
consultant finalization was inordinately delayed as identified consultant costs were prohibitively
high. Given the delay, completion would not be possible and therefore it was dropped. In terms
of capacity building of the PIA, there was training given on the Bank's procedures and
requirements. Being their first exposure to the Bank, an individual consultant was employed at
the initial stage itself to support the PIA on an ongoing basis under the Fisheries sector. However,
the chosen consultant was not appropriate to the PIA's needs. Subsequently, consulting firms
were employed to strengthen the PIA capacity both at a project level and at a sectoral level.
Though much improved, multiple layers of consulting support caused its own problems. The lack
of the PIA's staff capacity and the lack of effective consulting support constrained
implementation progress.

                           Annex 3. Economic and Financial Analysis

1.     This project was of the framework type, i.e. most major investments were not identified
or designed in detail before project effectiveness. Given the diverse nature of the emergency
reconstruction, specific investments projects were identified based on the need of the individual
sectors during project implementation. From the sample of the projects reviewed, there is
evidence that different alternatives were assessed. This was done in order to determine those that
are economically justified and would be cost-effective. The usual screening mechanisms
embedded in the Bank's procurement processes were used to select contractors who would
provide the maximum value for the financial expenditures to be incurred. Through these
approaches, efficiency was ensured. Considering that many projects had to go through a repeated
bidding process, it can be assumed that maximum efficiency was attained given the prevailing
market circumstances and constraints.
2.      Being an emergency reconstruction project, most of the investments were in housing
infrastructure and livelihood infrastructure. As it is the case in the infrastructure sector, the costs
are direct whereas the benefits are indirect and will be realized only through the various
development outcomes. As they are indirect, it is difficult to ascertain the economic benefits
without proper pre-investment baseline studies and post-investment outcome analysis. In
addition, many investments were not completed at the time of credit closure. Therefore, it was
premature to carry out post-investment outcome analysis to provide a better insight into
economic benefits. Considering this situation, it has not been possible to quantitatively assess the
indirect economic benefits that the project investments have realized. However, qualitatively, the
nature and type of investments - being infrastructure in nature - are directly relevant to the
tsunami-affected communities and appear to have economic benefits that will outweigh the costs
incurred.

A. Tamil Nadu

Background

1.       The tsunami that struck the Tamil Nadu coast on December 26, 2004 was unprecedented
in its suddenness and ferocity. Nearly 1 million people in 13 coastal districts were affected, 7995
human lives were lost, 3504 persons were injured and 472,000 persons were dislocated. About
18,000 cattle were killed and the loss of crops and property were of great magnitude. The
tsunami resulted in untold miseries to coastal communities.

2.      An overall damage assessment was done. It was estimated that short and medium term
reconstruction needs exceeded the immediate financing capacity of the Government of Tamil
Nadu (GoTN). To fill the gap, the Government of India (GoI) requested assistance from the
World Bank, ADB and the UN for its post-tsunami recovery program, which encompassed
livelihood support, micro-enterprises, housing, roads, ports, health, education, environment, and
coastal protection and risk mitigation.

3.     The tsunami relief and rehabilitation works were carried out at a cost of nearly Rs. 5,000
crores with funds from the GoTN (Rs. 671 crores), GoI (Rs. 2,347 crores), the World Bank (Rs.
884 crores), Asian Development Bank (Rs. 622 crores), Japan Fund for Poverty Reduction (Rs.
17 crores), Prime Minister’s Relief Fund (Rs. 341 crores) and Member of Parliament Local Area
Development Funds (Rs. 23 crores) with the NGOs/ INGOs chipping-in with the construction of
around 30,471 houses besides supply of essential relief materials to the affected families.

Development objectives / outcomes

5.    As per the original project design, the project objective was to support the effort of the
GoTN to revive livelihoods and promote recovery in the tsunami-affected areas.

6.     When the project was re-structured, the development objectives were modified as
follows:

   To revive livelihoods and promote recovery in the tsunami-affected areas in the short-term;
    and to reduce the vulnerability of coastal communities to a range of natural hazards such as
    cyclone, storm surge, flood and tsunami over the longer term.
   In addition to the original project outcomes, the major outcomes expected of the restructuring
    included: (a) reduced vulnerability of the reconstructed houses to natural disasters, (b)
    increased community participation towards early warning systems, and (c) improved
    community access to evacuation routes and shelters.

Project Implementation

Component 1: Housing Reconstruction

(a) Tamil Nadu Slum Clearance Board (TNSCB)

8.      Ready-built houses: The allocation of ready built houses to tsunami-affected was
effective in providing timely accommodation. At two locations – Semmancheri &
Thazankuppam – 4,526 tenements of ready-built houses were retroactively financed / purchased
under the project. Out of these, 3,948 tenements have been given to eligible beneficiaries with
photo identity card. The issuing of biometric cards to beneficiaries was done to avoid duplication.
This was initiated in Tamil Nadu for the first time. This practice is now being adopted across the
state.

9.      Newly built tenements at All India Radio (AIR) site: This site was identified for building
new tenements in 2007. Construction was started in 2008 and 3,616 tenements were constructed
at this site. The building works have since been completed. The water supply and sewerage
works for this site was initially proposed through CMWSSB. This was subsequently taken up by
the TNSCB except collection well and pumping main to sewerage plant. This is now expected to
be completed by March 2012. Eligible beneficiaries have been identified; photo identity and
biometric cards will be issued prior to allotment of these tenements.

10.    Newly built tenements at Okkiyum Thuraipakkam: In this site, 2, 048 tenements were
proposed to be constructed in TNSCB owned site. Due to a litigation and consequent stay by the
Honorable High Court of Madras, the construction could not be taken up beyond basement level
for more than a year. After favorable verdict of the court, in September 2010, the building
construction was restarted and the buildings are structurally completed and now the finishing
works are in progress. The infrastructure works – water supply, sewerage, roads and drains – will
be completed by the end of December 2012.

11.     Temporary shelters at Marina: The reconstruction under the Marina Re-development
project was taken up under this project. 2,468 transit shelters were built. As the construction of
permanent tenements at Marina was significantly reduced in view of issues relating to demand of
more houses by the residents the temporary shelters could not be fully utilized. 1,200 shelters are
occupied by residents who have consented for the construction of permanent tenements.

12.     Permanent tenements at Marina: Under the Marina Re-development project, 7,320
tenements were originally planned. However, in line with Department of Town & Country
Planning directive, this was reduced to 5, 856 tenements. These were meant for residents of
linear habitations in the Marina area – Nochi Nagar, Nochikuppam, Dommingkuppam,
Selvarajapuram, Srirnvasapuram and Foreshore Estate. Of these habitations, beneficiaries in
Nochi Nagar agreed to the construction of permanent tenements. These 628 tenements are
structurally completed and are in the finishing stage. Infrastructure works are under progress. In
Nochikuppam, some residents have agreed for the construction of permanent tenements and
others have chosen to continue in the old premises. Under these circumstances, it has not been
possible to initiate the construction of permanent tenements at Nochikuppam. In the other


                                                39
habitations, the residents have decided against the construction of permanent tenements at this
stage as there are issues relating to demand of more houses by the residents.

(b) Town panchayats

13.      In the tsunami affected town panchayats, under ETRP, works relating to infrastructure
facilities - reconstruction of public buildings (SHG, community halls, bus shelter, cremation shed,
shopping complex, library building, anganvadi and school building), roads, street lighting and
electricity connections - were taken up. All works have been completed in 2009 benefiting about
40,000 tsunami-affected population residing in these habitations.

(c) CMA

14.    In five tsunami-affected municipalities - Nagapattinam, Vedaranyam, Cuddalore,
Colachal and Kayalpattinam, the infrastructure was provided by GoTN under ETRP for the
houses that were constructed by the NGOs. In 20 habitations, infrastructure facilities, i.e. 31.855
km of roads and 4.257 km of drains, water supply by way of 1,472 house service connections, 8
nos. of public buildings like community centres and noon meal centres, and street lights were
provided. These works benefited 6,379 permanent shelters. All the works were completed before
April 2009.

(d) TWAD

15.     The widespread construction of houses for the tsunami-affected necessitated the
development of sanitation infrastructure. In selected urban towns, the provision of these
sanitation facilities was entrusted to TWAD. Altogether, 47 habitations in 6 districts were
covered through 16 contract packages. As housing was along the coast where the water table is
high, the choice of treatment technology had to be carefully decided based on location-specific
considerations. Three treatment technologies – Single Pass Intermediate Sand Filter (SPISF),
Decentralized Waste Water Treatment Systems (DEWATS) and Moving Bed Biological Reactor
(MBBR) – were chosen and successfully implemented. In all, TWAD has constructed 67.85 km
of collection systems, 3,594 manholes, 1,021 interceptors, 49 pump rooms with 116 pumpsets
and 47 treatment systems. The population of 37, 210 living in these 47 habitations have benefited
from the clean, healthy and hygienic environment. Due to time involved in appointment of
design consultant, tender response and challenges posed by the high groundwater table, three
packages in Nagapattinam and Cuddalore are under progress. These works will be completed by
June 30, 2012.

(e) RD & PR

16.    In 200 villages in 50 Panchayats in 8 tsunami affected coastal districts, 22, 859 electrical
house service connections and 2, 360 street light connections were provided in 2006-07 and
2007-08 as a measure of immediate relief to the affected people residing in these areas.

(f) Project Management Unit



                                                40
17.     In Nagapattinam and Cuddalore Districts immediate relief amount to repair 2145 fully /
partly damaged dwellings amounting to Rs. 2.75 crores was paid during 2006.

Component 2: Restoration of livelihoods

(a) Fisheries

18.     Fishermen community was the worst affected due to the tsunami. There was significant
loss of human life, property damage and livelihood impacts. Fishery infrastructure such as
harbours, jetties and fish landing centres were also badly damaged. Under ETRP, the following
works were undertaken: (a) Reconstruction & modernization of fishing harbours – Pazhayar and
Nagapattinam, (b) Opening of river barmouths for providing permanent stability at Portonovo
(Vellar River) and Tirumullaivasal (Uppanar River), (c) Fish Landing Centres at Nagore and
Portnovo-Annankovil, and (d) Tube Ice Plant at Chinnamutam. All of these works were started
after preparing detailed project reports and EIA reports, as required. Contracts could be awarded
only during the later part of the last year due to the time taken for project preparation as well as
the various statutory clearance requirements (forest, environment, TNPCB and CRZ clearances).
The works are expected to be completed between June, 2012 and December 2012. The opening
of river barmouths for providing permanent stability at Portonovo (Vellar River) and
Tirumullaivasal (Uppanar River) will benefit 10,000 fishermen of Cuddalore and Nagapattinam
Districts since 550 country crafts and 300 mechanized boats will venture into sea without
difficulty. Similarly, the proposed reconstruction and modernization of fishing harbours will
create new berthing capacity which will reduce the berthing congestion. Also, the annual fish
catch at Pazhayar fishing harbor would go upto 13,000 MT. Therefore, the proposed fishing
infrastructure, after completion and put to use, will restore, secure and enhance the fishermen’s
livelihoods and quality of life of the areas.

(b) Agriculture

19.      Tsunami caused both crop damage (4,796 ha) as well as semi-permanent damage due to
submergence / salinity intrusion (3,379 ha) to the agricultural lands. It also caused soil damage
and damage to irrigation sources which resulted in hardship among the affected farmers. There
was a serious threat that agricultural lands would turn fallow if not properly reclaimed. In order
to remedy the damages, a range of activities was undertaken: land reclamation and soil
restoration, public awareness & capacity building, irrigation infrastructure, machineries &
equipment, community borewells, farm ponds, drip irrigation sets, construction of thrashing
floors, livelihood restoration and monitoring and evaluation. Training programmes were taken up.
All the reclamation works were carried out by District Advisory Group consisting of the District
Collector as Chairman, and the officials of Agriculture, Horticulture and Agriculture University
Officials as members and involving the area self-help groups consisting of tsunami affected
farmers in order to ensure community participation to a great extent (477 in all). These works
achieved their intended outcome. Crop yield (kg / ha) improved well when compared to pre-
tsunami levels across the four major crops – paddy, groundnut, blackgram and coconut. The pH
of the water was also back to the pre-tsunami norms and was largely declared as fit for irrigation
across all the 5 districts – Kanchipuram, Cuddalore, Villupuram, Nagapattinam and
Kanyakumari. 13, 511 farmers benefitted from these activities.


                                                41
(c)Horticulture

20.     Similar to agricultural lands, the tsunami inundated the horticulture plantations and crop
fields in the districts of Villupuram, Cuddalore, Nagapatttinam and Kanyakumari resulting in
salinity of lands making them unusable for cultivation. Horticulture crops like mango, vegetables,
banana, cashew and flowers were affected to the extent of 669.82 ha. Rehabilitation works to
restore the affected lands for cultivation were initiated. This included removal of sand, soil
testing, application of gypsum / red soil, sowing of green manure seeds, distribution of planting
materials and providing subsistence allowance to the tsunami-affected farmers. 169 self-help
groups were formed and reclamation works were undertaken. Following the reclamation works,
the soil pH levels were brought back to pre-tsunami levels in the four affected districts and the
microclimate in the respective regions were restored.

(d) Animal Husbandry

21.      About 18,000 livestock comprising cattle, buffalo, sheep, goat and poultry died due to the
tsunami and this resulted in huge economic loss. GoTN undertook a number of initiatives to
address the impact of tsunami on animal husbandry practices in the State. In order to improve the
facilities for diagnosing and treating livestock equipments for surgical, diagnostic, breeding and
laboratory purposes were purchased. These efforts contributed towards strengthening livestock
management practices in the state.

Component 3: Public Buildings and Public Works

(a) PWD Buildings

22.     The tsunami had impacted a number of public and educational buildings and immediate
rectification was required to make them fit for use. In all, the following were done: (a) Repairs of
121 public buildings comprising cyclone shelters, students’ hostel buildings and memorial
buildings, (b) Repairs and re-construction/upgradation of 71 health institutions such as public
health centres, Govt. hospitals, primary health centres and health sub-centres, (c) Repairs of 112
veterinary hospitals, dispensaries, fodder banks, sub-centre, district extension counters and office
buildings, and (d) Repairs of 33 Government high schools and higher secondary school buildings.
All works were completed by March 2009.

(b) PWD (WRO)

23.    Post-tsunami, de-silting of the waterways and strengthening of the river banks were
found necessary in order to ensure that water ingress does not cause flooding in future. Ten
works of de-silting and strengthening of river banks were done measuring 122.6 km of the
waterways in Nagapattinam district. These works were implemented efficiently and completed in
2009 which resulted in the prevention of inundation and drainage congestion in 8,000 ha of
paddy fields leading to saving of 4,000 metric tons of paddy every year.




                                                42
(c)Forest department

24.     In the immediate aftermath of the tsunami, it was realized that the mangroves and
shelterbelt plantations acted as a shield that led to saving of human lives and reduction of
property damage. Therefore, additional shelterbelt and mangrove plantations were done under
ETRP. Altogether, 4,778 ha of shelterbelt plantations, 900 ha of shelterbelt plantations in private
lands and 2,162 ha of mangrove plantations were done. During implementation of the coastal
shelterbelt, care was taken to ensure that the turtle nesting habitats were not affected. A
document on the implementation experience of shelterbelt and mangrove plantations was also
prepared.

(d) Environment department

25.     As a part of the tsunami reconstruction, Department of Environment proposed to
strengthen the implementation of the planning regulation - Coastal Regulation Zone Notification
- through (a) demarcation of the High Tide Line (HTL) in the village cadastral maps on a scale of
1:5000, (b) erecting physical stone pillars for the entire coast of Tamil Nadu, and (c) the
preparation of Integrated Coastal Zone Management Plan (ICZMP). Due to the time involved in
the preparation of consultant’s report and appointment of contractors, these works will be
completed in the year 2012. After finalization of the ICZMP training programme to various stake
holders on ICZMP will be conducted. These efforts will result in improving the management of
the coastal zone of Tamil Nadu.

(e) PMU

26.     The Office of the PMU has to have adequate facilities for conference and meeting rooms
with adequate lighting, video and audio arrangements in order to periodically interact with the
line departments and World Bank Officials. Therefore repairs and reconstruction of the office of
the PMU and provision of meeting and conference halls with lighting, video and audio facilities
were carried out under this component.

Component 4: Technical Assistance and Training

27.    This component was intended to support the other components in terms of providing
technical assistance and training. Under this component of the ETRP, the following activities
were supported as technical assistance and training:

   Animal Husbandry: To support tsunami rehabilitation and strengthening of management
    practices, about 10,000 farmers were trained on animal rearing, animal feeding &
    management, de-worming and care of cattle during pregnancy. In addition, 82 community-
    based veterinary workers were trained on providing first aid, artificial insemination,
    vaccination, and de-worming.
   Fisheries: Preparation of DPRs for the fishery infrastructures that included the conducting of
    EIA reports was carried out.
   Environment: Engaging the consultants for the preparation of the ICZMP as well as for
    demarcating the HTL on the cadastral maps was carried out.

                                                43
   TNSCB: Project management consultants for the Marina Re-development works were
    supported.
   Sanitation in housing: Consultants for developing De-Centralized Waste Water Treatment
    System (DEWATS) were engaged under this component.
   Environment & Social Safeguards: Consultants for the conduct of environmental and social
    assessments for the various rural and urban housing projects were engaged.
   Third party NGO counseling: In the VRCC component, identification of beneficiaries was
    done with the support of third party NGOs under this component.
   Other technical assistance: Conduct of quality auditing, training programmes on construction
    design & practices and procurement workshops were undertaken.

Component 5: Implementation Support

28.    Under this component, the incremental operating cost comprising expenditures incurred
by the participating line departments – RD & PR, Environment, Fisheries, Municipal
Administration, Directorate of Town Panchayat, TWAD Board, TNSCB, Forests and the PMU
were borne. The incremental operating cost included general office expenses, hiring,
maintenance and operation of vehicles, office equipment and furniture and salaries and
allowances of staff employed for the purpose of implementing ETRP.

Restructured Component: Vulnerability Reduction in Coastal Communities

Reconstruction of Risk-prone Houses to Multi-Disaster Resistant Standards

29.    This is a new component under the revised and restated ETRP-VRCC programme. Under
this component, in situ re-construction of risk-prone Houses in the 200-1000 meter vicinity of
the HTL in tsunami affected 11 coastal Districts conforming to multi disaster resistance
standards was proposed. This work has been entrusted with RD & PR Department. 14, 369
houses are under construction in 11 districts. The verification of beneficiaries and obtaining their
agreement on the housing type designs was carried out by involving NGOs. The required CRZ
clearances were obtained and construction contracts have been awarded in two phases, i.e. in
May-June and August-October 2010. Till date, 4,121 houses have been completed. The
remaining works are steadily progressing and will be completed by December 31, 2012.

Emergency Evacuation and Early Warning Facilities

30.     Evacuation shelters: Emergency shelters contribute directly towards reducing the
vulnerability of coastal communities. PWD (Buildings) Department is carrying out this work.
121 multipurpose evacuation shelters have been selected in 12 coastal districts. Of these, 53
shelters required CRZ clearances which were obtained. The Consultants appointed for the survey
of the locations, preparation of type design, plans and estimates have completed these works.
Tenders also have been received and evaluation is presently under progress. Once tenders are
finalized, construction works will start. The work will be completed in one year.




                                                44
31.      Evacuation routes: To provide easy escape in times of emergencies, about 46 kms of
evacuation routes have been planned by RD & PR Department. Tenders have been received for
all the 42 packages and tender evaluation is under progress.

32.     Early warning systems: Given that TN’s 1,076 km long coast line is regularly subjected
to natural hazards, the use of latest technology to provide timely alerts was included under the
project. It is proposed to provide 439 early warning systems in different locations identified
along the coast and central unit is to be installed in the office of the Commissioner of Revenue
Administration and Collectors. Bid / specification documents were issued, tenders were received
and the technical bid evaluation process was initiated. Once fully completed, these early warning
systems would provide advance information that would lead to better preparedness and hence
reduced loss of human life and property damage in the event of any disasters.

Technical Assistance and Implementation Support

33.     Under this component of the VRCC, the following activities were supported as technical
assistance and training:

     Evacuation shelters & routes: The services of a design consultant for planning the multi-
      purpose evacuation shelters and evacuation routes and Quality monitoring consultants to
      oversee the construction activities during implementation have been engaged under this sub-
      component.
     Reconstruction of risk prone houses: Third party NGOs have been engaged for providing
      counseling and facilitation services for these beneficiaries both prior to construction and
      during construction.
     PIU RD & PR establishment costs: As the implementing agency, there is a separate PIU
      under the control of a project director to plan, execute and monitor the activities. These costs
      have also been borne under this sub-component.

Borrower Performance

34.      The following are the observations vis-à-vis Borrower’s performance:

     Procurement Policy: The Procurement policy of the World Bank has been effectively
      informed to all the implementing agencies resulting in smooth adoption of the policy without
      any time delay. The efforts and initiatives by PMU in this area require specific mention.
     Statutory clearances: Most of the infrastructure development to the fishing harbours/ bar
      mouths needed several statutory clearances such as MoEF, Forests, DTCP, CRZ clearances
      and Land Acquisition involving multiple departments of State and Central Governments.
      Such clearances were required in respect of construction of Evacuation Shelters and laying of
      evacuation routes too. Though time consuming, all the necessary clearances were obtained
      and all the requirements are complied with.
     Co-ordination among the Implementing Departments:: As the tsunami impact cuts across
      several sectors, ETRP reconstruction involved 14 implementing agencies within the GoTN.
      Therefore great efforts were required for effective coordination with all implementing
      departments. With the periodical monitoring of the programme by the Principal

                                                  45
      Secretary/Commissioner of Revenue Administration and with the reviews made by the
      Government at regular intervals, issues relating to the implementation of the Project were
      settled then and there. This has paved the way for the smooth implementation of the Project.
      Restructuring of ETRP with VRCC Component: Under ETRP the main Project Development
      Objective was focused on ‘Housing Reconstruction’ as this was the most affected sector due
      to tsunami. Hence, 87% of the Project Funds were ear marked for this particular component.
      Due to overwhelming response of large number of NGOs for housing reconstruction and
      GoTN’s decision to utilize GoI grants for the reconstruction of damaged rural infrastructure,
      only construction of houses in urban areas has been taken up under ETRP. Hence significant
      achievement could not be accomplished under ETRP in Housing Reconstruction component.
      With the private funding effectively replacing Bank funding, significant savings have
      resulted in the housing component of the project. However, the funds allocated for the other
      four components had been fully utilized. Higher, allocation available under the ‘Housing
      Construction’ component was the main reason for the initial slow utilization of the project
      fund. Even though the GoTN with large NGO funding has successfully rehabilitated the
      disaster affected communities and improved their housing quality, there were still a large
      number of coastal communities constantly threatened by sea surges, floods, cyclones and
      even future Tsunamis. Therefore, in order to take care of the safety needs of such coastal
      communities and to utilize the savings under ETRP, the ETRP was restructured in August,
      2009 by including a new component titled ‘Vulnerability Reduction of Coastal Communities-
      VRCC’.
     Time taken in designs/project preparation: Restated and revised ETRP-VRCC programme of
      ETRP was signed on 13.08.2009, after prolonged negotiations with the World Bank.
      Between March, 2007 and August, 2009, this process took nearly two and half years. This
      time gap has impacted the overall project Implementation period.
     Delays in implementation / execution: There were certain delays during implementation due
      to shortage of construction materials and manpower, getting statutory clearances, adherence
      to the World Bank procurement procedures, natural calamities occurred during the year 2008
      to 2011 and the enforcement of model code-of-conduct during the Assembly, Parliament and
      Local Body elections held in the years 2006, 2009 and 2011.
     Other factors: As per the observation made by the World Bank in the Operational Manual-
      Part F, para 4.1.10 of the ETRP-VRCC agreement, the ETRP-VRCC works will take 3 years
      to complete. However, between September, 2009 and December, 2011 the execution period
      was only 2 years and 4 months. Therefore, taking into account these factors a proposal was
      sent to World Bank in the month of January 2010 for extension of the Project period by one
      year, upto 31.12.2012. This request was subsequently reiterated in the TPRM held on
      16.8.2011 and further in the meeting held on 03.11.2011 by the Government of India with
      World Bank Officials. However, unexpectedly the ETRP was not extended beyond
      31.12.2011 by the World Bank. Due to this sudden decision of the World Bank, the
      implementation of ongoing ETRP has been put to difficulty till a new project is finalized.

35.      The following are the observations vis-à-vis World Bank’s performance:

     Damage assessment & initiating ETRP: Soon after the tsunami, the World Bank provided
      support to the GoTN in terms of establishing the overall framework for tsunami
      reconstruction. under ETRP in quick time.

                                                 46
     Restructuring ETRP: Later, after it is known that there was higher quantum of allocation
      under the ‘Housing Reconstruction’ component, the World Bank agreed to utilize the project
      saving for the ETRP-VRCC Component by expanding the Project Objectives and also
      including new VRCC components. This exercise is highly laudable.
     World Bank support during implementation: The World Bank monitored the implementation
      of ETRP by sending its implementation support mission at periodical intervals which helped
      to sort out critical issues involved in the Project. Further, in order to expedite issues referred
      to the Bank by the implementing departments and also to give timely advice, the Bank had
      also placed one of its staff in Chennai itself. These efforts had positive impacts in the
      execution of the Project.
     Non-extension of Project’s Closing date: The World Bank’s last minute decision not to
      extend the Project period beyond 31.12.2011 despite a strong case favoring the extension and
      the positive signals given by the World Bank Officials of India Office for the extension
      deprived the GoTN of any advance action to accommodate the works that may need time
      beyond 31.12.2011and include them under a separate Project with World Bank funding.
     Flexible Procurement Policy: It is a general feeling of the implementing departments that
      further relaxation or at least flexibility (especially in qualification criteria for bidding since
      works are of scattered nature) in the procedures of the World Bank, especially in the matters
      of setting norms for tenders and seeking Bank approvals based on local factors will reduce
      the time element in the execution of works with World Bank funding.

Lessons Learned

36.      The following are the lessons learned during this project implementation:

     Project preparation: In any project involving multiple implementing agencies, the project
      period has to be determined taking into account the needs of substantive training / capacity-
      building on World Bank procedures, particularly procurement, environmental and social
      safeguards, time taken by the World Bank for according no objection for tenders,
      procurement plans, etc., and the reasonable time that may be required to obtain the clearances
      from various Government authorities to commence the projects.
     Project planning: Disaster relief, reconstruction and rehabilitation projects tend to be both
      challenging and complex. In designing such projects, there is a need to build in a more
      realistic timeframe. For each sub-project / activity, the project preparation documents may
      include an activity Gantt chart taking into account possible time delays envisaged in
      finalizing designs, obtaining clearances and procuring contractors.
     Consultant selection: The importance of proper consultant selection / identification cannot be
      under–emphasized. If the consultants do not produce good quality designs / outputs, then
      GoTN and the project suffers substantial delays, e.g. the quality of the DPRs for the Fisheries
      sub-component had to be revised several times before being accepted.
     Procurement: Wherever the projects involve works (electricity, water supply and sewerage)
      to be carried out by other Government agencies (TWAD, TNEB, TNWSSB and ELCOT)
      who have the sole responsibility for these works, the World Bank, if feasible, can consider
      modifying its procedures to permit the state Government’s established practices. It is also to
      be noted that these agencies follow the GoTN’s approved tender acts / rules and cannot adopt


                                                   47
            differing tendering approaches for the small / minor procurement. This may result in
            additional utilization of project funds.
           Implementation priorities: In every project, there are some activities which have a far-
            reaching impact / outcome than others. For example, the in-situ housing strengthening, the
            evacuation shelters and the early warning systems in the VRCC component have the
            potential for such a long-term outcome. These could have been accorded a higher priority in
            both project design and implementation, and given a longer duration for completion, albeit
            there are initial teething problems in their execution.
           General: Many new lessons have been learnt in the response and mitigation efforts. The
            strategies adopted for coordination, empowerment of local officers, the housing
            reconstruction policy and the livelihood and social support measures formulated by GoTN in
            tandem with World Bank have set new trends in rehabilitation and reconstruction areas.
            Guidelines for temporary shelters, Technology Demonstration Units for newer building
            ideas, risk mitigation in the form of insurance etc., are some improvements brought about by
            the programme. The State is now moving forward and better equipped to deal with natural
            disasters. The vulnerability of coastal communities especially fishermen has been reduced.
            Disaster Preparedness and Risk Reduction components have been integrated across different
            sectors combining livelihood and shelter with due care to the environmental factors.

Background

38.    The tsunami of December 2004, caused severe damage to coastal areas of Pondicherry
and Karaikal. At the request of the Government of India, World Bank, Asian Development Bank
and United Nations put together a joint team to assess the socio-economic and environmental
impact of tsunami on the coastal areas of Union Territory of Pondicherry. Based on the
assessment and discussions among the three institutions and GoI, an approach for providing
reconstruction assistance in different sectors was developed. The World Bank agreed to finance
the Emergency Tsunami Reconstruction project in the Union Territory of Pondicherry which
suffered the brunt of tsunami.

39.     The World Bank’s Emergency Tsunami Reconstruction Project (ETRP) was approved on
May 3, 2005 and became effective on August 5, 2005, with a closing date of April 30, 2008. The
project provided support for (i) reconstruction of housing; (ii) revival of livelihoods in fisheries
and agriculture and (iii) capacity building along with technical assistance to implement the
program. The agriculture component under livelihood, being a very small component, was later
dropped from the ETRP project after a mutual agreement with Govt. of Puducherry and the
World Bank

Project Objectives

40.   The Project Development Objective of the Emergency Tsunami Reconstruction Project
(ETRP) was to revive the livelihood and promote recovery in the Tsunami affected areas of
Puducherry and Karaikal. Accordingly the project comprises of the following components:

Component 1: Housing Reconstruction
Component 2: Restoration of Livelihood.
Component 3; Technical Assistance & Training
Component 4: Implementation Support

41.   These objectives were translated into physical and investment targets to be supported by
IDA Credit of 37.958 million USD.

42.     The first restructuring of the project was completed in August 2009 with a target
completion date of December 2010. Pursuant to the restructuring the revised Project
Development Objective is “to revive livelihoods and promote recovery in the tsunami affected
areas in the short term and reduce the vulnerability of coastal communities to a range of natural
hazards such as cyclone, storm surge, flood and tsunami over the longer term. The objectives of
the project remained valid and unchanged, during implementation, except that the relative
emphasis changed in favor of livelihood restoration.

43.    Before re-stated agreement, the project size was Rs. 197 crores and after restructuring, it
was pruned to Rs. 183 cores. However, the amount that was allowed at the time of closure was
only Rs. 61 crores leaving the balance amount of Rs. 122 crores cancelled. The project could


                                                50
have achieved substantial completion (an additional Rs. 63 crores could have been expended by
June 2012) if it was extended by another 6 months as was requested by GoPy and could have
fully spent the amount by December 2012. If it had been a separate project delinking from
Tamilnadu, it could have achieved the substantial progress by June 2012.

44.     The restoration of agriculture though initially considered to be taken up as a project
component was later dropped from the project as the funding was very small amounting to US
$ 1.4 million, as alternate sources of funding were available. All the activities under forests were
also dropped due to the same reason and to simplify the project.

Implementation Arrangements

45.     The project envisaged the implementation responsibilities with the Project
Implementation Agency (PIA) set up exclusively for the project. The PIA headed by a Project
Director comprises of three sections (1) technical- to handle the engineering aspects (2) fisheries
section-focusing non technical interventions and community management and (3) finance – to
handle the finance, accounts and administration of the project. A full time Joint Project Director
was posted with PIA to handle the day to day affairs of the agency.

46.    The PIA was supervised and monitored by a Governing Body headed by the Chief
Secretary and comprising of senior officials of revenue, finance and rehabilitation departments.

47.     It was to be noted that the capacity of PIA had substantially enhanced in program
implementation by the fact that in addition to the ETRP, the PIA is also the nodal agency for all
reconstruction activities in the tsunami affected areas funded under the TRP program, MPLAD
funds and deposit works of other departments. The PIA also handled the funds released under the
Prime Minister’s National Relief Fund (PMNRF) for providing education scholarship and
financial assistance to the children, support to the fisherman and introduction of the universal
health insurance scheme to the tsunami affected communities and areas.

Approach to the Project

48.     The project was conceived more as a program and not as a conventional fully designed
project. The initial scope of fisheries livelihood projects was increased after considering the
views of the target communities and also on the advice of the implementation support teams of
the World Bank. The original / revised credit allocations made by the World Bank from the
beginning to closure of the ETRP are as follows:

[Value of USD existing on the closure date taken uniformly i.e. ` 52/- per USD]

                                                      In SDRs

As per original agreement dt 12.05.2005              2,46,10,000
Re- stated agreement dt 13.08.2009                   2,26,55,000
At closure of project dt (31.12.2011)                   76,50,000



                                                51
49.    The Livelihood project was implemented through 17 contracts out of which 10 were
awarded and the balance 7 to be awarded/ tendered. The total value of the works envisaged under
the ETRP project is Rs. 1047.92 Millions of which the value of contracts awarded was Rs.
629.22 millions only. Of the awarded works, the works to the tune of Rs. 89.22 Millions were
only completed by 31 December 2011, the closing date of the project.

50.     All the contracts were awarded through National Competitive Bidding (NCB) procedure
as stipulated by the procurement guidelines of the Bank.

51.    The project was initially estimated for a three year completion period commencing in
March 2005 to December 2008. The project was extended till December 2010 as substantial
components couldn’t not be tendered out/awarded and was further extended to December 2011.
However substantial progress could be achieved only from December 2010 with the award of
contracts and by the extended credit closing date, majority of the contracts were awarded. The
works had just commenced and were estimated to be completed by September 2012

Achievement of Objectives

Component 1: Housing Reconstruction

52.     The housing reconstruction comprises of two sub-components; 1) In situ housing and 2)
relocation housing. A total of 7,577 houses were constructed in the Union territory of
Pondicherry. Of the total NGOs built 4,303 houses, GoPy built 1,522 and the balance 1,752
houses were brought under the ETRP Project. Within 1,752 houses, 300 houses at Nallavadu are
under relocation housing built through a contractor based construction and the remaining was in
situ (those with huts) where the beneficiaries had taken up construction on their own.

53.     PIA customized the requirements of insitu housing by providing over 10 different options
effected through a beneficiary agreement. The project brought in innovations using the local
ingenuity in design & construction. All the completed houses were very useful during the recent
“THANE CYCLONE? that hit the coast of Puducherry on 30th December 2011. The program
achieved financial inclusion where for the first time the beneficiaries were exposed to the
banking operations and at the time of closure, the beneficiaries are paid through the Electronic
Clearing System (ECS), a remarkable progress by any standard. A key success of the insitu
housing is regularizing the housing titles and providing a legal identity to the land. PIA effected
a diligent social process and audit of the affected communities to enable the insitu beneficiaries
construct within the approved budget.

54.     The PIA’s role between 2005-2009 was primarily to support the NGOs building the
housing reconstruction program. PIA was instrumental in acquisition of the land, beneficiary
identification, preliminary construction activities like filling, social audit, etc. The housing
reconstruction program under ETRP could not be implemented due to social safeguard process
and environmental and procurement aspects of the World Bank were a major constraint. With
NGOs having sufficient funds under their disposal and the immediate priority being providing
shelter for the affected community, the housing reconstruction commenced immediately.



                                                52
55.     Land acquisition itself would have been a problem if ETRP funds were used because of
the social safeguard processes and also the EIA requirements. The intention may be right in
normal course of project implementation, but during emergencies it fails as is the case and
therefore, can there be a separate framework for such emergencies. Hence, the funds under the
ETRP could not be utilized initially which had affected the Insitu housing programme due to
early closure. The beneficiaries of the insitu housing program have been asked to slow down
their activities for want of funds.

Component 2: Fisheries Livelihood Component

56.     The fisheries livelihood component did not commence simultaneously along with the
housing reconstruction. The component was initiated only during the middle of 2008 losing a
crucial 3 years of implementation period. The component comprises of the a) Fisherman Work
Shelters; b) Modernization of Fishing Harbors of Puducherry and Karaikal; c) Fish Markets; d)
Training & Alternative vocation; e) safety system at sea and f) Information & Knowledge Centre.

57.     Sub-components training & alternative vocation, safety at sea system and information &
knowledge centre were dropped from the project due to delays in procurement and the training
institute was dropped as a similar one was established in Karaikal and therefore was not found
necessary.

58.     The other fisheries livelihood components were implemented through 17 contracts with a
total value of Rs. 1047.92 Million. Of the total out of which 10 were awarded and the balance 7
to the awarded/ tendered. The total value of the works envisaged under the ETRP project is Rs.
1047.92 Millions of which the value of contracts awarded was Rs. 629.22 millions only. Of the
awarded works, the works to the tune of Rs. 89.22 Millions were only completed by 31
December 2011, the closing date of the project. Though the implementation schedule was right
in terms of desired impacts, the delays that occurred during the course of implementation made it
unrealistic. The delay in the implementation of the fisheries livelihood component is due to the
following reasons:

   1. Delay in Design Phase

      The initial delays were attributed to the procurement of the consultants for the various
       components of the project. PIA with limited capacities in the initial phases of
       implementation has to seek the advise the Bank on a regular basis resulting in delays.
      The timelines for various activities were not realistic considering the various approvals
       required and were grossly under estimated.
      The design of sub-components of the project had to undergo revision due to the
       conditions laid out by PPCC/MoEF as part of the environmental clearance process. The
       consultants failed to understand the requirements of the regulatory agencies in the initial
       phase of the project.
      Some sub-components had to undergo revision during the design stage to accommodate
       the advice of the experts of the World Bank. The experts of the World Bank introduced
       new concepts even after the documentation of stakeholders views viz., work shelters
       leading to several iterations and resultant delay.

                                               53
   New components were added during the course of the study after stakeholder
    consultations resulting in increased scope and delay. This could have been avoided if
    these were envisaged at the project design stage itself.
   Majority of the project components being located in Coastal Regulation Zone required
    environmental clearances from Ministry of Environment & Forests (MoEF). The process
    of obtaining the environmental clearances was delayed due to a series of technical and
    environmental studies carried out on the advice of the regulatory agencies, which took
    additional time than was initially envisaged

2. Delay in Procurement of Contractors

   The award of contracts took more time than was envisaged due to poor response from the
    contractors in spite of the best efforts of PIA.
   The contracts for Karaikal could not be awarded due to very poor response from the
    contractors in spite of calling re-bids and lowering the criteria for qualification.
   Delays were also caused for about three months due to assembly elections in April-May
    2011, scrutiny, selection and final award of contracts.
   The technical criteria set out in the tender document also posed a hurdle in obtaining
    good response from the bidders. Though, PIA to provide chance to the local bidders and
    to enhance the competition, decided on low qualification criteria, the project did not elicit
    a good response. In spite of meetings with the bidder community and wide spread
    advertisement, the response was poor that led to second call for a number of projects and
    even third call for some projects. The bidders also lacked experience on the
    implementation of environmental management measures as suggested in the tender
    documents and hence did not bid at all. Going by the response received it may be
    construed that bifurcation into small packages had not yielded the desired results. This
    may warrant a re-look at the procurement process in structuring the bid packages to elicit
    response from bidders who are experienced with similar projects.
   The lack of experience of small contractors in implementing the EMP measures
    suggested in the bid documents is also a reason for poor response as they had stayed
    away from bidding thus defeating the very purpose of inclusiveness and competition.
   Another reason for delay is the commencement of fisheries livelihood projects. They
    have not commenced in tandem with housing reconstruction and were initiated only 2008,
    halfway of the project. On hindsight, it may be concluded that if the design of fisheries
    livelihood components commenced along with the housing component, substantial
    progress would have been achieved on the overall project. Some of the components
    would have been completed by now which would have shown the desired results.
   Further the packages under livelihood project have been split-up in to a staggering
    number of seventeen, which could have been reasonably and prudently, too, grouped
    under SIX to EIGHT only so that the major contractors / enterprises in the nation would
    have been attracted to the participation, considering the big value.




                                             54
3.     Assessment of Outcome

59.    The overall outcome of the ETRP with regard to fisheries livelihoods is not satisfactory,
in the context that the envisaged interventions were not completed and the objective of
improving livelihood opportunities to intended beneficiaries could not be achieved within a
reasonable period

Component 3: Technical Assistance & Training

60.     The technical assistance to PIA for the fisheries component was provided in the form of
Service Consultants and Project Management Consultant. The Service Consultants were
appointed only by April 2009. The appointment of Project Management Consultant was done
much later only by December 2010. Thus the preparations of Detailed Project Reports for sub-
components were substantially delayed and could be completed only by September 2010, which
could have otherwise been completed earlier. Consequently, the procurement of contractors also
got delayed and at the time of credit closure, the PIA could achieve good progress on the
procurement. As the projects had just commenced at the time of closure, the objectives were not
realized. However, on completion of the projects, the affected community would definitely
realize the benefits of the proposed interventions. Hence, an impact study, if undertaken post
completion of projects would provide an insight on the benefits accrued from project
interventions.

61.    The training component comprised of (i) fisheries training institute and (ii) capacity
building of PIA staff. The former was dropped from the project. For the latter, it was originally
intended that PIA would increase the manpower of its technical wing and gradually take over the
supervision from the Service Consultants after obtaining the necessary training, which was also
within the scope of the Service Consultants. However, with construction activities just
commencing and sudden closure of the project, building the capacities of technical wing of PIA
could not be achieved.
Objective 4: Implementation Support

62.     The implementation support was largely in staffing the PIA and maintains the
establishment and office administration. On the overall, PIA established itself as an agency that
can handle similar projects.

Bank Performance

63.     The project was conceived to provide housing, revive the livelihoods and promote
recovery in tsunami affected areas. The initial assessment generated considerable attention from
the Govt. of Pondicherry which helped develop consensus on approach to project preparation.
The Project Preparation took place between January–April 2005 and the agreement was inked in
May 2005. The Bank team comprises of multi-disciplinary experts (social development,
infrastructure, environment, fisheries, finance, procurement, etc.). The implementation support
missions worked with the borrower team to evolve the project design and paid adequate attention
to technical, financial, economic and institutional aspects. The Operational Manual which was
developed under ETRP was utilized beyond ETRP.


                                               55
64.    Bank performance in supervision of project implementation was satisfactory. Ten
implementation support missions through their extensive field visits, discussions with
implementation agency, line departments, project beneficiaries, and secretaries of Government
departments, helped in effecting a coordinated mechanism to achieve the project objectives
though to a limited extent.

65.     The approval process from the Bank was too cumbersome. PIA had to take the
advice/approval of the Bank at each and every stage. The procurement of the consultants and the
approval process which itself went for more than a year warrants a better mechanism. The
Bank’s focus should also be on the tangible physical assets which was very less. Though the
processes are equally important but in this kind of a scenario, where time is the essence, a
different framework needs to be in place. The procurement through the Bank’s processes was
real stumbling block when it was most needed. The bank was non committal on the extension /
closure of the project. It was a major let down with no reliable communication. Had the bank
provided some indication about the impending closure, which in the Borrower’s view is not a
closely - guarded secret it would have helped the latter evolve suitable strategy / planning
besides avoiding the sudden- departure - impact on the project scenario.

66.     However it could now be said with hindsight that the project did not provide adequate
attention to the capacity building of PIA, design considerations, stakeholders’ views and
environmental considerations of the project. The latter two resulted in re-working of the sub-
components that resulted in delays thereby delaying the overall project.

Borrower Performance

67.     The input of PIA in identifying, preparing and appraising the projects was satisfactory.
Government too by regularly convening interdepartmental meetings demonstrated its will to
pursue the project objectives. The performance of PIA during implementation can be rated
satisfactory. Though PIA as the implementation agency could provide inputs during project
preparation, but was weak in procurement process and environmental aspects due to the absence
of specialists. The appointment of a Project Management Consultant (PMC) to PIA put in place
from December 2010 streamlined the implementation process.

68.    The financial management of PIA was highly satisfactory and was reporting on a regular
basis to the Bank with regards to financial aspects. The internal controls, particularly with
regards to in-situ housing were very good. The PIA gained experience on double entry
accounting, which was never followed earlier. The handling this project came in handy to PIA to
manage other projects as well, establishing the capacity building PIA gained through this project.
PIA maintained highly satisfactory record of procurement which formed basis for review of
physical and financial progress by Bank supervision missions. PIA in consultation with their
consultants prepared yearly and quarterly work programs and further translated it into monthly
expenditure targets. PIA convened monthly review meetings with the consultants and contractors
to ensure smooth progress and also compared the progress vis-a-vis the targets.

Future Operations

69.    The project was being implemented through 18 contracts (across 4 components), out of
which 11 have been awarded and 7 yet to be awarded. Only relocation housing reached a certain
level of completion and it is estimated that all the contracts would be completed only by
September 2012.

70.     Of the awarded works to the tune of Rs. 629.22 Millions, the work that was completed by
31 December 2011 was only Rs.81.5 Millions i.e.13% of the awarded works. With regards to the
total project cost, it was still lower and was only 8% of the total envisaged works. Hence, It
would not be possible to finance the full completion of the project unless additional support was
extended to PIA. However, appropriate institutional mechanisms were evolved for operations
and maintenance of the assets created under the project but could not be put in place as the
projects were just grounded and are yet to be completed.

Key Lessons Learnt

   1. Activities Completed: For the activities completed, such as in-situ housing reconstruction
      and relocation housing – the objectives were achieved, which was felt during “Thane
      Cyclone?. This brings to the fore the importance of project planning.

   2. For activities that are yet to be completed, it was difficult to ascertain the lessons learnt
      due to early closure.

   3. Procurement: The procurement process brought in good practices and total transparency
      though they were time consuming. The procurement of consultants should be balanced
      evenly for the design phase and construction supervision phase, which was otherwise
      now with heavily loaded for the design phase with no tangible results on ground.

   4. Awareness on the importance of Environmental Management Plan: The project brought
      in better insight on the environmental process, which was completely lacking with PIA.

   5. Sustainability and economic viability. The proposed components will have far reaching
      effect on the livelihoods of the affected communities. The interventions proposed would
      facilitate sustainable livelihood opportunities thereby enhancing the local economic
      development. The economic viability of the operations of the fishing community which
      was in question in the post tsunami era would enhance greatly once the proposed projects
      are implemented completely.

                            Annex 11: Additional Lessons Learned

The following are the additional lessons learned in relation to specific ETRP components.

Urban housing component
 In-situ resettlement in an urban context is difficult, sensitive, and time consuming. As
   evidenced in ETRP, this is the case due to multiple factors that include providing transit
   shelters, unwillingness on the part of beneficiaries for temporary resettlement/relocation, lack
   of trust between the beneficiaries and the implementation agency, uncertainty about the
   completion of the scheme, and the need for a consensus in community decision-making.
   Thorough preparation, substantive human resource capacity to address implementation
   challenges and strong Government commitment are necessary to realize the desired
   development outcomes.
 Use of biometric cards for identifying beneficiaries needs to be institutionalized. For the
   first time in Tamil Nadu, the use of biometric cards for the beneficiaries was introduced.
   Though there were implementation difficulties, the systems for issuing these cards were
   streamlined. Similar approaches can be adopted in other similar projects as well. The cards
   reduce incidences of the same beneficiary obtaining assistance twice or in two different
   schemes within the same state.
 Transit shelters should be avoided. ETRP experience has revealed that providing transit
   shelters creates a wide range of problems. These include (a) uncertainties involved in terms
   of the timing for shifting to the permanent location, (b) being able to provide only a very
   small space and inadequate amenities due to land availability constraints, (c) day-to-day
   difficulties in managing these transit shelters, and (d) huge costs associated with their
   maintenance, and (e) difficulties associated with decommissioning / demolishing the transit
   shelters. Providing rental assistance, as an alternative to transit shelters would be a preferable
   that was used in rural housing in VRCC.

Rural housing reconstruction
 Use of third party quality auditing should be made mandatory. Regular third party technical
   auditing of various construction activities has resulted in better construction quality.
   Following the ETRP experience, this practice has been extended to other Government
   schemes as well.
