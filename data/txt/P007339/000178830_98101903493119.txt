SUMMARY
i.        The Empresa Nacional de Energia Electrica (ENEE) asked the Bank
Group to assist in financing a power project which forms the major part of
ENEE's expansion program for the five-year period 1967-1971. The total
estimated cost of the program is $25.5 million. The estimated cost of the
proposed Project is $17.7 miliion of which $11.5 million would be required
in foreign currency. It is recommended that the Bank and IDA provide the
Republic of Honduras with respectively a loan of $7.5 million and a devel-
opment credit of $4.0 million and that the Government relend the total pro-
ceeds of $11.5 million to ENEE to cover the foreign currency costs of the
Project.
ii.       The Project would consist., of: (a) the construction of the 40 Mw
Rio Lindo Hydroelectric Scheme; (b) the expansion of ENEE's transmission
system; and (c) feasibility studies of future hydroelectric development.
iii.      The Project is needed to meet the growing demand for power on
ENEE's main system and is the most economic of alternative means of meeting
this demand. It is technically sound, the estimated cost and the construc-
tion schedules are realistic, and arrangements for engineering and the super-
vision of construction are satisfactory.
iv.       ENEE is an autonomous government corporation responsible for pro-
moting the electric power development of Honduras. Its organization and
management, although recently improved, still need strengthening. Steps
now being taken should rectify the situation.
V.        ENEE's financial position is sound and is expected to remain so.
vi.       The Bank made a loan of $1.45 million in 1959 and another loan
of $8.8 million in 1960 to ENEE for the expansion of its facilities. The
projects financed by these loans have been successfully completed.
vii.      The Project would be suitable for a loan of $11.5 million equiv-
alent for a term of 25 years including a grace period of three and a half
years to be provided to ENEE by the Government of Honduras out of the pro-
ceeds of the proposed Bank loan of $7.5 million and the proposed IDA credit
of $h.O million mentioned above.

1. INTRODUCTION
1.01      This report covers the appraisal of a power project which the
Empresa Nacional de Energia Electrica (ENEE) has requested the Bank Group
to assist in financing. The Project would be the major part of ENEE's
expansion program for the five-year period 1967-1971. The total cost of
the program has been estimated at $25.5 million, of which the Project
would account for $17.7 million with foreign currency requirements of
$s1.5 million.
1.02      It is recommended that the Bank and IDA provide the Republic of
Honduras with respectively a loan of $7.5 million and a development credit
of $4.0 million and that the Government relend the proceeds to ENEE to cover
the foreign currency costs of the Project.
1.03      The Bank made a loan of $1.45 million (Loan No. 226-HO) to ENEE
in 1959 for the provision of 2.5 Mw of diesel generating capacity and for
the improvement of distribution facilities. In 1960 it made another loan
of $8.8 million (Loan No. 261-HO) for the first stage of the Lake Yojoa-
Rio Lindo development (the 30 Mw Canaveral Hydroelectric Scheme) and for
associated transmission. Both projects have been successfully completed.
1.04      This report is based on a feasibility report prepared by ENEE's
Consultants, Harza Engineering Company International, and dated May 1967
and on findings by a Bank mission comprising Messrs. Hui Huang and Carel
de Beaufort which visited Honduras in September-October 1967.
2. ELECTRICITY SUPPLY IN HONDURAS
2.01      The total electric power capacity for Honduras is about 73 Mw of
which ENEE's share is about 64%. ENEE is thus the chief electricity supply
authority in Honduras. It operates hydro and diesel plants with a total
installed capacity of about 47 Mw. Two private companies, the Standard
Fruit Company and the Tela Railroad Company, also supply electric power to
several towns in their areas of operation. The combined capacity of their
power plants is about 10 Mw. Several municipalities own small diesel plants
with a total capacity of about 2 Mw. The capacity of captive power plants
belonging to industrial undertakings aggregates about 14 Mw.
2.02      Total electricity production in Honduras in 1966 was about 204
million kwh.  For an estimated population of 2,363,000 this represents a
per capita annual production of 86 kwh only, the lowest in Central America.-
1/ Per capita kwh production in Central America in 1964 was as follows:
Costa Rica 421; Nicaragua 168; El Salvador 133; Guatemala 111;
Honduras 59; and Central America 149.

3. EMPRESA NACIONAL DE ENERGIA ELECTRICA
3.01      The Empresa Nacional de Energia Electrica (ENEE) was established
by law in 1957 as an autonomous authority wholly owned by the Government
responsible for promoting the electrical power development of the country.
3.02      ENEE is governed by a Board of Directors composed of five members;
namely, the Minister of Communications and Public Works, as Chairman, the
Minister of National Resources, and representatives of the National Economic
Planning Council, the Development Department of the National Development Bank
and the National Chamber of Commerce and Industry. The two ministers are
appointed ex-officio; the representatives of the National Economic Planning
Council and the National Development Bank are designated by the respective
agencies; and the representative of the National Chamber of Commerce and
Industry is designated by the Minister of Economy and Finance from a list
of three candidates reconmended by the Chamber. The term of office of the
three representatives is three years and they are eligible for reappointment.
A General Manager, appointed by the Board, is responsible for all managerial
and administrative functions. The present General Manager, a civil engineer,
although lacking in utility experience when appointed in October 1965, has
proved to be a good administrator. ENEE has agreed to carry out its func-
tions under the direction of a qualified and experienced General Manager
mutually satisfactory to ENEE, the Bank and IDA. This is similar to a pro-
vision in the 261-HO Loan Agreement.
3.03      The Law governing ENEE's operations is generally acceptable.
During the negotiations for the proposed Bank/IDA financing, the Honduran
delegation confirmed that ENEE has authority to establish power tariffs.
Although the basis for determining tariffs is not stipulated in the Law,
a rate covenant will be included in the proposed agreements (paragraph 7.02)
and this arrangement would be satisfactory.
3.04      Initially ENEE's operations were unsatisfactory but since the
completion of the Canaveral Project in April 1964 the situation has greatly
improved. However, ENEE's organization and management still need to be
strengthened, especially in view of the large expansion program now to
be undertaken. In particular the engineering staff should be reinforced.
At the suggestion of the Bank, ENEE has recently engaged at its own expense
a firm of management consultants acceptable to the Bank (R. W. Beck and
Associates of Seattle) to make a study of its organization and operation
procedures and to make recommendations for improvements. The terms of
reference for the study have been approved by the Bank. The Consultants'
report and recommendations are expected in July 1968. It has been agreed
that the report will be sent to the Bank and IDA for review and that the
Bank, IDA and ENEE will then agree on which of the recommendations should
be implemented and decide on a program and timetable for the implementation.
If necessary, such implementation will be assisted by the Consultants.

Facilites of ENEE
3-05      ENEE's main transmission system (the interconnected system) serves
the country's most highly populated and important zone which extends from the
capital city of Tegucigalpa to Puerto Cortes in the north (see Map 1). The
system consists of about 229 km of 138 kv lines, 50 km of 69 kv lines and
58 km of 34.5 kv lines. ENEE also supplies small towns, not connected to
the interconnected system, by diesel generating plants.
3.06      The effective generating capacity of the interconnected system is
about 44 Mw. This will be increased to 54 Mw by May 1968 when plant now
under construction is put into operation. The generating facilities consist
of:
Hydroelectric Plants                        Mw
Canaveral                                   30

Puerto Cortes                                1.3
22.0
1/ 10 Mw under construction
The combined capacity of diesel plants supplying small towns is 3 Mw.
3.07      All ENEE's systems operate at 60 cycles.  The generating plants
and transmission and distribution facilities are generally well operated
and maintained. Operating costs (including fuel costs) in 1966 were about
1.3 U.S. cents per kwh sold, which is reasonable for systems such as ENEE's.
To compensate for higher operating costs in the small tomns supplied by
diesel plants the tariff charged is about 18% higher than the interconnected
system tariff.
4. EXPANSION PROGRAM
4.01      ENEE has an expansion program for the five-year period 1967 through
1971 to meet increasing power demand. The main work would be the Project pro-
posed for Bank and IDA financing and would consist of: (a) the construction
of the Rio Lindo Hydroelectric Scheme with an initial installation of 40 Mw,
(b) the expansion of transmission system and (c) the provision of engineering
services for the study of hydroelectric sources and the preparation of a fea-
sibility report for future development. Other works include the installation



of additional diesel generating capacity and other transmission and distri-
bution system expansion. The program is considered reasonable and suitable
to meet the needs.
4.02      In the financial forecasts the following provisions for capital
expenditures during the five-year period have been made:

5. THE PROJECT
Description of Project
5.01      The Rio Lindo Hydroelectric Scheme would be the second stage of
Lake Yojoa-Rio Lindo Development (see Map 2). It would utilize the total
available head of about 400 meters between Canaveral, the first stage of
development, and the Sula Valley. The main storage reservoir for both
stages would be Lake Yojoa. Although a third 15 Mw generating unit could be
installed at Canaveral, such a unit would not be useful at the present time
as it could only be used for peaking purposes since nearly all available
water is being utilized, whereas the Rio Lindo Scheme with an initial in-
stalled capacity of h0 Mw would have an energy capability of about 313 Gwh,
corresponding to an annual plant factor of nearly 90%. Water discharged
from the Canaveral Scheme would be conducted through a steel pipeline, about
1,370 m long, then through a tunnel, about 900 m long, to a regulating res-
ervoir. This reservoir would be formed by an earth dike about 20 m high
and 200 m in length. It would have a capacity of about 750,000 m3 and would
be used for daily regulation. A short tunnel and a steel penstock about
5,110 m long would bring water from the regulating reservoir to a power
station situated near the village of Rio Iindo. The station would be de-
signed for remote control from the Canaveral Power Station. Water dis-
charged from the power station would flow through an open canal to the
Rio Lindo. Initially two generating units, each of 20 Mw capacity, would
be installed. Each unit would consist of a vertical shaft hydraulic tur-
bine of the h-jet impulse type directly coupled to a three-phase 60-cycle
alternator.  Two additional 20 IMw units would-be installed at a later date.



The installation of these units and the diversion of water from the Rio
Lindo into the Scheme (see Map 2) would only increase energy output by
about 20%, and the units would therefore be used chiefly for peaking pur-
poses.
5.02      The expansion of the transmission system would include:
(a). the construction of a double-circuit 138 kv transmission line,
about 2 km long, to connect the Rio Lindo Power Station to the
interconnected system;
(b) the construction of a single-circuit 138 kv transmission line,
about 53 km long, from the Rio Lindo Power Station to San Pedro
Sula and the expansion of the substation at San Pedro Sula;
(c) the reconstruction of the single-circuit 69 kv transmission
line, about 12 km long, from Bufalo to La Lima, the construction
of a similar line, about 20 km long, from La Lima to El Progreso
and the construction of associated substations.
5.03      Honduras has a number of water resources which could be developed
to provide hydroelectric power, probably more than in any other Central
American country. ENEE engaged consultants (Harza) to conduct a survey of
hydroelectric potential in western Honduras and their report of May 1967
recommends five sources, all reasonably close to the interconnected system,
with outputs ranging in size from 60 Mw to 280 Mw, for further consideration.
Since a detailed study of these sources will take some time and since con-
struction of another hydroelectric scheme would probably have to be com-
menced in 1972 in order to have it completed by 1975 (see paragraph 6.08)
it is recommended that funds to cover the foreign currency costs of such a
study be included in the proposed ProJect.
Engineering
5.04      The Rio Lindo Scheme is being designed by ENEE's Consultants,
the Harza Engineering Company International, who were responsible for the
design and supervision of construction of the Canaveral Hydroelectric
Scheme. Harza will be responsible for the supervision of construction of
the Rio Lindo Scheme. Harza will also be responsible for the design of
the 138 kv transmission lines and substations and will assist ENEE in
supervising their construction. The work on the 69 kv transmission lines
and substations will be handled by ENEEVs own staff which has experience
in this field.
5.05      For the feasibility studies on future hydroelectric development
ENEE will engage consultants acceptable to the Bank and IDA to carry out
the work on terms and conditions satisfactory to the Bank and IDA. The
consultants will be selected before October 1968.



- 6-
Procurement and Disbursement
5.06      All contracts except those for engineering services (paragraph 5.05)
will be awarded on the basis of international competitive bidding. The basis
of disbursements will be the foreign currency costs of imported equipment and
services only. Expenditures prior to the date of the loan will not be eli-
gible for reimbursement and if savings are made any excess loan funds will
be available for cancellation.
Construction Schedules
5.07      Detailed design work by the Consultants is well advanced.   Most
of the specifications and tender documents have been prepared and approved
by the Bank and IDA. Major tenders on equipment and civil works have been
invited. Contracts for generating plant, the delivery of which could be the
controlling factor on the commissioning date, are expected to be awarded by
June 1968 and contracts for civil works by September 1968. The station is
scheduled to be commissioned by the end of 1970. The transmission lines
and the substations are expected to be completed before that time. Fea-
sibility studies on future hydroelectric development are also expected to
be completed by the end of 1970. These schedules are realistic.
Estimated Cost
5.08      The total estimated cost of the proposed Project is L35.5 million
($17.7 million). The estimated foreign exchange cost is L23.0 million
($11.5 million). Detailed cost estimates, mainly prepared by the Consultants,
are shown in Annex 1. A summary of the cost estimates is as follows:

-7-
5.09      The cost estimates for civil works and transmission lines are
based on the cost of works of a similar nature recently completed in Honduras
and El Salvador and on the Canaveral Project costs. Prices for generating
plant and electrical equipment are based on preliminary quotations from man-
ufacturers. An allowance of about 15% has been included for contingencies
to cover unforeseen construction difficulties and for price escalation during
the construction period. The cost estimates are reasonable and the allowance
for contingencies and price escalation should be adequate.
5.10      The estimated cost of the Rio Lindo Scheme, excluding interest
during construction, is L30 million ($15 million)l/ which is equal to a
unit cost of $375 per kw installed. This may appear high but as the energy
capability of the scheme is very high (90% plant factor) and the second
stage, consisting of the installation of two 20 Mw generating units and the
diversion of additional water into the scheme, is estimated to cost only
L19 million ($9.5 million), it is reasonable. The total estimated cost of
stages one and two, with an installed capacity of 80 Mw, is L49 million
($24.5 million) which would be equal to a unit cost of $306 per kw installed
which is reasonable for the type of scheme. The estimated cost of energy
produced by the first stage of the scheme is 4.7 U.S. mills per kwh, which
is low-cost power.
6. JUSTIFICATION FOR PROJECT
Power Market
6.01      ENEE's service area can be divided into four groups: The Central
District, The Northern District, The Southern District and the "Isolated
Systems." The Central and Northern Districts are supplied by the inter-
connected system with which the proposed Project would be concerned. The
Central District comprises Tegucigalpa and the towns of Comayagua and
Siguatepeque in the Comayagua Valley. The Northern District includes San
Pedro Sula (the second largest city and the most industrialized area), the
Caribbean port of Puerto Cortes and the towns of La Lima and El Progreso.
The country's two largest industrial undertakings, the Mochito silver mines
and a cement factory, are in the Northern District. The Southern District
consists of the towns of Choluteca and Nacaome and the Pacific port of San
Lorenzo, which are presently supplied by diesel planta but which by 1974
would be linked by transmission lines to the interconnected system. Under
Isolated Systems are eight small towns which are supplied by diesel gener-
ating plants.
6.02      Energy sales by ENEE before the completion of the Canaveral Project
in April 1964 were low because the system capacity was not adequate to meet
all the potential power demands and both the Mochito mines and the cement
factory had to depend on their own diesel installations. Sales in 1964 were
94% higher than in 1963 following the completion of Canaveral and a tariff

reduction (see paragraph 7.01) which stimulated consumption.  A large part
of this increase was in sales to the two industries mentioned. The average
rate of increase in the two following years 1965 and 1966 was 30.6% per
annum for ENEE as a whole; 16.6% for the Central District; and 40.8% for the
Northern District. This very high rate in the latter district was due to
considerable economic activity in the prosperous San Pedro Sula area and
increased consumption by Mochito mines and the cement factory. ENEE has
only recently taken over supply of the three towns in the Southern District
and a record of past sales is not available. Sales to the eight small towns
comprising the Isolated Systems increased at an average rate of 17.9% per
annum.
6.03      In 1966 ENEE's total sales i-were 117 million kwh of which the
Central District accounted for 35%, the Northern District 62% and the
Southern District and Isolated Systems 3%. The following table shows a
percentage breakdowm of sales into categories and the number of consumers
in each category:
Percent of Total Sales No. of Consumers
Residential                             21                27,0h3
Commercial                              16                 2,052

6.o4      Annexes 2 and 3 show actual sales for the period 1963 through 1966
and ENEE's forecast of sales for the years 1967 through 1977. Because of the
sharp changes in the rate of increase in sales in recent years (see paragraph
6.02), it is not meaningful to extrapolate past trends. Thus the forecast
for 1967-1971 is based on information supplied by major industries and on
what can be learned from past movements. The forecast is considered rea-
sonable and has been used as the basis for the financial projections. 1/
The forecast for the period from 1972 through 1977 must be regarded as ten-
tative and has only been used as a basis for system planning.
6.05      Total sales by ENEE are estimated to increase at an average rate
of 19.9% during the period 1967 through 1971 and at an average rate of 10.6%
per annum during 1972 through 1977.
1/ Even if sales during the next two years fall short of the forecast
by as much as 10%, the proposed Project would still be required by
the end of 1970 to enable system load to be met, and the adverse
effect on the financial projections would be small.



- 9 -
6.06      Sales in the Central District are expected to increase at an
average rate per amnum of 15.9% during 1967 through 1971 and ll.9% during
1972 through 1977. In the Northern District sales are expected to increase
at an average rate per annum of 18.1% and 11.8% respectively for the two
periods, a much lower rate of increase than for the past two years. ENEE
has recently taken over the utilities at San Lorenzo, Choluteca and Nacaome
in the Southern District, and has increased generating capacity with funds
provided by the Government. A number of new factories are being established
in the area and energy sales are expected to increase from 1.2 million kwh
in 1966 to 20.3 million kwh in 1971 at an average rate per annum of 76%.
6.07      The maximum demand on ENEE's interconnected system increased
from 15.4 MT in 1964 to 24.1 Mw during 1966 with a fairly high annual load
factor of around 60%. The present demand is about 31 Mw. A forecast of
system demand, based on the sales forecast, is shown in Annex 4. The demand
is expected to grow to 55.8 Mw in 1971 representing an average increase per
annum of 18.3% and to reach 114 Mw by 1977. The combined maximum demand of
the Southern District and the Isolated Systems is presently about 1.6 Mw.
This is expected to grow to about 6.5 Mw by 1971.
Installation Program to Meet Expected Load Growth
6.08      To meet the expected increase in demand on the interconnected
system during the 1967-1971 period and through 1977 ENEE plans to install
additional genere-ting capacity as shown in Annex 5. Four diesel generating
units with a total capacity of 10 Mw will be inzalled at Teaucigalpa by
May 1968. The units are being financed by a lo:nn from the Central American
Bank for Economic Integration (CABEI). The installation of these uinits is
an interim measure to enable demand to be met prior to the completion in
1970 of the Rio Lindo Scheme which with its first two 20 Mw units forms part
of the proposed Project.  Additional peaking ca--.:.ity is explicted to be re-
quired by 1974 and this would be met by the insta2lation of a third 15 Mw
unit at the Canaveral Hydroelectric Plant.  By 1975 another a'hi tion will
probably be required to provide additional energy as well as ataditional
peaking capacity and it has been assumed that a new hydroelectric scheme
with an initial capacity of 30 Mw would be in commission by this date.
6.09      To meet increasing demands on the Southern District and the
Isolated Systems during the period 1967 through 1971 ENEE plans to install
about 5 Mw of diesel generating plant in various localities. This would
bring the total installed capacity to about 8 Mw.
6.10      The transmission line from the Rio Lindo Power Station to San
Pedro Sula will ensure more reliable power supply to this important area
and will also be required to meet its futuro load growth. Reconstruction
of the existing transmission line from Bufalo to La Lima will enable ENEE



- 10 -
to supply the headquarters of the Tela Railroad Company at La Lima, which
is presently supplied by the companiy's 3.3 Mw diesel plant, with more eco-
nomical power from ENEE's main system.  Extension of the line to El Progreso
will enable ENEE to provide service to this important municipality.
Choice between Hydro and Thermal Generating Capacity
6.11      Various alternative programs to meet the forecast power demand
were investigated by ENEE and its Consultants. These included hydro and
thermal generating stations. The proposed Rio Lindo Scheme as now recom-
mended by Harza was found to be by far the most economic of the alternatives.
The rate of. return on the incremental investment 1/ in-the-'Rio-'Lindo'Sche'm'e
over a thermal alternative is about 16%, assuming a price of US$2.25 per
barrel excluding taxes for heavy fuel oil. At a price of $1.75 per barrel
the corresponding return is about 14%. Heavy fuel oil is not marketed in
Honduras at this time but $2.25 per barrel is considered a reasonable price
at Puerto Cortes where the alternative thermal station would be located.
7. FINANCIAL ASPECTS
Tariffs
7.01      When the Bank's previous loan was made in 1960 the tariffs were
at a high level which discouraged the use of energy. New tariffs providing
for a reduction of about 30% were recommended by a consulting firm and were
put into effect in 1964. Since then the tariffs have remained unchanged and
the average revenue per kwh sold is now about 7.3 ceintavos (US 3.65 cents).
At this level ENEE is obtaining a satisfactory return on plant in operation
(paragraph 7.14). In order to enable ENEE to make an acceptable contribution
towards the financing of the Project the tariffs should not be reduced during
the construction period. During this period ENEE is expected to make an
average return on plant in operation of more than 11% per year which is
needed in view of its rapid growth. In the long run, however, a minimum
return of 10% per year should provide ENEE with a satisfactory level of
cash generation.
1/ This is the discount rate which equalizes the streams of capital
and operating costs for the Rio Lindo and thermal alternatives.



- 11 -
7.02      In view of the reasons given in the previous paragraph assurances
have been obtained that except with the approval of the Bank and IDA:
(a) ENEE's annual return on average net fixed assets in
operation shall not be less than 10%, and
(b) the tariffs will be maintained at their present
level during the construction period of the
Project.
It has also been agreed that upon the completion of the Project the rate of
return would be reconsidered in order to determine whether a reduction would
then be appropriate.

7.04      ENEE's financial position is sound having improved considerably
during the last three years. In 1963 EIEE had to face unexpected increases In
construction costs, and was forced to drau down its cash balances and obtained
with the Bank's approval a loan of L2 million from the Banco Central de
Honduras. As a result the ratio of long-term debt to equity which under the
terms of the Bank's previous loan agreements was not to exceed 2 to 1, rose to
2.4 to 1. This situation was rectified during 1965 and 1966, mainly by the
addition of undistributed income to ENIEE's equity. On December 31, 1967 the
ratio stood at 1.24 to 1. As explained in paragraph 7.24 the test is no longer
suitable and should therefore be replaced by a debt service test.
7.05      Another result of the improvement noted in the previous paragraph
was the transformation of a negative working capital of L2 million at the end
of 1964 into a positive position of LI.7 million at the end of 1967 with a
current ratio of 1.36 to 1.
7.o6      During the five years ending December 31, 1967, ENEE's capital
increased from L8.6 million to L21.8 million, primarily as a result of un-
distributed net income totaling L11.4 million and Government contributions
totaling L1.7 million. Since 1961 (just prior to placing the L32 million
Canaveral plant into operation) gross Utility Plant rose from L8.3 million
to L54.6 million, an increase of 558%.
7.07      At the end of 1967 the two Bank loans, 226-HO and 261-HO, represented
65% of the outstanding long-term debt. Loan 226-HO was made for $1,450,000 in
1959 for a term of 15 years and at an interest rate of 6% to finance the ex-
pansion of distribution and generating facilities in the Tegucigalpa area.
Loan 261-HO was made for $8,800,000 in 1960 for a term of 25 years and at an
interest rate of 6% to finance the Canaveral project. This project was also
financed by an AID loan made for L5.6 million ($2.8 million) at an interest
rate of 3.5% and for a term of 25 years.
7.o8      The bonds which at the end of 1967 were outstanding in the amount of
L3.8 million were issued in 1964 and 1965. Their interest rate is 7% and they
are to be amortized in semi-annual installments during the period 1967 through
1976. The Banco Central de Honduras which placed the bonds and guarantees
their debt service, charges a commission of 1% per annum on the amount of bonds
outstanding excluding those it is holding for its own account.
7.09      Substantially the rest of the long-term debt consists of the following
two loans which were obtained to finance the acquisition of electrical systems:
Interest     Final       Amount       System
Creditor                        Rate     Maturity     Lempiras    Financed
Banco Central de Honduras        7%        1975        162,000     Choluteca
Tela Railroad Company            6%        1970         78,ooo     Puerto Cortes



- 13 -
Auditors
7.10      The financial statements of ENEE are audited by Price Waterhouse
and Co., Guatemala. ENEE has agreed that its accounts will continue to be audited
by a firm of accountants acceptable to the Bank and IDA, and that it will
transmit the accountant's report to the Bank and IDA within four months after
the end of each financial year.
Earnings Record
7.11      Income statements for the five-year period 1963 through 1967 are
included in Annex 7.
7.12      Following the substantial reduction in tariffs made in 1964 and the
coming into operation of the Canaveral plant soon thereafter, sales of energy
increased at exceptionally high rates which reached a peak in 1964 with an
increase in that year of 94%. Since the higher sales volume more than com-
pensated for the reduction in tariffs, revenues also showed a substantial
increase.
7.13      As was to be expected, the gains in revenue flowed only partly
through to net income. As a result of the growth in plant and in spite of
savings in fuel costs, maintenance and operating expenses show substantial
increases. Because of the growth in long-term debt there were also important
increases in interest.
7.14      On balance annual net income rose from L1.7 million in 1963 to L3.8
million in 1967. Since no distribution was made to the Government the profits
contributed in a satisfactory manner towards the building up of ENEE's equity.
Because of the coming into service of the Canaveral plant return on average
net plant in operation declined sharply from 19.4% in 1962 to 6.9% in 1964.
Thereafter as sales increased and since the plant increased only moderately,
the return improved to 12.8% in 1967.
Financing Plan (1967-1971 Program)
7.15      In addition to the Rio Lindo project the 1967-1971 construction
program includes the installation of diesel units with a capacity of 10 Mw,
expansion of the distribution system and the electrification of the Southern
District. Towards the latter, the Government already made a capital contri-
bution in 1966 of L1.4 million which is being spent during 1967 and 1968.
Provisions for increases in working capital and an expected cash surplus
total L3.4 million. The applications of funds during the five-year period
1969 through 1971 may be summarized as follows:

ENEE plans to finance these requirements in the following manner:

The Sources and Applications of Funds Statement for the years 1967 through 1971
is shown in more detail in Annex 8.
7.16      Internal cash generation, net of debt service, would finance 31.7%
of the application of funds. This percentage is not high but in view of the
fact that the installed capacity will be more than doubled, ENEE should not
be expected to contribute more.
7.17      Contributions by the Government would be made in the form of parti-
cipations in ENEE's capital. The amount involved is expected to be L1,725,000
of which L225,000 will be for a microwave communications system and LI.5 million
for the Rio Lindo Project. If ENEE's cash generation does not reach the pro-
jected level, the Government may have to increase its contributions. Congress
will have to approve these appropriations under its normal procedures.
7.18      Borrowings would contribute L34.0 million or 65.0% of the financing.
They would consist of:



- 15 -
(a) $11.5 million, the proposed Bank/IDA financing which would
be passed on to ENEE as a Government loan for a term of 25
years, including a grace period of 3½ years, interest of
&6% and a commitment charge of 3/h%. In financing the foreign
exchange costs of the Rio Lindo Project the Bank/IDA financing
would contribute 65% towards the total cost of the Project.
(b) $1.0 million under Loan No. DI-5/67 from the Central American
Bank for Economic Integration, granted in 1967 for a term of
10 years, including a grace period of 1 year and interest at
6%. This loan will finance 4 diesel units with a total capac-
ity of 10 14w.
(c) Ten-year bonds, totaling L5.5 million ($2.75 million), to be
guaranteed and placed locally by the Banco Central de Honduras,
with an assumed interest rate of 7% and a guarantee commission
of 1% per year. The bonds would have income tax and inheritance
tax exemptions and would be issued as and when needed. It has
been assumed that there will be issues of respectively L1.5
million, L2.0 million and L2.0 million in 1968, 1969 and 1970.
(d) $1.7 million of suppliers' credits to provide financing for
items not included in the Project. It has been assumed that
these credits would be at an interest rate of 7% and for terms
of five years.
7.19      In discussions with the Banco Central de Honduras that institutic.-
expressed the view that it would be able to place the proposed bonds without
any difficulty. There are also indications that suppliers' credits will be
available on satisfactory terms. ENEE has confirmed that it will review with
the Bank and IDA the outcome of its efforts to obtain suppliers' credits.
Future Earnings
7.20      Forecast income statements for the four years 1968 through 1971
are included in Annex 7, and a summary of pertinent financial ratios is
given in Annex 10.
7.21      Revenues are expected to increase from L10.6 million in 1967 to
L17.4 million in 1971. The projections have been based on the expected
sales increases (paragraph 6.05) and on maintenance of the tariffs at their
present level except for a reduction of about 10% in 1971 after completion
of the Rio Lindo Project.
7.22      Operation costs are expected to increase from L5.3 million in 1967
to L10.5 million in 1970, and recede to L9.2 million in 1971. The projections
are based on separate analysis of the major cost items. A considerable in-
crease is expected in the cost of fuel during 1968 through 1970 because of
the greater use which is to be made of diesel power until the Rio Lindo plant
comes into operation in 1971.



- 16 -
7.23      As a result of the additional debt which will finance the Rio Lindo
Project interest will go up considerably and estimated interest coverage will
decline from 3.4 times in 1967 to 2.0 times in 1970. Interest coverage will
improve to a more satisfactory level of 2.5 times in 1971. Over the 1967
through 1971 period return on average net plant in operation would be about
11.7% per annum.
Future Financial Position
7.24      As will be seen from the balance sheet projections for the 1967
through 1971 period given in Annex 6, ENEE's financial position is expected to
remain sound. During those years ENEE's installations are expected to almost
double in book value. The ratio of long-term debt to equity, which under the
previous loan agreements should not exceed 2 to 1, will remain at 1.6 or under
throughout the period.  In view of this the ratio will not guard ENEE in future
against incurring too much debt on a medium-term basis. The proposed ten-year
bonds and five-year suppliers' credits on which amortization starts in the
first year, will already contribute towards a reduction in the debt service
ratio. It is estimated that coverage of debt service by cash earnings will
decline from 2.7 times in 1967 to 1.4 times in 1970. This low point can only
be accepted because of the expected improvement of the ratio to a satisfactory
level of 1.8 times in 1971.  ENEE has agreed not to incur new debt without the
approval of the Bank and IDA, unless the maximum debt service in any succeeding
year would be covered at least 1.5 times by cash earnings made during a twelve-
month period preceding the date on which the new debt was to be drawn down.
This debt service test supersedes the long-term debt to equity ratio test.
7.25      ENEE's policy to reinvest all its earnings was stated in a supple-
mental letter relating to Loan 261-HO. Since ENEE's equity will have to be
built up further in view of the continuing rapid growth of its system, this
statement will be repeated in connection with the proposed financing.
7.26      During the construction period of the Project ENEE is expected to be
able to maintain its working capital at a satisfactory level.
8.  CONCLUSIONS AND RECOMMENDATIONS
8.01      The proposed Project is the most economic of alternative means of
meeting the growing power demand on ENEE's main system (paragraphs 6.01-6.11).
8.02      The Project is technically sound, the estimates of cost   and the
construction schedule are realistic and the arrangements for engineering and
supervision of construction are satisfactory (paragraphs 5.04 - 5.10).
8.03      ENEE's management has improved in recent years but further efforts
to strengthen it are needed (paragraph 3.04).
8.o4      ENEE's financial position is sound and promises to remain so in the
future (paragraphs 7.04, 7.05 and 7.24).



- 17 -
8.05      The proposed Bank loan of $7.5 million and the proposed IDA credit
of $4.0 million would enable the Governnent to lend $11.5 million to ENEE.
The.Project would be suitable for such financing to the extent of $11.5
million equivalent, including $0.7 million for interest during construction,
for a term of 25 years including a grace period of three and a half years.
During the negotiations the following assurances were obtained:
(i) ENEE will, at all times, carry out its functions
under the direction of a qualified and experienced
General Manager, mutually satisfactory to ENEE,
the Bank and IDA ( paragraph 3.02);
(ii) ENEE will discuss and agree with the Bank and IDA
on the effect to be given to the recommendations made
