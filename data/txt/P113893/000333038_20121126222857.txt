F. Results Framework Analysis

Program Development Objectives (from Program Document)
The Programmatic Debt and Fiscal Sustainability DPLs (FSDPLs) were a series of two
operations that were implemented in Jamaica between February 2010 and March 2012. The
development objectives of the program supported by the series as stated in the First
Programmatic DPL were to: (1) Enhance fiscal and debt sustainability by supporting reforms to
increase control on public spending and debt, reduce debt service burden, improve debt
management, reduce financial vulnerabilities, increase public spending effectiveness, and fortify
the country’s ability to cope with the adverse consequences o the global economic downturn; (2)
Increase the efficiency of public financial management and budgeting processes, by improving
the efficiency of public expenditures and investment, strengthening control of public finances
and the effectiveness of budgeting practices; and (3) Further strengthen tax administration and
increase tax revenue through enhancing audit and control, improving client services for tax
payers, broadening tax base, simplifying tax payments, and introducing greater uniformity in tax
policy.

The development objectives of the Second Programmatic DPL, slightly modified those of the
first operation, and were to: (1) Enhance fiscal and debt sustainability, (2) Increase the efficiency
of financial management and budget processes; and (3) Reduce distortions and enhance the
efficiency of the tax system.

Revised Program Development Objectives (as approved by original approving authority)
Project Development Objectives were not officially revised, however there were slight
modifications in FSDPL II as indicated in para 15, namely: (i) PDO 1 was revised to indicate the
operation’s focus on enhancing fiscal and debt sustainability and (ii) PDO 3 was revised to
indicate emphasis on reducing distortions in the tax system.

1. Program Context, Development Objectives and Design 1
1.    This Implementation Completion and Results Report (ICR) describe the results of the First
and Second Programmatic Fiscal Sustainability Development Policy Loans (FSDPLs) to
Jamaica. The first single tranche loan of US$200 million was approved by the Bank Board on
February 23, 2010 and disbursed upon loan effectiveness on February 25, 2010. The second
single tranche loan of US$100 million was approved on September 8, 2011 and disbursed upon
loan effectiveness on October 6, 2011. These operations were intended to support the
Government’s efforts aimed at: (i) Enhancing fiscal and debt sustainability; (ii) Increasing the
efficiency of public financial management and budgeting processes; and, (iii) Improving the
effectiveness and efficiency of the tax system.

1.1 Context at Appraisal
2.   The key underlying problem of the Jamaica economy has been low growth, averaging
about 1 percent per annum in the past 30 years. Excluding exceptional growth years in the
run-up to the 1996 crisis, the economy has on average stagnated. Between 2005 and 2008,
growth averaged even less than 1 percent (Table 1) while the LAC region grew at an annual
average of 5.2 percent over the same period.
3.    Jamaica’s poor growth performance was due to various external as well as domestic
factors. The former include oil price shocks, declining export prices, natural disasters, and the
ongoing international financial crisis. In addition, domestic factors such as weak financial
regulation and the resulting financial crisis in the second half of the 1990s, domestic insecurity
associated with high crime, the loss of competitiveness due to real exchange rate appreciation
and rising real wages, and periodic political unrest undermined economic growth. The low total
factor productivity that might be linked to the debt overhang has also been a major driving factor
behind poor economic performance. 2
4.   The large share of public resources devoted to debt service and the wage bill were
additional constraints on Jamaica’s growth. The public debt-to-GDP ratio averaged
135 percent of GDP in the 2000s and bound 38 percent of total government expenditures, or
13 percent of GDP, to debt servicing. In that period, wages and salaries comprised on average
31 percent of total expenditure, or 10 percent of GDP. Combined, these factors diverted
resources from strongly needed investment in education and infrastructure and aggravated other
growth constraints.
5.   The international financial crisis hit Jamaica hard in the last quarter of 2008, and its
impact was long lasting. GDP declined by 1.7 percent in 2008/09 and by 2.6 percent in
2009/10. The crisis affected Jamaica through four main channels: decline in tourism, lower
export demand and remittances from abroad, worsening financial conditions, and decline in
domestic demand and credit growth. Bauxite and Aluminum exports declined by about

  As per the ICR Guidelines (August 2006, last updated on 10/05/2011) and BP 8.60, this ICR was prepared for the
programmatic FSDPL series as a whole and includes an assessment of the contribution of each individual operation
to the program.

60 percent, and remittances dropped by one-third, leading to a 25 percent depreciation of the
exchange rate. EMBI Global Sovereign spreads tripled to nearly 1000 basis points. Moody’s and
Fitch downgraded Jamaica with a negative outlook due to the deteriorating external environment
and weak domestic fundamentals. The consolidated fiscal deficit doubled to 7.4 percent of GDP
in 2008/09, and increased further to 11.0 percent of GDP in 2009/10. The current account deficit
reached 18.7 percent of GDP in 2008/9, but was cut by half in 2009/10, while major fluctuations
were registered in the consumer prices which rose by 20 percent in 2007/08 before falling by
about 38 percent in 2008/09 and rebounding again by 7 percent in 2009/10 due to rising volatility
of food and fuel prices.

6.    The weak fiscal situation constrained the authorities in their response to the crisis. In
December 2008, government introduced a mini stimulus package favoring mostly the tourism
sector through a temporary reduction in the general consumption tax and, as a Christmas bonus,
tax-free small gifts from abroad. To mitigate the impact of the crisis on the poor, the Government
increased benefit levels and expanded the coverage of the conditional cash transfer program
(PATH) from US$30 million at the end of 2008 to US$34 million in FY2009/10.
7.   In January 2009, the Bank approved a Fiscal and Debt Sustainability DPL to help
Jamaica cope with the impact of the crisis. Initially, this DPL was conceived as a
programmatic operation consisting of a series of three loans, but due to the high risk and
uncertainty, it was approved as a free standing operation. However, the medium term reform
program prepared for that operation was the basis for the series of Programmatic Debt and Fiscal
Sustainability DPLs that followed one year later.
8.    The heavy debt service burden amplified the impact of the crisis on the economy. In
April 2009, Government announced a freeze of public sector wages, which in December was
extended for two additional years. Nonetheless, in the FY09/10 budget, 45 percent of the
appropriation was dedicated to interest payments on outstanding government debt and another
30 percent was for civil servants pay, leaving just 25 percent for office maintenance, supplies
and service provisions. Debt reduction was therefore a key component of the Government’s
strategy to expand the fiscal space and put the economy on a higher growth path.

9.   Thus, on January 14, 2010, Government launched a Debt Exchange (JDX) with a view
to reducing debt service and improving the maturity profile of its outstanding domestic
public debt. The debt exchange was very successful, achieving a participation rate of 99 percent.
The total value of the offer was J$700.0 billion or 65.0 percent of GDP. After the JDX, the
average maturity of the domestic debt increased from 4.5 years to 8.9 years, and the average
coupon on outstanding Jamaica and U.S. dollar domestic debts declined by 650 basis points (bps)
and 200bps to 12.5 percent and 7 percent, respectively. The JDX is estimated to have generated
annualized interest savings for the government of J$41.0 billion (5 percent of GDP) in
FY2010/11, representing a decline of 34 percent in first year of implementation.
10. While the stabilization measures and the debt exchange dealt with the immediate
problems, the Government designed a structural reform program as part of its medium-
term socio-economic policy framework. The framework set out the broad package of policies,
strategies and programs proposed by the Government for implementation over the period
2009-2012. It recognized that reducing debt and controlling the debt generating process were
necessary conditions for achieving its economic and social objectives, such as improving health,
education and addressing crime and violence. The government outlined a set of policy measures
to lower debt, including rationalization of public enterprises, improving public sector efficiency,
comprehensive tax reform, and improving the business climate as a means for placing the
country on a more sustainable fiscal and growth path.
11. The FSDPL was part of a multilateral package of support from international financial
institutions and donors, including the IMF, the CDB, the EU, and the IADB. The package
was designed to provide market liquidity and reduce risks to participants in the debt exchange,
while supporting the Government as it implemented its medium-term reform program. There was
a significant level of donor coordination and fiscal and debt sustainability was the centerpiece in

                                                3
all donors’ programs. In particular, on February 4, 2010, the IMF approved a 27-month Stand-By
Arrangement (SBA) in the amount of US$1.25 billion to manage short term difficulties and
support the longer term reform agenda. Altogether, the financial support from the IFI’s for the
Government’s reform program amounted to nearly 20 percent of GDP. The FSDPL was thus part
of a significant effort by multilaterals to support the debt exchange and to help the GoJ pursue its
long-term development agenda.

1.2 Original Program Development Objectives (PDO) and Key Indicators (as approved)
12.    The Original Program Development Objectives were to:
       • Enhance fiscal and debt sustainability, by supporting reforms to increase control on
       public spending and debt generation, reduce the debt service burden and improve debt
       management, reduce financial vulnerabilities, increase public spending effectiveness, and
       fortify the country’s ability to cope with the adverse consequences of the on-going global
       economic downturn.

       • Increase the efficiency of public financial management and budgeting processes, by
       supporting efforts to improve the efficiency of public expenditures and investment, and
       strengthen control of public finances and the effectiveness of government budgeting
       practices.

       • Further strengthen Tax Administration and increase tax revenue generation capacity,
       through measures aimed at enhancing audit and control, improving client services for tax
       payers, broadening the tax base, simplifying tax payments, and introducing greater
       uniformity in tax policy.

13.   The Key Interim Outcome Indicators included (for March 2011): 3
      (i) Increase in the primary budget surplus of the Central Government by 1.8 percentage
      points of GDP by FY2010/11 (Baseline: 4.8 percent of GDP at end-FY2008/09);
      (ii) Fiscal savings of at least 1.5 percent of GDP generated due to Government’s Debt
      Management Activities (Baseline: Interest paid by Central Government was 16.0 percent
      of GDP in FY2009/10);
      (iii) No more deferred financing (Baseline: Average annual deferred financing from
      FY2000/01 to FY2005/06 was J$497 million);
      (iv) The 2010/11 budget circular has explicitly established the Government’s intention to
      produce consolidated public sector tables in the 2010/11 Budget memorandum (Baseline:
      No such instructions provided in earlier years);
      (v) The 2010/11 budget circular has set explicit targets for the coverage of public entities
      in the FY2010/11 annual Estimates of Revenue and Expenditure (Baseline: No such
      targets provided in earlier years);
      (vi) Reduced losses of Public Bodies generate savings of at least 1 percentage point of
      GDP by FY2010/11 (Baseline: Public entities balance was -2.8 percent of GDP in
      FY2009/10);
      (vii) Information is available on the number and posts of public sector employees in the
      five strategic sectors (Education, Health, National Security, Finance and Agriculture),
      which represent almost 40 percent of total public sector workforce, laying the groundwork
      for the public sector workforce restructuring being undertaken by the Public Sector
      Transformation Unit (PSTU) (Baseline: No employment surveys processed as of FY
      2008/09);
      (viii) The Centralized Human Resource Management (HRM) database is fully functional
      and has updated and accurate information on public employment in the five strategic
      sectors, including age and qualifications of individual employees (Baseline: No data
      published as of FY 2008/09).
      (ix) The timeliness of annual appropriation accounts submission of selected Ministries,
      Departments, and Agencies to Auditor General has improved, as indicated by a decrease in
      accounts outstanding by 20 percent (Baseline: 158 accounts outstanding in December
      2008).
      (x) Increased number of corporate (CIT and GCT) and (non-PAYE) individual tax payers
      on the tax roll reflected in 15 percent increase of the number of tax payers for 2008/09
      compared to 2007/08 (Baseline: 58,655 of taxpayers in 2008/09).

1.3 Revised PDO and Key Indicators

15.    The PDOs were slightly modified in the Second Programmatic FSDPL, as follows:
      1. PDO 1: its last part - “fortify the country’s ability to cope with the adverse consequences
         of the on-going global economic downturn? was dropped in FSDPL II. The revised PDO
         became “Enhance fiscal and debt sustainability, by supporting reforms to increase
         control on public spending and debt generation, reduce the debt service burden and
         improve debt management, reduce financial vulnerabilities, and increase public spending
         effectiveness.?
      2. PDO 3: was modified from “Further strengthen Tax Administration and increase tax
         revenue generation capacity, through measures aimed at enhancing audit and control,
         improving client services for tax payers, broadening tax base, simplifying tax payments,
         and introducing greater uniformity in tax policy? in FSDPL I to “Reducing distortions
         and enhancing the efficiency of the tax system, through reducing the use of fiscal
         incentives and increasing the uniformity of the tax code, improving client services for tax
         payers, broadening the tax base, and simplifying tax payments? in FSDPL II.



                                                  6
16.    The Outcome Indicators for the series were modified as follows:

       (vii) “New investment management system is in use in 10 Ministries? in FSDPL I became
       “The Government has fully implemented the new methodology for evaluating capital
       investments in six pilot ministries? in FSDPL II; and
       (viii) “All MDAs have implemented their MTEFs for the FY2011/12 budget cycle? in
       FSDPL I, became “The six pilot Ministries, Departments, and Agencies (MDAs) have
       submitted their Medium-Term Expenditure Framework (MTEF)? in FSDPL II.

1.4 Original Policy Areas Supported by the Program:

17. The policy areas supported by the Programmatic Fiscal Sustainability DPL series
were similar to their predecessor – The Fiscal and Debt Sustainability DPL. As mentioned
above, the Fiscal and Debt Sustainability DPL was originally conceived and designed as a
programmatic operation. Its Policy Matrix and Results Framework included three phases of short
term as well as medium term reforms, and it would have been the first in a series of three DPLs.
Eventually, that DPL was approved as a self standing operation, but its Policy Matrix was the
basis for the Programmatic FSDPL which followed suit.

18. The FSDPL series supported key elements of the government’s reform program, namely:
(i) enhancing fiscal and debt sustainability; (ii) increasing the efficiency of public financial
management and budgeting processes; and (iii) further strengthening Tax Administration and
increasing tax revenue generation capacity. In particular the DPLs supported key reforms in
seven policy areas: (i) Fiscal Responsibility Framework; (ii) Debt Management;
(iii) Rationalization of Public Bodies; (iv) Public Service Compensation and Incentives;
(v) Fiscal Discipline and Strategic Allocation of Resources; (vi) Public Financial Management;
and (vii) Tax Efficiency and Administration (Table 3). Key reforms envisaged included:
      (i) Promoting fiscal and debt sustainability by consolidating overall public sector
      balances, rationalizing public bodies, and containing the wage bill. Controlling the debt
      generating process in Jamaica requires enhanced debt management and accountability of
      Central Government and Public Bodies’ as laid out in the proposed Fiscal Responsibility
      Framework, rationalization and restructuring of public entities, and improved efficiency of
      management of public sector salaries.

      (ii) Improving transparency and efficiency of public financial management and budget
      processes. While the legal and regulatory framework for effective budgeting and transparent
      financial management exists, a more forward-looking process for prioritization of
      expenditures was needed to ensure effective allocation of resources. This requires timely
      preparation of financial statements, continued efforts in the transition to accrual accounting
      framework, further improvements in auditing and operational capacity to improve the
      efficiency of budget allocation.
      (iii) Reducing distortions and enhancing the efficiency of the tax system. Jamaica’s
      complex tax system is characterized by variable tax rates and many exemptions which distort
      economic incentives and reduce tax revenue in an already tight fiscal environment. To reduce
      distortions, raise fiscal revenues, and improve equity, the Government intended to take

                                                  7
   measures to broaden the tax base, reduce the number of special tax regimes and exemptions,
   simplify tax payment processes, and increase tax compliance. The Government was also
   taking actions to directly reduce the tax burden on low earners by raising income tax
   thresholds, particularly for the elderly.
1.5 Revised Policy Areas
The policy areas supported by the Fiscal Sustainability DPLs remained unchanged throughout
the program.

1.6 Other significant changes
There were no other significant changes throughout the program.

2. Key Factors Affecting Implementation and Outcomes
2.1 Program Performance
19. The global economic environment deteriorated significantly during the
implementation of the FSDPL series, affecting the Jamaican economy adversely. The
FSDPL series coincided with the global financial crisis that adversely affected Jamaica in
multiple ways. Real GDP contracted by a cumulative 5 percent between FY08/09 and FY10/11 –
more than expected during the design of the operation. This affected fiscal performance as
evident from the evolution of key indicators included in the program. The primary fiscal balance
worsened from 6.1 percent in FY09/10 to about 3.3 percent in FY11/12. Fiscal targets were also
affected by another unanticipated development – the Supreme Court decision to award wage
increases to public sector employees in accordance with a previous MOU, despite the
Government’s decision to freeze wages in order to curtail spending. This kept the wage bill
above 10 percent of GDP over the program period. Other macro aggregates also worsened
beyond expectations - the current account deficit deteriorated to 11.2 percent of GDP by
FY11/12 due to declining exports, keeping financing needs high. Public debt as a ratio of GDP
remained elevated and increased slightly from 138 to 139 percent over the same period.
20. The program performed fairly well under FSDPL I, when progress was made in
several important areas of public sector reform, but implementation slowed down
thereafter. The international financial crisis continued, the court forced government to make
substantial retroactive wage payments to civil service employees, privatization of state owned
enterprises lagged and the electoral process prior to the December 2011 elections slowed down
implementation of the program in the second half of that year.
21. Significant progress was made in several areas. In particular, progress was made in
designing and implementing the Fiscal Responsibility Framework (FRF); in stopping deferred
financing of Public Bodies; in creating a suitable institutional setup for managing debt; in
designing and approving a medium term debt management strategy and an annual borrowing
plan and in divesting a number of important state owned enterprises such as the Jamaica Pegasus
Hotel, Air Jamaica, the sugar estates and Mavis Bank Coffee Factory. Progress was also made in
strengthening the office of the Auditor General and in establishing a single tax collection agency
– the Tax Administration of Jamaica (TAJ). In addition, administrative improvements to
facilitate tax compliance were introduced, and the government completed employment surveys in

                                                8
         the public sector to establish a comprehensive database of all public sector employees, a first step
         in an HR management process for the public sector.
         22. On the other hand, little progress was achieved in some areas. In particular, the draft of
         the Debt Law, on which technical assistance was provided by the IFIs, was submitted to
         Parliament but not discussed. Moreover, with the assumption of the new Parliament in early
         2012, the law is yet to be discussed by the House. The wage bill did not decline, and the winding
         up of inactive public entities was not completed. The implementation of the staff rationalization
         plan was put on hold, and there was no progress on expanding the tax base by reducing tax
         waivers and exemptions. Despite some progress on prioritizing public investments and initial
         steps on preparing medium term expenditure frameworks (MTEFs) the budget process did not
         improve significantly. The preparation of consolidated fiscal accounts continues to be a
         challenge and monitoring the finances of on-budget public entities continues to be a problem.

         23. Table 3 presents a summary of the measures supported by the Fiscal and Debt
         Sustainability DPL and by the Programmatic FSDPLs. While this ICR covers only the
         Programmatic FSDPLs, the Table includes also the reforms under the first operation for
         completeness, because that DPL set the basis for the Programmatic FSDPLs. As all those
         measures were Prior Actions for each operation, they were deemed met prior to their
         presentation to the Board of Executive Directors (the complete matrix is in Annex 2).

                                                                                           tax instruments.

      2.2 Major Factors Affecting Implementation:
      24. A major factor affecting implementation of the FSDPL program was the international
      financial crisis, which severely hit the economy. GDP declined for three consecutive years
      (2008-10) as exports, remittances and tourism were adversely affected by external developments,
      and unemployment rose to 14.3 percent by April 2012. The external current account deteriorated,
      leading to depreciation of the domestic currency and higher inflation and interest rates. The
      government focused on efforts to mitigate the impact of the crisis, relaxing fiscal policy and
      delaying structural reforms. In February 2011, the IMF completed the third review of the SBA,
      but then the program went off-track and subsequent reviews were postponed. The May 2012
      Article IV Staff Report concluded that the objectives of the Fund program were not achieved.
      That was confirmed by the Minister of Finance and Planning in his presentation of the 2012/13
      Budget to Parliament on May 24, 2012 (page 17). Economic growth is projected to remain weak,
      with the Bank of Jamaica and PIOJ forecasting growth to be in the range of 0 – 0.5 percent for
      the rest of FY12/13. Nevertheless, authorities have expressed determination that the primary
      balance will be increased to 6 percent of GDP in line with FRF targets due to expenditure
      contraction, a significant revenue package.


                                                               13
25. Achieving the wage bill target was negatively affected by a Supreme Court ruling in
August 2010, which ruled that the government had to pay retroactive wage increases to
public employees. In 2008, government had signed a Memorandum of Understanding (MOU)
with the unions which provided for wage increases of 15 percent in 2008 and 7 percent in 2009.
However, due to the deteriorating fiscal situation following the international crisis, government
announced a three year public wage freeze. The Supreme Court, however, ruled that the MOU
was a binding contract. Thus, in July 2011, government reached agreement with the unions
whereby the public sector payroll was increased by 7 percent in September 2011, and back
payments totaling J$ 22.4 million would be made in equal installments over the following three
years. The additional wage expenditure was financed by a supplementary budget presented to
Parliament in September 2011.
26. Implementation of the government’s reform program slowed down in the months
leading to the Parliamentary elections in December 2011. Political leaders shifted their
attention to the campaign, and higher uncertainty throughout the public sector during the
electoral period resulted in a slower pace of activity at all levels. Eventually, the opposition won
by a landslide, and a new government took office in January 2012. Several pieces of legislation
that were pending at the time of the elections had to be reconsidered by cabinet and re-submitted
to Parliament, creating a large backlog which including some key pieces of legislation envisaged
under the FSDPL program, such as the public debt law.

2.3 Monitoring and Evaluation (M&E) Design, Implementation and Utilization:

Design
27. The Bank and the Ministry of Finance and Planning (MoF) 4 agreed that the MoF will
play the primary role in coordinating monitoring and evaluation of program
implementation. The Government and the Bank agreed to take advantage of several local data
sources to assess progress of the DPL, including the Statistical Institute of Jamaica, Central Bank
of Jamaica reports and analysis, PIOJ and the Auditor General.

Implementation and Utilization
28. Information from those sources, however, was not always available in a timely
fashion. That was compensated by Bank, CDB, IADB and IMF supervision missions and
reports, which helped monitor and evaluate implementation of the program. In February 2010,
Jamaica entered into a Stand-by Arrangement (SBA) with the IMF, which carried out quarterly
reviews of its program. Two reviews of the program were completed in 2010, and a third in
February 2011, but the IMF program went off-track shortly thereafter, and no further reviews
were completed. The IADB had a policy based operation with Jamaica too, but its program also
went off-track at about the same time.
29.     In 2010 and 2011, there were close contacts between the technical teams of the IMF,



4
    The MoF was previously known as the Ministry of Finance and Public Service.


                                                        14
the IADB and the Bank, to follow developments in Jamaica. During those discussions, all
parties agreed that their programs were complementary and compliance or non compliance with
one had a direct impact on meeting the targets of the other programs. The Bank presented
FSDPL II to its Board at a time when IMF Program reviews were delayed and the IADB had not
disbursed its PBL. This decision was made after taking into account a number of factors: (i) the
IMF and the authorities were in close and frequent dialogue and it appeared at the time that the
outstanding reviews would take place, albeit with some delay; (ii) the IADB had signed an MoU
with the authorities in order to bring its program back on track; and (iii) the authorities had met
the outstanding prior action on the FSDPL II, namely the tabling of the Debt Law in Parliament.
There has continued to be good cooperation between technical teams of all three institutions with
regards to sharing of information and data.

2.4 Expected Next Phase/Follow-up Operation:
30. While no follow-up operation is expected at this time, much will depend on how talks
progress between the IMF and Jamaica with respect to a new program. The authorities have
expressed a desire to have a Fund-supported program in place by the end of 2012 and discussions
with the Fund have commenced.

3. Assessment of Outcomes
3.1 Relevance of Objectives, Design and Implementation
31. The objectives of the Programmatic Fiscal Sustainability DPL were highly relevant
when the operations were appraised and they remain relevant to date. The very high level of
public sector debt and the huge burden of servicing that debt were and still are a major
impediment for economic growth and poverty reduction: they crowd out social spending as well
as lending to the private sector. While the JDX provided a respite in the burden of servicing the
debt, and while interest rates remained at relatively low levels, the debt to GDP ratio is now back
to where it was prior to the exchange. Fiscal and debt sustainability are still major challenges for
Jamaica’s economic and social policy, as spelled out in the May 2012 budget speech.

32. The key components of the program, which were largely set by the previous Fiscal
and Debt Sustainability DPL, were fully consistent with the government’s fiscal and debt
sustainability reform program, and with the pillars of the Country Partnership Strategy
(CPS). The FY2010-13 CPS (Report No. 52849) was discussed by the Board of Executive
Directors on February 23, 2010. The FSDPL program was based on three critical and interrelated
development challenges under the Economic Stability Pillar of the CPS: (i) promoting fiscal and
debt sustainability; (ii) improving transparency and efficiency of public financial management
and budget processes; and (iii) reducing distortions and enhancing the efficiency of the tax
system. Thus, the FSDPL was designed to advance the Bank’s strategy in Jamaica. The
programmatic structure of the FSDPL was appropriate, as it provided flexibility both to the
country and to the Bank in a fairly uncertain environment.

3.2 Achievement of Program Development Objectives
33. Under the FSDPL program, tax administration was strengthened, parts of the public
financial management and budgeting processes were modernized and a Fiscal
Responsibility Framework (FRF) was put in place. On the other hand, while substantive
                                                15
institutional reforms took place on debt management, fiscal and debt sustainability were
not enhanced. Consolidating the tax agencies into the Tax Administration of Jamaica (TAJ) and
improvements in tax payment arrangements are important achievements. Implementing the
Fiscal Responsibility Framework (FRF) should also have a lasting impact going forward.
However, for various external and domestic reasons, primary surplus targets were not achieved,
and debt to GDP is back at the 139.2 percent level, which is not sustainable in the long term.
Progress was not made on achieving a more uniform tax system by reducing exemptions and
waivers. The following paragraphs and Table 4 describes in detail the status of the outcome
indicators at the end of the program.
34. A major achievement of the FSDPL program is the establishment of the Fiscal
Responsibility Framework (FRF). The FRF seeks to establish an institutional framework such
that the Government is accountable for applying principles of prudent fiscal management to
achieve medium-term fiscal targets, became effective and formally operational in 2010. In
September 2011, Parliament approved further amendments to strengthen the existing legislation
governing the FRF. The associated regulations of the FRF, were approved by Parliament in April
2012 and further strengthen the FRF by, among other things, establishing sanctions for budget
overruns and failure to meet key fiscal targets (though the new framework does not cover public
bodies, and is yet to be tested).
35. Debt Management is being modernized. The legal basis for the restructuring of the Debt
Management Unit (DMU) was set by an Amendment to the Civil Service Establishment Act
approved on October 18, 2011. The restructuring has been implemented along functional lines as
recommended by the Bank, i.e. a structure having a front, middle and back office. However,
although the new organizational structure is already in place, staffing has not yet been
completed. A Bank team is providing technical assistance to the DMU on the design of a debt
management strategy using the MTDS tool designed by the WB and IMF.
36. The new Debt Management Bill has not been approved yet. The new bill was designed
following the examples of countries with sound practice in this area. Although the Bill had
already been tabled before Parliament in the second half of 2011, due to the elections the Bill
will have to be tabled again for discussion before the new Parliament. While this is a top priority
for the MoF, and authorities expect the bill to be passed by end-2012, the process has taken
longer than envisaged.
37. Meanwhile, the authorities continue to make progress in improving the quality of the
Medium Term Debt Strategy (MTDS). Beginning with the FY2011/12 MTDS, the published
debt strategy includes an explicit borrowing plan.
38. Rationalization of Public Bodies is work in progress. The winding-up of inactive Public
Entities has not been completed. The government plans to put them into one holding company,
which would process their winding-up. While there is a greater degree of oversight over the self-
financing public entities, the monitoring of on-budget public entities needs to be strengthened.

39. The Development Bank of Jamaica (DBJ) has revised its privatization policy, which
requires Cabinet approval. Five sugar companies were divested by August 2011, but the Sugar
Company of Jamaica – a holding company, has still some obligations on its books and its
privatization is pending. Several coffee and citrus companies are in various stages of

                                                16
privatization. The Ministry of Finance is negotiating the sale of Clarendon Alumina Partners.
40. Public sector reform has started, but the wage bill has not decreased. A centralized
HRM database exists, and will form the basis of a broader program of human resource
management for the public sector. All Ministries, Departments and Agencies (MDAs) will be
required to update their information on a quarterly basis. The database will be linked to the
payroll system, and the Government is procuring a HR management software that will benefit
from the availability of this database. Although devolution of authority to selected agencies has
not been fully completed as it was pending final sign-off from the Government (e.g., Minister of
Finance and Governor General), Inter-Disciplinary Transformation Teams have been in place in
at least 10 MDAs. The wage bill was 10.7 percent of GDP in both FY2010/11 and in FY2011/12.
The FRF target is that the wage to GDP ratio should decline 9 percent by 2016.

41. While progress has been made on prioritizing capital investments, little progress has
been achieved in introducing Medium Term Expenditure Frameworks (MTEFs) in public
sector agencies. A system of ranking public investments based on national priorities,
environmental impact, etc was used to evaluate public investments in the FY12/13 budget. The
Government hired a local consultant who helped develop an in-house system for prioritizing
public investments, rather than use the US Environmental Protection Agency software that was
initially being considered. Progress on introducing MTEFs was hampered by high staff rotation
at the Public Expenditure Division and the change of top management at the MoF following the
recent general elections As of February 2012, six pilot ministries and agencies had produced
estimates of their current costs as well as projections of their expenditures in the medium term,
and a consultant was working with them to prepare MTEFs. However a more comprehensive
plan is needed for the budget preparation process and the budget team is working on developing
such a plan.
42. Public Financial Management has improved in several areas. New financial regulations
recommend that all public sector institutions get ready to implement the International Public
Sector Accounting Standards issued by the International Federation of Accountants (IFAC) (only
around 30 percent were in compliance in February 2012). An incipient Treasury Single Account
(TSA) has been established at the BOJ, but it needs to be further developed. Meanwhile, the
Government has closed 142 dormant bank accounts of government entities (out of 369), and it
will continue closing those accounts as the TSA is developed. The Government intends to have a
Central Treasury Management System (CTMS) and a TSA within two years.
43. The Auditor General (AG) office has been strengthened. The Auditor General is
implementing its action plan for institutional and professional capacity building. New
Performance Audit Unit, Financial Audit Unit, and Information Technology Units have been
established, and the Auditor General has centralized its external audit function. The AG office is
one of the 12 ministries/agencies slated for devolution. As of 2012, the AG will have full control
of its Human Resources management. When devolution is completed, the AG will have full
operational independence, although it will continue to be financed by the budget.
44. Tax administration has improved, but no progress has been made in tax policy reform
and in improving uniformity of the tax code. Tax incentives and waivers averaged J$190
million per month in 2011, and total discretionary and statutory waivers exceeded revenue
collected in 2011. Information on tax waivers has been published in the website of the Ministry

                                               17
of Finance each month last year. The stated intention of the Government was to move away from
industry specific incentives into a more general system, and to gradually reduce their amount as
part of the comprehensive tax reform. A Green Paper on tax reform was prepared and circulated
for consultations, and the MoF is in the process of preparing a White Paper that will reflect
feedback from the consultations. Tax collection agencies were merged into the Tax
Administration of Jamaica (TAJ), but the TAJ is yet to become a semi-autonomous authority as
envisaged under the FSDPL program. This is once again due to the need to re-submit related
legislation to the new government.
45. Table 4 presents the status of the Outcome Indicators established by FSDPL I for
March 2011 (the closing date of that operation) and for March 2012 (the end of the
programmatic series).

3.3 Justification of Overall Outcome Rating
Rating: Moderately Satisfactory
46. The outcome of the overall program is rated Moderately Satisfactory. The real gains
from the FSDPL series came from achieving results on a difficult agenda of institutional reforms
related to public financial management and budgeting practices which, once completed, will put
Jamaica in a better position to make progress on fiscal consolidation, expenditure rationalization,
and tax efficiency (PDO No. 2). At a superficial level, if judged strictly by high level quantitative
outcomes, the FSDPL series fell short of achieving fiscal and debt sustainability (PDO No. 1).
The debt to GDP ratio remains at pre-program levels despite the JDX, and the FY2011/12
primary balance was 3.3 percent, well below levels that Jamaica has achieved in the past. A large
part of this outcome can be attributed to an unfavorable external environment due to which
growth projections did not materialize, making fiscal consolidation a difficult exercise. The court
order to pay retroactive wages also worked against the Government’s favor. Partial results were
achieved on revised PDO No. 3 on tax policy and administration. Policy reforms did not take
place in reducing distortions related to tax policy. FSDPL indicators on tax administration were
met and the reconstituted TAJ exceeded revenue targets for the first time this fiscal year. The
government has prepared a green paper on tax reforms but is yet to finalize the way forward in
terms of rationalization of tax waivers.
47. The FSDPL was effective in moving forward a large agenda on capacity building and
institutional reforms in an environment that made prioritization of reforms difficult.
Several aspects of public financial management and budgeting processes were improved (PDO
No. 2), and important structural and institutional reforms were implemented (see 3.4(b) below).
The FRF, measures to put in place an MTEF, debt management reforms, the movement on the
privatization agenda, reforms on tax administration and the beginnings of an information base on
public sector employees were all reforms that will help improve financial and debt management
and put Jamaica on a sustainable fiscal path, even though their impact on outcomes is not seen as
yet. Jamaica has tough choices to make on the way ahead on civil service and pension reform,
tax reform and public sector modernization. Progress under FSDPL series creates a good
foundation and positions the government well in terms of providing information and starting on
the long road of institutional reforms. Given this progress, and the partial progress on achieving
PDO No. 3, the overall program rating was assessed as Moderately Satisfactory.
48. FSDPL I built on the basis set by its predecessor – the Fiscal and Debt Sustainability
DPL, and provided timely financial support as part of the multilateral and bilateral
package that accompanied the successful JDX. This DPL set the stage for the programmatic
operations, defining targets for outcome indicators for both the first and second programmatic
operations. Most of the targets of this operation were met, particularly in the area of public
financial management, and completion of employment surveys for the entire public sector was a
necessary condition for reform of that sector.
49. FSDPL II processing was delayed by weaker implementation of the Program. The
Bank delayed the processing of this operation for about six months, pending government action
in several areas, particularly the proposed Debt Management Law. Some triggers included in the
First Programmatic DPL for the second Programmatic DPL (defined in the first operation as
“Actions Expected to be Supported by the Bank in the Second Programmatic DPL?), were

                                                 24
modified to reflect reality on the ground. For example, the trigger “the FRF is fully operational?
became “the borrower has started to implement the FRF?. The trigger “enactment of the new
Public Debt Law? became “submission to Parliament of the law.? The trigger “the government
has fully implemented the new methodology for evaluating capital investment in all ministries?
became “the Borrower has implemented a new methodology for evaluating capital investment in
six line Ministries?. These changes to the Program reflected the difficulties in pursuing policy
reform and were explained in the Program Document for FSDPL II (Table 3).
50. In July 2011, after government submitted the new Debt Management Bill to
Parliament, the Bank decided to go ahead with this operation, and the Board of Executive
Directors approved it on September 8, 2011. As mentioned above, however, the Bill was not
discussed by Parliament in 2011, and is yet to be discussed even though the new Government has
been in office for almost 8 months. Eventually, 4 end-outcome indicators met their targets, 4
were partially met, and 1 was not met (Table 4).


3.4 Overarching Themes, Other Outcomes and Impacts
(a) Poverty Impacts, Gender Aspects, and Social Development
51. A recent Bank Report concluded that relatively few households are likely to
experience negative shocks to their income or consumption as a result of the FSDPL reform
program. The Report “Jamaica – Poverty and Social Impacts of Fiscal Reforms,? May 22, 2012,
offers both quantitative and qualitative assessments of tax reforms and the privatization of sugar
estates under the Programmatic Fiscal Sustainability DPL series. The impact of the tax reform on
poor households is limited due to excise taxes affecting items that are by and large demanded in
larger proportion by better-off households, while privatization is likely to directly affect just
0.2 percent of the population. This impact is mitigated since those households are more likely to
be beneficiaries of the conditional cash transfer program PATH, and payments were made to
laid-off sugar workers. However, the Report revealed a series of worrisome issues affecting
communities in the neighborhoods of privatized sugar factories which require government
attention. Further, workers in the sectors where privatization is taking place are at a higher risk
from job losses than the average Jamaican worker, and formal job training can make a significant
difference in improving the likelihood of finding employment.
52. The restructuring and strengthening of institutions in the country under the FSDPL
(see below), would contribute to Jamaica’s social development. Those reforms enhance
transparency and would improve efficiency in the use of resources. Finally, there were no
specific gender aspects to this operation.

(b) Institutional Change/Strengthening
53. The Programmatic FSDPLs, following up on the Fiscal and Debt Sustainability DPL
and together with other operations supported by multilateral and bilateral donors,
contributed significantly to the strengthening of institutions in Jamaica. In particular, the
focus on the Fiscal Responsibility Framework and improving fiscal management in general and
the transparency of Public Bodies’ accounts in particular, is essential for improved fiscal
performance and accountability. In addition, the DPL supported a major overhaul of the debt
management office and the adoption of a modern methodology for designing a debt management

                                                25
strategy and managing debt. Also, the FSDPL supported restructuring and capacity building in
the General Auditor’s office, and the merging of tax collection agencies into the Tax
Administration of Jamaica. All those reforms modernize Jamaican institutions, thereby helping
in the economic and social development of the country.

3.5 Summary of Findings of Beneficiary Survey and/or Stakeholder Workshops
N/A
4. Assessment of Risk to Development Outcome
Rating: Substantial
54. The risk that development outcomes will not be maintained is rated substantial
because of the following reasons: (i) the weaker performance of the FSDPL II program, as
well as of programs with the IMF and the IADB, in 2011; (ii) assumption of a new
government in early 2012, which was not involved in the design of the program; (iii)
continuation of the international financial crisis, which limits growth, and (iv) the
permanent threat of natural disasters. Those risks were clearly identified and discussed in the
Program Documents of the DPLs when they were approved, namely: economic, political,
institutional capacity, and natural disasters. The economic risks are due to the global financial
crisis and the resulting economic downturn, which indeed reduced demand for Jamaica’s key
exports of goods and services, and slowed remittances from the US and Europe. Those risks
were partly mitigated by the successful debt exchange in early 2010 and by the subsequent large
drop in domestic interest rates, which saved the government about 5 percentage points of GDP in
interest payments. However, fiscal deficits in the past two years were substantially larger than
projected, and with a debt of nearly 140 percent of GDP and interest payments absorbing over
one half of government revenues, Jamaica is still very vulnerable to external shocks.

55. The new government is still putting together its implementation plan for policy
reforms. On May 24, 2012, the new government stated its commitment to fiscal responsibility
and structural reforms in the 2012/13 Budget Speech to Parliament. In that presentation, the
Minister of Finance and Planning stated the government’s intention to reengage with the IMF
and to break the cycle of slow growth through “the exercise of fiscal responsibility and the
adoption of structural reforms that will enhance the external competitiveness of Jamaican
businesses and products in the long term? (page 18). As those things materialize, the risks to
development outcomes of the FSDPLs would decline accordingly. At the same time, the
institutional reforms supported by the FSDPL are helping to modernize Jamaica’s public sector,
and it is unlikely that they would be undone. The Bank and other multilateral and bilateral
agencies are supporting this process by providing technical assistance for institutional capacity
building and advancing public sector reform. Finally, the risk of natural disasters is a permanent
feature in the Caribbean, as the September 2010 floods show. Jamaica mitigates this risk by its
participation in the Caribbean Catastrophe Risk Insurance Facility (CCRIF), which helps to
offset financing costs in the case of a major disaster, and by programs with donors aimed at
addressing natural disasters when they happen.

5. Assessment of Bank and Borrower Performance
5.1 Bank Performance
(a) Bank Performance in Ensuring Quality at Entry
Rating: Moderately Satisfactory

56. The Bank team prepared this operation on a fast-track calendar, given the urgency of the
government financial situation and the significance of the debt exchange. The content of the
Policy Matrix of the Programmatic FSDPL was largely set by the previous Fiscal and Debt
Sustainability DPL, approved in January 2009, which was originally conceived as the first
operation of a programmatic series and included a medium term reform program. However, the
program, as evident from hindsight, was very ambitious and included measures that were
difficult to achieve in a two-year period of time. The sequencing of the reform program could
also have been thought through carefully. For example, achieving reforms on public service
compensation without having information on the size of the public sector and a database of
public sector employees is difficult to do.

57. The team coordinated with other IFIs and multilateral donors, and put together a program
in record time in support of the JDX. 5 As mentioned above, processing of FSDPL II was delayed
by weaker implementation of the program, and the team had to soften several items of the policy
matrix in order to reflect reality on the ground. That, however, is part of the flexibility embodied
in the nature of a programmatic operation.
(b) Quality of Supervision
Rating: Satisfactory

58. Supervision of FSDPL I was undertaken together with preparation of FSDPL II, since the
PDOs remained fairly constant throughout the program. Supervision of FSDPL II was delayed
by elections at end 2011, but the mission that visited Jamaica in February 2012 did a thorough
review of the program and highlighted outstanding issues to the authorities to advance the overall
reform program.
(c) Justification of Rating for Overall Bank Performance
Rating: Moderately Satisfactory
The Overall Bank Performance is rated Moderately Satisfactory for the reasons explained above.
5.2 Borrower Performance
(a) Government Performance


5
  FSDPL I includes a Debt Sustainability Assessment (DSA) that projects a primary surplus of 9.1 percent of GDP
for several years into the future (annex 5). Based on Jamaica’s past performance, the realism of such a projection is
highly questionable. As this operation was prepared under a very tight schedule, these projections were borrowed
from the IMF. However, the Bank team should have looked at the IMF’s fiscal and debt scenario with more critical
eyes.




                                                        27
Rating: Moderately Satisfactory
59. Government performance is rated moderately satisfactory as an average between a fairly
satisfactory implementation of FSDPL I, and a less satisfactory implementation of FSDPL II.
Following the JDX in early 2010, government implemented important institutional and structural
reforms included in the FSDPL program. That performance, as well as compliance with
programs with the IMF and the IADB, weakened markedly the following year. The deteriorating
external environment and its impact on the economy put growing pressure on the authorities.
This was further compounded by a lengthy commission on inquiry into the role of the
government in the May 2010 unrest in Tivoli Gardens which resulted in 75 persons killed, led to
the resignation of the sitting prime minister and possibly a push for early elections. In addition,
the electoral campaign in late 2011 and the transition to a new government in early 2012 brought
reforms virtually to a halt.

(b) Implementing Agency or Agencies Performance
Rating: Moderately Satisfactory

60. The reform program reflected the agenda and priorities of the government at the time, and
the Bank’s operation helped catalyze these reforms with both TA and financial assistance. MoF
made considerable effort to move the agenda forward, which required significant coordination
among units (and with other MDAs in some cases). The ministry's efforts were adversely
affected by the fact that the government could not focus on the reform agenda in the run up to
elections. Despite this, it is difficult to explain why progress was slow in some areas which were
well under the control of the MoF, such as the appointment of staff in the debt office, and the
preparation of the white paper on tax reform.

(c) Justification of Rating for Overall Borrower Performance
Rating: Moderately Satisfactory

61. The Overall Borrower Performance is rated Moderately Satisfactory for the reasons
explained above.
6. Lessons Learned
62. The FSDPL program was implemented at a time when Jamaica was facing a significant
economic crisis and required a rapid response on the part of the Bank and other partners. A
number of lessons were learned from this wide-ranging and ambitious program of reform. These
include the following:

   1. Coordination with other multilaterals and bilateral institutions enhances the impact
      of Bank operations. FSDPL I was part of a package of support for the JDX by IFIs and
      bilateral donors, and its impact was amplified by complementary programs by the IMF
      and the IADB.
   2. Use of high level outcome indicators to measure progress can be problematic. Since
      this was an operation that was meant to enhance debt and fiscal sustainability, it made
      sense, a priori, to include quantitative measures such as the primary balance to GDP and
      debt to GDP. In hindsight, however, it was clear that these outcomes are well beyond the

                                                28
       control of the Bank or the Government. The impact of the global crisis, the Supreme
       Court ruling on wages, and an early election on these indicators was something that was
       difficult to counter with the measures envisaged in the FSDPL series.
   3. The use of technical assistance and/or investment lending to bolster capacity can
      help achieve results on reforms. The significant TA provided under the DFID trust fund
      on debt management went a long way in furthering the agenda on debt management. The
      MTEF component of the TA was added later, and it is hoped that once this component
      becomes fully operational (hopefully in late 2012), good progress will be made on the
      MTEF agenda.
   4. Including privatization of specific enterprises as an outcome indicator is
      problematic. First, concluding privatization of a state owned enterprise does not depend
      on government only. This is clearly a case where “you need two to tango?. Further,
      having such a target in the Program could put government in a weaker position when
      negotiating with potential buyers who may be aware of the government’s constraints.
   5. Using the Programmatic Approach is prudent in crisis situations with tough
      reforms required. The programmatic approach to policy based lending has two main
      advantages: it provides a medium term perspective to a reform program, coupled with
      more flexibility than a conventional multi-tranche loan. It is particularly suitable when
      the agenda includes difficult reforms, which cannot be implemented all at once. In the
      case of the FSDPL, the key elements of the policy matrix were set by its predecessor –
      the Fiscal and Debt Sustainability DPL, which was originally conceived as the first
      operation of this series. It was very useful that that operation included a policy matrix
      which provided context and a medium term horizon for the reform program, setting the
      stage for the programmatic FSDPL.

   6. The Bank and its clients need to be careful in considering sequencing and timing for
      reforms that deal with structural changes and capacity building initiatives. In the
      words of an MoF official, “we (the Jamaican authorities) became victims of our own
      desire to achieve things quickly.? A number of reforms envisaged under the FSDPL
      program can take years as is evidenced by cross country experience. This includes
      reforms such as preparing and implementing MTEFs, Single Treasury Accounts,
      Centralized Treasury Management Systems, procurement reforms etc. As the experience
      with the DMU restructuring showed, recruiting highly skilled professionals using the
      civil service wage structure in an environment where these professionals command a
      significant premium in the private sector is next to impossible.
