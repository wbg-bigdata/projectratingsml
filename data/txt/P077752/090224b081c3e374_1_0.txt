                         Implementation Status Overview
                         PDO: Good progress is being maintained towards achieving the PDO. Environmental conditions in seven out of nine project cities/counties have improved following completion of
                         investments for water supply, waste water collection and treatment, and solid waste disposal. The remaining wastewater works in Qixia city are nearing completion. The last two
                         contracts for Xisha river rehabilitation in Zaozhuang are expected to be completed in August 2013. With the completed works, the rate of wastewater treated in project cities/counties
                         has risen from 65% at appraisal to 91.3%, exceeding the completion target of 80%; the percentage of population provided with solid waste services in Heze and Rizhao has now
                         reached 92.5% against that of 84% at appraisal , nearing to the end of project target of 95%. In Gaomi county, 99% people now access to water supply services, exceeding the end
                         of project target of 97%. The rate of compliance of connected industries with the discharged standards has risen from 60% at appraisal to 98.9% now, exceeding the target of 90%.

                         GEO: Good progress also has been made in the implementation of the Yantai GEF Pilot Septic Tank Management project. The septic tank emptying program is now fully
                         operational. The service areas have expanded from the pilot demonstration area to an adjacent area in Zhibu District. To date, 1,600 septic tanks have been emptied and 10,018.1
                         tons of septage were collected and treated in Xinanhe WWTP. BOD discharged to the Bohai Sea was reduced by an estimated 806.63 tons in 2012. The “Yantai City Urban Area
                         Septic Tank Construction and Management Regulations? were finalized, and a septic tank emptying tariff will be implemented in 2013 to promote sustainability.
