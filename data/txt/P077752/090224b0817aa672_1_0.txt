                         Implementation Status Overview
                         PDO: Good progress is being maintained towards achieving the PDO. Environmental conditions in Seven out of nine project cities/counties have improved following completion of
                         investments for water supply, waste water collection and treatment, and solid waste disposal. The remaining wastewater works in Qixia city are nearing completion. The last two
                         contracts for Xisha river rehabilitation in Zaozhuang should be completed in late 2013. With the completed works, the volume of wastewater treated has risen from 103 million m3/
                         year at appraisal to 332.6 million m3/year, exceeding the completion target of 226 million m3/year; solid waste collected and transfered to sanitary landfills has now reached 568,177
                         ton, exceeding the end of project target of 450,775 tons. The percentage of population connected to wastewater treatment plant has risen from 58% at appraisal to 88% now,
                         exceeding the target of 85%. The percentage of population with solid waste services was 84% at appraisal and now reaches 92%, nearing the final target of 95%. The rate of
                         compliance of connected industries with the discharged standards has risen from 60% at appraisal to 93.1% now, exceeding the target of 90%.

                         GEO: Good progress also has been made in the implementation of Yantai GEF Pilot Septic Tank Management project. The septic tank emptying program is now fully operational
                         and 1,351 septic tanks have been emptied to date. It's estimated that the BOD discharged to THE Bohai Sea was reduced by 685.4 tons in 2012. The “Yantai City Urban Area Septic
                         Tank Construction and Management Regulations? were finalized, and a septic tank emptying tariff will be implemented in 2013 to promote sustainability.
