LIBERIA
FIFTH HIGHWAY PROJECT
CREDIT AND PROJECT SUMMARY
Borrower:         The Republic of Liberia
Amount:           SDR 10.9 million (US$11.4 million equivalent)
Terms:            Standard
Project
Description:      The project seeks to improve Liberia's public road network by
strengthening the Ministry of Public Works' (MPW) capacity to
carry out road maintenance. It provides for: (i) technical
assistance and training to improve MPW's financial and
administrative management and help plan and execute the
maintenance program; (ii) a three-year routine maintenance
program covering the entire public road network of about
4,725 miles; and (iii) periodic maintenance on about 450
miles of priority primary and secondary roads through
rehabilitation or regravelling. Liberia's population would
benefit from reduced transportation and vehicle operating
costs; rural areas that are now difficult to reach due to the
poor state of the road network would have improved access to
markets. The main risks of the project are that planned
improvements in MPW's management performance would not be
fully realized and that the Government would be unable to
provide sufficient funding for maintenance thus reducing
maintenance output. The project would minimize these risks
by providing technical assistance and gradually phasing in
the Government's contribution to incremental recurrent
maintenance costs.

FIFTH HIGHWAY PROJECT
STAFF APPRAISAL REPORT
I. THE TRANSPORT SECTOR
A. Geographic and Economic Factors
1.01     Liberia is a relatively small country with a land area of 43,000
square miles consisting of a narrow coastal plain with extensive swamps, tidal
lagoons and creeks, a central area of plateaux and valleys covered by high
rain forests, and a mountainous area along the Guinea border. Rainfall is
heavy at over 2,500 mm per annum and largely concentrated in a 6-month period
from May till October.  Although these geographical and climatic features do
not constitute a major obstacle to transport development, they make construc-
tion and maintenance of transport infrastructure rather expensive.
1.02     Liberia is well endowed with natural resources, notably iron ore,
timber and rubber. These allowed the country to realize rapid economic growth
in the sixties and early seventies through spectacular increases in value
added and output, and improvements in its terms of trade. However, the energy
crisis and the subsequent recession in the industrialized countries killed the
export-led boom and the rate of GDP growth dropped to less than 1.0 percent
between 1974-79, despite an expansionistic investment policy followed by the
Government; the major decline occurred in iron ore exports, from 25 to 17
million tons. Persistent weak external demand, deterioration of the invest-
ment climate following the change in Government in 1980 and reduced public
investment led to a decrease in real GDP of about 15 percent between 1980 and
1982. The medium term outlook for a resumption of rapid economic growth
appears bleak.
B. The Transport System
1.03     Historically transport infrastructure evolved around the private
concessions, which created feeders from the natural resource locations to the
ports of evacuation. It was only in the second half of the 1960s and particu-
larly in the 1970s that an integrated highway system began to take shape as
part of Government's strategy to create a more diversified agriculturally-
based economy. Still, many potentially productive agricultural areas have
only poor and circuituous connections to the ports and the main market center,
Monrovia. Transport infrastructure presently consists of about 6,200 miles of
roads, three mining-related railway lines totalling about 300 miles, four
seaports, two international airports and numerous airfields. Generally poor
management and inadequate funding for maintenance, have in recent years led to
deterioration of a large part of the infrastructure.



1.04     Major transport flows reflect the pattern of economic activity and
are primarily based on iron ore and timber, followed by rubber and other
agricultural products, and imported goods. Road transport, the predominant
mode but for iron ore, is concentrated around Monrovia and along the Monrovia-
Ganta axis where the principal rubber plantations are located. Public use of
the railways is very limited; only the LAMCO line carries some general cargo
and timber traffic on a contract basis, and operates a daily passenger ser-
vice. Domestic air transport usefully complements the underdeveloped land
transport system by serving business interests 4n remote areas. Despite a
substantial cost advantage over land transport, commercial coastal shipping
between Monrovia and the isolated southeastern part of the country is limited
due to pilferage, damage and customs problems.
1.05     The deepwater ports of Monrovia and Buchanan account for the major
portion of port traffic, including all iron ore shipments; the shallow-water
ports of Greenville and Harper handle mainly log exports. Between 1974 and
1980 total port traffic declined by about 5.5 pe!rcent per annum from 27.3
million tons to 19.4 million tons. As a consequence the National Port Author-
ity (NPA)'s operating results deteriorated and, after the change in Government
in 1980, were undermined further following the hiring of several hundred
unnecessary additional staff. With Government concurrence NPA is presently
taking steps to redress the situation by bringing staffing in line with the
present level of port activity and is implementing other cost saving measures
as well. With minor investments to improve their efficiency, the capacity of
the ports of Greenville and Harper is adequate to handle probable future
traffic. The port of Monrovia requires rehabilitation of the existing margin-
al wharf and the construction of specialized cargo handling facilities to deal
with the growing container traffic.
1.06     Liberia has two international airports, both in the vicinity of
Monrovia, and numerous airfields of which four are served by scheduled flights
of Air Liberia (AL), a Government-owned airline. Between 1971 and 1979,
international passenger traffic increased rapidly at a rate of 11 percent per
annum to about 118,000 passenger movements but dropped significantly in 1980
as a result of the decline in general economic activity. Development of
domestic passenger traffic followed a similar trend. AL suffers continuous
losses, because of too low tariffs and poor management; during the second half
of 1982 the Government purchased a Boeing 727 for executive use and a second
hand Boeing 707 for international passenger flights.  These acquisitions have
increased AL's operating losses. Government is taking steps to enter into a
management contract with a foreign carrier in orier to reverse AL's deteriora-
ting operational and financial situation.
C. Transport Policy, Planning and Coordination
1.07     Liberia's Second Development Plan (1981,/82-1984/85) has the character
of a stabilization program, giving priority to completion of ongoing projects,
and incorporating only essential new projects in priority areas. In the roads
sub-sector this strategy translates into the postponement of most new highway
investments, increased emphasis on highway maintenance, and feeder road devel-
opment in support of the priority sector, agricu:Lture.
1.08     Total planned public expenditure for transport development during the
Second Plan period is set at US$159.3 million of which the roads sector



accounts for 68 percent (US$109.0 million), civil aviation for 1 percent
(US$1.5 million) and ports for 31 percent (US$48.8 million). The investment
program reflects well the priority needs of the sector with the exception of
the proposed expansion of Monrovia Port; it is envisaged to construct a
separate container wharf south of the existing wharfs, to handle 60,000
containers per annum. The proposed facility would be larger than required and
Government should reassess the planned investment paying due regard to the
economic justification and long term effects on NPA's finances.In any event,
the investment targets are unlikely to be realized considering that two years
of the plan period have already passed with very little investment activity.
1.09     The Ministry of Commerce, Industry and Transport (MCIT) has the
overall responsibility for transport management but performs regulatory func-
tions only, leaving the broader questions of transport policy formulation and
coordination unaddressed. The Bank-financed Feeder Roads Project provides for
technical assistance to strengthen the Ministry's Bureau of Transportation in
the latter two areas. The Infrastructure Division of the Ministry of Planning
and Fconomic Affairs (MPEA) is making efforts to fill to the extent possible
the existing vacuum but does not have adequate experienced staff either.
Therefore, at the request of Government, the Loan Agreement for the Feeder
Roads Project was amended in December 1983 to transfer the transport planning
component from MCIT to MPEA. This is expected to provide the basis for the
establishment of a properly trained transport policy and coordination unit.
D. Previous Bank Group Involvement in the Sector
1.10     Historically, Bank Group financial assistance to Liberia's transport
sector totals US$67.3 million, comprising six projects -- four for main roads,
one for feeder roads and one for the port of Monrovia.  The First Highway
Project (Loan 368-LBR, 1964, US$4.25 million) was completed in 1969. The
project consisted of road reconstruction and the supply of equipment for road
maintenance. The Port of Monrovia Project (LoeLn 617-LBR, 1969, US$3.6 millio-
n) completed in 1977, comprised dredging, purchase of tug boats and naviga-
tional equipment, technical assistance and studies. No PCRs were prepared for
these early projects but they created the foundations for further development
of the sector.  The Second Highway Project (Loan 907/Credit 395-LBR,
1973,US$5.6 million) was completed in 1978 and included road construction in
Monrovia, procurement of highway maintenance and workshop equipment, technical
assistance for road maintenance, and studies. The Project Performance Audit
Report concluded that the project was executed satisfactorily but that the
appraisal had been overly optimistic as to the time required to set up an
effective maintenance organization. The Third Highway Project (Loan 1156-LBR,
1975, US$27.5 million) comprised construction of a road and river crossing in
Monrovia, construction of the Totota-Ganta section of the principal trunk road
into the interior, provision of operating funds for a feeder road construction
brigade, technical assistance for road transport planning and studies.  The
project was completed in 1981, more than two years behind schedule, but within
the original cost estimate. The principal cause for the time overrun was the
slow implementation of the main civil works component, the construction of the
83 mile Totota-Ganta road, which took five and a half years to complete. In
retrospect, splitting of this work into two separate contracts might have
enabled completion in time and at lower cost. A Project Completion Report,
basically prepared by the Government, was issued December 30, 1982.



-4-
1.11     There are two on-going projects in the trarnsport sector.  The Fourth
Highway Project (Loan 1573-LBR, 1978, US$13.8 milLlion) comprised rehabilita-
tion of the Paynesville-Totota and Paynesville-Robertsfield roads, technical
assistance for the organization and execution of road maintenance, technical
assistance for road transport planning, and stud-Les. The Paynesville-Totota
road rehabilitation suffered a substantial cost overrun, leaving part of the
road and a bridge uncompleted. A supplemental credit (Credit 1311-LBR, 1982,
SDR 1.7 million) was approved to reconstruct the bridge and update the engi-
neering of the remaining road works, activities which were successfully con-
cluded by the end of 1983. The African Development Bank has agreed in princi-
ple to finance the remaining road works as a separate project in 1984. The
Feeder Roads Project (Loan 1664-LBR, 1979, US$10.,7 million) continues and
expands the feeder road activities started under the Third Highway Project.
It originally consisted of the construction or improvement of some 700 miles
of feeder roads, mostly in support of Bank/IDA - financed agricultural pro-
jects, related consultant services, technical assistance for the development
of the domestic contracting industry and technical assistance for the streng-
thening of the transport co-ordinating role of the MCIT. From the onset the
project suffered from inadequate local funding, poor management and procure-
ment problems and, after the change in Government; in 1980, it came practically
to a standstill. Upon the request of the Government the Bank approved a loan
amendment increasing disbursement percentages and setting up a revolving fund
to ease the financial constraints. Simultaneously, Government took steps to
strengthen project management and, as a result, feeder road construction was
resumed in late 1982 and is now showing increasing progress.
II. THE HIGHWAY SUBSECTOR
A. Road Network
2.01     The public road network totals 4,726 miles as shown in the following
table. Of this some 2,450 miles are all weather roads and the remainder roads
serviceable during the dry season only. In 1981, the paved network consisted
of some 366 miles, making its share in the public road system quite low at
about 8 percent. In addition to the public road network, the iron ore, rubber
and logging concessions have built and maintain close to 1,500 miles of pri-
vate, mostly laterite surfaced roads and an undetermined mileage of tracks in
the forest areas. The public network is inadequate both in extent and quality
given present traffic levels and development needs. Only 366 miles of the
public road system are paved, while about 400 miles out of 2,100 miles of the
all-weather laterite network are estimated to carry more than 300 vehicles per
day and their paving would probably be justified. However, given the shortage
of resources the Government is experiencing, thiE is not feasible.

2.02     During the First Plan period (1976/77-1979/80) the mileage of paved
roads and all weather secondary and feeder roads increased by 50%.   On the
other hand the quality of the primary gravel roads deteriorated due to inade-
quate maintenance; although classified as all-weather roads, passage over a
number of these roads has become difficult during the rainy season. The
mileage and composition of the private road network did not change much over
the past decade.
B. Road Fleet and Traffic
2.03     Vehicle fleet statistics are derived from vehicle registration
records; the composition and development of the fleet is shown in the follow-
ing Table.

Although the figures for the last three years show a drop in the overall fleet
and are to some extent supported by the trend in vehicle import statistics, it
seems likely that the fleet presently in use is somewhat higher. The Table
reflects vehicles for which revenues were collected; enforcement of vehicle
registration has been lax especially since the change of Government in 1980
after which a large number of private vehicles were confiscated.
2.04     The last country-wide traffic counts were conducted in 1971; since
then counts have been limited mostly to specific roads in conjunction with
feasibility studies. With technical assistance under the Fourth Highway
Project a comprehensive national traffic survey is being implemented. Al-
though it is not yet completed, preliminary results indicate that a major drop
in traffic occurred after 1980, presumably as a consequence of the imposed
travel restrictions and the continuing decline in economic activity. This
trend is confirmed by a decline in fuel consumption. The most heavily traf-
ficked road outside the capital is the Monrovia-Paynesville-Totota-Ganta road
which carries about 9,000 vpd on the first section decreasing to some 1,500
vpd north of Paynesville and about 500 vpd near Ganta. Traffic is likely to
gradually return to previous levels with the recent lifting of travel restric-
tions.
C. Road Transport Industry
2.05     The road transport industry consists of a large number of small
private truckers, minibus owners, and small taxi enterprises.   Entry into the
road transport industry is relatively open with Government intervention lim-
ited to vehicle registration, licensing and inspection. Government sets
maximum tariffs for public passenger transport and inter-city trucking ser-
vices but enforcement is limited and actual tariffs do sometimes exceed offi-
cial tariffs in areas where poor road conditions discourage competition.
Otherwise the industry is free of regulations and competition generally en-
sures adequate services to the public. Vehicle occupancy rates in Monrovia
are quite high with an average of 3.5 for taxis and 70 percent of capacity for



- 7 -
buses. These indicate a transport system operating at near capacity. Passen-
ger transport is profitable and the lack of expansion of service is primarily
due to scarcity of investment capital.
2.06     A public bus corporation, the Monrovia Transit Authority (MTA) was
established in 1979 but due to the corporation's under-capitalization, weak
management and poor maintenance capability, its original fleet of 22 buses is
largely broken down. In-city services have all but ceased operations and the
remaining buses are operating for one of the mining companies on a contract
basis. From the point of view of economic efficiency Government divestiture
of MTA would be warranted.
2.07     Control of axle-load legal limits is not enforced despite that five
weighbridges were procured by the Ministry of Public Works in 1976. One
weighbridge was assembled and installed but the access ramps are yet to be
built; it is estimated that enough parts are still available to assemble two
more weighbridges. During negotiations Government agreed to fully install
these weighbridges and make adequate budgetary provisions to cover their
operating and maintenance costs by December 1985.
D. Domestic Construction Industry
2.08     The involvement of domestic contractors in the relatively large
volume of road construction over the past five years has been limited; almost
all major road construction contracts have been awarded to foreign firms as
domestic contractors do not have the capacity to undertake paved road con-
struction. The three most important domestic contractors have periodically
been engaged in the construction of rural secondary roads, private roads for
concessionaires and sub-contracting for foreign contractors. They have fair
engineering competence but are generally under-equipped, lack adequate mana-
gerial expertise and have insufficient working capital. Slow payment by
Government for work performed and lack of job opportunities, due to the de-
cline in new road construction activity since 1980, have aggravated their
cash-flow problems.
2.09     It is Government's stated objective to further the development of the
domestic contracting industry but a sustained effort to develop and implement
a suitable development program to this end has been lacking thus far. The
ongoing Feeder Roads Project includes US$4.0 million for construction of
feeder roads by domestic contractors, as well as funding for technical assist-
ance to the local contracting industry. The first bids for civil works are
expected to be invited in 1984. MPW is expressing renewed interest in the
role of domestic contractors in the country's highway development and main-
tenance efforts and is presently preparing a position paper on the issue for
Government's consideration. As a longer term policy direction MPW proposes to
gradually reduce its force account maintenance activities in favor of the
private contracting industry. Under the proposed project, funds are included
to let some of the regravelling works on the primary road network to domestic
contractors (paras. 3.08 and 4.01). If successful, this approach could pro-
vide continuity of work to contractors thereby eliminating one of the major
bottlenecks to their development.

E. The Ministry of Public Works
2.10     The Ministry of Public Works (MPW) is responsible for the planning,
design, construction and maintenance of the public highway system. The orga-
nization of MPW is shown in Annex 2-1. The four main functions of administra-
tion, engineering, construction and operations (maintenance) are undertaken by
separate bureaus. Although MPW's responsibilities include the feeder road
network, its capacity constraints have led the Government to set up additional
construction capability within other Ministries and governmental agencies.
This proliferation of agencies involved in feeder roads, working by and large
in isolation, has spread available scarce human and physical resources so
thinly that in the end little output is realized, quality standards are gener-
ally low and economic losses are being incurred. The new transport policy
formulation and coordination effort being supported under the ongoing Feeder
Roads Project (para.1.09) will review the situation with a view to improve
efficiency and ensure adequate coordination between the various executing
agencies.
1. Staff and Training
2.11     MPW employs on its Recurrent Budget a permanent staff of 3,200 which
for certain categories is excessive. In addition, varying numbers (presently
less than 100) of semi-permanent staff are hired on the Development Budget for
construction jobs.  MPW professional staff include 45 engineers, 8 architects,
i transport economist and 2 accountants. Management is entirely Liberian and
only a few expatriates on local contracts remain in technical positions.
Senior staff in the highways sector were generally trained abroad and have
good qualifications. However, partly due to the exodus of professional staff
from the Ministry since the change in Government, it is weak in middle level
managers and engineers. Working conditions are difficult under the prevailing
budgetary constraints and staff morale and job performance are poor; all
Government civil servants' pay scales have been reduced by 16-25% as of Janu-
ary 1, 1983. The proposed project will to some extent improve working condi-
tions; however, the adequacy of present financial incentives to attract and
retain sufficiently qualified professional and managerial staff should be
assessed at the national level.
2.12     As part of its manpower development program, over the years MPW has
provided scholarships for study at the Universit;y of Liberia and overseas. In
addition, MPW engineers have been assigned to consulting firms supervising
foreign funded road construction projects to expose them to up-to-date con-
struction and contract management methods.
2.13     MPW operates a Road Maintenance Training Center for sub-professional
staff at Camp Mechlin. The Center was established in 1975 with technical
assistance from the Federal Republic of Germany (FRG), and has trained road
technicians, mechanics and equipment operators at a rate of some 30 per
annum. In view of recently imposed hiring limitations, the emphasis of the
training program has shifted from training of new recruits to upgrading skills
of existing MPW staff. FRG's assistance was discontinued in 1981 but under a
Japanese loan for equipment, provision is made for instructors and training
aids to reinforce the Liberian staff at Camp Mechlin. Training capacity is
adequate for MPW's needs.

2. Highway Planning and Programming Bureau
2.14     Road planning is carried out by MPW's Planning and Programming Bureau
(PPB) in consultation with MPEA.   PPB's functions include collecting and
analyzing data on roads and road transport and carrying out studies to deter-
mine economic priorities and design standards. All major projects, however,
are preceded by feasibility studies carried out by consultants. Technical
assistance for the organization and development of the PPB was provided under
the Third and Fourth Highway Projects and good progress has been made. How-
ever, the prevailing budgetary constraints have led to a slowdown in the
activities of the Bureau.
3. Engineering Division
2.15     MPW's Engineering Division carries out preliminary investigations and
road and bridge designs with assistance from MPW's soils and materials labo-
ratory, but engineering and supervision of major road projects is done by
foreign consultants. Liberia's terrain and climatic conditions pose few pro-
blems for highway designers and builders. However, there is a dearth of
hydrological data, making the estimation of drainage requirements difficult.
Geometric and pavement specifications are generally based on US design stan-
dards adapted to local conditions.
4. Bureau of Construction
2.16     For major road works, MPW employs contractors following suitable
prequalification and tendering procedures; contracts are normally let on a
unit price basis.   In recent years, MPW's Bureau of Construction has under-
taken several force account road construction projects, but with mixed re-
sults, and MPW is, partly as a result, expressing active interest in develop-
ment of local contractors (para. 2.09).
5. Operations (Maintenance) Bureau
2.17     MPW's Operations Bureau is responsible for the maintenance of the
entire public primary and secondary road network, as well as for the annual
reshaping and periodic regravelling of the improved feeder roads network.
Routine maintenance of feeder roads is to be carried out by local communities
largely on a self-help basis and with technica:L supervision provided by MPW.
This approach will be tested on a pilot basis in two counties under the on-
going Feeder Roads Project.
2.18     For maintenance execution the country is divided into three regions
(consisting of 3 counties each) each headed by a regional engineer, and 12
districts headed by district engineers, including one district covering metro-
politan Monrovia. The Operations Bureau employs some 2,200 staff for road
maintenance which is more than sufficient for the present network in numbers
but inadequate with respect to skill requirements. In the lower ranks there
is a large number of older employees who have received little or no formal
education or training, while there is a dire need at the middle and senior
management levels for more qualified engineers, and mechanical and works
superintendents. Although 30 staff occupy the position of engineer only about
12 have the required qualifications. In addition, the Operations Bureau
employs about 25 technicians, 35 superintendents, 160 foremen, over 700



- 10 
mechanics, operators and drivers, 260 administrative support staff, and close
to 1,000, mostly unskilled, laborers. Maintenance operations are largely
mechanized, but labor gangs carry out some of the routine maintenance tasks.
However, labor productivity is low while nominal wages are relatively high at
around US$10 per active working day, making labor intensive maintenance prac-
tices rather unattractive.
2.19     Over the past 10 years the Bank Group has been actively involved in
road maintenance development in the country, primarily through the provision
of technical and capital assistance under the Second and Fourth Highway Pro-
jects. Some progress was achieved in terms of improvements in the set-up of
the maintenance organization, warehouse operations, development of annual work
programs, and the preparation of a comprehensive five year maintenance program
that serves as the basis for the proposed project. However, despite these
sizable technical assistance inputs, ample manpower and an equipment fleet of
some 250 units, the minimum road maintenance needs have not been met due to
insufficient recurrent funding, frequent personnel ch&nges, inefficient fleet
management and shortcomings in financial management which have resulted in
widespread waste and diversion of scarce resources. These deficiencies will
be addressed under the proposed project as discussed in Chapter III.
6. Financial Management Bureau
2.20     The accounting structure currently in use provides little information
to MPW management that could be used to monitor performance, identify problems
and take corrective action. The present system is limited to appropriation
and allotment of budget funds to various MPW units and on ensuring that the
complex of clearances, authorizations and signatures have been satisfactorily
obtained before funds are expended. With a Project Preparation Facility
advance, MPW has engaged consultants to develop a modern cost accounting and
performance budgeting system to be introduced under the project, which would
allow improved planning, budgeting, control and verification of MPW's opera-
tions (para. 3.03).
F. Highway Financing
2.21     Highway maintenance is financed from the Recurrent Budget while
highway investments are included in the Development Budget which is largely
made up of grants and credits from bilateral and multilateral aid programs.
Annual highway investments averaged about US$20 million during the First Plan
period but have dropped to less than US$5 million since 1981/82. Recurrent
maintenance funding was adequate in the mid-1970s but has in recent years
become increasingly insufficient to maintain the expanded network.
2.22     Recurrent annual maintenance expenditures financed from the general
budget steadily increased from about US$5.5 million in 1976/77 to US$ 8.6
million in 1981/82 but decreased to an estimated US$6.2 million in 1982/83, as
shown below:

Source: Operations Bureau and Planning and Programming Bureau, Ministry of Public
Works, 1982.
Immediately after taking office in 1980, the new Government doubled the mini-
mum wage rate which dramatically altered the composition of maintenance expen-
ditures. In 1976/77 about US$3.4 million or 62 percent went for non-personnel
expenses (fuel, spare parts, materials, etc.) compared to only US$1.7 million
or 20 percent in 1981/82 and estimated to have been even lower in 1982/83.
This decline becomes even more dramatic when seen against the background of a
more than fourfold increase in fuel prices over the referenced period. Under
a Standby Agreement with the IMF, the Government agreed for 1982/83 to a 15
percent across-the-board cut in recurrent expenditures from 1981/82 levels,
leaving it to the individual ministries to attain this reduction by whatever
means they deemed appropriate. As a first result, the allocation for person-
nel costs in the Operations Bureau was initially reduced from US$6.9 million
to US$6.4 million through pensioning off of some staff, while non-personnel
costs were cut from US$1.7 million to US$0.7 million, or less than 10 percent
of the total maintenance budget.
2.23.    However, these allocations were significantly revised again in the
course of the fiscal year, following the Government's decision in December
1982 to reduce civil servants' pay scales as of January 1983 by 16-25 percent,
depending on grade. This measure was prompted by mounting budgetary pres-
sures, caused by a shortfall in revenues, and the realization that the limited
allocations for logistics in MPW's and other ministries' budgets did not even
allow them to sustain minimum levels of operations. In its announcement of
the salary cut, the Government explicitly stated that it had opted for equit-
able sharing by all civil servants of the burden of the required budget ad-
justment rather than to resort to mass lay-offs. As a result of the budget
realignment total resources allocated to maintenance in 1982/83 were reduced
from US$7.2 million to an estimated US$6.2 million, while funding for non-
personnel expenditures increased to about US$1.1 million, or about 18 percent
of total. Personnel expenditures were meanwhile reduced to US$5.1 million,



- 12 -
the lowest level in three years. Nevertheless this level of funding is total-
ly inadequate for maintenance needs which wouldl under normal circumstances (no
deferred maintenance) require some US$11 million for non-personnel expendi-
tures. The project will take the first step in a longer term effort to re-
store maintenance funding to appropriate levels and to further restructure the
maintenance budget through gradual reduction of excessive payroll costs
(paras. 3.06 and 3.19).
2.24     Road users contribute to Government re!venues through taxes and duties
on fuel, lubricants, vehicles and spare parts, and through license and regis-
tration fees. In 1981, fuel taxes were increased from 12 cents to 32 cents
per US gallon of gasoline and from 10 cents to 30 cents per US gallon of
gasoil. Duties on vehicles range from 23 percent of cif prices for buses and
light trucks to 35 percent for heavy trucks; duty on spare parts is 40 percent
of their cif price. The rise in fuel taxes greatly increased total revenues
from road user charges from an estimated US$12.3 millior. in 1980/81 to about
US$17.8 million in 1981/82. At the start of fiscal year 1983/84 the gasoline
tax was increased to 92 cents per US gallon, expected to generate an addition-
al US$11 million in tax revenues. Thus, the level of road user taxes is
adequate since in addition to covering maintenance expenditures, including
expected increases, road user revenues make a significant contribution to the
capital costs of the network as can be seen from Annex 2-2.
2.25     As a consequence of the reduced maintenance funding in recent years,
fleet maintenance has been inadequate, routine maintenance only partial and
periodic maintenance negligible, resulting in accelerated erosion of capital
invested in roads and equipment, and increased transportation costs. Liberia
is fortunate in that most of its paved network is of relatively recent origin
and therefore poses no immediate major maintenance problem. However, the
situation with respect to the main gravel network is far less comforting;
consultants employed under the Fourth Highway Project estimated that a period-
ic maintenance backlog of some 775 miles has developed. A principal objective
of the proposed project is to stop further deterioration of the network and
make a start with the elimination of the maintenance backlog.
III. THE PROJECT
A. Objectives
3.01     As originally conceived, the proposed project was to continue upgrad-
ing the primary network by paving road sections identified and prepared under
earlier projects, and further improve road main';enance. However, in view of
the Government's limited ability to provide counterpart funds for new road
construction, the deterioration in MPW's managerient capability and the inade-
quacy of present maintenance operations, it was agreed with the Government
that the proposed project, prepared by MPW with the assistance of consultants
under the Fourth Highway Project, should focus on:
(i)     strengthening of MPW's technical and financial management capabil-
ity to ensure efficient use of scarce available resources for the
development and maintenance of Liberia's public road network; and



- 13 -
(ii)    preservation of past investments in highway infrastructure by
securing adequate funding for minimum routine maintenance and by
taking a first step toward elimination of the periodic maintenance
backlog.
B. Description
3.02     To attain the above objectives the proposed project consists of:
(i)    the development and implementation of a medium term program for
improvement of MPW's managerial and financial accountability,
including related technical assistance and training;
(ii)   a three year road maintenance program to include:
(a)     routine maintenance by force account to cover the all-
weather network (2,450 miles) and gradually be extended to
include the dry weather network (2,280 miles);
(b)     periodic maintenance on about 450 miles of gravel roads by
force account (350 miles) and by contract (100 miles);
(c)     basic rehabilitation of workshop facilities, including
replacement of ancillary equipment and hand tools;
(d)     limited additions to the road maintenance equipment fleet
and overhaul of some of the existing equipment;
(e)     consulting services to: (alpha) assist the Operations
Bureau in improving the efficiency of road maintenance
operations; (beta) prepare in collaboration with the PPB a
follow-up maintenance program; and (gamma) auditing ser-
vices to audit project expenditures; and
(f)     fellowships.
1. Strengthening of MPW Management
3.03     The Ministry has prepared a medium term management strengthening
program outline, aimed at better coordination between its various bureaus
through improved management information flows, both technical and financial;
and the improvement of MPW's efficiency in carrying out its assignments on
time and within established budgets. The program rests on the design of a
modern cost accounting system coupled with changed responsibilities in the MPW
structure to monitor and use the management information that would be gene-
rated. A PPF advance of US$340,000 was approved in May 1983 to hire consul-
tants to assist the Government in further developing an appropriate management
information system, prior to project start-up. The project will provide for
additional technical assistance, particularly in the accounting area but also
in general management to implement the program (,para. 3.11) and conduct on the
job training. The Government agreed during negotiations that a newly dev-
eloped accounting system acceptable to the Association, will become operation-
al not later than July 1, 1984 and that as of fiscal year 1984/85, budgets
would be recast along functional lines.



- 14 -
2.  Routine Maintenance
3.04     The routine maintenance program covers initially the entire all-
weather road network of 2,450 miles and expands to include the 2,280 miles of
dry weather roads by the end of the project period.  In view of the financing
constraints, routine maintenance activities have been set at minimum standards
compatible with road type and traffic levels.  Priority will be given to
preservation of recent large capital investments in the paved network.
3.05     Maintenance operations such as heavy bush clearing, grading, com-
pacting and anti-corrugation brushing will be :Largely mechanized while other
operations such as patching, pot-hole filling, emergency repairs and shoulder
and structure clearing will mostly be carried out by manual labor. Each main-
tenance district will organize specialized light mechanized units and labor
gangs to carry out the various maintenance tasks as per the annual routine
maintenance programs to be approved (para. 3. 23).
3.06     Even with the expected increase in maintenance activities under the
project, redundancies in certain staff categories, notably unskilled laborers
and mechanical workers, will continue to exist. However, staff reductions
through lay-offs at this time would be difficult for socio-political reasons
in light of Government's recent explicit pronouncement on its employment
policy (para. 2.23).  Therefore, desirable adjustments in staffing levels can
only be brought about gradually and primarily through normal attrition. Over
the past few years, staff turnover has been considerable and it is considered
feasible to reduce overall maintenance staff by about 75 per annum, while at
the same time still leaving some room for recruitment of a limited number of
qualified new staff for key positions. This strategy could bring total maint-
enance staffing down from 2,200 to about 1,950 by the end of the project
period. As a further adjustment measure MPW intends to change the employment
status of about 800 unskilled maintenance workers from permanent to temporary
staff, only to be hired during the six-month dry season. This would reduce
personnel cost by about US$800,000 per annum. The corresponding payroll
savings from both staff measures, estimated at about US$3.0 million over the
project implementation period, are to be allocated to the maintenance operat-
ing budget, thereby significantly reducing Government's incremental mainte-
nance funding requirements (para. 3.19).
3. Periodic Maintenance of Gravel Roads
3.07     Some of the gravel roads have deteriorated to the extent that traffic
interruptions occur during the rainy season; a more substantial effort than
just regravelling, including drainage improvement and some earthworks is
needed to bring these roads back to an acceptable condition before routine
maintenance can be carried out effectively. It is estimated that a total of
775 miles of gravel roads will require rehabilitation or regravelling. About
450 miles of gravel roads, the most urgently in need of rehabilitation or
regravelling, are included in the project and are listed in Annex 3-1. Road
upgrading works will be limited to an absolute minimum with a view to maximize
regravelling mileage. During negotiations, Government agreed to the list and
to limit upgrading earthworks to an average of 10 percent of total regravell-
ing volume to be carried out.



- 15 -
3.08     The Operations Bureau will deploy three brigades (one in each re-
gion), using existing equipment and staff, to regravel about 350 miles by
force account; a specialized drainage crew will be set-up to carry out drain-
age improvements ahead of the brigades. In addition about 100 miles will be
regravelled by contractors. Since it is important that the deferred periodic
maintenance is carried out on schedule to prevent further deterioration, the
Government agreed during negotiations that: (i) the output of the regravell-
ing brigades will be reviewed with the Association every six months starting
December 1984; and (ii) should the assessed output be less than anticipated,
the amount of work to be carried out by contract will be increased.
4. Workshops and Equipment
3.09     The most recent fleet condition inventory shows that the Operations
Bureau's equipment fleet is adequate in numbers and basic condition, but
somewhat unbalanced. Further, a substantial number of the units is deadlined
awaiting minor repairs and some require major overhaul. Some additional water
tankers and lube trucks, and a few specialty items as listed in Annex 3-2
would be procured to provide balanced equipment for the maintenance brigades;
the list was agreed upon at negotiations. The project would also equip labo-
rers with the necessary hand tools. The units for which overhaul is justified
will be reconditioned either under contract with authorized dealers or in the
MPW workshops, which will also undertake the minor repairs. During negotia-
tions, the Government agreed to use the existing maintenance equipment fleet
of operable and repairable units exclusively for the purposes of the project.
3.10     MPW's workshop structures are acceptable for the expected workload
but are in poor working condition because of lack of utilities, equipment and
tools. The project will meet the basic workshop needs in terms of reliable
water, electricity, compressed air and fuel dispensing services, workshop
equipment, hand tools and radio equipment (Annex 3-2). The list was agreed at
negotiations.
5. Technical Assistance
3.11     Consultants will be appointed to assist MPW in the implementation of
the management information system being developed under the PPF advance, the
strengthening of its management capability in key areas, the execution of the
road maintenance program, and the preparation of a follow-up maintenance
project. The team will consist of a senior road maintenance engineer (18 man-
months); a cost accountant (18 man-months); an equipment management specialist
(18 man-months); a warehouse/procurement specialist (12 man-months); three
road maintenance superintendents (54 man-months); and three mechanical super-
intendents (54 man-months), for a total of 174 man-months. The experts will
assume direct operational responsibilities and authority within MPW's admini-
stration, and will provide on-the-job training to local counterpart staff.
One road maintenance superintendent and one mechanical superintendent will be
assigned to each of the three regions to assist the Operations Bureau in
improving field operations and procedures for routine and periodic mainte-
nance, ensuring optimum utilization of equipment, facilities, manpower and
materials in their respective regions. During negotiations the Government
agreed to: (i) hire the experts from a single firm satisfactory to the



- 16 -
Association to ensure maximum coordination and continuity between the various
technical assistance activities; and (ii) the terms of reference as outlined
in Annex 3-3.
3.12     In addition, the consultants shall, in collaboration with the PPB and
with the help of short term specialists (10 man-months), carry out a road
maintenance study in preparation for an expanded maintenance program which
could be implemented under a follow-up project. The study will make a compre-
hensive assessment of the maintenance needs of the network, covering a five
year period, and formulate specific recommendations on their method of execu-
tion (contract versus force account); equipment, facilities and manpower
requirements at all levels for the part to be carried out by force account;
and funding needs. Outline terms of reference for the study are given in
Annex 3-4 and have been agreed with Government during negotiations.
6. Audits
3.13     Independent auditors will be appointed for annual verification of the
propriety of project expenditures, including those channeled through the
revolving fund. As part of the review the auditors will also give their
opinion on the adequacy of the unit rates for the various maintenance opera-
tions adopted for the purpose of disbursement of asasit proceeds (para.
3.25). During negotiations the Government agreed that, starting with the
1983/84 accounts, it would engage independent auditors on terms and conditions
acceptable to the Association, to audit project expenditures and send to the
Association the audited accounts together with the auditors' report, within
four months after the closing of each fiscal year.
7. Fellowships
3.14     In support of the longer term effort to strengthen MPW's management
capability, the project will provide a limited number of scholarships for
advanced training of mechanics to prepare them for eventual assignment in
supervisory positions in MPW's workshop organization, as well as for some
selected candidates for university studies in the field of accounting and
business administration.
C. Cost Estimates
3.15     The total cost of the project, net of taxes and duties, is estimated
at US$19.4 million, of which about US$14.5 million represent capital costs and
about US$4.9 million incremental recurrent costs Total foreign costs amount
to US$15.5 million (80%) and local costs, net of taxes and duties, to about
US$3.8 million. Non-waived taxes and duties are estimated at US$0.7
million. Detailed estimates of project costs are presented in the following
Table and those of routine maintenance operating costs in Annex 3-5.

3.16     Cost estimates for equipment are based on recent bids received by MPW
and local dealers' quotations.  The cost of periodic maintenance of gravel
roads by contractor is based on the mission's best estimate as no recent bids
for similar works are available. The detailed cost estimates of periodic and
routine maintenance operations (excluding local personnel cost and equipment
depreciation) have been developed by MPW with the assistance of consultants
Sauti-ICE of Italy. Man-month costs of consulting services including salary,
overheads, profit, as well as international travel, local subsistence and
other minor expenses, are expected to average about US$13,000; rates are in
line with recent experience in Liberia. In addition, contract costs for
consulting services include the cost of vehicles for local transportation and
equipment for roughness measurements to be used in the preparation of a
follow-up maintenance project.
3.17     Base cost estimates are as of November 1983 and price contingencies
amounting to about 13% of total base cost, including physical contingencies,
have been calculated using the following expected inflation rates: 8% in
1983; 7.5% in 1984; 7% in 1985 and 6% in 1986. Physical contingencies have
been applied as follows: 10% on road maintenance and workshop equipment; 10%
on equipment overhaul by contract; 10% on spare parts for equipment overhaul
by force account; and 5% on technical assistance. No physical contingencies
have been taken into account on the periodic and routine maintenance elements
since these are based on a flexible program.
D. Financing
3.18     The Association and USAID will finance 75% of total project cost, net
of taxes. The IDA Credit of US$11.4 million equivalent will cover 66% of
project capital costs and 38% of incremental recurrent cost of materials on a
declining basis, namely, 60% of incremental recurrent expenditures for mater-
ials made before January 1, 1985, 40% in 1985, and 20% thereafter. The above
percentages are equivalent to 30% of estimated total recurrent expenditures
for materials made before January 1, 1985, 24% in 1985 and 15% thereafter
(Annex 3-5). The USAID grant of US$3.1 million will finance 21% of project
capital costs. The Government is expected to finance US$4.9 million, net of
taxes, or 25% of total project costs; of this USS0.6 million represent royal-
ties on laterite 1/. In addition, the Government will continue to finance the
payroll of its maintenance staff, currently amounting to about US$5 million
per annum, as well as minor expenses for equipment replacement and administra-
tive overheads, estimated at US$1.5 million over the project period. A condi-
tion of effectiveness of the proposed IDA Credit will be that the Government
makes satisfactory arrangements for obtaining the USAID grant. Details of
project financing are given in Annexes 3-5 and 3-6 and are summarized below.
1/ Private land owners are legally entitled to cDmpensation for
laterite extracted from their land. The present royalty is US$.50 per
cubic yard; however, the new Government has suspended payment of all
claims, pending a revision of the system. Allowance for the
corresponding payment has been made, nevertheless, under the project.

3.19      Under the project the Government will increase its maintenance expen-
ditures (excluding payroll, administrative overheads and equipment replace-
ment) from US$0.9 million in FY83 (before project start), to US$1.4 million in
the second half of FY84, US$2.8 million in FY85, US$3.1 million in FY86 and
US$1.6 million in the first half of FY87 (Annex 3-6). The additional amounts
required from Government for operating expenditures will, to a large extent,
be offset by personnel cost savings from staff reductions to the tune of about
US$3.0 million over the project period (para. 3.06). During negotiations the
Government agreed to: (i) provide the minimum annual allocations for mainte-
nance during project implementation as set out in Annex 3-6; (ii) include the
amounts for routine and periodic maintenance in the Recurrent Budget as of



- 20 -
FY85, when the latter has been restructured along functional lines (para.
3.03); (iii) send for review to the Association, not later than May 15 of
each year until five years after completion of the project, the proposed road
maintenance budget for the following fiscal year;  and (iv) ensure that no
sector activities would be undertaken that woulLd impair the efficient carrying
out of the project.
3.20     Experience with the Feeder Roads Project has shown that under the
prevailing budgetary constraints the Government is hard put to prefinance the
Loan share of operating expenses for force account operations, which are too
small for Procedure III payments. As a consequence of late payments, sup-
pliers become reluctant and slow in processing of orders, resulting in imple-
mentation delays. Therefore, it was agreed during negotiations to establish a
revolving fund under the project, similar to the one in use under the Feeder
Roads Project, on the following terms and conditions:  the Government will
open a Project Account and a Special Account in a local bank acceptable to the
Association; make an initial deposit equivalent; to US$400,000 in the Project
Account; channel all expenditures for routine and force account periodic
maintenance (with the exception of salaries and claims for laterite royalties)
through the revolving fund; quarterly replenish withdrawals from the Project
Account; increase the initial deposit to US$600,000 equivalent by December
1984; and have the accounts periodically audited by external auditors accept-
able to the Association. Opening of the Project Account and the Special
Account, and Government's initial deposit of US$400,000 equivalent in the
Project Account will be conditions of Credit effectiveness. Upon Credit
effectiveness the Association will make an advEnce disbursement of US$600,000
into the Special Account and will replenish eligible drawings from the advance
disbursement upon receipt of Government withdrawal applications, accompanied
by appropriate supporting documentation including a certified statement that
Government has replenished its drawings from the Project Account during the
preceeding quarter.
E. Implementation and Reporting Requirements
3.21     MPW, through its administrative and technical services, will be
responsible for all project elements.   The project would be implemented over
a three year period; under a PPF advance the technical assistance was started
in September 1983. The expected implementation schedule for the major activi-
ties of the project is shown in Annex 3-7 and has been discussed and agreed at
negotiations.
3.22     Implementation of the routine maintenance program will increase with
equipment availability. The existing equipment is expected to be repaired and
fully operational at the start of the 1984/85 dry season.   The performance
accounting system to be developed and implemented with the assistance of
consultants (para. 3.03) will enable MPW management to closely monitor the
efficiency of road maintenance operations and take corrective action where
required.
3.23     At negotiations the Government agreed to submit to the Association by
May 15 of each year of project implementation cnd for five years thereafter,
for its review, a program of routine and periodic maintenance to be carried
ou; in the following fiscal year. Government also agreed on progress report-
ing requirements as set out in Annex 3-8, which should include target indices



- 21 -
for measuring implementation, and the submission of a project completion
report, in a form satisfactory to the Association, not later than six months
after the closing date of the Credit.

Contract periodic maintenance (US$2.9 million) and fellowships (US$0.2
million) are co-financed by USAID and will follow USAID procedures. Highway
maintenance equipment (US$0.7 million), and non-propietary spare parts and
road building materials (US$3.0 million) will be grouped whenever possible
into contracts valued at US$60,000 or more and will be procured through ICB.
A margin of preference equal to 15% of the cif bid price of imported goods or
the actual customs duties and import taxes, whichever is less, will be allowed
for domestic manufacturers. Contracts for miscellaneous equipment, tools,
spare parts and materials valued at less than US$60,000 will be purchased
through LCB, up to an aggregate limit of US$1.5 million. Minor items of
essential and urgently needed spare parts and materials costing less than
US$10,000 per purchase and aggregating not more than US$500,000 may be pro-
cured by local shopping or by direct purchase in the case of a single local
supplier. Equipment overhaul by contract (up to US$0.6 million) will be
carried out by authorized dealers and proprietary spare parts (US$3.9 million)
will be procured from the original manufacturers, under directly negotiated
contracts satisfactory to the Association. Fuel (US$J.6 million) will be
procured through LCB from local distribution companies, which obtain their
products from the Government-owned refinery. Consultants will be selected in
accordance with IDA guidelines. All IDA-financed works contracts, and goods
contracts over US$60,000 each, will be subject to prior review by the Associa-
tion, which will cover about 80% of the total value of such contracts. Other
contracts will be subject to selective post-award reviews. During negotia-
tions, the procurement arrangements were reviewed and agreed upon.
G. Disbursements
3.25     Disbursements from the Credit will be made as follows:

Disbursement applications for equipment, equipment overhaul by contract, spare
parts for equipment overhaul and consultants' services will be fully
documented. Withdrawal requests for operating costs of routine and periodic
maintenance by force account will be based on unit costs of routine and
periodic maintenance operations as given in Annex 3-9, and with the agreement
of the Association, adjusted from time to time to reflect actual costs as
established under the analytical accounting system to be introduced under the
project; the application will be accompanied by a statement signed by the
Assistant Minister of the Operations Bureau, indicating the referenced period
and giving the quantities of the various road maintenance operations carried
out on each identified road. During audit inspections (para. 3.13), unit cost
of individual maintenance operations will be checked for cost efficiency. The
Government will channel op-rating expenditures for routine and periodic main-
tenance by force account, other than personnel cost and laterite claims,
through the revolving fund.
3.26     The projected schedule of disbursements from the IDA Credit is pre-
sented in Annex 3-10. The project basically consists of a three year time
slice of the road maintenance operations of MPW and its disbursement profile
is therefore much steeper than the standard profile for highway projects which
relates more to civil works construction projects. The PPF advance of
US$340,000 has been included as fully repaid at effectiveness. Taking into
account some delay in implementation and processing of withdrawal applica-
tions, it is assumed that the proceeds of the Credit would be fully disbursed
after four years.
IV. ECONOMIC EVALUATION
A. General
4.01     Although some progress was achieved in road maintenance under pre-
vious projects through technical and capital assistance, these advances could
not be sustained due to the progressive decline in the availability of opera-
ting funds in recent years and the deterioration in management capability as a
result of the exodus of experienced senior staff subsequent to the 1980 change
in Government. Consequently, the efficiency and coverage of maintenance
operations have become increasingly inadequate leading to accelerated erosion
of infrastructure and rising transport costs. The proposed project is a step
in a longer term effort to reverse this trend and is expected to rebuild the
management capacity of the executing agency, ensure minimum acceptable funding
for current operations and carry out priority periodic maintenance. Better
maintenance of the road network will yield widely distributed quantifiable and
non-quantifiable economic and social benefits. The principal quantifiable
benefits of the project will be vehicle operating cost (VOC) savings and
reduced investment outlays for road reconstruction and strengthening. Bene-
fits from lower transport costs would initially accrue to transporters but
will, in the competitive environment, be passed on to consumers and producers
in the form of lower transport tariffs for goods and passengers. The present
project design is considered the least cost solution; a possible project
alternative whereby all maintenance activities are contracted out would be



- 24 -
more costly as, in the short term, existing MPW maintenance equipment and
manpower cannot readily be put to alternative productive uses.
B. Economic Analysis of the Road Maintenance Program
4.02      Without the project it is assumed that Government funding for mainte-
nance would remain at FY83 levels, allowing only manual side brushing, drain-
age cleaning, some grading and limited bituminous patching. The available
equipment with a replacement value of about US$20 million would stay largely
immobilized and maintenance staff costing about US$5.0 million per annum
severely underutilized. With the project MPW is expected to be able to carry
out normal routine maintenance on the entire all weather road network (2,450
miles), emergency repairs on the more trafficked roads of the dry weather
network, as well as periodic maintenance on about 450 miles of priority later-
ite roads.
4.03      Project costs and benefits were calculated in September 1982 prices,
net of taxes. Costs include incremental force account operating costs for
routine and periodic mainterance, payments to contractors for regravelling
works, equipment and tools, and technical assistance for the maintenance
program, together accounting for 95% of project costs. The only benefits
taken into consideration were VOC savings.  Therefore, the economic analysis
results are conservative.
4.04      The road maintenance strategy and VOC savings were assessed using the
methodology developed under the Bank and Transport and Road Research Labora-
tory (TRRL) research programs in Kenya.  MPW, with the assistance of consul-
tants, carried out a road inventory of the al:L weather network, dividing it
into sections according to surface type, traffic density and road condition.
The results of the inventory are summarized in Annex 4-1. VOC savings were
calculated as the difference between VOC on the rapidly deteriorating network
under current maintenance levels and those resulting from implementation of
the project's maintenance strategy, applying road deterioration parameters and
user cost relationships developed by TRRL (Annex 4-2).
4.05      No recent comprehensive traffic counts are available; the national
traffic survey, presently underway, has produced partial data for 1981 which
would indicate a decline in traffic. However, the results are distorted by
the special circumstances that prevailed after April 1980, including the
imposition of travel restrictions until April 1982. The situation has now
returned to normal and therefore, for the purpose of the economic analysis,
use has been made of the consultant's traffic estimates for 1981 based on
extrapolation of earlier traffic data. Between 1981 and 1983 traffic levels
are assumed constant considering the depressed state of the economy and beyond
1983 resumed traffic growth is projected at a modest 3% per annum.  Estimated
1981 average daily traffic on the all weather road network is given in Annex
4-3.
4.06      Given that the small incremental out-lays for operating expenses
enable the realization of benefits on comparat:ively large past, investments in
road infrastructure and equipment, and make the annual maintenance payroll
productive, the project's benefit/cost ratio Ls a high 6:1 at a 12% discount
rate while the ERR well exceeds 100%. The benefit/cost ratio on the paved
network is 4.8:1 and on the gravel network 6.1 :1. Even though routine



- 25 -
maintenance cannot realistically be separated from periodic maintenance, a
cross check on the advantages of the regravelling program was carried out,
giving a benefit/cost ratio of 7.4:1. The high ratio is explained by the fact
that the regravelling program is limited to sections with highest traffic
density (200 vpd or more) and most deteriorated road condition. In fact some
of the sections have already lost all their surface material and reverted to
earth rc ad standards, while the others would do so in the near future, without
the project.
4.07     Even with large changes in the underlying assumptions, the project
would remain justified. With a 100% increase in costs or a 50% reduction in
benefits, the project's benefit/cost ratio would still be 3:1, while the ERR
remains at over 100%. A 50% reduction in benefits of improved paved road
maintenance, reduces the benefit/cost ratio for this activity to 2.4:1 with
the ERR dropping to 94%.
C. Project Risks
4.08     The main risk of the project is that planned improvements in the
executing agency's management performance would not be fully realized or that
the Government would not be able to provide the necessary funds for the main-
tenance program, resulting in lower maintenance output. However, as seen from
the foregoing sensitivity analysis, even if only half of the planned mainte-
nance activities were carried out, the project still remains well justified.
V. AGREEMENTS REACHED AND RECOMMENDATION
5.01     During negotiations agreements were reached on the following:
(i)    installation and operation of weighbridges (para. 2.07);
(ii)   that an improved accounting system will be developed under the
project to be fully operational by FY1985, at which time the
Recurrent Budget would be recast along functional lines,
providing minimum targeted amounts (paras. 3.03 and 3.19);
(iii)  the overall program for periodic maintenance and the maximum
share for rehabilitation type earthworks (para. 3.07); semi-
annual review of physical progress in force account regravell-
ing (para. 3.08); review of annual work programs for routine
and periodic maintenance (para. 3.23);
(iv)   the repair and use of existing maintenance equipment (para.
3.09);
(v)    the lists of road maintenance equipment (para. 3.09) and
workshop equipment and tools (para. 3.10);
(vi)   that acceptable auditors shall be appointed to annually audit
the project accounts and submit their report within four
months of the fiscal year closing (para. 3.13);



- 26 -
(vii)  that by May 15 of each projec-t year, and for five years there-
after, the Government will exchange views with the Association
on the proposed maintenance budget for the next fiscal year
(para. 3.19);
(viii) the establishment of the revo:Lving fund, its operating
arrangements, and the increase in advance deposit in the
Project Account from US$400,000 equivalent to US$600,000
equivalent by December 1984 (para. 3.20);
(ix)   the project implementation schedule (para. 3.21) and reporting
requirements (para. 3.23); and
(x)    procurement and disbursement procedures (paras. 3.24 and
3.25); and the terms of reference and conditions of employment
of consultants (paras. 3.11 and 3.12).
5.02     At negotiations, the Government gave assurances that no sector activ-
ities would be undertaken that would impair the efficient carrying out of the
project (para. 3.19).
5.03     During negotiations, the Government agreed to the following condi-
tions of Credit effectiveness:
(i)    to make satisfactory arrangements for obtaining the USAID
grant (para.3.18); and
(ii)   to open the Project Account and the Special Account, and to
make an initial deposit of US$400,000 equivalent in the Pro-
ject Account (para. 3.20).
5.04     As satisfactory agreements on the above items have been obtained, the
proposed Project is suitable for a Credit of SDR 10.9 million (US$ 11.4
million equivalent) on standard IDA terms.

FIFTH HIGHWAY PROJECT
STAFF APPRAISAL REPORT
Outline Terms of Reference for Road Maintenance Study
I. OBJECTIVES
In collaboration with MPW's Planning and Programming Bureau and the
technical assistance team financed under the project, the Consultants will
prepare and justify a comprehensive follow-up road maintenance program. More
specifically the Consultants will:
(i)    carry out a complete inventory of the public road network,
including measurement of roughness for all main and secondary
roads, as well as, for selected paved roads: approximate
measurements of areas subject to moderate and heavy cracking,
and strength parameters by deflection measurements. From
this, identify sections where major rehabilitation efforts are
needed before normal cycles of routine and periodic main-
tenance can provide a satisfactory year-round level of
serviceability;
(ii)   review and make further recommendations on improvements in
operation and procedures of maintenance works that could lead
to better utilization of equipment, facilities, manpower and
materials, including recommendations on the most appropriate
mix of labor and equipment for the different maintenance
operations,
(iii)  determine the level of rehabilitation and maintenance for
different road types and traffic levels, incorporating an
assessment of the effect of different levels of maintenance on
vehicle operating costs as well as subsequent maintenance and
rehabilitation costs. If the economically optimal level of
the program is not considered feasible due to financial, mana-
gerial or other intractable constraints, a "constrained opti-
mum" program which is feasible and practicable will be devel-
oped in accordance with the principles of incremental cost-
benefit analysis. The economic analysis shall include an
assessment of the sensitivity of the main results to possible
variations in the scale or efficiency of the program, and an
assessment of the major risks in achieving the proposed
program.
(iv)   delineate the proposed program of maintenance and rehabili-
tation, including a timetable and associated resource require-
ments for those road sections requiring rehabilitation;
quality and quantity standards for each major maintenance
operation for principal classes of road types and traffic

combination thereof) with a view to the capacity of the local
and resident contracting industry;
(vii)  determine the Operations Bureau's total needs for road main-
tenance equipment, spare parts and workshop facilities in each
year to carry out their part of the program and determination
of purchase requirements for t:he above items as the balance of
total needs and of available stock;
