PAPUA AND NEW GUINEA
NEW BRITAIN SMALLHOLDER DEVELOPMENT PROJECT
SUMMARY
i.        The Administration of the Territory of Papua and New Guinea,
through the Government of the Commonwealth of Australia, has requested an
IDA credit to help finance a settlement project on the island of New Britain.
ii.       The project would provide some 580 families with holdings of about
15 acres each, on which they would be assisted to: plant and bring to ma-
turity eight acres of oil palms; construct a house; and develop a food garden.
Settlers would receive loans, in cash and kind, for the above purposes, and
would repay these with 6% interest over a period of eleven years, including
five years of grace. These loans would be made by the Papua and New Guinea
Development Bank. Settlers would sell their palm produce to an oil mill
Jointly owned by Government and private interests. Under an agreement with
Government, the mill would provide a guaranteed market for the output of the
settlement for a period of 25 years at prices that would be determined by a
formula mutually acceptable to Government and IDA.
iii.      The project, which would have an average annual net return to the
economy of about 9%, would open up a new area of fertile soils, and would
establish settlement techniques which would be annlicable throughout the
Territory and with other crops. At maturity the annual foreign exchange
value of palm produce from the settlement, all of which would be exported,
would be about US$1.2 million. Participants would earn about US$900 annually
from their oil palms, about double the average income for a laborer in the
commercial agricultural sector.
iv.       Project costs total US$3.3 million, of which the import element is
57%, about US$1.9 million.
v.        The project is suitable for an IDA credit of US$1.5 million.  The
borrower would be the Administration of the Territory of Papua and New Guinea
(Government). About US$660,000 of the credit would be on-lent by Government
to the Papua and New Guinea Development Bank at 1-1/4 % per annum interest,
and would be repaid within 25 years. These soft terms are justified because
the Development Bank is a new Government-owned institution, in need of capital
resources, whose profits can only be used for reserve or working capital pur-
poses. The remaining part of the credit would be used directly by Government
Departments for services to smallholders.






PAPUA AND NEW GUINEA
NEW BRITAIN SMALLHOLDER DEVELOPMENT PROJECT
I. INTRODUCTION
1.01      The Administration of the Territory of Papua and New Guinea (Gov-
ernment), through the Government of the Commonwealth of Australia, has re-
quested IDA assistance in the financing of oil palm, coconut and beef cattle
development, comprising:
- development of about 7,600 acres of smallholder and estate oil
palms;
- new planting and replanting on about 10,000 acres of existing
coconut estates;
- development and stocking of about 150,000 acres of private
beef cattle ranches, and the improvement of Government services
to the beef cattle industry.
Assistance in the identification and preparation of the three sub-projects
was given by Bank Economic Missions in 1963 and 1967. 1/
1.02      Based on the findings of a mission composed of Messrs. McMeekan
(Consultant), Eccles, Nelson, Palein (IDA), and Phillips (Consultant), which
visited Papua and New Guinea in January/February 1968, an IDA credit of uS$6
million was negotiated in early September 1968, with the reservation that it
would not be considered by the IDA Board until sufficient IDA funds became
available. Subsequently, following representations from the Government, it
was agreed that a smaller credit should be considered immediately for that
part of the project to which the Government gave the highest priority - a
settlement scheme on the island of New Britain for smallholders growing oil
palms. This scheme, the New Britain Smallholder Development Project, is the
subject of this report.
II. BACKGROUND
2.01      The Territory of Papua and New Guinea (Territory) is in the tropics
about 100 miles north of Australia.  It comprises the eastern half of the
island of New Guinea (mainland); nine major islands including New Britain
1/ The 1963 Mission's report was published: "The Economic Development of
the Territory of Panua and New Guinea", Johns Hopkins University Press,
Baltimore: 1964. The 1967 Mission's report, No. AS 129b, was issued by
Asia Department on August 25, 1967.



- 2 -
in the Bismarck Archipelago; and a large number of smaller islands (see
Map 1). Total land area is about 184,000 square miles, of which about 85%
is mainland. Much of the Territory is mountainous, with ridges on the main-
land rising to 15,000 ft and on the islands to 8,500 ft. Total population is
about 2.2 million including about 30,000 non-indigenes.
2.02      Papua, formerly a British Protectorate, and New Guinea, formerly
German and now a UN Trust Territory, are administered jointly by Australia.
The capital is Port Moresby. Australia, actively preparing the Territory for
Independence, continues to spend large sums on its administration and de-
velopment. In 1967/68, when total Government expenditure was A$131.1 million,
Australian grants-in-aid totalled A$77.6 million.
2.03      The Territory's economy is almost completely agricultural.  Agri-
culture earns nearly all export income, engages more than half the people
in naid employment, and most of the self-employed. The Gross National Prod-
uct (GNP) was estimated by the Bank Economic Mission in 1967 to be rising
rapidly at a real annual rate of about 12 to 13%. It was then about A$360
million (Us$400 million) per annum overall and about A$100 (US$110) per
capita average for the indigenous population. About half the GNP is derived
from the subsistence sector, mostly agricultural. About 40% of the remain-
der, in the monetized sector, also comes from agriculture; most of the rest
comes from Government services. Exports have risen fairly steadily in
volume and their annual value has increased from about A$37 million in 1960
to around A$50 million at the present time. Copra and coconut product ex-
ports are worth about 40% of the total, and coffee and cocoa about 20% each.
Rubber is next with 6%.
2.04      The 1963 Bank Economic Mission recommended further encouragement
of coconut, cocoa, rubber and cattle production through a strengthening of
extension services and the provision of credit. It endorsed Government
efforts to develop oil palms, pyrethrum and tea, crops which had not pre-
viously been grown in the Territory on a commercial scale. Government was,
and still is, anxious to diversify and increase the production of crops for
export and for import substitution, so that, on Independence, the Territory
would be in a better position to pay for the imports necessary for contin-
ued economic development.
2.05      Coconut is the most important crop but many palms are old and
overdue for replanting. Some estates have small parcels of unplanted land,
and a few of the larger ones are planting and replanting. However coconuts
take about 10 years to produce an economic crop and costs are rising, so the
smaller estates have little incentive to plant or replant. Copra production
in the indigenous sector has been expanding.
2.06      As to other crops mentioned in paras 2.03 and 2.04, further coffee
production is limited by the International Coffee Agreement; cocoa has suf-
fered a disease setback; and current low prices are discouraging to further
rubber develoDment. Government has, however, succeeded in interesting



- 3 -
private enterprise in oil palms, tea and pyrethrum. It continues to en-
courage the cattle industry by paying most of the costs of freight and
disease control for breeding cattle imports, and provides facilities to
train the local people in cattle management.
2.07      Government followed up the 1963 Mission's suggestion that a financ-
ing institution suited to the specific conditions of the Territory be or-
ganized to provide long-term credit, and its Panua and New Guinea Develop-
ment Bank opened for business in July 1967. Its credit services will be
made use of in this project.
III. OIL PALM DEVELOPMENT IN PAPUA AND NEW GUINEA
3.01      Oil palm develonment began in 1967 with the establishment of New
Britain Oil Palm Development Ltd, a joint venture which is owned in equal
shares by Government and a well-experienced plantation company, Harrisons
and Crosfield (Australia and New Zealand) Ltd. The new comnany has been
granted a 99-year lease on a 5,400 acre site between Talasea and Hoskins, on
the north coast of New Britain (Map 2), in an area where soils and climate
are very suitable for oil palms.  A nlantation of high-yielding oil palms is
now being developed by a wholly-owned subsidiary, Mosa Plantation Pty Ltd,
and an oil mill will be built by another wholly-owned subsidiary, Mosa Oil
Mill Pty Ltd. It is a condition of the lease that 80% of the site will be
planted with oil palms and that the oil mill, which must be completed within
five years, will have a minimum capacity sufficient for the output of 6,000
acres. The lease specifies that half of the mill capacity will be reserved
for smallholders.
3.02      Planting of Mosa estate started in 1968 and 3,000 acres will be
completed in 1971. Construction of the mill will start in 1969. Investment
costs of the estate and mill program are estimated at A$3.6 million (us$4.o
million).
3.03      The smallholder project described in this report would be adja-
cent to Mosa estate. The estate, under contract to Government, would arrange
certain services for the smallholders such as the supply of planting material,
and the oil mill would collect and process "fresh fruit bunches" 1/. Financ-
ing of New Britain Oil Palm Development Ltd is adequate and its two subsidi-
aries will be able to play their role in the Droject. However, assurances
have been obtained that Government would make alternative arrangements for
processing if the companies were unable to fulfil their contractual obligations
(see para 7.02 for further details).
1/ Fresh fruit bunches (ffb) - the saleable product of the oil palm - are
clusters of individual fruits. Each fruit consists of a nut, which con-
tains the palm kernel, surrounded by oily flesh from which palm oil is
extracted.



- 4 -
3.04      Oil palm develoDment in the Mosa area will require improvements in
the existing infrastructure. All palm oil and kernels produced will be ex-
ported from New Britain, and thus require the construction of a small port
and related facilities. Specifically, requirements are:
- construction of a small port in San Remo Bay comprising a wharf,
three dolphins for ocean-going freighters, sheds and palm oil
storage tanks and numping facilities.
- completion of 16 miles of road from the Mosa mill to the port
site and construction of a bridge over the Dagi River.
The roads, bridge, wharf, dolphins and sheds would be constructed and opera-
ted by Government; the palm oil storage tanks and pumping facilities would be
the responsibility of the klosa Oil Mill Pty. The total cost of this program
is estimated at Atl.4 million (US$1.6 million), and minimum palm oil loading
facilities would be required by mid-1971. Since the viability of the small-
holder project is dependent upon these facilities (as is that of the Mosa
estate) assurances have been obtained from the Government that they would be
constructed, and that adequate port loading facilities would be operative by
mid-1971.
IV. THE PROJECT AREA
4.01      The project area lies close to Mosa village near the north coast
of New Britain between the communities of Talasea and Hoskins (Mans 1 and 2).
It has a very low resident population.
Comunications
4.02      Mosa is about 20 miles by all-weather road from a grass airstrip,
suitable for DC3s and similar aircraft, at Hoskins: Trans-Australian Air-
lines schedule regular flights from Hoskins to Talasea and the ports of
Rabaul and Lae. Until the completion of the new facilities at San Remo Bay
(para 3.04) heavy supplies will be brought ashore by rafts from ships lying
off-shore near Buluma, about half-way between Mosa and Hoskins. Radio-
telephone facilities are available at Hoskins.
Topography, Soils and Climate
4.03      Topography is level and well suited to tree crop and food crop pro-
duction. Soils are volcanic and free draining. They generally have a light
texture and a loamy surface but there are some areas which are stony or clayey.
These soils provide a good rooting medium and their nutrient status is satis-
factory, although it is anticipated that fertilizers will be necessary to
achieve maximum crop yields.
4.o4      Rainfall records from stations in the general nroject area--
Hoskins, Talasea and Numundo-- indicate a rainfall in the settlement area of



- 5 -
between 100 and 170 inches annually. Distribution is generally good, al-
though a distinct dry season occurs May through August. Even in these
months, however, rainfall averages 3-4 inches monthly. Water deficits might
occur on occasions but would not seriously impede growth nor production of
fruit.  Temneratures, ranging between 700 and 800 F, and sunlight, totalling
about 2,000 hours annually, are ideal for oil palms.
4.05      Topography, soil, and climatic conditions are thus very suitable
for oil palm cultivation. In the opinion of Harrisons and Crosfield --
who have considerable experience of oil palms in Malaysia and Indonesia --
growing conditions are as good as, if not better than, the best conditions
for oil palms in Malaysia.
Vegetation
4.o6      The natural vegetation is tropical rain forest.  Logging by con-
tractors has already started and most of the marketable timber will be ex-
tracted prior to clearing.
Water supply and Health
4.07      Good supplies of water are available from the all-season Dagi, Ru,
Lamegi and Ganok rivers which traverse the project area. Malaria, which in
the past has been responsible for the low population, is no longer a serious
constraint on development due to the general use of malaria suppressants.
Land Tenure
h.o8      The Land Ordinance (1Q62-1966) governs land tenure in Papua and
New Guinea. Apart from some freehold titles issued during the German ad-
ministration of New Guinea, land may be owned only by the indigenous popula-
tion -- "native land" -- and by the Government. All land to which the Gov-
ernment cannot show rightful title is considered as "native land". The
Government can acquire "native land", either by negotiated purchase or by
compulsory purchase, and may lease land acquired in either way to private
individuals or companies. Usually such leases are for 99 years. Land
needed for the project has been purchased by the Government from the local
tribe -- the tribe owns large tracts of land which will be more than suf-
ficient for its needs in the foreseeable future.
V. THE PROJECT
A. Project Definition
5.01      The project involves:
- bringing about 580 families from other parts of the Territory
and settling them at Mosa, each on a holding having about 15
acres of land suitable for oil palm cultivation;



- 6 -
- establishing, within three years of settlement, eight acres of
oil palms on each holding -- a total of 4,640 acres of oil palms;
- erecting permanent settler houses and establishing food gardens
on each holding;
- providing long-term loans to settlers for the above purposes,
through the Papua and New Guinea Development Bank;
- providing a suitable infrastructure for the settlement area; and
- providing necessary health, education and welfare service for the
settlers.
The project also includes the Drovision of adequate processing and export
handling facilities, as already described in Chapter III.
B. Pattern of Settlement
5.02      The settlement would be developed in three blocks totalling some
15,000 acres, which would border three sides of the 5,400 acre Nahavio block
leased by New Britain Oil Palm Development Ltd (Map 2).  The Kapore and
Tamba blocks, totalling about 7,500 acres, have been subdivided already into
about 310 holdings, each having about 15 acres of land suitable for oil palm
cultivation, with provision made for roads and service areas. Settlers
arrived on these holdings in the latter half of 1968. A further 270 hold-
ings have been tentatively demarcated in the third block -- Sarakolok/
Lakiemata -- of about 7,500 acres, and these would be allocated to settlers
in the second quarter of 1969.
5.03      Settlers would live on their holdings, and not in a central village.
Initially they would be housed in temporary accommodation, subsequently con-
structing and moving to their own houses.  A full range of social services
would be provided for settlers, importantly education and health. These
services generally would be superior to those provided for established com-
munities of a similar size in Papua and New Guinea.
C. Development Schedule
Land Clearing
5.04      Saleable timber will have been removed from the forest which covers
most of the settlement area. Clearing of the remaining timber is relatively
inexpensive -- felling, stacking and burning on the Mosa Plantation costs
about A$35 (US$39) per acre, even though many of the workers have to be
transported by air to the site. Government pre-clears -- felling only, at



- 7 -
a cost of about At12.50 (Us$14) per acre -- six acres of each holding, leav-
ing the settler to complete the clearing operation. These six acres will be
planted with palms during the first two years. Subsequently, the settler
would have to completely fell and clear the two acres for his third year's
planting, the 1-2 acres needed for his food garden, and any additional area
of his holding on which he wished to plant either more oil palms or other
cross. Pre-clearing is being carried out by contract labor brought in from
outside the settlement area; many of the settlers work in these contract
gangs before they are allocated a holding. Forest clearing is traditional
work in the Territory and no problems are envisaged in settlers falling
behind on their clearing schedules. The overall clearing program for oil
palm slanting is shown in the following table:
1967/68  1968/69  1969/70  1970/71  Total
- - - - - - - - - acres - - - - - - - - -
Pre-clearing by Government            1,860    1,620       -        -      3,480

Total land cleared for oil palms:   4,640
5.05      At the time of the visit of the anpraisal mission in January/
February 1968, the above program was slightly in advance of schedule.
Planting Program
5.06      Each settler would plant three acres of oil palms under supervision
during his first year of occupation, three more during the second and two in
the third, making eight in all. Consequently, the oil palm planting Program
for the project is as follows:

D. Oil Palm Establishment
Planting Material
5.07      The Mosa Plantation Pty would supply, under contract to the Govern-
ment, the settlement's oil palm seedling requirements.  This would be of a
dura x pisifera cross. The Mosa Plantation Pty obtains, and would continue
to obtain, its seed supplies from Harrisons and Crosfield estates in Malaysia.
At the time of the appraisal mission sufficient planting material was on site
to complete the 1968/69 planting program. No Droblems are envisaged in ob-
taining supplies to complete the planting program. Cover crop seed would
also have to be imported, and Malaysia would be the most suitable source.
Assurances have been obtained from the Government that suitable arrangements
would be made for the provision of the required quantities of planting material
and cover crop seed.
Fertilizers and Pesticides
5.08      In the absence of experience with oil palms in the project area,
detailed fertilizer requirements are not known. However, experience with
oil palms elsewhere, and with coconuts in the project area, indicates that
despite the high initial fertility of the soil, nitrogen, and possibly phos-
phorus and magnesium, may be needed to obtain high yields. In project costs
allowances are made for fertilizer use by settlers. It is anticipated
further that some Dynastid beetle and possibly bag worm attacks will occur.
Consequently, provision is made in project costs for suitable pesticides,
and application equipment.
Pollination
5.09      Pollination would be needed to obtain maximum yields in the first
four to six years of production, and would be provided as a central settlement
service. Suitable supplies of pollen can be obtained from Malaysia, and as-
surances have been obtained from the Government that satisfactory arrangements
would be made for the supply of nollen.
E. Palm Produce Processing
5.10      Settlers' ffb would be processed, and the products marketed, by
the Mosa Oil Mill Pty, which would be contracted by the Government to pro-
vide this service throughout the 25 year economic life of the settlers'
palms (para 7.02). Construction of the mill would start in 1969, and by
mid-1971 it will be operative with a capacity of 10 tons of ffb per hour.
By 1974 capacity would be increased to 15 tons per hour. This phasing of
capacity is adequate to process production of both the settlers and currently
planned plantings by the Mosa Plantation Pty. Without the settlers, a ca-
pacity of 5 tons per hour would have been sufficient by mid-1971, increasing



- 9 -
to 10 tons per hour by 1974. The basic design and foundations of the mill
allow its further expansion to a capacity capable of processing the produc-
tion from 16,000 acres of oil palms, equivalent to a capacity of 40 tons
per hour.
F. Cost Estimates
5.11      Total project costs, including capitalized interest on Pa-nua and
New Guinea Development Bank (PNGDB) loans made to settlers during develop-
ment, are estimated at A$3.0 million (US$3.3 million). The table below

5.12      The costs of extension services, smallholder labor, interest on
PNGDB loans and rent have been included in the above estimates only where
attributable to immature acreages. Only the costs of factory company serv-
ices over and above those required for processing and handling the Mosa
plantation crop have been included; these are investments in additional ma-
chinery and related items (para 5.10), in additional oil storage facilities
at the port (para 3.04), in additional tanker trucks for transporting palm
oil from the factory to the port, and in vehicles for smallholder ffb collec-
tion (para 6.11). The estimates are based on recent experience in the
Territory, or elsewhere by Harrisons and Crosfield, with adjustments made
and agreed between Government and IDA during appraisal.
5.13      The estimated import element of total investment expenditure is
57%, about A$1.7 million (US$1.9 million). Since most of the imports would
come from continental Australia and since the Territory's monetary and bank-
ing system is an integral part of the Australian system, the term "import
component" rather than "foreign exchange component" is used to describe funds
required for this purpose.
G. Proposed Financing
5.14      An IDA credit of US$1.5 million would be made to the Administration
of the Territory of Papua and New Guinea. The total project cost of A$3.0
million (US$3.3 million) would consequently be met as follows:
A$'000           us$'oOO         _X
Smallholders             20                22            1
Harrisons and
Crosfield             214               240            7
Government            1,418             1,588           47
IDA                   1,339             1,500           45
2,991             32350         100
The proposed IDA participation represents about 57% of the expenditures
expected to be incurred on the Droject after January 1, 1969, equivalent to
the estimated import component of those expenditures (para 5.13).
5.15      The Government's contribution of A$1.4 million (us$1.6 million)
would be used as follows: some A$696,000 (US$779,000) would be made avail-
able to the Papua and New Guinea Development Bank (PNGDB) in the form of
equity for on-lending to smallholders; some A$213,000 (US$239,000) - matching
the Harrisons and Crosfield contribution - would be made available to the
New Britain Oil Palm Development Ltd, also in the form of equity, for the
provision of processing and handling facilities (para 3.01); and the re-
maining A$509,000 (US$570,000) would be used directly by Government Derart-
ments concerned with project development, particularly the Deoartment of
Agriculture, Stock and Fisheries (DASF).



- 1L -
5.16      IDA's contribution of A$1.3 million (US$1.5 million) would be used
as follows: some A$593,000 (us$664,ooo) would be on-lent by the Government
to PNGDB for re-lending to smallholders; the remaining A$746,oo0 (Us$836,000)
would be retained by Government for use directly by Government Departments
concerned with project development. The Government would make this ust664,ooo
available to PNGDB at an interest rate of 1.25% to be repaid after 25 years
under the terms of a Subsidiary Loan Agreement satisfactory to IDA (para 6.10).
PNGDB is a new institution and is still in need of additional capital resources
(para 6.09), for which reasons Government appropriations to PNGDB have been,
and would continue to be for some years, in the form of equity. However, as
the Government's equity contributions have generally been made indirectly
from Australian grants-in-aid and as IDA funds carry a O.755 service charge
and have to be repaid starting in the 10th year, the proposed on-lending
terms are considered reasonable, particularly in view of the fact that all
PNGDB profits must, under the PNGDB Ordinance, be placed in its Reserve Fund.
5.17      The smallholders' contribution includes such labor as is not recom-
pensed by the living allowance paid as part of the PNGDB long-term loans
(para 6.05), and some cash contributions to capital costs made from early
palm produce revenues. The amount is small, but ultimately smallholders
would pay for all on-farm investment costs by loan repayments made out of
crop proceeds.
Procurement
5.18      The Government's regular tender Drocedures for purchase of goods
required for settlers (para 6.05) and for its own services are acceptable to
IDA and the amounts involved are too small to warrant procurement by formal
international competitive bidding. All Government services required under
the project - land subdivision, crop extraction road construction, agricul-
tural extension and social services - can be adequately carried out by
Government staff. Investment items under factory company services would be
procured by the Mosa Oil Mill Pty according to sound commercial and business
practices and, except for the processing equipment itself, are too small to
warrant formal international competitive bidding. The processing equipment
has already been ordered through direct negotiations with a reliable supplier,
which was selected on technical grounds without international competitive
bidding. The cost of this equipment attributable to the smallholder scheme
is, however, only 25% of the total, and no IDA funds would be disbursed
against it.
Disbursement
5.19      IDA participation cannot be related directly to the import com-
ponent and, since the factory company services form part of a larger whole
which is not being financed under the credit, disbursement from the Credit
Account would be made as an agreed percentage of certified expenditure on
only the following items:



- 12 -
(a) l00% of the direct cost to Government of land subdivision,
construction of crop extraction roads, and agricultural
extension services; and
(b) 80% of the amount of PNGDB loans to smallholders disbursed
for other than capitalized interest.
Disbursement of the proposed credit would then be approximately as follows:
1968/69     1969/70      1970/71     1971/72      Total
… - - - - - - - - - - - US$1000.
630         4oo          310         160        1,500
Thus disbursement should be completed by June 30, 1972, whereas investment
expenditures on the project would continue for a further four years (see
Annex 1). However, the total such expenditures in those four years
is only estimated to be some A$205,000 (US$230,000). A more detailed dis-
bursement schedule is given in Annex 2.
H. Accounts and Audit
5.20      PNGDB accounts would be audited by the Auditor General of the
Commonwealth of Australia, under the terms of the Papua and New Guinea De-
velopment Bank Ordinance, 1965.  Direct expenditures of the Government,
which would be kept as separate accounts to facilitate IDA disbursement,
also are audited by the Commonwealth's Auditor General. These arrangements
are satisfactory, but assurances have been obtained that audit arrangements
satisfactory to IDA would be employed at all times.
VI. SETTLEMENT PROCEDURES, ORGANIZATION AND MANAGEMENT
A. Settlement Policy
6.ol      The success of past and ongoing settlement schemes in the Territory
of Papua and New Guinea has been variable, but often poor. Major reasons for
poor performance have been recognized as being:
- expecting too much individual enterprise on the part of
settlers,
- providing advice and supervision through the normal dis-
trict agricultural extension service and not on a project
basis,
- failing to discipline settlers who breach credit and lease
commitments,



- 13 -
- failing to provide social services at the inception of
settlement, with the consequence that settlers have not
been prepared to bring their families to the site.
6.02      In the present project Government would employ a settlement policy
capable of overcoming the above constraints. Details of this policy as they
affect physical development have been given in Chapter V. Organizational and
managerial details are outlined below.
B. Settler Selection
6.03      Settlers are recruited by public invitation, sDecial efforts being
made in overponulated areas. Meetings are held to exolain the scheme fully,
and the Land Board, an agency responsible for recruiting settlers for land
development schemes, visits recruitment areas to interview applicants. Dis-
trict Commissioners and local DASF staff usually make some informal pre-
selection but, although the Land Board may consult them, it makes its own
independent recommendation to the Administrator. In making its recommenda-
tion, the Land Board considers the applicant's background, particularly in
farming and plantation work, his physical fitness and willingness to move,
and the availability of family labor to helD him. Before final acceptance,
names are checked with the Papua and New Guinea Development Bank to ensure
applicants have a clean credit record.  From 550 apolicants, 310 settlers have
already been chosen and settled under the first year's program.
C. Titles and Leases
6.o4      Ninety-nine year leases for holdings containing 15 acres of land
suitable for oil palm cultivation are issued to all settlers at the outset.
Key conditions of the lease are as follows:
- that eight acres of oil palms are planted in a "...good and
husbandlike manner..." within three years -- three in the
first, three in the second, two in the third year -- with at
least eight acres kept so planted and "....harvested regularly
in accordance with sound commercial practice....",
and
- that the lessee shall reside on the lease within six months
of the date of the commencement of the lease and shall con-
tinue to reside there for a minimum period of seven years.
The size of holding has been fixed to contain 15 acres of land suitable for
oil palm cultivation because it is expected that most smallholders, with the
assistance of their families, would wish and would be able eventually to
plant and manage 11 to 12 acres of oil palms, leaving the remainder of the



- 14 -
holding for food crops and houselot. The average annual rent paid to the
Government by the settlers is about A$9 per annum per holding for the first
10 years, after which the Government may review the situation.
D. Credit Arrangements
Loans to Settlers
6.05      Cash savings of most settlers selected for the scheme will be in-
significant. Consequently, the Papua and New Guinea Develooment Bank (PNGDB)
would provide loans to participating settlers covering up to 100% of the
costs incurred by each settler and his family, during a four year develop-
ment period, in moving to the project site, in establishing eight acres of
oil palms, in building a house and in purchasing household utensils 1/.
Pending establishment of a subsistence food garden, which takes about six
months, the loan would also cover food purchases. The PNGDB loan would be
disbursed in kind, except for a cash "living allowance" of A$8 per month per
family, and would be channelled through the project administration. Interest
would be capitalized during the first three years; in the fourth and fifth years
sufficient interest would be capitalized so as to leave the smallholder at all
times with a minimum cash income of A$8 per month. The loan agreement, which
each settler would enter into on being selected as a participant, would en-
title him to incur expenditure against his PNGDB loan account up to a total
of A$1,992 (USt2,230). The estimated make up of this maximum loan is shown
below.

1/  Settlers are brought to the project site by aircraft chartered by the
Government on their behalf. Settlers are only allowed to bring with
them a very small amount of household goods, so that they must purchase
new household utensils on arrival.



- 15 -
6.o6      As settlers arrive, project staff would prepare individual record
cards itemizing all goods and services used by each settler and the costs he
must repay. The costs of these goods and services would be met initially by
the Government. Subsequently, and on the basis of the record cards, PNGDB
would reimburse the Government, and debit individual settlers' loan accounts.
6.07      Settlers' loans would be repaid by deductions from the value of
deliveries of their ffb to the Mosa Oil Mill Pty (para 6.11); the latter
making such deductions as instructed by PNGDB. The amount deducted would
be 50% of the value of deliveries, subject to a minimum payment of A$8 per
month to each settler. On the basis of the yields and prices predicted in
paras 7.01, 7.03 and 7.04, this would allow full repayment of the average
settler's loan by the eleventh year after planting out his oil palms -- effec-
tively an eleven year loan with five years grace -- and would leave the settler
with a reasonable cash income at all times (para 7.06). Since settlers would
have no other market for their ffb, the method to be used for collecting loan
repayments should reduce bad debts to a minimum.
6.08      There would be adequate means of redress in the case of non-reDay-
ment of loans, or of unsatisfactory performance by individual settlers.
Firstly, PNGDB would make arrangements with the project administration for
suspending the issue of the living allowance to any settler whose performance
during the establishment period was below standard. Secondly, the standard
loan agreement between the settler and PNGDB provides remedies in case of
default both during the establishment period and thereafter. Finally, the
standard lease contains "good husbandry" and "residence" clauses (para 6.04).
The Papua and New Guinea Development Bank (PNGDB)
6.09      The Papua and New Guinea Development Bank, formed as a body cor-
porate by special Ordinance in 1965, began operations in July 1967. It is
financed by equity capital in the form of interest-free non-repayable capital
appropriations from the Territory budget (provided indirectly by the Aus-
tralian Government as grants-in-aid) and net profits will be added to a capital
reserve fund, available for further lending. PNGDB lending policy is based
on the ability of its borrowers to repay from profitable production generated
by investment, rather than the value of security. Lending periods, drawings
and repayments are matched to the productive activity being financed. Further
details of PNGDB are given in Annex 3.
6.10      PNGDB has loan procedures suitable for lending to particiDants in
the settlement project and has adequate legal powers to ensure the recovery
of its loans. As PNGDB is wholly owned by Government, and as the major part
of the project would be carried out by Government, all commitments in respect
of the project would be obtained directly through Government. However, a
condition of effectiveness for the IDA credit would be the conclusion of an
agreement between the Government and PNGDB satisfactory to IDA, providing for
relations between IDA and PNGDB equivalent to those that would normally be
provided by a Project Agreement. The agreement between the Government and



- 16 -
PNGDB would provide also for the on-lending of proceeds of the credit to
PNGDB (para 5.15) and to settlers according to policies and procedures sat-
isfactory to IDA. It would specifically provide:
- that the interest rate charged to settlers would not be less
than 6%, and that no increase beyond 6% would be made in this
rate without prior consultation with IDA, and
- that net funds arising from repayment of project loans would
be relent for agricultural development.
E. Harvesting and Collection of Settlers' FFB
6.11      Ffb would be harvested throughout the year, with peak month harvests
reaching 12.5% of the annual total. To keep the factory operating effici-
ently it will be necessary to coordinate fruit deliveries from the Mosa es-
tate and from settler smallholders. Thus settler ffb harvesting and collec-
tion would be organized on a project basis. Project staff would prepare an
overall harvesting and delivery schedule in consultation with the factory and
estate managements, and would be responsible for establishing and maintaining
suitable harvesting schedules with individual settlers (para 6.18). Since
the timing of harvesting is critical for the quantity and quality of oil ex-
tracted from ffb, project staff would arrange for the harvesting with hired
labor of holdings where, for a good reason such as ill health, the settler
is incapable of doing this himself. In such cases the costs of harvesting
would be deducted from the settlers' revenues. The Mosa Oil Mill Pty would
provide ffb collection vehicles, and settlers would be paid the value of
their ffb at roadside pick-up point (para 7.05).
F. ProJect Organization and Management
Development Phase: 1967/68 through 1971/72
6.12      Previous settlement schemes in Papua and New Guinea have been im-
plemented by the staff of the appropriate Government Departments concerned,
working in a largely uncoordinated manner. Such arrangements have proved
generally unsatisfactory.
6.13      The project is too small to warrant an autonomous settlement au-
thority, although otherwise this probably would be the most efficient means
of implementation. A system of organization which guarantees a high level of
coordination between the Departments concerned in settlement development has
been adopted by the Government as an alternative, shown in chart form in
Annex 4. This gives responsibility for the development of the project to a
Project Coordinator (Headquarters) in Port Moresby, reporting to the Assistant



- 1T -
Administrator (Economic Affairs). 1/ The Project Coordinator (HQ) has control
of all Government expenditure for the project, and allocates funds to the
various Departments concerned in settlement development for programs which
he has approved. Critical path methodology is being used to assist in con-
trolling project progress.
6.14      A Project Coordinator (Field), located at the project site, plays
a similar role to the Project Coordinator (HQ) but at the field level and
exclusively for this one project. Staff of the various Departments working
on the project site are responsible to him and, except for purely technical
matters, can communicate with their headquarters only through him.
6.15      A Project Manager is responsible, under the Project Coordinator
(Field), for the administration of the non-technical aspects of the project,
such as:
- pre-clearing,
- temporary accommodation of settlers on their arrival,
- distribution of supplies.
6.16      A Project Field Supervisor, who is a technical officer of the
Department of Agriculture, Stock and Fisheries (DASF), is responsible, under
the Project Coordinator (Field), for supervising agricultural development at
the settlement. Under him, an Agricultural Officer and an Assistant Agri-
cultural Officer would be allocated to each of the three settlement blocks,
assisted by about one Agricultural Assistant for each 40 settlers.
6.17      The settlement's transport and social infrastructure would be de-
veloped by the appropriate Departments -- Public Works, Public Health, Ed-
ucation and others -- in accordance with plans approved by the Project
Coordinator (HQ). Highest construction priority is being given to schools,
both because school buildings would be used as temporary accommodation for
the settlers, and because experience has shown that settlers will not send
for their families until satisfactory educational facilities are available.
Operational Phase: after 1972
6.18      With the onset of the operational phase, direct responsibility for
the various aspects of the project would revert to the Government Depart-
ments concerned. The two Project Coordinators would cease to operate, DASF
would run down its staff to the numbers required for a purely advisory
function, and by this time the services of the other Departments would be
operating on a routine basis. The Project Manager would be retained, how-
ever, his principal responsibilities being the coordination of ffb harvest-
ing and collection with the needs of the processing factory (para 6.11), and
the supply of on-farm inputs.
1/ The Project Coordinator (HQ) currently has other non-settlement duties
and may become responsible for additional settlement projects.



- 13 -
Group Working
6.19      While the powers of redress of PNGDB and the Government against
unsatisfactory settlers are adequate (para 6.08), the principal aim must be
to get the oil palms properly planted, maintained and harvested according
to schedule, so as to keep the processing factory well supplied with ffb.
The organizational arrangements described above would ensure satisfactory
administration and an intensive degree of supervision and would contribute
to that aim. Nevertheless, some settlers might fall behind, either through
illness or other causes. Assurances have therefore been obtained from the
Government that, in these cases, other arrangements for planting, main-
tenance and harvesting would be made so as to keep up with the project
timetable. These assurances could readily be fulfilled by arranging for any
such work needed on a settlement block to be done for the settler concerned
and by having his loan (or his successor's loan) debited accordingly. To
reduce the possibility of having to take action of this sort, the Govern-
ment proposes to arrange for group working and to allocate settlement blocks
so as to keep together, as far as possible, settlers coming from the same
tribes.
Role of the Mosa Plantation Pty
6.20      Apart from supplying oil palm seedlings for settlement planting
(para 5.07), Mosa Plantation Pty would have the major indirect role of demon-
strating, to settlers and DASF supervisors alike, efficient oil palm estab-
lishment and management techniques.
Staff
6.21      There would be no problems in obtaining sufficient trained staff
for the project. The posts of Project Coordinator (HQ), Project Cordinator
(Field), and Project Manager are already filled satisfactorily, and the
Project Field Supervisor will be appointed in the near future. All these
posts are filled by Australians, as are those of the three Agricultural Offi-
cers required. There is no shortage of indigenous Assistant Agricultural Offi-
cers and Agricultural Assistants, and the DASF training college at Vudal will
graduate indigenous Agricultural Officers some of whom may be available for
the project. In practice project staffing is likely to be more intensive than
stated above, since the settlement will be used for training indigenous staff
for future settlement projects.
VII. YIELDS, MARKETING AND SMALLHOLDERS' INCOMES
Yields
7.01      While growing conditions for oil palms at Mosa anpear very favor-
able (para 4.05), the yields used in report calculations are about 10% below
those obtained in Malaysia, as follows:



- 19 -
Year    4    5    6    7    8    9    10-20 1/

1/ Yield then decreases 5% per annum until the end of the palm's productive
life in Year 25.
Marketing
7.02      The Mosa Oil Mill Pty would process settlers' ffb, and market the
resulting palm oil and kernels, under an agreement to be concluded with the
Government, covering a minimum of 4,640 acres of palms for the period 1971
through 1996. This agreement would also provide that the price paid for
smallholder ffb would be determined by a formula, to be satisfactory to IDA,
which would take account of current world nrices, the costs of processing
and marketing, and a reasonable profit to the mill company. Such a formula
is not uncommon for contract processing and suggested provisions are outlined
in Annex 5. The signing of this agreement in a form satisfactory to IDA
would be a condition of effectiveness of the credit. In addition, assurances
have been obtained from the Government that alternative Drocessing and market-
ing facilities, satisfactory to IDA, would be provided in the event that the
Mosa Oil Mill Pty was unable to fulfil its obligations.
7.03      The Mosa Oil Mill Pty has already entered into a marketing agree-
ment with Harrisons and Crosfield, which company has extensive exDerience in
marketing oil palm produce, and no difficulty is expected in marketing
project production, which is a negligible proportion of the world trade in
these commodities.
Prices
7.04      Annex 6 examines market prosnects for palm oil and palm kernels on
the world market. It concludes that during the life of the project the cif
Europe price for palm oil will be in the range of US$155 to US$165 per metric
ton, and that for kernels in the range of US$134 to US$138. For the purposes
of this report the following prices are assumed for project palm produce ex-
ports: palm oil US$160 per long ton cif Europe; palm kernels US$136 -er long
ton cif Europe. These prices compare with the following average Eurooean
market prices for the first eleven months of 1968: palm oil US$170; palm kernels
US$155. Prices for palm oil in 1968 weakened sharply in the summer reaching
a low of US$141 per metric ton in June, reflecting exceptionally heavy supplies
of fish oil, sunflower seed oil and soybean oil. At the end of the year prices
were again hardening, but while expected to rise to the range forecast above
are not expected to rise to levels experienced earlier in 1968 and in pre-
vious years.



- 20 -
7.05      The increasing rate of extraction of palm oil and palm kernels
as smallholders' palms mature (para 7.01) will mean that the farm gate Drice
for the smallholders' ffb will rise from about A$10 per long ton in the
fourth year after slanting by about A$1 per long ton each year, levelling off
at about A014 per long ton in the eighth year after planting. The linkage
between these farm gate prices, the world prices for palm products forecast
in oara 7.04 and the extraction rates given in para 7.01, is shown in Annex
7, and takes into account the basic elements of the pricing formula given in
Annex 5.
7.o6      A cash flow for a typical smallholding is shown at Annex 8.  Dur-
ing establishment the cash income would be maintained at A$96 (US$lO8) Der
year by the living allowance loan (para 6.05). Over the following six years,
while loans are being repaid, the annual income would rise to about A$400
(us$450). At full production and after loans are fully paid, that is from
the 12th to the 25th years, income from the eight acres of oil palms should
exceed A$800 (US$900) per year. In addition, all settlers would be able to
grow food crops and many would be able to increase their oil palm area. Such
incomes, which may be compared with A$600 (US$700) per year from 15 acres of
coconuts or with a Dlantation worker's average earnings of A$400 (US$450),
nrovide adequate incentives to settlers.
VIII. BENEFITS AND JUSTIFICATION
8.01      The project would make land available to some 580 families, bring-
ing them into the cash economy and permitting earnings as shown in para 7.06.
It would open un a new area of fertile soils, provide a partial solution to
problems of population pressure in other parts of the Territory and,
importantly, would establish settlement techniques which would be applicable
elsewhere in the Territory and with other crops.
8.02      At maturity of their plantings, project participants would annually
produce some 8,200 tons of palm oil, and 1,400 tons of palm kernels. All
project production would be exported, and at maturity the foreign exchange
value of these exports would be about A$l.l million (US$1.2 million) annually.
8.03      The average net return to the economy of investment in the project
has been assumed to be that of the return on the whole oil palm development
scheme in New Britain, as described in Chapter III of this report. Insofar
as the major nart of the processing and port facilities would be recuired
for the development of the estate planting alone, this assumption is un-
favorable to the smallholder scheme taken in isolation. On this basis, and
charging as costs all Government services enjoyed by settlers, the return
would be approximately 9% per annum, assuming that the opportunity cost of
land and labor are negligible (see Annex 9).
8.o4      Since only relatively minor additions to the nrocessing and nort
facilities wqould be required for an exnansion of the present scheme, the
project, if successful, would have set the stage for a further project giv-
ing higher returns to the economy.

TX. CONCLUSIONS AND RECOMMENDATIONS
9.01      The project is well conceived, technically and economically sound,
and suitable for an IDA credit of US$1.5 million. During negotiations as-
surances have been obtained, inter alia, that:
(i)  adequate port loading facilities would be operative by mid-
1971, para 3.04;
(ii) in cases where smallholders fall behind in their programs for
planting, maintenance, or harvesting, other arrangements would
be made so as to keep up with the project timetable, para
6.19; and
(iii) alternative processing and marketing facilities, satisfactory
to IDA, would be provided in the event that the Mosa Oil Mill
Pty was unable to fulfil its obligations under the agreement
mentioned in para 9.02 (b) below, para 7.02.
9.02      The proposed credit would not become effective until the following
agreements had been signed, in a form satisfactory to IDA:
(a)  the Subsidiary Loan Agreement between Government and the
Papua and New Guinea Development Bank, para 6.10; and
(b)  the agreement between Government and the Mosa Oil Mill Pty
covering the purchase and processing of smallholder ffb and
the marketing of the processed products, para 7.02.

ANNEX 3
PAPUA AND NEW GUINEA
NEW BRITAIN EMLULHOLDER DEVELOPMENT PROJECT
Agricultural Credit and the Papua and New Guinea
Development Bank
A. CREDIT IN THE TERRITORY
The Commercial Banks
1.        The monetary and banking system of Papua and New Guinea is,
to all intents and purposes, part of Australia's and there is no
separate central bank. Following the normal British pattern, branches
of Australian commercial banks in the Territory receive funds on
current and deposit account and lend short-term, usually on over-
draft. They have provided some development finance to the agri-
cultural sector - but relatively short-term - usually for not more
than five years and generally on the security of rGal estate. The
commercial banks also make regular short-term loans, usually for
less than one year, on the security of harvested crops or cattle
ready for market. Current commercial bank interest rates vary be-
tween 5V and 71V..
2.        In the Government submission to IDA, it was suggested
that commercial banks might lend long-term in the private sector
and rediscount their loans with a Government bank. However,
Australian commercial banks do not customarily lend long-term,
nor do they refinance their loans by discounting, and (although asked)
they are unwilling to change their policy. The Commonwealth
Development Bank, financed by the Australian Government, has made
some longer-term loans in the private sector, but its lending in
the Territory is a very small and remote part of its overall opera-
tion, and it does not lend in the smallholder sector. The 1963
Bank Economic Survey Mission recognized the need for medium and
long-term credit and recommended organization of a financing insti-
tution suited to the specific conditions of the Territory.
Formation and Function of PNGDB
3.        The Papua and New Guinea Development Bank (PNGDB) was
formed in 1965 as a body corporate under an Ordinance passed
specially for the purpose.  It was officially opened for business
on July 6, 1967. PNGDB's purpose is to provide finance for primary
production (and for industry and commerce) which is "....not other-
wise available on reasonable and suitable terms and conditions.....
with "1 ..  . due regard to the stability and balanced development
of the Territory and the advancement of the indigenous popula-
tion .        ti






AT.'%EX 3

B.  CONTROL AND MANAG MENT
Board of Directors
4.        PNGDB is controlled by a Board of twelve comprising the
Managing Director, the Deputy Managing Director, the Territory Treasurer
and nirp other members, of whom not less than four are to be residents
of the Territory. The Board is appointed by the Governor-General of
Australia. The Managing Director and his Deputy may be appointed with-
out reference to other members of the Board. While this is a powerful
safeguard, introduced by the Australian Government to prevent mis-
direction of PNGDB, its effect upon PNGDB autonomy would need to be
considered when the Territoryls political status is changed. The
present Board includes an Australian industrial consultant, two long-
term Territory residents, the Chairman of the Xelbourne Stock  xcchange,
a local solicitor, the Secretary of the Federation of Cooperatives
(Papuan), a cocoa farmer (New Guinean), the Secretary of the Common-
wealth Department of Territories, and Sir John Crawford, Vice-Chan-
cellor of the Australian National University (and a consultant to
the World Bank).
Staff'
5.        PNGDB is staffed by competent and experienced senior bank-
ing personnel, mostly seconded from Australian commercial and develop-
ment banks. It has not yet recruited permanent technical agricultural
staff but has temporarily seconded personnel from the Territory
Department of Agriculture, Stock and Fisheries (DASF). PNGDB has
recruited suitable subordinate staff, both Australian and indigenous,
and foresees no difficulty in further recruitment.
C. FINANCING
Financing
6.        PNGDB is financed by equity capital in the form of interest-
free non-repayable capital appropriations from the Territory budget
(provided indirectly by the Australian Government as grants-in-aid)
and net profits must, under the PNGDB Ordinance, be added to a capi-
tal reserve fund, available for further lending. A$1 million were
so appropriated in 1966/67 and A$2.5 million are available for
1967/68. PNGDB does not immediately intend to exercise its borrowing
powers, except for the proceeds of the IDA credit which it will
borrow from Government, and the capital appropriations will continue
to be PNGDB's principal source of funds, at least until it is more
firmly established and profit earning, which may not be for two
or three more years. Additional funds required by PNGDB for project
lending would be provided by Government in this way and added to
PNGDB capital. Since, in its initial stages, PNGDB needs to build






ANNEX 3
Page 3
up reserves, and since any increase in PNGDB borrowing costs would
need to be financed by Government at least for a few more years,
Government proposes to on-lend IDA funds to PNqGDB at 1i½, the cost
to Government plus a small margin.  On repayment by its borrowers,
PNGDB would relend the IDA funds for further agricultural purposes.
To encourage PNGDB to build up reserves, however, and to make a review
of the use of IDA funds mandatory after a certain period, Government
proposes to seek PDNGDB repayment of its poriton of the IDA credit in
25 years. Net funds arising from repayment of project loans to PNGDB
would be relent by PNGDB for agricultural development.
D. LENDING POLICY
Lending Policy
7.        The lending policy of PNGDB is based on ability of borrowers
to repay from profitable production generated by investment rather
than the value of security. Loans are made long-term, may be drawn
by installments, and repayments are arranged to suit the particular
circumstances of the enterprise. Thus grace periods can be allowed,
during which interest only is pavable, with annual (or quarterly or
half-yearly) repayment installments expressed as a percentage of crop
proceeds; or a proportion of principal, or an equated annuity, in
all cases related to the generation of annual cash surpluses from
the productive resources financed. The present general RMGDB lending
rate is 6%, the rate currently charged by the Commonwealth Development
Bank. At the time of appraisal, negotiations were in progress for
PIIGDB to administer portfolios of loans made by Government at conces-
sional rates through the Native Loans Board and E2c-servicemenys Credit
Board. PNGDB would be protected against any loss of capital arising
from defaults in these portfolios.
E. PROJECT LOAN PROCEDURES
Applications
8.        Individuals selected by the Land Board to participate in the
settlement project would have the automatic right to borrow from
PNGDB, upon their acceptance of a loan agreement.
Disbursement
9.        For disbursement purposes, project staff would record for
each smallholder, and authenticate for PNGDB payment, the supply of
(a) building materials, tools and other goods purchased from local
suppliers, and (b) planting material, goods and services provided
by Government, including the monthly cash "living allowance". These
expenditures would be in accordance with a standard sample budget






.ANNEX
Page 4
attached to every smallholderts loan agreement and previously ap-
proved by PNGDB. The sample budget would indicate the maximum amount
which each smallholder would be entitled to borrow, and the loan
would be in the form of drawing rights up to this amount. PNGDB would
pay suppliers and the Government and debit the individual smallholder's
account. Disbursement would be in kind except for the "living allow-
ance".
Repayment
10.       The standard smallholder loan would be for eleven years, t,ith
five years' grace. Repayment would not be made by fixed ins6allments,
but by deduction of half the proceeds of the borrower's crop. Oil
palm smallholders would be bound by the loan agreement to deliver
their fruit to the Mosa Oil Hill Pty Ltd, the factory company in which
Government and Harrisons and Crosfield have an equal interest. Mosa
would enter into an agreement with PNGDB that it would deduct the
proceeds of each individual smallholder's crop and pay them to PNGDB.
F. LOAN SUPERVISION
11.       PNGDB staff would maintain supervision of loans for so long
as they remain outstanding. Although its staff would regularly visit
the project, PNGDB would rely upon the project management to alert it
when sriiallholders were falling behind in maintenance of their plots
or harvesting of their crops. It would, however, be for PNGDB to
take action against smallholders in default, which the loan agreement
empowers it to do, by dispossessing them and selling their plots as
a last resort.
G.  ACCOUNTS A.ND AUDIT
12.       Actual and five-year forecast balance sheets and profit and
loss accounts for PNGDB are attached as Tables 1 and 2. Audited
accounts were not available at the time of appraisal, since PNGDB
had not been in operation for a complete financial year. It is esti-
mated that PNGDB would make a small profit in 1970, and cover ac-
cumulated deficits by 1971, after making allowance for possible bad
debts and other provisions.
13.       The accounting procedures and controls set up by PNGDB are
satisfactory and PNGDB accounts are audited, at least once a year,
by the Auditor-General for the Commonwealth of Australia, who is
represented in the Territory. The Auditor-General has a special
section devoted to the auditing of the accounts and records of bank-
ing institutions.
H. CONCLUSION
14.       PNGDB has adequate legal powers and is subject to the close
scrutiny imposed by Australian banking law. It has established pro-
cedures suitable for lending under the project.

New Britain Smallholder Development Project
Smallholder FFB Purchase Price Formula
The basic principles to be followed by the Mosa Oil Mill Pty and
the Government to formulate the purchase price for fresh fruit bunch payable
by the Mosa Oil Mill Pty to the smallholders would be as follows:
(a)  Each calendar month, the Government would gazette a local fob
equivalent of the European main port cif price for palm oil
and palm kernels as of an agreed date in the preceding month,
less agreed freight, insurance, commissions, normal wastage and
overseas port rates.
(b)  An agreed deduction would be made for wharf handling charges and
for running the Mosa Oil Mill Pty's oil pumping and storage facili-
ties at the wharf to determine the "in-tank" value of palm oil and
the "in-store" value of palm kernels.
(c)  To cover the cost of financing bulk storage, a deduction of
three months' simple interest at 0.5% per annum over the Mosa Oil
Mill Pty's bankers' current lending rate on commercial advances
would be allowed on the said "in-tank" and "in-store" values of
oil and kernels.
(d)  An agreed deduction would be made for transportation of palm oil
and palm kernels from factory to wharf and for bulk handling,
bagging, handling and storage of palm kernels to determine
the factory tank value of palm oil and the factory store value
of naked palm kernels.
(e)  The ex-factory value of the derivatives of a ton of smallholders'
fresh fruit bunch would be derived from the factory tank value of
palm oil and the factory store value of naked palm kernels by:
(i)    first, deducting an agreed amount, per ton of palm oil and
per ton of naked palm kernels, in lieu of profit, deprecia-
tion and working capital charges and standard company tax;
(ii)   second, deducting any levies, cesses, export or other charges
or duties imposed by any taxing authority of the Government,
other than standard company tax; and then
(iii)  applying rates of extraction of oil and kernels from small-
holders' fresh fruit bunch, agreed on the basis of monthly
factory tests satisfactory to the Government.

(f)  The purchase price of fresh fruit bunch payable by the Mosa Oil
Mill Pty to the smallholders would be the ex-factory value of the
derivatives of a ton of smallholders' fresh fruit bunch less the
following agreed charges:
(i)   agreed factory operating costs,including management, but
excluding depreciation and working capital charges; and
(ii)  transport costs for collection and delivery to the factory
of smallholders' fruit.

MARKET PROSPECTS FOR PALM OIL AND PAL14 KERNALS
1.        A paper on the fats and oilssituation is currently under prepar-
ation within the Bank, and will deal in detail, inter alia, with the
market prospects for palm oil and palm kernels.   Progress on the paper
has reached the stage where it is possible to draw some conclusions about
palm oil and palm kernels, which are set out below; while these conclusions
must be considered tentative pending the publication of the more general
paper, no major changes are anticipated.
Palm Oil
2.        Trends in supply and demand for individual fats and oils are
far more difficult to judge than those for the total market, particularly
since most of the major oil products are produced either as joint products
or by-products.   Thus, as in the case for soybeans, the production of
specific oils may be determined, not only by trends in the oils and fats
market, but also by the demand for the joint or related products.
Another feature which also has to be ccnsidered in reviewing the market
for a particular oil product is the amount of substitution possible
between different fats and oils.   Within a broad range, on technical
considerations, one oil can be substituted for another.   Currently, the
bulk of palm oil is used in the food industry.   Here it meets its
strongest competition from soybean, groundnut and sunflower seed oils.
Fish oils are also used for edible purposes, but they are at a disadvantage
compared with palm oil, owing to the high processing costs involved in
making them usable for this purpose.
3.        Usually, the associated product of the marine and vegetable oils
is a protein-rich cake or meal.   The oil  palm, however, compared with
some of its competitors, produces a very low proportion of protein cake
to oil, and the cake is the by-product of palm kernel oil, rather than palm
oil.   The overall ratio of palm and palm kernel oils to cake is about 9:1.
In comparison, the soybean produces oil to meal in the ratio of 1:b in
terms of weight.
4.        Palm oil is produced almost entirely  in four developing countries:
Nigeria, Democratic Republic of the Congo, Indonesia and Malaysia.   Table 1
indicates the production situation in these and other countries in recent
years.   Compared with other major fats and oils (Table 2) the growth rate
for world palm oil production has been low, up to recent years amounting to






ANNEX 6
Page 2
only 1.3% per annum.   The only really significant expansion took place
in Malaysia.   However, in a number of countries, particularly Malaysia,
a considerable further expansion in production is planned for the future.
Some of these plans have already been put into operation.   If these
developments go according to schedule, total world production will amount
to approximately 2.5 million tons between 1975 and 1980.   This would
represent a growth rate of slightly more than 5% between 1965-67 and 1980,
compared with a yearly rate of increase of 1.3% between 195b-56 and 1965-67.
The share of palm oil production on total fats and oils production would
increase to approximately 5%, compared with 3% in 1965-67.
5.        Many of the developments are export-oriented and a considerable
share of the additional supplies will have to be absorbed by the inter-
national market.   Oil palm exports increased very slowly during the last
decade, largely owing to the slow growth in production rather than market-
ing  difficulties.   Actually, in the period fron 1954-56 to 1965-67, palm
oil exports declined slightly (Table 3).   It is estimated that by 1975
palm oil exports will amount to approximately 1.2 million tons, compared
with 550,000 tons in 1965-67.   Consequently, the share of palm oil exports
on total trade will probably increase to 9% in 1975, compared with 5.t%
in the earlier period.
6.        The palm oil economy thus faces two major problems in the future.
Firstly, it will have to face declining world market prices, a phenomenon
that is shared by nearly all major fats and oils.   Secondly, it will have
to increase its share as an ingredient in the total usage of fats and oils.
Considering the fact that palm oil does not have all the quality
characteristics enjoyed by some of the other oils (e.g. coconut oil), this
could only be achieved through price declines larger than those expected
for some other oils.
7.        It is in food uses where palm oil will have to increase its
market share.   In the past, this was only possible to a certain degree,
mainly because of limitation in availabilities.   Among other factors,
this apparently prevented processors from undertaking the necessary research
into the technical and economic difficulties which would have to be over-
come if palm oil is to be incorporated as a major ingredient in food pro-
ducts.   One major difficulty, particularly at the relatively high palm oil
prices of the past, appears to have been thedisposal at renunerative prices
of the inedible portion resulting from palm oil processing, which would
make large-scale processing feasible.
8.        The Chart (IBRD-L199) indicates that palm oil prices have
generally followed the trend of all fats and oils prices, declining to a
low level in 1962 and experiencing a sharp fall after the high 1965 prices.
Of particular importance is the narrowing of the large price difference
between soybean oil and palm oil which prevailed in the 1950's.   Since
1963, prices for both products have moved closely together, which indicates
that their future fortunes will also betightly knit.






ANNEX 6
Page 3
9.        Tn the second half of 1968, palm oil prices dropped sharply to
approximately $140 per ton, compared with $222 per ton in 1967.   This
steep decline was caused by large shipments of soybeans and soybean oil
and unusually large exports of sunflower seed and fish oil.   It is
believed that this is a short-term situation and that palmoil prices will
recover to a higher level.   In view of the large anticipated exports and
the technical difficulties mentioned previously, however, it is unlikely
that they will reach the 1967 levels.   Future prices have been estimated
to fall by the mid-1970's into a price range between $155-165 per m ton
c.i.f. Europe.
10.       These projections have to be seen in the light of the uncertain-
ties which surround any price forecast and of fats and oils in particular.
For example, if soybean exports under P.L. 480 are reduced or cease
altogether without compensating changes in U.S. production policy, the
above price forecast may prove to be optimistic.   On the other hand, if
only part of the large requirements that would be needed to meet the needs
of fat deficit countries could be turned into effective demand, the fore-
cast may be pessimistic.
Palm Kernels
11.       The fruits of the oil palm contain two separate sources of oil:
the fleshy and fibrous exocarp (pulp) from which palm oil is obtained and
a nut kernel in a hard shell from which palm kernel is extracted.   The
pulp of the fruits deteriorates rapidly after harvest and extraction has
to be carried out in producing areas.   Palm kernels, in contrast,
deteriorate very slowly.   Also, their processing into oils is a relatively
more complex operation.   Extraction is, therefore, usually performed in
large crushing mills, mainly in the importing industrialized countries.
Only in the Democratic Republic of the Congo have palm kernels been
crushed on a large scale and the country's exports consist almost entirely
of oil, rather than kernels.
12.       Wild palm fruits have a low proportion of pulp and a high pro-
portion of kernels.   In plantations now in the process of development,
however, the ratio of pulp to kernel is expected to increase.   Thus, the
future expansion in palm oil output will not be matched by a commensurate
increase in palm kernel oil output.
13.       Palm kernel oil, unlike palm oil, is a lauric oil and as such
closely resembles coconut oil.   These types of oils are regarded in many
countries as a desirable ingredient of margarine and shortening, and for
use in confectionary and bakery products.   Lauric oils also possess






ANNEX 6
Page h
special qualities which make them an essential constituent up to a certain
minimum in soap maufacture; they also have a wide variety of other
industrial uses, such as in the manufacture of synthetic detergents.
114.      All these factors account for a more inelastic demand greater
than for most other fats and oils.   This became very apparent in 1967-68
when prices of nearly all major fats and oils decreased.   Prices of lauric
oils, including palm kernel oil, remainied high, mostly because of short
supplies, but also because of the limited degreeof substitutability.
Presently, there are some indications that new industrial processes will
make it possible to produce synthetically the special component of the
lauric acid oils which are the cause of the inelastic demand.   This, of
course, would limit the special role these oils play in the market.   How-
ever, so far no definite information is available which indicates that
industrial manufacture of lauric oils will be undertaken on a large scale.
15.       The price, production and trade situation for palm kernels and
palm kernel oil are indicated in the Chart and Table 4.   It is assumed
that palm kernel oil, in line with other fats and oils, will follow a
downward trend in the future.   Since palm kernel oil will not increase in
output at the same rate as palm oil, however, it is unlikely that its price
will decline as much as has been projected for palm oil.   It is estimated
that a price range of $131-138 per m ton for palm kernels will prevail in
the mid-1970's.
