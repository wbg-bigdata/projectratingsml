                    Description of the Project
      The objective of the Project is to develop a sustainable and
replicable approach to soil stabilization and agricultural
development as a basis for improving incomes and living standards in
upland areas, specifically in Yogyakarta, but also in similar areas
throughout Java.
      The Project consists of the following parts, subject to such
modifications thereof as the Borrower and the Bank may agree upon
from time to time to achieve such objectives:
Part A:     Upland Productivity and Stabilization
1.    Improvement of microwatershed management of soil water
resources and conservation/productivity to stabilize soil conditions
in about 500 microwatersheds in about 80 upland hamlets, through
activities such as: group planning in construction of runoff control
structures; terrace rehabilitation; ground cover improvement; farm
planning; and development of nurseries.
2.    Establishing, and maintaining Upland Development Support Teams
(UDST) to provide overall support for Project participation, select
the microwatershed sites and conduct rapid rural appraisal of local
conditions.
3.    Development and testing of an improved slope stabilization
technology for the Project Area through an uplands watershed systems
action-research program, involving a multidisciplinary unit of
agricultural scientists and socioeconomists.
4.    Improving on-farm technology by carrying out extension
services and displays throughout the Project Area (approximately 30-
40 villages each year) conducted by subject matter programmers at
rural extension centers and subject matter specialists in Dinas
Pertanian (the district level food crops agency), allowing local
farmers to choose the elements of technology packages that suit
their specific farm conditions, financial and labor constraints.
5.    Provision of goods and technical assistance in support of the
above activities.
Part B:     Upland Community Development
1.    Increasing agricultural productivity as well as off-farm
earnings by:
      (a)   providing loans to assist individuals in about 1,400
hamlets in the Project Area to acquire seasonal inputs and develop
Page  9
alternative sources of income; and
      (b)   matching grants to about 140 villages in the Project
Area to support productive investment for farm and off-farm
activities.
2.    Training of, and support for: (a) rural development staff at
the district level and below in participatory planning techniques,
administering self-help credit schemes, and generating baseline data
on village-level socioeconomic conditions; and
      (b)   village and hamlet leaders in planning, executing and
monitoring village projects.
Part C:     Infrastructure Development
1.    Upgrading about 175 km of existing village roads and about 20
bridges.
2.    Improved maintenance on roads upgraded under Part C.1 above
and on about 365 km of roads constructed under the Yogyakarta Rural
Development Project, including improved monitoring.
3.    Strengthening: (a) through training, public works agency staff
at provincial and district (Kabupaten) levels to improve capacities
in areas including, selection of road and bridge projects,
construction of roads and monitoring construction and maintenance
activities;
      (b) the capacity of about 420 village leaders in labor-
intensive road construction methods by providing training; and
      (c) public works agency at district (Kabupaten) level through,
inter alia, provision of equipment, vehicles and office buildings.
Part D:     Institution Strengthening
      Strengthening, at the national, provincial and local levels,
the capacity to support and service upland communities and to
coordinate decentralized upland development programs, by providing
training, civil works, equipment, furniture, honoraria, support for
provision of land titles and technical assistance.

                   shown by said documents and other evidence to
                   have been paid out of the Special Account for
                   eligible expenditures.
      All such deposits shall be withdrawn by the Bank from the Loan
Account under the respective eligible Categories, and in the
respective equivalent amounts, as shall have been justified by said
documents and other evidence.
4.    For each payment made by the Borrower out of the Special
Account, the Borrower shall, at such time as the Bank shall
reasonably request, furnish to the Bank such documents and other
evidence showing that such payment was made exclusively for eligible
expenditures.
5.    Notwithstanding the provisions of paragraph 3 of this
Schedule, the Bank shall not be required to make further deposits
into the Special Account:
      (a)   if, at any time, the Bank shall have determined that all
further withdrawals should be made by the Borrower directly from the
Loan Account in accordance with the provisions of Article V of the
General Conditions and paragraph (a) of Section 2.02 of this
Agreement; or
      (b)   once the total unwithdrawn amount of the Loan allocated
to the eligible Categories, less the amount of any outstanding
special commitment entered into by the Bank pursuant to Section 5.02
of the General Conditions with respect to the Project, shall equal
the equivalent of twice the amount of the Authorized Allocation.
      Thereafter, withdrawal from the Loan Account of the remaining
unwithdrawn amount of the Loan allocated to the eligible Categories
shall follow such procedures as the Bank shall specify by notice to
the Borrower. Such further withdrawals shall be made only after and
to the extent that the Bank shall have been satisfied that all such
amounts remaining on deposit in the Special Account as of the date
of such notice will be utilized in making payments for eligible
Page  14
expenditures.
6.    (a)   If the Bank shall have determined at any time that any
payment out of the Special Account: (i) was made for an expenditure
or in an amount not eligible pursuant to paragraph 2 of this
Schedule; (ii) was not justified by the evidence furnished to the
Bank, the Borrower shall, promptly upon notice from the Bank: (A)
provide such additional evidence as the Bank may request; or (B)
deposit into the Special Account (or, if the Bank shall so request,
refund to the Bank) an amount equal to the amount of such payment or
the portion thereof not so eligible or justified. Unless the Bank
shall otherwise agree, no further deposit by the Bank into the
Special Account shall be made until the Borrower has provided such
evidence or made such deposit or refund, as the case may be.
      (b)   If the Bank shall have determined at any time that any
amount outstanding in the Special Account will not be required to
cover further payments for eligible expenditures, the Borrower
shall, promptly upon notice from the Bank, refund to the Bank such
outstanding amount.
      (c)   The Borrower may, upon notice to the Bank, refund to the
Bank all or any portion of the funds on deposit in the Special
Account.
      (d)   Refunds to the Bank made pursuant to paragraphs 6 (a),
(b) and (c) of this Schedule shall be credited to the Loan Account
for subsequent withdrawal or for cancellation in accordance with the
relevant provisions of this Agreement, including the General
Conditions.
