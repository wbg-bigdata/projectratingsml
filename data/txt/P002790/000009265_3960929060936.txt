MEMORANDUM AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT
OF THE INTERNATIONAL DEVELOPMENT ASSOCIATION
TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS
ON A PROPOSED CREDIT
TO THE UNITED REPUBLIC OF TANZANIA
FOR AN EDUCATION PLANNING AND REHABILITATION PROJECT
1.       The following memorandum and recommendation on a proposed
Development Credit to the United Republic of Tanzania for SDR 29.0 million
(US$38.3 million equivalent) is submitted for approval.  The Credit would
be on standard IDA terms with 40 years maturity. It would help finance an
education planning and rehabilitation project. The project would be
financed on a parallel basis by: (a) the Norwegian Agency for International
Development (NORAD) for US$4.9 million equivalent; and (b) the Swedish
International Development Authority (SIDA) for US$12.0 million equivalent.
2.       Background.  Tanzania's education system is seriously
deteriorated.   To correct this, the Government has committed itself in the
next phase (1990-1992) of its structural adjustment and economic recovery
program to undertaking major new steps to improve education as part of a
broader effort to strengthen human resource development.
3.       The deterioration of the sector has left a once exemplary system
on the brink of collapse. Primary school enrollment has plummeted from 96
percent in 1979 to 78 percent in 1987. Despite continued rapid population
growth, there were In. percent fewer children in primary schools in 1987
than eight years earlier. The quality of learning has eroded to the point
that students who complete the seven-year primary course are performing at
the level of fourth-year students in neighboring countries. Many school
leavers are illiterate and lack the basic mathematical and scientific
concepts needed to contribute to the economy productively. At the
secondary level, the numbers of schools and school places are extremely
limited, with the result that secondary enrollment is only 3 percent for
the 14 to 17 age group, which is among the lowest rates in the world,
second only to Rwanda. Because of inefficiencies in the production and
distribution system, textbooks are not reaching schools in adequate
quantites for effective learning, and those that do are of poor quality.
School buildings are badly dilapidated and maintenance systems are mostly
inoperative.
4.       The prospects for reversing this decline have in recent years
improved dramatically, as other, more positive changes have emerged. With
the launching of a new adjustment strategy in 1986, Government has been
dismantling the inappropriate economic and sectoral policies that
contributed to the extreme difficulties the country experienced up until
then.  Also, parents, concerned about the deficiencies in education and
bouyed by the rising incomes resulting from the economic reforms, have
displayed growing demand for better schooling and willingness to pay for
it. More than 50 privately financed secondary schools have been
established in the past five years, in rural as well as urban areas. The
private investment in these schools, including provision for recurrent
costs, exceeds Government spending for public secondary schools. As
communities and local authorities have moved to respond to parental demand,
a new mechanism for financing schools -- district education trust funds --



2
has sprung into existence and posted successes suggesting strong potential
for further expansion.
5.       To address the vast challenges it faces, the Government is
introducing appropriate policy changes at both the macro and sectoral
levels. At the macro level, the recovery program has achieved encouraging
progress thus far, reversing the decline in per capita income growth and
re-establishing a basis for sustainable development. To underscore the
increased emphasis to be given in 1990-1992 to the social sectors and
integration of the social dimension into the restructuring process, the
Government has changed the name of the recovery program to "Economic and
Social Action Program", and added a special component for a "Priority
Social Action Program" (PSAP).
6.       At the sectoral level, a strategy has been developed in
consultation with IDA and discussed in the PSAP. The Government recognizes
that remedying the extensive deficiencies in the education system will
require a massive rehabilitation and reform effort, demanding a long term
commitment to fundamental change, sustained over a decade and implemented
in phases. The first phase (the focus of this project) needs to
concentrate on (i) laying the groundwork for the entire reform process
through strengthening capacities and working out the details of the
measures required in subsequent phases; and (ii) addressing the most
immediate needs in the sector, concentrating on issues where it is clear
what needs to be done and where failure to act now would have particularly
serious adverse consequences in terms of human resource development and the
long term growth and development of the economy.
7.       Specifically, the priority issues for the first phase include
strengthening of: (a) institutional capacities, particularly in planning,
management, and implementation, (b) educational quality at all levels,
particularly in textbooks and curricula (especially science and
mathematics), and (c) mobilization and efficient utilization of resources
for education, particularly in regard to maintenance of schools and
equipment and use of non-government resources (e.g., contributions by local
communities, families, non-governmental organizations (NGO), the private
sector) to augment the limited resources that the central government is
able to put into the sector. To help facilitate the improvement process,
there is a need also for the two main ministries involved, Education (MOE)
and Local Government (MLG), to strengthen their collaboration within the
framework of increased decentralization of Government.
8.       Proceeding along the lines proposed here would build upon and
benefit from the activities supported by others, including the following.
SIDA has provided assistance in the promotion of basic education through
primary and adult literacy and post-literacy programs, the supply of paper
and production of primary textbooks, and is considering assistance in the
teaching of science in primary education. The ODA has supported a textbook
sector study in Tanzania. DANIDA is currently assisting the MOE to develop
a preventive maintenance program for secondary schools and colleges with
training, equipment and technical assistance support. UNICEF, after
working for some time to help the development of community schools, is now
directing its attention to the increased involvement of the education
system in child survival and development. NGOs have been actively involved



3
in promoting basic education, including the Aga Khan Foundation, the
Tanzania Episcopal Conference and the Christian Council of Tanzania. Other
aid agencies have participated in the development of vocational training --
UNDP, CIDA, SIDA, DANIDA, NORAD, the Swiss Government and the African
Development Fund. WHO and USAID have assisted in a school health education
pilot project.
9.       In addition, the proposed approach would build upon the experience
gained from IDA-supported projects in the sector. The previous seven
education projects suffered sustantial delays and implementation problems.
In some cases, delays were such that implementation occurred after the
objective to be met was no longer high on the Government's list of
priorities. Among the lessons that have emerged from an evaluation of the
seven projects are the need to: closely involve Tanzanians in project
design; define explicit procedures for actions to be carried out at the
decentralized level; and sustain a continuous and systematic policy
dialogue to ensure that project goals are in line with Government thinking
and that changes in Government structure or administrative mechanisms are
taken into account by project implementing staff. These and other lessons
have been incorporated into the design of this proposed operation.
10.      Project Objectives.  Within the context of this overall effort by
the Government to revitalize, reform, and rehabilitate the education
system, the project aims to: (a) strengthen the education sector's capacity
to plan and implement appropriate and effectivc education policies and
programs, (b) improve the quality of instruction at primary and secondary
levels, and (c) improve the mobilization and effective utilization of non-
government resources for the upgrading of educational facilities.
11.      Project Description.  The project will support: (a) an
institutional capacity strengthening component contributing to the
improvement of (i) training of education managers at central and local
levels, (ii) information collection and analysis in the MOE, (iii) capacity
for educational research and the use of the results to plan sectoral
im'rovements, and (iv) the preparation of studies necessary to assist
Government efforts to update the national educational strategy; (b) a
quality improvement component contributing to the upgrading of (i) the
Institute of Curriculum Development (ICD) which is the source and arbiter
of all teaching materials used in Tanzanian schools, (ii) the teaching of
science and mathematics at secondary schools, (iii) the production and
distribution of more appropriate textbooks for primary and secondary
schools, and (iv) libraries at the university, teacher training college,
secondary, and primary school; and (c) a component on strengthening the
mobilization and effective utilization of non-government resources that
will assist communities and local authorities to (i) upgrade the primary
school learning environment through better maintenance and rehabilitation
of dilapidated primary schools in under-served rural areas, and (ii) expand
and improve secondary schools through the use of district-level trust
funds, supported by the establishment of a national-level education trust
fund (NETF).
12.      A breakdown of costs and the financing plan are shown in Schedule
A. Amounts and methods of procurement and disbursement and the schedule of
disbursements are shown in Schedule B. A timetable of key project

processing events and the status of Bank Group Operations in Tanzania are
given in Schedules C and D. The map and the staff Appraisal Report No.
7998-TA. dated March 30, 1990, are also attached.
13.      Rationale for IDA Involvement.  The project is consistent with the
Government's priorities and strategy as set forth in its adjustment and
recovery program, including the PSAP, and the Policy Framework Paper, where
the need to improve social services is emphasized. Furthermore, IDA, as a
leading donor in the sector, is well placed to address critical sectoral
issues and to mobilize support of other donors within a common framework of
objectives and strategies for the coherent introduction of programs and
policy reforms. The new initiatives to be launched involve complex issues
on which the Government has limited experience and capacity, and thus
re-quires technical support.  IDA has considerable experience in these
areas, including lessons learned in Tanzania and other countries.
14.      Agreements:  The Government has agreed to: (a) introduce
immediately a competitive bidding process for textbook production and
distribution; (b) by June 30, 1991, (i) present to IDA a proposal for the
revision of teacher salaries, (ii) publicly announce that effective as of
that date, private marketing channels would be allowed to open and sell
textbooks, (iii) establish the NETF and appoint its Board, Secretariat and
Technical Unit, and (iv) finalize a comprehensive school maintenance
policy/strategy, providing for a gradual increase in recurrent allocations
for school maintenance, for introduction into the system starting in 1992;
(d) commencing in Fiscal Year 1991, allow schools to retain half the
increase in Government revenues resulting from measures to reduce the gap
in school fees between public and private schools, the retained funds to be
used for maintenance and/or needs based scholarships; (e) by December 31,
1991, furnish IDA a plan of action for establishing an appropriate
financing mechanism to ensure the provision of textbooks to primary
students after the project; (f) beginning January 1993, adopt nationally an
improved timetable for primary and secondary schools to optimize teaching
in the general academic subjects supported by project textbooks; and (g)
beginning January 1994, introduce the unified science syllabus in secondary
schools nationwide.
15.      Benefits.  The project is a major contribution to the Government's
PSAP. It would assist the Government initiate a process of rehabilitation
and reform of the education sector, with improved capacity to plan, manage
and finance the delivery of education services. Efficient systems for
improving the quality of science courses, and for producing and
distributing relevant textbooks, would be established. Approximately four
times the current number of students enjoying access to textbooks would be
served with suitable textbooks, and improved school facilities would be
made available to about 200,000 primary and 16,000 secondary students.
Graduates of primary and secondary schools would be better prepared to
perform, handle the basic mathematical and scientific concepts needed in
daily life, and join a modernizing and expanding labor market. In
addition, there would be an increase in the use of the private sector for
provision of educational services and the maintenance of its facilities.
This would in turn result in increased efficiency in the management of
schools and would encourage efficiency in the use of government resources.

16.      Risks.  There are two main risks.  First, the capacity
deficiencies of the implementing institutions might hamper the progress of
the project. This risk is being addressed through (a) a technical
assistance component designed to strengthen management capacity, and (b)
the proposed annual and mid-term reviews of project performance. The
second risk is that unanticipated changes in Governmental policies or the
political scene might affect the pace and direction of the reform and
revitalization of the sector. To mitigate this risk, extensive efforts
were made during preparation of the project to build a broad consensus
among Tanzanians involved in education, both within and outside the
Government, on the issues, priorities, and appropriate next steps.
Finally, the annual- and mid-term reviews of the project will provide the
forum and mechanisms for ensuring that the project can be adjusted to
changes in the economic and policy environment to meet the objectives of
the project.
17.      Recommendation.  I am satisfied that the proposed credit would
comply with the Articles of Agreement of the Association and recommend that
the Executive Directors approve the proposed credit.
