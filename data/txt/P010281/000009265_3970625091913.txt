MEMORANDUM OF THE PRESIDENT
OF THE INTERNATIONAL BANK FOR RECONSTRUCTION AND DEVELOPMENT
TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS
ON A PROPOSED LOAN TO THE STATE PETROLEUM REFINING
AND PETROCHEMICAL CORPORATION OF PAKISTAN (PERAC) FOR THE
REFINERY ENERGY CONSERVATION AND MODERNIZATION PROJECT
1.       The following report on a proposed loan for US$21.0 million is sub-
mitted for approval. The proposed loan would be made to the State Petroleum
Refining and Petrochemical Corporation (PERAC), with a maturity of 15 years,
including a 5-year grace period, at the standard variable interest rate, with
a guarantee from the Government of Pakistan (GOP). PERAC would relend US$19.2
million to the National Refinery Limited (NRL), which will bear the foreign
exchange risk. The loan would help finance a project to debottleneck NRL's
refinery installations and improve its energy efficiency. This loan
represents a continuation of the process of structural reforms started under
the recent Energy Sector Loan.
Background
2.       Pakistan has substantial natural gas and hydroelectric potential,
along with domestic reserves of oil and coal. iiowever, there are bottlenecks
in the development of power and coal supply, and limits to the utilization of
natural gas, as a result of which the economy must rely on imported petroleum
products to meet its energy requirements. Pakistan currently uses some
7.2 million tons per annum (tpa) of petroleum products, of which 5.1 million
tpa are produced by three domestic refineries, and the balance imported. Two
refineries located at Karachi in the south, the public sector NRL and the
private sector Pakistan Refinery Limited (PRL), refine imported crude and
limited quantities of domestic crude. The third refinery, the private sector
Attock Refinery Limited at Rawalpindi, was built to refine domestic crude from
the northern oilfields. The existing refinery configurations are outmoded,
resulting in a mix of products which does not match demand, and energy
consumption and process losses are high relative to refineries with more
modern systems. In 1985/86, Pakistan's gross imports consisted of 2.5 million
tons of refined products at a cost of about US$450 million. High speed diesel
and kerosene accounted for about 802 of product imports.
3.       Demand for petroleum products has grown from 4.2 million tpa in
1980/81 to 7.2 million tpa in 1985/86, a rate of over 10 per annum. Demand
is concentrated in the transport sector (50%), with another 40X being spread
about evenly between power generation, domestic, and industrial consumers.
The balance is made up of agriculture, government and service sector demand.
Demand for petroleum products in Pakistan is bound to continue to grow as the
process of urbanization and industrialization continues. Even though the pace
of growth in demand is expected to slow somewhat from its recent high levels,
there will be a continuing shortfall in the supply of petroleum products -
this shortfall is expected to increase to 5 million tpa by 1992/93. There is
a need to determine the most cost-effective means of supplying these deficits.
4.       The Pakistan refineries are old and of simple design, having been
built to minimize capital costs with little consideration to the high energy
consumption of the facilities. With the rapid acceleration of oil prices in



the 1970s, international oil companies in the developed countries added energy
conservation facilities and modified processing configurations of their
refineries as appropriate. Such measures were not implemented in Pakistan,
due in part to the ex-refinery pricing system, which guarantees a fixed rate
of return on paid-in capital, regardless of efficiency. The result has been
unbalanced configurations and a mix of product output not suited to current
and foreseeable demand patterns. In the short run, there is scope for
improving the output mix at the existing Karachi refineries to better match
demand, and to increase efficiency through relatively minor investments which
will reduce energy consumption. Some such improvements have already been made
at the NRL refinery, and further improvements will be supported under the
proposed project. A plan has been drawn up for efficiency improvements at the
PRL refinery, and these are expected to be implemented once the shareholders
have agreed on an investment program.
5.       In the longer run, Pakistan is faced with various options for
supplying its future petroLeum product requirements. The most basic choice is
whether to concentrate on creating the capacity to produce larger quantities
of deficit products domestically, or to rely on increased imports of refined
products. The total investment requirements in the sector are potentially
very large (of the order of $1.5 billion), while the costs, benefits, and
tradeoffs between various alternatives are complex and not immediately
clear. With this in mind the Bank has supported GOP in undertaking a
Petroleum Products Supply Options and Infrastructure Study (PPIS), under the
recent Energy Sector Loan (Loan no. 2552-PAK, 1985). The objective of the
PPIS was to examine the options and identify an optimum development strategy
for supplying petroleum products through the end of the century.
6.       The study has been completed by consultants and its recommendations,
including comments from the Bank, are with GOP for final review and
decision. The study recommends that immediate steps be taken to improve the
efficiency of existing refineries, and that in the medium-term secondary
conversion facilities should be added, although it cautions against the
construction of any new greenfield refineries. Under the Refinery Engineering
and Efficiency Improvement Project (Loan 2218-PAK, 1982), measures to de-
bottleneck refinery operations, increase efficiency and reduce energy
consumption at the National Refinery were identified. It is the
implementation of these measures which constitute the proposed project.
Further, the project would provide a vehicle for the Bank to pursue its
support for rational longer-term subsector investment planning and the
establishment of a suitable refinery pricing framework.
Project Objectives
7.       The proposed project is designed to enable NRL to:  improve its
refinery efficiency; reduce energy consumption; increase crude oil processing
capacity by debottlenecking existing systems, and modify the output mix to
better match demand; and strengthen production optimization and control
systems and train staff. In addition, the proposed project will support
sector-wide policy objectives: to promote a refinery pricing system that will
provide adequate incentives for efficiency improvements, as well as
investments by the private sector; and to assist the Government in formulating
an optimal investment strategy for the petroleum products subsector.

Project Description
8.       The project consists of six components:  (i) balancing and
modernization of the crude processing unit; (ii) addition of a captive power
plant; (iii) debottlenecking of the naphtha hydrotreater and platformer; (iv)
process modifications in the originaL lube refinery (Unit 1); (v) efficiency
improvements, including a process operations simulator; and (vi) studies,
training, technical assistance, research and development. The project prov-
ides for initial feasibility studies for items identified under the PPIS
(para. 10) which GOP may wish to implement, as well as possible future
subprojects to be undertaken at other PERAC subsidiaries to achieve the same
objectives as the main project - i.e., to improve efficiency or upgrade
output. These studies and subprojects would be undertaken by PERAC, and all
other project components will be executed by NRL. The project would be
implemented over about five years, starting in FY88. The total project cost
is estimated at US$51.0 million equivalent, with a foreign exchange component
of US$27.4 million (542). A breakdown of costs and the financing plan are
shown in Schedule A. Amounts and method of procurement and the disbursement
schedule are shown in Schedule B. A timetable of key project processing
events and the status of Bank Group operations in Pakistan are given in
Schedules C and D respectively. A map showing the project area is also
attached. The staff appraisal report (Report no. 6648-PAK) dated May 29, 1987
is being circulated separately.
Rationale For Bank Involvement
9.       The Energy Sector Loan (ESL, Loan 2552 -PAK of July 19, 1985) was
made in support of GOP's comprehensive long-term development strategy for the
energy sector, and hencr it was to serve as a basis for the Bank's lending for
specific energy investments over the next several years. The strategy, which
was formulated with assistance from the Bank, calls for policy actions and
institutional reforms needed to rationalize investments, mobilize resources
for the implementation of high priority projects, promote more efficient use
of energy through price and non-price measures, and to enhance planning and
project implementation capabilities of the institutions involved in the
sector. The proposed project will continue the Bank's support for this
strategy by improving efficiency at NRL, and addressing wider efficiency and
investment issues in the petroleum products subsector.
10.      The Bank's strategy in the petroleum products subsector to date has
been to encourage rationalization of the investment program, and to support
improvements in efficiency and the product output mix at existing
refineries. Under the previous Refinery Engineering and Efficiency
Improvement project, studies were undertaken to identify short term measures
to improve efficiency and reduce energy consumption at the existing
refineries; those measures related to NRL will be implemented under the
proposed project. In addition, this project will continue the Bank's support
for longer-term subsector investment pLanning, and the establishment of a
suitable pricing framework for refinery products. Under the ESL, the Bank
financed the Petroleum Products Supply Options and Infrastructure Study to
identify an optimal investment program for refineries and distribution
infrastructure. The proposed project will carry this process forward by
incorporating agreement on the framing of a core investment program for the
petroleum products sub-sector over the 7th Plan period (1989-93). Through



-4-
feasibility studies the project would also assist in the assessment of future
investment proposals.
Agreed Actions
11.      At the request of the Bank, GOP has established a working group on
refinery pricing, with representatives of the private refineries. During
negotiations, agreement was reached with GOP that it will (a) not later than
December 31, 1987, review with the Bank the report and recommendations of the
Working Group on refinery pricing; and (b) within three months oi this review,
prepare and review with the Bank the Government's proposed revised refinery
pricing system, including the plans for its implementation. Agreement was
also reached with CGP on the formulation, in consultation with the Bank, of a
core investment program for the petroleum products subsector for the 1989-93
period by March 31, 1988. This will be reviewed with the tank in draft form
by October 31, 1987. Further, the project will incorporate standard covenants
designed to promote financial discipline at NRL. The execution of a sub-
sidiary loan agreement, acceptable to the Bank, between PERAC and NRL, as well
as COP clearance of planning documents (PC-1) for the project, would be
conditions of loan effectiveness. WiL make use of foreign exchange risk cover
made available by GOP, such cover would be provided under arrangements
satisfactory to the Bank. However, since negotiations, the GOP has informed
the Bank that NRL and PERAC will bear the foreign exchange risk for their
respective portions of the loan.
Justification
12.      Quantifiable economic benefits under the proposed project are
expected from: (i) efficiency improvements that will reduce WRL's consumption
of fuel oil and electric power; and (ii) increased production of higher value
petroleum products, mostly diesel and kerosene. The economic rate of return
of the project is estimated at 42%, and the approximate annual net benefits
are expected to total about US$11 million by the time of project completion.
The establishment of a core investment program and an improved pricing formula
should encourage further efficiency improvements and investments in the longer
run, particularly by the private sector.
Project Risks
13.      The principal risk is a decrease in the international price margins
between crude oil and petroleum products, which would reduce the benefits of
refining crude oil versus importing refined products. However the project
economic rate of return calculations have been based conservatively on lower
than current margins, and the project would remain justified at margins sub-
stantially below those experienced over the past decade. The probability of
substantially lower margins over a prolonged period is considered minor as
worldwide refining capacity and demand is expected to be reLatively tightly
balanced during the project's life as a result of the recent closure of
several uneconomic and obsolete facilities, and consequently margins are
expected to be maintained. Apart from the price margins between crude oil and
petroleum products, there are no significant technical or market risks
connected with the project.

Recommendations
14.      I am satisfied that the proposed loan would comply with the Articles
of Agreement of the Bank and recommend that the Executive Directors approve
the proposed loan.
