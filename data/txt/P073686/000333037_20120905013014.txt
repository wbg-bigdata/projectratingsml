1. Project Context, Development Objective, and Design
 
1.1 Context at appraisal
1.      At the time of project appraisal, Nigeria’s institutions and governance had been
weakened by prolonged political instability. Sixty percent of its rural population (about 75
million) lived in extreme poverty. Natural resources other than oil served as the main source of
livelihoods for most rural people, but rural incomes and productivity had stagnated.

2.      At the same time, Nigeria’s natural resources suffered from overexploitation and
unsustainable land use practices. Weak management of protected areas, including buffer zones,
posed a serious threat to the maintenance of ecosystems and habitats as well as rural livelihoods.
The natural resource sector was also beset with deforestation, large-scale land clearing, and
floodplain encroachment, mainly because of efforts to expand agricultural production. Severe
land erosion was the result. The loss of valuable topsoil, significant siltation of water, and
flooding affected the sustainability of the Niger and Benue River systems, including the larger
ecosystems depending on those rivers. Soil losses reduced the productivity of the agricultural
resource base for rural communities, and floods destroyed fields and homes, leaving most of the
rural poor more vulnerable than before.

3.      Fadama ecosystems are found in Nigeria’s wetlands and along its major river systems,
including the Niger and Benue. These ecosystems support highly productive natural vegetation
as well as a diversity of resident and transient wildlife. They also serve as a source of water and
forage for livestock during the dry season. Despite their many advantages, Fadama ecosystems
are increasingly threatened by pressure from farming and fishing, owing to a number of factors:
      A clear policy on the conversion of and open access to Fadama resources is lacking. At
        the productive landscape level, coherent land use and land management plans are also
        lacking.
      Communities have little awareness of sustainability issues related to Fadama ecosystems,
        and extension advisors have weak capacity to provide relevant advice.
      At all levels of government, natural resource management policy and strategy are
        inadequately coordinated and integrated. Gaps in technical planning are seen at the state
        and local government levels.
      Limited human, technical, and financial resources are available to address sustainability
        issues in Fadama ecosystems.
      The understanding of the interdependence between land use and water management,
        both within and outside Fadama areas, is weak.

4.    To address these and other issues, the Federal Government of Nigeria developed a
medium-term plan aimed at achieving over five percent growth, mainly in the non-oil sector. The
plan was implemented through a National Economic Empowerment and Development Strategy
(now known as Nigeria Vision 2020), over 2004–09. Environment was one of the four key

dimensions of this strategy, which envisioned a large, strong, diversified, sustainable, and
competitive economy for Nigeria by 2020.1

5.       The Critical Ecosystem Management Project (CEMP) was closely linked to the
International Development Association (IDA) Fadama II Project (Credit 3838-UNI) approved on
December 16, 2003. It was intended to be fully blended and implemented simultaneously with
Fadama II project. However, due to GEF processing delays, the second Quality Enhancement
Review meeting of Fadama II project held on November 25, 2002 recommended the delinking of
CEMP from the Fadama II operation, and it was approved two years after the “parent? Fadama II
project. CEMP was fully mainstreamed into Fadama II to contribute directly to Fadama II
objectives and achieve incremental regional and global environmental benefits. For this reason,
CEMP’s areas of intervention and beneficiaries were the same as those of Fadama II. The same
institutional arrangements were used for the two projects. Finally, as in Fadama II, communities
expressed their needs through Local Development Plans (LDPs), The option for preparing a
stand-alone GEF operation, which focused on sustainable land management in Fadama areas,
would have led to significant inefficiencies (management, M&E, consultations, etc.). It would
have also over-burden Fadama communities with separate planning processes as well as missing
a major opportunity to integrate the issues of Fadama ecosystem health with those of community
livelihoods and well-being into a single development program. Therefore, the need to
mainstream the CEMP with Fadama II was glaring, and also meant that the stand-alone project
was rejected.

6.       The GEF support provided through CEMP was in the form of grant financing, using a
demand-driven approach for two types of alternative land use practices: (i) land use changes in
critical areas, such as riverbanks, flood-prone areas, groundwater recharge areas, and forest or
natural habitats of significant biodiversity value and (ii) sustainable agricultural practices in
Fadama areas added to IDA-supported LDPs. Specific sets of criteria were developed for
communities to access grant support for activities that promoted sustainable land and watershed
management (SLWM). Major activities supported under this component included: (i) Fadama
biodiversity conservation; (ii) alternative livelihoods in highly degraded critical Fadama areas;
(iii) energy-efficient use of solid fuels for watershed protection and carbon sequestration; (iv)
community woodlots on riverbanks and other degraded areas, and (v) sustainable indigenous
farming practices, such as reduced tillage methods, nutrient management, soil and water
conservation techniques, and efficient pasture and rangeland management.

7.      The project was aligned with the Bank’s Country Partnership Strategy (CPS), which
focused on poverty reduction. The CPS identified three priority areas for Bank support: good
governance, poverty reduction, and community empowerment and social inclusion. The CPS
fully supported the government’s strategy for rural development that rests on five pillars: (a)
increasing yields; (b) producing higher-value crops and livestock; (c) reducing agriculture
outputs losses; (d) strengthening linkages in the rural economy and incomes in rural non-farm
enterprises; and (e) reducing conflicts between various Fadama user groups. The Fadama II
project supported the government strategy by empowering local communities for their own

development by providing funds and facilitating support to help them utilize these funds in a
responsible manner. Thus, while Fadama II was aimed at poverty reduction, the GEF assistance
(CEMP) was instrumental in enabling the country to maintain the productivity and ecological
health of the Fadama resource base, with impact on the regional and global environment,
including enhanced capacity for managing Fadama resources within a river basin and watershed
planning context; and support for community investments in ecological services.

1.2 Original Project Development Objectives (PDOs) and Key Indicators

8.      The development objective of the project was to enhance the productivity of Fadama
areas and the livelihood systems they support through sustainable land use and water
management.2 To achieve this objective, the following key performance indicators were agreed
at appraisal:

             By the end of the project, sustainable watershed management coordination capacity is
              established in at least 60 percent of the participating states.
             By the end of the project, sustainable land and water management practices are
              mainstreamed in LDPs in at least 35 percent of the Fadama Community Associations.
             By the end of the project, the area under sustainable land and water management
              practices in the three pilot sites has increased by at least 80 percent.

1.3 Revised PDO (as approved by original approving authority) and Key Indicators, and
    reasons/justification

9.            There were no revisions to the PDO and the key indicators.

1.4 Main beneficiaries

10.      Fadama II, as a whole, is aimed at improving the incomes of about 2.3 million rural
households whose livelihoods depended directly or indirectly on Fadama resources in 18 of
Nigeria’s 36 states. The GEF intervention financed the incremental costs and targeted 20 percent
(about 400,000 beneficiaries3) in 6 of the 18 states covered by Fadama II. The project states (and
sites) include: Imo (Oguta Lake); Kebbi (Jega and Dimbegu); Kwara (Ajasse-Ipo); Kogi (Koton
Karfe); Ogun (Eriti); and Bauchi (Andiwa Lake). The project reached Fadama users, who were
the same as Fadama II beneficiaries in the project’s intervention areas, through Fadama

                                                            
2
  A slight discrepancy exists between the formulation of the PDO in the Financing Agreement and the Project
Appraisal Document (PAD). The PAD was specific in referring to the six participating states (Bauchi, Imo, Kebbi,
Kogi, Kwara, and Ogun); the Financing Agreement was not. The ICR team noted this discrepancy and used the PDO
formulation in the PAD as a reference. Project results therefore refer to achievements in the six states.
3
  The choice of the 6 participating states was based on a study: “Socio-Ecological Survey of Fadama Critical
Ecosystems? supported by GEF project preparation grant. The study showed Fadama areas experiencing land and
water degradation. The severity of the degradation informed the selection of the intervention sites in the selected
participating states.
 
 

                                                               3 
                                                                 
Community Associations (entities created by the project and registered as cooperatives), relevant
community groups, and NGOs to foster the adoption of sustainable land use and agricultural
management practices that would improve local livelihoods and the sustainability of Fadama
ecosystems at the watershed level.

1.5 Original components

11.     The project comprised four components: (i) capacity building, (ii) integrated ecosystem
management at the watershed level, (iii) community sustainable land management, and (iv)
project management and monitoring and evaluation (M&E).

Component 1: Capacity Building
(US$ 22.95 million, of which US$ 1.42 million financed by GEF)

12.     The objective of this component was to build capacity in sustainable land and watershed
management among groups of stakeholders in the six states covered by the project. Stakeholders
included relevant federal, state, and local governments; NGOs; community-based organizations;
and Fadama users. Stakeholders’ capacity would be strengthened through specific awareness-
raising programs, workshops, and technical training. Component 1 also aimed to improve the
policy and institutional framework related to Fadama ecosystems through a review of federal
policies and legislation on watershed management and an ecological assessment of GEF
interventions for watershed management at all levels of government in Nigeria. This component
also supported development of a framework for state-level coordination and M&E of watershed
management activities among key state agencies, such as environment, agriculture, forestry, and
natural resources.

Component 2: Integrated Ecosystem Management at the Watershed Level
(US$ 8.81 million, of which US$ 4.08 million financed by GEF)

13.     The objective of this component was to improve the management of critical watersheds
in pilot Fadama areas to ensure their sustainability and productivity. This objective was to be
achieved by implementing technical, social, and location-specific activities with high potential
for scaling up and replication. The component sought to: (i) strengthen watershed planning and
coordination mechanisms among state agencies; (ii) ensure sustainable management of forest
resources by developing community forest reserves in highly degraded and conflict-ridden
rainforest and savannah areas in Fadama ecosystems; (iii) develop a lake management plan for a
Ramsar site;4 (iv) conduct a study to understand the impact of upstream reservoir management
and river flow regime on Fadama areas; and (v) develop a monitoring plan to improve the
management of groundwater and shallow aquifers in selected Fadama areas.

Component 3: Community Sustainable Land Management
(US$ 14.05 million, of which US$ 3.96 million financed by GEF)

  A site designated as internationally important under the Convention on Wetlands, adopted in Ramsar, Iran, in
1971.

                                                               4 
                                                                 
14.     The objective of this component was to support a range of advisory services, training,
information sharing, awareness programs, and adoption of land use practices. Through Fadama
Community Associations, the component would support Fadama users to adopt sustainable land
use and agricultural practices to enhance the structural and functional integrity of Fadama
ecosystems and improve rural livelihoods. The component also aimed to finance two types of
demand-driven alternative land use practices: (i) land use changes in critical areas (such as
riverbanks, flood-prone areas, or groundwater recharge areas) and forest or natural habitats of
significant biodiversity value and (ii) sustainable agricultural practices in Fadama areas.

Component 4: Project Management and Monitoring and Evaluation (M&E)
(US$ 7.41 million, of which US$ 0.57 million financed by GEF)

15.     The objective of this component was to strengthen project management mechanisms,
including implementation of a sound M&E system. The component sought to strengthen the
effectiveness and quality of project operations at the federal level by establishing the National
Fadama Development Office as an integral part of the Projects Coordinating Unit (PCU) of the
Federal Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Development. The National Fadama Development
Office would include a GEF Desk run by a GEF project officer. The component would also
establish State Fadama Development Offices with environmental officers tasked with
coordinating the GEF program at the state, local government, and community levels. An M&E
system would be implemented to measure the project’s performance at all levels and would
include: (i) a Management Information System integrating efforts in the National Fadama
Development Office and State Fadama Development Offices with data generated by Fadama
Community Associations; (ii) impact evaluations and beneficiary assessments to enhance project
implementation; (iii) monitoring the project’s Environmental Management Plan, which included
mitigation measures related to agricultural production, processing, and marketing for
incorporation in LDPs; (iv) institutional capacity strengthening in environmental impact
assessment and integrated pest management; and (v) monitoring the performance of GEF
activities.

1.6 Revised components

16.    The components were not revised.

1.7 Other significant changes

17.     A level 2 restructuring on August 16, 2010 essentially reallocated funds among project
categories to meet two needs. The first was to empower members of State Watershed
Subcommittees (SWSs) in participating states to follow up and provide add-on activities that
could be implemented through subprojects. The second was to increase disbursement to ensure
speedy completion of groundwater studies and implement activities outlined in the M&E
manual. The reallocation provided additional resources in the amount of US$ 374,000 for
training/workshops and US$ 920,000 for incremental operating cost categories to execute
activities critical to successful implementation and completion. The initially low level of
resources allocated to these categories hampered the implementation of time-sensitive activities.

2. Key Factors Affecting Implementation and Outcomes
 
2.1 Project preparation, design, and quality at entry

18.     Preparation of the CEMP proceeded smoothly from identification to appraisal and board
approval. As noted, the project was mainstreamed into Fadama II, so its design benefited from
implementation arrangements for that project, especially arrangements for fiduciary processes
and M&E. To sharpen the focus of the GEF interventions, the preparation team designed the
project to include a Fadama GEF Desk Office, headed by a natural resource officer from the
Federal Ministry of Environment, to oversee and supervise the implementation of GEF
interventions at the national level. The team also designed CEMP to include subcommittees to
coordinate watershed management at the state level (the SWSs); and established the linkages
between the project and Fadama II through (i) the adoption of the same beneficiaries in the
intervention areas (see section 1.4); (ii) the use of the same local development plans to express
the needs of the communities; (iii) the use of the same local facilitators, and (iv) the use of the
same implementation agency as in Fadama II.  

19.     The preparation team adequately analyzed country and sector background information to
identify the key issues confronting the sector. More specifically, the team conducted a
comprehensive analysis of Fadama areas, which revealed that increasing pressure from farmers
and pastoralists was leading to land degradation, a major natural resource management concern.
In designing the CEMP, the team also incorporated lessons from the National Fadama
Development Project (Fadama I), the Local Empowerment and Environment Management
Project, and successful pro-poor interventions under the main Fadama II Project. The key lessons
were to: (i) empower communities with resources to improve their capacity to implement
subprojects; (ii) adopt a socially inclusive approach to LDPs, which were considered very
effective in managing community conflicts; and (iii) harmonize LDPs to standardize subproject
documents and technical designs. Innovatively, Fadama II had increased assets held by
beneficiary communities and enabled them to acquire and use additional income-generating
assets. This experience helped the team to develop and incorporate innovative alternative
livelihood activities into the CEMP to protect areas of critical ecological importance. The
activities included the adoption of sustainable agricultural practices that would increase the
incomes of Fadama users.

20.     Given that stakeholder consultation and involvement are critical to the success of
community-driven development projects, the team consistently ensured the involvement of all
stakeholders, including the beneficiary states, at each stage of project preparation. At the Federal
level, the team ensured strong collaboration with the relevant ministries, including the Federal
Ministry of Environment and Federal Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Development. Key
sector development partners, particularly the African Development Bank, also participated fully.
The team thoroughly assessed risks that could potentially hamper smooth implementation of the
project and instituted appropriate mitigation measures. Prominent risks were that Fadama users
would be unwilling to practice new, more sustainable approaches to Fadama land use (including
agriculture); insufficient capacity at the state level to pursue activities related to CEMP; and the
government's unwillingness to create coordinating mechanisms for integrated watershed
ecosystem management. The financial management assessment found that the arrangements

                                                 6 
                                                   
established under the main Fadama II Project would be satisfactory for CEMP, provided some
weaknesses such as inadequate record-keeping, weak internal controls, and inadequate internal
audit arrangements were corrected. However, the project design of CEMP included no specific
action plan about these weaknesses, since the accounting, reporting, and auditing arrangements
of CEMP resided in the financial management unit of the Fadama II project and in view of the
fact that it was agreed that these weaknesses would addressed by the Fadama II project before
effectiveness of CEMP.

21.     After successful negotiation in September 2005, the Board approved the project on April
11, 2006. The grant agreement was signed on April 26, 2006, and the project was declared
effective on July 26, 2006.

2.2 Implementation
22.    Project implementation started slowly, as reflected in the 32-month lag in disbursements
as of September 2009. The Panel for Quality Assessment of Lending Portfolio (FY09) rated
implementation progress as moderately satisfactory, in line with the September 2009
Implementation Status and Results (ISR) rating.5 Section 2.4 (fiduciary compliance) describes
the key factors responsible for sluggish disbursement. The panel still rated the achievement of
development objectives as likely, however.

23.     Implementation performance improved significantly during and after the Mid-term
Review (November 15–22, 2009). At mid-term, the project had made modest progress toward
the PDO. The project had established the SWSs, which were fully operational, and had
conducted awareness campaigns on integrated ecosystem management in the six participating
states. The SWSs provided technical input into the various awareness campaigns and
sensitization for Fadama Community Associations and Fadama User Groups to produce
development plans (LDPs). Also at mid-term, the project had completed three studies on
integrated ecosystem management and five of six key studies on sustainable management of
forest reserves in the participating states.

24.     The results and recommendations of some of the studies influenced project
implementation. This includes: the study of the sustainable landuse planning at watershed level,
which resulted in 100% of the FCAs adopting sustainable landuse planning practices in the
implementation of their LDPs; the study on improved groundwater management in the six
intervention sites recommended monitoring of groundwater in Fadama areas. To this end, in each
of the six intervention sites, three monitoring wells were installed and farmers were trained on
how to collect and interpret data from these wells and utilize them for Fadama activities; and the
recommendations of the study on the review of policies and regulations on watershed
management were implemented effectively, in particular that of defining roles and
responsibilities of institutions involved in watershed management. The report after the review of
the existing regulation and policies outlined a national watershed management policy and action
plan that takes into account the interrelationship between natural resources within a watershed.
The Federal Ministry of Environment is in the process of preparing a policy note on the action
plan.

                                                               7 
                                                                 
25.    The lack of logistical support for state environmental officers had affected regular
supervision. Except for Kwara State, none of the other states had vehicles to embark on effective
supervision, as vehicle purchases were considered off-project expenditures. The weak capacity
of personnel in M&E and financial management at the local government and community level
influenced project implementation. The Mid-term Review recommended actions to improve
implementation, including capacity-building activities in the three core areas: M&E, financial
management, and procurement. Project staff proactively implemented those recommendations
and implementation improved.

26.     Linkages and coordination between various institutions at the national, state, and local
levels were central to the success of the project. The Fadama GEF Desk Office, created at the
national level to augment project-specific institutions, provided additional impetus to implement
the project. At the state level, environmental officers in the State Fadama Coordination Office
were given additional responsibilities for day-to-day implementation of project activities. At the
community level, the Local Fadama Development Committee was responsible for developing
subproject proposals. The State Fadama Development Office reviewed the proposals to ensure
consistency with Fadama II objectives, and the Environmental Officers, with the SWSs, further
reviewed the proposals to ensure consistency with GEF objectives. These linkages and close
working relations among state institutions, facilitated by the SWSs, tremendously improved
project implementation.

27.      The participatory and socially inclusive approach used to develop LDPs positively
affected implementation. Fadama Community Associations and Fadama User Groups were
empowered to identify subprojects and prepare their LDPs in a participatory manner. The fully
functional Local Fadama Development Committees, which received, screened, and approved
proposals, ensured smooth implementation of project activities. Other factors that improved
implementation included: (i) the recruitment of an operations/GIS analyst, M&E officer, and an
accounts supervisor to support the Fadama GEF desk officer and (ii) the provision of equipment
(such as laptop computers, mapping and survey equipment, cameras, and GIS software) to staff
at all levels of project implementation.

2.3 Monitoring and evaluation design, implementation, and utilization

28.     The project used the M&E framework designed for Fadama II. At the national level, a
monitoring template that contained the output indicators was used to track data on a quarterly
basis. At the state level, the M&E officers of Fadama II were responsible for monitoring and
reporting data. A major M&E problem occurred prior to the Mid-term Review, however, when
qualitative updates of ongoing activities were substituted for reporting against quantitative
indicators, resulting in a moderately satisfactory rating for M&E in the September 2009 ISR. The
national M&E unit resolved the problem by organizing training for state M&E staff, and the
January 2010 ISR rated M&E as satisfactory.

29.     It emerged at mid-term that some state M&E officers focused more of their effort on the
Fadama II Project than on GEF interventions, which inhibited data collection and reporting on
those interventions. The national M&E unit therefore carried out intensive sensitization efforts

                                                8 
                                                  
for state M&E officers, in addition to developing and distributing a standardized monitoring
format for all state M&E officers. This action greatly improved the collection, reporting, and use
of CEMP data.

2.4 Safeguard and fiduciary compliance

Safeguards

30.     The project was classified as Category “B? and complied with all safeguard
requirements. The project triggered two safeguard policies: Environmental Assessment (OP
4.01) and Involuntary Resettlement (OP 4.12). Under the main Fadama II Project, an
Environmental and Social Management Framework, including environmental and social
checklists, was prepared, and this instrument was adopted for the CEMP. The checklist was used
to screen 958 subprojects across the six intervention sites. It is important to note that no
noticeable safeguard issues were identified during implementation, and none of the subprojects
or other project activities led to involuntary resettlement.

31.     The project developed, reviewed, and certified forest management plans in accordance
with World Bank standards for forest management. These plans were developed with full
participation of locally affected communities, consistent with the principles and criteria of
responsible forest management. Taking cognizance of lessons from implementing Fadama I, and
to guide against the recurrence of conflict between farmers and pastoralists, the project team
consulted extensively with community leaders and properly documented land acquisitions to
forestall future conflicts. To prevent duplication of effort and wastage of scarce resources, an
environmental safeguards audit was conducted under the ongoing Fadama III Project, which
covered the CEMP’s six intervention sites.

Fiduciary compliance

32.     The project complied fully with the Bank’s fiduciary policy and procedural requirements.
The project submitted regular Interim Financial Reports, and accounts were fully audited and up
to date. The project established an innovative direct transfer mechanism, which allowed funds to
be transferred directly to beneficiaries upon satisfactory completion of their respective LDPs.
This approach led to the successful implementation of subprojects in all six areas.

33.     Initially, project implementation was slowed because Fadama User Groups and Fadama
Community Associations had limited capacity to manage the grant proceeds and states did not
withdraw funds in a timely way from the imprest accounts into which funds were transferred on
a quarterly basis. Because the accounts could not be replenished until the states had withdrawn
the funds, disbursement was delayed considerably. At mid-term, a decision was made to stop
replenishing accounts of the affected states unless they submitted retirements of previous
accounts, acceptable to the national CEMP desk office, within 21 days following the end of the
quarter in which the advances were made. This measure, coupled with constant follow-ups by the
Bank’s Financial Management Unit, corrected this situation, and the project did not experience
undue disbursement delays thereafter.



                                                9 
                                                  
34.    At mid-term it also became clear that the accountant’s significant workload prevented
him from dealing with critical issues (such as the preparation of annual management receipts and
payment reports) and prevented the Fadama GEF Desk Office from obtaining information for
decision making. The Mid-term Review strongly recommended the appointment of an
accounting assistant to handle cash book preparation, analyze inflows and outflows of project
funds, maintain subsidiary ledgers, prepare payment vouchers, and maintain bank statement files.
This measure significantly improved the accounting and reporting of project funds and
disbursement. Other issues related to financial management were the use of a manual accounting
system, failure to maintain a cash book for special accounts, and the absence of bank
reconciliation statements. Upon recommendations from the Bank’s financial management team,
the PCU made a concerted effort to build capacity at the local level and improve the overall
financial management system, including computerization of the accounting system.

35.    The project initially encountered problems with the payment of counterpart funds.
Following intensive consultation with government, regular payments were subsequently received
from the main Fadama II Project.

36.     Procurement was judged satisfactory by the Bank’s procurement team, and no major
procurement issues arose during implementation. Most procurement was done at the federal
level. At the state level, the project adopted a community-based procurement approach for
subproject activities. The PCU staff of the main Fadama II Project could not cope with the
volume of procurement, however. The problem was resolved by hiring more staff, but some
studies were delayed initially by procurement delays.

2.5 Post-completion operation/next phase

37.     Under Fadama III, GEF financing was mobilized in an amount of US$ 6.8 million to
follow up on successful experiences and lessons from the CEMP. The aim of the financing is to:
(i) enable Fadama User Groups and Fadama Community Associations to identify and address
sustainable land management issues and (ii) support stakeholders and subnational governments
to better implement sustainable land management based on capacity development, knowledge,
investments, and monitoring of results. GEF support is also incorporated into technical options
for sustainable land management, including local land use planning, the community-driven
development framework, and the LDP tools. The newly approved Nigeria Erosion and
Watershed Management (NEWMAP), which was approved in the amount of US$ 500 million
also aims to addressed land degradation and in particular soil erosion in targeted sub-watersheds.
NEWMAP is blended with GEF financing (in an amount of US$ 3.96 million) and the Special
Climate Change Fund (SCCF) funds (in an amount of US$ 4.63 million). The GEF and SCCF
grants are intervening to support the development of replicable local and community innovations
on climate adaptation and soil, water, and biodiversity conservation that can be scaled up within
the broader project. The project will deliver global environmental public goods by enhancing
below and above ground biodiversity, reducing land degradation and terrestrial carbon
emissions.

3. Assessment of Outcomes
 
3.1 Relevance of objectives, design, and implementation

Rating: High

38.     The project’s objectives, design, and implementation were and continue to be entirely
relevant to, and consistent with, national policies and strategies, including global environment
priorities and the Bank’s CPS. The CPS outlines the Government of Nigeria’s seven strategic
priorities (critical infrastructure, the Niger Delta, food security, human capital, land tenure
changes and home ownership and wealth creation), in which land degradation is identified as a
major challenge confronting inhabitants of Fadama areas and the Niger Delta. The Economic
Transformation Blue Print (Vision 2020) underpins the government’s strategic priorities. It
specifically stipulates that the government’s key strategic objectives include: preventing the loss
of biodiversity, restoring already degraded areas, protecting ecologically sensitive sites,
harnessing and sustaining natural resource use, halting land degradation, rehabilitating degraded
areas, combating desertification, and mitigating the impacts of drought. The project had strategic
relevance because it complemented the larger IDA Fadama II project in six selected states (of the
18 covered by the Fadama II project) by adding sustainable land and watershed management-
related interventions such as shelter belts, orchards, community woodlots, and roadside tree
planting that contributed to the protection of the Fadama natural resource base.

39.     The project goals in terms of enhancing the productivity of Fadama areas and the
livelihood systems they support through sustainable land use and water management were clear
and appropriate concerning the priorities of the main Fadama II project. The design of the
components was also appropriate at that time as the project was intended to complement Fadama
II project through interventions in sustainable land and water management practices in Fadama
areas. The project approach is still relevant to the rural development strategy of Nigeria as
reflected in the design and implementation arrangements of the GEF-SLM project (The GEF
component of Fadama III project). The GEF-SLM project intends to improve the enabling
environment for scaling up sustainable land management in participating communities, thereby
building on the results recorded by the CEMP project. For these reasons, the overall relevance is
rated high.

3.2 Achievement of Project Development Objective

Rating: Satisfactory

40.    The CEMP greatly achieved its development objective. The project helped to establish
SWSs in the six participating states and enabled Fadama Community Associations to mainstream
sustainable land and water management practices into their LDPs with practical evidence of
enhanced productivity of their livelihoods. It also increased the area under sustainable land
management practices in three pilot sites: the Oguta Lake, Andiwa Lake, and Eriti Watersheds.

41.    Conservation strategies and sustainable farming practices adopted includes the use of
contour farming techniques to minimize soil erosion, establishment of woodlot for fire wood, use
of organic manure, establishment of vegetation buffer strips along the river banks, reduction in
                                                11 
                                                  
the use of fire during land preparation, elimination of obnoxious weeds, enlightenment
campaigns on negative impacts of bush fire, prohibition of the use of herbicides and pesticides
near farmlands etc. This effort led to the combined 43,568.55 ha of land put under sustainable
land management in the six intervention sites, and will assist in addressing land degradation,
desert encroachment and carbon sequestration. The 43,568.55 ha will remove about 2,904.57
tons of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere annually and help in combating desertification
(IIRR, 2005: Linking People to Policy, p.48). This is a significant improvement from the
baseline land degradation and environmental problems across the six intervention sites.

42.     The productivity of Fadama areas and the livelihood systems they support also increased
during the project period based on the adoption of SLM practices. For instance, trees planted in
project sites via community woodlots, shelter belts, road side tree planting, orchards and wind
breaks greatly reduced water and wind erosion, served as a carbon sink, stabilized soils, helped
stabilize riverbanks, enhanced the river filtering system, and performed other ecological
functions that reduced and reversed land degradation and improved the productivity of Fadama
areas. Most of the trees planted are economic trees, which not only generate economic returns
but are more likely to be maintained, thus ensuring future environmental protection and
sustainability and enhancing beneficiaries’ livelihoods. Over 60 participating communities
implemented alternative livelihood activities. The beneficiaries implemented about 10 different
alternative livelihood activities (e.g. apiary, grass cutter and rabbit rearing, fattening of
ruminants, snailry), which represented 438 sub-projects. The productivity of the high value crops
grown by the beneficiaries were tracked during the life of the project and the result is
summarized in Table 2.6). As indicated in the table, the yield of 18 cultivated crops in the
intervention sites increased significantly during the period, ranging from 0.61% to 275.52%. This
is due to the land management practices as well as additional land areas put under sustainable
land management practices. Tables 2.7 and 2.8 also showed the summary and disaggregation of
land areas put under sustainable land management in the six intervention sites.

43.     The achievement of the PDO was enhanced through the consistent focus on the three sub-
objectives of the CEMP interventions as aligned with the agreed key performance indicators of
the project. These are:

      (DO1) build capacity for sustainable Fadama natural resource management at
       national, state and local government levels: The project strengthened the capacity of
       stakeholders at the institutional and watershed level by equipping them with skills,
       knowledge, and expertise to effectively carry out their activities and by setting up a
       framework for watershed management. At the project’s inception, no watershed
       management framework was in place for Fadama Community Associations to adopt. By
       undertaking four studies (including a baseline study), developing training tool kits, and
       developing farming system models, a framework for watershed management was
       established to ensure the sustainability of development plans at the community level.
       Over 100 percent of the Fadama Community Associations adopted sustainable land use
       planning practices in the implementation of their LDPs. About 47 LDPs were produced
       and implemented. The project also supported completion of a review of watershed
       policies and regulations, and the recommendations were implemented effectively. The
       project also facilitated 98 quarterly meetings, with representatives from about 12 sectors,

                                               12 
                                                 
    for SWSs in the six states. All Fadama Community Associations were sensitized to
    watershed management approaches. Now, they can prepare and implement their
    respective frameworks for watershed management. The performance indicator aligned
    with DO1 was specified as “At least 60 percent of participating states with established
    sustainable watershed management coordination capacity?: This indicator was fully
    achieved. At baseline, the sector was beset with ineffective coordination among state
    agencies with mandates related to land and water management. The project succeeded in
    establishing SWSs in all the six participating states. Members of the SWS, in all the
    participating states, received the following trainings: (i) sustainable land use planning at
    watershed level, (ii) improving the sustainability of development planning at the
    community level, and (iii) integrated farming and sustainable agriculture at the Songhai
    farms in Benin. With improved capacity, the SWSs held about 98 meetings, and
    completed a study on the establishment of Watershed Planning and Coordination
    Capacity.

   (DO2) integrated ecosystem management in selected watersheds through sustainable
    management of key forest areas, buffer zones, and wetlands and improved water
    management: CEMP financed a range of advisory services, including training, capacity
    building, and awareness creation campaigns on watershed management that ensured the
    protection of critical watersheds and improved water management. All 958 subprojects
    included within LDPs featured better groundwater management by planting trees and
    pursuing related subprojects. To ensure effective data collection, a study on improved
    groundwater management and the impact of reservoir management was completed. The
    project also supported the identification of six community forest reserves compared with
    its target of three; all six have been beaconed and digitally mapped. The project identified
    and supported the management of more than 18,800.97 hectares of forest reserves in the
    six intervention sites, where about 15, 853.40 hectares of beneficiaries’ farm holdings
    have come under sustainable land management practices. The combined area under
    sustainable land management in the Andiwa Lake, Lake Oguta, and Eriti Watersheds rose
    from a baseline of 7,421.4 hectares to 11,635.23 hectares by the end of the project. The
    agreed performance indicator aligned with DO2 was stated as: “At least 35 percent of
    Fadama Community Associations with sustainable land and watershed management
    practices mainstreamed into their local development plans?: This indicator was fully
    achieved. At the project’s inception, less priority was given to sustainable land and
    watershed management, and only 2 percent of the Fadama II LDPs in the project’s
    intervention sites featured sustainable land management practices in the form of advisory
    services. By the end of the project, 100 percent (38) of the Fadama Community
    Associations in participating states had fully mainstreamed sustainable land and
    watershed management into their LDPs.

   (DO3) community sustainable land use management (demand driven approach) : The
    project supported community members, including those who did not belong to Fadama
    Community Associations, through community groups, NGOs, and Fadama Community
    Associations to develop local initiatives that enhance the structural and functional
    integrity of ecosystems, especially sustainable land use practices that improve rural
    livelihoods. At the CEMP’s inception, except for around 2 percent of subprojects for

                                            13 
                                              
       advisory services under the main Fadama II Project, no beneficiary communities had
       sustainable land management subprojects in their LDPs. The CEMP improved this
       situation tremendously, exceeding its target of 50 percent of Fadama Community
       Associations implementing alternative livelihood activities to achieve a remarkable 100
       percent. Beneficiaries in more than 60 participating communities implemented about 10
       alternative livelihood activities (such as apiaries, ruminant fattening, and grasscutter,
       rabbit, and snail production) through 438 subprojects. These activities generated ₦ 11.5
       million as income for beneficiaries. The project therefore greatly exceeded the target of
       preparing and implementing 60 percent of management plans for highly degraded areas:
       520 sub-projects were prepared to address water and land degradation issues. The
       performance indicator most closely aligned with DO3 was specified as: “At least an 80
       percent increase in the area under sustainable land management practices in the three
       pilot sites?: This indicator was fully achieved and exceeded. Through intensive
       sensitization, awareness creation, and capacity building, the project achieved an increase
       of about 87 percent in the pilot area under sustainable land management practices. In
       absolute terms, sustainable land management improved on 11,635.23 hectares,
       encompassing 651.58 hectares planted with trees for watershed protection, 1,347 hectares
       of forest reserve, and 6,424.4 hectares of direct beneficiaries’ land (plus 3,212.2 hectares
       belonging to others) placed under sustainable land management. The project supported
       the identification of six community forest reserves compared with its target of three forest
       reserves. These forest reserves have been beaconed and digitally mapped. The project
       identified and supported the management of over 18,800.97 ha of forest reserves in the
       six intervention sites; and, Beneficiaries’ farm holdings amounting to about15, 853.40ha
       are under SLM practices. As stated earlier, the project increased the combined area under
       SLM: Andiwa Lake, lake Oguta and Eriti watersheds, from a baseline figure of 7,421.4
       ha to 11,635.23 ha at end of project.

3.3 Efficiency

Rating: High
 
44.     Economic and financial analysis undertaken at the end of the project clearly documented
the efficiency of CEMP interventions. The analysis focused on four randomly selected
alternative livelihood subprojects: apiaries for honey production, teak woodlots for pole
production, establishment of a grasscutter farm with a startup size of two families, and rearing of
30 male and 10 female Belami sheep. Results of the analysis indicated that the CEMP
interventions were very cost efficient, with a total economic rate of return (ERR) of 212%, net
present value (NPV) of ₦ 5,367,020.42 and benefit cost ratio (BCR) of 8.43 (see annex 3 for a
detailed discussion of the analysis)

3.4 Justification of overall outcome rating
Rating: Satisfactory

45.    Taking into account the relevance of the PDO, project design and implementation, and
achievement of the PDO, the overall project outcome is rated satisfactory. This rating is justified,
given the overall achievement of key performance indicators, the cost-efficiency of project
interventions, the relevance of the design and focus of the project, by successfully adapting to an
                                                14 
                                                  
existing CDD project and approaches which were relevant to the rural development of the
country and the satisfactory disbursement performance resulting from good fiduciary
management throughout implementation. The Government of Nigeria’s interest in providing
support to scale up capacity-building interventions under the ongoing Fadama III Project also
justifies the satisfactory outcome rating.

3.5 Overarching themes, other outcomes, and impacts

Poverty impacts, gender aspects, and social development

46.     Impacts on incomes of beneficiaries: Project investments in alternative livelihood
interventions improved the incomes of beneficiaries (members of the Fadama Community
Associations and Fadama User Groups, which operate as cooperatives). Alternative livelihood
activities generated revenues totaling about ₦ 11.3 million (US$ 70,221) for over 7,688
beneficiary groups in all six intervention areas. States are required to monitor and report the
mobilization and use of revenues in their state progress reports, and they also provide guidance
to groups on how to use the revenues. Table 1 presents the breakdown of revenues generated by
beneficiaries in each participating state.

47.     Impact on deforestation and land degradation: The project’s support of alternative
livelihood activities (woodlots, orchards, grasscutter rearing, and apiaries) substantially reduced
bush burning and soil erosion. Some of these activities provided windbreaks, river bank
stabilization, shelter belts and new sources of organic matter for the soil. Beneficiaries in the
Eriti Watershed in Ogun State developed apiaries, which by the end of the project produced an
average of 1,440 liters of honey, valued at about ₦ 1.44 million. This revenue improved
beneficiaries’ overall economic well-being. Farmers in Eriti Watershed also reported that their
fruit-bearing trees, such as kola and cocoa, yielded more in 2009/10 than in the last 10 years
owing to the increased activity of honeybees in the area. The bees also prevented intruders from
entering beneficiaries’ forests for fear of being stung, this protected flora and fauna from being
harvested indiscriminately by unwanted gatherers. Finally, one of the key output of the study on
the sustainable management of the six community forest reserve, was the documentation of the
                                                        15 
                                                          
actual size and extent of these forest reserves, these were also beaconed and digitally mapped. A
significant output of this was the preparation of management plan for each of the six forest
reserves, and the formation and inauguration of forest management committees to implement the
plans.

48.    Impacts on gender6: Women benefited from project interventions. For example, in Ogun
State, 251 (46%) of 548 beneficiaries are females. Overall, 2,276 out of the 7,688(30%)
beneficiaries are female. This group of beneficiaries took the lead in alternative livelihood
support including marketing of the various agricultural products. Further, out of the 38 Fadama
Community Associations that participated in the project, 46 percent were female.

Institutional change/strengthening

49.    In support of government efforts to combat environmental degradation, the project helped
reform environmental institutions at the federal, state and community level. In particular, it:
     Strengthened the capacity of federal institutions: The Federal level agencies and
       ministries benefited from the following training workshops and seminars: (i) enhancing
       capacity in sustainable land-use planning at the watersheds level; (ii) development and
       utilization of monitoring format; (iii) review of policies and regulations at the Federal
       level on watershed management; and (iv) workshop on harmonization of LDP format for
       CEMP activities. The project also funded the participation of Federal and State
       government officials in two study tours: (i) project monitoring, evaluation and reporting
       in Accra, Ghana and (ii) integrated farming system in Porto Novo, Benin. Two trainings:
       (i) enhancing capacity in sustainable land-use planning at the watersheds level and (ii)
       harmonization of LDP format for CEMP activities were replicated at the FCA and FUG
       levels; as result, the beneficiaries are now applying sustainable land and water
       management practices in their farms, thereby increasing productivity and maintaining
       ecosystem integrity.

             Built capacity in state institutions: The project established SWSs and built their capacity
              in watershed management and coordination. Among the training workshops attended by
              the SWSs are the establishment of watershed planning and coordination capacity; and the
              strengthening the sustainability of local development planning at the community level.
              The project also strengthened the capacity of the State Fadama Coordinating Offices
              staffed with environmental officers to carry out the added responsibility of ensuring
              effective field monitoring and supervision of CEMP project activities. The environmental
              officers attended an international training course on community based integrated
              watershed management in the Philippines, a workshop on Geo-information and handling
              of field survey equipment, and a training seminar on the review and standardizing
              performance indicators format for CEMP.

             Built the capacity of community institutions: The project strengthened the capacity of
              Fadama Community Associations (which, as noted, were created by the project and

       registered as cooperatives) to perform their duties related to sustainable watershed
       management. Sensitization to sustainable watershed management issues and training in
       aspects of land management enabled Fadama Community Associations to manage and
       implement their alternative livelihood activities effectively. The project also created
       forest management committees in each of the six intervention areas and developed their
       capacity to make them more functional.

Other unintended outcomes and impacts (positive or negative)

50.    Not applicable.

3.6 Findings of the beneficiary assessment survey

51.      At the end of the project, a beneficiary assessment survey was conducted to evaluate the
project’s impacts on beneficiaries. The survey showed that beneficiaries were generally satisfied
with the support they received from the project, and more than 70% are ready to continue with
most sub projects after the closing of CEMP. Community forest, woodlots, Grass cutter farming,
Apiary and orchards ranked high in the response profile in terms of willingness to continue with
after the CEMP support. The assessment also revealed three key areas in which the project had a
significant impact on beneficiaries: (i) direct economic benefits to beneficiaries; (ii)
improvements in beneficiaries’ capacity to carry out sustainable land management activities; and
(iii) environmental benefits.

Direct economic benefits
52.     The survey showed that CEMP had a positive impact on beneficiaries. The estimation of
the total impact of the project on beneficiaries compared with those who did not participate
clearly revealed that the project had a large impact on the well-being of participants. Through
capacity-building interventions, the project enhanced beneficiaries’ knowledge of integrated
ecosystem management and sustainable land management. That knowledge enabled beneficiaries
to improve their livelihoods through larger yields and savings, good agricultural practices,
afforestation, and the provision of better sources of water, which enhanced productivity.

Improved capacity to undertake sustainable land management activities
53.     Through the capacity-building interventions, over 50 percent of the project’s
beneficiaries are now empowered, ready, and willing to continue implementing subprojects in
community afforestation, the rearing of grasscutters and snails, and woodlot and orchard
cultivation. The subprojects’ enhanced income potential (especially from grasscutters, snails,
bees, woodlots, and orchards), high productive capability, low technical requirements, and ease
of management are key reasons for beneficiaries’ high degree of enthusiasm.

Environmental benefits
54.      The project helped reduce soil erosion and prevent bush fires. 62.82% of beneficiaries
(farmers) confirmed that soil erosion was reduced because of the project. The beneficiaries
testified that bush burning was reduced significantly as a result of the project’s interventions. At

                                                17 
                                                  
the Kwara State intervention site (Ajasse-Ipo), the reduction of annual bush burning was 40%,
while at Eriti Watershed (Ogun State) is was 60%. This fact was supported in the beneficiary
assessment; as the Chi square test on the showed significant difference in the “Yes? responses,
implying that CEMP has made significant impact on CEMP beneficiaries as regards achieving
significant reduction in bush burning when compared to non-CEMP beneficiaries. There has also
been 100% reduction in the use of chemicals for fishing at the Ajasse-Ipo intervention site. These
achievements could be attributed to the intensive sensitization campaign mounted by the project,
that resulted in significant environmental benefits when compared with the non- intervention
areas of the participating States. Further, three ground water monitoring wells were installed in
each of the six participating States and equipment and training given to farmers to monitor and
interpret water levels for efficient ground water usage.


4. Assessment of Risk to Development Outcomes
Rating: Low

55.     The project’s risk to development outcome and sustainability is rated low, given the high
level of ownership and empowerment at both the state and community levels, including low
fiduciary risks, and low social and environmental safeguards risks. The assessment of the
following specific risks to development outcomes provides enough justification for the
sustainability of the project’s outcomes.

The institutional risk to development outcome is low
56.     Institutional development resulting from implementation of the project was significant.
The project supported capacity building and efforts to create awareness, particularly at the
community level. Through training and various capacity-building interventions, the project
strengthened the skills of Fadama User Groups in record-keeping, bookkeeping, and alternative
livelihood activities such as grasscutter faming, bee-keeping, and the planting of economic trees.
The project also established a sense of ownership among beneficiaries and empowered them to
take control of their own affairs, which will ensure that development outcomes are sustained.
Similarly, the trainings received by the Federal and State level agencies to strengthen their skills
in sustainable land-use planning at the watershed level, monitoring and evaluation, watershed
policies and regulations reviews, and development and synchronization of LDP format for
CEMP activities would evidently sustain development outcomes.

The economic and financial risk to development outcome is moderate
57.     At project preparation, the financial management risks identified includes funds diversion
and misuse, collusion with service providers and cost escalation. These risks were appropriately
mitigated by the project team. In particular, the risks were mitigated by making use of the
financial mechanisms and expertise developed in the Fadama II Project (which was responsible
for Financial Management of CEMP). The financial management risks were mitigated through
regular auditing, FM supervision missions and establishment of Project Financial Management
Units in the participating states. At the state and community levels during implementation, the
project provided training in grant management, which improved beneficiaries’ understanding of
basic principles of bookkeeping and thus their capacity to generate revenue. To mitigate financial

                                                18 
                                                  
risks at the community levels, matching grants were released to the beneficiary groups in
tranches, and the setting up of internal audit unit within the PIUs and by extension covering the
activities of the FCAs/FUGs helped in mitigating financial risk by auditing the activities of the
FCAs/FUGs. Efforts were also made to ensure full disclosure by insistence on record keeping by
FUGs and FCAs; and public display of information on projects including expenditure and project
funds received. The FCAs and FUGs also agreed on Operation and Maintenance arrangements,
whereby 5% of subproject cost were kept aside for O&M for the investments supported under
the project.

The environmental risks to development outcome are low
58.     At appraisal, the project team carried out an environmental and social assessment and
categorized the project as a Category B project. The fact that most project activities were
environmentally friendly should make it possible to sustain the development outcomes. No
safeguard issues surfaced in relation to involuntary resettlement and land acquisition problems in
the intervention areas.
The social risk to development outcomes is low
59.     The project enhanced the livelihoods and living standards of beneficiaries, thereby
contributing to the government’s poverty reduction agenda (as stated in its vision 2020 blue
print) and to the Millennium Development Goals. The project’s development outcomes should
also be sustained through the social institutions created among beneficiaries (Fadama
Community Associations and Fadama User Groups) and through the government’s commitment
to continue co-financing key activities through the Fadama III Project. Finally, the risk of
farmers going back to their original practices is low, given the enhanced income potential of the

5. Assessment of Bank and Borrower Performance
 
5.1 Bank performance counterpart funding

Bank Performance in ensuring quality at entry
Rating: Satisfactory

60.     The Bank’s performance during project identification, preparation, and appraisal is rated
satisfactory. The Bank built a strong team with diverse expertise and provided the requisite
leadership. Bank staff worked closely with the government team and guided the preparation
process to ensure adherence to key operational policies and procedures. Major sections of the
project document, particularly the M&E framework, were strengthened. A quality assessment of
the lending portfolio in FY09 emphasized key design features that would ensure the project’s
success, especially the design of the results framework, which panel members found realistic in
selecting indicators that could be measured within the project’s timeframe. The Bank also
maintained effective communication with the government, which significantly improved quality
at entry, as the government was very responsive in providing the need support.

Quality of supervision

                                               19 
                                                 
Rating: Satisfactory

61.     Bank performance with regard to supervision is rated satisfactory. The Bank organized
eight joint supervision missions, including the Mid-term Review. During such missions, the
Bank team worked closely with project staff to address key implementation issues and make
recommendations to resolve them. The Bank also maintained strong working relations with the
project staff and was very effective in reviewing and clearing documents, including providing
no-objections from the project staff. The task team leader was very available to project staff
when issues arose, even outside mission periods.

62.    To improve implementation, the Bank organized a quality assessment review conducted
by the Quality Assessment Group in FY09. The review responded to an earlier implementation
progress rating of moderately satisfactory, arising from initial fiduciary problems (in financial
management and procurement) and M&E problems encountered by the project. The quality
assessment found that the Bank provided good advice and solutions to problems but
recommended that subsequent supervision missions should aggressively address the weaknesses
in the fiduciary system that had inhibited implementation. The Bank team and project staff
implemented the recommendations of the panel, and implementation performance improved
remarkably, particularly after the Mid-term Review.

Overall performance
Rating: Satisfactory

63.    Taking into account the quality of project preparation and supervision, the Bank’s overall
performance is rated satisfactory. The Bank ensured quality in the project design and a clearly
focused development objective. It made substantive contributions to address major
implementation issues that arose during supervision missions. Finally, the Bank implemented the
recommendations of the Quality Assessment of Lending Portfolio–2, which improved
implementation performance.

5.2 Borrower performance

Government performance
Rating: Satisfactory

64.     Government performance is rated satisfactory. The Government of Nigeria showed a high
level of commitment: It facilitated the preparation process, put in place dedicated officers to staff
the core PCU, and met all of the effectiveness conditions. Synergy between the Federal Ministry
of Agriculture and Rural Development and the Federal Ministry of Environment was a key factor
in the project’s successful implementation. The Federal Ministry of Environment seconded a
highly qualified staff, with considerable expertise in forest management, to head the Fadama
GEF Desk Office and work specifically on the implementation of GEF interventions in close
collaboration with the entire project staff.

65.     Despite the initial challenges in the release of counterpart funds, the government met its
entire counterpart fund requirement through the main Fadama II Project. After resolving initial
difficulties, the government made regular and timely payments of counterpart funds. To show

                                                 20 
                                                   
commitment the beneficiaries Local Government Authorities willingly contributed a matching
grant of N 1 million attesting to high level of commitment at the lowest level of government.

Implementation Agency or Agencies Performance
Rating: Satisfactory

66.     The implementation agency’s performance is rated satisfactory. As noted, the CEMP
utilized the implementation structures and Project Management Unit (PMU) of the main Fadama
II Project, integrated in the Federal Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Development. The Project
Management Unit served as the lead project implementation agency, facilitated all preparatory
missions from identification to appraisal, and worked in harmony with the Bank team to ensure
quality of key project documents.

67.     The PMU also ensured smooth implementation of day-to-day activities, discussing and
resolving key implementation issues with the Bank team. The PMU complied fully with the
Bank’s reporting procedures, especially in the areas of procurement and financial management.
The financial management team of successive Bank missions rated the financial management
system operated by the PMU as satisfactory. The effects of this level of financial management on
disbursement were positive: As of November 30, 2011 (financial management reporting period),
the project had disbursed 99.99 percent of its funds.

Justification for Rating Overall Borrower Performance
Rating: Satisfactory

68.    The borrower’s overall performance is rated satisfactory. The borrower exhibited the
optimum level of commitment to the project’s development objectives, as manifested in the
ongoing Fadama III Project, for which GEF interventions (capacity-building activities) are being
implemented at the state and community levels. During the implementation of the CEMP, the
borrower complied fully with all bank policies and procedures, including legal covenants and
financial management and procurement rules and regulations, and it submitted audit reports to
the Bank on time.

6. Lessons Learned

69.       The key lessons drawn from project implementation are:

         Community participation, ownership, and empowerment are key to the success of
          community-driven development projects such as the CEMP. The CEMP ensured that
          communities were fully in charge of fiscal and investment decisions with respect to the
          implementation of subprojects. The direct transfer of funds to the Fadama Community
          Associations and Fadama User Groups, as well as the capacity-building programs
          organized for them, enhanced their ability to prepare and implement projects and instilled
          a real sense of ownership and empowerment. Empowering the communities also
          improved local monitoring, data collection, coordination, and supervision.

         Sustainable livelihood interventions, with significant advocacy and awareness

                                                  21 
                                                    
        programs, have proven very effective in ensuring environmental sustainability.
        Natural resource management interventions have no benefits and impacts if they are not
        linked to income-generating activities that improve the living standards of the
        beneficiaries. The CEMP empowered communities to take the development of their own
        environment into their own hands by planting and cultivating economic (cash) crops.
        Through this approach, the communities attached greater importance to the development
        and sustainability of their own environments.

       Mainstreaming a community-driven development project into another community-
        driven development project requires a detailed assessment of existing
        implementation arrangements and their capacity to cope with the anticipated
        workload of the two projects. As noted, the CEMP was integrated into the Fadama II
        Project and used its fiduciary and M&E systems, but the volume of work relative to
        available staff meant that the staff could not cope with the workload. Financial
        management, procurement, and M&E activities were delayed. Future projects should
        incorporate specific measures and actions to mitigate problems that would arise from
        such arrangements.

       Ensuring effective supervision and monitoring is the key to successful community-
        driven development projects. The project design envisaged regular supervision of
        subprojects by state staff, but the lack of sufficient logistical support somewhat
        constrained smooth supervision of subprojects in most states. Future operations of this
        nature should include the procurement of logistics to support supervision.

    7. Comments and Issues by Borrower/Implementation/Partners
 
70.    The Government of Nigeria had no specific comments on the draft ICR. They corrected
some acronyms and some editing mistakes, and wished that the overall project would be declared
Highly Satisfactory because of the impacts in the six CEMP participating states. The borrower’s
ICR is summarized in Annex 7.

  The 275% of appraisal estimate for project management and M&E costs was based on the reallocation of funds
during the re-structuring of the project. The restructuring was based on the findings and recommendations of various
implementation support missions and the MTR. This increase results from: (i) purchase of two additional 4-WD pick
up vehicles for sub project monitoring and supervision at the NFCO and Kwara State; (ii) stepping up of routine
M&E and implementation support by both NFCO and the six SFCOs to FCAs and FUGs; (iii) Increase funding for
SWS activities; and (iv) Purchase of 15 GPS, 6 photocopiers, 5 desktop computers, 6 multi-media projectors, 7
public address systems and production of digital maps

Annex 2. Outputs by Component
Component 1: Capacity Building
71.     Component 1 built the capacity of Fadama users and other key stakeholders, including
relevant federal, state and local governments, NGOs, and community-based organizations, in the
six targeted states (Bauchi, Imo, Kebbi, Kogi, Kwara, and Ogun) for sustainable land and
watershed management. The achievements of this component are rated satisfactory. Key
intermediate performance indicators and their targets are shown in table 2.1.

Table 2.1: Key Intermediate Performance and Output Indicators for Component 1

                                                                                        Achieved
1.    By end of year 1, a framework for watershed management          0         1           1
      is prepared.
2.    By end of project, sustainable land use planning practices     0%        50%        100%
      are adopted by at least 50% of Fadama Community
      Association members implementing LDPs in GEF co-
      financed project areas.


72.     This component strengthened the capacity of stakeholders at the institutional and
watershed level by equipping them with skills, knowledge, and expertise to effectively carry out
their activities and by setting up a framework for watershed management. At the project’s
inception, no watershed management framework was in place for Fadama Community
Associations to adopt. By undertaking four studies (including a baseline study), developing
training tool kits, and developing farming system models, a framework for watershed
management was established to ensure the sustainability of development plans at the community
level. Over 100 percent of the Fadama Community Associations adopted sustainable land use
planning practices in the implementation of their LDPs. About 47 LDPs were produced and
implemented.

73.     The project also conducted training for all relevant stakeholders. Members of SWSs in all
participating states received training in sustainable land use planning at the watershed level,
improving the sustainability of development planning at the community level, and integrated
farming and sustainable agriculture at the Songhai farms in Benin. The project supported
completion of a review of watershed policies and regulations, and the recommendations were
implemented effectively. The project also facilitated 98 quarterly meetings, with representatives
from about 12 sectors, for SWSs in the six states. All Fadama Community Associations were
sensitized to watershed management approaches; now they can prepare and implement their
respective frameworks for watershed management.

74.    The project also built a well-equipped and functional GIS laboratory with the capacity to
produce A0 maps.8 The lab has facilitated mapping and geo-referencing of all intervention sites
and subprojects and helped identify 127 communities around project sites.

Component 2: Integrated Ecosystem Management at Watershed Level

75.     Component 2 financed technical, social, and location-specific activities to improve the
management of critical watersheds in ways that increased the productivity and sustainability of
Fadama areas. This objective was achieved by financing a range of advisory services, including
training, capacity building, and awareness creation campaigns on watershed management that
ensured the protection of critical watersheds and improved water management. Achievement of
this component is rated satisfactory. Table 2.2 depicts the component’s key performance
indicators.

1.        By end of project, a management plan for Oguta Lake is               0               1                    1
          prepared and implemented.
2.        By end of project, 50% of LDPs have implemented and                 0%             50%                 100%

3.        By end of project, 3 community forest reserves have been             0               3                    6
          established in the participating states.

76.     At baseline the targeted communities had inadequate data on community forests, lacked a
management plan, lacked data for the management of Oguta Lake, lacked data on groundwater
(including groundwater levels, extraction, and recharge); and had no effective and integrated
coordination mechanism for managing watersheds. To improve this situation, the project
conducted and completed a study on the development of a management plan for Lake Oguta and
organized a stakeholders’ workshop to ensure its implementation.

77.     The project also targeted 50 percent of LDPs to implement an improved groundwater
management strategy. The project exceeded this target: 100 percent of LDPs now use an
improved groundwater management strategy. In absolute terms, this means that all 958
subprojects included within LDPs feature better groundwater management by planting trees and
pursuing related subprojects. To ensure effective data collection, a study on improved
groundwater management and the impact of reservoir management was completed. The
participating Fadama Community Associations and Fadama User Groups received training in
data collection.

78.     The project supported the identification of six community forest reserves compared with
its target of three; all six have been beaconed and digitally mapped. The project also identified
and supported the management of more than 18,800.97 hectares of forest reserves in the six
intervention sites, where about15, 853.40 hectares of beneficiaries’ farm holdings have come

under sustainable land management practices. The combined area under sustainable land
management in the Andiwa Lake, Lake Oguta, and Eriti Watersheds rose from a baseline of
7,421.4 hectares to 11,635.23 hectares by the end of the project

79.     Other significant outputs under this component include: (i) studies on the sustainable
management of the six community forest reserves, including the preparation of forest
management plans for the six intervention sites; (ii) formation and inauguration of forest
management committees at the community level to implement the plans; (iii) preparation of a
management plan for Lake Oguta; (iv) studies on improved groundwater management in the six
intervention sites and the impact of reservoir management on the water flow regime in Fadama
areas; (v) installation of three groundwater monitoring wells; and (vi) about 205 awareness
campaigns, launched by the Federal Government of Nigeria team at each of the six intervention
sites.

Component 3: Community Sustainable Land Management
80.      This component supported community members, including those who did not belong to
Fadama Community Associations, through community groups, NGOs, and Fadama Community
Associations to develop local initiatives that enhance the structural and functional integrity of
ecosystems, especially sustainable land use practices that improve rural livelihoods. The
achievement of this component is rated satisfactory. Table 2.3 shows the key output indicators
for this component.

     for highly degraded areas and are being implemented.

81.     At the CEMP’s inception, except for around 2 percent of subprojects for advisory
services under the main Fadama II Project, no beneficiary communities had sustainable land
management subprojects in their LDPs. Data on participating communities were lacking; data on
types of alternative livelihood activities were limited; there were no lists of agreed alternative
livelihood activities; and no data were available on highly degraded areas. The CEMP improved
this situation tremendously, exceeding its target of 50 percent of Fadama Community
Associations implementing alternative livelihood activities to achieve a remarkable 100 percent.
This result was achieved by organizing more than 205 sensitization and awareness programs.
Beneficiaries in more than 60 participating communities implemented about 10 alternative
livelihood activities (such as apiaries, ruminant fattening, and grasscutter, rabbit, and snail
production) through 520 subprojects. These activities generated ₦ 11.5 million as income for
beneficiaries. Component 3 also greatly exceeded the target of preparing and implementing 60
percent of management plans for highly degraded areas: More than 958 plans (92 percent) were
prepared to address water and land degradation issues.

Component 4: Project Management and Monitoring and Evaluation
82.    This component financed activities to strengthen project management mechanisms,
including M&E, to make them more effective at the federal and state levels. The achievement of
this component is rated satisfactory. Table 2.4 shows the key output indicators for this
component.

83.     Under this component, the Fadama GEF Desk Office established within the National
Fadama Coordination Office managed and coordinated all consultancies, training, workshops,
and project activities at the national level under the guidance and supervision of the National
Project Coordinator. At baseline, no specific coordination and management system for the GEF
projects, including an M&E plan, was in place. The CEMP established an M&E system for the
GEF-financed projects, which was fully mainstreamed into the main Fadama II Project, and it
installed a management information system format to track data on implementation more
effectively and efficiently. The M&E system was also to capture the land degradation problem at
baseline and the improvement in land productivity due to project intervention. While Table 2.5
summarized the prevalent land degradation and environmental problems across the six
intervention sites, the productivity of the high value crops grown by the beneficiaries were
tracked during the life of the project and the result is summarized in Table 2.6. Tables 2.7 and
2.8 showed the summary and disaggregation of land areas put under sustainable land
management in the six intervention sites.

Annex 3. Economic and Financial Analysis

84.     The CEMP interventions encompassed demand-driven productive environmental and
livelihood investments with capacity building for Environmental Officers, Fadama Community
Associations, and Fadama User Groups at the state and community level, with support for
alternative livelihood activities and project management. Unlike the alternative livelihood
activities, certain project activities, such as capacity building and project management, did not
generate direct economic benefits. However, a quick glance at the CEMP portfolio shows that a
significant proportion of investments financed alternative livelihood interventions (such as
apiaries, ruminant fattening, and grass cutter rearing, rabbit, and snail production). Through these
activities, implemented under four major subprojects, beneficiaries accrued substantial economic
benefits. Table 3.1 provides a summary of subprojects in the six intervention areas.

85.     To ascertain the economic viability of CEMP interventions, the evaluation team
performed an economic and financial analysis for four major subprojects: (i) apiaries for honey
production, (ii) teak woodlots for pole production, (iii) establishment of grass cutter farms with a
startup size of two families, and (iv) rearing of small ruminants (30 male and 10 female Belami
sheep).

Rationale and assumptions for selecting the four enterprises:

86.     The rationale for selecting these four interventions was based on beneficiaries’ interest in
maintaining their operations compared to other interventions. Although they constitute a small
proportion about 37% of the entire subprojects, the assessment team sought to focus on them due
to the high level of interest exhibited by beneficiaries in continuing with their production after
the end of the project. For apiary, beneficiaries indicated they would like to maintain its
production because it has high income yielding potential and requires minimal land and capital
requirement. With regard to grass cutter farming, beneficiaries showed interest in continuing
with its production because it promotes reduction in bush burning, is easy to manage, is
delicious, and interesting to rear. For Belami sheep, they indicated high income yielding
potential as the main reason for engaging in its production. Finally, the beneficiaries cited
availability of funds from subprojects, and anticipated increased income and benefits, and
environmental protection as reasons for maintaining woodlot production9. Overall the analysis
assumed (i) the four selected projects were based on the average minimum size of the enterprise
that would ensure timely and sustainable profitability of the investment and; (ii) the
appropriateness of the duration or cycle of the project based on the nature of the project and
expected output. Specifically, the analysis assumed:

       10 hives as sufficient size to start with apiary production for sustainable and reasonable
        level of profit. And a five- year production cycle for apiary as major related activities in
        the production process have a lifespan of about 5 years.
       An average honey yield of 7 liters per hive for the first year and average of 10 liters per
        hive in subsequent years harvestable two times per annum could be achieved from the
        nature of apicultural technology popularly used in Nigeria.
       The establishment of woodlot has multiplicity of purposes, including for providing
        firewood, fruits, poles and timber. Field observations showed that teak, (a fast growing
        species with the ability to stabilize degraded soil and used for production of firewood,
        poles and timber) was planted in the woodlot. The best economic output from teak within
        a moderate rotation period is production of pole. So the analysis was based on the
        establishment of teak woodlot for pole production with a rotation period of 10-12 years.
        This period was considered long enough to stabilize the soil and to also bring out an
        economic product beneficial to the individual farmers and the community at large.
       Due to difficulty in obtaining data, Belami sheep rearing was used to represent small
        ruminants; and 30 males and 10 females of Belami sheep were assumed to be reasonable
        herd size that would ensure sustainable profitability of the investment. The males were to

         be fattened and 28 of which would be sold at the end of year two for revenue generation.
         The remaining two would be retained for mating with the 10 females for breeding. It was
         also assumed that at least 7 of the 10 female animals would give birth to 2 kids for a total
         of 14 kids, and 12 kids would be added to the herds after every 6 months. A provision for
         20% mortality rate was made.
        The parent stock of two Families made up of 10 grass cutters were assumed to give birth
         once in the first year. Production of the parent stock was assumed to be once in the first
         year because the animals require time to acclimatize to the new environment. Besides, it
         was assumed that one Doe female animal would give birth to an average of four kids at a
         time, the eight Does in the two families of parent stock would give birth to 32 kids.
         Assumed a mortality rate of 20%, and 25 kids would be left out of the 32.
         A 16 percent discount rate was used as a proxy for average opportunity cost of capital,
         based on the average bank lending rate in Nigeria.
        A five-year horizon was assumed for apiary, grass cutter, and rearing of Belami sheep,
         while 12 years period was assumed for teak woodlot due to its long production period.
        The analysis used the maximum capital risk (MCR) ---the present value of investment at
         a point where the investor is exposed--- approach to calculating the benefit-cost ratio
         (BCR). The formula for calculating BCR is: BCR=NPV/MCR+1

Results:

87.     Upon the basis of the above rationale and assumptions, the combined benefit costs
analysis of the four enterprises generated a total NPV of ₦5,367,020.42, a BCR of 10.73, and
ERR of 212%. Table 3.2 below summarizes the results of the analysis, which clearly show that
the project’s beneficiaries would derive substantial benefits from continuing with the production
of the activities the four enterprises.

Comparison with appraisal estimates.

88.     CEMP specific economic and financial analysis was not undertaken at appraisal.
However, the preparation team drew conclusions from the results of the economic and financial
analysis conducted under the main Fadama II project. The analysis as contained in the PAD
assumed that the demand-driven nature of the project’s activities was expected to generate
economic benefits that would result in increased agriculture, livestock, and aquaculture
production as well as sustainable use of Fadama land and water resources. The team estimated
22% economic rate of return (ERR), based on the results of analysis of the main Fadama II
project, for the implementation of GEF interventions. As shown in the above tables, total ERR
of 212% far outweigh the appraisal estimate, which indicates that the project is economically and
financially viable, and very cost efficient.

Conclusion.

89.    The results of the analysis show that the total ERR of the four interventions (apiary, teak
woodlots, grass cutter farming, and the sheep) were estimated at 212% with NPV of
N5,367,020.42, and benefit-cost ratio of 8.43 of investments in the four interventions.
Investments in all the four enterprises show promising and sustainable profitability.

Annex 5. Beneficiary Assessment Survey

90.      To evaluate the project’s impacts on beneficiaries, a beneficiary assessment survey was
conducted at the end of the project. The survey used household data collected from the six
participating states. Stratified sampling technique was adopted and the three groups were: (i)
CEMP and Fadama II beneficiaries; (ii) Fadama II beneficiaries and (iii) respondents who did
not benefit from CEMP or Fadama II project. 10 households were randomly selected from the
total list of the three stratified groups in each state to arrive at a total of 180 respondents. Among
other things, the survey found that about 92% of CEMP beneficiaries confirmed that capacity
building impacted on their livelihood pattern, 70% of Fadama II beneficiaries felt the same,
while 20% of non CEMP and Fadama II attest that capacity building had impacts on their
livelihood pattern. The trend of CEMP and Fadama II seems reasonable given the fact that
capacity building is well built into Fadama II and the CEMP projects. The survey also showed
that beneficiaries were generally satisfied with the support they received from project
interventions and that the project had three significant types of impact: direct economic benefits
to beneficiaries, improvements in beneficiaries’ capacity for sustainable land management, and
environmental benefits.

Direct Economic Benefits
91.     Estimates of the total impact of the CEMP on its beneficiaries compared with those who
did not participate clearly revealed that the project had a large impact on the well-being of
beneficiaries. The project’s capacity-building interventions in integrated ecosystem management
and sustainable land management positively influenced beneficiaries’ livelihoods through higher
yields and savings, good agricultural practices, afforestation, and the provision of better water
sources for higher productivity. The survey showed that CEMP had a large impact on the change
in the level of expenditure of the 7,688 household beneficiaries when compared to the non
beneficiaries with a net impact of N8, 667. In addition, more than 50% of CEMP beneficiaries
are ready to continue with all sub-projects after the support is closed, especially the
implementation of Community forest, grass cutter farming, woodlots and orchards.

Improved Capacity for Sustainable Land Management
92.     Through the capacity-building interventions, over 50 percent of the project’s
beneficiaries are now empowered, ready, and willing to continue implementing subprojects in
community afforestation, grasscutter rearing, snail farming, and woodlots and orchards. The
subprojects’ enhanced income potential (especially for grasscutter and snail production,
woodlots, orchards, and apiaries), high productive capability, low technical requirements, and
ease of management are the key reasons for beneficiaries’ high enthusiasm.

93.    The survey shows that at baseline, the local benefiting communities had minimum or no
SLM plans (approximately 2% of subproject mainly on advisory services under Fadama-II).
However, at mid-term, 48 LDPs and 958 subprojects on SLM were mainstreamed into
development plans by the communities and were funded by CEMP. A total land area of 600 ha
was planted with different tree species across the six participating states. Up to 95% achievement
was recorded across the states with Kwara state exceeding her target.

Environmental Benefits
94.     62.82% of beneficiaries (farmers) confirmed that soil erosion was considerably reduced
because of the project. 77.27% of beneficiaries also testified that bush burning had decreased
significantly as a result of project interventions.

Annex 7. Summary of Borrower’s ICR and/or Comments on Draft ICR

95.     The CEMP is a pilot project that supports Fadama User Groups to carry out incremental
activities that address regional and global environmental issues within the Fadama catchment
areas. The Project was declared effective on 26th July 2006, and the implementation period was
from 2006 to 2011. The four components were: (i) Capacity Building; (ii) Integrated Ecosystem
Management at Watershed Level; (iii) Community Sustainable Land Management; and (iv)
Project Management and Monitoring and Evaluation. The project covers one intervention site in
each of the six implementing states, comprising Bauchi (Andiwa Lake Watersheds), Imo (Oguta
Lake Watersheds), Kebbi (Jega-Dumbegu Watersheds), Kogi (Koton Karfe Watersheds), Kwara
(Ajasse-Ipo Watersheds), and Ogun (Eriti Watersheds). The project was in the last quarter of the
final year of implementation (Oct. to Dec. 2011) at the time of the review. The key PDO is to
enhance the sustained productivity of Fadama areas and the livelihood systems they support
through sustainable land use and water management.

96.     Project implementation witnessed significant strides in the six intervention sites,
especially with the achievement of the three project outcome indicators. Despite the early
challenges, the second half of the project (following the Mid-term Review) saw disbursement
greatly improve from about 52 percent to about 99 percent as at the end of October 2011
(including firm commitments). Subproject implementation (mostly the second batch) was almost
fully completed, all statutory studies completed, and recommendations duly implemented.
This study was conducted to provide information on the status of the CEMP, a community-
driven development project, at its completion. The Fadama II Critical Ecosystem Management
project is a five-year project with three specific PDOs, making sure that by the end of the project:
(i) sustainable watershed management coordination capacity is established in at least 60 percent
of the participating states; (ii) sustainable land and water management practices are
mainstreamed in LDPs in at least 35 percent of the participating communities; and iii) area under
sustainable land and water management practices in the three pilot sites has increased by at least
80 percent.
97.       In relation to this, the terms of reference for the study were as follows:
         Assess project performance and implementation progress relative to plan; especially the
          review and documentation of the progress made towards the three outcome indicators:
          (i) by project end, sustainable watershed management coordination capacity established
          in at least 60 percent of the participating states; (ii) by project end, sustainable land and
          water management practices are mainstreamed into local development plans in at least 35
          percent of the participating communities; and (iii) by project end, the area under
          sustainable land and water management practices in the three pilot sites has increased by
          at least 80 percent.
         Other terms of reference included: Assessing the extent of achievement of project targets
          with respect to the execution of component activities; assessing the performance of the
          participating State Governments and Local Government Councils; and assessing the level
          of beneficiaries’ empowerment.

98.    This study also assessed the project’s compliance with World Bank Environmental
safeguards/Nigeria Environmental Laws and clauses of the Grant Agreement, especially with
                                                   43 
                                                     
regard to financial management and disbursement-related issues. It also included procurement
issues, implementation challenges, and lessons learnt that could be useful for future projects.

99.     In addition to the detailed review of progress reports from the national and state offices,
this study used household data collected from six CEMP beneficiary states. The sampling
procedure involved selection of 30 respondents from the total list of beneficiaries in each of the
six states, thereby arriving at a total of 180 respondents. The sampling frame was stratified to
ensure that all the Fadama Community Associations and female respondents were represented in
the study. The survey made use of two-stage sampling techniques, with the first stage of
sampling carried out at the Fadama Community Association level (i.e., random selection of
Fadama User Groups from Fadama Community Associations). The second involved random
selection of project beneficiaries while making sure that the sampling methodology was
proportionate to size. Project staff at the state and federal levels were also interviewed to access
information needed (most especially through questionnaires and by collection of project progress
reports) to resolve the terms of reference for the study. In all, six M&E officers, six
environmental officers, and six procurement officers in all the states were interviewed, while the
M&E officer and the procurement officer at the national office were also interviewed.
100. Results revealed a 100 percent “yes? answer from all states beneficiaries and SWS
members regarding whether watershed management coordination capacity exists in CEMP
beneficiary states. The project’s progress reports also supported this fact. As at the period of
beneficiary assessment, 83 percent of the six states’ respondents attested to the fact that there
exist watershed management coordination capacities in the concerned states. The 100 percent
“yes? response from all the participating stakeholders in the states clearly shows that the project
exceeded the minimum key performance indicator of having, at the end of the project,
sustainable watershed management coordination capacity established in at least 60 percent of
participating states. Since implementation of this PDO surpasses the original plan in the PAD, it
is rated Highly Satisfactory.

101. The 100 percent “yes? response from two key participating stakeholders in the states
clearly shows that the project exceeded the minimum key performance indicator, exceeding the
35 percent cutoff point that sustainable land and water management practices be mainstreamed
into LDPs of participating states. Given the fact that the implementation of this PDO exceeds the
original plan (using survey results and project progress reports) as stipulated in the PAD, it is
rated Highly Satisfactory.

102. The average achievement with respect to the third PDO (i.e., area under sustainable land
and water management practices in the three pilot sites to increase by at least 80 percent by
project end) in the three pilot sites of Bauchi, Imo, and Ogun States stood at about 87.1 percent.
Going by this result, this third PDO is as well rated Highly Satisfactory. When achievements
recorded in the other three CEMP beneficiary states are incorporated, the achievement rate was
found to be 154.8 percent.




                                                44 
                                                  
Component-wise Ratings
103. Based on the responses of CEMP project staff at both the national and state coordination
offices and project progress reports on the capacity-building component, there was little
emphasis on the implementation of activities to promote sustainable harvest techniques for forest
products and fishing. However, since four out of the five activities of the component can be
adjudged well implemented, this component of the project is rated Satisfactory.

104. On the other hand, all activities of the Integrated Ecosystem Management at Watershed
Level component were properly implemented. The progress report on the four activities of
Integrated Ecosystem Management at Watershed Level and the responses from the respondents
showed that the project achieved far above average in terms of proper implementation; hence this
component of the project is rated Highly Satisfactory.

105. Given the fact that responses and project progress report on the performance of
implementation of the two activities in the Community Sustainable Land Management
component is above average, despite the challenges at the initial stage of project implementation,
the component is rated Satisfactory.

106. The main issue under the Project Management and Monitoring and Evaluation
component is that not more than half of project staff believed that regular monitoring was
properly carried out. However, based on the fact that the performance of this component of the
project, in terms of implementation, can be implied as substantial through respondents’ responses
and project progress reports, this component of the project is rated Satisfactory.

107. All state project staff agreed that states were providing the right support in the area of
institutional arrangements and support. Findings also showed that half of state project staff
agreed that local governments were providing the right support in the area of institutional
arrangements, while all agreed that they provided robust institutional support for the project.

108. The CEMP, based on the findings, substantially empowered beneficiaries in the areas of
decision making, funds transfer, awareness of sustainable land and water management practices,
adoption of sustainable land and water management practices, and sustainability and up-scaling
of sustainable land and water management practices. The project, therefore, can be said to have
performed Highly Satisfactorily in the area of empowering beneficiary’s capacity in watershed
and ecosystem management. Results also revealed that most beneficiaries confirmed that CEMP
activities affected the way beneficiaries and non-beneficiaries made money to pay for food, a
place to live, clothing, and how much assistance they had been able to give to their children and
relatives. The project is therefore rated to have performed Satisfactorily with respect to its
impact on the livelihood of beneficiaries and non-beneficiaries.

109. Results from the analysis of responses to the sixth term of reference revealed that 75
percent of respondents agreed to the fact that the project considered environmental
safeguards/laws to ensure sustainable utilization of natural resources and preservation of the
ecosystem. The rest of the results also revealed that 75 percent and about 67 percent of
respondent attested to the fact that the project considered environmental safeguards/laws to
ensure waste management and environmental monitoring and auditing plans, respectively. Based

                                               45 
                                                 
on the weight of “yes? responses on the part of respondents and project’s progress report, this
project is scored Satisfactory in ensuring that World Bank environmental safeguards and
Nigeria Environmental Laws were observed while implementing the project.

110. Results on the project’s compliance with the international agencies’ grant agreement
revealed that more than half of state projects’ procurement staff agreed to the fact that the project
followed grant agreements set out by international agencies while implementing project
activities. Most of the procurement of goods and services were carried out at the national
coordination office. Only community-based procurement for subproject activities was facilitated
by the state coordination office. However, the federal procurement officer (where the majority of
the procurement activities actually took place) affirmed that procurement guidelines were
complied with while implementing the project. The project drive in complying with grant
agreement of International agencies is rated Satisfactory.

LESSONS LEARNT AND CHALLENGES FOR IMPLEMENTING THE THREE PDOs
111.   Lessons Learnt for Watershed Management and Coordination Capacity
      The establishment and inclusion of the State Watershed Subcommittee (SWS) in the
       project implementation led to reduction in the duplication of efforts and gaps in
       watershed management.
      Knowledge sharing amongst SWS members provided the needed complementarily
       amongst stakeholders.
      Involvement of SWS members in awareness creation/sensitization, training, and technical
       assistance to the Fadama User Groups and Fadama Community Associations helped in
       capturing and promoting the priorities of the various watershed management
       stakeholders.
Challenges for watershed management and coordination capacity
      Irregularity of SWS meeting.
      Members not readily available because of other state assignment (especially when they
       are very senior officers).
112.   Lessons Learnt for Sustainable Land and Water Management Practices
       Mainstreamed into LDPs
      Beneficiaries are quite aware of the various forms of degradation; they have also noticed
       an increasing trend in land degradation but have not been able to do anything substantial
       because their immediate source of livelihood could not be easily traded for any future
       benefits.
      Adequate sensitization and provision of alternative livelihood is imperative to achieve
       this PDO. Also, sustainable land management practices with short- to medium-term
       returns to investment are more preferred.
113. Challenges for sustainable land and water management practices mainstreamed
into LDPs
     Inadequate training of beneficiaries before committing resources.
     Gestation period of most sustainable land management activity is long.
     Benefit of most sustainable land management activities is of public nature.

                                                 46 
                                                   
      Land tenure system remains a big challenge.
114. Lessons Learnt on Area under Sustainable Land and Water Management Practices
in the Three Pilot Sites Must Have Increased by at Least 80 Percent
     The need for recognition and documentation of indigenous sustainable land management
       activities.
     The need for documentation of the actual size of the intervention site in digital map with
       the coordinates of the communities within the area.
     The need for using GPS to get more accurate data on land size and for mapping.

115. Challenges on area under sustainable land and water management practices in the
three pilot sites must have increased by at least 80 percent
    The main challenge was the more accurate estimation of land degradation, especially on
       individual farm holdings. Beneficiaries are not readily disposed to adopting tree planting
       activities but rather interested in activities with a shorter gestation period
