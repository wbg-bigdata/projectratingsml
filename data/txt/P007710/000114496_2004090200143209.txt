                (under terms of reference set forth in the operational
                manual referred to in Section 4.04 of this Agreement) the
                action plans, evaluation schemes and indicators referred to
Page  24
                in such operational manual; and (B) report every six months

                on the progress of the FA Subproject (as such progress is
                measured by the indicators referred to in said

    (h)   Contractual provisions set forth or referred to in subparagraphs
(e), (f) or (g) of this paragraph need not be set forth in detail in an FA

Agreement contains a clause obligating the FA Subborrower (and its State
when such State is a party to such FA Subloan Agreement) to abide by the
terms of such operational manual.
5.  No expenditures for goods, works or services required for a Subproject
shall be eligible for financing out of the proceeds of the Loan unless:

          other outstanding amounts of SWM Subloans for investments in the
          same municipality, shall not exceed the sum of $10,000,000
          equivalent; and
(iii) every FA Subloan for the first two municipal FA Subborrowers that

the information referred to in paragraph 3 (a) of Schedule 5 to the Loan
Text for the Second Water Supply and Sanitation Sector Project; (ii) in the
case of an SWM Subloan, the information referred to in paragraph 3 (a) of
Schedule 5 to the Loan Text for the Second Solid Waste Management Project;

FA Subloan Agreement and, in the case of an FA Subloan for a diagnostic
component referred to in Section 1.02 (t) (i) of this Agreement, any
prediagnostic of the relevant FA Subborrower carried out by the Borrower in
preparation therefor, as well as, in the case of an FA Subloan for an
implementation component referred to in Section 1.02 (t) (ii) of this
Agreement, the diagnostic carried out by the FA Subborrower in preparation

the reasonable cost of goods and services required for the Project and to
be financed out of the proceeds of the Loan allocated from time to time to
the eligible Categories in accordance with the provisions of Schedule 1 to
this Agreement; and
    (c)   the term "Authorized Allocation" means an amount equivalent to
$16,000,000 to be withdrawn from the Loan Account and deposited in the
Special Account pursuant to paragraph 3 (a) of this Schedule.
2.  Payments out of the Special Account shall be made exclusively for
eligible expenditures in accordance with the provisions of this Schedule.
3.  After the Bank has received evidence satisfactory to it that the Special
Account has been duly opened, withdrawals of the Authorized Allocation and
subsequent withdrawals to replenish the Special Account shall be made as
follows:
    (a)   For withdrawals of the Authorized Allocation, the Borrower shall
furnish to the Bank a request or requests for a deposit or deposits which
do not exceed the aggregate amount of the Authorized Allocation. On the
basis of such request or requests, the Bank shall, on behalf of the
Borrower, withdraw from the Loan Account and deposit in the Special Account
such amount or amounts as the Borrower shall have requested.
    (b)   (i)   For replenishment of the Special Account, the Borrower
                shall furnish to the Bank requests for deposits into the
                Special Account at such intervals as the Bank shall
                specify.
         (ii)   Prior to or at the time of each such request, the Borrower
                shall furnish to the Bank the documents and other evidence                
required pursuant to paragraph 4 of this Schedule for the
                payment or payments in respect of which replenishment is
                requested. On the basis of each such request, the Bank
                shall, on behalf of the Borrower, withdraw from the Loan
                Account and deposit into the Special Account such amount as
                the Borrower shall have requested and as shall have been
                shown by said documents and other evidence to have been
                paid out of the Special Account for eligible expenditures.
    All such deposits shall be withdrawn by the Bank from the Loan Account
under the respective eligible Categories, and in the respective equivalent
amounts, as shall have been justified by said documents and other evidence.
4.  For each payment made by the Borrower out of the Special Account, the
Borrower shall, at such time as the Bank shall reasonably request, furnish
to the Bank such documents and other evidence showing that such payment was
made exclusively for eligible expenditures.
Page  26
5.  Notwithstanding the provisions of paragraph 3 of this Schedule, the Bank
shall not be required to make further deposits into the Special Account:
    (a)   if, at any time, the Bank shall have determined that all further
withdrawals should be made by the Borrower directly from the Loan Account
in accordance with the provisions of Article V of the General Conditions and
paragraph (a) of Section 2.02 of this Agreement; or
    (b)   once the total unwithdrawn amount of the Loan allocated to the
eligible Categories, less the amount of any outstanding special commitment
entered into by the Bank pursuant to Section 5.02 of the General Conditions
with respect to the Project, shall equal the equivalent of twice the amount
of the Authorized Allocation.
    Thereafter, withdrawal from the Loan Account of the remaining
unwithdrawn amount of the Loan allocated to the eligible Categories shall
follow such procedures as the Bank shall specify by notice to the Borrower.
Such further withdrawals shall be made only after and to the extent that the
Bank shall have been satisfied that all such amounts remaining on deposit
in the Special Account as of the date of such notice will be utilized in
making payments for eligible expenditures.
6.  (a)   If the Bank shall have determined at any time that any payment out
of the Special Account: (i) was made for an expenditure or in an amount not
eligible pursuant to paragraph 2 of this Schedule; or (ii) was not justified
by the evidence furnished to the Bank, the Borrower shall, promptly upon
notice from the Bank: (A) provide such additional evidence as the Bank may
request; or (B) deposit into the Special Account (or, if the Bank shall so
request, refund to the Bank) an amount equal to the amount of such payment
or the portion thereof not so eligible or justified. Unless the Bank shall
otherwise agree, no further deposit by the Bank into the Special Account
shall be made until the Borrower has provided such evidence or made such
deposit or refund, as the case may be.
    (b)   If the Bank shall have determined at any time that any amount
outstanding in the Special Account will not be required to cover further
payments for eligible expenditures, the Borrower shall, promptly upon notice
from the Bank, refund to the Bank such outstanding amount.
    (c)   The Borrower may, upon notice to the Bank, refund to the Bank all
or any portion of the funds on deposit in the Special Account.
    (d)   Refunds to the Bank made pursuant to paragraphs 6 (a), (b) and (c)
of this Schedule shall be credited to the Loan Account for subsequent
withdrawal or for cancellation in accordance with the relevant provisions
of this Agreement, including the General Conditions.

a new subparagraph (k) is added to read:
          "(k)  An extraordinary situation shall have arisen under which any
    further withdrawals under the Loan would be inconsistent with the
    provisions of Article III, Section 3 of the Bank's Articles of
    Agreement."
3.  The words "the Bank may, by notice to the Borrower and the Guarantor,
terminate the right of the Borrower to make withdrawals with respect to such
amount. Upon the giving of such notice, such amount of the Loan shall be
cancelled" set forth at the end of Section 6.03 are deleted and the
following is substituted therefor: "or (f) by the date specified in
paragraph 6 (b) of Schedule 5 to the Loan Agreement or in paragraph 4 (b)
of Schedule 1 of the Guarantee Agreement, the Bank shall, in respect of any
portion of the Loan: (i) have received no applications permitted under
paragraph 6 (a) of Schedule 5 to the Loan Agreement or paragraph 4 (a) of
Schedule 1 to the Guarantee Agreement; or (ii) have denied any such
applications, the Bank may, by notice to the Borrower and the Guarantor,
Page  27
terminate the right of the Borrower to submit such applications or to make
withdrawals from the Loan Account, as the case may be, with respect to such
amount or portion of the Loan. Upon the giving of such notice, such amount
or portion of the Loan shall be cancelled.".\1a
