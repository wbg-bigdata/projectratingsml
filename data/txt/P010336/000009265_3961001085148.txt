SECOND ENERGY SECTOR LOAN (ESL II)
SUPPLEMENTAL LOAN TO LOAN 3107-PAR
Loan Sumary
Borrower:               Islamic Republic of Pakistan
Beneficiaries:          Sui Southern Gas Company Limited (SSGC) and
Water and Power Developmert Authority (WAPDA)
Amount:                 US$28.0 million equivalent
Terms:                  To be repaid on the same payment dates as the existing
loan at the Bank's standard variable interest rate, with
semi-annual payments from March 1, 1995 through
September 1, 2009.
On-lending Terms:       The Government of Pakistan (GOP) will on-lend US4i6
million equivalent from the Bank supplemental loan to
SSGC at 14X per annum and US$12 million to WAPDA at 11%
per annum, with the same repayment dates us Loan 3107-
PAK, with the Government bearing the foreign exchange
risk.
ObJectives:             As a supplement to the ongoing Investment Program under
the Second Energy Sector Loan (Loan 3107-PAK) the Loan
would provide additional assistance to GOP for two
priority energy sector projects in the agreed least cost
Core Investment Program (CIP) of SSGC and WAPDA whose
implementation is affected by the adverse impact on
Pakistan's balance of payments resulting from Gulf
crisis. The SSGC component for installation of a lx120
MMCFD gas purification plant would help SSGC's gas
delivery capacity, which was curtailed in 1990 by a fire
that destroyed old gas purification equipment, and would
reduce the imports of petroleum products.  The WAPDA
component which is to modify the Kot Addu power plant
to permit the use of natural gas in lieu of diesel oil,
would also reduce import of petroleum products.   In
addition, the increased use of gas, a clean burning fuel,
in both projects wotuld have a beneficial environmental
impact for Pakistan.

- it -
Deseriptiop:            The Supplemental Loan would: (a) cover all of the foreign
exchange cost of goods and services for the installation
of a lxl20 HMCFD gas purification plant for SSGC; and
part of the foreign exchange cost of gas conversion
equipment to be installed at WAPDA's Kot Addu Power Plant
to allow substitution of domestically supplied natural
gas for imported high speed diesel (HSD).
Rlisks                  The main risk associated with investments of this type
by SSGC and WAPDA would be delay in the procurement and
installation of the purification plant and conversion
equipment at Kot Addu. Both entities have initiated the
procurement process in accordance with Bank Guidelines
and  the  implementation  schedule  has  been  found
satisfactory to the Bank. As the proposed investments
are to be implemented as expansion and modification to
existing facilities, they present no unusual risks.
Disbursements:          Disbursements of the proposed Supplemental Loan to GOP
allocated to SSCC and WAPDA would be contingent on the
release of the second tranche of ESL II (Loan 3107-
PAK).

RNORAN1DUM AND RECONMENATION 0? THE PRES-IDNT
OF MLELINERNATIO AL BANK FOR RICOh8TnwCTION AND DEVELODQ T
TO TUE EXCGUTIVK DIRECTORS ON A PROPOSED SlMPPLEMEA1L LOAN TO
THE ISLAIIC REPUBLIC OF PAKISTAN
1.        The following memorandum and recommendation on a proposed supplemental
loan of US$28 million equivalent to the Islamic Republic of Pakistan is submitted
for approval.   The loan to the Islamic Republic of Pakistan would be to
supplement the Second Energy Sector Loan (ESL II) (Loan 3107-PAK).   This
supplemental loan would be repaid on the same payment schedule as the existing
loan with interest at the Bank's standard variable rate.            Semi-annual
repayments would be made from March 1, 1995 through September 1, 2009.  The
equivalent of US$16 million from the proceeds of the supplemental loan for Loan
3107-PAK would be relent by the Government of Pakistan (GOP) to Sui Southern Gas
Company (SSGC) at an annual interest rate of 14X, and US$12 million to WAPDA at
an annual interest rate of 111, in both cases including administrative chiarges
and foreign exchange and interest rate risk premiums, with the same repayment
dates as those for the ongoing ESL II. The Borrower would bear the foreign
exchange risk.
Energy Resources
2.        Pakistan's commercially exploitable energy resources  consist of
hydropower, natural gas, oil and coal. The hydropower potential is estimated
at about 30,000 MW.  Proven reserves of natural gas are estimated at about
19.4 trillion cubic feet (TCF). Oil reserves, both probable and proven, are
estimated at about 58 million tons. Coal and lignite deposits are estimated at
about 900 million tons, of which 175 million tons are proven.  In addition, the
country has a large base of traditional fuels in the form of fuelwood and
agricultural and animal waste, which provide a major share of rural consumers'
energy needs. Despite its endowment of energy reaources, Pakistan's dependence
on imported liquid hydrocarbons is expected to continue over the foreseeable
future, particularly in light of the long lead time and vast financial resources
required for the implementation of the major hydro projeets. This dependence,
however, can be reduced by: accelerating the development of the smaller hydro
sites and of discovered oil and gas fields; encouraging the substitution of
domestic as well as imported coal for higher value petroleum products;
restraining the growth of demand through price and non-price measures, including
rehabilitation and retrofitting of power plants, refineries and energy-intensive
industries; and expanding and strengthening the implementation capabilities of
the entities involved in the sector.
Energy Supply/Demand Balances
3.        The forecast of energy demand for the period 1986-2010 calls for demand
increasing at an average annual rate of about 71 up to the mid-1990s and
declining gradually thereafter to about 6X. Although the output of domestic
energy resources especially of coal and hydropower and, to a lesser extent of
oil and gas, is forecast to increase, their share. in total supply is expected
to decline relative to that of imported energy. Consequently, in order to meet
the forecast demand at least cost, the share of coal, both imported and domestic,



- 2 -
in total consumwtion is forecast to increase from 71 in FY88 to about 211 in
FY2010 to subsuitute for higher value petroleum products. Despite this, the
share of petroleum products would increase from the present level of 391 to 501
in FY2010. By contrast, the share of gas is expected to decline significantly
to about 121, while given the long lead time and resources required to develop
the country's major hydro sites, the hydropower contribution to the overall
supply of energy is expected to increase only marginally to about 201.
4.        The Long-Term Energy Strategy (LES), formulated by the Government with
the assistance of the Bank in 1985, was aimed at initiating integrated structural
reforms with the objective of accelerating and rationalizing the development of
the energy sector (correcting distortions in energy pricing, strengthening the
institutions and increasing private sector involvement). In order to assist GOP
in implementing these reforms, a series of sector loans were envisaged by the
Bank, each in support of a monitorable core program of policy actions and
priority  investments.   The first phase of these reforms was implemented
successfully under the First Energy Sector Loan (ESL I) during the last three
years (FY86-88) of the Sixth Plan. Support for continuation of these reforms
is being provided under the ESL II which covers the first three years (FY89-
91) of the Seventh Plan.
LP_rogress under ESL II
5.        As a first step towards rationalizing investments and minimizing the
shortfalls in energy supply, a Core Investment Program (CIP) of priority projects
was agreed to under ESL II. The sources of financing for its implementation were
identified, including potential foreign financing, as well as the contribution
of GOP through the Annual Development Plan and that of the sector entities from
their internally-generated funds. The CIP comprises ongoing and new projects
to be implemented during the first three years (FY89-91) of the Seventh Plan by
b4t-h the public and private sectors. Progress in the implementation of the CIP
for FY89 and FY90 has been satisfactory in terms of both mobilization and
allocation of these resources for the agreed priority projects.
6.        A loan of US$250 million to GOP under ESL II was approved by the Bank
on June 29, 1989, signed on December 8, 1989 and became effective on March 8,
1990. The US$250 million provided in ESL II was divided into two portions of
US$125 million each for the adjustment and investment components, respectively.
These two portions were also divided into two tranches: US$75 million and US$50
million each for the adjustment component and US$80 million and US$45 million
each for the investment component. The release of the second tranche of both
components has been delayed pending fulfillment of the relevant conditions and
implementation of macroeconomic stabilization measures. However, the specific
tranche release conditions relating to power tariffs and consumer gas prices have
been met since GOP made adjustments to energy tariffs on April 1, 1991 in line
with the ESL II requirements. Currently only about US$116 million of the US$250
million under ESL II has been disbursed, due to the longer than normal time (nine
months) which was required to meet the conditions of Loan effectiveness, slower
than expected procurement of the investment component under the first tranche,
and delays in release of the second tranche. Due to these delays, the current
ESL II closing date of December 31, 1991 will be extended, under the amending
agreement, to December 31, 1993.

Ob1ectives of the SupMIemental Loan
7.        The primary objective of the proposed supplemental loan is to provide
additional assistance to GOP in the continued implementation of two priority
energy sector projects, included in the CIP agreed with the Bank and supported
by two ongoing Bank loans, which are adversely affected by foreign exchange
constraints due in large part to the effect of the Gulf crisis. The proposed
supplemental loan would assist: (a) SSGC in up6rading its capability for the
purification of gas to pipeline quality which was initiated under ESL II
(Loan 3107-PAK), but has been badly set back by a fire outbreak at the Sui
purification facility in November 1990; and (b) WAPDA in the conversion of its
combined cycle power plant at Kot Addu from imported diesel to domestic natural
gas, a cleaner and less costly fuel, a process initiated under the ongoing Kot
Addu Combined Cycle Power Project (Loan 2698-PAKR.
A.  Proposed USSl6 Million SlaDLement to SSGC
Project Description
8.        As part of the CIP agreed with the Bank under ESL II (para. 5), SSGC,
the gas company responsible for purification, transmission and distribution of
gas in the southern part of the country, was allocated US$5.0 million under the
Investment Component of ESL II. The Bank's financing was to supplement other
sources of foreign exchange financing, especially Asian Development Bank (ADB)
loans, provided for the expansion of its transmission and distribution network,
particularly the Indus Right Bank Pipeline  .Phase II) Project.  Of the US$5
million of Bank funds allocated to SSGC under ESL II, US$4.5 million was to
assist SSGC to finance the expansion of its distribution system, while US$500,000
was to be used for undertaking a study to identify future investments in the
revamping and modernization of SSGC's purification plants.
Prol ect Implementation
9.          SSCC's investment program has been reviewed and agreed with the Bank
on an annual basis as part of the annual review of the Energy Sector CIP provided
for under ESL II.  SSGC's progress in implementing the agreed CIP has been
satisfactory.   The implementation of the study to identify the specific
investments for the modernization of SSGC's aging gas purification plants, some
of which date from the 1950s, was overtaken by the occurrence of a fire at the
purification facility in November 1990 which destroyed one 120 MMCFD plant and
damaged adjacent purification plants. This has reduced total gas purification
capacity at Sui from 790 MMCFD to 540 MMCFD and constrained the ability of SSGC
to meet its current supply commitments of pipeline quality gas to consumers and
to purify the additional gas from new fields in the Sui area. A damage and
safety assessment prepared by SSGC after the November fire was reviewed by the
Bank and found satisfactory, and SSGC proposes to initiate immediately the
procurement of 2x120 MMCFD purification plants. These plants would utilize the
modern MEA (mono-ethanol-amine) process which efficiently absorbs sulphur
compounds and carbon dioxide.   The March 1991 appraisal mission findings
confitmed that the selected HEA process for the 120 MNCFD proposed purification
plants for SSGC would be similar to the most recent purification plant financed



- 4 -
by the Bank under the recently completed Loan 2324-PAK for SNGPL, the gas utility
operating in the north of Pakistan.
Project Cost and Pinalcing
10.       One of the plants to be procured is to be financed from the Bank's
proposed supplemental loan. For this purpose, US$16 million equivalent from the
proceeds of the proposed supplemental loan would be onlent by GOP to SSGC. SSGC
would procure a second purification plant of 120 MNCFD, under ADB financing.
The *otal cost of the purification plant and ancillary facilities to be financed
is c timated at US$29 million, including a foreign exchange component of US$16
million to be financed under the proposed supplemental loan. Furthermore, SSGC
has requested and the Bank has ag-eed that the US$500,000 for the study be
reallocated to complement the US$4.5 million allocation for materials and
equipment for its distribution system.
Procurement and Disbursement
11.       SSGC has already initiated the procurement of the proposed 120 MMCFD
capacity purification plant and ancillary facilities under ICB procedures in
accordance with Bank procurement guidelines. Disbursement of the US$5 million
allocated to SSGC under ESL II has been slow, but it is expected to pick up
shortly as a number of contract awards for about US$4 million have been made.
The disbursement of the proposed US$16 million for the purification plant would
be contingent on the release of the second tranche of the investment portion of
ESL II. The installation of the purification plant is expected to be completed
by early 1993.
Elnancial Position of SSGC
12.       Despite a reduction in its FY90 profit before taxes, from Rs 452.5
million to Rs 231.6 million, due to the higher cost of gas purchased from
producers of the Badin Gas fi31d and the increase in the gas development
surcharge by the Government, SSGC remains profitable. Net income after taxes
amounted to Rs 113.6 million in FY90, and the Company's net worth is now at
Rs 1.4 billion. The Company finances a major portion of its average capital
investments (63X in FY90) from internal resources. Its liquidity position is
sound, with a debt service coverage ratio of 2.7 and current ratio of 1.28 in
FY90. Overall receivables are about 2.0 months sales; however, the Company's
position with, respect to domestic consumers, which account for 171 of SSGC's
sales, is of concern, as receivables from domestic consumers represent 10.9
months of the domestic distribution unit's sales. Agreement has been reached
with GOP and SSGC that a program and timetable, satisfactory to the Bank, for
bringing average residential consumers accounts receivables below three months
billings will be developed and submitted to GOP and the Bank by December 31,
1991.
Justification for SSGC Component of SuMppemental Loan
13.       The loss of 250 MKCFD of purification capacity reduces pro-tanto SSGC's
ability to satisfy gas demand and forces the interruptible consumers (mostly
industrial, and commercial users) to resort to alteriative high valued imported



petroleum products. The early insta.lation of the proposed new purification
plants would allow SSGC to meet its current commitment of gas supply and would
substitute for an equivalent daily consumption of about 6,000 tons of imported
liquid fuels, equivalent to about US$400 million per year in foreign exchange
savings. Considering that the average cost of delivered gas to SSGC is Rs 9/MCF
and that its (weighted) average selling price is about ?ts 24.3/MCF, the financial
rate of return of the US$29 million investment exceeds 100l. The economic rate
of return, based on the international price of substitute fuels on a thermal
equivalent basis, would be at least twice as high. SSGC and the Government are
in compliance with all the existing covenants under the Loan Agreement.
14.       The main risk associated with this type of project would be delay in
the procurement and installation of the plant. SSGC has already initiated the
procurement procedure in accordance with Bank Guidelines. As to the impact on
the environment, the proposed plant would be an expansion to an existing
purification facility shared with SNGPL where Bank emission guidelines are being
complied with.   In addition, the standards for equipment and installation
procedures would conform to international practices.   The facility will be
located far from any residential area.
B. Progosed USSl2 NilliLo Suonlement to VA2DA
Project Description
15.       The current configuration of the Kot Addu power plant consists of eight
combustion turbine units, of which Units 1-4 are being converted, with partial
financing from the Kot Addu Combined Cycle Power Project (Loan 2698-PAK), to
combined cycle operation by addition of four heat recovery boilers and two steam
turbo generators. All units are currently fired by high speed diesel (HSD).
In light of the recently confirmed larger gas reserves in the newly discovered
Qadirpur gas field, to be developed under the proposed Domestic Energy Resources
Development Project which is planned to be presented to the Board in the first
quarter of FY92, WAPDA is undertaking modifications of the combustion turbines
to allow substitution of natural gas for HSD at all eight units of the Kot Addu
power plant.  The design of the conversion is based on proven technology.  It
has been reviewed by the Bank and found satisfactory.   A portion of the
additional costs for conversion of the turbines to use gas would be financed
under the proposed supplemental loan.
Project Implementation
16.       The conversion of four of the eight Kot Addu combustion turbines to
combined cycle operation under the Kot Addu Combined Cycle Power Project is being
executed by WAPDA, which has extensive experience in the irstallation and
operation of thermal power stations using steam units and combustion turbines,
and associated high voltage transmission systems. However, since the combined
cycle technology is new to Pakistan, with the Bank's agreement, consultants
(Labmayer International, Germany) have assisted WAPDA in implementing the
conversion process of the Kot Addu Combined Cycle Power Project. The performance



- 6 -
test for thv first of the two steam turbine units has been completed successfully
and the performance testing for the second unit is scheduled for the end of the
year.   WAPDA is ready to award contracts for the installetion of the gas
conversion equipment, as soon as financing is provided. About one year would
be required for the completion 3f the installation.
Proiect Cost and Financen;
17.       The conversion to gas use requires an additional irvestment of about
US$18.2 million equivalent, of which US$16.8 million would be in foreign
exchange.   As savings of about US$3.4 million have occurred in the foreign
exchange cost of installation of the combined cycle equipment to be financed
under Loan 2698-PAK, and as WAPDA was already allocated US$1.4 million under the
Investment Program of ESL II (Loan 3107-PAK) for the gas conversion equipment,
the resulting shortfall in foreign exchange for financing the gas conversion is
about US$12 million. It is, therefore, proposed to increase the allocation of
WAPDA under the Investment Program of ESL II from US$57.5 million to US$69.5
million, utilizing US$12 million, from the proposed supplemental loan. Total
Bank financing from both Loan 2698-PAK and Loan 3107-PAK for this project will
account for 77% of total project cost.
Procurement and Disbursement
18.       Bank guidelines are being followed in the procurement of all items to
be financed by the Bank (goods and consulting services).  Bank fin-ncing is
limited to foreign exchange costs. The conversion equipment would be procured
by WAPDA under international colmpetitive bidding procedures.   The  ank has
reviewed the bidding doctments, as well as the contract award procedures to be
used ior such procurement, and has found them satisfactory. As in the case of
the portion of the supplemental loan being allocated to SSGC, disbursement of
the proposed US$12 million for the procurement of gas conversion equipment would
be contingent on the release of the second tranche of the investment portion of
ESL II.  The installation of the gas conversion equipment is expected to be
completed by mid 1992.   Disbursements of the US$42 million first tranche
allocation for WAPDA under the Investment Program of ESL II has been satisfactory
with a remaining balance of US$20 million, which has been committed.
Financial Position of WAPDA
19.       WAPDA's electricity tariffs were increased on average,  etfective
July 1, 1990, by about 8.3% and again on April 1, 1991 by another 12X. As a
result, WAPDA is likely to finance from its internal cash generation about 40%
of the agreed investment program in FY91, as covenanted under Loans 2698-PAK and
3107-PAK. It is projected that WAPDA would be in compliance with the covenant
in FY92 on the basis of its current investment program. Another tariff increase
is expected to be required in FY92, however, to allow for a higher investment
program which is now needed to compensate for delays in private sector projects
for power and cost overruns stemming from slippages in project implementation.
Effective April 1, 1991, the security deposit rates for new connections have been
increased to conform with the current electricity charges. Furthermore, since
May 1, 1991, WAPDA is exempt from paying customs duties and taxes. Beth measures
are expected to increase WAPDA's resources, and should help increase its internal



cash generation capacity. WAPDA remains in compliance with the other financial
covenants (debt service coverage, audit and accounts receivables from government
agencies) in its loans from the Bank.
Justification for WAPDA Component of Supplemental Loan
20.       A major objective of WAPDA's CIP agreed undor ESI. II was to ensure the
generation of power at least cost. The conversion of four of the combustion
turbines at Kot Addu to combined cycle operation was to contribute significantly
to this objective by improving the thermal efficiency of the plant.   The
possibility of substituting natural gas for high valued imported HSD was also
contemplated, subject to the availability of gas. The discovery of additional
gas reserves in the Dhodak and Qadirpur fields has now made it possible to do
so.
21.       The proposed modifications to the combined cycle power plant at Kot
Addu, to be financed under the supplement to WAPDA's allocation in the ESL II
Investment Component, would result in the reduction of the import cost of
petroleum products (partic.ilarly HSD) for power generation by the substitution
of locally produced gas for HSD.   Foreign exchange savings, as a result of
replacement of HSD by natural gas, would amount to about US$38 million annually.
The current cost of gas to WAPDA for the Kot Addu plant is about US$80/toe as
compared to HSD at US$160/toe. Furthermore, utilization of gas would increase
the efficiency. availability and capacity factors of the plant (assumed at 601
for a base load combined cycle plant for units 1-4 and 301 for combustion turbine
units 5-8). The calculated economic rate of return for this conversion is about
50%.
Rationale for Bank Involvement in the Proposed Supplemental Loan
22.       The proposed replacement of reduced purification capacity for SSGC at
the Sui facility and the installation of gas conversion equipment at the Kot Addu
Combined Cycle Power Plant, are entering a critical phase in terms of activities
scheduling, whereby procurement action (either in contractor prequalification
or financial payments to contractors) must be maintained to avoid delays in
project  implementation.   It is in this context  that  the request for a
supplemental loan to the ongoing ESL II loan has been made by GOP, SSGC and
WAPDA.  Moreover, the recent Gulf crisis has exerted increased pressure on
Pakistan's foreign exchange reserves, which recently fell to a level equivalent
to less than two weeks imports. For 1991, the negative foreign exchange impact
due to tne Gulf crisis is tentatively estimated at about US$450 million. Given
this deterioration in the external account, special assistance in the form of
this proposed supplemental loan would be justified.   This supplement would
respond to the current resource constraints Pakistan is facing and safeguard the
timely completion of project components which are critical to meeting the demand
for supply of natural gas and electricity in the country.
ugreements Reached
23.       It has been agreed with GOP, SSGC and WAPDA,  that the proposed
supplemental loan to Loan 3107-PAK would be made to the Government and would be
relent under amended Subsidiary Loan Agreements to SSGC and WAPDA. The amendment



of the Subsiaiary Loan Agreements between GOP and each of SSGC and WAPDA,
respectively, under terms and conditions consistent with the amortization
schedule of the original Loan and supplemental loan, would be a condition of
effectiveness of the supplemental loan to GOP.
24.       Furthermore, it was agreed with GOP, SSGC and WAPDA that:  (i) the
existing Loan Agreement for ESL It and the Subsidiary Loan Agreements between
GOP and each of SSGC and WAPDA, respectively, would be modified to reflect the
addition of the supplemental loan to the investment component of the original
loan; and (ii) GOP would cause SSGC to prepare and submit to GOP and the Bank,
by December 31, 1991, a program and timetable, satisfactory to the Bank, to
reduce the average level of domestic consumers' arrears to no more than three
months; (iii> the allocation to SSGC and WAPDA in the existing Loan Agreement
of ESL II would be modified by increasing the amount in Category 2 from the
current US$125 million Xo US$153 million, to reflect the increased allocation
of "ITIA6 mil ion to SSGC and US$12 million to WAPDA; and (iv) the disbursement
of the proposed supplemental loan to the ESL II Loan, to be allocated to SSGC
and WAPDA, would be contingent on the fulfillment of the conditions precedent
to the release of the second tranche of the investment portion of ESL TI
(Loan 3107-PAK);
Recommendation
25.       I am satisfied that the proposed supplemental loan complies with the
Articles of Agreement of the Bank.  I recommend that the Executive Directors
approve the proposed supplemental loan.
