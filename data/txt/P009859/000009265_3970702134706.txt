MEMORANDUM AND RECOMMENDATION OF TEE PRESIDENT
OF THE INTERNATIONAL DEVELOPMENT ASSOCIATION
TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS
ON A PROPOSED CREDIT TO INDIA
FOR THE BIEAR PUBLIC TUBEWELL PROJECT
1.      The following report on a proposed development credit to India for
SDRi 59.5 N (US$68 K equivalent) is submitted for approval. The proposed
credit would be on standard IDA terms and help finance rehabilitation, mod-
ernization and expansion of public tubewells in the State of Bihar.  The
proceeds of the Credit would be channelled to the Government of Bihar (GOB)
in accordance with the Goverment of India's (GOI) standard terms and arran-
gements for the financing of State development projects. The exchange risk
would be borne by the Government of India.
2.      Background.  gihar is one of the most densely populated states in
India (426 personslkm ). It's annual per capita income of about Rs 1,330
(US$111 in current prices) is the lowest in India; about 50Z of the Stata's
population lives below the poverty level (about US$123 per capita in current
prices). The agricultural sector accounts for about 45Z of the State's
Domestic Product and employs about 80% of the working population. Agricul-
ture in the State is characterized by small-scale, subsistence farming,
mainly focused on cereal cultivation. Since most of the cultivable land is
already under cultivation, production can be expanded only by increasing
yields and cropping intensity.
3.      Rainfall is poorly distributed and varies greatly from season to
season, making irrigation necessary for crop production in the dry season,
and for minimizing risks in the wet season.  Bihar is well endowed with both
surface and groundwater resources, and thus, GOB accords high priority to
irrigatiou. GOB's Ltrategy is to focus on rehabilitation, modernization and
completion of existirng surface irrigation schemes and groundwater develop-
ment--both private through credit, and public.
4.      In the socio--economic context of Bihar-in areas with good land and
groundwater resources--public tubewell development can be an effective way to
provide irrigation to farmers who own or operate small, fragmented holdings
(about 75% of holdings in Bihar are less than one hectare). Furthermore,
unlike surface irrigation schemes, public tubewells can be sited selectively
and constructed quickly. Thus, with respect to public groundwater develop-
meat, GOB's investment strategy is to fully utilize existing public tubewells
and complement private groundwater development with a limited program of new
public tubewell construction directed at small farmers, who are unable to
finance private wells.
5.      Construction of public tubevells (PTWs) for irrigation began in 1937;
by 1983 about 5,300 PTWs had been constructed. However, owing to ineffective
management, insufficient funding, deteriorating power supply, and inadequate
Government support, by 1985 public tubevells were irrigating only about 8Z of
the potential command area created. To overcome the existing problems in
public groundwater development, the GOB has decided to: (i) rehabilitate and
modernize existing infrastructure and provide assured power supply so that
most PTWs in the State can perform at least to original design standards;
(ii) construct new tubewells with buried pipe distribution systems that can
be operated automatically and controlled by farmers at field outlet valves;
and (iii) change responsibility for PTW activities from a government-owned

-2-
corporation to a line organization within the Minor Irrigation Department
(MID) with proper staffing, adequate budget and an effective management
structure.
6.      Proiect Obiective.  The objective of the proposed project is to
increase agricultural production by improving and expanding the use of
Bihar's considerable groundwater potential. This wouldl be achieved by:
(i) introducing improved tubewell technology that eliminates the planning
and design problems inherent in Bihar's existing PTNs; (ii) undertaking a
phased program to rehabilitate and modernize most of Bihar's existing PTWs;
(iii) strengthening the institution responsible for PTW activities to ensure
that project works can be effectively and efficiently implemented, and
operated and maintained. The result will be increased agricultural produc-
tion, employment and incomes, especially for Bihar's small farmers.
7.      Project Description.  The tubewell irrigation systems to be
rehabilitated or constructed under the project would be distributed in 26 of
Northern Bihar's 38 administrative districts (see attached map). The
proposed project would comprise a seven-year program to support: Ci) con-
struction of about 500 new public tubewells; (ii) modernization of about
1,000 existing tubewells to the improved design standards of the new
tubewells; (iii) rehabilitation of about 3,700 existing tubewells; (iv)
construction of dedicated power lines to about 5,200 tubewells under the
project so that sufficient power is available to achieve planned irrigation
intensities; (v) improvements to management capability, through construction
of buildings, provision of vehicles and equipment, training, monitoring and
evaluation; and (vi) provision of technical services to undertake special
studies including management, socio-economic performance and cost recovery.
8.      The total cost of the project is estimated at US$99.7 X equivalent,
including taxes and duties of US$3.0 H. Foreign exchange costs are estimated
at US$14.2 H (14Z). A breakdown of costs and the financing plan are shown in
Schedule A. Amounts and methods of procurement are shown in Schedule B. A
timetable of key project processing events and the status of Bank Group
operations in India are given in Schedules C and D respectively. The Staff
Appraisal Report, No. 6034-IN, dated August 15J 1986 has been circulated
separately.
9.      Rationale for IDA Involvement.  Improved management and efficiency
of water delivery and use are fundamental objectives of Bank support to the
irrigation sector in India. In support of these strategic objectives, the
proposed project would:
(a)  Take advantage of lessons learnt and the technical principles proven
successful under the Uttar Pradesh Public Tubewells II Project
(Credit 1332-IN). These principles have resulted in irrigation
services provided by PTWs that are timely, reliable and predictable.
(b) Address serious organizational and management problems that have
hampered public groundwater development in Bihar in the past. A
series of major organizational changes, developed in cooperation with
GOB during preparation, would be introduced under the project.
(c) Support the review and formulation of improved cost recovery policies
and procedures for: Ci) setting the level of water charges; (ii)
billing for irrigation services; (iii) collecting bills on time; and
(iv) monitoring the financial performance of the newly established
Tubewell Wing of the MID.



-3-
IDA involvement in the project is crucial to ensure successful introduction
of improved tubevell technology and support effectively GOB's efforts to
continue and fully implement its planned institutional and cost recovery
policy reforms.
10.     Aareed Actions.  The Government has agreed to:  (1) provide an effec-
tive T&V agricultural extension service throughout the project districts
before project tubewells in a district are energized; (2) locate, plan,
design, construct, and operate and maintain the project works in accordance
with satisfactory standards and criteria; (3) maintain sound accounts with
timebound audits; (4) maintain a line government department responsible for
public groundwater development throughout the State that would be fully
staffed, funded and provided with facilities such that the project can be
implemented effectively and efficiently; (5) monitor and evaluate project
performance in terms of irrigation service and agricultural production; (6)
prepare regular progress reports with OM costs and cost recovery separately
identified; (7) review and formulate procedures to promptly collect water
charges with provision to take appropriate action to collect arrears; (8) under-
take studies to formulate an improved system of water charges appropriate to
the new technology to be introduced under the project; and (9) maintain water
charges to ensure that revenues would cover the average financial O&H costs
and a reasonable share of investment cost. In addition, although the project
is expected to improve the environment and reduce health hazards since
tubewell water is potable, GOB has agreed to take all measures necessary to
minimize the risk of water-related diseases in the project area.
11.     Justification.  The project would reduce farmers' risk by providing a
reliable irrigation service and thereby expand and stabilize agricultural
production. It would also lead to more efficient use of groundwater resour-
ces and power. The quantifiable benefits of full development would include
incremental annual foodgrain production of about 247,000 tons, valued at
about US$28 M per year. About 495,000 farm families comprising small and
marginal farmers would benefit directly from the project. The economic rates
of return (ERR) for the various project components range from 29Z to 42%, for
an overall project ERR of about 33%.
12.     Risks.  A potential risk is underutilization of the additional
irrigation capacity created by the project investments since the project is
directed at small farmers. In Bihar, low farmer response to irrigation is
usually a result of poor quality of the irrigation service. Under the
proposed project, this risk would be substantially reduced by providing
reliable, timely, and equitable irrigation service, and by improved system
management.
13.     Recommendation.  I am satisfied that the proposed credit would comply
with the Articles of Agreement of the Association and recommend that the
Executive Directors approve the proposed credit.

INDIA
I. THE ECONOMY
1.      A country economic report, "India:  Economic Situation and Development
Prospects" (6090-IN, dated May 9, 1986), was distributed to the Execucive
Directors on May 12, 1986. Country data sheets are attached as Annex I.
Background
2.      India is a large and diverse country with a population of about 780 mil-
lion (in mid-1986) and an average per capita income of about US$260.
Agriculture contirces to dominate the economy, accounting for about two-thirds
of employment. The steady increase in population, which continues at a rate of
2.OZ a year, has put increasing pressure on natural resources, in particular
cuLtivable land. By the mid-19609, nearly all productive land had been brought
under cultivation. Although irrigation continues to expand total cultivable
area, an increasing share of the labor force will have to be absorbed in non-
agricultural activities. Industrial development has not progressed rapidly
enough to provide employment opportunities for the growing labor force, or to
bring about a rapid economic transformation, with significantly higher produc-
tivity and income leveLs. As a result, the long-term growth of per capita
income has only averaged about 1.4% p.a. and close to one-half of India's
population continues to live below the poverty line. Alleviation of poverty
has been and remains thus at the core of India's development strategy.
3.      During the 1950s and 1960s, India's economic performance was charac-
terized by slow economic growth, moderate inflation and a sustainable externaL
position. GDP grew at about 3.5%, agriculture at 1.8Z and industry 4.8Z;
imports grew at 4.6% and exports at 5.8% a year. Although India was able to
reduce its dependence on foodgrain imports, from a peak of 14Z of total con-
sumption in 1966/67 to 4.5% in 1969/70,--mainly as a result of the Green
Revolution,--progress in poverty aLleviation was slow mainly, as population
continued to grow at 2.3% a year.
4.      The steep rise in international oil prices and accelerating global
inflation led co a sharp deterioration of India's terms of trade in the earLy
1970s, eroding ics capacity to import. In response, the Government incensified
its export promotion efforts and liberalized access to imported inputs. As a
result of these efforts, which were helped by the expansion of export markets.
particularly in the Kiddle East, export growth rose from an average of 2.2% a
year during the 1950s and 1960s to 7.3% in the 1970s. In turn, this expansion
of exports together with continued import substitution, particularly in food
grains and increased remittances, made it possible for India to attain a
surplus in its current account between 1976/77 and 1978/79. Thus India was
able to achieve, in a relatively short time, a comfortable foreign exchange
position, which was further enhanced by a steady increase in concessional aid.



-2-
Towards the end of the 1970s, India experienced a series of domestic and exter-
nal setbacks. Industrial production, pLagued by labor unrest and a shortage of
key inputs began to stagnate. One df the worst droughts in India's history
reduced agricultural output in 1979/80 by more than 15%. And, in the same
year, a second major increase in international oil prices more than doubled the
costs of India's oiL import bill. As a result, the current account showed
again a deficit and the remarkable price stability that the Indian economy had
enjoyed after 1975 came to an abrupt end. The Government responded by mounting
an economic adjustment program, which was eventually embodied in the Sixth Five
Year Plan (1980-85). The principaL objective of the program was to raise the
CDP growth rate from its historical Level of 3.6% to 5.22 per annum, through
alleviation of infrastructure and supply constraints, increased energy
independence, improved efficiency in resource use, promotion of exports and
efficient import substitution.
The Sixth Five Year Plan (1980-85)
5.      Overall the adjustment program has been successful, despite unfavorable
weather in several years, a continued worsening of the external environment and
adverse political developments. The developments of the Indian economy during
the Sixth Plan underscore the fundamental soundness of key policies and
programs, particularly in agriculture and energy, and attest to prudent and
skillful macro-economic management, which allowed production to grow while at
the same time keeping external borrowing well within acceptable levels of risk
and holding inflationary pressures in check. But the results during the Plan
period also highlight the disappointing performance of industry, continuing
shortfalls in electric power generation, rising public sector deficits and the
importance of regaining and sustaining momentum in export growth.
6.      During the Sixth Plan period, CDP grew by 5.4% per annum, 1/ well above
India's long-term growth rate of 3.6%. This increase in the average growth
rate reflects improvements in the performance of several key sectors. In
agriculture, the ambitious Plan targets with respect to foodgrain and oilseed
production were virtually attained, and the average growth of agriculturaL
value added of 4.5% a year exceeded the Plan target of 3.8%. The progress
achieved is an indication of the effectiveness of programs to expand
irrigation, strengthen research and extension and encourage the efficient use
of other agricultural inputs. At the same time, while achieving output gains,
agriculture appears to have become more resilient and resistent to poor
weather. During the Sixth Plan, India also succeeded in raising the output of
most raw materials. Domestic production of petroleum grew at 20%, well above
the planned rate of 12.1%, natural gas output at 19.2%, coal output at 6.9%,
and the production of cement and fertilizer at 10.6% and 8.1%, respectively.
1/ Actual CDP growth rate during the 1979/80-1984/85 period was 5.4% per
annum. However, this figure overstates the trend in recent years because
of the relatively Low base year (1979/80). The 4.5% CDP growth per annum
and 3.3% annual agricultural growth between 1980/81-19B3/84 (two "normal"
years) are more representative of che growth rates during the period.



-3-
The Sixth Plan also witnessed rapid growth in the services sector, in par-
ticular transport and communications.
7.      However, this dramatic improvement in performance did not occur evenly
throughout the economy. The industrial sector performed reLatively poorly,
growth averaged about 4.9% (1980/81-1984/85) a year--below the growth rates
achieved in the 1960s and 19709. Industrial growth has been inhibited by an
inadequate poLicy environment, coupled with a depressed domestic demand, power
shortages, and labor unrest. In addition, quantitative restrictions and high
tariffs on imports of inputs and capital goods have led to high inflated costs
and prices of industrial goods and manufactures, which has severely impaired
India's competitiveness in world markets. India's export performance under the
Sixth Plan reflects this. Instead of the targetted 9% a year, exports grew
only by 4.5%. The savings performance of the economy also deteriorated
somewhat. The national savings rate, which had risen steeply in the 1970s,
fell from 24.3% to about 23Z, and remained well below the rate required (24.5X)
to finance the investment program of the Sixth Plan. As a consequence, gross
investment grew only at 6.4% a year instead of the targetted 8.9%. The short-
fall in savings was most noticeable in the public sector, mainLy because of the
low profits or financial losses of public enterprises and lower than expected
tax revenues.
The Seventh Plan (1985-90)
8.      The Seventh Plan aims to build upon the accomplishments of the Sixth
Plan, which is by many regarded as a turning point in India's deveLopment
experience. To deal effectively with the dual challenges of alleviating per-
vasive poverty and expanding employment opportunities for a growing labor
force, the Seventh Plan will need to sustain the growth momentum attained under
the Sixth Plan. India's policy makers have become acutely aware in recent
years of the development constraints and in particular, the shortcomings of the
existing policy framework. The Seventh Plan portends to break new ground in
dealing with these constraints. More so than previous plans, it focusses on
the urgent need for greater efficiency, productivity and competitiveness in the
economy. In its various sectoral strategies the Plan adopts some new
approaches: in agriculture, the Plan gives top priority to the completion of
ongoing irrigation schemes; in industry, the Plan emphasizes improvements in
productivity, reductions in costs, and improved competitiveness; unlike pre-
vious plans it encourages a greater role of the private sector and promises to
provide the incentives needed to attract private industrial investment; in the
wake of the liberaLization measures taken under the Sixth Plan, which provided
entrepreneurs with greater flexibility in decision making, the Seventh PLan
envisages further changes in licensing policies and the pricing of commodities
which are subject to administered price controls; the Plan aims also for con-
tinued trade liberalization and places particular emphasis on the promotion of
export growth; the Plan also ensures that, even with accelerated growth, the
benefits of that growth are distributed proportionately: Sufficient
availability of food, which would have a dampening effect on food prices and
thus protect real incomes of the poor, as welL as additional empLoyment and
productivity increases which would raise per capita incomes, remain the top
piriorities of the Plan.



-4-
9.      Recent DeveLopments.  In its effort to implemenc the economic strategy
embodied in the Seventh Plan, the Government has provided, in the past year,
the critical details of its new economic policy framework through a series of
policy statements and committee reports. The latter included the Hussain
committee report and the import and export policy statement on trade policies;
the Narasimham committee report on shifting from physical to financial
controls; a report on the black economy; the Chakarvarty committee report on
monetary policies; and a statement on Long term fiscaL policy issues by the
Ministry of Finance. These reports deal with many of the major issues that
constrain economic growth in India. Attainment of the Seventh Plan targets
depends now to a large extent on the early implementation of their
recommendations. The Government's commitment to policy change is underscored
by its decision to introduce, in short succession, a series of new policy
initiatives in the industrial sector and with respect to trade and fiscal
policy.
10.     In addition to the measures implemented in 19B4/85 that aimed primarily
at improving industrial efficiency--including the opening up of the telecom-
munication equipment manufacturing industry to the private sector, new initia-
tives in the development of the electronics and computer industries, introduc-
tion of "broadbanding" into the automotive and machine tool industries--the
focus of the policy changes introduced by the Government was directed at fur-
ther reducing industrial controls: the number of industrial units coming under
the Monopolies and Restrictive Trade Policies act was reduced by 230 to 1505
units; the number of industries required to obtain licenses to install new
capacity or expand existing capacity was reduced substantially; the number of
industries benefitting from "broadbanding" was increased; and there was also a
series of improvements in procedures that reduced delays in obtaining clearan-
ces especially for large units and firms with foreign collaboration.
11.     Unlike the changes in industrial policy, many of which represented a
radical departure from the past, recent changes in trade policy, in particular
those with respect to export promotion failed to show the same strong
commitment. In its new Import-Export policy, the Government provided both
measures to liberalize imports including substantiaL import duty reductions and
export incentives. While the import liberalizing measures led to a surge in
imports, the export promotion measures --which included a simplification of the
administrative requirements for duty free imports, a widening of the
eligibility for advance licenses, and a reduction of export taxes and improve-
ments in foreign exchange forward cover facilities--had only a marginal impact
on the overall ease and profitability of exporting. This result was at least
in part due to several policy changes that undermined the export promotion
effort. The advance licensing system, for example, was tightened and a number
of facilities previously availabLe to large export houses were withdrawn or
restricted. A future strengthening of existing export promotion policies is
cLearly of high priority, if India is to meet its export targets under the
Seventh Plan.
12.     In parallel with the poLicy changes in the industrial and trade
sectors, the Government introduced significant changes in the tax policy. In



-5-
its 1985/86 budget the Government reduced income tax rates for individuaLs and
abolished the surcharge on income tax. Wealth taxes were also lowered which
together with lower income tax rates reduced the maximum marginal tax rate on
income from weaLth from over 110% to 70%. In the 1986/87 budget, further
concessions and simplification foreshadowed by the Long Term Fiscal Policy
statement were made. But perhaps the most far-reaching policy change in the
1986/87 budget was the introduction of the modified value added tax system for
37 of the 68 chapters of the excise tariff covering about 35% of its manufac-
tured production. Other potentially important policy changes included a new,
more smoothly phased, excise tax concession scheme for small scale industry and
simplification of the excise tariff schedule through the elimination of special
excise duties covering 132 items.
13.     The performance of the economy in the first year (1985/86) of the
Seventh Plan attests not only to the soundness of the Covernment's overaLl
approach, but also its determination to attain the ambitious Plan targets.
Economic growth during this past year was indeed robust. Real GDP is estimated
to have grown by almost 6% with industry growing somewhat faster than the
Seventh Plan's target of 6.6%. AgriculturaL GDP growth is expected to be
roughly on target with foodgrain production reaching about 150 million tons,
just a little below the peak production level of 1983/84. There was also a
marked improvement in the performance of the key infrastructural sectors.
During the first ten months of the fiscal year, electricity generation
increased by 8% on top of the 13Z increase achieved in the previous year,
mainly because of better utilization of thermal plant capacity. Coal produc-
tion grew more slowly than in the previous year, reflecting the Government's
efforts to reduce large pithead stocks. Railway freight traffic increased by
more than 9% during the first nine months as larger quantities of cement, coal,
petroleum and fertilizer were shipped. The strong performance of the
agriculture, energy, and transport sectors, combined with the new initiatives
in trade and fiscal policy have lead to a surge in industrial output and a
buoyant stock market.
14.     Inflation, in terms of the wholesale price index, rose by onLy 6%
during the first nine months of the fiscal year, compared to 7% during the same
period in 1984. High foodgrain stocks, sugar and edible oil imports, the
strict control of non-plan expenditure, and increases in the statutory
liquidity ratio of commercial banks were key factors restraining inflation.
The recent price increases of coal, fertilizer, grain and petroleum products
are not expected to significantly affect the inflation rate.
15.     However, with respect to one of the principal objectives of the Seventh
Plan, namely to accelerate export growth to a level that would aLlow India to
finance its imports, performance during the past year has been disappointing.
Preliminary data indicate a 1X decline in the US dollar value of non-pecroLeum
exports and a 21% increase in imports during the first half of the fiscal year
over the same period in 1984/85. Most of the increase in imports was due co a
bunching of bulk imports by canalizing agencies in the first two quarters of
the year to take advantage of declining commodity prices. During the third
quarter, import growth subsided significantly and there was also a discernible
improvement in exports. Despite the expected increase in the trade deficit for



-6-
the year as a whole, however, reserves are expected to increase by 600 million
US dollars. This is in part due to a moderate increase in worker's
remittances, tourism receipts and a surge in non-resident deposics which amount
now to almost US$1.4 billion.
16.     Development Prospects and Policies.  Attaining the objectives of the
Seventh Plan in the years ahead will place heavy demands on policy adjustment
and entail major challenges. India wilL need to: (a) maintain the recent
higher rate of expansion of agriculturaL production; (b) accelerate industrial
production and export growth through policy changes which enhance competition
and efficiency; (c) expand supply capacities in the economy by improving basic
infrastructure services and the availability of energy; (d) improve the
efficiency with which resources are used, including the existing and new capi-
tal stock in infrastructure and industry; and (e) further improve the already
high resource mobilization effort.
17.     Agriculture.  Despite an impressive performance under the Sixth Plan,
Indian agriculture faces many challenges in the second half of the decade. As
possibilities for extending culcivated acreage shrink, agricultural growth wilt
depend on finding new ways of increasing the productivity of land through
further development of irrigation, better water management, more intensive use
of new technology, efficient delivery of inputs and services, and appropriate
pricing policies. High priority must be given to the expansion of the
country's irrigable area through completion of ongoing irrigation projects, as
well as selective investment in new undertakings. Besides creating new irriga-
tion potential, the efficiency of irrigated farming will have to be enhanced
through the improvement of water management practices in existing irrigation
systems. Greater emphasis should also be given to obtaining higher yields
under rainfed and dryland farming conditions. Finally, even greater efforts
must be made to build and strengthen institutions to ensure the efficient
delivery of agricultural services, input supplies, credit and technology.
18.     Industry and Trade.   Prospects for raising India's CDP growth rate
will, to a large extent, depend on more rapid industrial production and export
growth. A key requirement will be greater competitive pressure on industry
than has been the case in the past. The size and domestic orientation of the
Indian economy make it necessary that this competitive pressure come mainLy
from within the domestic economy. An important complemenc, however, will be
greater exposure to foreign trade to stimulate domestic competition as weLl as
to induce technological innovation and modernization.
19.     To increase domestic competition, domestic policies will need to allow
freer entry and exit of firms in the industrial sector and greater reLiance on
market price signals. As indicated above the Government has taken various
initiatives in the above directions during the past several years. These
changes have begun to produce a marked favorable impact on the investment
climate, private corporate profitability and the growth of the stock market.
All these suggest that the manufacturing sector is beginning to respond to the
new policy changes in industry. However, the policy changes initiated to date
only begin the long process of adjusting the trade and industrial policy
environment under which industry operates. Much more remains to be done to



4
-7-
transform the poLicy environment from one based on a system of extensive direct
physical controls to one in which competitive pressures both within the country
and abroad induce the improvements in productivity and technology upgrading
which are required by Indian industry for accelerated investment, production
and export growth. As indicated above, the Government has introduced a number
of measures to promote exports. Up to now these changes have had Little impact
on export growth. If further efforts faiL to bring the export growth rate
closer to the 7Z target of the Seventh Plan, the prospects for sustaining the
import liberaLization effort and in turn the prospects for accelerating
industrial and overall CDP growth will be seriousLy affected. Thus, there
remains an urgent need for the Government to (a) intensify its efforts in
improving direct export incentives and to provide greater access to imported
inputs and capital goods through continued import liberalization; (b) review
tariffs, eliminating anomaLies and lowering their overall level; and (c) modify
trade poLicies in such a way that the net impact of incentives is more neutral
between exports and import substitution.
20.     Infrastructure Sectors.  Investments in these sectors currently con-
stitute about one-third of total investment in India, and the efficiency with
which these investments are managed has an important bearing on the efficiency
of total investment and the growth rate of the entire economy. There is sub-
stantial evidence that better planning and management of public investments in
power, coal, railways and irrigation could improve returns and Lower the cur-
rent capital-output ratios. For example, more efficient use of investment
could be achieved by better water management in irrigation projects, improved
load factors in thermal power generation, better capacity utilization in the
fertilizer industry and improved efficiency in railway transport.
21.     Resource MobiLization.  India's gross national savings rate (22.6% in
1980-85) is already high for country at India's level of income. The Seventh
Plan calls for a public sector outlay of 1,800 billion rupees. Out of this
total, 42% is to be financed from the public sector's own resources, compared
to the 37% level during the Sixth Plan period. Financing of the Plan--while
holding foreign savings as a share of GDP at prudent levels--will require,
apart from restraint in current expenditures (including a reduction in the
rapidly growing food and fertilizer subsidies), some further increase in the
aggregate savings rate especially in public savings.l/ Economically efficient
pricing policies in public enterprises, supported by improvements in their
operational efficiency, would be the preferred means for increasing public
resource mobilization.
1/ As indicated above, the Government has introduced significant changes
in its tax policy, incLuding a reduction of income tax rates for
individuals and the introduction of a modified value added tax system.
While it is too earLy to judge the longer term impact of these changes,
it is encouraging that the Central Government's tax receipts during 1g85/86
were running well ahead of last year and of the budget estimates.

22.     Balance of Payments.  A policy of sustained CDP growth of 5% per annum
wilL need to be complemented by measures which assure a viable balance of
payments position. Acceleration of industrial growth will lead to a substan-
tial increase in import requirements, even after allowing for continued import
substitution of key bulk commodity items. Bank staff estimates place the
export volume growth necessary to support these growing import requirements
without excessive increases in external borrowing at about 7% a year over the
Seventh Plan period. Prospects for India to attain the needed higher export
growth rates wiLl depend heavily on changes in domestic policy to improve the
profitability of exports.
23.     Even assuming favorable export performance, Endia will continue to need
substantial external capital (Lows to augment its own resources for the
foreseeable future. Even with 8% export growth, the 5% GDP growth implies an
increase in gross capital inflows from US$17.5 billion to US$23.5 billion
between the Sixth. and Seventh Plan periods. In the past, the bulk of this
financing was provided in the form of official development assistance. In more
recent years the availability of concessional assistance to India has declined.
Total bilateral grants and concessional loans declined from a level of about
US$1.3 billion per annum over the years 1979/80-1981/82 to US$1.l billion in
1984/85. Moreover, there was a Large deterioration in the terms of aid from
multilateraL sources. For example, while total lending from the Bank Group
continued to increase in nominal terms, the grant element declined from 71% to
41% as new commitments of IDA declined from a peak of $1,535 million in FY80 to
$673 million in FY85 and about $600 million in FY86.
24.     In the event that official development assistance does not increase
significantly from recent levels, nearly the full additional financing required
would have to be provided from additional non-concessional borrowing from
official and commercial sources. This will increase India's debt service ratio
from the present leveL of 15.5% to 21.6% by 1989/90. Provided India can in
fact, expand export earnings along the lines described earlier, the country
should be able to raise the projected amounts.
25.     In the short term, a relatively large level of external borrowing,
including an increased emphasis on commercial borrowing, wiLl be necessary to
cope with the balance of payments consequences oE the growth strategy described
earlier. Although India is currently in a position to increase borrowing on
commercial terms from the very low levels of the past, there are, of course,
limits beyond which India will choose to sacrifice growth objectives rather
than accept debt on unfavorable or unmanageabLe terms. While therefore a
greater volume of both official concessional and non-concessionaL assistance
is warranted, concessional assistance, in particular, will be invaluable in
moderating the build-up in India's debt service burden. Apart from the quan-
titative arguments for concessional aid, there remains the imperative to assisc
India in addressing the problems of pervasive poverty. While India is now
better pLaced than other poor countries to tackle its deveLopment problems, the
mobilization of additionaL resources to address poverty problems is heavily
constrained. ConcessionaL assistance can play on important roLe in relieving
this constraint.

PART I1 - BANK GROUP OPERATIONS IN INDIA
26.     Since 1949, the Bank Croup has made 93 loans and 183 deveLopment
credits to India totalling US$8,735 million and US$13,809 million (both net
of cancellations), respectively. Of these amounts, US$1,633 miLlion has been
repaid, and US$8,743 million was sciLl undisbursed as of March 31, 1986. Bank
Group disbursements to India in the current fiscal year through March 31, 1986
totalled US$1,003 million, representing an increase of about 28 percent over
the same period last year. Annex II contains a summary statement of disburse-
ments as of March 31, 1986.
27.     Since 1959, IFC has made 36 commitments in India totalling
US$310 million, of which a total of US$186 million has been repaid, sold,
terminated or cancelled. Of the balance of US$124 million, US$118 million
represents loans and US$6 miLlion equity. A summary statement of rFC disburse-
ments as of March 31, 1986, is also included in Annex II (page 5).
28.     The thrust of Bank Group assistance to India has been consistent with
the country's development objectives in its support of agriculture, energy and
infrastructure. Of particular importance have been investments in irrigation,
extension and on-farm development designed to increase agricultural
productivity, and efforts to improve the availability of basic agricultural
inputs to farmers through credit, fertilizer, marketing, storage, and seed
projects. Major elements of the lending program have also been directed at
helping to meet the energy needs of the economy while curbing the growth of oil
imports, and to ease the infrastructure bottlenecks which have hampered
economic growth in India, particularly through power generation and
distribution, and railways and telecommunications projects. The Bank Group has
also provided financing for a broad range of medium- and small-scale industrial
enterprises, primarily in the private sector, through its support of develop-
ment finance institutions. Recognizing the importance of improving the ability
to satisfy the essential needs of urban and rural populations, the Bank Group
has supported nutrition and family planning programs, a rural roads project, as
well as water supply and sewerage and other urban infrastructure projects.
29.     This pattern of assistance remains highly relevant, and consonant with
Government priorities, as reflected in the the Seventh Plan. First, high
priority will continue to be given to GOI's agricultural program. While India
has made significant progress in agriculture, productivity growth will have to
be sustained to improve the balance between food demand and supply and to
contribute to poverty alleviation and employment. Thus, the Bank Group will
continue to support irrigation, fertilizer production and distribution, and
agricultural extension, research and credit. Second, alongside GOI's efforts
in promoting greater efficiency and Easter development of the industrial
sector, increased assistance will be provided for industriaL development.
Third, in line with the stress which the Seventh Plan gives to the expansion
and more efficient use of basic infrastructure capacity and to the deveLopment
of India's indigenous hydrocarbon resources, the Bank Group will continue to
provide substantiaL support to the development of the energy, transport and
telecommunications sectors to alleviate critical shortages which constrain
output in both the agriculturaL and industrial sectors. Fourth, support of



-10-
urban development and other GOI basic social services programs for the poor
will also continue in light of the growth in population which, despite succes-
ses in lowering birth and death rates, still increases by about 16 miLlion each
year.
30.     The need for a substantiaL net tran3fer of external resources in sup-
port of the development of India's economy has been a recurrent theme of Bank
economic reports and of the discussions within the rndia Consortium. Thanks in
part to the response of the aid community, India successfully adjusted to the
changed world price situation of the mid-1970s. However, India continues to
require a substantial level of foreign assistance both to offset the overall
deterioration in the world trade environment, and to sustain the relativeLy
higher investment and growth rates achieved during the Sixth Plan period. As
in the past, Bank Group assistance for projects in India should aim to incLude
the financing of local expenditures. India imports relatively few capital
goods because of the capacity and competiti.eness of the domestic capital goods
industry. Consequently, the foreign exchange component tends to be small in
most projects. This is particularly the case in such high-priority sectors as
agriculture and irrigation.
31.     India's poverty and needs are such that whenever possible, external
capital requirements should be provided on concessional terms. Accordingly,
the bulk of the Bank Group assistance to India in the past was provided from
IDA. However, IDA lending to India is declining from a peak of US$1.5 billion
in FY80, mostly due Lo funding constraints related to IDA. The amount of IDA
funds available to India is likeLy to remain small in relation to India's needs
for external support. Thus, this requirement for additional assistance will
have to be met, in part, through larger Bank lending. Civen its development
prospects and policies, India is judged creditworthy for Bank lending to sup-
plement IDA assistance. A continuation of efforts already underway to achieve
growth in productive capacity, trade expansion, higher levels of savings,
foodgrains self-sufficiency and a reduction in the rate of population growth
should result in continued economic growth and improvement in the balance of
payments. India's debt service ratio is estimated at about 15.2% in 1984/85.
This ratio is projected to rise to around 202 by 1989/90, mainly due to the
hardening structure of India's debt; and to increase slightly over this level
through the mid-1990's. Although the projected debt service ratios are con-
siderably above historical levels, they are still manageable and will not
adversely affect India's creditworthiness.
32.     Of the external assistance received by India, the proportion con-
tributed by the Bank Group has grown significantly. In 1970/71. the Bank Group
accounted for 22% of total commitments, 11% of gross disbursements, and 10% of
net disbursements as compared with 68X, 38% and 47Z, respectiveLy, in 1984185.
In 1984/85, about 26.3% of India's total debt service payments were to the Bank
Group. On March 31, 1985, India's outstanding and disbursed external public
debt was estimated to be about US$26.5 billion, oE which the Bank Group's share
was US$11.1 billion or 42% (IDA's US$8.9 billion and IBRD's US$2.2 billion).
As of March 31, 1986 outstanding loans and credits to India held by the Bank
totalled US$20,911 million, of which US$8,743 million remain to be disbursed,
leaving a net amount outstanding of US$12,168 million.
