1. Project Context, Development Objectives and Design

Project Context.

Post-Conflict Environment. After close to 40 years of civil war between northern and
southern Sudan the two parties signed the Comprehensive Peace Agreement (CPA) on
January 9, 2005. The CPA defined the roles and responsibilities of the Government of
National Unity (GoNU) in the north and the Government of Southern Sudan (GSS) in the
south for an Interim Period of six years. Before the end of the Interim Period a
referendum would be held in Southern Sudan to decide if the people in the south wanted
to be independent from the rest of Sudan. They chose independence. The Republic of
Sudan and the Republic of South Sudan became independent states on July 9, 2011.

The Joint Assessment Mission (JAM). The joint mission by the GoNU and the GSS
was mandated by the CPA and prepared a “Framework for Sustained Peace,
Development and Poverty Eradication”. The mission report concluded, amongst other
things, that Sudan’s poor health outcomes were associated with a health care system that
is significantly under-funded, unbalanced and inefficient. Preliminary findings from a
2003 health infrastructure survey showed that, overall, 36 percent of health facilities were
not fully functioning in North Sudan. The coverage of the primary health care (PHC)
network was severely constrained by lack of staff and funds for recurrent expenditure,
and by a range of management problems including fragmentation and an inadequate
information system. The infrastructure network was large overall, but population-to-
facility ratios – around 100,000 per rural hospital and 35,000 per health center – were
high. There were very large urban-rural and regional disparities in the availability of
services. There was a re-emergence of polio cases in Darfur in 2004, just as Sudan was
on the verge of being declared polio-free. This illustrated the inadequacy of the PHC
system, including low routine immunization coverage, and the threats facing neighboring
countries as well as Sudan, underscoring the need for a general expansion and upgrading
of the health sector. 1

For the health sector the JAM report’s objective by the end of the six-year Interim Period
specified in the CPA in 2011 was to increase coverage of basic health services in Sudan
from an estimated 45 percent to 60 percent of the population.

Government Health Strategy. The GoNU vision for the health sector was expressed in
the Federal Ministry of Health (GMoH) 25-year Strategy. The main objective was to
achieve the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs), contribute to poverty reduction,
and improve equity across and within states, and among vulnerable groups. 2 The JAM

annually in the next two to three years in order to achieve significant progress towards
the MDGs for all Sudan

1.1 Health Sector Context at Appraisal

The Decentralized Health System Development Project (DHSDP) was proposed in the
JAM as an important investment. Although health indicators in Sudan in 2006 were
often better than Sub-Saharan Africa averages, this masked significant urban-rural and
regional disparities caused by conflict, internal displacement, and chronic poverty. For
example, while there were about 22 physicians per 100,000 population overall in Sudan,
the ratios were considerably lower in poorer and conflict-affected states. The ratio
was 13 in Red Sea, 10 in Blue Nile, 5 in Kassala, and 4 in South Kordofan. Similar
patterns existed for health outcomes. The 1999 Safe Motherhood Survey found that
average under-five mortality was 104 per 1,000 in the then Northern Sudan, compared to
an estimate of 162 for Sub-Saharan Africa as a whole. However, under-five mortality in
this project’s target states of South Kordofan (147), Kassala (148), Red Sea (165), and
Blue Nile (172) was significantly higher than the country average. Nationally maternal
mortality averaged about 600 per 100,000 births in 2006, but ranged between 1,400 in
Kassala and 170 in Red Sea state. Along with disparities among health indicators
between states, there were also substantial inequalities in the availability of health
services within states. Many important health indicators in localities in the target states
for this project were lower than state averages because the poor and the isolated in those
localities had almost no access to effective PHC.

A social and gender assessment in the target states conducted as part of project
preparation, concluded that even in situations where adequate primary health services
existed, there were major barriers to access facing women, vulnerable groups and the
poor. In the four target states, the cost of service fees and drugs, as well as shortages of
drugs in many rural hospitals and basic health units, prevented many households from
accessing health care. In many cases, women have little say over the use of a family‘s
financial resources, and consequently little control over health-seeking behavior for
themselves and their children. Cultural norms and domestic responsibilities result in
women spending much of their day carrying heavy loads of firewood, water, and
foodstuffs long distances, creating both related health concerns, as well as limiting
opportunities for seeking health care. These norms also dictate home birthing which,
combined with inadequate access to health centers and emergency obstetric care (EOC),
and poor post natal care result in high maternal and new-born mortality. These
weaknesses in access of large numbers of people in Sudan to PHC provided the core
rationale for the project.

The principle of a decentralized health system was already national policy. While the
federal Government was gradually increasing its fiscal transfers to the states, primary
health care at the state level was still focused predominantly on urban areas. However,




                                              2
Sudan’s Interim Constitution (2005) made a commitment to provide free emergency and
basic health services to all Sudanese. This project supported the pursuit of this goal. 3

Rationale for MDTF Financing. The CPA had specified that a Multi-Donor Trust
Fund-National (MDTF-NS) focus on recovery and development of conflict-affected
regions, particularly the Three Areas (Blue Nile, South Kordofan and Abyei), as well as
the least-developed regions in North Sudan. In light of the growing Government
revenues from the oil industry, the project was intended to lay the institutional and
technical groundwork for sustainable financing, reform and development of the
decentralized health care system. In accordance with agreements when the MDTF-NS
was established projects were financed jointly by the GoNU (two-thirds of the cost) and
the MDTF-NS (one-third of the cost).

1.2 Original Project Development Objectives (PDO) and Key Indicators

The Final Project Proposal (FPP) proposed a three phase project with the following
objective and sources of financing shown in Table 1 below.

To “improve access to basic health services by conflict-affected and underserved
populations in four target states while establishing the basis for reform, sustainable
financing, and development of the decentralized health system”. 4

1.3 Revised PDO (as approved by original approving authority) and Key Indicators,
and reasons/justification.


3
  Sudan’s Federal Government is responsible for policy and vertical public health programs, and overall
monitoring and evaluation of health system performance, as well as for tertiary hospital services. The
states are responsible for first-referral hospital services and, through the formal sub-divisions in the states
called localities which are typically responsible for the provision of services such as water supply, power,
basic education and basic health care) for primary health services. The terms primary health care (PHC)
and basic health care services are used interchangeably and are understood to encompass primary
preventive and curative services as well as first-referral services, usually provided by district/rural hospitals.

The PDO was not revised. However, two of the project’s three key outcomes indicators
were revised during project’s first restructuring to make them more concise. Other
indicators were dropped because they were not measurable. The revisions as well as the
reasons for the changes are shown in Table 2. Actions taken at the first restructuring
with respect to the three key performance indicators were as follows:

       •   The first original key indicator which directly addressed the main project
           objective ("access to PHC") was not changed and remained unchanged throughout
           the project’s implementation

       •   The second original key indicator ("percent of patients who do not receive health
           care due to financial barriers in target areas") was not measurable and replaced
           ("percent of pregnant women who attended at least one antenatal care
           consultation) which was measurable and consistent with the original key indicator

       •   The third original key indicator ("skilled birth attendance in target areas") was not
           concise and hence there were no data for its measurement; it was therefore
           modified ("births attended by skilled health staff") to make it concise and
           consistent with the original key indicator

The intent of changes to the second and third indicators was to make them measurable
and concise while maintaining their focus on the measurement of improvements to
reproductive health.

The Data Sheet contains information on the targets for the indicators and the
achievements towards those targets at the time the project closed.

1.4 Main Beneficiaries

The FPP stated that the project will provide support to the poor, underserved and conflict-
affected states of South Kordofan, Blue Nile, Kassala, and Red Sea which at appraisal
had a total population of approximately 5.1 million where infant mortality averaged 101
per 1,000 births, under–five mortality was 154 per 1,000 births, and maternal mortality
averaged 524 per 10,000 births. All of these mortality rates were higher than national
averages. The project activities were initially targeted at 19 localities where the total
population was about 1.1 million, although three training centers for midwives in North
Kordofan were added towards the end of the project as well as a hospital in a peri urban
rural locality in Port Sudan in Red Sea State. 5 While pregnant women and new-born
children were the main beneficiaries, the PHC systems in target localities benefited
resulting in improved access to PHC for numerous poor households in these localities.




5
    These additions brought the number of localities after the Fourth Restructuring to 21 at the project’s close

1.5 Original Components 6

Component 1. Expand access to primary health care services by underserved
populations (FPP estimate US$19.00 million; actual US$8.30 million). This component
was directly relevant to the first part of the PDO, namely “improve access to basic health
services by conflict-affected and underserved populations in four target states”.

Sub-component 1.1. Improvement in the quality of existing primary health care services
in under-served areas. This involved an integrated package of support to targeted health
services to be implemented by existing government systems, with technical support from
a dedicated government team.

Sub-component 1.2. Expansion of coverage of primary health care services and high-
impact interventions in un-served areas. This Sub-component supported expansion of
basic health services to improve coverage of conflict-affected and un-served areas using
the following strategies.
i)     In areas with no existing government services, the project financed mobile and
       temporary clinics managed and supplied by the State MoHs and staffed by
       government health workers reallocated from better-served areas and States.
ii)    Another strategy for areas with no government health services was to finance
       private for-profit and non-profit firms and organizations to provide services on a
       contractual basis such as in the Blue Nile
iii)   Prioritizing populations with little or no access to facility-based health services, the
       project supported the provision of high-impact health interventions directly to
       communities and households, with particular focus on reducing barriers to
       accessing care for women and vulnerable groups.

Sub-component 1.3. Pilot experiences to reduce barriers to access to primary health
care services. The objective of this Sub-component was to improve the knowledge and
experience of the health authorities with possible strategies and interventions to reduce
barriers to access to PHC services, particularly by women, vulnerable groups and the
poor in general.

Planned pilots at appraisal were to:
i)     Evaluate the implementation, effect on service utilization, and financial feasibility
       of subsidies PHC services with a large impact on morbidity and mortality.
ii)    Measure the cost and impact on service utilization of expanding health insurance
       coverage to conflict-affected and underserved groups.

project.


                                                    6
iii)   Assess the effect on health service utilization by women of interventions designed
       to address gender-related barriers to access.

Component 2. Establish the basis for reform and development of the decentralized
health system. (FPP estimate US$50.4 million; actual US$9.94 million) This component
was directly relevant to the second part of the PDO, namely “establishing the basis for
reform, sustainable financing, and development of the decentralized health system”.
However it was also relevant to the first objective because this component financed most
of the project’s construction and rehabilitation activity

Sub-component 2.1. Capacity-building and policy development. The objective was to
lay the groundwork for reform and development of the decentralized health system
through technical assistance and studies on priority systemic issues as well as capacity-
building in selected areas.

Studies planned at appraisal were:

i) Health care financing. The project supported technical assistance to provide a
     stronger information based on current health financing in Sudan, including household
     out-of-pocket expenditures, National Health Accounts (NHA), and support for the
     development of a reform strategy to improve financing of basic health services under
     the fiscal federal system in the context of the Fiscal and Financial Allocation and
     Monitoring Commission (FFAMC). This work also included an in-depth study of the
     National Health Insurance Fund (NHIF).
ii) Access to pharmaceuticals. Technical assistance and studies examined availability
     and barriers to access to affordable medication in order to inform the ongoing
     development and expansion of the Revolving Drug Fund system.
iii) Health planning, budgeting and management by target State and Locality health
     administrations. Capacity-building and training would focus on the four target State
     MoHs. It was to include institutional assessments to provide recommendations on
     organizational reform and development, and technical assistance and training in
     planning, budgeting, management and supervision.
iv) Monitoring and evaluation. Capacity building for monitoring and evaluation
     functions for all three levels of government, including strengthening health
     management information systems (HMIS) and the capacity of administrators to
     effectively analyze and use data. Technical assistance at the federal and four target
     state levels.

Sub-component 2.2. Development of primary health care human resources. This sub-
component provided support to implementation of the FMoH human resources for health
(HRH) strategy in the four target states, established the basis for improvements in the
production, quality, deployment and retention of the PHC workforce. Of particular
priority were medical technicians, nurses and midwives.

The project supported the following:



                                             7
i) National human resources for health (HRH) strategy development. Technical
     assistance for the development of sector-wide HRH strategies and policies, with a
     focus on PHC cadres.
ii) State PHC human resource development strategies. Technical assistance to the State
     MoHs for assessment of HRH needs in the four target states, with a focus on PHC
     workers.
iii) Curriculum review and instructor in-service training. Technical assistance to review
     PHC training programs and curricula which formed the basis for refresher training for
     instructors.
iv) Rationalization and investment in training schools and equipment. In line with State-
     level HRH strategies, nursing and midwifery schools upgraded through renovation
     and equipment which was accompanied by rationalization of existing training
     institutions.

Sub-component 2.3. Investment in primary health care infrastructure and equipment.
Upgrading and expansion of the PHC infrastructure in the four target states, focusing on
weakest health facilities. PHC facilities included health centers and rural hospitals
providing first-referral services, notably emergency obstetric care. The first phase of
investment was detailed planning, including assessment of the physical and functional
status of PHC facilities, equipment needs, geographical distribution, identification of
priorities for rehabilitation, and construction work, including the initiation of architectural
studies. It was anticipated that the bulk of rehabilitation and construction would be
carried out in phases two and three of the project. There were, however, no second and
third phases.

Sub-component 2.4. Project implementation. Financed the personnel and resources
necessary to manage the project and coordinate the Project Implementation Units (PIUs)
at the federal and state levels.

1.6 Revised Components

The project was restructured four times which twice involved additional financing.
Annex Table 2A provides details of the first and fourth restructuring when project
changes involved more than an extension of the closing date as in the second and third
restructuring.

   (a) First Restructuring and Additional Financing. This was approved by the
       Oversight Committee of the MDTF-NS on May 15, 2009. The actions were
       stimulated by a concern about the project’s slow progress due to the substantial
       shortfall in releases of the Government’s funding commitments, the difficulties
       posed by an overly ambitious project, and the opportunity to support the
       Government’s “Road Map for Reducing Maternal Mortality and New Born




                                              8
        Mortality in Sudan”, 2009. 7 The main features of this restructuring which
        included revision of some activities, components and indicators were as follows:

        i) Sharpening the project’s focus on child under five and reproductive health
           services. The trade-off for this focus was to drop a number of activities
           related to specific diseases and a reduced rehabilitation and construction
           program for health and training centers at the state and locality levels.
           However, the objective of improving access to PHC services was not
           abandoned. Some indicators were dropped because they were not measurable
           and substituted or modified to measure outcomes more precisely (see Table 2).

        ii) Component 1 (“Expand Access to Primary Health Care Services), $2.5 million of
            additional financing to targeted health facilities for the procurement of medical
            supplies, operational costs and pharmaceuticals, as well as midwifery kits and
            supplies for midwives, and refresher training for PHC workers and midwives.
        iii) Component 2 (“Establish Basis for Reform and Development of the Health
             System”), $3.5 million of additional financing to system investments to improve
             maternal and neonatal health care services. This included improving antenatal,
             delivery and referral services provided by village midwives (VMWs) based on
             pre-service training, applying the Government’s newly-developed curriculum for
             skilled birth attendants, technical support and supervision, and piloting of
             performance-based incentives replaced the piloting to reduce barriers to access to
             PHC. Investment in PHC training was scaled down and the number of health
             facilities to be rehabilitated and equipped was limited to civil works and
             equipment already procured. Technical assistance and studies continued.
        iv) A project results framework was prepared, and key indicators and targets reflected
            the change in the project’s focus (albeit still aimed at the PDO of improving
            access to basic health services), particularly in Component 1.
        v) The geographic focus of Component 1, as well as the infrastructure and
           equipment investments of Component 2, would be more narrowly directed to 58
           targeted health facilities and their catchment populations totaling approximately
           one million in underserved parts of 19 poor rural localities in four target states.
        vi) The closing date was changed to June 30, 2011.

    (b) Second Restructuring. Approved on June 9, 2011, the purpose was to extend the
        closing date to June 30, 2012 due to the delayed implementation in Blue Nile and
        South Kordofan on account of the civil conflict.

   (c) Third Restructuring. Approved on June 21, 2012, to extend the closing date to
       December 30, 2012, it provided time to prepare the Fourth Restructuring and
       Additional Financing.
   (d) Fourth Restructuring and Additional Financing. This was approved on
       December 14, 2012. The purpose was to:

       (i) Consolidate the achievements with VMW training, and expand to a new target
       state (North Kordofan), that had received IDPs from Blue Nile and South Kordofan,
       and add the rehabilitation of a peri urban hospital in Rural Port Sudan.
       (ii) Access by pregnant women to trained village midwives was expanded, all
       midwives were provided with a package of incentives, and continuous supervision
       and support to midwives was started based on institutional arrangements already
       introduced to improve their performance. The rehabilitation of midwifery schools at
       El Obeid, El Nuhud and Um Ruwaba was added.
       (iii) The results matrix was changed by increasing the targets for two indicators,
       namely “percentage births attended by skilled health staff” was increased from 30 to
       55 percent, and the “number of health staff (including midwives) receiving training”
       was increased from 1,000 to 3,000.
       (iv) The project’s components and sub-components were also formally amended
       (“consolidated”) as shown Annex 1. The closing date was extended to June 30, 2013.
The restructuring increased funding by the MDTF-NS in Phase 1 of the project from $6
million to $12 million (after the first restructuring) and to $14 million (after the fourth
restructuring). Government contributions were reduced from $13 million in Phase 1 to
$4.24 million. The Government stated, however, that it maintained its overall financial
support through regular budget support for many of the project’s activities. Additional
details of the project’s restructurings are provided in Annex Table 2A.

1.7 Other significant changes

Following the re-emergence of conflict in 2011/2012 the project could not implement
most activities in Blue Nile and South Kordofan States. While the problems in most of
Blue Nile subsided allowing the resumption of project activities in 2012, South Kordofan
remained largely inaccessible to the project until the project closed.

2. Key Factors Affecting Implementation and Outcomes

2.1 Project Preparation, Design and Quality at Entry

Project Preparation. As noted above, the concept for this project was based on a
detailed examination of Sudan’s health sector in the JAM. The project’s concept paper
was reviewed in February 2006. The FPP submitted to the Oversight Committee of the
MDTF-NS for funding was developed in consultation with sector partners, namely the
Health Thematic Group among development partners in Sudan led by the FMoH, which
included MDTF-NS donors, UN agencies, the World Bank, and non-governmental health

                                             10
sector partners. Project preparation by the Government was based on the best
information available on the health sector and its needs. Appraisal included extensive
planning and consultation in each of the target states, involving Federal, State and local
authorities, including representatives of conflict-affected and underserved populations in
the target states, and other sector stakeholders such as non-governmental and community-
based organizations. WHO provided assistance to the project’s preparation. DHSDP was
in line with MDTF-NS objectives and supported by the Oversight Committee. In
addition the Federal and State governments had strong ownership of the project and were
committed to its implementation and success. The Oversight Committee approved the
FPP on October, 30 2006.

Design. The project’s first objective of improving access to PHC was clear. Evidence
showed that access to PHC needed to improve, but the expected extent of improved
access resulting from this project was not specified. The second objective was not clear
because it depended on establishing a basis for progress on various benchmarks; this
basis was not defined.

A signature and successful feature of the project’s design was that State Ministries of
Health (SMoHs) were empowered to be responsible for the day to day management and
implementation of the project. They were supported by relatively small PIUs in each
state working closely with state health authorities at all levels providing oversight and
facilitation as well as advice on fiduciary issues. 8 The FMoH, through its departments,
provided the overall management and policy direction for the project supported by a
small Federal PIU responsible for fiduciary matters such as the procurement at the federal
level and the management of the special project accounts.

The project’s design at appraisal was influenced by the range of problems facing the
health sector in target states which experienced a considerable decline in the quality of
health services during the civil war. Consequently the project’s original scope was overly
ambitious considering the relatively small size of the total project cost and the very short
time (4-5 years) to complete three phases in a country where PHC institutions were weak
and fiscal decentralization had barely started. Its scope was trimmed during the first
restructuring in May 2009 following lengthy discussions within the Bank and with the
Government which started in 2008 The second and third phases of DHSDP were
abandoned as separate projects although some of their proposed activities were
implemented. 9 Despite the project’s restructuring there was no change in its basic design
of empowering Federal and State MoHs with the responsibility for improving access to
PHC services.




8
 The exception was South Kordofan which had two PIUs, one in the north and the other in former SPLA
areas in the south.

9
    The Oversight Committee abandoned all phases for MDTF-financed projects in 2008.


                                                 11
Risks. This was an ambitious project with many risks. The risks perceived at appraisal
included the inherent institutional risks such as the project’s dependence on the FMoH
and the SMoHs, their ownership of the project, the competence of FPIU and SPIU staff,
the adequacy of financial reporting, and the timely availability of Government
contributions (67 percent of original total project costs). Most of these risks did not
emerge as major issues because they were effectively addressed during implementation.
However, the anticipated risk of a shortfall in Government counterpart funding became a
serious reality. This problem was addressed at the first restructuring. Surprisingly
political risks were not anticipated as part of country risks. Nevertheless they emerged in
the form of a civil conflict in 2011-2012 in Blue Nile where it slowed down
implementation, and in South Kordofan where it brought most implementation to a halt

Quality at Entry. This project was included in a quality at entry learning review of
recipient executed trust funds by the Quality Assurance Group (QAG) in the Bank in
December 2007. The QAG review commended the task team on strong country
ownership of the project, its responsiveness to client demands, rigorous appraisal and
review, excellent collaboration with donors and UN agencies, and the relevance of the
social and gender assessment. However QAG concluded that the project was ambitious
and needed a more realistic time frame for implementation, the project documentation
needed to describe the overall program more clearly, and the assessment of country risks
was inadequate. In summary, the main problem at entry was the project’s ambitious
scope. Consequently the implementation task was too comprehensive to be managed
effectively by the weak MoH institutions at the start of the project.

2.2 Implementation 10

The project’s implementation faced a number of challenges, particularly during its early
years. However, actions by the project team generated good results as the project went
through three implementation phases, namely “establishment” (2007-2009),
“restructuring” (2009-2011), and “consolidation and expansion” (2012-2013).

Implementation performance reflected these phases. According to the Implementation
Supervision Reports (ISRs) the project was rated moderately unsatisfactory for most of
2008 (its first year after effectiveness) because of delayed release of Government
counterpart funding and its over ambitious scope. However, it achieved a moderately
satisfactory status in April 2009 after which the first restructuring occurred in May 2009
because the Government had advised that its counterpart funding obligations for this and
other MDTF-NS projects needed to be substantially reduced. In 2010 construction and
rehabilitation accelerated when additional MDTF funds were disbursed and PHC services
improved as enhanced facilities became available. The project was rated in the
satisfactory range from April 2009 to the time it closed in June 2013.

     A review of implementation by components is provided in Annex 2


                                                   12
The most important responses to challenges facing the project that led to its ultimate
satisfactory rating in the ISR when the project closed are listed below.

Slow implementation at the start was addressed strategically The project faced
many challenges during the year after approval. Time was needed to establish
institutional arrangements and meet conditions of effectiveness, and the shortfall in the
agreed disbursement of counterpart funds from the Government created delays in project
performance. Two and half years after effectiveness Government disbursements were
only $3.2 million out of a total commitment of $13 million for a planned three year
project. MDTF disbursements at that time lagged the planned level by about 50 percent.
This funding crisis led to the first restructuring which reduced the Government’s
contribution which was eventually only $3.2 million (see Annex 1 – financing table).
Funding from the MDTF increased by $6 million to $18 million. Restructuring also
reoriented the project’s broad scope to focus more on maternal and under-five death rates
which meant that some programs envisaged in the FPP were dropped – among them
disease control interventions and piloting of experiences to reduce barriers to access to
PHC services. This first restructuring led to an acceleration of implementation –
particularly for the infrastructure program to improve PHC services and the training of
midwives. The fourth restructuring consolidated the project’s structure into fewer
components (see Annex 1) with most of the $2 million additional funds allocated to
bolstering referral services, and expanding training and support for village midwives
including their training in North Kordofan.

Actions were taken to address institutional weaknesses after project start up. NGOs
which had the capacity and experience to support some aspects of the project’s objectives
were retained to fill institutional gaps when the project started. In 2008 the DHSDP
contracted an international NGO (GOAL) to provide basic health care services in
Kurmuk Locality (Blue Nile State) for 15,000 returnees from Ethiopia because of conflict.
Also, in the Kauda Locality (South Kordofan) the health training institute lacked
capacity and an international NGO (SCF-USA) was contracted to provide training until
civil conflict made it impossible to complete this contract.

Adjustments were made when civil war disrupted implementation in Blue Nile and
South Kordofan. The project’s progress in improving access to basic health care in Blue
Nile and South Kordofan States was significantly delayed between 2011 and 2013
because of violent civil conflict. With the exception of one locality the conflict in Blue
Nile State abated sufficiently to allow project activities to resume in 2012. However, by
the time the project closed in June 2013 it had still not been possible to resume regular
project activities in most of the targeted localities in South Kordofan State. As part of the
fourth restructuring additional funds were made available to rehabilitate a hospital in
peri-urban “rural” Port Sudan and the rehabilitation of three midwifery schools in El
Obeid, El Nuhud and Um Ruwaba to provide training of VMWs from South and North
Kordofan. Despite the difficult circumstances, the project was never designated as a
project at risk




                                             13
2.3 Monitoring and Evaluation (M&E) Design, Implementation and Utilization

Design. The FPP did not have a results matrix although key performance indicators were
clearly defined. 11 At the first restructuring a results matrix was, however, prepared. On
the other hand the FPP included a sub-component for designing a comprehensive national
M&E system for the health sector (described briefly in Annex 2 of this ICR) which
contributed to the development of the M&E design for this project. The official Sudan
Household Health Survey (SHHS) for 2006 provided baseline information on state-wide
parameters for the DHSDP. The State PIUs were responsible for regular collection of
data on these indicators from the participating health facilities and village midwives.
Compilation of data from the M&E program was managed by the Federal PIU. As
mentioned already, the implementation of this program was extended at first to four
target states and towards the end of the project South Kordofan State was added.
However, despite diligent work on project indicators by the project team, only one of the
indicators provided a direct measure of access to PHC and none of the outcome indicators
provided a direct measure of the basis for reform of the decentralized health care system.

Final and intermediate outcome indicators were revised at the first restructuring (see
Table 2). For the first objective one original and two revised key performance indicators
were relevant and robust including the addition of one discreet outcome indicator
(outpatient consultations per person per year) to measure access to PHC. For the second
objective there was, by definition, no final outcome indicator because activities such as
the NHA and associated training directed toward this objective were only initial steps and
hence only intermediate indicators.

While the Ministry established a sound M&E system for the project, the MDTF’s
Monitoring Agent (MA) was a constructive partner in the M&E process. The
Government’s ICR noted that the MA verified that state PIUs collaborated with the state
MOHs in assuring the veracity of the data collected.

Implementation. At the project’s start difficulties were encountered in obtaining the
necessary information for project monitoring. Inaccurate baselines stimulated a review of
the SHHS for 2006 mentioned above and data collection protocols were established.
There were also a number of changes in the M&E specialist in the Federal PIU.
Nevertheless, data on the project’s indicators were ultimately collected on a weekly and
monthly basis. According to the Federal PIU the collection rate varied between 85 and
100 percent. For health clinics which were not part of the DHSDP the response rate
averaged 30 percent but for some the rate was as high as 80 percent. Incentives were
paid using Government funds to some locality staff to ensure the assembly and delivery
of timely and accurate data.




11
 A results matrix was not included as part of simplified procedures authorized under the Bank’s
Operational Policy 8.00 dated March, 2007


                                                   14
Capacity to undertake structured analytical, monitoring and evaluation was strengthened.
Considerable resources were allocated to improving the capacity of the FMoH and
SMoHs to conduct monitoring and evaluation. For example the project funded a study to
establish baselines for indicators for the M&E system 12 as well as the formulation of an
M&E work plan and budget. This provided the basis for a set of health care indicators
which became the Health Management Information System (HMIS) for the Federal and
State Ministries of Health. In addition a series of annual Maternal Death Reviews was
started in 2009. While maternal death rate was not an outcome indicator for the project
because of the lack of reliable data, the monitoring of maternal death rates as part of this
project was an important start to the longer term evaluation of the project’s achievements.
No assessments were found of the quality of the studies, technical assistance and training.
However, an assessment of the quality of the construction program was prepared (see
Annex 2). There was also a situation analysis of the Maternal Death Review System. 13

Utilization. Regular monthly meetings were held in each target State to review the data
and monthly reports sent to the Federal PIU. Comprehensive quarterly reports were
prepared by the Federal PIU containing a summary, reports on physical progress,
achievement by components, reports on financial management and procurement, as well
as future work plans and a tabulation of the project’s compliance with the Grant
Agreement. Monitoring reports were used by the project’s management, the Ministry,
the World Bank and the Monitoring Agent to evaluate progress. They were also used to
compare performance among states and localities and against targets and explore
explanations. While the rigor of the M&E framework, data collection and management
was appreciated by the Government, it should be noted again that there was only one
outcome indicator that directly measured progress towards the project’s first objective of
access to improved basic health care services. However, indicators that focused on
reproductive health provided supporting evidence of progress on the improvement of
basic health care services.

2.4 Safeguard and Fiduciary Compliance

Safeguard Compliance. At project appraisal an Environmental and Social Management
Framework (ESMF) and a Resettlement Policy Framework (RPF) were chosen for the
project as mitigation instruments because at that time the sites and locations for the
construction of health facilities were not known. OP4.01 required a Medical Waste
Management Plan (MWMP) to ensure the effective collection and disposal of hazardous

medical waste at sites such as hospitals. Neither an ESMF nor an RPF was necessary
because there were no environmental, social or resettlement issues to be addressed. A
MWMP was completed, approved and disclosed by the Government and the Project
Coordinator within six months of project effectiveness with support from Bank
supervision missions. A framework for addressing the medical waste issues was
designed. The MoH prepared waste management policies and strategies, training
programs for environmental health officers, and waste management operational manuals
for hospitals. Medical waste incinerators were installed and fenced at all DHSDP-
supported facilities. The Federal and State Ministries of Health paid close attention to
waste management. It became standard policy and an environmental officer was
appointed in the FMoH.
Financial Management. The project used a series of four financial management
specialists in the Federal PIU during implementation. This disrupted continuity in this
function and led to one short period when financial management performance was rated
moderately unsatisfactory. However, with this exception, financial management in the
Federal and State PIUs was satisfactory. No financial control issues emerged in Bank
financial management supervision or Monitoring Agent reviews, and there were no
overdue or unacceptable audit reports or interim financial statements. The Government’s
ICR (Annex 7) noted, however, that the MA found that the fixed asset register did not
capture all details considered necessary for such a register. The FPIU advised that this
matter had been rectified when the project closed.
Procurement. The project employed qualified procurement officers in all PIUs.
Despite some turnover in procurement staff in the Federal PIUs, and with the support of
the MA, there were no major problems with the management of procurement activities.
By agreement with the Government, at the start of the project Federal PIU procurement
staff handled grant-financed procurements, while State PIUs handled government-
financed procurements, particularly health facility supplies and consumables. State PIU
staff managed the purchase of drugs and supplies for health facilities. The Federal PIU
managed Grant-financed procurement of works, goods and consultants. .

2.5 Post-completion Operation/Next Phase

The Government has been a strong supporter of the DHSDP and is satisfied with the
results so far. The Ministry of Finance and National Economy (MOFNE) therefore
decided to finance a long term program to continue the improvement of access to PHC in
Sudan. The Ministry has launched the “Primary Health Care Expansion Project”
modeled on the DHSDP including a component (30 percent) for the improvement and
new construction of health centers. Annual Government funding for this project is
anticipated to be SDG 70 million (US$13 million) although the federal government will
fund only infrastructure, medical equipment, drugs, consumables, and training. The
States will be expected to finance operating costs. The MoFNE anticipates that bilateral
donors will contribute to the project’s cost either directly or through a future multi-donor
trust fund. The Bank has been active in laying the groundwork for such support. The
Government’s project gives all Sudanese states the same implementation responsibilities
as the four target states in DHSDP. Federal and State MoHs will use the institutional


                                             16
capacity developed under DHSDP to facilitate fiduciary functions in all states as well as
provide coordination on policy and technical matters.

In order to broaden PHC beyond the focus areas for DHSDP, and at the same time sustain
this project’s progress on reproductive health, there will need to be continued training and
capacity building in order to ensure that VMWs provide services at adequate technical
standards and that first referral hospitals maintain their capacity to generate electricity,
pay for operating costs, have adequate staffing and perform their functions at high
standards. In future DHSDP’s sustainability in the context of the Government’s Primary
Health Care Expansion Project will be measured by reductions in maternal mortality
achieved.

3. Assessment of Outcomes

As noted in Section 1.3 the project development objective was not changed. However,
three out of the four key performance indicators for the project were dropped or amended
as part of the first restructuring. The first of these three was dropped for lack of data.
The reason for changing the second and third indicators was only to make them
measurable while maintaining their focus on the measurement of improvements in access
to PHC and to reproductive health. Nevertheless, in accordance with the Guidelines 14
the following assessment of outcomes will be based on relevance, achievements and
efficiency before and after the first restructuring when the changes in indicators were
formally approved, and will then evaluate the overall outcome with weights based on the
value of disbursements before and after this restructuring. 15

3.1 Relevance of Objectives, Design and Implementation

Relevance of Objectives (Rating: Satisfactory before and after restructuring).

Since the project objectives did not change the following assessment of the relevance of
objectives applies equally to the project before and after the restructuring. The project’s
two part objective of “improving access to basic health services by conflict-affected and
underserved populations” and “establishing the basis for reform, sustainable financing,
and development of the decentralized health system” was relevant to the stated objectives
of the FMoH program to strengthen the capacity of health administrations in localities,
achieve the MDGs, and to the Government’s “Road Map for Reducing Maternal


14
  “Implementation Completion and Results Report – Guidelines”, OPCS, updated 11/10/2010, states that
“For those operations where there was a formal change in PDO/GEO or key associated outcome targets ….
the evaluation method for determining the outcome rating (should) take into account both the original and
formally revised objectives or targets”, page 25. It is assumed that the same principle should apply to
changes in indicators.

15
  The first restructuring will be referred to as “the restructuring” unless there is a need to distinguish it
from the other project restructurings The three other restructurings did not involve changes in the PDO or
the indicators..


                                                     17
Mortality and New Born Mortality in Sudan”. The objectives were also relevant to the
MDTF’s focus on recovery and development in conflict-affected regions of Sudan, and
the World Bank’s Interim Strategy Notes (ISNs) for FY 07-09 which continued to FY13
and the ISN for FY14-15. The results matrix for the FY07-09 ISN included a strategic
objective to “Develop core capacities and components of the health system at the same
time as supporting rapid expansion of service delivery and selected high-impact
preventive health interventions, particularly in war-affected or marginalized areas”. The
objectives remain relevant for the future. The Sudan ISN for FY14-15 makes the
commitment to provide “Support to national and local programs for service delivery
focusing on key human outcomes” in the second pillar of the strategy. 16 The
Government’s initiative to fund its “Primary Health Care Expansion Project” reflects the
continued substantial relevance at exit of the DHSDP model as a basis for a sustainable
and decentralized basic health care system in Sudan. The relevance of the project’s
objectives before and after restructuring had only minor shortcomings.

Relevance of Design (Rating: Unsatisfactory before restructuring; Satisfactory after
restructuring).

Before and after restructuring the project’s core design, which made the Federal and State
PIUs responsible for advice, facilitation and fiduciary activities, continued to be relevant
throughout implementation. This approach was consistent with the national objectives of
improving and sustaining decentralized basic health services. This aspect of the project’s
design was therefore relevant to the project’s objectives before and after restructuring.

However, before restructuring the scope of DHSDP’s activities to “improve access to
basic health care services by conflict-affected and underserved populations” was overly
complex and ambitious because it covered numerous elements in basic health care
services to be implemented in three phases over only 4 to 5 years without a results matrix
or adequate funding due to a shortfall in Government disbursements. With no prospects
for resolving these problems the best solution was restructuring to, inter alia, seek
alternative sources of financing and sharpen the project’s focus on reproductive health
and under-five mortality while not abandoning the objective of increasing access to PHC
services. In conclusion, before restructuring the relevance of the project’s scope had
major shortcomings.

After restructuring, when a results matrix with improved and more concise indicators had
been defined, the project’s design features and scope were more relevant to the project’s
first objective of improving access to basic health care services. The project’s design to
achieve the second objective was defined by a number of studies. While those studies
were relevant it was not clear how their results would lead to “reform, sustainable
financing and development of the decentralized health system”. In conclusion, after
restructuring, the relevance of the project’s design and scope had minor shortcomings.

.
Relevance of Implementation (Rating: Moderately Unsatisfactory before restructuring;
Satisfactory after restructuring).

Before restructuring the project’s implementation was relevant to the challenges facing
PHC as well as to “reform, sustainable financing and development of the decentralized
health system” as reflected in a number of achievements such as the distribution of bed
nets, the improvement of a number of health facilities leading to increased consultations,
and the initiation of a number of studies on reforms in the health sector. On the other
hand accomplishments from implementation failed because of the shortfall in
Government disbursements weak capacity of the national counterparts and hence the
relevance of implementation was significantly reduced. Therefore before restructuring
the relevance of the project’s implementation had significant shortcomings.

After restructuring, when the financial arrangements for the project had been changed
and project activities reformulated, project implementation became substantially more
relevant to improving access to PHC because increased funds were available for
financing construction/rehabilitation of health facilities, the delivery of pharmaceuticals,
services and training. The FMoH viewed the training of midwives as the most relevant
aspect of the project’s implementation because trained midwives improved antenatal care,
identified pregnancy problems early and, to a certain extent could arrange referrals to
appropriate specialist care, therefore contributing to reductions in maternal deaths. This
training was eventually a highly relevant contribution to the project’s implementation and
sustainability. After restructuring the relevance of the project’s implementation had only
minor shortcomings.


3.2 Achievement of Project Development Objectives (Rating: Moderately
Unsatisfactory before restructuring; Satisfactory after restructuring)

The extent to which the project’s two objectives were achieved is evaluated separately.

       (a) Improving access to basic health services by conflict-affected and
           underserved populations in four target states (Rating: Moderately
           Unsatisfactory before restructuring; Satisfactory after restructuring)

(i) Activities 17

Chain of activities. Following the change in the project’s main focus to reproductive
health the activities financed by DHSDP’s first objective were achieved through a chain
of interrelated activities. The first activity was arranging project management at the
Federal and State levels. This was followed by investments in primary health care
service and training facilities, the training of health care professionals, and support for a

     Additional information on project outputs is provided in Annex 2


                                                      19
hierarchy of health care workers such as health visitors, and assistant health visitors who
supervised the services at PHC facilities and the activities of village midwives at the
locality level to ensure the satisfactory quality of primary health care services. Finally, if
emergency obstetric care (EOC) was required then teams at rural and state hospitals,
supported in part by the DHSDP, became involved. This was an effective chain of
activities. This chain of activities was the same before and after restructuring.

(ii) Outputs

Health and training facilities were improved and increased. Before restructuring the
project’s performance was rated moderately unsatisfactory largely due to the fact that
project design was too broad and ambitious. Only parts of the program had been fully
funded due to a substantial shortfall in Government counterpart funding and weak
institutional capacity. After restructuring an additional $3.5 million was available from
the MDTF for the rehabilitation and construction program for rural hospitals, health
training academies and various VMW training centers were enlarged. Another $2.5
million was available for improving primary health care services along with the financing
of medical supplies and equipment at 58 health facilities in targeted poor localities to
enhance mother and child health care. After restructuring village midwifery training
programs were expanded contributing to increased access to antenatal care and deliveries
for pregnant women which were assisted by skilled health staff. This was a substantial
contribution to the improvement of primary reproductive health care. There were only
minor shortcomings in health and training facilities after restructuring.

Considerable training achieved. Training activities financed by DHSDP were not
started until after restructuring. By the final closing date 3,095 health professionals
(including village midwives) were trained under this project which enhanced the
professional competence and confidence of the MoH reproductive health staff in the four
target states. Annex Table 2H shows the increase in coverage of villages which have
formally trained village midwives in Blue Nile, Kassala and Red Sea States. For
example, of the 393 villages in Kassala State 232 villages (59 percent) had trained
midwives in June 2013 compared with 52 villages (13 percent) in 2009. In addition,
health facilities had been improved and equipped at 46 locations compared with the target
of 58. Given the difficulties this was a substantial result with only minor shortcomings.

Capacity building activities for VMWs. While the Federal MoH already had a policy
of support for midwifery programs to reduce maternal mortality, the DHSDP provided
additional support for this policy resulting in significant increases in trained VMWs after
restructuring. 18 Annex Table 2G records the number of VMWs who have graduated
from training during DHSDP implementation after restructuring. It shows that 675
midwives graduated from basic training since 2010. 19 The Bank’s budget financed a

   Out of the $6 million additional financing from the MDTF-NS in the first restructuring, $2.8 million was
allocated to support for village midwives and their training.

     There are currently about 15,000 trained village midwives in all Sudan.

study exploring ways to strengthen the VMW system and make it more sustainable
through the integration of midwives with women’s groups in communities. It also
financed an assessment of the performance of the VMW program in Blue Nile and
Kassala states. 20 There were, however, no evaluations of the quality of the VMW
training program and hence the substantive results have been difficult to evaluate.
Nevertheless, the increase in numbers was a substantial step forward.

(iii) Intermediate Outcomes

Table 3 shows substantial results for the project’s intermediate outcome indicators.

     •   179,000 insecticide treated malaria nets were distributed. The distribution
         covered about one-third of the rural population in the four target states and 42
         percent had at least one ITN. This was achieved before restructuring.
     •   Investment targets met. The target number of training and PHC facilities
         rehabilitated/equipped, and number of rural hospitals upgraded/equipped are also
         shown against the final achievement. In all cases the targets were met. This was
         achieved after restructuring.

(iv) Outcomes

Before restructuring the project established four outcome indicators (see Table 2); their
relevance and achievements can be summarized as follows:

   •   Outpatient consultations per person per year. There are no data available for
       this indicator before 2010. It is assumed that because of the delays in project
       implementation before restructuring that this indicator had significant
       shortcomings – in line with the assessment of the project in the ISR before
       restructuring
   •   Patient ratio between highest and lowest wealth quintile. This indicator was
       not measurable with available monitoring programs and hence it was not rated.
       The indicator was dropped at restructuring.
   •   Percent of patients who do not receive health care due to financial barriers in
       target areas. This indicator was not measurable and hence it was not rated. The
       indicator was replaced at restructuring by “percent of pregnant women with at
       least one antenatal consultation”.
   •   Skilled birth attendance in target areas. This indicator was not measurable and
       hence it was not rated. The indicator was replaced at restructuring by “percent of
       births attended by skilled health staff”.

After restructuring the project defined three outcome indicators for the first objective -
namely outpatient consultations per person per year, percent of pregnant women having
at least one antenatal consultation, and percent of births attended by skilled health staff.
The average results during project implementation for these indicators compared with
their targets are shown in Table 4. The following points are relevant to the evaluation of
each of these outcomes.

   •   Outpatient Consultations per person per year in target areas increased
       substantially but varied considerably between localities. There was
       variability at the locality level due to seasonality (particularly in Red Sea State),
       the effects of the security situation (in two of the three target localities in Blue
       Nile and South Kordofan State), and the availability of drugs and consumables
       provided by the project. This is the only direct overall measure of increased
       access to basic health care and shows substantial improvement since December
       2010 meeting the target established by the project. However, project documents
       provided no standard against which to judge the achievement and it is therefore
       assessed as having minor shortcomings
   •   Percent pregnant women with at least one antenatal consultation increased.
       Since December 2010 (about 18 months after restructuring), the average
       incidence of antenatal consultations increased from 59 percent to 68 percent (3
       percent below the target) due to increased coverage in Kassala and Red Sea which
       in turn resulted from the recruitment of midwifery school graduates by
       contracting and incentives through a pilot program of payments for specific
       services. Kassala and Red Sea States organized outreach activities. Red Sea
       State added a Rural Port Sudan locality in its coverage because of its high

                                             22
         incidence of poverty. Overall the improvement to within 3 percent of the target
         was an achievement with minor shortcomings.
    •    Percent of births attended by skilled health staff. A substantial improvement
         from a base of 19 percent in 2008/2009 to 63 percent in June 2013. This
         achievement had no shortcomings.

Attribution. The focus localities for this project were among the poorest in the state and
typically remote where investments in the health sector other than by the Government
and DHSDP were rare. Hence most, if not all, improvements in PHC (including
reproductive health services) would have been attributable to DHSDP assistance.

Maternal Death Rates. A higher order outcome indicator for measuring improvements
in reproductive health would be changes in the maternal mortality rate. This was not
defined as an outcome indicator for the project but information on it was collected in
three Maternal Death Reviews financed by the DHSDP in 2011, 2012 and 2013. These
reviews were exploratory because of incomplete and fragile data. For example, although
notification of maternal deaths to the locality authorities is compulsory by law, not all
deaths are reported, and when reported the cause of death is often inaccurate. The data in
Table 5 suggest a decline in notified deaths, but in 2012 they are only about two-thirds of
expected deaths (based on demographic estimates).

The relatively slow progress in reducing maternal death rates in Red Sea and South
Kordofan was said to be due to modest infrastructure, inadequate staffing, poor
equipment, variable power and no blood supplies at hospitals, as well as a dysfunctional
referral system. It should also be added that one of the findings of the Maternal Death
Reviews was that more than 90 percent of all maternal deaths occur among women who
had no antenatal care or irregular antenatal care visits. To the extent that the DHSDP
increased antenatal care it may have contributed to reductions in maternal deaths.

           (b) Establishing the basis for reform, sustainable financing, and
           development of the decentralized health system (Rating: Moderately
           Satisfactory before and after restructuring)

(i) Activities 21

A number of substantial activities were planned to be concluded soon after restructuring
but they were not concluded until well after restructuring. They did, however, provide a
contribution to establishing the basis for the reform of a sustainable and decentralized
health system. The two most prominent were analyses of health care financing including
the National Health Accounts (NHA) implemented with technical assistance from the
World Health Organization (WHO), and a capacity building program in the Federal and
State Ministries of Health implemented with technical assistance from an international
consultancy firm.

(ii) Outputs

Health care financing in Sudan. Before restructuring in May 2009 the project
contracted WHO to undertake a comprehensive assessment of health care financing in
Sudan but there were significant delays in completing the contract and it was finally
completed after the restructuring. The work included the preparation of national health
accounts, household health services utilization survey, a review of options for the
expansion of the NHIF, a review of knowledge, attitudes and practices on health care in
Sudanese households, and a summary of the coverage of the comprehensive PHC
package. The assessment of the cost of the PHC package by the FMoH was not delivered

     Additional information on outputs is provided in Annex 2.


                                                      24
but has since been completed. This work had moderate shortcomings before
restructuring. Nevertheless WHO delivered its report in June 2012. It was a substantial
result complemented by follow up technical assistance and training. The NHA is
regularly updated in the Ministry of Health and used in development planning. Overall
this work, while delayed well beyond its original delivery date, had only minor
shortcomings after restructuring.

Capacity building for planning future health care programs at Federal and State
levels. Before restructuring an international consulting firm was retained to provide
technical assistance to strengthen the capacity of the Federal and State Ministries of
Health to plan, budget and manage health services, strengthen human resources for health
strategies, and improve monitoring and evaluation of health systems at state and locality
levels. The inception phase of this contract started in August 2008 and implementation
was completed after restructuring in January 2010. Activities were aligned with the
National Health Policy and the development objectives of the State Ministries of Health.
All outputs were developed in working sessions with health professionals in the Federal
and State ministries. In the area of policy reform and analysis the substantial
improvement in the capacity of the State Ministries of Health has been a major
achievement representing the vanguard of a decentralized and sustainable health system.
This was also a substantial result with minor shortcomings. Additional capacity building
support was provided from other sources including the MDTF-financed Technical
Assistance Facility which financed the costs of management training for staff from the
FMoH, SMoHs and the Public Health Institute at the University of Washington in
Washington State (USA) who would later became trainers of trainers.

Other Studies. A number of other studies relevant to the reform of the health sector were
financed by the DHSDP as well as by the World Bank’s operational budget before and
after restructuring. These studies were all completed after restructuring. For example, a
joint study by the Government, the MDTF-NS and the Bank’s budget was the Public
Expenditure Tracking Survey (PETS) which focused on the health sector in six states,
including the four target states in this project conducted in 2010 and completed in 2011. 22
Another significant study was “Free Health Care for Under-Five Children and Pregnant
Women in Northern Sudan: Progress so Far and Recommendations for the Future
prepared by a Technical Working Group in the Federal Ministry of Health led by Sophie
Witter and completed in September 2010. Following this study a one year pilot in the
four target states was launched by the NHIF which incorporates the study’s main
recommendations. Another study was a “Brief Assessment of the First Referral System”
completed May, 2012 with a concrete proposal for a “first level component” to be
included in the second additional financing for the DHSDP (fourth restructuring);
however support was not strong enough and the implementation period for the project
was coming to an end. 23

On balance the technical assistance and studies intended to provide the basis for reform,
sustainable financing, and development of a decentralized health system were useful to
the Ministries of Health A salutary characteristic of this project was the substantial and
relevant analytical work that accompanied the investment component.

(iii) Intermediate Outcomes

The FPP stated that the implementation of reform and a decentralized health system was
anticipated beyond the time frame of the project (page 19) but that DHSDP would
provide the “basis for reform”. No outcome indicators were defined in the FPP, but as
part of the First Restructuring two intermediate outcome indicators were defined for the
“basis for reform”. They were “annual per capita US$ value of drugs/consumables and
operational support provided to target health facilities and midwives”, and “completion of
National Health Accounts”.

     •   Increased annual per capita value of support to health facilities and
         midwives. The value of drugs, consumables and operational support to health
         facilities and midwives was calculated to be $0.17 per capita at the start of the
         project. The target at the end of the project was $0.40 per capita. In the event the
         average achievement for all target states was $0.36 per capita in June 2013
         although it had been as high as $0.48 per capita in 2010. While the project
         established a target for this indicator, it did not establish a rationale for the target
         nor a norm or adequate level for the indicator against which the achievement
         could be compared. One way to assess the aggregate allocation is to compare it
         with the value of drugs distributed for free care by states. The latest data
         available show that the per capita value of drugs for free distribution to children
         under five and pregnant women in Blue Nile, Kassala, Red Sea and South
         Kordofan in 2009 was SDG 1.30, SDG0.68, SDG0.77 and SDG0.98 respectively.
         It was SDG0.73 in all “northern” States. 24 For the four target states these per
         capita levels were equivalent to $0.56, $0.29, $0.33 and $0.43 at an exchange rate
         in 2009 of SDG2.9 = $1.0. However, evidence based on data from Red Sea state
         indicates that the distribution of funds within a state goes predominantly to urban
         hospitals and only 21 and 6 percent respectively went to rural hospitals and health
         centers. These data, though for three years earlier than the current data for the
         project, suggest that the contribution of DHSDP to the resources of rural health
         facilities to the target states on a per capita basis has been significant and its
         distribution was almost certainly more effectively targeted to the poorest and
         needy groups. On balance this intermediate outcome had moderate shortcomings
         before and after restructuring because until the assessment of the cost of the PHC
         package by the FMoH is available the relevance of the value of drugs,
         consumables and operational support to health facilities and midwives assessed by
         this project will not be known.

     •   National Health Accounts. This intermediate outcome indicator required the
         completion of the National Health Accounts. Annex 2 provides a summary of
         the achievements under this heading. The review and analysis of health care
         financing was comprehensive and provided a building block for planning future
         sustainable decentralized financing of PHC services and hence was a direct and
         relevant contribution to the project’s second objective. As noted already, the
         completion of this work was substantially delayed and hence before restructuring
         it had moderate shortcomings. Nevertheless the NHA was completed and this
         intermediate objective was achieved with minor shortcomings. However,
         ultimately the basis for a sustainable financing and development of a
         decentralized health system is not under the control of the FMoH because the
         FFAMC and the MOFNE control the formula for allocations to the states for basic
         health care programs.

3.3 Efficiency (Rating: Moderately Unsatisfactory before restructuring; Satisfactory after
restructuring))

The FPP reviewed various approaches to estimating the returns from investments in
primary health care, but it did not estimate an expected rate of return from the DHSDP.
The efficiency of this project in addressing its first and second objectives is assessed in
terms of management and implementation efficiency as well as its cost-effectiveness.
The assessment is framed in terms of whether the project provided “value for money”.
The analysis of efficiency in this ICR is elaborated in Annex 3.

     (a) Efficiency in Improving Access to Basic Health Care

Management efficiency. DHSDP was under the energetic leadership and management
of the FMoH and the SMoHs supported by the Federal and State PIUs which improved
over time. The continuity of core personnel was satisfactory, except for fiduciary
management, and a testament to the overall management of the PIUs. However the cost
of project management was 13 percent of total costs compared with the original estimate
of 5 percent. The original estimate of management costs might have been unrealistically
low for the first phase in view of the legacy of conflict, and there was indeed more
conflict in Blue Nile and South Kordofan during implementation than anticipated. While
13 percent is a high percentage compared with similar projects, it should be
acknowledged that Sudan is classified as a post conflict country with ongoing conflict in
some regions. Costs under these circumstances are known to be high 25 On balance,
management efficiency had moderate shortcomings before restructuring and minor
shortcomings after restructuring.

25
  There is no known data base on project management costs for health projects but there are data on Bank
supervision costs in Fragile and Conflict-Affected States (FCS). For example, see “World Bank Assistance
to Low-Income and Fragile and Conflict-Affected States: An IEG Evaluation”, 2013 which noted that “The
unit cost of supervision in Always FCS IDA in FY12 was 18 percent higher than in Never FCS IDA
countries”; paragraph 8.25.


                                                  27
Implementation efficiency. The Monitoring Agent noted that project implementation
improved from its original weak phase with significant shortcomings (before
restructuring) to the final phase of development (after restructuring) when
implementation had minor shortcomings. After restructuring the project was focused
and effective in pursuing the achievement of the project’s first objective. Almost all the
implementation targets for the renovation or construction of primary health care facilities
as well as training facilities, with heavy focus on the training of village midwives
(VMWs), were achieved. Innovative approaches such as the organization of midwifery
training at locality level near beneficiary communities to overcome traditional constraints
on young female students travelling unaccompanied to main towns contributed to a high
training output and increased numbers of trained midwives in remote villages.
Reproductive health care (a basic health care issue) as measured by the incidence of both
antenatal care and births attended by skilled health staff improved. Concurrently
outpatient consultations per person per year doubled but only after restructuring. The
project effectively achieved its targets. Although these were substantial achievements the
three year delay at the start of the project before restructuring was not an efficient use of
time or resources. In addition there was little progress in South Kordofan because of the
civil conflict there. On balance implementation efficiency had significant shortcomings
before restructuring but minor shortcomings after restructuring.

Cost-Effectiveness. The overall conclusion of the analysis of the value of the disability
life years averted as a result of improved reproductive health and increased access to
primary health care in Annex 3 was that for each dollar of cost the project generated two
dollar’s worth of benefits because of reduced maternal mortality and the diseases averted
through increased access to primary health care. Despite the many assumptions that
needed to be made to complete the DALY analysis, results suggest minor shortcomings
in efficiency because the present value of benefits is twice the present value of costs. In
addition this analysis does not include any assessment of net social benefits from reduced
mortality or disability for families and society. In summary, cost effectiveness had
minor shortcomings after restructuring. Because the project was not on track with a poor
project design, shortfalls in financing and not able to achieve anticipated benefits before
restructuring there were major shortcomings in cost-effectiveness during that period.

   (b) Efficiency in establishing a basis for reform, sustainable financing, and
       development of the decentralized health system.

While WHO completed the contract to analyze health care financing, contract
implementation was delayed for various reasons including the inclusion of additional
activities financed by sources other than DHSDP. Also, one sub-contract with the FMoH
for estimating the cost of the basic health care package was not finished and the impact of
the NHA on actual allocations of federal funds to the states for primary health care is not
clear.. However the FMoH advised that the improved capacity for health policy analysis
in the Ministry enhanced the “basis for future reform, sustainable financing, and
development of the decentralized health system”. By this measure NHA was effective,



                                             28
but not necessarily cost-effective – and hence it is concluded that the efficiency of NHA
had moderate shortcomings before and after restructuring.

3.4 Justification of Overall Outcome Rating
Rating: Moderately Satisfactory

Relevance. The relevance of this project’s first objective, design and implementation
before restructuring was rated as moderately unsatisfactory (see Annex Table 2J for a
summary of all ratings based on the text above). Relevance after restructuring was rated
as satisfactory. . The project’s relevance to reforming the health sector to put it on a
sustainable path to a decentralized system (i.e. the second objective) was also rated
moderately unsatisfactory before restructuring and satisfactory after restructuring.

Achievements. Before restructuring it was only possible to rate one of the original four
key performance indicators for the first objective because three of them were not
measurable which was the reason they were changed at restructuring. The achievement
based on the one measurable indicator was rated as moderately unsatisfactory. At exit,
using this indicator and two of the other three, the project was rated as satisfactory.
With respect to the second objective, considerable capacity building through an intensive
training program was achieved before and after restructuring. The project also provided a
basis for the reform of the health sector because of better data on health care financing
(NHA) and improved capacity for health policy analysis in the FMoH even though there
was no definition of exactly what was expected from this part of the PDO. The project’s
achievements were rated as moderately satisfactory before and satisfactory after
restructuring.

Efficiency. A rate of return for this project was not estimated because of the difficulties
in measuring the benefits flowing from the achievements relevant to the first objective.
There were, however, moderate shortcomings in the project’s managerial efficiency
before restructuring.. On the other hand implementation efficiency after restructuring had
minor shortcomings. The cost-effectiveness with which this project has delivered
improved basic health care services to pregnant women and new born children could not
be directly assessed. However an estimate was made of the disability adjusted life years
(DALYs) after restructuring and the project was found to be cost-effective (see Annex 3
for the analytical basis for this conclusion). Before restructuring the project had used 36
percent of funding and shown few results supporting to the conclusion that there were
major shortcomings in efficiency before restructuring.

In summary, based on the conclusions above, the project outcome before restructuring is
rated as moderately unsatisfactory. After restructuring project outcome is rated as
satisfactory. A weighted average outcome for the project’s phases before and after
restructuring (weighted by disbursements in each phase) is moderately satisfactory.
Annex Tables 2J and 2K provide the basis for this result.

3.5 Overarching Themes, Other Outcomes and Impacts

(a) Poverty Impacts, Gender Aspects, and Social Development

The project targeted the poorest 21 localities in four target states. It supported
Government policy that primary health care should be free for all and all health care
should be free for the poor. Gender aspects permeated the project from the start. Most of
the suggestions in the “Social and Gender Assessment” prepared at project preparation
were adopted. After the first restructuring the project was mainly oriented towards
benefitting pregnant women. Communities were prominent in project implementation
such as in supporting the work of village midwives.

(b) Institutional Change/Strengthening

The project built capacity in the Federal and State MoHs through training programs and
empowering the state ministries. The status of village midwives was raised and their
success as an institution was reflected in the increased proportion of antenatal
consultations and births attended by skilled health staff during the project.

(c) Other Unintended Outcomes and Impacts (positive or negative)

The FMoH used the DHSDP model to obtain additional funds from the GAVI and Global
Funds for respectively $16.1 million and $30 million for activities aligned with the
DHSDP. Another unexpected impact was that World Bank budget funds and the MDTF-
NS Bank–executed funds (allocated to the Technical Secretariat) were attracted for
analytical work on the health sector in Sudan.

3.6 Summary of Findings of Beneficiary Survey and/or Stakeholder Workshops

No stakeholder workshop was conducted although regular consultations with
beneficiaries were held to seek their feedback on the project during implementation..

4. Assessment of Risk to Development Outcome
Rating: Significant

As the Assessment of Program Sustainability prepared by the MDTF-NS states,
“replicability of MDTF-NS projects is closely related to their sustainability” 26. It is
therefore salutary that the Federal Ministry of Finance and National Economy (MOFNE)
decided to replicate DHSDP and will finance a long term program to continue the
improvement of primary health care in Sudan. The Ministry has already launched the
“Primary Health Care Expansion Project” modeled on the DHSDP which includes a
component (30 percent of project cost) for the improvement and new construction of

rural hospitals. Government funding is anticipated to be SDG 70 million annually
(US$13 million) although, as mentioned already, the states need to contribute significant
operational costs. Nevertheless, institutional capacity to support sustained
implementation will be a challenge for this project.

Although it is Government policy to provide free primary health care, reports show that
patients are paying a significant part of basic health care costs. 27 It is likely that future
primary health care services will not be sustainable without some cost recovery through
fees and health insurance programs. About 30 percent of the population (mainly
employees of the government and private companies in urban areas) is currently covered
by health insurance (predominantly the National Health Insurance Fund - NHIF). The
NHIF and the Government are assessing ways to increase this percentage in rural areas.
DHSDP supported this goal through studies of necessary conditions for health care
financing and the costs of universal primary health care coverage. 28

At the national level ownership of the DHSDP model is strong, but financial and political
risks in Sudan are substantial. On the financial side budgets are fragile and
comprehensive health insurance is still a long way from being established and hence even
partial cost recovery in poor rural areas will be a huge challenge. Political risks are hard
to assess but the most difficult issue is the reliability of increased allocations of the
federal budget to the states. On balance the risks to the continued implementation of the
DHSDP model with its substantial subsidies are significant.

5. Assessment of Bank and Borrower Performance

5.1 Bank Performance

(a) Bank Performance in Ensuring Quality at Entry
Rating: Moderately Unsatisfactory

The project was strategically relevant to Sudan’s health sector. It was strategic because it
was in line with the Government’s health policy, addressed poverty reduction, and was
limited to 19 poor localities in four states. The FPP was well prepared and
comprehensive with respect to technical issues but too ambitious in terms of the scope of
activities with project indicators that were weak and in some cases not measureable. The
QAG learning review also questioned the project’s ambitions and added that the FPP did
not describe the project clearly. The FPP did, however, provide a sound basis for
empowering both Federal and State MoHs to take the responsibility for project
implementation. While QAG also noted that the FPP was too sanguine about the
Government’s assurances on the payment of counterpart funds, the financing
arrangements in the project followed standard practice because it had been agreed
formally when the MDTF-NS was established that the Government would contribute
twice the MDTF contribution. In the event, for various reasons, the Government was not
able to meet its financial commitment to this project which created considerable delays
during the project’s first two years. 29 On balance the overly ambitious scope within a
short time frame, a project description that needed elaboration and the shortfall in the
Government’s funding suggest that quality at entry had significant shortcomings.

(b) Quality of Supervision
Rating: Satisfactory

The project was competently supervised by TTLs based in Washington during the
project’s first phase and from Khartoum for the remainder of the project when the TTL
was a staff member of the MDTF-NS Technical Secretariat. Typically there were two to
three supervision missions per year. The quality and effectiveness of supervision together
with the technical assistance provided at various stages during implementation to the
FMoH (e.g. assistance with the project’s annual budgeting) was appreciated by the
Federal MoH staff and management. Supervision reports were detailed and the TTL
maintained regular contact with the Federal MoH, Federal PIU and State PIUs. Problems
or issues were quickly resolved. Senior management of the FMoH appreciated the
support and advice from the Bank/MDTF-NS Technical Secretariat. Financial
management and procurement were systematically supported and compliance with
safeguard policies was closely monitored. Overall there were only minor shortcomings
in project supervision, the main ones being the delays in arriving at an agreement within
the Bank and between the MDTF Secretariat and the Government on the terms and
conditions of the project’s first restructuring.


29
     The Final Project Proposal had indicated the possibility of delays in Government contributions (page 63)

(c) Justification of Rating for Overall Bank Performance
Rating: Moderately Satisfactory

With significant shortcomings in quality at entry and minor shortcomings in supervision
the overall performance of the Bank and the MDTF-NS was moderately satisfactory.

5.2 Borrower Performance

(a) Government Performance
Rating: Moderately Unsatisfactory

The Government, through the FMoH, was a strong supporter of the DHSDP and the
FMoH Directorate of Planning was closely involved with the project’s design. But, as it
had to prioritize its financial commitment to the MDTF-NS to other MDTF projects
(Census and New Currency projects which required substantial funding), the Government
was not able to meet all its financial commitments to DHSDP. This slowed progress at
the start and was one reason for the First Restructuring. Restructuring substantially
reduced the Government’s direct contribution, but the Government asserted that it made
contributions to ongoing costs of PHC through its regular budget. This was partially
verified, as some of the project’s activities that were supposed to be paid by Government
were finally implemented (e.g., rehabilitation of training academies at state level).
However, a matter that posed serious problems during implementation was the
inadequate professional staffing at DHSDP-improved facilities due partly due to extreme
difficulty in deploying qualified staff to more remote areas. These were significant
shortcomings in the Borrower’s performance.

(b) Implementing Agencies’ Performance
Rating: Satisfactory

The Federal and State PIUs functioned efficiently and provided the project with much
energy and excellent facilitation and leadership. At the State level PIU staffing was the
same throughout implementation. The Government’s ICR ascribes this mainly to the
project’s clear objective. Most of the project’s implementation was done effectively by
departments and units of the Ministries of Health at all levels. This resulted from
empowering a ministry to be responsible for project implementation. There were minor
shortcomings in the performance of the PIUs.

(c) Justification of Rating for Overall Borrower Performance
Rating: Moderately Satisfactory

Based on a moderately unsatisfactory performance by the Government and a satisfactory
performance by the implementing agencies the overall performance of the Borrower was
moderately satisfactory.




                                            33
6. LESSONS LEARNED

Lessons with general relevance discussed below supplement a number of interesting
lessons in the Government’s ICR

Projects overloaded with activities create implementation problems. It is tempting
for a government and task managers, when provided with an opportunity to address post
conflict development challenges, to load a project with numerous activities which are all
seen as priorities. This occurred in this project. Under the weight of Government
requests too many activities were planned in a weak institutional implementation
environment creating substantial implementation problems. The clear lesson is to keep
project objectives and scope limited and consistent with implementation capacity.

Project restructuring should be done as early as possible. Restructuring early to
resolve implementation problems is important to give time for a successful response to
implementation constraints. Delayed restructuring of a dysfunctional project takes longer
because commitments made during a project’s early phases can usually not be undone
and that reduces the degrees of freedom for restructuring.

Lessons relevant to this project were as follows:

Flexibility in design is a major advantage. A core feature of the design of this project
was the empowerment of the state MoHs by the Federal MoH to manage the project’s
activities. This in turn depended on competent PIUs which were empowered to take
decisions, make progress at the locality levels and achieve results. It was this flexibility,
which the government’s ICR also recognized that, for example, provided the scope to
move basic midwifery training from schools in state capitals to locations close to
communities to overcome traditional constraints on women moving to cities and towns
(away from their villages) for education.

Complexity creates problems. Implementation was expected on a wide range of
activities from sector analysis, health facility construction, and developing the capacity to
address all diseases posed an overwhelming management challenge for weak health
sector institutions in the states and progress was slow. Once the range of activities was
substantially reduced at the first restructuring the project’s progress accelerated as it
became more focused on improving reproductive health within an unchanged overall set
of objectives.

Future sustainability of primary health services will depend on the actions of
Federal and State public health institutions responsible. To make affordable primary
health care services sustainable Governments will need to provide adequate financial
resources for operating and maintaining primary health facilities, establish technical and
institutional capacity to provide the services, stimulate fiduciary and risk management,
and establish a sustainable health insurance program. Without these elements the
sustainable provision of primary health services in Sudan is unlikely.



                                              34
Strategic studies can provide information for future planning. This project financed
many studies which provided the basis for future progress on difficult issues. For
example, in parallel with the project’s focus on improving reproductive health it financed
a series of maternal death reviews which over time will fill important information gaps on
the causes of maternal deaths for which data at present are weak. This information could
provide the basis for future investments to reduce the rate of maternal mortality.

                          ANNEX 2. OUTPUTS BY COMPONENT

This is a summary evaluation of outputs from the project’s two main components and
their sub-components. As mentioned in Section 1.6 of this ICR the project’s components
were restructured with some additional financing and delays in closing dates at various
times during implementation. This annex will therefore assess outputs before and after
restructuring. Annex Table 2A summarizes the impact of restructuring on the project’s
components. Annex Table 2B summarizes physical outputs by states and the overall
training of health professionals achieved aggregated across four states. 30

In 2011 and 2012 Blue Nile and South Kordofan experienced severe civil conflict which
led to a temporary halt in activities in Blue Nile but with a major impact on the Bao
locality. The conflict stopped most implementation in South Kordofan. As a result the
PIU in South Kordofan was disbanded and implementation suffered substantially.
Therefore results in South Kordofan were often less than the targets and also not recorded
from the end of 2011.

Component 1: Expanding access to primary health care services by underserved
populations.

This core component squarely addressed the project’s first objective to improve access to
primary health care (PHC) services for people in the former conflict-affected areas in
four target states. It was originally designed to provide assistance in two domains,
namely improving the quality of existing primary health care services, expansion of
coverage of primary health care services and high-impact interventions, and piloting
experiences to reduce barriers to access to primary health care. The scope of this
component’s activities was changed as a result of the project’s first and fourth
restructuring. It was renamed and consolidated. The First Restructuring reduced the
scope of basic health services covered by this project and sharpened the focus of its
activities to “reduce maternal and under-five mortality rate.”

Sub-Component 1.1: Improving the Quality of Existing Primary Health Care
Services. Before the First Restructuring the programs for procurement of medical
supplies for health facilities, and for the training of primary health care workers and for
midwife refresher courses were started. The rehabilitation of primary health care
facilities was also started but in the Final Project Proposal most construction costs were
included in Component 2. These activities were relevant to the project’s objectives of
improving access to primary health care.



30
  These are the four target states. Some activities in North Kordofan which were added during the Fourth
Restructuring will be mentioned separately.

   •    Annex Table 2B shows the achievements in terms of numbers of health care

       satisfactory performance.

Sub-Component 1.2: Expansion of Coverage of Primary Health Care Services and
High-Impact Interventions in Un-Served Areas. During the first two years of project
implementation this sub-component financed the purchase of 179,000 insecticide treated
bed nets to 100,621 households in the four states implying just under 2 bed nets per
household and, assuming 6 member households, the program would have potentially
benefitted some 603,700 people predominantly in rural areas. This program was
discontinued after the First Restructuring. It is relevant to note that UN agencies such as
UNICEF distributed malaria bed nets.

Before the First Restructuring the project also supported programs to control a number of
serious diseases prevalent in Sudan such as leishmaniasis, tuberculosis and
schistosomiasis. In South Kordofan the project funded investments to support the
immunization cold chain. The Government’s contribution to this sub-component was
through its policy of providing free basic health services to pregnant women and children
under-five. Until the First Restructuring the project supported the supply of drugs,
medicines and incentives to PHC facilities. This support from the project was
terminated following the First Restructuring in favor of providing more focused primary
health care support.

Re-orientation of priorities in PHC and additional funding in the First Restructuring led
to a major focus on improving the availability of trained midwives. For example it
provided a pilot for performance-based incentive payments for village midwives and a
modest increase in the funding for training of PHC workers and midwives. The
incentive payments were aimed at ensuring that pregnant women had access to a basic
package of quality services during pregnancy and at child birth. Payments were made for
the registration of women in the village who are pregnant, upon completion of the third
ante-natal visit, upon delivery and two post-natal visits, upon notification of the death of
the mother or her neo-natal infant within 40 days if either occurs. Midwives were also
expected to raise awareness of the need for maternal health services in villages and to
keep accurate and systematic records. If all these performance criteria were achieved a
midwife would receive SDG40 per pregnancy which she supported and attended.

The sub-component also financed the purchase of two ambulances – one each for Red
Sea (located at Tokker and observed by ICR mission) and Kassala states (located at
Kassala) where, under the management of the locality governments, they are typically
used to transport patients needing emergency care from rural health centers to state
hospitals. Mobile clinics (four for Blue Nile and one each for the other two states) were
also procured. They provided urgently needed transport for pregnant women referred to
state hospitals for emergency obstetric care.

                                            38
In Blue Nile State the project funded a performance-based contract for 12 months
between the state MoH and an international NGO which led to the provision of basic
health care services for 15,000 returnees from Ethiopia who had been displaced because
of conflict. A final report on this activity was prepared which showed that the contract’s
objectives were achieved. 31

Outputs

     •   Assuming that 70 percent of the population lives in rural areas then the bed net
         distribution covered about one-third of the rural population in the four target
         states. On the basis of the distribution to the target area for distribution a
         coverage was 42 percent was achieved
     •   The provision of additional medical supplies and services to improve primary
         health care services in un-served areas had a positive impact on a wide array of
         diseases during the first two years of the project. Data from DHSDP monitoring
         showed that when these additional supplies were available outpatient attendance
         increased by 30 percent.
     •   Records from the localities which administer the incentive payments for midwives
         showed that, while an increase in the number of midwives was slow the rate of
         increase has accelerated to the extent that by January-April 2013 on average 68
         percent of pregnant women received ante-natal care (an increase of 42 percent
         over the baseline), more than 60 percent of deliveries were assisted by midwives
         in (an increase of 230 percent over the baseline) but with a wide variation
         between states reflecting the conflict in 20111/2012 in Blue Nile and South
         Kordofan (see Annex Table 2E).
     •   In the four target states there has also been a decline in the number of deaths
         notified as a percentage of the reported pregnancies (see Table 3 in the main text).
         However, it has not been possible to attribute the decline in the proportion of
         maternal deaths during child birth to either the increased number of midwives, the
         incentives given to midwives, or to the quality of the primary health care facilities.
     •   Ambulances were an important part of the referral system to ensure access to
         PHC in state hospitals in Red Sea and Kassala if emergencies occurred such as for
         women during delivery. However, mobile clinics were not very successful in
         providing PHC to remote areas because of the poor quality of rural roads in these
         areas. In South Kordofan the ongoing conflict made the use of mobile clinics
         hazardous.

Component 2. Establish the basis for reform and development of a decentralized
health system. This was relevant to the second part of the PDO, namely “establishing
the basis for reform, sustainable financing, and development of the decentralized health
system”. However, a number of activities included in the FPP for this component, such

as the substantial infrastructure construction program, could have more logically been
included in the domain of the first component. This anomaly was addressed to some
extent in the project’s restructuring when sub-components were re-arranged.

Sub-component 2.1. Capacity-Building and Policy Development. Four consultancy
services and studies were planned at appraisal, namely (a) Health Care Financing; (b)
Access to Pharmaceuticals; (c) Health Planning and Budgeting; and (d) Monitoring and
Evaluation. Results of these studies are summarized below. The First Restructuring
added funding for technical support for and supervision of midwives, and a maternal
death audit system. There were also a number of studies financed separately by the
MDTF-NS Technical Secretariat (not financed by the DHSDP) which are listed in Annex
Table 2C.

   (a) Health Care Financing.

   The project commissioned WHO to undertake a Health Financing study. It was
   completed in October 2012 and covered (i) National Health Accounts; (ii) Household
   Health Services Utilization; (iii) Review of the National Health Insurance Fund; (iv)
   Comprehensive PHC package; (v) Cost of the PHC package; (vi) Knowledge,
   Attitudes and Practices (KAP) Study of Household Health Behavior.

        (i) National Health Accounts (NHA). The preparation of the NHA was
        completed using a range of consultants and some additional financing obtained by
        WHO from sources other than the DHSDP. This work delivered health accounts
        for all 15 states and provided the federal MoH with a crucial framework and
        complete data on health expenditures by sources in Sudan.

        Outputs

           •   The NHA has been institutionalized within the Federal Ministry of Health
               with the support of staff training by WHO. The data are regularly
               updated by the Health Economics Unit in the Ministry and used in its
               regular planning and budgeting processes.
           •   The NHA has also provided relevant information to the Fiscal and
               Financial Allocation and Monitoring Commission (FFAMC) which in the
               longer run should provide the basis for sustainable financing of a
               decentralized health system and contribute to more effective central
               government allocations of funds for health care to the states.
           •   The NHA has led to a demand for the generation of sub-accounts for
               various specific Government expenditures such as for malaria prevention
               with implications for facilitating applications for financial assistance from
               the Global Fund.
           •   Another result is that the NHA has led to a health economics course in the
               Economics Faculty in the University of Khartoum.
           •   Overall, the NHA was a significant contribution to health sector reform
    .

               (ii) Household Health Services Utilization Survey (2009). The survey
               was intended to provide data to explore the public’s expenditure patterns for
               health care services. No formal evaluation of the quality of this survey was
               found in the project files.

           Outputs

               •   Results from the survey provided data for the construction of the NHA.
               •   Survey information will be relevant to the National Health Insurance
                   Fund’s future development program. The survey provided important
                   information for the health sector reform program.
               •   The survey results changed the Ministry’s understanding of the structure
                   of health care financing in Sudan and the relatively small importance of
                   the Government’s funding of health care. For example the survey showed
                   that 80 percent of annual health care expenditures by households come
                   from “out of pocket” expenditures. 32

           (iii) Review of the National Health Insurance Fund (NHIF). 33 The National
           Health Policy aims to achieve universal coverage of basic health care to all
           citizens in Sudan through the state health insurance funds (SHIFs). This review
           was aimed at assessing current NHIF coverage in the states and suggesting
           strategies for increasing that coverage.

           Outputs

               •   Four intervention areas were suggested, namely stimulate SHIF incentives
                   to actively pursue increased enrolment, especially in the informal sector,
                   mobilize increased resources for social support, increase access using
                   provider payment mechanisms to increase attractiveness of setting up
                   clinics in under-served areas and to give health care providers an interest
                   in promoting enrolment in health insurance, and develop close-to-client
                   health insurance by expanding the use of delegated collection of
                   contributions and exploring and evaluating the use of mobile phones for
                   payment of contributions and health messages.

               •   The NHIF has taken account of this study in its assessment of future
                   strategies to extend its population coverage in line with the Government’s
                   policies on free health care.

  According to its last Annual Report (December, 2012) the NHIF is currently represented at 1,347 health
care facilities in Sudan including 145 facilities in the four target states in the DHSDP

        (iv) Comprehensive PHC Package. This document starts by defining the
        different levels of primary health care followed by a brief review of the major
        illnesses in Sudan and the main primary health care programs. It then documents
        significant features of primary health care in Sudan based on a Health Facility
        Survey in 2010.

        Outputs

            •   The survey found that almost 40 percent of PHC facilities suffered from a
                shortage of human resources (i.e. qualified staff), only about 60 percent of
                PHC facilities were connected to a source of safe water, and 70 percent of
                PHC facilities had no source of electricity. The bulk of the document is a
                set of tables describing the services theoretically available for certain
                diseases at different types of primary health care facilities.

            •   This document alerted the authorities to the weak overall status of the
                primary health care facilities.

        (v) Cost of the PHC Package. This assessment is being prepared by the federal
        MOH. It has not yet been completed although, apart from providing information
        for budgeting purposes, its potential impact on increased access to PHC is not
        clear.

        (vi) Knowledge, Attitudes and Practices (KAP) in Sudanese Communities for
        their Health Behavior. 34 This study assessed the knowledge, attitudes and
        practices towards selected PHC services in 15 communities which suffered from
        poor living and sanitary conditions, including lack of toilets, and improper solid
        waste and water disposal.

        Output

            •   The study concluded that “the importance of personal hygiene and sanitary
                practices increased significantly with educational level and financial status.
                In addition, health financing is seen by almost all respondents as a burden
                on the family, as out of pocket expenditure was reported to be the main
                source of health financing.”
            •   The study recommended that literacy should be enhanced to boost the
                utilization of health care services, awareness of primary health care and
                services needs to be promoted, regulatory efforts and intervention
                programs should be focused on improving the living conditions of the
                poor and the disadvantaged the location and working hours of PHCs
                should be made more accessible to underserved communities, the capacity

                of referral systems should be improved key media agencies and
                personalities should be trained in primary health care to improve the
                effectiveness of media messages on PHC strategies and action plans.
            •   While health administrators must have been aware of most of these
                recommendations, they served to reinforce the urgency of reform in the
                health sector in order to improve access to PHC services.

     (b) Access to Pharmaceuticals.

This assessment was not completed before the First Restructuring and dropped.

     (c) Health Planning and Budgeting

The FPP proposed that this contract support "Health planning, budgeting and
management in target State and Locality health administrations. Capacity-building and
training would focus on the Ministries of Health in four target states. It was to include
institutional assessments leading to recommendations on organizational reform and
development, and technical assistance and training in planning, budgeting, management
and supervision". These activities were all addressed by the consultant company,
although the attention to these issues at the locality level was modest

Rather than a broad capacity building exercise for improving access to PHC services (as
the FPP had clearly intended) this activity became an exercise in capacity building for
planning - but without much focus on policy formulation although it was “aligned to the
aims of the National Health Policy or to the development objectives of the State
MoHs”. 35

There were many workshops and training sessions, but no specific description of the
content of the training programs in the consultant’s completion report. They were
broadly described as "training in planning through workshops and training sessions at the
federal and state level "and "planning workshops" at the federal and state levels. The
conclusion is that MoH staff and others attending the workshops received training in how
to make plans. As a result the consultant’s completion report is largely about capacity
building for planning and future plans to address those problems and an investment plan
for the state and locality public health institutions. The outcome of the BMB program is
difficult to evaluate, but there were a number of outputs.
Outputs

            •   The analysis and planning under this consultancy culminated in "profiles"
                of the four states’ health status and health care services as well as "state

               investment plans" with budgets attached for a five year program of
               capacity building programs that included capacity building for public
               health staff (achieved mainly in 2011) and a future investment plan for
               activities in each state such as rehabilitation of state and locality health
               sector infrastructure. Presumably the state officials prepared the plans but
               the consultant company did not include them in its completion report.
           •   It is not clear how these investment plans related to the ongoing activities
               in the project or the future plans of the federal and state Ministries of
               Health. For example, were they complementary or additional to the
               investments funded by the DHSDP?
           •   The consultant‘s completion report states that the intention was to
               "formulate detailed investment plans to develop the decentralized health
               system, to enhance PHC services delivery and to provide a model of
               planning-cycle management that can be extended to other Sudanese
               States." If this is a summary of the terms of reference for the consultancy
               then the consultant has achieved that goal, but it does not reflect the
               objective for sub-component 2.1 of the FPP.
           •   The consultant’s completion report provided no information on the quality
               of the training programs – as evaluated either by the trainees or a third
               party. There was also no evidence of what plans were produced or their
               utility.

   (d) Monitoring and Evaluation

The Sudan Household Health Survey (SHHS), conducted in 2006. was implemented by
the Federal Ministry of Health and the Central Bureau of Statistics (CBS) representing
the then Government National Unity (GONU), and the Ministry of Health in Southern
Sudan and the Southern Sudan Commission for Census, Statistics and Evaluation
(SSCCSE).

Outputs

           •   This survey provided a baseline data for some of the project’s intermediate
               and final outcome indicators. However it is necessary for the Government
               to explain why the baseline for the maternal death rate in the table of
               project indicators for 2006 is not the same as the maternal death rate
               shown in the survey results for 2006.

           •   The PIU, the FMoH and the Bank undertook intensive reviews and
               consultations of the appropriate M&E framework for the project.

           •   The FPP for DHSDP included a sub-component for designing a
               comprehensive national M&E system, and to assist four targeted northern
               states in its implementation. A comprehensive review of the M&E system
               was carried out which resulted in the elaboration and adoption of a five-
               year strategy for strengthening M&E, namely the “Results-oriented

               which was formally adopted in August 2009.


Sub-Component 2.2. Developing Primary Health Care Services

Activities proposed were focused on strengthening the competence human resources in
the Ministries of Health and in the locality health offices in the four target states with a
focus on medical technicians, nurses and midwives. These studies are listed in Annex
Table 2C and were completed at a satisfactory standard. The indirect benefits to MoH
staff through participation in a study such as the annual Maternal Death Review are
shown in Annex Table 2F and are likely to have had a substantial impact.

Sub-Component 2.3 Investments

Following the first restructuring nine rural hospitals were to be partially rehabilitated
(maternity ward and surgical unit only), in preference to the rehabilitation of health
centers and basic health units, to support the new focus on reducing maternal death rates
in the four target localities in the four target states. In the event only seven were
rehabilitated (see Annex Table 2B).

Outputs

       •   A consultant civil engineer reviewed the quality of construction financed from
           the additional financing included in the first and fourth restructuring program.
           The review concluded that the “In general the standards being achieved are
           satisfactory” (May 2013 report – as amended).
       •   On the other hand in a report dated March 2012 the Monitoring Agent for the
           MDTF-NS noted that there were a number of deficiencies and defects in
           completed DHSDP civil works which at that time would cost $574,715 to
           remedy. No information was available about whether these deficiencies and
           defects had been addressed before the project closed. The lack of a surgical
           unit at Bados rural hospital in Blue Nile was addressed as part of the Fourth
           Restructuring. Minor issues at other sites have been addressed by the MoH.

Source: PIU in the Federal MoH. a/ A pharmaceutical study planned in the FPP was not implemented
after it was decided to focus the project on maternal death and under-five death rates as part of the First
Restructuring. b/ This study was a compilation of work explained in the text above. c/ WHO secured
additional funds to complete the various components of this study.



The following additional studies related to the DHSDP were conducted under the MDTF-
NS-TS Budget (Bank-administered budget). They contributed to the achievement of
Sub-Component 2.1 of the project.

     a. Funded by the MDTF-N TS Budget for TA/ESW
        • Study on the Impact of Government Decree on Free Health Care for
           Pregnant Women and Children Under 5. Conducted in 2010 with Bank TA,
           final report completed in April 2010. As recommended in the report, the
           Government decided to conduct a one-year pilot under the NHIF. Bank TA
           has been provided to design the pilot, which is expected to start soon.

   •   Health Financing and Service Delivery Study. Conducted in 2010 – data
       collection done together with the PREM-led PETS in the Health Sector – draft
       report completed in Oct 2011. Report was reviewed and a final version
       completed in May 2012. No follow-up due to lack of funding and proximity of
       closing date.

b. Funded by the MDTF-N TS Budget for SPN of the DHSDP
    • Assessment of the Performance of Village Midwives – Blue Nile and
       Kassala States. A comparative study for which data were collected in
       2011 and a final report completed in March 2012.
    • Social Assessment of the Potential of Women’s Groups at Locality Level
       in Supporting the Role and Work Done by Village Midwives. Conducted
       in the first half of 2011, report completed in June 2011. This assessment was
       complementary to the VMWs comparative study. Both studies helped to
       make a few adjustments to the implementation of DHSDP. They were also
       meant to guide the planned “community component” under the second
       Additional Financing, which ended up not being possible because there was
       not enough time to identify a competent National NGO or CBO which could
       be sub-contracted by the project for this specific purpose).
    • Brief Assessment of the First Level Referral System. Conducted in
       October 2012. Report completed at the end May 2012. It included a
       concrete proposal for a “first” level referral component” and estimated costs
       to be included in the Second Additional Financing. It was not implemented
       because the FMOH’s response was not strong enough. There was also
       limited time – only 6 months for implementation of the Second Additional
       Financing
    • Assessment of the Maternal Death Review System. Completed in June
       2013. A task force established by the PHC Department to develop a work
       plan to implement the study’s recommendations

               ANNEX 3. ECONOMIC AND FINANCIAL ANALYSIS

The Final Project Proposal presented an overview of different approaches to an economic
analysis of the project. It described effectiveness of a PHC approach, cost-effectiveness,
cost-benefit analysis, positive externalities, and equity. With respect to financial analysis
it described aggregate health sector expenditure requirements, per capita health
expenditures requirements, federal government health expenditures, functional health
expenditures, state government health expenditures, and international comparisons of
expenditures on health. The material was a review of various measures for estimating the
benefits and costs of improving primary health care.

The review resulted in no conclusions on the likely rate of return from or the economic
efficiency of the DHSDP. It emphasized, however, that international experience with
economic and financial analysis of the efficiency of investments in primary health care
typically shows substantial positive returns.


This annex provides an analysis of the project’s efficiency using the available data.
However it makes no pretense of being comprehensive. Rather it provides an assessment
of managerial and implementation efficiency and an analysis of the cost-effectiveness of
the project’s most important objective of improving reproductive health and improving
access to primary health care in Blue Nile, Kassala and Red Sea states.

Managerial Efficiency

The DHSDP was under the leadership of the FMoH and the SMoHs supported by the
Federal and State PIUs. The continuity of core personnel (mainly at State level) before
and after restructuring was salutory as was fiduciary management. On balance,
management efficiency had moderate shortcomings before restructuring and minor
shortcomings after restructuring when it made good use of earlier technical assistance to
improve institutional capacity.
However the cost of project management was 13 percent of total costs which compares
with the original estimate of 5 percent. The original estimate of management costs might
have been unrealistically low in view of the legacy of conflict and there was indeed more
conflict in Blue Nile and South Kordofan during implementation. While 13 percent is a
high percentage compared with similar projects, it should be acknowledged that Sudan is
a post conflict state where costs of project supervision are known to be relatively high.

Implementation Efficiency.

The Monitoring Agent noted that project implementation improved from its original
weak phase (when implementation efficiency had significant shortcomings) to the final
phase of development (when implementation efficiency had minor shortcomings).




                                             57
After the first restructuring in 2009 the project focused mainly on pursuing the
achievement of the project’s first objective.. All the planned health facilities were either
renovated or constructed, and the total training objectives were achieved with heavy
focus on the training of VMWs. Almost all the implementation targets for either the
renovation or construction of primary health care facilities as well as targets for training
facilities, with heavy focus on the training of village midwives (VMWs), were achieved.
Outpatient consultations per person per year doubled. Reproductive health care (a basic
health care service), as measured by the incidence of both antenatal care and births
attended by skilled health staff, improved during project implementation.

Innovative approaches to improve efficiency involving the organization of midwifery
training in localities close to target communities to overcome traditional constraints on
young female students travelling unaccompanied to main towns contributed to a high
training output and increased the supply of trained midwives in remote villages. The
project effectively achieved its targets. This was a substantial achievement.

However, progress in South Kordofan was set back because of civil conflict, although it
was compensated by the rehabilitation of three village midwife training centers in North
Kordofan.

Cost-Effectiveness
One approach to the assessment of cost effectiveness is to estimate the cost of death and
disease averted. The cost averted is a benefit of a protocol or intervention that is used to
avert a disease. An example of this is the use of “disability-adjusted life years” (DALYs)
averted due to interventions financed by this project. After valuing the DALYs to obtain
an estimate of the benefits from the project they can be compared with the cost of the
project. This approach is used below for three of the four target states. South Kordofan
was excluded because of the substantial interruption to implementation in that state due
to the civil conflict.

DALYs are defined as the sum of the present value of future years of lifetime lost
through premature mortality of patients and the present value of years of a future lifetime
adjusted for the average severity (frequency and intensity) of any mental or physical
disability inflicted on patients by a disease or injury. 36 37

in cost-effectiveness analysis”; Health Policy and Planning; 16(3): 326-331

  The concept of the DALY was first introduced in the World Development Report in 1993 in
collaboration with the World Health Organization.

All symbols have the same meaning in the two equations except that in the second
equation L = duration of disability and D = the disability weight.

Equation 1 generates the number of DALYs averted due to mortality at a specific age.
For the DHSDP it is maternal mortality because activities this project focused on
reducing maternal mortality by providing antenatal care and skilled birth attendants to
pregnant women. Baselines and achievements resulting from these activities in three of
the project’s four target states were provided in Table 4 of the main text. 39 Assumptions
used in calculating the DALYs averted for these activities are provided below.

Antenatal Care (“at least one antenatal consultation”). The baseline of pregnant
women in 2008 who had at least one antenatal consultation was 25,650. This represented
41 percent of the estimated number of pregnant women in the three target states. At the
project’s close the number had increased to 44,771 which was 60 percent of the estimated
number of pregnant women in the three states analyzed here. It is assumed that the
increase in the number of pregnant women seeking antenatal consultations was
attributable to the project. The expected maternal deaths among these women without
the project would be the number of deaths averted because of the antenatal consultations
financed by the project.

Maternal mortality rates have been difficult to measure in Sudan because the majority of
deliveries take place in mothers’ homes and a significant proportion of deaths are not
reported. The official average maternal mortality rate for all Sudan is about 0.7 percent,
but the actual rate is almost certainly much higher in the poor rural localities targeted by

Press; August 1996

  The three states are Blue Nile, Kassala and Red Sea. South Kordofan was excluded because of the
negative impact of the hostilities in that state on project implementation results.


                                                                      59
this project. It is therefore assumed for this analysis that antenatal care averted deaths
among the increased number of pregnant women who sought antenatal care during the
project was 1 percent.

Skilled Health Attendants (“births attended by skilled health staff”). The baseline of
pregnant women in 2008 who had skilled attendants at delivery was 13,358 which
represented 23 percent of the estimated number of women who delivered babies in the
three target states. At the project’s close the number had increased to 33, 249 which was
46 percent of the estimated number of women who delivered babies in the three states.
As argued above, it is assumed for this analysis that the presence of skilled birth
attendants for pregnant women averted deaths among 1 percent of the increased number
of pregnant women who received such support at delivery during the project.

Access to Basic Health Care (“outpatient consultations”). The baseline in 2008 was
353,598 consultations which was 23 percent of the population in the three states. When
the project closed the number of annual consultations had increased to 739,365 which
was 34 percent of the population. The increase of 385,467 consultations is assumed to
have been attributable to the project. It is also assumed that most patients did not have
serious diseases that caused continued disability. In other words they had diseases that
were cured within a year with no significant subsequent disability effect. However,
serious diseases are prevalent in Sudan and particularly in the target localities for this
project. Malaria, for example, is a major problem with an incidence of about 28 percent
in all Sudan 40 and its incidence may be higher in rural areas of Blue Nile State where its
debilitating effects could linger for many years. Nevertheless, malaria and other serious
diseases have been successfully addressed in Sudan in the past and chronic disabilities
have been averted with adequate access to primary health care. It is assumed that this
performance would have continued without the project, but that 1 percent of
consultations funded by DHSDP were serious with the potential for prolonged disability
for patients for an average of 15 years. It is assumed that consultations at primary health
care facilities funded by DHSDP averted these periods of disability. This is possibly a
conservative assumption given the shortage of health professionals in rural area of Sudan.

On the basis of the analytical approach and assumptions outlined above for calculating
YLL for antenatal care and skilled health staff assumptions for equation 1 were as
follows:

K = 1 (implies that each year of life has the same value); C = 0.1658 (standard value for
Global Disease Burden assessments by WHO); r = 0.03 (standard value for Global
Disease Burden assessments by WHO); a = 32 (based on the average age of pregnancy
being between 15 and 49); β = 0.04 (standard value for Global Disease Burden
assessments by WHO); L = life expectancy for women in Sudan at age 32 (i.e. 33 years);

Mortality and Disability Adjusted Life Years”, Malaria Journal; 2007, 6:97


                                                  60
e = 2.72 (an approximation of the value of the natural base); and D = 1 (no disability
factor).

For the purpose of calculating YLD for outpatient consultations all assumptions are the
same as for YLL except that D = 0.2 (disability weight which reflects disabilities caused
by ailments such as congestive heart failure, cataracts, drug use, low vision, malaria,
dengue fever, diphtheria and measles). 41 a = 25 (age of onset of disability); L = 15
(duration of disability in years).

Results of the calculation of DALYs for the three outcome indicators are presented in
Annex Table 3-1 and the calculation of the present values of benefits and costs are shown
in Annex Table 3-2

The overall conclusion on the basis of the assumptions set out above is that the present
value of the disability life years averted valued at the per capita gross national income in
Sudan in 2008 ($1,270) is estimated to be $30.7 million.42 The discounted value of all
project costs is calculated at almost $14 million. In other words for each dollar invested
in the project the benefits from improve reproductive health and increased access to
primary health care alone generated two dollar’s worth of benefits in terms of the effects
of maternal mortality and diseases averted. While many assumptions have been made in
this analysis they have been on the conservative side and the result is therefore robust in
terms of unexpected lower performance parameters. In addition the social benefits of
reduced maternal mortality, less disabilities and illness in the population as a result of
improved access to PHC services have not been assessed. However there can be no
question that the net social benefits of reduced maternal mortality rates and improved
access to PHC are positive and represent additional benefits above those estimated in this
analysis.

   Assessing what Sudan’s per capita income would have been in 2008, without the benefits of the value of
its share of oil exports originating from South Sudan is hazardous. As a proxy it is assumed to be equal to
the current value of Sudan’s per capita income. The estimated per capita income for Sudan in 2008 (which
included South Sudan) in current terms was close to $1,400.

    1. Project overview
Country               Sudan
Project title         Decentralized Health System Development Project (DHSDP)
Project Development   To improve access to basic health services by conflict-affected
Objective             and underserved populations in target states while increasing the
                      capacity of the decentralized health system to establish the basis
                      for health sector reform, sustainable financing, and development.
Sector                Health
Location              Along with some activities at the level of the Federal Ministry of
                      Health, the project targets the conflict-affected and poor states of
                      Southern Kordofan, Blue Nile, Kassala, and Red Sea, covering a
                      population of approximately 5.1 million.         The target states
                      include the Three Areas.
Implementing          Federal Ministry of Health (FMoH) and four State Ministries of
Agency                Health (SMoH)
Implementing          Three phases over a period of 4.5 years (54 months) .Project
Period:               closing date extended to June 2012
Brief Description     Depending on different contexts within each target state, the
                      project supported strategies, sometimes on a pilot basis, for
                      improving access to basic health services by underserved
                      populations, including injecting resources into existing
                      underfinanced public sector health services, reducing financial
                      and social barriers to care, creating mobile and temporary clinics,
                      contracting for-profit and non-profit private organizations and
                      firms to support service delivery, and providing high-impact
                      health interventions directly to households. The project also
                      started investing in key inputs to the PHC system in the four
                      target states, developing state and local health administration
                      capacity, human resources, infrastructure and equipment. At the
                      same time, the project supported technical assistance to improve
                      knowledge and allow the government to assess options for

                                          67
                       addressing important systemic issues, particularly sustainable
                       financing of PHC services under the decentralized system.
                       Special attention was given to building capacities in monitoring
                       and evaluation. Developing the decentralized health system in
                       the target states on a sustainable basis was a long-term endeavor
                       and the project supported the initial steps, through pilot
                       experiences, technical assistance, studies, and capacity-building,
                       in order to lay the groundwork for sector-wide reform. Finally
                       project contributed to reduction of maternal mortality in four
                       targeted states by supporting reproductive health strategies.

   2. Project Context, Development Objectives and Design
1.1 Context at Appraisal
1. Country context: The Government’s vision for the health sector in Sudan- described
by the 25 year Strategy - is to fulfill the MDGs, contribute to poverty reduction, and
improve equity across and within states, and among vulnerable groups. The signing of the
Comprehensive Peace Agreement (CPA) in 2005 has provided unprecedented
opportunities for development initiatives in the country and a Joint Assessment Mission
(JAM) has determined the developmental priorities to be addressed by the country and its
donors. A number of national action plans aimed at promoting the well-being of children
and women in Sudan also existed.
2. In 2005, the context in Sudan was characterized by: (i) a decentralized structure but
with weak institutional arrangements between Federal, State, and Locality levels; and (ii)
a dilapidated and poorly funded health system in need of both policy and structural
reform. The JAM had estimated that additional resources of approximately US$ 215
million would be required annually in 2006-08 to achieve significant progress towards
the MDGs over all of Northern Sudan. The newly signed CPA and the potential for
dramatic growth in Federal Government revenues (based on oil revenues) held the

                                              68
prospect for reversing the deterioration of the PHC system and for financing its
development and expansion, particularly in poor and conflict-affected areas. At the same
time, with significant co-financing by the Government, the DHSDP project itself
represented a mechanism for increasing public financing of basic health services in the
target states
3. Results from the 2006 Sudan Household Survey indicated that progress toward
achievement of the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) was slow: (i) the maternal
mortality ratio was estimated at 1,107 per 100,000 live births (638/100,000 in the
Northern states); (ii) infant mortality was 81/1000 live births (71/1,000 in the Northern
states); and (iii) the under-5 mortality rate was (102/1,000 in the Northern states).
Furthermore, communicable diseases including vaccine preventable constituted a major
burden of disease, and the health system, disrupted after years of conflict, was unable to
provide essential primary health services to the population, especially those vulnerable.
In the four target states of the project, there were large deficiencies in health services, as
staff were poorly allocated, paid and motivated and often have insufficient technical
knowledge and skills, while the supply of pharmaceuticals was uncertain, and basic
equipment was lacking. In many areas of the target states, there was a basic lack of
health facilities and services, with limited support from non-governmental organizations
(NGOs). A social and gender assessment in the target states done as part of project
preparation showed that even in situations where a supply of health services exists, there
are major barriers to access by women, vulnerable groups and the poor in general.
4. The project paper also identified a number of systemic issues, of which the most
important were the following:
   •   Inadequate coverage and inequitably distributed primary health and first level
       referral maternal and neonatal services;
   •   Inadequate availability of health human resource, their weak capacity and
       inequitable distribution between geographical regions;
   •   Poor infrastructure and inadequate supplies and logistics (medical supplies and
       equipment, cold chain, transport and communication) for primary health care
       facilities network.
   •   Low level of spending on health and inefficiency in utilization of available
       resources;
   •   Weak governance and management systems, including the health information and
       health financing, especially at state and locality (district) levels.
1.2 Rationale for MDTF Involvement
5. As specified in the Comprehensive Peace Agreement (CPA), the Multi-Donor Trust
Fund (MDTF) was expected to focus on recovery and development of conflict-affected
regions, particularly the Three Areas (Blue Nile, Southern Kordofan/Nuba Mountains,
and Abyei), as well as the least-developed regions in North Sudan. The proposed project
consequently targets four conflict-affected and poor states, supporting improvement and
expansion in basic health service delivery.
6. At the same time, the National MDTF can be considered as a mechanism to support
policy reform in a context of increased dialogue between the Government and
international partners, in particular with the intention of leveraging growing Government

                                             69
fiscal resources towards pro-poor spending. In this context, the project was intended to
improve knowledge and capacity to lay the groundwork for sustainable financing, reform
and development of the decentralized health care system.
   3. Original Project Development Objectives (PDO) and Key Indicators (as
      approved)
2.1 Project Development Objective (from Project Appraisal Document)
7. To improve access to basic health services by conflict-affected and underserved
populations in four target states while establishing the basis for reform, sustainable
financing, and development of the decentralized health system.

2.2 Revised Project Development Objective
8. The project development objective was not revised.

2.3 Main Beneficiaries and Benefits
9. The project was intended to provide support to the poor, underserved and conflict-
affected states of Southern Kordofan, Blue Nile, Kassala, and Red Sea, which have a total
population of approximately 5.1 million. These states include the Three Areas. Health
indicators in these states, including service utilization and health outcomes, are
consistently lower than overall Northern Sudan averages. Populations expected to benefit
from the project included: 1) poor people living in underserved areas in the target states,
2) populations with little or no access to facility-based health services, with focus on
vulnerable groups 3) Women and children were specifically targeted.

2.5 Original Components
10. The project was designed to include two principal components and seven
subcomponents
Component 1. Expanding access to primary health care services by underserved
populations
11. The objective of this Component is, in the immediate term, to improve access to
primary health care services and high-impact health interventions by conflict-affected and
underserved populations in the target states.
Sub –components:
    • Improvement in the quality of existing primary health care services in under-
       served areas. In underserved areas with some functional government health
       services, the project supports injection of resources into the existing PHC system,
       improving service quality and allowing reductions in consultation fees.
    • Expansion of coverage of primary health care services and high-impact
       interventions in un-served areas. This Sub-component supports expansion of
       basic health services to improve coverage of conflict-affected and un-served areas.
    • Pilot experiences to reduce barriers to access to primary health care services. The
       objective of this Sub-component is to improve the knowledge and experience of
       the health authorities with possible strategies and interventions to reduce barriers
       to access to primary health care services, particularly by women, vulnerable
       groups and the poor in general.

Component 2. Establishing the basis for reform and development of the
decentralized health system
12. The objective of this Component is to increase the capacity of the decentralized
health system to establish the basis for sustainable financing, reform and development.
This involves three Sub-components.
Sub –components:
    • Capacity-building and policy development: the objective of this Sub-component
       is to lay the groundwork for reform and development of the decentralized health
                                           71
       system through technical assistance and studies on priority systemic issues as well
       as capacity-building in selected areas. This is to set the basis for reforms in health
       care financing, access to pharmaceuticals, health planning, budgeting and
       management by target State and Locality health administrations and monitoring
       and evaluation.
   •   Development of primary health care human resources: this Sub-component
       provides support to implementation of the FMoH human resources for health
       (HRH) strategy in the four target states, establishing the basis for improvements
       in the production, quality, deployment and retaining of the PHC workforce. Of
       particular priority are medical technicians, nurses and midwives. The supported
       activities includes: a) development of a national human resources for health
       (HRH) strategy, b) development of state PHC human resource development
       strategies, c) review of curricula and in-service training of instructors,          d)
       rationalization and investment in training schools and equipment.
   •   Investment in primary health care infrastructure and equipment: this Sub-
       component upgrades and expands the PHC infrastructure in the four target states,
       focusing on the areas where the network of health facilities is weakest.
   •   Project implementation: this Sub-component finances the personnel and
       resources necessary to manage the project and coordinate project activities at the
       federal and state levels.

2.6 Revised components:
13. The project was re-structured in 2009, but the project development objective,
components and implementation arrangements remained unchanged.
   4. Key Factors Affecting Implementation and Outcomes
3.1 Project preparation
14. Preparation of the final project paper started in April 2006 and the first thematic
group meeting was held on May 2006. The project preparation involved analytical work,
consultations in each of the states, and national level workshops. The preparation process
was driven by the government's demand and the proposal was developed in consultation
with sector partners; in particular the Health Thematic Group, led by the FMoH, and
included the MDTF donors, UN agencies, the World Bank, and non-governmental sector
partners. The decisions were incorporated into a Project Implementation Plan (PIP). The
project was approved by the MDTF-NS Oversight Committee in October 2006; the
Development Grant agreement was signed in 29th October 2006; and the project became
effective in 24th January 2007, with a closing date of 31 December 2009.
15. The project design was based on a number of studies including the Sudan Household
Health Survey, conducted on 2006 and provided baseline information for the project. A
social and gender analysis was conducted on 2006 to examine and identify the needs of
women and other vulnerable groups, in the context of each of the 4 target states, and
provide community generated suggestions on how the Federal Ministry of Health
(FMoH) and the State Ministry of Health (SMoH) can address these problems through

                                            72
targeted health interventions, in the context of the MDTF Decentralized Health system
Development Project. The project design was also built on the findings of the Country
Economic Memorandum 2003 and the JAM mission report 2005.

3.2 Project design
16. Drawing on experiences from post conflict countries, the initial project sought to
improve access to basic health services in the short term by: (i) providing mobile clinics
and contracting out services to NGOs to bypass public sector capacity constraints; and
(ii) emphasizing high-impact health interventions focused on households. The project
also recognized that: (i) post-conflict situations can provide an opportunity to undertake
reforms which might otherwise be difficult to undertake; and (ii) experience had
demonstrated the need to work in parallel on system development and financing. The
initial project design was an ambitious project with a dual objective attempting to balance
a focus on improving services in conflict-affected areas in the short term with laying the
ground for sustainable financing and development of the health system in the target states
in the medium to long-term. The prospect of growing and significant government health
spending in Sudan was seen as an opportunity to address financing and system
development and reform issues at that point in time.

17. The total proposed project cost was US$ 70 million, of which the Government was
expected to finance US$ 47 million and the MDTF to finance US$ 23 million. The cost
for Phase 1 was estimated at US$ 19 million, of which the Government was expected to
finance US$ 13 million and the MDTF US$ 6 million (Table 2). The project was
anticipated to extend for 4.5 years.

18. The project was restructured starting from January 2010 due to many issues arising
during the first 2 years of implementation. The DHSDP has essentially came to involve
two distinct project phases (i) from 2007-2009, the project represented a broad health
system development agenda that aims at achieving short term objectives of expanding the
health services to underserved communities with strategic objective of establishing a
basis for reform and development of the decentralized health system. (ii) from 2010-
2013, the restructured project focused almost exclusively on supporting the
implementation of the Road Map for Reproductive Health. During the initial project
period, Sudan built on the National Reproductive Health Strategy (2006-10) and adopted
the Road Map for Reducing Maternal and Newborn Mortality in Sudan (2009). The
Road Map provides a comprehensive strategy for the period 2010-15 to reduce the
current levels of maternal and neonatal mortality and morbidity in line with the MDG

                                            73
health objectives. Based on these documents and a concern that the initial project was not
sufficiently focused, a restructuring of the project began in end of 2009. Other changes
accompanied this strategic change: (i) a significant works program at health facility level
was stopped; (ii) the Government financing requirements were relaxed.
19. The restructuring and additional financing has sharpened the focus on improving
basic maternal and child health services in rural areas of the four target states.
Specifically, this involved: (i) supporting the government initiative to provide essential
inputs for basic child health services free-of-charge in targeted health facilities; and (ii)
intensifying investment in training, equipment and inputs to improve maternal and
neonatal health care services in targeted health facilities and communities. The focus on
results in terms of improved health services included implementation through public
sector performance-based contracting strategies and support to improvements in
monitoring and evaluation.
Changes were made to project activities, geographic scope, financing, and key indicators
and targets with focus on the following initiatives:
1. Free health care services. The Government's efforts to provide free health care for
   children under five and for mothers requiring caesarian sections was already a focus
   of the project and had demonstrated results (in terms of increased outpatient
   consultations). Activities included (i) the provision of drugs, laboratory supplies, and
   other consumables; and (ii) the payment of performance incentives for Health Center
   (HC) and Basic Health Unit (BHU) staff in remote areas.
2. Reduction of maternal and child mortality. The Road Map adopted in July 2008
   provides a picture for the current situation that reveals unsatisfactory progress, and a
   detailed approach for the way forward. The focus was on two key areas:
   •   support for the Village Midwives (VMW) in the form of training (basic and
       refresher), supplies and equipment (VMW kits and renewal, consumables, etc.),
       supervision (from the Locality through the Health Visitor and from the SMoH),
       and the payment of performance incentives; and
   •   investments in strengthening the basic and comprehensive emergency obstetric
       capabilities of health facilities and the physicians who staff them.
20. The proposed additional financing was also designed to take advantage of the proven
implementation capacity established at the federal and state levels, building on project
investments to date in order to maximize development impact.
3.3 Project implementation
21. A Federal Project Implementation Unit (FPIU), States Implementation Units (SPIUs)
and a unit at the former SPLM areas were established for the project implementation at
federal and states levels. The SPIUs included one unit in each of the Red Sea, Kassala
and Blue Nile states and two units in South Kordofan. Federal and State MoHs
emphasized that the Project technical work was being done by the relevant departments
and staff of the ministries. In that respect, the PIUs were acting as coordination rather
than implementation units. A Project operational manual which includes M & E,
Financial and procurement systems was operationalized.


                                             74
22. Initial Deposit of funds by the government was satisfactory since the project was not
ready to disburse large amounts of funds. With the growing capacity of the federal and
state project management's ability to absorb the funds, potential achievement of overall
project objectives was undermined by insufficient government funding which posed
significant problems for both the amounts required and the timing. Unsteady flow of
funds from the Government of National Unity (GoNU) negatively affected the
implementation and effectiveness of the signed contract. By 2008, lack of funding has
severely hampered planned activities.
23. In 2008, when Government co-financing was available, the project has operated
effectively. The activities for which funding has been available (both grant and
government), have been implemented satisfactorily. However, these activities constituted
only parts of a broad and ambitious program that has not been fully funded. A QAG
review in 2008 rated project performance as moderately unsatisfactory largely due to the
fact that project design was too broad and ambitious in comparison to the activities that
had received confirmed funding. By the end of 2008, the project was rated as moderately
satisfactory due to successful completion of a number of procurement activities that have
accelerated project implementation as well as receipt of significant government
counterpart funding end-2008. The procurements included bed nets, drugs, medical
supplies, TA and the NHA contract in addition to incentives to health facilities. In
addition, the project was able to demonstrate significant increases in outpatient
consultations by making drugs, consumables, and incentives available to the Health
Centers and Rural Hospitals.
24. Several other problems, linked essentially to the context in the targeted states and the
complexity of the project constrained project implementation. Challenges included:
       1. The landscape for provision of basic services and the need to work in remote
       and often inaccessible areas, the shortage in health workers and the traditional
       and cultural barriers
       2. Contracting NGOs to provide high impact services was only possible in a
       small scale and was constrained by the low capacity of national NGOs.
       3. The major reform and capacity-building efforts proved to be more difficult than
       envisioned and required longer time, Slow policy development process, low
       FMoH and SMoH institutional capacity and slow implementation of the local
       health system plans and formation of locality teams posed additional constraints
       that slowed the health system reform component of the project.
       4. Flare-up of the Conflict again in South Kordofan and Blue Nile states.
25. The project has contracted two international NGOs. The first was GOAL to provide
basic health services for returnees in Kassala State. The contract continued for one year,
until a fixed health facility was established in the area. Another contract was signed with
Save the Children organization to provide basic training for nurses as part of the
Academy of Health Science activities in south Kordofan. International NGOs proved to
have the ability for quick delivery of the services in addition to contributing more
resources for the project. Despite its limited scale, the experience of partnering with
INGOs needs to be explored as an example of a successful Public Private Partnership


                                            75
model that can inform development of service delivery modalities in underserved and
conflict affected regions such as Darfur.
26. In November 2009, the MDTF-NS Oversight Committee approved an additional
grant in the amount of USD 6 million for an 18 month period with the closing date of
June 30, 2011. A work plan for the eighteen month period of the additional financing was
prepared in January 2010. The DHSDP was extended to close on June 2013. The
extension was intended to provide flexibility to the project in disbursing the remaining
funds and in consolidating the project’s achievements, while continuing to address issues
related to sustainability.
27. The DHSDP implementation units at state level remained stable throughout the 6
years of implementation. With very few exceptions (e.g. Kassala), the project officers and
other staff remained the same since the beginning of the project, thus ensuring
institutional memory and consolidation of capacity building. However, at federal level,
with the exception of the Project Coordinator – which remains the same since the
beginning of the project – a high turnover of staff has characterized key positions such as
those of procurement officer, finance management officer and M&E officer. The
concerns were losing institutional memory, the demands of additional training efforts and
delay in implementation of activities.
28. In 2010-2012 the project was consistently showing ratings of moderately satisfactory
to highly satisfactory. DHSDP’s average rating has been ‘Satisfactory’. The best rated
parameters have been Project management and procurement administration, and the
worst rated parameter has been provision of counterpart funds.
29. Implementation of the initiatives to strengthen the health sector was very slow,
affected by FMOH institutional capacity. The initiatives included the NHA and capacity
building on health planning, budgeting, management, M&E and human resource for
health. Implementation was done through the WHO and FMOH planning and health
economic directorates with Bank TA. The documents of the capacity building component
had no clear road map for impregnation. The TA Component report was submitted to the
project by the Consulting firm after a long delay. But the TA provided neither sufficient
quality control for the documents produced nor a clear roadmap to sustain these efforts;
as a result, the feasibility of implementing their approaches and tools on the ground
remained unclear
30. Conflict in South Kordofan and Blue Nile erupted in the middle of the DHSDP
implementation and resulted in suspension of activities in the two states. Many areas and
targeted facilities became inaccessible to supervision. Targets were compensated by
scaling implementation in stable areas/ other states and resuming project activities in the
conflict affected states whenever security situation allowed.
3.4 Monitoring and evaluation
31. Baselines indicators were survey-measured indicators taken from the 2006 Sudan
Household Health Survey. An M&E officer has been appointed by the FMoH and was
producing regular and comprehensive reports. Results chain development and monitoring
framework development were assisted by the bank in early 2008. A number of problems
were encountered in carrying out that exercise: (i) some information expected to be
available through the routine health information system at national level was not; and (ii)

                                            76
target setting was difficult at State level. Reporting of baseline indicators that can be
measured by the state MoHs' routine information systems was identified as an area to
work on. In general, the M&E during the first 3 years lagged with a lack of specific
results.
32. Starting from 2010, the quality of M&E information has improved because of a
number of measures. Each State PIU was responsible for reporting on state-level project
activities and on the state-level achievement of the intermediate outcomes. SPIUs in
collaboration with the state Health Information System (HIS) and RH personnel collect
disaggregated data and analyze it by locality. This information include: 1) essential
information on the total population by locality, from which both the number of expected
pregnant women and the number of households can be calculated. This data provided the
denominators for the key project performance indicators; 2) detailed information in the
targeted localities on the number of outpatient consultations, the number of pregnant
women attending at least one ANC, and the number of births attended by skilled health
staff. This data provided the numerators for the key project performance indicators.
33. The M&E function for DHSDP had always rated as satisfactory since 2008 to MDTF-
N closure on 30 June 2013. Turnover of M&E officers posed a problem and has affected
the quality of reporting. According to the monitoring agency; the State DHSDP offices
were instrumental in collaborating with the SMoH to assure the completeness and quality
of the data from the village midwives and health facilities, while the organization of
regular meetings of SMoH staff, DHSDP personnel, and Bank’s Task Team provided a
forum for effective technical support for M&E, maintaining consistent management of
PDO data, and exchanging views among the project implementers.


3.5 Procurement, Disbursement, and Financial Management
Financial management:
34. The primary responsibility for the management of project funds, including
management of the two accounts, one receiving MDTF funds (Special Account) and the
other receiving Government contributions (Project Account), rested with the Financial
Officer (FO) of the Federal Project Implementation Unit (FPIU) under the overall
supervision of the Project Coordinator. The Federal PIU generates Financial Management
Reports (FMRs) and submits them to the MDTF, FMoH and MoFNE. Accounting
software was made operational. As a result of in-availability of Government funding
2008-2009, there were delays in paying for delivered works and services. After
restructuring of the project, funds were made available for pending payments to
contractors.
35. According to the Monitoring Agency: the financial management rating was
satisfactory in 12 quarters, moderately satisfactory in 9 and only one moderately
unsatisfactory over the life of the project. The change in rating was mainly impacted by
changes in key finance staff and finance managers. The project life cycle has seen four
finance managers with some delays in replacement of finance managers. Financial
reporting has been mostly timely and of good quality, except during transition which also
affected timeliness of some audits. Fixed assets management was not prioritised as a key
financial management issue until much later in the life of the project. As a result, the

                                           77
fixed asset register maintained by the project does not capture all details that are
considered necessary for a proper fixed asset register such as the cost of the assets, serial
numbers of equipment and dates of acquisition.
Procurement:
36. The project employed qualified Procurement Officers to carry out procurement
functions. These Procurement Officers were part of the PIUs (at least one for each PIU).
The ToRs of the PIUs’ Procurement Officers included training MoH staff by working
with them. Upon establishment, the state PIUs were faced by lack of qualified candidates
to work as procurement consultants and the projected has opted to select and then train its
own personnel. It is worth noting that a large part of the important procurements were
handled by the Federal PIU, with the exception of performance-based contracts with the
VMWs, and RHs, as well as for recruitment of site engineers to supervise the civil works,
which were directly handled by the State PIUs. By the end of 2010, procurement system
has successfully complied with all the internal controls, record keeping and
implementation procedures in the agreed provisions of the grant agreement. The project
procurement system has benefited from:
   •   The centralized procurement function with experienced personnel combined with
       early technical assistance and continuing W.Bank support
   •   Close oversight of the civil works component including recruitment of local
       supervisors and periodic assistance (FMoH and W.Bank),
   •   Identification of bottlenecks and prompt remedial actions, comprising regular
       missions and action plans, timely termination of failed contracts and rebidding,
       restructuring of the project to eliminate the co-funding requirement
   •   Biweekly, monthly, quarterly, field, ad hoc monitoring and independent
       procurement review by MA
   5. Assessment of Outcomes
37. A summary of the project achievements has shown that until June 30th, 82% of the
indicators, 78% of the outcome indicators and 85% of the intermediate outcome
indicators were fully achieved.
4.1 Outcome indicators 38. Since the approval of the second Additional Financing in
December 2012, two PDO targets have been modified, namely the births attended by
skilled health staff (from 30% to 55%) and no. of PHC workers trained (from 1,000 to
3,000). The following table presents the revised targets and the project’s results as of
April 30, 2013:

38. Additional details on the key outcome indicators are presented below:
    • Outpatient consultations (OPC): Monthly data from the Health Management
       Information System (HMIS) indicate considerable variability at locality level due
       to: (i) seasonality (particularly in Red Sea State); (ii) the effects of the security
       situation (particularly in Blue Nile State); and (iii) the availability of drugs and
       consumables provided by the project.
    • First antenatal visits (ANC): The rates of first ANC lagged early but have steadily
       (and sometimes sharply) increased over the past year. Since December 2011, first
       ANC has increased from 59% to 68%, due in part to increased coverage in
       Kassala and Red Sea States, resulting from the recruitment of Midwifery School
       graduates by the project (by contracting and incentives) and by the States (through
       the payment of minimal salaries). In addition, Kassala and Red Sea States have
       organized outreach activities, and Red Sea State added Rural Port Sudan Locality
       with its significant population.
    • Assisted delivery by skilled health staff (AD): There a continuous upward trend
       that is generally positive across the states.

         (including midwives) show that this objective has been largely surpassed.
4.2 Intermediate outcome indicators
39. The project has made satisfactory progress on the five intermediate outcome
indicators, which are presented in table 5:

    •     Distribution of Long Lasting Insecticidal Nets (LLIN): 179,100 LLINs were
          distributed during the initial financing (2007-09).
    •     Per capita value of operational support: The per capita value of support to targeted
          health facilities and midwives over the period January 2010-March 2013 has
          averaged US$0.36 per year.
    •     WHO’s final report on the National Health Accounts (NHA) study was submitted
          to the DHSDP in May 2011. Other studies to inform the development of the
          health financing policy are still ongoing with support from other development
          partners.
40. Civil works. Construction/Rehabilitation of 18 PHC facilities was completed during
the first phase of the project. Construction/rehabilitation of 4 midwifery training schools
and upgrading of operating theatres and maternities in 6 rural hospitals was completed
during the 1st additional financing. For the 2nd additional financing, 3 additional
midwifery schools (in North Kordofan State) and 3 rural hospitals (in Blue Nile, Kassala,
and Red Sea States) have been or are being renovated; they are scheduled to be
completed (with one minor exception) by June 30, 2013
41. Maternal death review (MDR) was established to audit maternal death at State and
locality levels to identify exact causes of maternal death, and to measure effectiveness of
interventions aimed at reduction of maternal deaths. The Project has supported the
implementation in the 4 target states by paying operation cost for maternal death
notification and investigation in addition to training of health cadres and community
leaders on reporting and investigation procedures. Recently, the project has assisted the
FMoH to assess the MDR system through a study carried out by an International and
National consultants. The final MDR evaluation report was submitted on June 18, 2013
42. Though not an intermediate outcome, the Maternal Death Reviews carried out by the
target states have become important indicators for the project, providing both explanatory
factors for some of the results and potential impact indicators over time. Annex 2
presents the MDR results to date, while the table below summarizes the overall results:

43. Safe guard was introduced as a package of service in the targeted health facilities. As
of May 2013, the project has: (i) trained 465 (or 139% of planned staff) on proper
environmental health at facility level; (ii) provided protective equipment for health care
workers/ health care facilities; and (iii) installed incinerators for 45 Basic Health Units/
Health Centers and 3 Rural Hospitals (or about 22% of all facilities assisted by the
project).. A bank assessment for MDTF safeguard components has rated the project as
satisfactory.
 44. The National Health Accounts (NHA), developed by the FMoH with technical
support from the WHO, is the country’s first effort and is expected to serve as an
important tool for evidence-based decision making and planning. The report comprises:
(i) the main text; (ii) the household health expenditure and utilization report; (iii) an in-
depth study of national and state public sector health insurance; and (iv) the costing of
targeted subsidies for PHC services.
4.3 Project outputs. Project outputs are summarized by year in Annex 2.
    6. Other - unintended outcomes:
5.1 DHSDP Complementary activities:
45.Integrated within the MoH and implemented through its departments, the project has
contributed to MoH capacity development through:
    •   Attraction of qualified project staff and national and international experts who
        participated in development of local staff through training and transfer of
        knowledge.
    •   Building the Projects and Development Departments at state and national levels in
        terms of physical infrastructure, oversight capacity and establishment of
        guidelines, systems, strategies and curricula. Capacity development included
        areas of procurement and financial management and civil work implementation.
    •   The project has drawn the government attention to a number of important issues
        including environmental and waste management and maternal health issues.
46. Studies have been carried out with the main purpose of providing the FMoH with
evidence for strategy and policy reform. Funding of the studies was mixed: DHSDP
funding (NHA), combined DHSDP and MDTF-National Secretariat funding (Free Health
Care, PER/PETS, and VMW study), and internal W.Bank financing (CSR).
In response to Sudan government request, the bank has supported the following studies,
complementary to the DHSDP: 1) the design, planning and implementation of the free
care initiative in order to enhance its sustainability and impact.2) Technical Assistance to

                                                   81
support the strengthening of the Health Information System (HIS) with a view to
improving results framework in the health sector, and to address the weakness of the
existing Health Information System. The main focus of this TA was to develop a health
sector-wide M&E framework based on the five-year M&E strategy and its state
implementation plans developed earlier as a TA component of DHSDP. 3) Health
Financing & Service Delivery (PER) and Public expenditure tracking survey (PETS)
merged in one study. 4) Evaluation of the village midwife initiative to conduct a
comparative study of various incentive schemes to providing the federal and state level
ministries with detailed information and evidence on VMWs performance-based
arrangements, as well as suggestions for subsequent policy and strategic decisions. 5) a
Health Status Report (the previous one is dated August 2003), to present an overview of
the Health Sector in Sudan, integrate the findings and recommendations of the studies
above, and contribute to the next 5-year strategy.
5.2 Opinion of the DHSDP state level implementers about the project:
47. The project is seen by people involved in implementation as relevant because 1) it
addresses health problems in areas affected by long standing conflict and have seen no or
little health interventions in decades 2) it addresses priority issues and community needs
based on reliable assessments and studies 3) the project is integrated within the ministry
of health plans and implementation structures generating ownership and acceptance.
48. Issues facing implementation included:
   •   Building the locality health system has proved to be a difficult intervention.
       Implementation was slow, suffering from lack of qualified personnel at locality
       level. As a result, the locality health system development has lagged behind,
       affecting overall project achievement and sustainability.
   •   The project was faced by resistance from the local community in some areas,
       which required additional advocacy and trust building efforts from implementers.
       Successful involvement of the local partners including the community has
       contributed to better tailoring of the activities and cascading of the outputs with
       securing additional resources.
   •   Reasons behind stability of SPIUs personnel throughout the project life cycle
       were identified as 1) the clear project objectives, plans and budget 2) feelings of
       contribution and making a difference to the local community 3) relatively good
       financial incentives and career development opportunities

   •   Other challenges included: shortages in human resources which affected
       operationality of rehabilitated /equipped health facilities and weakness of road
       and communication infrastructure.

   7. Post-completion Operation/Next Phase
6.1 Institutional sustainability:
49. FPIU and SPIUs are integrated in MoH. This has contributed to alignment with other
MoH activates, training of MoH staff and intuitional capacity building in terms of
development of management systems, processes and software (examples include

                                             82
procurement and financial management capacities ). State RH programmes represented
key implementers which contributed to strengthening the RH management capacity at
state level. Recruitment of qualified project personnel has contributed additional capacity
building through consultation and transfer of knowledge.

50. The PIUs office spaces are MOH owned facilities. Other project assets will be dealt
with according to the MDTF policy.
Technical sustainability:
51. Many interventions have required preparatory capacity development and policy work
that contributed to the MoH institutional development. Example is the development of
TORS and guidelines for waste management to introduce incinerators, improvement of
the integrated health information system and advocacy for RH interventions.
Financial sustainability:
52. A sustainability framework was prepared where SPIU were requested to identify
potential sources of funds to continue project activities. Currently, the Government has
agreed to allocate 100 million SDG 43 (or US$ 22.7 million at the current exchange rate of
4.4) annually over the period 2012-16 for a national project to develop universal coverage
of the population with an essential package of primary healthcare services. The project is
intended: (i) to expand coverage of a basic package of primary health care services to
achieve the current national and international targets; and (ii) encourage other
development partners to participate in the health sector using the DHSDP experience as a
model.

53. The DHSDP was the first comprehensive health system development project in Sudan
in decades. Building on its experience, the FMOH managed to get GAVI HSS and GF
HSS Grants. GAVI-HSS began in 2008 to support the federal level and all 15 states on
specific issues with a budget of US$ 16.1 million. The Global Fund HSS began in 2009
with a total estimated budget of approximately US$ 30 million over five years. Together,
these three funds share the same development objectives and provide an opportunity for a
coordinated and harmonized approach for: (i) strengthening institutional capacity through
health sector reform and health systems development; and (ii) improving basic health
service delivery. In addition, FMOH has sought to ensure synergy between the three
projects in strengthening health administration at central, state, and locality levels and
developing the capacities of those institutions with special roles in training (Academy of
Health Sciences) or training and research (Public Health Institute) or other areas. FMOH
is also scaling up the implementation skills gained under DHSDP in the areas of
implementation planning, procurement, and financial management to implement the new
funds.




43
  Of which 20 million SDG would be for drugs and consumables to be made available
through NMS.


                                            83
   8. Assessment of Risk to Development Outcome
54. The initial project design was ambitious. Project implementation was challenged by
the weak MoH capacity and inadequate financial resources for the project. To combat this
risk: (i) the project was substantially reduced after 3 years to focus on maternal health; 2)
close supervision and quick implementation of corrective measures, and institutional
capacity building approaches were adopted. Establishment of state project
implementation units (and the stability of project staff since 2007) has contributed to
ensure that project implementation risk remains low.
55. Political instability has been present in Sudan for quite a while. The recent separation
of the South and the continuous conflict in Darfur and the border areas with the South
remains a risk and poses security related problems. The project (which targets also South
Kordofan and Blue Nile States) has adjusted to the insecurity situation, by finding and
implementing alternatives in safe areas in the same states, as well as in other targeted
states (namely the Eastern States of Kassala and Red Sea). Moreover, activities
suspended due to insecurity resumed whenever possible (e.g. in Blue Nile State, most of
the activities suspended in early Sept 2011 due to insecurity have already resumed).
56. Government commitment, the detailed financial sustainability framework prepared by
the project- including a detailed maintenance and running costs related to the project
inputs, and identifying potential funding sources (other than the project) will ensure that
the project achieves its objectives and lays the groundwork for maintaining many (but not
all) of the essential components of the project
   9. Lessons Learned
57. Policy development is more effective when it is integrated into ongoing activities
and when it combines evidence and recommendations with the capacities of the
potential users.
National level investments in policy development (Management capacity building, NHA)
yielded only meager results, but MDTF-funded analysis in specific areas linked to project
implementation (Free Health Care, VMW, MDR, public expenditure review, etc.) were
more likely to advance the policy agenda.
However, implementation of the results of this analysis was often constrained by limited
institutional capacity to advance the reform agenda.
58. Managing Bank and Grantee expectations is essential for effective project design
and implementation.
Although the PDOs were appropriate and the project was justified in addressing service
delivery and policy reform, the initial project, as designed was too ambitious and
complex with respect to both the proposed activities and policies to be developed.
Only when the focus was sharpened, state-level responsibilities made clear, and project
activities designed to promote the existing reproductive health strategy and the road map
for reducing maternal mortality did the project begin to make an impact.
59. Implementation of even a relatively simple project design turns out to be more
complex than initially envisioned.
Improvements in the delivery of services at the community level take place in a complex
environment characterized by three types of issues: (i) community norms and values
(e.g., the preference of women for TBAs and home deliveries, the difficulties of
organizing and financing referrals, etc.); (ii) the individual capabilities and motivations of

                                             84
service providers living and working in the communities; and (iii) health systems
strengthening (e.g., physical and financial accessibility; financing; training and
supervision; organization of supplies and consumables; and monitoring and evaluation of
the impact on the women in the community.
Though the project made progress on several of these issues, it could not address them
all.
60. Comparable combinations of inputs may not have equivalent results.
The combination of training, equipment, consumables, incentives, and supervision, which
contributed to the VMW’s improved performance, was not nearly as successful at the
FHU, FHC, and Rural Hospital levels.
Given that maternal mortality cannot be solved at community level, the correct
combination of inputs for strengthening the health system and improving health service
delivery requires careful additional analysis and appropriate measures.
61. Flexibility was an important contributing factor to the project’s success.
Even after the project was restructured, it continued to adapt to the evolving situation: (i)
midwifery training schools were moved from the capital to the communities to overcome
local resistance to sending females outside the communities; (ii) outreach activities were
organized to compensate for the initially slow production of village midwives; (iii)
support for the Maternal Death Review process; and (iv) waste management was
recognized as a priority with appropriate measures financed in all project sites.
In each case, the measures implemented by the project were rapidly scaled up nationally.
62. Easily measured indicators which are reported regularly are far more useful
than more complex indicators available only periodically.
Comparing the lack of data for monitoring the original grant with the monthly PDO
results for the two additional financings, it’s clear that regular use of available data
allowed for close supervision and supported the project’s flexibility.
63. Project sustainability has both institutional and financial components.
The integration of project coordination within FMoH and SMoH was critical for project
performance during and will be essential for institutional sustainability after project
closing.
Financial sustainability for continuing the project’s benefits will be almost impossible
without a formal and transparent budgeting and disbursement system in the State
Ministries of Health.
