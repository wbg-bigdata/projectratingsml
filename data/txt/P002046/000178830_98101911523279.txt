Office of Director-General                                                    June 29, 1995
Operations Evaluation
MEMORANDUM TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS AND THE PRESIDENT
SUBJECT: Impact Evaluation Report on Nigeria -
Kano and Sokoto Agricultural Development Projects (Loans 1982 & 2185-UNI)
Attached is the Impact Evaluation Report (IER) on the Nigeria-Kano Agricultural
Development project (Loan 1982-UNI, approved in FY81) and the Sokoto Agricultural Development
project (Loan 2185-UNI, approved in FY82) prepared by the Operations Evaluation Department. The
draft report was discussed with the Borrower, and formal comments are not expected.
The projects were among a series of statewide agricultural development projects (ADPs)
aimed at raising the productivity and real incomes of farm families through a coordinated approach to
rural development. The main elements were improved technology (backed by an expanded extension
service), increased supplies of inputs, and infrastructure improvements. However, both projects
contained pilot efforts to increase dry season crop production in small flood plains (fadamas). These
were by far the most successful elements of the projects and were greatly expanded beyond original
plans. The approach is now being repeated in an ongoing National Fadama Development Project.
The Project Completion Reports rated the outcome of both projects as unsatisfactory. The Audit
reaffirmed the PCR outcome rating for the Sokoto ADP, but judged the Kano ADP to have had a
satisfactory outcome in large part because of the performance of the fadama development component.
The impact evaluation focussed particularly on fadama development and is based, in
large part, on a field survey of farmers and pastoralists, and discussions with other well informed local
officials and inhabitants. The field survey shows that without the active efforts of the ADPs in
fostering the development of small-scale irrigation through the introduction of pumps, tubewells, and
washbores (wells drilled using a high pressure stream of water), the scale of dry season production in
the fadamas would have been much smaller. The field survey also indicates that farmers recognize
this contribution and see the ADPs as trustworthy sources of information on agricultural technology
and practices. Data obtained from community leaders and farmers also indicated that these
technologies supported a shift towards greater market orientation of production, which has enabled
farm households to both increase cash incomes and improve food security. In consequence, there has
been a broad improvement in the welfare of the communities that farm the fadamas. Focus group
discussions with women indicated that, although their direct participation in these programs was
modest, they see clear benefits to their families and themselves which they associate with the projects.
The survey confirmed the traditional tension between farmers and pastoralists and
noted that this has been heightened by increased cropping. The findings also showed the significance
of livestock to crop farmers and this, in addition to the importance of greater integration of crops and
livestock as agriculture intensifies, underlines the need for the integration of related public extension
and research activities. This matter is to be a central feature of the proposed Second Agricultural
Technology project, which is national in scope and expected to be approved in FY96.

Preface
Since 1974 the World Bank has assisted with the financing of 17 Agricultural
Development Projects (ADPs) in Nigeria (see Basic Data Sheet, page 13). The first nine
of these were implemented in selected parts of states and were described as 'enclave'
projects. These were followed by five state-wide projects, and finally by three multi-state
projects which are still ongoing. Nine of the enclave projects and three of the state wide
projects have been audited by OED.
This Impact Evaluation Report (IER) covers two of the state wide projects, Kano
State ADP and Sokoto State ADP. It focuses in particular on the activities of these
projects directed at the promotion of small scale irrigation using lift pumps, tubewells and
related technology, in valley bottom areas with shallow water tables. The audit reports
noted the particular success of this activity, which has also been almost uniquely successful
among Bank supported efforts to promote intensified agricultural use of such areas in
West Africa. It was, therefore, considered to be useful to examine in more detail the
impact of these activities, as a guide both to the ongoing projects in Nigeria which are
extending this work, and to future efforts in the wider region to support the development
of this key agricultural resource.
This report is based partly on the PCRs and PARs, the appraisal reports, loan
documents, discussion with Bank staff and with officials of the Federal Ministry of
Agriculture and Natural Resources, the Federal Agricultural Coordinating Unit (FACU)
in Abuja, the Agricultural Projects Monitoring and Evaluation Unit (APMEU) in Kaduna,
and the staffs of the projects. The principal basis of the report is a field survey, conducted
by Dr. Janice Olawoye, of the University of Ibadan, between August and December, 1994.
This survey included individual interviews of farmers, community leaders, ADP officials,
and Fulani herders, and focus group discussions with men and women. The kind
cooperation and valuable assistance provided by all these agencies and individuals is
gratefully acknowledged.
The draft report was discussed with Government and the points raised have
been reflected in the final report. Additional formal comments have not been received.

Executive Summary
Background
1.     The Agricultural Development Projects (ADPs) were initiated in the mid-1970s as
Nigeria's oil production and revenues were rapidly expanding and stimulating rapid urban
growth. At the same time, Government adopted policies which maintained the value of
the Naira at a high level. The potential detrimental impact of these changes on
agricultural production became a cause for concern. The ADPs were designed to increase
crop production through a coordinated approach to rural development. The main
elements were improved technology (and the means to get it to farmers), increased
supplies of farming inputs (especially fertilizer), and extensive infrastructure improvements
(especially rural roads and water supplies).
2.     Initially three pilot, enclave projects were undertaken in the North of the country.
By the late 1970s the initial results were considered sufficiently encouraging to justify
expansion. Accordingly, a series of similar projects, some covering whole states were
prepared. Implementation began in the early 1980s, and lasted through the decade. The
Kano and Sokoto State ADPs were two of this group. Each included four basic
components; farm and crop development (expanded research, extension, and input
supply); infrastructure development (feeder road construction and maintenance, water
supplies, markets and storage facilities); institutional support, establishing project entities
separate from the state agriculture departments; and technical assistance, largely to
manage the new institutions.
3.     The performance of these projects is commonly considered to have been
disappointing. A combined audit of six of them, including Kano and Sokoto, was
conducted in 1993, and concluded that the project targets were unrealistic and based on
unproven technological assumptions, that there was too little emphasis on farmers'
production priorities, and that the institutional structure led to a top-down effort and
overemphasis on physical targets.
4.     However, the audit rated two of the projects, Kano and Bauchi, as successful. A
principal element in this assessment was the increased production engendered in 'fadama'
areas.' Northern Nigeria is a sub-humid to semi-arid region and soil moisture is the
principal constraint on crop production. The projects made available motor pumps at
subsidized prices, and drilled tubewells, which enabled farmers to greatly increase their use
of the surface and groundwater resources, especially for crop production in the dry season.
1. Fadafas are river valley areas which are rasonally flooded or have high water tables for all, or a large part, of the year.

Focus of the Evaluation
5.    The impact evaluation focussed on two projects (Kano and Sokoto State ADPs)
and, because of their conspicuous success, the performance of the fadama development
programs within them. This success stands out in comparison with the bulk of the
activities undertaken by the ADPs, and also with the several other efforts in Bank
financed projects to promote increased production in such valley bottom areas in West
Africa, most of which have not been successful.
6.    The major focus of this study is, therefore, on the economic, agricultural, social
and environmental impacts of the technologies promoted by the ADPs to improve the
land and water management of the fadama areas. Special consideration is given to the
lessons of this experience for the on-going ADP related program in Nigeria (including the
follow-on National Fadama Development Project (NFDP), currently under
implementation) and for the development of fadama type areas elsewhere in West Africa.
Methodology
7.    The principal investigative device was a field survey, carried out in the two states
(in a sample of villages whose farmers cultivated fadama land), between August and
December, 1994. This comprised a purposively selected sample survey of just over 250
farmers, plus interviews with twenty-one community leaders from the survey villages,
sixteen key informants from the ADPs and sixteen Fulani pastoralists. To complement
these interviews, a limited number of focus group discussions were also held separately
with groups of men and women, to identify where there might be gender or status
differences in the responses.
8.    In order to disentangle the various impacts of the project, an assessment was first
made of the extent of the agricultural changes which followed the adoption of pump and
tubewell irrigation in the states. Subsequently, the role of the ADPs in fostering the
adoption of these technologies was determined. In addition, the study assessed the
broader social impact of the technological changes, as perceived by the parties involved,
focussing in particular on the relationship between crop producers and pastoralists, and on
women's perception of the changes and their impact on them.
9.    Economic Rate of Return. Estimation of ex-post rates of return for ADPs has
been hampered by a lack of reliable production data. The combined audit only felt able
to estimate an ERR for Kano State and Bauchi State ADPs, and this by using an indirect
method, based on an estimate of the share of incremental production which could be
attributed to the activities of the ADP. For Kano, the estimated ERR was 38 percent
including fadama cropping, and 16 percent for dryland cropping only. Given the extent of
the background data problems the present study did not attempt a re-estimate, but its
findings broadly confirm the judgment of the earlier audit.
Project Impacts
10.   Agriculture. The projects drilled about 10,000 tubewells, which were made
available to farmers at less than cost, and also sold about 65,000 gasoline powered pumps



17
(and later washbores). Traditionally, many families had cultivated small areas in the
fadamas during the dry season using water drawn manually from shallow wells or streams.
The advent of pumps and tubewells allowed the extraction of greatly increased amounts of
water at modest cost, and it is estimated that, by the end of the projects a total of nearly
100,000 ha are being irrigated, in the two states.
11.    Apart from initially providing price incentives (subsidies) to encourage adoption,
the ADPs made some efforts to promote group ownership of pumps and wells, and they
made available diesel pumps, suitable for group use. Uptake was quite limited until
smaller gasoline pumps, suitable for individual use, were made available. Data from the
survey indicate that very few pumps or tubewells were, or remain, group owned. A key
advantage of the tubewell, pump and washbore technologies is that they are suitable for
ownership and use by an individual farmer.
12.    At first uptake was slow as farmers tended to irrigate low value grain crops,
including supplementary irrigation for rice in the wet season. However, when the
potential for dry season production of vegetables etc. was appreciated, uptake increased
markedly. Improved transport services (in part resulting from project built roads) reduced
the costs of transport from the project areas to the major urban markets of the south, and
dry season fadama production of onions, peppers, garlic and tomatoes became very
profitable (except where localized gluts, especially of tomatoes and other more perishable
items, led to very low prices).
13.    The profitability of dry season irrigation resulted in a rapid expansion in the use of
motorized pumps. Seventy percent of the farmers surveyed for the study in 1994 said that
they used pumps for irrigation, but that less than five percent of them had used pumps ten
years ago. At that time they either used manual methods (the ancient shadouf) or did not
irrigate. As a result, among farmers surveyed, one-third said that dry season cropping is
now their most important source of income, and half said that it was their second most
important income source. There has been a clear switch towards market oriented
production, a parallel increase in the use of cash inputs, and a widening of the range of
products. Sixty percent of the farmers surveyed indicated that ten years ago their most
important crop was a staple, whereas now only 35 percent consider that to be the case.
The expanded product range enhances farmers' ability to spread risks and increases
consumer choice.
14.    General welfare. The local community leaders surveyed indicated that, in their
view, people in their villages are better off today than they were a decade ago as a result
of the dry season cropping. In Sokoto State, where population densities are relatively
low, and access to fadama land is widespread, leaders said that almost all households are
better off as a result of the changes. However, in Kano State, where population densities
are high, and not all families have access to fadama land, benefits were reported to be less
widespread.
15.    A widely noted benefit is in the food supply situation. This has two dimensions.
First, a majority of farmers indicated that they have more food now than before.
Increased fadama cropping has allowed them to increase food production as needed, i.e.
basic food security has improved. Second, people have a better and a wider choice of



18
foods than before the projects (eg. more meat, vegetables etc.), since increased incomes
have given them a greater ability to buy food on a discretionary basis.
16.   Sustainability. The pumps and tubewells supplied by the project are owned and
operated by individual farmers and, with over 50,000 pumps now operating, a thriving
servicing industry has developed to maintain them. The latter has been reinforced by the
fact that farmers now pay the full cost incurred by the ADPs for pumps and tubewells.
Sustainability of this activity is more dependent on the macro-economic environment (i.e.,
the continued availability of fuel and spare parts and maintenance of effective demand for
truck crops) than on any on-farm technical problems.
17.   Environrental Impact. Large dams constructed in Northern Nigeria have had a
demonstrable impact on downstream hydrology with consequent impacts on fish and
wildlife. However, monitoring of environmental indicators under the NFDP has not
indicated any changes which can be linked to wells and surface pumping of water or to
other activities promoted by the ADPs.
Conclusions and Implications
Source of change
18.   The ADPs played a central role in fostering these changes. More than half the
farmers interviewed noted that they obtained their pumps directly through the ADPs. The
remainder purchased them from the local market. Since many ADP pumps were sold to
traders, it is very likely that a significant share of those who purchased from the market, in
fact purchased ADP supplied pumps. The contribution of the ADPs is also illustrated by
the situation in the former Kaduna State (which lies between Kano and Sokoto), where
the ADP only recently developed an effective fadama program, and pump and tubewell
irrigation was estimated to extend to only 11,000 ha in 1994 (i.e. about one-quarter of the
extent in each of the two former states covered in the present study). Moreover, Nigeria
is the only country in West Africa where this technology is being used to any significant
extent. Therefore, it is unlikely that the technology would have been widely adopted
without the initial impetus from the ADPs.
19.   The ADPs also made effective use of TA inputs in this program. The initial pilot
operations drew heavily on Asian experience, and the continued support of experts from
that region was a key factor in the subsequent modifications of the initial approach and in
introducing the washbore technology.
Reasons for Success
20.   Four major factors determined this success: (i) effective demand for the
incremental output; (ii) positive incentives for the adoption of the new technology,
including reduction of crop failure; (iii) the suitability of the technology for use by the
individual farmer (technological divisibilities); and (iv) improvement in the technologies to
enhance their attractiveness to farmers.



19
21.    Of these four factors, the first was probably the most important. The income
elasticity of demand for basic staples, such as sorghum and millet, on which the projects
first concentrated their efforts, is low. Increases in production generally do not permit a
significant increase in income, and local markets may quickly become glutted. On the
other hand, the new fadama technologies permitted farmers to significantly increase their
output of products with high income elasticity of demand and a substantial, and growing,
domestic market. Following substantial improvements in the highway system and
expansion of the transport fleet during the 1970's,the major markets in the south had
become accessible to northern farmers, who received prices which made the new
technology very remunerative. Survey findings on the availability of food indicate that
there was little or no substitutes in production as farmers maintained production of
staples, thus increasing both the gross value of output and food security.
22.   Implications. Whether the project designers can be credited with this success or
whether it is mostly attributable to fortuitous circumstances is uncertain. There has been
much discussion over the need for technologies to be carefully targeted to areas where the
preconditions for intensification exist. However, there is a considerable element of chance
in forecasting whether a particular technology will be attractive to farmers, especially
under conditions of economic uncertainty and change typical of SSA. Therefore, too
great an emphasis on picking winners may not be desirable. For extension and technology
related operations such as the ADPs this general proposition has two implications:
(i)    introduction of technologies should be viewed with a broad perspective as
it is difficult to assess precisely where success is likely to arise 5 - '0 years in advance, and
adequate emphasis should be given to technology which would enable farmers to expand
production of products with a high income elasticity of demand, as well as basic staples;
and
(ii)   organizations should be agile and have an ability to follow up on success,
and to modify technologies to increase their suitability for those interested, when
promising conditions are met, as has been the case in the fadama program studied here.
23.    Rapid inflation in Nigeria and the resulting pressure on the budget, prompts
questions about the sustainability of frequent village visits hy a large number of Village
Extension Agents (VEAs) inherent in the T&V extension system. The farmers surveyed
for this study indicated that they look to a variety of sources for information on
agricultural problems, including the mass media, although they viewed the ADP extension
agent as the most trustworthy. The ADPs do contribute significantly to radio and other
media programming on agriculture. More than 40 percent of the farmers interviewed
reported that they saw the VEA every two weeks or more, while a quarter reported no
contact. At this stage, quality of interaction is perhaps more important than quantity.
Accordingly, there may be scope for reducing coverage of the system at the farm level in
some areas, most likely by reducing the frequency of agent/farmer contact and focussing
more on 'problem solving' than 'message delivery'. However, this would create a need to
increase the focus at the level above the field worker-the subject matter specialist. This
is the point at which modifications to the 'messages' are formulated as technologies are
adapted, as was a feature in the fadama program.



20
Livestock
24.    The Kano and Sokoto ADPs did not include components related to livestock.
This appears to have been an important omission:
(a)    relations between the pastoral Fulani and crop producers are the major
social issue resulting from greater use of fadama land for crop production. The presence
of components directed towards livestock might have helped the projects improve their
contacts with the Fulani, and, perhaps act, as one channel for reducing the levels of
friction which have arisen. The interviews showed that the Fulani do not see the ADPs as
having any benefits for them and, in fact, they see the structure and focus of the ADPs as
just one more indication that Government etc. consider their problems to be of little
consequence.
(b)    the primary issue in these states is the intensification of agriculture. The
keys to this are methods to maintain soil nutrient status and improve soil structure. An
important element in this process is the ability to recycle organic matter, a process in
which increased use of livestock has usually been an important factor.
(c)    there is considerable interest in livestock among farmers. A large majority
of both farmers and Fulani interviewed indicated that they had increased their numbers of
animals over the past decade.
(d)    under most conditions in low-income societies suc[ as Nigeria, there is a
high income elasticity of demand for livestock products, so that they represent an area of
market opportunity as the economy grows; and
(e)    animal traction is still attractive as a means of increasing productivity per
man hour, even if crop yields do not increase.
25.    At present, with veterinary services (the area of greatest interest to the Fulani)
being provided by a different service, there is no one part of the bureaucracy th:it   ;
form a bridge between the major groups involved, and foster greater integration ot
livestock and cropping. A small pilot operation has been iitiated by the ongoing Bank
funded Livestock Project, which is channeling support to the Fulani through the ADP
structure. The results of this study strongly support this initiative which, if expanded,
would increase the opportunities and incentives for livestock and crop research and
extension staff to work together. This would also have the advantage of facilitating the
development of 'packages' etc. in support of the development of mixed farming systems
(eg. development of fodder crops and use of residues). Such efforts to integrate extension
activities are to be expanded in the proposed Second Agricultural Technology Support
Project.
Women
26.    The ADPs did not provide assistance targeted to women and there was no direct
contact.  Women have benefitted from increased dry season farming on fadarna lands in a
number of direct and indirect ways. Gender roles in agricultural activities vary but, in



21
general, women's direct role in the field is limited, whereas they are heavily involved in
food processing and preparation for market. Interviews in focus group discussions
indicated that the ADPs have increased their husband's farming productivity, brought
more money into the community, and increased the demand for fadama land. Particularly
for women who own land there are increased opportunities for renting it to others. At
the same time, while rural women's workload may have increased, the benefits justify the
extra effort. For the family, as well as for their own incomes, women felt that the changes
they associated with the ADP had been positive, even if they had not been directed at
them.
27.   The technologies, which have been introduced by the ADPs, were developed
without the priorities of women or the internal needs of the households in the project
areas in mind. For example, many women engage in food processing for sale and make
more money from their trade now that fadama farmers have more money to spend, but
little ADP attention has been paid to this stage in the food chain. Given the nature of
the social setting, the creation of the Women in Agriculture (WIA) program under the
ADPs was desirable. This should help to develop a dialogue with women's groups so that
their perspective can be considered as new technologies are developed and refined,
particularly in areas such as post harvest processing and marketing, where women are
predominant. There may also be greater scope for group operated pumps and tubewells
among women than men.
Improved Farmer Involvement
28.   One impression left with those who conducted the interviews and group
discussions for this study was that the individual farmers and even the community leaders
were not clear as to the goals, objectives and operations of the ADPs. A "take-it-or-leave-
it" attitude was often associated with the ADP packages, particularly in the case of the
moddls, prices and repayment conditions for pumps and there may be little real 'two-way
communication' with farmers. Input from farmer representatives when programs are being
designed may not be apparent to the average farmer, especially if the emphasis of
extension is on disseminating messages rather than solving problems. Because of this
farmers sometimes wondered about how policies on input distribution and selection of
inputs were made, feeling they had little control aside from deciding whether, as
individuals, they would adopt or not. Selection of contact farmers and early beneficiaries
has not always identified local opinion leaders, reducing the ability of the contact farmers
to mobilize and influence others.
29.   Fadama Users Associations (FUAs).  The ongoing NFDP is organizing Fadama
Users' Associations (FUAs) to serve as a link between ADPs etc. and farmers. Certainly
there are some advantages to the ADPs in dealing with farmers as groups rather than
individuals, particularly in collecting installment payments on pumps and tubewells.
However, one of the factors which has made pumps and tubewells attractive to farmers is
their suitability for use by individual farmers rather than requiring group operation.
Attempts elsewhere (eg. South Asia, Senegal) to develop 'more efficient' group operated
tubewells or surface sources which required group operation have achieved only limited
success.



22
30.   It may be advisable not to push the formal aspects of group organizations too far
until there is a clearer perception by the farmers that individual benefits could result from
group action.  Holdings are becoming increasingly fragmented and this will change the
profitability of owning pumps and of the irrigation assets. So, more sharing and hiring of
pumps, tubewells and washbores should be encouraged, without disrupting individual
ownership and control. Also, since many of the aquifers being used are relatively small,
there will have to be some action to monitor and manage the available supply, which will
also require collaboration among affected farmers. However, it may take a little more
experience with dry season cropping for some of these issues to be come more apparent.
On the other hand, if in the meantime farmers are pushed into groups for purposes which
do not reflect their priorities, this may make group efforts harder to achieve in the long
run.
Program Funding
31.   The reality of escalating costs in Nigeria raises serious concerns as to the
sustainability of the present ADP packages. The findings of the study, especially on the
desirability of a broad approach to agricultural innovation and technologies (eg. including
the desirability of including some livestock services) also raise some issues as to the effects
of heavy reliance on external funding and its packaging. Given the scarcity of domestic
funds, the approach of focussing external funding on clearly defined, subsectoral packages,
eg. the NFDP, runs a risk of reducing the ability of the extension and research systems to
adopt a broad approach, and to respond flexibly to new opportunities, in the way that the
Kano and Sokoto Projects were able to respond to the rapid growth in demand for pumps
and tubewells. There is also the danger, pointed out frequently regarding the external
funding of research, that the perceived priorities of those providing the finance may
dominate the priorities of the ultimate beneficiaries.



23
1. Background
A. Historical Context of the Agricultural Development Projects (ADPs)
1.1    By the late 1970s, there were increasing concerns in Nigeria over the apparent
stagnation of agricultural production, which was occurring despite the country's agro-
ecological potential and diversity, the economic resources available for development from
earnings from the oil sector, and a large human resource base. "Since 1970, agricultural
production has stagnated, with annual growth rates (below I percent) less than half the
population growth. Domestic food prices have risen, agricultural exports have declined
and imports of food rose fifteenfold between 1970 and 1978. Imports of food represented
6.8 percent of gross calorie supply in 1976, and are estimated to rise to 15 percent in
1980. If present trends continue, imports will contribute 24 percent of gross supply by
1985. Inflation for food commodities has been running at about 25 percent per year-
significantly higher than for the economy as a whole .... At the same time, production is
overwhelmingly by smallholders, using traditional, manual technology" (World Bank, 1981;
2: and 1982; 1).
1.2    The Federal Government of Nigeria (FGN) tried a number of agricultural and
rural development schemes to increase agricultural productivity, as well as improve the
standard of living for rural people. Among these strategies, focussed primarily upon
smallholders, were Operation Feed the Nation (OFN), and the National Accelerated Food
Production Program (NAFPP). Such schemes were generally poorly coordinated, lacking
the institutional capacity to deliver extension and input supply services to small-scale
farmers spread nationwide, many residing in remote, inaccessible villages.
1.3    Against this general framework of poor performance, three main sets of constraints
to agricultural development were identified:
a) the generation and diffusion of information on improved technology:
b) the supply of productive inputs: and
c) feeder road links from farm to market.
1.4    More specifically, it was recognized that:
"Agricultural research has been inadequate, in some parts of the country non-
existent, and has often failed to address farmers' most pressing problems. Links
between research and the extension services (divided between States and Local
Development Councils) have been weak, short of trained manpower and often
lacking in vigorous direction and coordination" (World Bank, 1981).



24
1.5    Drawing on experience in East Africa, particularly in Malawi, the Bank proposed a
focussed approach within defined areas, with the aim of tackling the constraints noted
above. This was tested in three specific areas in agro-ecologically favorable regions of the
north, one of which (Gusau), was in Sokoto State. The approach focused on simple
improved packages for some of the major food crops such as maize, sorghum and millet,
combined with improvements in the extension services, input supply system, rural road
network and village water supply. Semi-autonomous organizations (referred to as Project
management Units - PMUs) were created to manage these operations.
B. Summary of ADP Performance
1.6    Based on the apparent success of this first effort, FGN and the Bank moved
quickly to replicate this approach on a larger scale. Several state wide projects were
initiated, including in Kano and Sokoto States. The most systematic review of these
projects was undertaken in 1992-1993, when a 'cluster audit' was undertaken of five ADP
projects and a related support project, all approved between 1979 and 1982.
1.7    All of these projects got off to a slow start, initially due to delays in recruitment of
staff, both Nigerian and expatriate, and later because of FGN budget constraints, as oil
revenues fell in the mid-eighties. Overall, the available statistics show that there was little
increase in total agricultural production in each of the five ADPs examined and that
production was far below appraisal expectations. Some rainfed crops in specific states did
show a rising trend for yields, while others showed downward trend lines. None of the
projects achieved its quantitative and qualitative objectives.
1.8    The technology development and transfer components developed only slowly. The
support from research to extension was less than envisaged. Early concentration on sole
cropping limited the applicability of many of the trial results, as the vast majority of
smallholders used mixed/relay cropping systems as a risk avoidance strategy, and were also
conservative in their use of cash inputs.
1.9    The purely technical, and largely sole crop production focus of the initial projects
also helps explain the absence of sound farming systems analysis as well as the lack of
research on incipient pest and disease problems associated with both the traditional
mixed/relay and fadama cropping systems. It took some time also to implement the T & V
extension system and, even where it was introduced, staff suffered from inadequate
mobility. The process of developing recommendations remained relatively 'top-down' in
nature, as opposed to responding to farmers socio-economic conditions and attitudes to
investment.  The generally poor performance of the rainfed crops is consistent with the
difficulties referred to earlier concerning technology development, transfer and service
programs of the ADPs.
1.10   The most successful element of the program was the support provided to 'fadama
development' in the northern projects, that is the use of river valley areas having
accessible water supplies in the dry season, either from surface or shallow ground water
sources (see Box 1.1). The ADPs sold small pumps and drilled shallow tubewells at
subsidized prices, which were primarily used to increase production of vegetables and
other cash crops in the dry season. Although the area under fadama cultivation in the



25
northern projects is small in relation to rainfed crops, its economic importance was
increased because of the high value crops (dominated by tomato, onions and garlic) and its
production intensity, which created additional employment.
1.11   The Kano and Bauchi projects, both in the north, were judged satisfactory by the
audit. A major element in this judgement was the increased production from the fadama
development activities. The remaining projects, including Sokoto, were considered
unsatisfactory.
1.12   The audit concluded that "there were major shortcomings in the ADP design:
-     unjustified, overly optimistic production targets in the agricultural
development programs;
-     unproven or inappropriate technology assumptions, and a disregard for the
farmers' perspective in projecting technology adoption;
-     little regard to the socio-organizational aspects of rural development; and
-     overemphasis on physical implementation rather than on establishment of
sustainable development and service mechanisms."
1.13   "These weaknesses in ADP design and planning are likely to have been partly
caused by the haste in initiating new projects after the first generation of northern enclave
projects were coming to an end. A model was imposed which simply continued and
expanded the earlier ADP model. Insufficient consideration was given to the implications
of the large increase ii scale of such a capital, management and service intensive system,
often to be implemented in a less favorable production environment than existed in the
smaller enclaves."
C. The Significance of These Results
1.14   The apparently positive results of the fadama development components of the
Kano, Sokoto and Bauchi projects stood out, not only in the context of the A1DP program
in Nigeria, but also in the context of agricultural projects financed by the Bank in the
West African region as a whole. A review of the Project Completion Reports (PCRs) for
Bank/IDA financed agricultural projects in Western Africa, completed up to 1994,
indicated that just over 25 percent of them had components designed to support
development of fadama type land. These areas have been seen as having a significant role
in intensifying agriculture since, because of water availability, some of the standard
concerns about short fallow periods do not apply.



26
Box 1.1: What is 'Fadama'
"Fadama" is a Hausa word that has become commonly used to refer to
seasonally damp or flooded land in small depressions with moisture or water
available through flooding, ground water pumping or surface lifting' or otherwise
simply inland valleys" (Babura, 1993: 24).
Scoones (1992: 3) gives a more detailed functional analysis of the
agricultural importance of what he refers to as "valleybottomland wetlands":
- "Areas that act as drainage pathways or sinks for the surrounding dryland
catchments;
- Areas with higher levels of soil moisture than the surrounding topland
during the dry season and in droughts;
- Depositional areas where organic matter and soil nutrients accumulate,
making the soil heavier and richer than the surrounding topland;
- Areas with higher per area grassland or crop productivity, although not
necessarily higher returns to labour than topland areas;
- Areas that are generally small in relation to overall available area, but
have the potential for extended seasonal use and provide the opportunity
for diverse usage;
- Areas that are often key components in sustaining rural livelihoods, both
in agricultural and pastoral systems, as complements to topland, dryland
use".
The characteristics of 'fadama' areas and the environmental and other
problems which have been raised by their increasing use are discussed in greater
detail in Annex 1.
1.15   The review of PCRs indicated that, in most of the projects the 'fadama
development' element was relatively small, and frequently the data recorded on the
achievements of the effort were very limited (see Annex 2). Overall, data in the PCRs
indicated that 29 percent of the efforts might be considered successful (achieved 80
percent or more of their physical targets by closing), 24 percent were partially successful
(50-79 percent), and 47 percent were unsuccessful (less than 50 percent of targets
achieved). However, these figures may overstate the results of these activities. There is
anecdotal evidence, for example, that a significant proportion of the areas developed in



27
several of these projects have been largely abandoned after the completion of the project,
and the reduction of the support to the users which they had enjoyed during the project
period.
1.16  In fact, the fadama development efforts of the Northern Nigerian ADPs are the
single most successful effort to support intensification of agriculture in valley bottom areas
in West Africa. This success has been followed up with the National Fadama
Development Project (NFDP) approved in 1993, which is currently under implementation.
It was, therefore, felt to be useful to examine in more detail the performance of two of
the ADPs, focussing in particular on the fadama development components, both
specifically as an aid to the ongoing project, but also to assess the results of the ADP
activities in this field as a guide to future efforts to support the development of this key
agricultural resource in the region.
D. The Context of the Analysis
1.17  In assessing the impact of these projects, one should review the situation in which
they were implemented. That is, whether they fitted into the changes which were already
occurring within the society and economy, and whether they helped move them more
quickly in a desirable direction.
1.18   During the 1970s and 1980s, Nigeria was profoundly affected by the 'oil boom and
bust'. The initial combination of increased output and high prices lead to an
unprecedented flow of funds into the country, primarily to the Federal Government.
Much of these funds were poorly used, but this flow was significant for the ADPs. They
were launched on the back of the high real oil prices of the 1980s, and faced tightening
local fund availabilities as the real price of oil fell through the 1980s.
1. 19   Less directly, major public investment programs in trunk highways and irrigation
were also initiated in the late 1970s. The trunk highway improvements increased the
access of the northern states to the markets of the main urban centers of the south.
Irrigation schemes were, in some areas, an impetus to the changes in fadama use
supported by the projects, as dam construction and diversion of water reduced downstream
floods and in other ways impacted the hydrology of the floodplains, to the detriment of
some of the downstream cropping, which used traditional water management systems.
1.20   With population growing rapidly (about 3 percent per year), the oil boom also
resulted in substantial rural-urban population movement and increased 'non-farm' demand
for food and other local agricultural products. At the same time a 'strong' Naira turned
the terms of trade against domestic agricultural producers vis-a-vis imported goods.
1.21   In this context, with increased populations attempting to use land for agricultural
and related purposes, and with growing domestic demand for food the primary objectives
for the agricultural sector and for the projects were to increase agricultural production in
a sustainable manner, i.e. to promote change which would assist in the evolution of more
intensive, sustainable farming systems. The primary issue for the present evaluation is,
therefore, an assessment of the impact of the projects on this broad process of change in
the sector and region.



28
1.22   Much has been written on how production systems evolve in response to
increasing population pressure on a limited land base. Increases in population require,
and stimulate, increased food production. This is achieved either by extensification (i.e.,
by increasing the area 'farmed' [that is, cultivated on more than an occasional, random
basis]), or by 'intensification' (i.e., increasing the intensity with which a particular land is
cultivated). When land is relatively abundant, increased production is most commonly
achieved by extensification, extending existing systems to more land with minimal
modifications.
1.23   As this becomes more difficult (e.g., the new areas have poor soils or receive more
little rainfall) changes are made to existing production systems to achieve some
intensification (e.g., fallow periods are reduced). The greater cultivation requirements of
more intensified cropping may also lead to the adoption of animal, or even mechanical,
traction.
1.24   Cropping on the 'fadama' lands has elements of both extensification and
intensification. In part it is a process of bringing land into a cropping system which was
not used for this purpose before. When additional inputs are used (e.g.,to manage water
so as to allow continuous cropping or even double cropping), there is intensification. One
element of the controversy over the use of these lands relates to the effect of increased
cropping on the agroecosystem as a whole (see Annex 1). Several authors have pointed
out that they have traditionally been used by pastoralists for grazing purposes in the dry
season, and have been described by some as 'key resources' in the management of semi-
arid and savannah regions of sub-Saharan Africa (Scoones, 1991). Increased cultivation of
these areas robs the pastoralists of the use of grazing at the most difficult time of the year.
As a result, conflicts have arisen, sometimes escalating into violence, between pastoralists
and cultivators. Other concerns have been raised over the impact on river flow of the use
of water in these areas for irrigation and related purposes, and on those ecosystems which
depend upon it. For example, the Hadejia wetlands in north-east Nigeria, which
traditionally have been used for fishing and are a 'winter' home for migratory birds from
Europe, have been an object of particular concern. In consequence, some have claimed
that the benefits obtained by non-crop users, especially in dry season grazing by
pastoralists, and in fishing, hunting, and related wildlife values, are greater than the
cropping benefits obtained. This issue, however, is beyond the scope of the present,
limited study.
1.25   As intensification proceeds, indigenous resource tenure systems evolve in response
to changing factor scarcities. Communal land tenure is common when land is abundant,
especially where shifting forms of use are practiced. As intensification proceeds,
individuals have to apply greater resources to maintaining the productivity of the land and
become more concerned to ensure rights to its continued use. Individual rights become
more important, in order to allow the individual to modify his pattern of use to meet his
needs and opportunities rather than community norms, e.g., if he decides to grow
vegetables for his brother in the city to retail rather than continue traditional subsistence
production.
1.26   The ADPs have been implemented as this process of the initiation of
intensification in Nigeria was seen as entering a critical phase. Fallow periods were



29
declining and available evidence suggested that yields etc. were not increasing enough to
compensate (para. 1.1). In the more arid north of the country, intensification would
require more effective use of the limited water resources. Since this process was a central
part of the Kano and Sokoto Projects, the major focus of this study was, therefore, on the
economic, agricultural, social and environmental impacts of the technologies promoted by
the ADPs to improve the land and water management of the fadama areas. Particularly,
given the significance of the results obtained in this area, consideration was given to the
potential lessons of this experience for the ADP related program in Nigeria (including the
follow-on National Fadama Development Project (NFDP), currently under
implementation) and also for the development of fadama type areas elsewhere in West
Africa.

2. The Kano and Sokoto ADPs
A. Content and Results
1. Objectives and Major Elements of the Projects
2.1     The primary objectives of both the Kano and Sokoto ADPs,1 as described in their
appraisal reports, were basically the same; that is, to increase agricultural production and
improve farm incomes, and to strengthen state institutions in the agricultural sector,
particularly the Ministries for Agriculture and Natural Resources (MANR) and Rural
Development and Cooperatives (MRDC) in Sokoto State and Rural and Community
Development (MRCD) in Kano State. Kano State ADP was projected to benefit 430,000
farm families cultivating an average 2.8 ha. Sokoto State ADP would similarly assist
482,000 farm families, but with a larger average farm size of 4.0 ha.
2.2     To achieve these primary objectives, each project was proposed to include four
basic components:
a) Farm and Crop Development, designed to increase crop production through
introduction of improved farm practices with more effective research and extension
delivery systems, better farm input supply, enhance farm management capability,
and so on;
b) Infrastructural Development, or Civil Works as it was designated in Kano State,
including the construction of feeder roads and provision of maintenance,
improvement of rural water supplies, improvement of rural markets and rural
storage facilities, and so on;
c) Institutional Support, to develop management, technical and administrative
capability for project staff, improve commercial supply of inputs to farmers, as well
as strengthen farmers cooperatives; and
d) Technical Assistance, through the recruitment of suitable staff and consultant
services when necessary.
1. Tere have been svcral changes in state boundaries in Nigeria over the past two decades. In 1991 both Kano and Sokoto
States were subdivided-Kano into Kano and Jigaws States and Sokoto into Sokoto and Kebbi. In this report Kano State is used
to refer to Kano State a it existed prior to this division (i.e. during almost the entire life of the Kano Agricultural Development
Project (KNADP) and Sokoto also refers to the undivided state, unles specific reference is mnade.



32
2. The Kano Project (KNADP)
2.3    At appraisal, project costs (including contingencies) were estimated at US$482
million, and the Bank loan of US$142 million was to finance 30 percent of project cost
(net of taxes). At completion, 97 percent of the loan (or US$137 million) had been
disbursed by the Bank. In the event, the Bank financed 51 percent of the total
expenditures of about US$270 million. Project implementation was in general marked by
delays, caused mainly by insufficient counterpart funding (aggravated by a declining value
of the Naira), and a change in the political regime in the early days of the project.
2.4    The project surpassed its targets in the development of fadama lands (about 60,000
ha potentially irrigated compared to a target of 40,000 ha), and in the supply of potable
water in rural areas (3,000 wells compared to a target of 2,000). However, road
construction only reached about 60 percent of appraisal targets.  Also, the development
of the agricultural input supply system did not meet expectations. Sales of improved seeds
and agro-chemicals reached only 35 percent and 6 percent of the targets respectively, and
fertilizer distribution averaged 82,000 tons per year, compared to a target of 230,500 tons
per year.
2.5    Project data indicated that only maize and rice production exceeded the growth
rates expected at appraisal. Yields of sorghum and millet increased by 34 and 29 percent
respectively, but the area cropped fell sharply, indicating reduced profitability, and
production was 50 percent below appraisal targets. Groundnut production also declined.
The bright spot was the fadama program, under which about 45,000 small pumps were
sold, and 5,900 tubewells drilled.
2.6    At appraisal the ERR to the project was estimated at 36 percent. No estimate was
made for the PCR as it was considered that available data was insufficient for the purpose.
3. 7he Sokoto Project (SADP)
2.7    This project was very similar to that in Kano. At appraisal project costs were
estimated at US$498 million. The bank loan of US$147 million was to finance 30 percent
of total costs. In the event, project expenditure over eight years, was about US$259
million, of which the loan covered 57 percent. As with Kano, implementation was
handicapped by lack of counterpart funds.
2.8    The results were also similar to those in Kano. The project surpassed its targets in
the fadama program (about 40,000 ha potentially irrigated, compared to 25,000 ha
estimated at appraisal), construction of roads (2,300 km instead of 1,700 km), and in
village water supplies (3,500 wells compared with a target of 1,200). A total of 19,000
small pumps were sold, 4,100 tubewells drilled, and 32 small dams constructed, none of
which had been planned at appraisal).
2.9    Hard data on the production performance of this project was very poor. The PCR
confined itself to noting that "except for the sharp decline in rainfed crops (mainly
sorghum and millet) due to the droughts in 1983 and 1987, the overall impact of the
project on agricultural production was significant, although short of SAR expectations. By



33
project end, SADP had completed the establishment of its extension service, and started
to implement systematically the agricultural research program ..... Monitoring and
evaluation, however, was the weakest part of its management. Data available is
insufficient to carry out a meaningful assessment of project impact on the financial returns
of the producers." No ERR was estimated for the same reason.
4. 7he Audit Estimate of Rate of Return
2.10   The general conclusions of the cluster audit have been noted (paras. 1.13-1.16). In
attempting to assess benefits it came to the conclusion that "the analysis of the economic
impacts of the projects is constrained by the following factors: (a) a lack of reliable
statistical data at the macro, sectoral and project levels; (b) substantial changes in the
general economic environment during the period 1980-1992 (changes in the internal and
external value of the Naira, the employment situation, relative prices and foreign trade
policies); and (c) significant annual variations in agricultural production due to weather
conditions. "
2.11   After reviewing available data, the audit did attempt an economic analysis of the
agricultural impact in two of the ADPs, Bauchi and Kano, where it decided that there was
adequate data to allow for a tentative estimate to be made of the agricultural production
benefits of the two projects. The available data was used to obtain an estimate of the
trend of crop areas and yields for the decade 1982-1991. "Based on these trends, the
corresponding trends of the net production values were calculated (using 1989 prices).
The results were used to divide the total average annual change in the net production
value for each crop into that due to changes in crop areas and in yields. Subjective
estimates were then made of the extent to which these net production values associated
with trend area and yield changes were induced by the project and by exogenous factors."
2.12   On the basis of these estimates, the ERRs of the projects were estimated as 18
percent in Bauchi State and 38 percent for Kano. The audit cautioned that these
estimates should be considered as 'indications' rather than rigorous results. A significant
share of these benefits in both states resulted from the fadama activities. Netting these
benefits out in the same way, the audit obtained estimates for the returns to the rainfed
components of about 10 percent for Bauchi and 16 percent for Kano.
B. The Impact Evaluation
1. Objectives of the Impact Evaluation of Kano and Sokoto ADPs
2.13   Because of the current difficulties of undertaking field surveys in Nigeria (see
below), and the wide range of activities included in the ADPs, it was felt that an impact
evaluation seeking to assess the impact of the ADPs as a whole was not feasible. It was,
therefore, decided to focus on a more limited aspect of the projects. Given the relatively
good performance of the fadama components and the significance of these lands in the
agricultural intensification process, it was decided to focus particularly on them, while also
investigating the farmers' views of the ADPs as a whole, and of their interaction with
them.

2.14   The specific focus of the studies was, therefore, on the economic, agricultural,
social and environmental impacts of the technologies promoted by the ADPs to improve
the land and water management of the fadama areas. Particularly, given the significance
of the results obtained in this area, consideration was given to the potential lessons of this
experience for the ADP-related program in Nigeria (including the follow-on National
Fadama Development Project (NFDP)) and also for the development of fadama type
areas elsewhere in West Africa.
2. Approach
2.15   Based on the study objective and the various factors and actors identified as
important to understanding the impact of the ADPs upon fadama development in Kano
and Sokoto States, a multi-method approach was adopted, combining the use of both
quantitative and qualitative, as well as primary and secondary, data. The field survey
methods used in the study are summarized in Table 2.1 and described in Annex 3.

Farmers
2.16   As noted (para. 2.10), significant data problems have dogged attempts to
determine the production impact of the ADPs and other projects. Analysis has shown
that the economic rate of return to investments, pumps and tubewells in Northern Nigeria
is sufficient to justify them (para. 3.48) and that their use is financially attractive to
farmers under 'normal' conditions (para. 3.49). This study did not attempt to reassess



35
these conclusions, but rather to investigate in greater detail the changes in agricultural
practices and production made by farmers following introduction of pumps, tubewells and
washbores. It assessed the importance of the ADPs in fostering these and related
technologies and to make the changes possible. A major focus of the study was on
broader social and welfare impacts of these changes, as perceived by the beneficiary
farmers and related groups (sometimes the same people) eg. community leaders, women
and pastoralists.
2.17   The field survey was hampered by several unusual circumstances which conspired
to delay its completion and analysis. These included ongoing political instability, which
culminated in strikes, especially in the oil industry, which in turn caused a fuel crisis and
made fuel supplies erratic in quantity and quality. Universities were closed for much of
the period, but opened or closed at short notice, disrupting work programs of the senior
researchers and field enumerators. Random and frequent power cuts and breakdowns in
telecommunications also hampered the management of the field work, as well as data
analysis and report preparation. Also, unusually heavy rainfall in Northern Nigeria
resulted in extensive flooding in late 1994, and a few areas which were initially selected
could not be visited at the time planned, and some had to be left out altogether due to
inaccessibility. Nevertheless, the team was able to visit and gather data from a wide range
of areas, covering an adequate cross-section of the population.
C. The ADP Programs
1. Institutional Strengthening
2.18   Both Sokoto and Kano ADPs formed a unit for fadama development after
realizing their great potential for increasing agricultural production. In Sokoto ADP, this
unit was first established in 1984. In Kano State, the Land Use Planning Department
included fadama and rural water components prior to 1986. The department was able to
identify and survey about 36,500 ha. of fadama sites. The operation of the department
was in close consultation with the Chief Agricultural Officer (CAO). With the later
employment of an irrigation engineer, a separate unit was formed under the CAO to work
very closely with the Land Use Planning Department (APMEU, 1991). The unit formed
for fadama development, therefore, had close connections with three departments:
Engineering, Agricultural Services and Land Use Planning, resulting in some confusion for
the implementation staff. The limited staff were placed in the three zones that had a
greater fadama potential. Most of these staff, however, were more involved in tubewell
drilling or irrigation agronomy, than extension.
2.19   Sokoto State MANR established a Farm Training Centre about 13 years ago at
Bunza to further train extension agents for the ADP. After 2 years, the school was
changed to the Fadama Training Centre (FTC) to specifically train EAs to meet the
challenges of the government ban on wheat importation and consequent directive to
produce wheat locally. The FTC has been training 20 EAs each year. The 9 month
course involves seven topics in the syllabus: agronomy, irrigation, survey and land
development, mathematics, mechanization, horticulture and agricultural extension.
Although over 200 EAs drawn from several northern states have been trained in this



36
specialized course for fadama development, no ADP staff that were interviewed in this
study had participated in the program.
2.20   Some of the ADP staff that were interviewed stated that they received additional
in-service training at later periods. In later sections of this report, contact between
farmers and extension staff and the evaluation of ADP performance by both farmers and
staff are presented.
2.21   From most indications, other institutions were not improved through the ADP
program, except that some of their field assignments were taken over by the ADP field
staff. In general, the working relationship between the ADPs and other organizations
such as the state ministries, including MANR and the RBDAs have not been as
harmonious as would have been hoped to promote their mutual benefit.
2. ADP Fadama "Packages"
2.22   The northern states of Nigeria are located in the Sudanian and Sahelian ecological
zones with mainly dry savannah vegetation and a mean annual rainfall of between 400 and
1,000 mm, concentrated in four to five months (May to September). Evaporation and
evapotranspiration in these zones are high. As a result, these states are prone to
moderate to strong drought risks. Vagaries of weather, particularly the timing of rainfall,
limit the profitability of rainfed crops inputs. Consequently, supplementary water is not
only essential for crop production in the dry season, but can also reduce crop risks in the
wet season.
2.23   The first group of enclave ADPs began to address the issue of soil moisture.
Initially, in line with their focus on traditional staple crops, programs focused on upland
conservation by controlling surface runoff during the rainy season and providing measures
for improving the total infiltration and augmenting the soil storage capacity. These
programs of maximizing retention of rainfall for crops did not achieve the best results in
increased crop production. As the State ADPs got underway, technical experts working in
these projects, who were familiar with successful developments in low-cost, simple
technologies for exploiting shallow groundwater developed in fadama type areas in South
Asia, made greater efforts to apply this technology. (Techniques of small-scale irrigation
in fadamas are outlined in Annex 4).
2.24   The projects introduced low cost tubewell drilling and irrigation by pumps into the
traditional fadama farming areas with very encouraging results. Initially farmers were
offered 3" diesel pumps and hand pumps at subsidized prices through farmer's supply
companies (KASCO, FASCO), but these efforts did not achieve the expected results.
ADP staff reported that the farmers did not like the hand pumps because they were too
tedious to operate. The diesel pumps were heavy and too large to be of interest to an
individual farmer. There is also evidence that after sale back-up was poor (see below).
Although there is no direct data from the study on this point, the implication from other
data collected is that, particularly in the early stages of the adoption of the technology,
benefits were uncertain, and farmers were reluctant to make a group commitment to it.



37
2.25   Subsequently, small portable petrol driven pumps were introduced, which could be
owned and operated by individual farmers. These proved very popular and were the basis
of the rapid expansion of the use of fadama land in the dry season. The pumps largely
replaced indigenous water lifting techniques, particularly the shadouf, in areas where the
project was active. The use of the pumps was still largely restricted to conveying water
from the river channel or other water source. At a distance of more than 100 meters
from the source, farmers had difficulty with irrigation.
2.26   The sale of the pumps by the ADP ran into some controversy, however, when it
was discovered that many of the pumps were not purchased or utilized by farmers, but
rather by middle-men who later resold them. In the Eastern Zone of Sokoto, a probe was
conducted into the sale and distribution of irrigation pumps (SARDA, 1986). In 1985, 583
water pumps of 2" and 3" diameter were sold. The project price of N350-N400 was very
attractive compared to the market price of N1,200 for the 3" pump. The result was frantic
buying by farmers and non-farmers alike, and only 58 percent were later found to be
actually in use by the fadama farmers who had purchased them. It was discovered that 24
percent were resold and 16 percent of the pumps could not be traced.2
2.27   A re-appraisal of the irrigation pump scheme in Sokoto indicated that the farmers
were not adequately taught about the proper use of the pumps. It was found that 32
percent of the farmers were not fully informed of the operational details to use their
pumps, while 45 percent got no explanation at all. Most of the farmers were not told of
the capabilities, or optimal use, of the pumps (SARDA, 1986).
2.28   Initially, the success rate of good yielding tubewells (sustained dry season yield of
at least 20 g.p.m.) was less than 50 percent. This was primarily due to inadequate
understanding and definition of the shallow aquifers in the fadamas. It was, therefore,
necessary to undertake detailed hydro-geological surveys to define aquifer characteristics,
including boundaries, more accurately, to improve tubewell success rates. Such surveys
have recently been completed in the states of Bauchi, Jigawa and Kano (1987), Sokoto,
Kebbi and Plateau (1988) and Katsina (1990). Similar surveys are in progress for other
states.
2.29   In order to demonstrate the technology to the skeptical farmers, the early
tubewells were drilled by the ADP at no expense to the farmers. In an evaluation of the
tubewells in the Central Zone of SADP, it was found that over 40 percent of the
successful wells were not in use a year after they had been drilled. The reviewers
concluded that "usage was very low mainly because of poor response and lack of interest
from farmers" (SARDA, 1989: 8). Presumably the low success rate was itself a major
factor. Later, as drilling performance improved and farmer experience accumulated,
farmers in Sokoto State began to request the ADP to drill wells.
2.30   A tubewell kits manufacturing workshop was established at Gusau, Sokoto State,
to promote simplification and local fabrication of tubewell drilling technology. The

supply, but also in other general uses for the engines. Data was not sought on these non-agricultural uses in this study.



38
tubewell drilling kits and technology were made available to many states, including
Kaduna, Benue, Borno and Niger, and also to other countries (Ghana and Niger
Republic). The ADP had 4 mechanical rigs and 9 bailer teams for in-house drilling all
over the state. Tubewell drilling by contract was successfully introduced, generating
interest in commercial tubewell drilling by private entrepreneurs (SADP, n.d.).

3. Agricultural and Economic Impact of Fadama Development
3.1    This chapter, based largely on the data collected in the field survey, reviews the
overall agricultural, and closely related, changes which have occurred during the life of the
projects primarily as a result of the development of fadama land. These changes include
the expansion of dry season farming, changes in farming practices, problems related to the
new technology, the related changes to farming systems, and related activities, such as
marketing.
A. Expansion in Dry Season Fadama Farming
1. Increasing Proportion of Fadama Farmers Practicing Dry Season Cultivation
3.2   Indigenous irrigation on fadama lands has a long history in Northern Nigeria. The
interviews with 21 community leaders indicated that, in 75 percent of the villages surveyed,
there has been dry season farming on fadama land for more than 20 years, and in 30
percent for 50 years or more (Table 3.1).
3.3    The simplest indigenous irrigation method is the bucket-lift system, or "shadour.
According to oral history from rural community leaders, the shadouf method was brought
from the Sudan over a century ago by trans-Saharan traders. While such devices are low
cost and depend mostly on farmer labor for construction and operation, their irrigation
potential is limited to small plots. Water lifting by such devices is laborious and the area
which can be irrigated is limited to about 0.1 ha per shadouf.
3.4    However, while the practice is not new, the proportion of farmers practicing dry
season farming on fadama lands before 1974 (20 years ago) was generally quite small. The
local leaders interviewed were asked to estimate how many farmers cultivated their fadama
land in the dry season before 1974 compared to 10 years ago and the present time. In
Sokoto State, several leaders stated that only about 5-10 percent of the rural households
were cultivating their fadama lands in the dry season 20 or more years ago, although all
the villages sampled had some in use at that time. Now nearly all farmers are involved.
However, in Kano, although fewer villages were cultivating these lands 20 years ago,
community leaders indicated that, in those villages, a larger share of farmers were
involved.

could not be very specific.

3.5    For the present study, the field survey was concentrated  in villages which have
access to fadama land. However, a few (less than 5 percent) of the farmers interviewed
did not operate or own any fadama land. Almost all of those interviewed indicated that
they owned and operated both upland and fadama land (see Table 3.2). Most farmers had
several plots (the median was 4 upland plots and 3 fadama plots) which were scattered,
and obtaining reliable estimates of the area cropped was very difficult. Thus, areas
reported from the survey should be taken as illustrative rather than definitive (see Annex
3 Note).
2. Increasing Dependence upon Fadama Areas
3.6    Rural people combine more than one income-generating  activity to ensure
economic and food security. As Table 3.3 shows, dry season farming is only one of several
such activities but, as the table also indicates, it is of great importance in the communities
surveyed. While over half the farmers interviewed indicated that wet season farming was
their most important income generating activity, fully a third reported that dry-season
farming was most important. This was particularly the case in Sokoto, where the
proportions were equal at 44 percent. The proportions were reversed with respect to
their judgement on their second most important income source. Thus, almost 90 percent
indicated that dry season farming was their first or second most important income source.
Several respondents also indicated that dry season farming reduces the risk for farmers
who may experience a poor harvest from their wet season farming as they will then have
income from the second crop to buy the food that they were not able to produce.

3.7    The fact that, about 15 years ago, only about 25 percent of farmers were engaged
in dry season farming (see Table 3.4) at all is an indication of the extent of the change
which has occurred over the past decade and a half.
3.8    Data on the actual production of fadama areas is scanty. Production data for
Kano State through the 1980s indicate no real trend in area cropped or in yields for the
rainfed upland crops (see Annex 5, Table A5.6). In fact, the data are most notable in
illustrating the sharp changes in year to year production reflecting the relatively low and
variable rainfall in the state. However, during the same period there was a steady increase
in fadama cultivation, reflecting the fact that the total value of production from fadama
land is likely to be 10 to 20 times as great as for rainfed cropping on upland, with greater
reliability.
3.9    For many of these farmers, dry season farming is still relatively new. Former
income earning activities in the dry season, that required seasonal migration, such as
fishing or working as hired laborers, have now been curtailed in favor of growing a second
crop on fadama lands. Even if a farmer does not have fadama land of his own, greater
opportunities now exist to get jobs as a hired laborer in his own village or to rent a plot of
fadama land nearby.
3.10   Natural events in Northern Nigeria, particularly in the last one to two decades,
have given more motivation to farmers to practice fadama cultivation in the dry season.
ADP staff interviewed indicated that, in their judgement, the recent natural events of
greatest significance to farmers have been the droughts of 1973, 1983-84 and 1987-88;
insect infestations of aphids attacking cash crops (1983-84) and locust invasions (1984-85),
as well as bird damage that posed a serious threat to the wheat crop of 1987-88.
B. Dry Season Fadama Farming Practices
3.11   Though dry season farming with indigenous techniques has had a long history in
the fadama areas under consideration, the proportion of farmers practicing dry season
cultivation at the community level has been shown to have greatly increased. In addition,
most of the farmers practicing dry season farming more than 10 years ago had been
limited to using unreliable residual moisture or the shadouf on very small areas of fadama
land.
3.12   Table 3.4 shows not only the distribution of sampled farmers on the type of dry
season farming they practice, but also the length of time they have been engaged in this
activity and the technology presently used, as well as the changes experienced in the last
10-15 years. Of the farmers interviewed, almost a third drew water from both surface and
ground water sources. Almost a quarter drew from surface sources only, and the balance,
45 percent, from ground water only. About two-thirds of those using surface water, drew
it with a motorized pump, as did more than three quarters of those using ground water.
The pumps have clearly had a revolutionary effect on dry season operations. The recent
introduction of the wash-bore is also having a significant impact where its use is feasible.
It is widely used in Kano, (44 percent of those farmers sampled who are using ground
water) compared to only 3 percent in Sokoto. Conversely, 50 percent of this group in
Sokoto use tubewells, compared to only a quarter in Kano.

Source: Interviews with fadara farmers, Field Study, 1994.
3.13   In a few of the surveyed areas of the former Sokoto State, such as Mai-dahini and
Jaurin Rogo, farmers are still largely limited to the use of a shadouf with water from open
wells or a surface source only. These localities are generally handicapped by limited
access and ADP attention has been extended to them only recently. This indicates that in
less advantaged areas spread of the fadama development innovations without ADP
intervention may be limited. Several farmers in the area still do not practice dry season
farming, except through the use of residual moisture, even though they own fadama land.
On the other hand, in other areas where the technologies have taken hold, farmers have
modified it further to meet their circumstances. For exammple, once farmers combine a
number of strategies, such as observed in Argungu where some farmers use surface water
by shadouf and motorized pump, as well as underground water with open wells and
shadouf, or tubewells and pumps. Others, in areas where tubewells have been drilled,
have been able to fabricate some equipment to drill further wells for themselves.
3.14   The type of dry season farming practiced in a community shows some uniformity
among respondents, even though a few farmers will show a higher level of adoption or
greater area of cultivation. For example, in Sabiya Village, Aliero District of Sokoto
State, most farmers practice dry season farming using both surface water (with motorized
pumps) and underground water from local wells drawn by both shadouf and motorized
pumps. In most cases, they use oxen for cultivating their upland plots, but use neither
oxen nor tractors for fadama cultivation, relying upon family and hired labor.
3.15   As the data also show, among the sampled fadama farmers, the use of shadouf,
manual pumps and residual moisture have been largely replaced by motorized pumps.
This trend meant that many farmers, particularly with large areas of land, cultivate more of
their fadama land in the dry season than before. Olofin (1991) maintains that 82 percent
of fadama holdings in Kano State before 1980 were between 0.2 ha. and 1.0 ha. with none
above 4.0 ha. While the PCR for Kano State agrees that field sizes range from 0.4 to 1.0
ha., the report maintains that overall farm sizes range from 1.6 to 4.3 ha, but are variable
with larger holdings in more remote areas (APMEU, 1991).

C. Ownership and Management of Pumps and Tubewells
1. Individual vs. Group Ownership and Management
3.16   Formal irrigation schemes enable farmers to practice dry season cultivation, but
individual farmers have no control over the amount and flow of water from the source.
Farmers having plots near the source often suffer from water logging, while those far away
may not get enough water for their plants to survive. One of the major advantages of the
fadama development efforts with tubewell or washbores and pumps through the ADP is
that fadama farming is more decentralized, economical, efficient in water management and
under the direct control of the farmer.
3.17   Data summarized in Table 3.5 indicate that ownership of these assets is now really
widespread. Sixty percent of the farmers interviewed indicated that they owned at least
one pump, and almost a quarter have two or more. Not all of these are operational.
Twenty percent of those who responded indicated that their pump was not now
functioning (data collected did not indicate whether this is just because of temporary lack
of spare parts, or the pump is permanently out of action). One third of the farmers
reported that they now have at least one tubewell (half of these have two or more), and
eighteen percent have at least one washbore.
3.18   Hiring pumps out was reported occasionally by the sampled farmers and, in fact
several farmers who own pumps stated that they may allow other farmers to use their
pumps without charge. One respondent stated that he pays N20 (twenty naira)/hour to a
neighbor who owns a pump. A significant proportion of the farmers-but a minority of
those surveyed-either hired, or borrowed, a relative's or a neighbor's pump, so that
'group use' was practiced, but under the control of the owner. In a number of these
cases, the pump was available to others in the afternoon, or on alternate days, when the
pump owner's fields had been irrigated. One woman farmer from Sokoto State said that
she had bought her own pump from the ADP for N3,000 and she allows other women to
use it. For groups of women farmers, or for a family of male farmers, group ownership
and maintenance is likely to be more acceptable, but it is not yet common enough to allow
an evaluation of how well this arrangement works. Ten percent of the farmers reported
that they have two or more washbores and, since the pumps are portable and jetting out
the washbore is inexpensive, this may indicate that some hiring out of equipment is
beginning to develop.

Box 3.1: Subsidization of Pumps and Tubewells
Pumps and tubewells were initially supplied at subsidized rates by ADPs, but the
extent of this subsidy varied significantly between states and periods.  FACU  has
recommended for several years that the ADPs add a markup of 15 percent to the price
paid by them. Thus, in principle, equipment is now sold at full cost. However, each
state has set its own prices and there has not been complete consistency in following
this recommendation. This policy has also been undercut by national policies, eg. on
the exchange rate. This makes the overall level of subsidy for the program almost
impossible to calculate.
For example, in 1994 Plateau ADP imported two types of pumps, 2 inch and 3
inch. The landed cost of these pumps were about US$310 and $400 respectively. At
the then official exchange rate of N22/US$ (which applied to the ADPs), these prices
translated to N6,800 and 8,800 respectively for the two types of pump. The ADP was
adding a markup of N3,000 and N3,700 to cover costs and was selling the pumps at
N9,800 and N 12,500 respectively, which met the FACU requirements.
However, during that period, the estimated parallel exchange rate was
N54.5/US$. At that rate the 'cost' to the ADP should have been about N 17,000 and
N22,000 respectively. At the time open market prices in the area for similar pumps
were reported to be about N 18,500-19,000 for 2-inch pumps and N25,000 for 3-inch
pumps, i.e.,about 10-12 percent above the landed price at the parallel market rate. At
these rates the level of subsidy implicit in the prices charged by the ADP was about 50
percent.
Since those prices were reported, the exchange rate for commercial transactions
has fallen to N80/US$. Thus, the prices in Naira terms for the two types of pumps will
increase to about N25,000 and N32,000 respectively, paid by the ADP, and the prices
charged by the ADP will have to rise to N30,000 to N38,000 to cover this.
3.19   All of the information obtained by the study indicated that group ownership is
rare. The focus group discussions indicated a general view that farming is an activity
which is undertaken as individuals or as families, and control of resources, such as land
and capital goods, takes place at this level. This does not mean, however, that individual
pumps etc. are used only by their owners, but is does mean that there is a reluctance to
enter into situations where rights over an important asset are not clear, or are subject to
continual negotiation.

2. Cost of Irrigation Pumps
3.20   The cost of a pump is an important determinant of the ability of a farmer to adopt
its use and obtain his/her own, even if convinced of the benefits to be derived. Some of
the respondents obtained their first pump (and sometimes subsequent pumps) before the
advent of the project from the 'market (which comprises a number of possible sources).
One farmer reported that he bought his first pump for NIOO in 1979 from Niger. Even at
the time of the project, a number of farmers purchased pumps from other sources,
sometimes because none were available from the project at the desired time, or they had
no contact with the ADP, or because a different model was preferred to the one offered
to farmers by the ADP.
3.21   Table 3.5 gives data provided by selected respondents on the cost of pumps at
different years and from different sources. Wide variation exists within a given time
period, partly due to the fact that some of the pumps may have been second-hand.
Nevertheless, it is clear from farmer comments that the price from the ADP was
consistently lower than market prices. One farmer, for example, stated that he purchased
two pumps in 1987, one in the market for N600 and one at the ADP for N400. Although
it is not known if the two were of the same type, both pumps were still said to be
functioning at the time of the study. As reported elsewhere in this report, this disparity
led to speculative buying of pumps by traders, who later sold the pumps to the farmers at
higher prices.
3.22   The strategy of subsidizing the cost of inputs, adopted by the ADP in the early
years of implementation, often did not have the desired impact and led to farmers
expecting reduced prices from the government-a strategy which has not been sustainable.
Farmers are now required to pay the full cost of pumps and tubewells, and are now paying
more attention to maintenance than in earlier years. Given the rapid increase in the cost
of pumps (in Naira terms) over the past few years, the majority of farmers reported that
they now feel unable to purchase another pump at current market prices. This was
perhaps not surprising under the conditions of late 1994 when the Naira was falling in
value, prices of imported goods were rising, and the outlook for produce prices was very
uncertain.
3. Problems and Benefits from the use of Improved Technology
3.23   Technical problems. Table 3.4 showed that twice as many farmers currently use
tubewells compared to washbores. At the time of project implementation, the technology
for washboring did not allow a washbore to be 'jetted' to the depth (and through the type
of geological formation) that is now possible. At that time, engineering consultants
recommended that, while washbores were feasible in many areas of Kano State with
sandier soils and a higher water table, the conditions in many fadama areas in Sokoto
would require drilling a tubewell. In the earlier years Sokoto ADP was also less interested
in the washbore technology and did little to promote it.
3.24   Presendy, due to the improved technology, the ADPs are encouraging washbore
jetting wherever possible, reportedly to depths as great as seven meters. Under the
present economic conditions, use of the less expensive technology where possible removes



49
a major problem for the farmer. The simpler technology also allows the farmer to easily
move his pump from one location to another if necessary, without requiring drilling
equipment to be brought in again.
3.25   Just over 20 percent of the farmers who had washbores, reported problems with
them. The most common was that they filled up with sand and had to be rejetted. Since
the technique works better in the lighter soils, and since farmers have become more
skilled at jetting out the bores, this does not seem to be a serious problem. Two farmers
reported that they could no longer obtain adequate water from the depth reachable by
their washbore, a problem which appeared to be linked to the construction of an upstream
dam and subsequent lowering of the down stream water table.
3.26   Problems with tubewells were cited by about 13 percent of farmers owning them.
The most common was that the wells did not provide adequate water to meet the farmer's
irrigation needs. In most cases this is probably due to the wells being sited in low
potential areas. Three farmers reported that their tubewells had been damaged by floods,
and were unusable, and two (one in each state) that they had been damaged by Fulani
pastoralists. In one case the Fulani filled the tubewell with cornstalks, while in the other,
they broke off the top.
3.27   Maintenance and repair of pumps has become easier in more recent times as local
mechanics in many fadama areas have learned to do basic servicing and repairs.
Discussions with one farmer/mechanic in Sabiya village, Sokoto State, showed a good
awareness of the types of pumps and the common problems associated with each. He
maintained that Honda, Robin and Yamaha brands of pumps are easier to repair and their
parts are more readily available.
3.28   Production benefits. It is apparent that obtaining a tubewell or washbore and
pump has led to the cultivation of a greater area of land and consequently, increased
production and income. Most farmers who stated that they now had better food security
and increased yield attributed this condition to increased dry season farming. Table 3.6
shows some of the changes made during the project period by farmers in the Central
Zone of Sokoto State, who had been cultivating fadama land using traditional methods
and who then purchased a pump.
3.29   The farmers were classified by group according to area of fadama land cultivated
before purchase of a pump. This shows that in all groups, that area cultivated increased
after pump purchase. The increase, both in area cultivated and in gross income from
fadama crops, was greatest among the medium-sized group. Since about half the farmers
now cultivating fadama did not do so before the start of the project, and a large majority
of the rest now actually making use of pumps are in the small-medium groups (as
classified in this table), the increase in production is clearly large.

D. Changes in Farming Systems
3.30   The integration of wet season cultivation on upland and fadama lands, and dry
season farming on fadama land, with livestock production requires an intricate balance of
climatic and agronomic factors as well as social and family responsibilities. To
accommodate these requirements, fadama farmers have been required to adjust their
agricultural activities. Hard data on these changes is, however, scanty. Analysis by
FACU/APMEU has concentrated on individual crop enterprises and ADP M&E units
have done little survey work to obtain data on typical household operations.



51
1. Cropping Pattern
3.31   The most common wet season crops are sorghum, millet and maize on upland
areas. For the majority of farmers, these crops are grown mostly for household
consumption with the excess sold, usually in the local market. Groundnuts are grown in
some areas-for local processing and for sale. Cotton is produced for sale in a few
localities, also. Beans are grown during the early dry season both for sale and for local
consumption, as well as for use as browse for livestock. Rice is grown in fadama areas
during the wet season mostly for sale.
3.32   Dry season crops grown in fadamas include wheat, tomato, onions, various types of
peppers (with 'tattasai" (sweet red pepper) being the most popular), garlic, eggplant, and
other non-indigenous produce such as cucumbers, lettuce, and carrots. Maize is grown
during the dry season in fadama areas near the towns and urban centers, so that it can be
sold as 'green cobs" to meet the demand for fresh, boiled corn.
3.33   Tomato has become the major crop, reportedly accounting for more than 70
percent of the dry season vegetables in Kano State (Kumar and Gaya, 1994). Several
fadarna farmers, however, stated that they prefer to grow 'tattasai', because it is easier to
transport with less spoilage than tomatoes, due to its lower water content. 'Tattasai'
plants are also more resistant to flood damage, and the return to labor is also good. The
problem of marketing and transporting most of the dry season produce in its unprocessed
form not only reduces profit for producers, but also causes a lot of wastage.
3.34   In Sokoto State, ADP staff stated that they had encouraged farmers to diversify
with Irish potatoes and a few other crops, but the farmers continued to concentrate on
onions and garlic. For farmers that can afford to store or buy these crops at harvest time
for about N400/bag, they can make a great profit by later selling for as much as
N3,000fbag for garlic and N2,500/bag for onions during off-season.
3.35   The farming system is more market oriented than it used to be, and this shift is
directly related to increased dry season farming in the fadama areas. Farmers were asked
to indicate their most important crops today and ten years ago. Farmers' responses can be
grouped into four (see Table 3.7):
(a)    wet season crops on the upland (millet, sorghum, beans etc) that
are predominantly for household consumption, with some excess sold, usually in the local
market or at times of necessary expenditure;
(b)    dry season crops grown on the fadama (tomatoes, peppers, onions
etc.) that are almost totally for sale;
(c)    wet season crops grown in the fadama (predominantly rice) that are
mostly for sale; and
(d)    other cash crops which may be grown in fadama, and which may
receive irrigation water (eg. cotton, sugar cane, wheat).

Smme: Interviews with fadana famiris, Field Study 1994.
3.36   The results indicate a clear shift towards market oriented production and, in
particular, towards crops in group (b). Sixty percent of the farmers indicated that ten
years ago their most important crop was a staple, whereas now only 35 percent consider
that to be the case. Given that 10 percent had indicated that their most important income
source was a non-farm activity, and that a share of the sample was elderly, this means that
almost all the others will have given a cash crop as their most important now. The big
growth in cash crops has been in the vegetables, where the number of farmers citing them
as most important rose from below 20 percent to almost 50 percent. At the same time,
there was some reduction in the importance of other cash crops (group (d)) which fell to
2 percent from 9 percent.
2. Adoption of Innovations
3.37   The use of inputs, including improved seeds, fertilizer, herbicides, pesticides and
storage chemicals, as well as tractors or ox-drawn traction, is now widespread. The fadama
farmers interviewed were asked when they first used the major purchased inputs. Of the
inputs listed, all have been used by at least half of the farmers, except herbicides, where
only ten percent have used them (see Annex 5, Table A5. 1). The responses indicate very
limited use of these inputs before 1980, with only fertilizer being widely used at that time.
Figure 3.1 shows the cumulative use of the inputs since 1980, and indicates that the rapid
spread of their use parallels the life of the ADPs.
3.38   Economic considerations have played a major part in explaining farmers' adoptive
behavior. Interviews with the different types of respondents surveyed indicated that
farmers are more willingto purchase inputs for crops grown on the fadama lands that they



53
will be able to sell and make their profit from, than for wet season crops grown on upland
that are more likely for household consumption. However, in some cases, farmers stated
that they had been using fertilizer for more than 20 years, but with the current prices and
limited availability, they have decreased or stopped its use altogether. One respondent
from Tangwale village stated that improved onion seeds cost N20/packet five years ago,
but now a packet costs N220. The farmer has now begun to produce his own seeds.
3. Lvestock Production and Ox-Drawn Traction
3.39   From the data on rural income-generating activities of fadama farmers (Table 3.2),
it is apparent that livestock production is an important activity for rural dwellers in this
region of Nigeria. Six percent of the farmers interviewed gave it as their first or second
occupation, and for 57 percent it was their third. Table 3.8 gives information on livestock
keeping in Kano State at the time of the project. While over 90 percent of households
kept livestock of some sort, these were predominantly small ruminants and poultry. Only
about one-third of households had cattle, but these averaged seven animals each, and
included oxen for traction purposes. Farmers who own work bulls not only have the
advantage of available traction, but can also hire them out to other farmers. One farmer
in Sokoto State stated that he owns two pairs of work bulls and rents them out for N600-
N 1,000/day.
3.40   From discussions with community leaders, as well as the farmers themselves, other
types of livestock such as cattle, sheep, goats or chickens are not only important for
economic security, but also from the point of view of social status. Almost half of the
farmers surveyed in this study indicated that their first source of cash to meet significant
needs is the sale of some livestock or stored crops (Table 3.9).

3.41   Perhaps surprisingly the survey also indicated an increase in the numbers of
livestock kept over the past 10 years, despite the difficult economic times and the
relatively dry weather and greater difficulty in obtaining feed. Two-thirds of the farmers
responding indicated that they now kept more livestock than before, 19 percent said there
had been no change, and only 15 percent said they now have fewer than before. (See
Table 3.10).
3.42   This finding is in accord with the results of a recent study carried in five Sahelian
countries (with the principal work carried out in Nigeria), which used low level aerial
reconnaissance and ground studies (Bourn and Wint, 1994). This showed a highly
significant relationship between livestock numbers and the intensity of land use, and
suggested that cultivation and human habitation are the best predictors of livestock
distribution. Thus, far from displacing livestock, increased cultivation is accompanied by
increases in livesstock numbers, although there may be a relative change in numbers
between species.
3.43   Regarding the type of traction used, some farmers stated that tractors were not
good for upland plots because the soils are too light and tractors dig too deeply into the
soil. On the other hand, many respondents maintained that fadama soils are heavy and
require tractors for effective cultivation. In several surveyed areas, however, farmers
complained that tractors were not available or the cost, even to hire work bulls, is
prohibitive, so that they had to rely upon family and hired labor.
4. Use of Hired Labor
3.44   Dry season farming requires substantial labor input. Hired laborers are commonly
used, particularly by larger scale farmers. More than 80 percent of farmers interviewed
reported using hired labor in the dry season and 90 percent in the wet season (Table
3. 11). Overwhelmingly local labor (from the same or a nearby community) is used. Those
reporting that labor is easier to obtain than it was 10 years ago outnumber those reporting
greater difficulty by two to one. This is slightly at odds with responses that it is becoming
more difficult to obtain labor, and that out-migration for work is less than it used to be.
However, this suggests that the situation reflects a reduction in employment opportunities
in other regions in the depressed conditions of the past few years and, in that context, the
opportunities offered by the expansion of dry season cropping have been of particular
value.

3.45   For rural people not possessing their own fadama land, casual paid labor provides
a way to also benefit from increased dry season farming. As the use of tractor is
becoming less feasible, the reliance upon ox-drawn traction and manual laborers becomes
even greater. A number of respondents noted that it is becoming more difficult to get
sufficient hired laborers as more alternatives for income generation and more demand for
their labor is currently available.
3.46   Use of family labor is largely restricted to male adults. Older women do assist in
planting, weeding and harvesting, but few children engage on farm labor. In most cases,
female children are not involved at all.
5. Economic Benefits of Cropping
3.47   Financial and economic analysis has consistently shown that the profitability of
irrigated production for the farmer. A substantial analysis was carried out in 1991 for the
appraisal of the NFDP. This showed that, at the then prevailing labor rate of 20 Naira
per day, and prevailing prices, the financial return to a farmer cultivating 0.5 ha with a
combination of grains and vegetables was in excess of 90 percent and for grain production
only was 37 percent for a shallow tubewell and over 60 percent for the cheaper washbores
(World Bank, 1992). Given the level of subsidy of several of the inputs, the ERRs were
lower. For grain production only the return was -1 percent for a farm of 0.5 ha with a
tubewell, but 14 percent for a washbore. If 1.0 ha could be cropped, the return to the
tubewell increased to 20 percent. Thus, returns are subject to wide variation and sensitive
to yields and water use efficiency as well as prices.
3.48   In practice, and especially where much of the labor used is provided by the family,
and it is their main source of income earning, and where the investment is relatively low
relative to the cash flow generated, farmers are interested in the return per man day of
labor. In all cases studied in 1991, the computed net return per manday of labor exceeded
the then market wage of 20 Naira per day by a wide margin. Among individual
commodities, these returns are highest for vegetables, (84 Naira). For rice they were 52
Naira in the dry season and 43 Naira in the wet season.  In contrast, the returns to labor
for the production of rainfed crops, especially the traditional crop mixtures produced in
Northern Nigeria, are frequently less than the market wage rate. This situation indicates
the attractiveness of even small areas of dry season cropping for a family under conditions
of reduced off-farm opportunities.
3.49   More recent analysis indicates a similar picture (see Annex 5, Tables 7-10). Based
on 1994 data for Kaduna and Katsina States financial returns per day of labor were
estimated to range from 45 Naira for tomatoes to 85 Naira for peppers and onions
(compared to a wage rate of about N40), and a mixture of these would yield a return of
about N13,500 per hectare. Assuming that a tubewell and 2 hp pump could irrigate I ha
of such crops, the economic rate of return was estimated at 26 percent (Annex 5, Table
10).
3.50   The sharp shifts in value of the Naira and the proneness of some perishable crops
(e.g. tomatoes) to gluts and low prices, mean that actual returns to farmers fluctuate
widely. The present survey was carried out in late 1994 when the official exchange rate of



60
the Naira was 22 to the dollar and the parallel market rate about 55. Pump prices were
rising and expected to go further. Gasoline was scarce and often expensive because of
problems in the oil industry. The outlook for product prices was uncertain. It is perhaps
not surprising in those circumstances that one-third of the farmers interviewed said that
they could not now "afford" to buy a new pump at market prices. However, one of the
advantages of the pump technology is its flexibility. Given the entrepreneurial nature of
many Nigerian farmers it is reasonable to expect that they will find new ways to utilize the
ability to deliver water, e.g. supplemental water for grains, so as to continue to obtain a
return on their prior investment.
E. Village Level Impacts
3.51   ADPs have been involved with infrastructural development through the
rehabilitation of feeder roads, improving water supply for rural communities through
boreholes, and providing farm service centers to facilitate input supply to farmers. The
importance of improving the road network is seen in the data in Table 3.12 on main road
types/LGA in the Western Zone (Bunza) of SARDA.
3.52   While the primary objective for most cases of constructing rural feeder roads has
been to facilitate marketing in areas already producing, an interesting case study was
discovered in Gummi area of the former Sokoto State. The ADP constructed a rural
feeder road to a rural area about 20 kms from Gummi. The area contains a lake, 10 km
long, 1-2 km wide, with villages located around it. The ADP staff recognized the fadama
potential for dry season production and organized 15 farmers into the Tsibiri Fadamna
Group Farmers Cooperative. That year a pilot irrigation scheme initiated the cultivation
of wheat, rice and maize. After the first year, over 200 farmers enrolled themselves to
form new cooperatives (SARDA, n.d.). In this case, the development of the road led to
the identification of a new area for fadama utilization.

3.53   Interviews with the community leaders indicated that most of the villages do not
have their own market, but have to go to other villages or towns and cities to market their
produce. In most cases, securing transportation to get the goods to other markets did not
appear to be a serious constraint.
3.54   The local leaders also stated that farmers commonly market their produce
individually, although a sizable proportion do market some of their crops as a group by
chartering a vehicle to carry the crops to the urban markets, especially dry season
perishables. This was found to be somewhat more common in the surveyed areas in Kano
State than in Sokoto State, as Tables 3.13 and 3.14 show.

3.55   Much of the crop produced during the wet season is for household consumption
and less perishable in nature, so there is greater concern and emphasis with more
problems upon marketing of dry season crops that are mostly for sale and more
perishable.

4. Impact of ADP Programs on Fadama Development
4.1    The overall objective of this evaluation is to assess the impact of the ADPs,
specifically their programs related to fadama development. The previous chapter has
indicated the extent of the changes in agricultural practices which have accompanied the
adoption of pump and tubewell technology to support the cultivation of fadama lands.
Now, dry season cultivation of fadama is almost as important as rainy season upland
cropping as an income-earning activity in the two states. This chapter assesses the extent
to which the changes which have occurred resulted from the ADP programs and, in
particular, reports the farmers' response to these programs.
A. Farmer Response to the ADP Fadama Development Program
1. Initial Reaction to Recommendations
4.2   It is difficult to generalize about the farmers' initial reactions to different
innovations introduced to increase productivity on fadama lands because some of the areas
were pilot projects and others were later demonstrations. The farmers' reactions seem to
be related to the time of introduction. Earlier introduction of innovations met with more
resistance than later ones when farmers had heard of the advantages. Few farmers totally
rejected the new techniques, however.
4.3   The majority could be classified as demonstrating "limited acceptance", as shown by
the responses of ADP staff, shown in Table 4.1, who were asked to classify their general
impression of the reaction of the farmers they worked with in the early years of the
project to different inputs. This illustrates the much more enthusiastic response of the
farmers to pumps and tubewells/washbores in Kano than in Sokoto, and also that farmers
accepted readily some technologies, such as herbicides, that they have not widely used.
4.4    On the other hand some innovations that were originally rejected or viewed with
indifference have later become accepted and utilized. For example, the treadle pump is
now more attractive since, over the past decade changes have been made in the design
and it is now less strenuous to use. In addition, motorized pumps and their spare parts
have become relatively more expensive, and fuel is scarce and costly. Many farmers now
want a treadle pump as a stand-by substitute in case their other pumps are faulty or fuel
is not available.

2. Extent and Evaluation of Extension Contact
4.5     One of the major achievements of the ADPs nationwide has been that they have
enabled many more farmers to gain access to extension services and information previously
not available to them. There was a wide range of responses on the frequency of the
extension workers visits. Just over forty percent said the agent visited every two weeks or
more, about twenty percent reported less frequent visits, and third did not indicate any
contact. Some farmers maintained that VEAs visit them more often during dry season
when they can concentrate more attention on fadama areas, instead of spreading their
attention to all areas during the rainy season. Being a contact farmer, however, does not
ensure greater attention since some VEAs reside in the local commnunity and interact with
farmers on a daily basis despite whether they are contact farmers or not.
4.6     The credibility of the messages has also increased from the farmers' responses
regarding the sources of information they consider to more trustworthy and accessible,



65
even if not the most frequently used. The results also point out the importance of the
mass media, particularly radio programs, in disseminating information to farmers (See
Figure 4.1 and Table A5.3). Many of the local radio programs that contain agricultural
messages are sponsored and developed by the ADPs. Even though the source of the
information is the mass media, the initiative is still often from the ADP, therefore. The
ADP should make greater use of this medium given the fact that it is most accessible for
farmers, and also given the declining ability of the ADPs to field extensive field services.
However, it is also noteworthy that sixty percent of the farmers said that the ADP agent
was the most trustworthy source of information and just under 40 percent said that he was
the most accessible source. Even allowing for some wish on the part of the survey
respondents to be positive, this does indicate that the extension agents are being a
significant force in technology dissemination.
3. Sources of Innovations
4.7    The role of the ADP in helping the farmer to learn about and obtain agricultural
inputs and technology, including pumps, tubewells and washbores is illustrated in Figures
4.2 and Table 4.2. For the farmers the ADP was clearly the main channel through which
they had become aware of a number of non-traditional technologies. About 70 percent of
the farmers who have used herbicides or pesticides indicated that they first learned about
them from the ADP agent, and the proportion for improved seeds was even higher at
almost 80 percent. These responses are consistent with the earlier response on date of
adoption. In the early stages of the projects, frequent visits by the agents were necessary
not only to introduce and demonstrate new technologies, but also to establish rapport.
Such frequent visits may be less important now.
4.8    Similarly, almost 60 percent of the farmers interviewed said that they bought their
first pumps from the ADP. The rest were purchased from the "market". However, since
almost all the pumps were purchased since 1983, when the ADPs started their operation
and, because quite a number of pumps were in fact sold to traders rather than farmers
(para. 2.27), it is clear that almost all the pumps reported were obtained directly, or
indirectly, through the ADPs.
4.9    Extent of Development. The Kano ADP sold a total of 45,000 pumps and drilled
5,900 tubewells. Data are not available on the number of washbores now being used in
the state. It is estimated that about 60,000 ha are being irrigated as a result of these
investments. In Sokoto the rate of development was somewhat lower. Tle project drilled
4,100 tubewells and sold 19,000 pumps and it is estimated that 40,000 has are being
irrigated as a result.

4.10   Whether development would have occurred on anything like this side if the
projects had not pushed the technologies is difficult to determine. In contrast to the rapid
development in Kano and Sokoto, that in the former Kaduna State (which is located
between Kano and Sokoto) was on a much reduced scale. The Kaduna ADP (Loan 2436-
UNI) operated only a minor fadama development program and by the close of the project
in 1994 it is estimated that only some 11,000 ha were being irrigated. On a regional scale,
Nigeria is the only country in West Africa where there has been any significant
development of tubewell and washbore irrigation, especially on an individual farmer basis.
This strongly suggests that little would have been achieved without the strong initial push
from the ADPs.

4. Relations with the Fulani
4.11   A principal traditional use of the fadama areas has been as grazing areas for
livestock, particularly late in the dry season when other feed sources are scarce. The
Fulani have traditionally been nomadic, or semi-nomadic, herders and the principal owners
of livestock, especially cattle. The extension of cultivation in the fadamas has inevitably
led to friction and occasionally outright conflict between cultivators and the Fulani who
claim traditional, if intermittent, use rights.
4.12   Seventy-five percent of the Fulani interviewed in the survey said that increased dry
season farming had adversely affected them. From the point of view of the herders, the
ADPs have not taken any action to assist the pastoralists. The general response of the
semi nomadic Fulani that could be interviewed was that no one from the ADP or the
government in general had helped them. Thirty percent of those interviewed indicated
that they had had contact and been advised by ADP staff, but it was clear that the Fulani
did not consider this useful. Individual comments included, "They are not interested in the
Fulani or our animals" and "The ADP is useless to us". In one reported example, a Fulani
respondent said they were advised to move out of an area in which many were
concentrated. They were given no substitute area and yet "no one uses the place we were
told to leave". Another stated that he had been advised to take his sick animals to the
veterinary clinic, and another that staff recommended that he grow grasses etc. as fodder
for his cattle.
4.13   The difficulty is that while the project staff realize the seriousness of the problem,
they do not have a solution. The project's primary mandate focuses upon increasing
agricultural productivity with emphasis upon crops. The projects contained no 'livestock
component and, therefore, were not in a position to provide any tangible support. Few of
the ADP staff have significant knowledge of livestock, so there is little they can offer in
the way of advice to build up confidence and relationships (as indicated by the quotes
above). To the ADP, therefore, the "Fulani problem" needs to be solved, as far as they
are concerned, because of its effect upon the farmers' productivity. The special
implications related to the Fulani and their need for grazing land is considered in the next
chapter of this report.
5. Overall Farmer Perception of ADP Performance
4.14   In aspects directly related to agricultural production, most respondents felt that the
ADP had been very beneficial to the rural inhabitants. However, there was some
evidence of a credibility gap (see Box 4.1). It was difficult for respondents to evaluate the
performance of the Project in specific areas such as provision of inputs or value of
extension information over the period of ten years, however, most of the leaders gave an
overall assessment by comparing the ADP's impact presently with that of the mid-1980s
(see Table 4.3).

Box 4.1: Tensions between Farmers and ADPs
One impression left with those who conducted the imterviews and group
discussions for this study was that individual farmers, and even the community
leaders, were not clear as to the goals, objectives and operations of the ADPs.
Farmers felt generally uninvolved in decision making and a "take-it-or-leave-it"
attitude was often associated with ADP packages. The ADPs have been aware of
this problem and have been attempting to get greater farmer input into the design
of recommendations and applied research through the involvement of farmer
representatives into relevant committees.
However, extension programs, recommendations and packages have to be
decided upon at some central level, certainly above the village extension agent and
contact farmer. The subtleties of why particular recommendations are made may
well not be fully transmitted to the village extension agent. Thus, when it comes
to his interaction with the farmer there will be situations in which he has to fall
back on "that's the way it is" as an explanation, something which is bound to leave
the farmer unsatisfied.
One area in which this has been a particular problem is the procedure for
purchase of pumps and tubewells. ADP extension staff discuss the possibility of
farmers purchasing pumps or drilling tubewells through the ADP, several months
before the wells are to be drilled, or the pumps delivered. Since the pumps are
bulk purchased by International Competitive Bidding (ICB) procedures, the ADPs
need to obtain some assessment of the likely demand from farmers before
awarding a contract. Unfortunately, at that stage the price to be charged, or in
some cases the make of the pump, is not known with certainty. The Bank ICB
procedures limit the extent to which the bidding procedures can restrict the range
of bids. Specifications can be drawn up to eliminate types which are unsuited to
the conditions because of capacity etc., or for which there is no local experience.
However, the contract may not be won by the supplier of the brand which is most
popular locally. Also, the dollar price quoted in the winning bid is not known
until the contract is awarded and accepted.



71
Box 4.1 (continued)
It is not until this point that the ADP can be definitive about the naira
price and the repayment terms. Thus, the farmer is expected to express an
interest in the program, in the absence of these relevant details. This process has
been further handicapped by the rapid decline in the value of the Naira in some
recent periods. Since the pump etc., may not be exactly what the farmer had in
mind at the outset, he may see it as being something supplied by Government,
rather than something he specifically ordered. As a result, he may be less than
fully committed to repaying the cost, especially if there has been a significant
escalation in Naira prices.
The result of this process is that the farmers tend to feel that they are
kept in the dark and to assume that their preferences on specifications etc. are not
taken into account. These preferences may have been considered, but the scoring
procedure and the relevent bids may have resulted in the less popular model being
selected. At the same time, the ADP staff are embarrassed by not being able to
give straight, definitive answers to farmers, about why prices have gone up, or
particular models were chosen.
4.15   The general conclusion of the village heads was that without the ADP, dry season
farming would not have increased at the rate which has been achieved, because of the lack
of farmers' groups and the strong family links that limit the potential of farmers to
develop individually.
4.16   On the other hand, Table 4.4 shows that marketing as well as other assistance in
non-direct production areas, such as securing or supervising a loan, have not been areas
with which the ADP has helped farmers in the past. According to the cluster audit and
from data in the internal project PCRs, credit was not initially thought to be a priority
since, at the time of the SAR, subsidized input supply would remove the major need fbr
credit to facilitate adoption of innovations. However, as the projects ventured into
activities that required farmers to invest more capital, such as with fadama dry season
farming, credit became increasingly important. Available data for Kano and Sokoto ADPs
indicate that very few farmers benefitted from any credit assistance as less than 100
farmers in Kano State were assisted by the ADP to secure loans for the workbull/tractor
purchase scheme through individual bank application. Sokoto State recorded a better
mark of about 1,000 farmers receiving a loan for the pump-hire scheme.

4.17   In the area of marketing, farmers who answered that the ADP had assisted them
added that this was mainly in the case of finding a market outlet for their wheat in earlier
years, or in providing marketing information. Having recognized these problems, the
ADPs are presently in the process of trying to improve services for fadama farmers to get
produce to market, particularly perishable items such as tomatoes and peppers. The
Jigawa State ADP has recently proposed to improve transport, storage, grading and
standardization, packaging, as well as bring buyers and sellers together giving them
financing information (JARDA, 1994).



73
B. ADP Self Evaluation
4.18   From the interviews with ADP staff, there was a general consensus that, although
some farmers had bought pumps and dug wells or used surface water without ADP
encouragement, the spread of dry season farming to the number of farmers now practicing
it, and the involvement of small-scale farmers, would not have occurred without outside
intervention, such as was provided by the Projects. The ADP personnel also agreed that
the impact of the ADP upon the rural population generally, and especially in the case of
improving the standard of living of fadama farmers, had been very significant and positive,
by improving household food security, as well as increasing rural incomes.






75
5. Social and Other Impacts of Fadama Development
A. Social Change
1. General Well-being of Members of the Community
5.1    During interviews with local leaders in rural communities in northern Nigeria, they
suggested a series of indicators of well being and social status, which are summarized in
Table 5.1. There was a general consensus in the FGDs, and in discussions with
community leaders that, over the past decade, there has been a relative shift of households
towards those characteristics in the right hand column of the table. The vast majority of
farmers and leaders agreed that the people in the fadama areas are better-off now than 10
years ago. Nine out of eleven leaders in Kano/Jigawa and eight out of nine in
Sokoto/Kebbi States stated that their people were generally better off now and many
agreed that it was due to dry season farming activities.
5.2    On the other hand, the proportion of the households in their communities that
had improved their standard of living followed the earlier assessment of the proportion of
farmers in each area that own fadama land. For example, in Sokoto area, 8 out of 9
leaders stated that "nearly all" of their people had an improved level of welfare. In Kano
area, however, only 2 leaders could state that "nearly all" were better-off, 5 said only one-
half of their people had benefitted from efforts in the past 10 years, while 3 leaders stated
that only one-fourth of their people were enjoying a better standard of living. Thus, the
development of fadama land is perceived as having been central to improvement of
agricultural communities in these states.
5.3    The importance of dry season farming as an additional source of income is
generally accepted by interviewed farmers, community leaders and ADP staff alike. The
cycle of a small area cultivated with low level of technology resulting in little output that
does not allow for reinvestment at a level to increase productivity is the dilemma for
poorer fadama farmers, who are in the majority. It is this category of farmers that the
project has been able to assist most.
5.4    Food security. Dry season farming on fadama lands has two advantages which
alleviate problems for farmers in the event of adverse conditions or disasters. First,
fadama cultivation in the wet and dry seasons in addition to upland farming in the wet
season allows crop diversification so that if one crop is damaged or destroyed, other crops
will ensure food security. Second, the income realized from dry season cash crops allows
the farmer to not only improve household economic security and invest resources to
increase productivity, but also provides money to buy food in the event of food crop
failure. In 1994, for example, unusually heavy and prolonged rains flooded out many of
the crops in the wet season. The fadama farmers who practice dry season cultivation were
less worried than other farmers about their family's welfare, knowing their dry season
crops would provide for them until the next rains.

5.5    Despite the increasing costs and lower profits, it must be clearly understood that
unlike many other areas of the country and even non-fadama areas within the same states,
fadama farmers are far more secure when it comes to having sufficient food and money to
meet the needs of their families.
5.6   In the focus group discussions with both men and women, the general consensus
was that they now eat better foods, such as yam, rice and meat. Fadama farmers can
afford to buy bread and seasonings from the towns. Before, they said, people relied upon



77
only millet for household consumption. Table 5.2 clearly shows that fadama farmers, for
the most part, have enough food all year round, and more than they had 10 years ago.

5.7    These results indicate that, overall, the households surveyed are clearly better off
than they were a decade ago; food security is better. However, about 15 percent of them
reported that they have insufficient food and a similar number that they had less now than
before. The two groups responding adversely are not the same and, as can be seen, there
were interstate variations in the response to these questions. To probe this question
further the responses to the two questions were compared:
Category                     Number                  Percentage
Sufficient food, more food now              166                       66

Source: Interviews with fadama farmer, Field Study, 1994.
5.8    The overwhelming majority of the respondents are food secure at the household
level. It is not clear whether those who reported that they did not have sufficient food
meant that they literally went hungry, or that they did not produce enough to meet their
needs. For example, some farmers who complained that they have less food now, gave the
reason that they are now older and unable to farm as much as before. Widowed females
who are household heads are also finding it more difficult to maintain food security, as



78
they no longer have husbands to work with. Others stated that they now have a larger
family (which is growing) so that, even as the total amount they have produced has
increased, the family demand has increased more quickly. The impact of the 1994 floods
can not be entirely ruled out since, despite the enumerators explanation, many farmers
still focussed on the fact that in late 1994 they had less food than usual available for their
families. A significant area of the wet season crop, grown for household consumption, was
flooded and damaged or destroyed.
5.9    There was evidence of localized problems, with some villages having a higher than
average proportion of respondents stating they have less food now. Some of the
respondents who said that they have less food have small areas of fadama land, which they
cultivate with the use of traditional methods, such as local wells or shadoufs, or use of
residual moisture. There was also one village surveyed where construction of a dam has
caused flooding of much of the fadama area.
5.10   Health. In terms of the state of the health of fadama farmers, there were two
opinions. While some community leaders reported that there had been an increase in the
incidence and intensity of malaria, other diseases such as guinea worm had, for the most
part, declined due to better water supplies and medical facilities. The leaders
acknowledged that the increased income allowed rural people to spend money on hospital
care, if necessary. And, even though the incidence of malaria may have increased, most
families were more able to obtain treatment, so that the impact has declined.
5.11   A study on the "Health Hazards of Fadama Farming" found similar results that in
general, the farmers felt they and their families were healthier than farmers not cultivating
fadama lands and than they had been before they were farming in the dry season. Further
investigations did, however, reveal that the farmers were more attacked by malaria,
schistosomiasis, helminthiasis, onchocerciasis, and so on than other family members not
working in the fadama areas (Sridhar, M.K.C., 1994).
2. Migration
5.12   Dry season migration has a long history in the Sokoto area where oral history
indicates a tradition (pre-colonial) of movement for trading or employment by males.
Colonial presence did not create, but rather reshaped and extended migratory patterns
(Swindell, 1982). Dry season migration has been such a common social occurrence that
the Hausa term yan chi-rani became popular to refer to men who migrate to gain
employment during the dry season. The term is variously translated as "men who eat - or
work - the dry season away". In present times, migrants prefer the term bida instead of
chi-rani ("looking for work or wealth").
5.13   From the study, it was seen that much of this dry season migration has slowed to a
trickle as dry season farming has opened up new income generating opportunities for rural
inhabitants in Kano and Sokoto States. One of the community leaders stated that fadama
development has stopped much of the annual movement of northern farmers to southern
areas such as Kwara State or Jos area during the dry season as they can now farm all year.
He remarked that this trend has become increasingly more pronounced during the last 20
years. One respondent from Sokoto State explained how he used to be away from the



79
village for 5-6 months a year, from 1976 to 1990, for trading as far as Ibadan, and Beim.
It was when he saw the benefits of dry season farming that he stopped this seasonal
migration. The few farmers that do still migrate travel for trading and some for further
Koranic education. Many who had migrated before had gone for fishing or hired labor, as
noted above. In several cases, leaders noted that people from neighboring areas that do
not have fadama resources come to their communities for work as hired laborers or to
rent land, if possible. This in-migration from other areas had been particularly noticeable
in the last 7-8 years.

B. Gender Issues in Fadama Development
1. Gender Roles in Agricultural Production In Northern Nigeria
5.14   A common misconception concerning rural women in Northern Nigeria is that they
are all in purdah (kulle), and, therefore, economically and agriculturally inactive. Women
in purdah do not, technically, 'work to earn a living (since Islam states that the husband is
expected to provide food, shelter and support), but 'many poor families are, nonetheless,
sustained by the economic activities of wives in seclusion" (Callaway, 1987: 68) (see Box
5.1). The women in purdah, however, do not actually work on the farm land, particularly
during their years of childrearing.
5.15 Although the majority of the population in the studied states are Muslim Hausa, a
significant proportion are non-Muslim Hausa, or Maguzwa. Jackson (1985) estimated
that about 5 percent of the Hausa in Kano State are not Muslim. Other ethnic groups
have also been found to be common in a few of the studied areas, as well as the Fulani,
many of whom are semi- or fully settled. In Chiyeko village of Jigawa State, for example,
ethnic diversity is evidenced by widely different gender relationships. Muslim Hausa and



80
Fulani women own land, but do not work on the land themselves. Non-Muslim Hausa, as
well as Kanuri women, do not own land, but farm extensively. Indeed, as Barkow (1972)
reported, non-Muslim Hausa men acknowledge that "Our women feed us."
Box 5.1: Seclusion and Women's Work
Many of the women are only partially secluded, while others are not
secluded at all, even among the Muslim Hausa. Unmarried girls, under 11 or 12
years of age, and women who have passed the age of childbearing have little or no
restrictions on their movement. The degree of seclusion, even for women under
Icull varies somewhat by socio-economic class, as Tarfa (1994) concludes that
women from poor or very large families, widowed or divorced women, old women
and children form a major part of the regular labor force.
On the other hand, Longhurst (1982) reported that the main differences in
seclusion and consequent work outside the compound appear to be linked to the
type of community of residence. In general, he maintained, urban women are
more secluded than rural, and rural women from larger, nucleated settlements are
more secluded than those from smaller, dispersed settlements.
5.16   While views and practices vary from community to community, and also between
families, society in most of the villages in the project areas is conservatively Islamic. This
made it difficult to interview women directly, except for a few non-muslim women and
those not in seclusion. It was feasible to meet with groups of women and four focus
group discussions were held. However, while these samples were obviously limited and it
was also difficult to obtain any specific data from these interviews, a general consensus
emerges, which is reported below.
5.17   In the overwhelming majority of cases, male fadama farmers interviewed stated
that their wives do not work directly on the farm; 94 percent in Kano/Jigawa and 87
percent in Sokoto/Kebbi States. It should be noted, however, that since this is the
culturally preferred situation, it may be that some respondents replied in the negative
because of social desirability or because their wives help in a limited way at times of peak
labor demands. This also does not take into consideration the processing of agricultural
produce.
5.18   Gender roles in agricultural activities, as well as household responsibilities, vary
greatly according to ethnic, class and religious differences. However, all northern rural
women are engaged in food processing and most rear small livestock, while selling cooked
food and snacks is also a common income earner. Threshing and pounding grains is
women's work. Non-Muslim women are more involved in day-to-day field activities, not
only for their own crops, but also on their husbands' fields as well. Fulani women
generally do not engage in crop production, as it denotes a culturally "shameful' situation



81
that the man cannot feed his wife (or wives) (Makinwa-Adebusoye and Olawoye, 1991).
For Fulani, farming is considered a male activity, and only in desperate situations, women
help in weeding and harvesting (Salih, 1992). Women are responsible for processing and
marketing milk products, as well as provision of some household needs from the proceeds.
5.19 Many rural Northern women own both upland and fadama land that they inherited
from their fathers, in accordance with Islamic tenets. In the case of a woman in purdah, a
male relative may be responsible for the day to day management of the farm, but the
woman owner has the profit or produce from the farm. Women who are not under
seclusion, or only partially secluded, engage in production tasks such as planting, weeding
and harvesting, as well as processing that is common to all women whether in purdah or
not.
5.20   The proficiency in farming of some women is illustrated by the case of a 60 year
old woman from Sabiya village who was honored as the Sarki Noma (best farmer in the
village). She has six plots of land, 3 of them in fadama area, which she inherited. In
another case, a 45 year old divorced woman came "home" to farm. She has both upland
and fadama land some of which she has inherited and others were purchased. She hires
work bulls for her farm, sometimes jointly with other women farmers.
2. Impact of Fadama Development on Rural Women
5.21   Tarfa (1994) maintains that women involved in dry season commercial crop
production on family plots, not on their own plots, often must take on additional work,
but reap no economic benefits. She contends that the economic gains for the man often
times do not result in improved household food or economic security.
5.22   Nevertheless, from the findings of the study, while there was no direct
contact/assistance given to women under the ADP, rural women have benefitted
economically from increased dry season farming on fadama lands in a number of other
direct or indirect ways. Interviews in FGDs with women indicated that they do recognize
that the efforts of the ADP have brought more productivity for their husbands engaged in
dry season farming, more money in the community, and more demand for fadama land
from those who have land. For the family as well as for their personal income and their
ability to increase their own wealth, the women felt that the change had been positive,
even if it had not been directed at them (see Box 5.2). For the men, the impact has been
felt more directly as they have seen greater opportunities open up for them.
5.23   However, there have been some ways in which women have benefitted more
directly. For example, some have made additional money by renting their fadama land
during the dry season to other farmers, as was seen in Bunkure, Kano State. Another
benefit has been that women traders make more money from their trade now that fadama
farmers have more money to spend.



82
Box 5.2: Economic Relationships Within the Household
Among the Northern Muslims of Nigeria, relationships between men and
women in the household are highly monetized, with the income and spending
pattern of each being kept strictly separate. Land and other significant assets are
seen as individual rather than family holdings. The husband is responsible for
providing the basic needs for the family and carries the main burden of field work
to achieve this. Earnings from the sale of those items which are surplus to the
needs of the household accrue to him. In the event that he is temporarily unable
to do so, his wife (wives) may loan him grain or money. The effect of this type of
arrangement is to maintain the achievement of the basic food requirements of the
family from the husband's land as a prime objective for the husband unless he is in
a line of business where he is very sure of being able to purchase the basic food
needs.
Women may also have some livestock but these are seldom an income
earner for them and are kept more as a source of liquid capital and to meet
emergencies. One of the major objectives of the women is to build up assets to
pass along to their children, particularly their daughters, at the time of marriage.
For this purpose they often invest in decorative pots, dishes and covered bowls
and plates. These items are important indicators of status, particularly during the
marriage ceremony of daughters. Plates and dishes are also a type of savings,
appreciating in value and easily sold when cash is urgently needed. Women
interviewed indicated that they have increased such assets in recent years.
5.24   The experience from the fadama development program is similar to that recorded
by Jackson (1985) in the Kano Irrigation Project; that is, different women were affected in
different ways, non-Muslim women earning wages from casual labor while Muslim women
benefitted from selling more food and snacks. Jackson, however, concluded that Muslim
women were better-off from the project, but non-Muslim women were actually worse off.
Since Muslim women have some control over land and cash crops, as well as their
independent income, it is reasonable to assume that the same conclusion can be reached
for the fadama development program.
5.25   One category of women that are unlikely to have benefitted from the project is
those of female-headed households, particularly those resulting from widowhood. A
women's group in Argungu showed that women who had to provide for their children
without their husbands were in a precarious condition, particularly those with very young
children with no older son to represent the interests of the family. They could not even
benefit indirectly from the project which, until the last few years, had no means of
integrating women.



83
3. The ADPs and Women Farners
5.26   Until very recently, the ADPs were not focussed upon female farmers, whether in
upland or fadama areas, largely because the male extension agents could not contact them
and women could not participate in the Fadama Users Associations (FUAs) formed by the
ADP. Furthermore, one of the constraints of fadama development strategies has been
that emphasis has been placed upon production and marketing of dry season produce,
with little attention to processing and storage technology that could really benefit women
and enhance household food security (Tarfa, 1994). The FGN is now trying to assist
women in their agricultural activities through the Women in Agriculture (WIA) Units of
the ADPs. During the project period (1982-1990), very little attention was directed to
rural women as the WIA units were just getting established. In the initial stages the
ADPs were constrained by a lack of qualified women extension agents with the
recommended minimum qualification of Ordinary National Diploma (OND).
5.27   Rural women have not been able to participate in the Fadama Users Associations
(FUAs) formed by the ADPs in the NFDP. Previous attempts to form Fadama Users
Cooperative Societies were similarly restricted to males. However, there may be more
interest among women than men in establishing group operations. For women any
cropping they do in fadama areas is likely to be incidental to their main activities. For
example, growing out of their primary responsibility for maintaining the home and
preparing family meals etc., women frequently prepare foods and snacks for sale outside of
the household, so as to earn some income for themselves. Not infrequently they have
small plots of land themselves and may use them to produce some of the requirements for
their food products. In expanding this activity a number of women have become
interested in the possibility of cropping in the dry season. However, their requirements
for supplementary water are likely to be quite small and not be enough to justify investing
in a pump individually. Similarly, they may be interested in producing some staples to
meet possible emergency needs. In both cases the women would fit their crop production
activities around their principal preoccupations. There have been a number of cases
where groups of women have got together to obtain a pump for their overall use. For
example, in one of the villages where a discussion was held with a group of women, a
group of 20 women (all in purdah), under the supervision of a female extension agent, are
managing a one acre plot of fadama land, to grow wheat in the dry season and rice in the
rainy season.
C. Land Use Conflict at the Village Level
5.28   The farmer survey asked a number of questions about land holdings and tenure in
order to assess whether the development of pump and tubewell technology had had any
impact on these arrangements. The responses obtained did not indicate that this has
occurred. Land holdings both of fadama and upland are fragmented (see Annex 6) and
the survey did not indicate consolidation, although this may be occurring. Nor did it
indicate any increase in renting or sale of land. The principal land related problem in the
fadama areas is conflict over access between pastoralists and crop producers.



84
1. Relationship Between Fulani and Indigenous Cultivators
5.29   The Fulani (Peul) form a major ethnic grouping which has traditionally been
closely linked to nomadic or semi-nomadic pastoralism in the Sahel. As its, and other,
populations in the region have grown, so have conflicts over land. More land has been
brought under cultivation and this has impinged on the areas used by the pastoralists. At
the same time, some of the Fulani have adopted more sedentary systems of livestock
production, while others have shifted to urban occupations (see Annex 7).
5.30   Competition for use of land in the northern states has traditionally been resolved
quite easily, since fadama land was largely available for pastoralists to graze their cattle in
the dry season when dry season farming was limited to small areas, usually with the use of
shadouf. However, due to the expansion of dry season farming, conflicts between farmers
and pastoralists have become common.
5.31   Settlement of Fulani pastoralists has been one strategy to try to reduce the conflict
between them and cultivators, but it is not an acceptable alternative to most nomadic
Fulani who believe settlement is not consistent with their socio-cultural heritage and
"cannot bring them satisfaction" (Vabi, 1991). Many Fulani believe that long settlement
renders cattle susceptible to disease attack, so that they need to keep on the move in
order to keep cattle healthy and productive (Vabi, 1991).
5.32   The nature of the relationships between Fulani and the indigenous populations is a
complex issue due to changes in land use conditions and variations in settlement patterns
of the Fulani. Vabi (1991) analyzed the variety of social interactions between these social
groups as follows:
[Interaction between cultivators and graziers] "are best understood in terms of a
continuum ranging from mobile to sedentary modes of agricultural production
systems with a number of intervening points.... determined by fallow durations in
the case of crop cultivation, and the duration of pastoral settlement in the case of
animal husbandry.... The duration of pastoral settlement is an adaptation to range
land conditions, water availability, and animal disease challenge, as well as to the
nature of the social relationships between the pastoral group and resident farming
communities" (Vabi, 1991: 4).
2. Land Use Arrangements
5.33   In many areas, there have been land use agreements between farmers and
pastoralists that have been to the benefit of both. Among the farmers interviewed, about
one-third maintained agreements with the Fulani herders. The most typical arrangement
is that farmers allow the herders to bring the livestock into their farms after the crops
have been harvested. While the animals feed on the crop residues, the land is refertilized
through their manure.   From the opposite side, just over 60 percent of the Fulani
interviewed said that they do enter into agreements with farmers, but only 40 percent of
those actually make payments to the farmers for the grazing.



85
5.34   It must be recognized that having an agreement with the pastoralists does not
necessarily ensure that there would be no conflict between them and the farmers.
Conflicts are common, as shown in Table 5.4, with 40 percent of the fadama farmers
interviewed stating that they have had problems with Fulani herdsmen in the last five
years and the majority of the Fulani also reporting conflict. While there are no records, it
is generally accepted on all sides that these conflicts have been increasing.

5.35   Some farmers interviewed complained that, at times, Fulani herders would come to
ask for permission to enter and offer to pay for a field that was not yet harvested. To
agree would be to lose the produce or sell at an unreasonable price. Sometimes, however,
the herders would still drive their cattle in at night and try to leave before they would be
discovered. At other times, farmers would enter into an agreement with semi-settled
Fulani to allow their cattle to graze after harvesting, but another group of Fulani would
come earlier and destroy the crops (see Box 5.3).



86
Box 5.3: Causes and Consequences of Conflicts
Hadejia (1994) classified the remote and immediate causes of the conflict
between cultivators and pastoralists in fadama areas as follows:
a) "Remote" causes of conflict:
- Sahelian drought of 1970s;
- River control; and
- Preferential treatment of crop producers by government officials.
b) "Immediate" causes of conflict:
- Crop damage;
- Insufficient grazing areas;
- Activities of Yan dabalde (group of armed herders who commit
intentional crop damage and attack farmers who want to stop them;
- Bush burning;
- Population increase; and
- Superstition (farmers claim Fulani have the belief that herd should
damage crops 3 times to survive that year).
These causes can be summarized into two viewpoints: that of the
cultivators who maintain that the primary cause of conflict is the intentional and
deliberate crop damage by the herders' animals, and that of the Fulani who
consider the major problem to be the expansion of the area of cultivation,
particularly for dry season cropping, into upland and fadama lands that were
traditionally grazing sites (Hadejia, 1994).
The most common problem found in the survey was that cattle were
allowed onto fields before the crops were harvested and destroyed them. In
addition, wells and other property are reported to have been damaged. For
example, a farmer in Taloka Village, Sokoto State, said that some Fulani had
broken the top of his tubewell in 1994. Similar, more serious incidents were
reported near Bunza, in the present Kebbi State, where about 30 tubewells were
destroyed as pastoralists reacted to the perceived loss of more traditional grazing
grounds with increased dry season cropping.



87
Box 5.3 (continued)
Determining the source of crop damage is not always easy and may be by
animals other than the ones of the pastoralist who had arranged to use the land. For
example, one Fulani herder interviewed reported that he had been accused of
allowing his animals to destroy a crop of millet, arrested, and thrown in jail. He
maintained that that the damage had been caused by another herd. The police
investigated and determined that this was so, and charges were dropped. However,
in the meantime he had had to sell some sheep in order to raise the bail money
needed to get himself released from jail.
The Fulani interviewed stated that their grazing routes had changed in the last
few years, usually due to more dry season farming. Some official grazing reserves are
within or near fadama areas which are now more keenly coveted by farmers for dry
season farming. In Bunza, Kebbi State, the pastoralists complained that the farmers
are encroaching into the grazing reserves, pushing the Fulani and their cattle farther
into the bush. One Fulani stated that, as they clear more reserve land for their
livestock, the farmers again take over the land. He also said that when the former
District Head died, the new traditional leader was less sympathetic to the needs of
the Fulani, and the herders were denied the use of fadama land around Bunza.
3. The Pastoralists' View of the Cause of Recurrent Conflicts
5.36   In this study, a number of pastoralists were interviewed to try to get a more
balanced picture of the conflict between the two parties. Most of the Fulani respondents
agreed that it is more difficult now than 10 years ago to get water and grazing land for
their livestock, particularly in the dry season, and a majority of those interviewed reported
that they had had conflicts with farmers in the past five years (see Tables 5.4 and 5.5).
They also complained that they were often accused of destruction caused by others.
Generally, most of the conflict is perceived to relate to nomadic Fulani, especially from
Niger Republic, and not from the local, semi-settled pastoralists. However, the semi-
settled Fulani interviewed in this study, complained that they often suffer the
consequences of the actions of these nomadic groups because farmers are unable to
"catch" the offending herders and their cattle that often come in the night and escape
before being discovered, and so the local cattle come under suspicion.

5.37   The Fulani interviewed also complained that these confrontations injure their
relationship with other ethnic groups in the area of their permanent or semi-permanent
residence. The Fulani farmers also similarly suffer loss of their crops to these nomadic
herds. It should be noted that a significant number of the interviewed fadarna farmers are
fully settled Fulani. As Vabi states, "Discriminatory tendencies [between Fulani
pastoralists and farmers of other ethnic groups] would have been insignificant if they were
not connected with opportunities for economic survival" (1991: 5).
5.38   The Fulani herds are not insubstantial. Among the Fulani interviewed in this
study, the average herd size consists of about 40-50 cattle, 20-25 sheep and 15-20 goats,
and 70 percent said that they had increased over the past decade (Table 5.6). A similar
number also said that their herds are healthier than they used to be, so that, if the
problems of obtaining grazing had any adverse impact on animal condition, the herders
have been able to offset it in various ways.

5.39   However, an additional problem has arisen for some Fulani with respect to the
management of the Gudali breed of cattle, common in the Sokoto area. These are an
improved breed which have traditionally been maintained in fadaina areas in the dry
season. They do less well when shifted to the poorer feed found in upland grazing,
especially in the dry season. Increased use of fadama for cropping has, however, had this
effect and some of the herders interviewed complained of the difficulties of maintaining
their milk production and indicated that they may have to switch to less productive breeds
if they cannot get access to better quality feeds.
5.40   There was also unanimity that the ADPs were seen as having done nothing for the
Fulani, including that the projects have not helped them find grazing land. There is a
general feeling that, in most cases, the viewpoint of the cultivators is treated with more
official seriousness than that of the cattle-rearers. The views of the Fulani are seldom
sought for, nor taken into consideration to find a lasting solution.

6. Environmental Impact
A. Cause of Environmental Changes
6. 1    Specific attention was not paid to the potential environmental impact of project
activities at the appraisal of the ADPs and no monitoring was undertaken. Environmental
concerns were addressed at the appraisal of the National Fadama Development Project
(NFDP). An Environmental Impact Assessment was prepared in 1991 which addressed
the following issues for the northern tier of states, including Kano and Sokoto:
(a) Water, Soil, and Cropping Patterns;
(b) Wildlife;
(c) Fish and Fisheries;
(d) Social Conflict (as discussed in Chapter 5); and
(e) Public Health
Monitoring activities are now being undertaken by the ADPs in connection with the
implementation of the NFDP.
6.2    The major concern in understanding the impact of the fadama development
strategies upon the environment is how to isolate the specific cause to the effect. Unlike
formal irrigation schemes with large dams that resulted in resettlement of people and
submerging, thereby destroying, fadama lands, traditional fishing pools and economic trees,
it is difficult to tie informal dry season farming in fadama areas to ecological changes. The
impact of a few thousand tubewells and washbores scattered all over the state is relatively
insignificant, except in areas of low water table recharge capability or places with a
concentration of wells and pumps. Nevertheless, any intervention has an impact and can
be a potential threat to the environment, unless monitored from early stages of the
project.
6.3   In addition it may be difficult to distinguish the impact of projects from the effect
of more general climatic and related change. For example, the annual flood inundation in
the Hadejia Basin, (largely in Kano State) has been reported to have been about 3,300
km2 in 1950, 2,400 km2 in 1969, 2,000 km2 in 1974, 1,200 km2 in 1986, and 700 km2 in 1987
(Adams and Hollis, 1988). This decline reflects both the general decline of rainfall in the
Sahelian region since the 1960s as well as the effects of dam construction and the filling of
reservoirs within the catchment, starting in the mid 1970s. Declines of this type in several
catchments have been a significant factor in encouraging farmers to adopt irrigation using
pumps and wells to offset its effect.



92
6.4    Given these difficulties, the monitoring results to date do not indicate any marked
deterioration of environmental conditions in the project areas. Generally, ADP staff
believe that there have not yet been any significant detrimental effects from fadama
development upon the environment, but they recognize the potential for problems such as
chemical overload, leaching, and salination.
6.5   In order to obtain an indication of the perception of environmental conditions and
change, the farmers and community leaders interviewed for this study were asked whether,
in their judgement, there had been any change in a number of environmental indicators
over the past decade. This indicated a divergence of views (see Table 6.1 for a summary
of responses of community leaders). The results, though do perhaps suggest a greater
perception of negative impacts in Kano State than in Sokoto.

a. Not all of the leaders responded that there had been a change in the fish or wildlife population in areas where such
species are not commnon.

B. Water, Soil and Cropping Patterns
6.6    Water. The most obvious difference in the responses between the two states was
in the question of the changes in the level of the annual flood inundation. Seven of the
eleven Community leaders interviewed in Kano said that the level had fallen, while only
one of the eight interviewed in Sokoto State did so. Similarly, six of the leaders reported
that wells had dried up, whereas, again only one in Sokoto did so. These observations may
reflect the widespread and long term decline in the inundation in the Hadejia Basin noted
in para. 6.3, which long preceded the expansion of pump and tubewell use.



93
6.7    Soil. Some soil salinity has been observed in isolated patches in areas subject to
irrigation in the two states (FACU, 1991), although none was reported in the villages
surveyed for this study. The salinity which has been observed is attributed to locally poor
water management, mainly reflecting poor drainage of the irrigated areas. To improve soil
structure and fertility the community leaders maintained that much of their household and
livestock wastes are taken to the fields for use as organic fertilizer. It is, however, likely,
that the plots near the compound receive more attention than those far away.
6.8    Chemical Contamination of Soil and Groundwater. Donli and Buahin (1994)
discovered a potentially problematic situation in their study of farmers practicing dry
season farming in Northern Nigeria and the use of agro-chemicals. In using inorganic
fertilizer, they found that farmers tended to broadcast and often used more than the
recommended amount leading to root damage, scorched leaves and sometimes loss of
disease resistance. They recognized the possibility of leaching as well as excess chemicals
in the water source.
6.9    Similarly, to control insects on their crops, farmers bought chemicals from shops
selling agricultural inputs, based on the advice of shopkeepers or their associates. In many
cases, no labels or instructions were found on the containers, raising concerns as to the
type of insecticides (if indeed they were insecticides) being purchased. Since there were
no instructions on usage, one is also concerned that farmers would use the products safely
(Donli and Buahin, 1994). The recent increases in prices of fertilizers and chemicals,
resulting from removal of subsidies and the decline in value of the Naira, may reduce the
extent of the problem as they will provide a strong incentive to farmers to avoid wastage
and to only use the amounts of the iniputs required to achieve their objective.
6.10   Cropping Patterns. In conducting the interviews, it was found that crop rotation is
not a concept with which the farmers are familiar in the abstract. In the upland areas,
intercropping is commonly practiced in wet season cropping patterns in Sokoto State.
Many farmers maintained that plots are allocated to particular crops, eg. rice fields are
only for rice. Any changes in crops reflect changes in output prices rather than rotational
considerations as so far any adverse effects have been limited. For farmers that do rotate
crops, the practice is more common with dry season than wet season crops.
6.11   However, increased crop pests and diseases were acknowledged by 74 percent of
the interviewed fadama farmers in Kano/Jigawa States and 75 percent in Sokoto/Kebbi
States. The crops most affected were grains, including wheat and millet, cowpeas and
tomatoes. Part of this problem may reflect the continued presence of host plants and
could be contained through crop rotation. Crop variety and the quality of seeds also
affects the performance of the crop and the level of resistance to attack. Similarly, seeds
reserved from the previous growing season may have reduced resistance. Input supply is
an important function of the ADP.
C. Wildlife
6.12   Data from the interviews indicated no consensus on whether there had been a
reduction in fish and wildlife over the past decade. Some thought there had been, others
did not. For example, in Bunkure, Kano State, farmers stated that indeed there were



94
more fish and wildlife than before. The Environmental Impact Assessment reported that
"in most of the sites visited wildlife were found to be almost extinct. There is no
possibility of small scale irrigation development with TW and WB having an impact on
fadama wildlife. Where there is irrigation development and increase in farming activities,
there is the likelihood of corresponding increase in the population of pests (rats, snakes
and quelea birds)." (FACU 1991). This situation presumably was a factor in the range of
views expressed by the community leaders. The EIA did recognize the importance of the
Hadejia Wetlands, downstream from Kano State, but did not believe that the anticipated
development of tubewells and washbores would have any significant impact on this area.
D. Fish and Fisheries
6.13   The EIA noted that the majority of fishermen were in fact farmers who depended
on fishing only as a supplementary source of food and income. Thus, there were no
reports of conflict between farmers and fishermen. The overall decline in annual flood on
some catchments has clearly had an effect on the composition and level of the fish
population, but the community leaders surveyed for this study were evenly split in their
responses on whether there had been a reduction in numbers in the past decade. In some
areas, however, there were reports that some people who used to rely on an income from
fishing now have to rely on other income-generating activities.
6.14   While heavy or inappropriate use of fertilizers and chemicals can cause leaching
and lead to pollution of water bodies and, therefore, adversely impact fish populations, the
levels of use in the two states are relatively low and the EIA found no evidence of such
adverse effects in the region (FACU, 1991).
E. Public Health
6.15   The EIA reported that virtually everybody in the areas suffered from malaria. The
development of small scale irrigation is likely to lead to an increase rather than a decrease
in mosquito breeding grounds. Yellow fever and schistosomiasis were also widely found,
mostly among children in farming households. Snail vectors are common where irrigation
was carried out by direct pumping from ponds or streams (FACU, 1991). Interviews with
community leaders indicated that there had been no decrease in these diseases during the
project period. However, they did report that the increased income farmers were now
receiving enabled them to more easily afford treatment when necessary, which had
reduced the adverse impacts of the diseases (para 5.33).
F. Overall Impact
6.16   The study was only able to obtain limited information on the environmental
aspects of fadama development. However, the available data indicates that, at the present
level of development, small-scale development and irrigation of these areas will have a
very limited environmental impact.

7. Conclusions
A. The Projects
7.1    Kano and Sokoto States are located in a dry sub-humid region, with agriculture
generally based on shifting cultivation and mixed/relay cropping, typical of Sub-Saharan
Africa. In addition to improving local infrastructure, the projects initially focussed
primarily on introduction of 'packages' for traditional rainfed subsistence crops. These
usually included (a) improved seed, (b) use of fertilizer and agro-chemicals, and (c)
improved husbandry in sole cropping systems. Results were disappointing, and were a
major reason for the unsatisfactory ratings of several of the ADPs in the cluster audit.
The principal reasons were supply problems with seeds and fertilizer, and an inability to
come up with technologies which were suited to the farmers' mixed/relay cropping systems.
7.2    However, the data obtained by this study indicates that the extension service
supported under the Kano and Sokoto projects did make farmers aware of alternative
technologies. The resources made available under the projects for extension led to a
much lower agent-to-farmer ratio than before and, for the first time, ensured that many
farmers were periodically visited with timely and relevant extension messages. There is no
doubt that the ADPs have greatly facilitated farmers' access to agricultural information.
The results of this study also indicate that the VEAs have won the confidence of the
farmers, since a majority of the farmers interviewed stated that they considered the ADPs
to be the most trustworthy source of information. Almost all of those farmers
interviewed, who are now using several new technologies, began their use during the
project period and indicated that they learned of it from the ADP. In that sense, the
extension effort was successful. Clearly, the shortcoming was that some of the
technologies were not well adapted to meet the farmers' priorities.
7.3    Nevertheless, there are still areas, particularly in remote locations, that are
neglected as VEAs tend to concentrate their attention in easily accessible or nearby
communities. Whether a farmer was a contact farmer or not was not always a determiner
of the frequency of the VEAs visits. Because of this, not all farmers were given the same
messages on a regular basis, despite the directive that all contact farmers should be visited
fortnightly.
B. The Fadama Components
7.4    The fadama components, however, managed to avoid the characteristic limitations.
This was partly fortuitous, but also reflected an effective response by the ADPs to an
opportunity. There was an initial pressure for an effort to assist those fadama areas which
had been adversely affected by dam construction. There appear to have been four major
aspects to the success of this program; (a) the existence of a substantial market for
products which became feasible using the technology; (b) initial incentives for adoption,
including the reduction in risk of crop failure; (c) suitability of the technologies for use by



96
the individual farmer; and (d) improvements made in the technologies by the ADPs to
enhance their attractiveness to farmers.
7.5   (a) Demand. On the demand side the introduction of pumps and tubewells
enabled farmers to respond to the increasing demand for crops such as tomatoes, onions,
peppers, and garlic. During the later 1980s, FGN also encouraged production of wheat
through high guaranteed prices and this provided an alternative dry season crop for
farmers. This policy has been subsequently terminated, and wheat is now a minor crop.
7.6   It has been claimed that the growth of the vegetable market was somewhat
fortuitous in that, when the importation of fertilizer by the northern ADPs was built up in
the mid-eighties, it was shipped to the north by road. This resulted in a considerable
unused truck capacity on the return trips to Lagos. Some enterprising growers and traders
took advantage of this and started to ship back tomatoes etc. Volume expanded to the
point where it attracted additional transport capacity. As noted, the major FGN
investments in trunk highways supported this development, and project improvement of
rural roads by the ADPs further improved access to some fadama areas.
7.7   (b) Incentives. Only half of the ADP staff interviewed characterized the initial
farmer response to motor pumps as 'enthusiastic' as discussed in Chapter 4. Particularly in
Sokoto, response to tubewells was mixed; there only one in seven of the respondents
considered it to have been enthusiastic. During the demonstration phase wells were
drilled in areas the ADPs considered promising, and made available to farmers. However,
because of poor data on ground conditions, several wells were dry or had poor yields.
One survey indicated that one year after drilling about 40 percent of the wells in one zone
in Sokoto were still unused, even though there had been initial expressions of interest by
farmers.
7.8    Over time, as the economic benefits became more apparent (aided by the highly
subsidized availability of tubewells and pumps), the technologies did take off. These
benefits included both the increased security of food production and the ability to produce
vegetables, etc. for sale in the dry season. However, in many respects the final success of
the technology was as much out of the hands of the projects, as with any of the other
technologies promoted by them. In fact, perhaps more so, as without the development of
the market, the technologies would have remained not more than a "good idea."
7.9   (c) Suitability. Some initial effort was made to promote group ownership, but data
from the survey indicated that very few pumps and wells are owned in this way. In fact, in
retrospect, one advantage of the tubewell, pump and washbore technologies was that they
were suitable for ownership and use by an individual farmer. In particular, the flexibility
of the washbore technology makes it ideally suited to use by a single farmer where
physical conditions permit it. As a result, each farmer was committed to the proper use
and care of the equipment that belonged to him and from which he could directly benefit
if it were properly handled.
7.10   While farmers have demonstrated willingness to share the use of their pumps and
wells with others, they reserved the right to determine when and how they would be used,
and to reap the benefits or otherwise of their decisions. The frequent misuse of common



97
property, which is often considered everyone's opportunity and no one's responsibility,
was, therefore, avoided with the decentralized adoption pattern. Each farmer's potential
and his ability to reap benefits were then based upon his efforts and, for most of them,
not dependent upon close collaboration with his neighbor.
7.11   (d) Adaptation. Initially, the projects promoted both manual pump for low-lift use
and diesel pumps (envisaged as suitable for group use). However, it became apparent that
neither of these technologies was particularly attractive. One demanded too much heavy
labor, the other was inflexible. Farmers were more interested in small gasoline engines
and the projects quickly switched to these. Similarly, the ADPs introduced the washbore
technology after the tubewell, and have sought to improve it as its attractiveness to
farmers has become apparent. Thus, there has been a 'bottom-up' evolution of the
technology. At the same time the initial introduction of the technology and its adaptation
drew heavily on experience with tubewells, etc. in other parts of the world and
represented effective use of TA-related skills.
C. A Parallel Case
7.12  In a recent article on the role of technology in agricultural intensification, Smith
et. al. (1994) discuss the development of maize production in Northern Nigeria. They
conclude that "contrary to conventional wisdom, 'quantum leap' technologies have a vital
role to play in West Africa, if targeted carefully at areas where the right conditions exist."
They also "caution that, while technological breakthroughs are crucial, they need to be
situated within a technology strategy that seeks to achieve both productivity and
sustainability of the agroecosystem as a whole."
7.13   The impact of the fadama development components may be seen in this same
context. Smith et. al. review the adoption of hybrid maize in the late 1970s and early
1980s, in the slightly more humid zone just to the south of Kano and Sokoto states. In
the mid-1970s maize was a minor crop mainly grown as in backyards for own consumption.
At that time the major food crops in this region were sorghum and millet, and groundnuts
and cotton were the predominant cash crops. However, by the end of the 1980s maize had
become a major cash and food crop in much of the region.
7.14   Rapid adoption of maize appears to have begun in the late 1970s, when several
exogenous factors came into play:
(a)    an improved variety, TZB, which was well adapted to the region, became
available;
(b)   the initial enclave ADPs began in this region. They promoted TZB among
other packages, which included fertilizers, and which clearly demonstrated the benefits of
the variety;
(c)   fertilizer was highly subsidized, and availability improved, partly as a result
of the ADPs; and



98
(d)    the highway construction program, funded by the increased oil revenues,
significantly reduced transport costs to the main markets in the south.
7.15   Not surprisingly, these factors closely parallel those discussed above in connection
with the fadama program. However, one fact which should be noted is that in the case of
maize, while it was actively promoted by the ADPs, these projects were only operative in
three small enclaves, yet improved maize spread rapidly throughout the region. This
illustrates yet again that, "when a technology meets farmers' needs, its dissemination is
possible with minimal extension." (Smith et. al. p 547).
7.16   In the fadama case, the support from the ADP, and the fact that by the 1980s the
programs were operating state wide, may have been more important in ensuring
widespread adoption of the pumps etc., than it was for maize. This report has shown how
the evidence suggests that the majority of the farmers purchasing pumps, in the early years
in particular, obtained those imported by the projects. In addition, since this technology
requires a significant up-front investment in equipment, in contrast to the production of
maize, subsidized equipment (or access to cheap credit) is likely to be more significant in
inducing farmers to take the plunge. Also, since most of the vegetables etc produced with
the pump technology are more perishable than grains, and lacked traditional marketing
channels, the level of uncertainty facing the early adopters was high. In addition, the
support of ADPs in improving local tubewell technology, and subsequently in introducing
the washbore technology, was essential.
D. Lessons and Implications
1. Technology and Extension
7.17   Both the maize and fadama examples indicate that introduction of a technology
that appears better than existing ones, does not assure its adoption. Both were, in Smith
et. al's terminology, 'quantum leap technologies'. However, exogenous factors, especially
those related to the conditions which are critical in providing an incentive to produce, are
invariably outside the control, or major influence, of the project, or of those involved in
technology development.
7.18   Smith, et. al. imply the need for focus in technology development efforts.
Technologies "need to be carefully targeted to areas where the preconditions for
intensification exist" (p. 553). However, as we have seen, there is a considerable element
of chance in whether a particular technology will be attractive to farmers, especially under
conditions of great economic uncertainty and change such as is typical of SSA. Therefore,
too great an emphasis on targeting may not be desirable. This appears to have a number
of implications for extension related operations such as the ADPs:
(a)   there is a need to approach issues of technologies from a broad perspective
as it is difficult to assess where success is likely to arise 5 - 10 years in advance;
(b)    particular emphasis might be placed on areas of innovation which show
potential for products with a high income elasticity of demand, or which create



99
opportunities to produce such items since (assuming growth) demand for them will expand
rapidly; and
(c)    there is a need for flexibility in the organization and an ability to follow up
on success, and to modify technologies to increase their suitability for those interested,
when promising conditions are met, as has been the case in the fadama program studied
here.
7.19 At the same time, given the reality of escalating costs in Nigeria and the increasing
pressure on the national budget, the existing ADP structure with the T & V extension
system may not be economically sustainable with the costs of frequent village visits by a
large number of VEAs. In the early stages of the projects, frequent visits by the agents
were necessary not only to introduce and demonstrate new technologies, but also establish
rapport. Such frequent visits may be less important now since the farmers are more
familiar with the notion of change and new technologies than they were two decades ago.
The farmers surveyed for this study indicated that they looked to a variety of sources for
information on agricultural problems, including the mass media, although they viewed the
ADP extension agent as the most trustworthy. The ADPs have, in fact, responded to this
by sponsoring and supporting radio programs.
7.20   These conclusions may imply that:
(a)    there may be scope for expanding the use of radio and other mass media
outlets, while reducing somewhat the frequency of extension agent contact at the farm
level. Quality may be more important than quantity now for agent/farmer interaction.
(b)    on the other hand there may be a need to increase the focus at the level
above the field worker, the subject matter specialist. This is the point at which
modifications to the 'messages' have to be formulated, and this level is important in
determining the ability to develop flexible responses, as in the fadama program.
2. Livestock and Intensification
7.21   The key issues in the project regions are the continued intensification of
agriculture, and the maintenance of the resource base. Both the maize and fadama
technologies had significant impact in facilitating further intensification. To some degree
the fadama technologies which have been the subject of this report were more powerful in
that they opened up a whole range of possibilities for the farmers, which they have been
gradually building upon. Intensification here means a movement away from the fallow
based systems towards continuous cultivation systems. The keys to this are methods to
maintain soil nutrient status and improve soil structure. An important element is the
ability to recycle organic matter, a process in which increased use of livestock has usually
been an important factor.
7.22   Farmers in Kano and Sokoto have displayed an interest in livestock. The large
majority of those interviewed indicated that they had increased their numbers of animals
over the past decade. The majority of farmers surveyed in this study indicated that they
used oxen for cultivation of uplands. The Fulani had also increased their herds. A recent



100
study investigated livestock numbers over several regions of West Africa, (including most
of Nigeria) using data generated by low level aerial reconnaissance and complementary
ground studies (Bourn and Wint, 1994). This indicated a significant relationship between
livestock biomass and the intensity of land use. That is, that increased cultivation is
accompanied by greater livestock numbers, rather than displacing them.3 The 1990
National Livestock Survey of Nigeria also demonstrated that livestock populations were
far more numerous and more widely distributed than was generally recognized, and also
reported widespread use of animal traction and of fattening of livestock by smallholders.
7.23   However, despite the fact that almost all farmers raise livestock and their potential
importance in intensifying agriculture, the Kano and Sokoto ADPs did not include
components related to livestock. This appears to have been an important omission in
three further ways:
(a)    relations between the Fulani and other groups are the major social issue
resulting from greater use of fadama land for crop production. The presence of
components directed towards livestock might have helped the projects improve their
contacts with the Fulani, and, perhaps act as one channel for reducing the level of friction
which has arisen. As it is, the Fulani do not see the ADPs as having any benefits for them
(see Chapter 5) and in fact, see the structure and focus of the ADPs as just one more
indication that Government etc. consider their problems to be of little consequence.
(b)    under most conditions, in low-income societies such as Nigeria, there is a
high income elasticity of demand for livestock products, so that they represent an area of
market opportunity as the economy grows; and
(c)    animal traction is still attractive as a means of increasing productivity per
man hour, even if yields are not increasing.
7.24   At present, with veterinary services (the area of greatest interest to the Fulani)
being provided by a different service, there is no one part of the bureaucracy that can
form a bridge between the major groups involved. A small pilot operation has been
initiated by the ongoing Bank-supported Livestock Project, which is channeling support to
Fulani through the ADP structure. The results of this study strongly support this initiative
which, if expanded, would imply bringing expertise on livestock management into the
ADPs, and force livestock and crop specialists to work more closely together. This would
also have the advantage of facilitating the development of 'packages' etc. in support of the
development of mixed farming systems (eg. development of fodder crops and use of
residues).
3. There may, however, clearly be a change in livestock husbandry methods and a displacement of those, such as the nomadic
Fulani, using extensive methods.



101
3. Women
7.25   The survey indicated general satisfaction among the women in improvements over
the past decade, and did not indicate any evidence of discontent over adverse
consequences of the changes which have occurred. However, the technologies which have
been introduced over this period were developed without the internal needs of the
households in the project areas in mind. That the results appear to have been relatively
benign so far does not guarantee that this will continue. Given the nature of the social
setting, the creation of the Women in Agriculture (WIA) program under the ADPs was
desirable, and has helped to reach women with information and technology for enhancing
their productivity. While some evidence exists that workloads may have increased, women
recognized that the benefits obtained justified the effort.
7.26  It is important to recognize that, in Northern Nigeria, despite good intentions,
rural women cannot be fully integrated into development strategies if this demands equal
participation and interaction with men. Through their group activities, however, rural
northern women can obtain opportunities that would otherwise not be available to them.
ADP staff in general, and not only WIA staff, must be sensitive to the gender activities in
the rural areas, recognizing that rural women do own land and manage farms, and
therefore, should not be left out of agricultural development efforts. Strategies to
effectively incorporate their unique potentials and constraints need to be innovative and
flexible.
4. The Role of ADPs in Fadama Development
7.27   The activities of ADPs have supported the rapid spread of the use of pump and
tubewell technology through much of Northern Nigeria. The presence of thousands of
pumps has further provided an opportunity for the creation of employment opportunities
in pump maintenance. ADPs have also contracted locally for well drilling and this is being
further promoted under the ongoing NFDP. Pumps imported under NFDP financing are
being sold on to farmers at essentially full cost. In the longer term there is no reason why
the importation of pumps, etc. should not be entirely in the private sector, and this is an
objective which underlies the ongoing NFDP. However, in the short term, difficulties of
access to foreign exchange limit the ability of the private sector to import directly, and
importation by ADPs can ensure an adequate flow of equipment to allow continued
investment by farmers.
7.28   The findings of the survey made clear that there has been very little joint
ownership of either pumps and tubewells in the project areas. In fact, the suitability of
these technologies for individual ownership and use was clearly a factor on the production
side which has stimulated their uptake. Tubewell irrigation has been extensively used in
other regions of the world, especially South Asia. Attempts in the last decade to develop
'more efficient' group operated wells have achieved only very limited success. Unless
water is available almost on demand (as from an individual well) conflict soon arises and
allocation systems break down. In most of the areas in which this has been attempted,
aquifers are large and, therefore, benefits of collaboration are difficult to see. However,
since many of the aquifers being used in Northern Nigeria are relatively small, there will
have to be some action to ensure that extraction rates do not become too great and to



102
begin to monitor and manage the available supply. However, this is not yet a problem
perceived by farmers, as declining watertables due to heavy pumping was not reported by
farmers or others in the present study.
7.29   The ongoing NFDP is organizing Fadama Users Associations (FUAs) to serve as a
link between ADPs, etc. and farmers, which in the long run could provide a vehicle for
addressing these issues. In particular, pumps, etc. are being supplied to farmers on credit
through the FUAs with the credit being guaranteed by the group. However, there are two
aspects of this effort which may work counter to the objectives of privatizing the provision
of pumps and tubewells. First, given the tendency of farmers to avoid group operations,
there will have to be some benefit to the farmers through purchasing equipment, etc.
through the FUAs to make it worth their while, eg. easy repayment terms. Second,
whereas when a farmer goes to the market to buy a pump he can choose from whatever
makes and models are available, when he purchases from the ADP he has to take
whatever make and model has won the particular contract awarded by that ADP.
7.30   Developing the FUAs, or their equivalents, as viable actors will not be easy. If
farmers are pushed in to them as a quid pro quo for benefits, eg. cheap credit, they are
unlikely to feel strongly committed to them. More indirect ADP efforts, designed to
facilitate individual or group actions, may be most effective. For example, measures to
improve the understanding of the hydrology of the fadama areas, eg. drilling to establish
the structure and extent of aquifers, and follow-up monitoring, as is being undertaken
under the NFDP, will provide a vehicle for showing farmers the nature of the water
resources they are using and the need for joint efforts in management. Similarly,
provision of information about crop conditions and likely output, especially local areas
with ample supplies, would assist in creating greater competition in local markets and
improve farmers' returns.
5. Program Funding
7.31   The findings of the study, especially on the desirability of a broad approach to
agricultural innovation and technologies (eg. including the desirability of including some
livestock services through ADP channels) also raise some issues as to the effect of reliance
on external funding and its packaging. Given the scarcity of funds, the approach of
focussing external funding on clearly defined, subsectoral packages (eg. the NFDP), runs a
risk of reducing the ability of the extension and service system to be able to adopt a broad
approach, and to reduce the ability of the system to respond flexibly to new opportunities,
in the way that the Kano and Sokoto Projects were able to respond to the rapid growth in
demand for pumps and tubewells. There is also the danger, pointed out frequently in the
case of external funding of research, that the balance of funding reflects the perceived
priorities of those providing the finance rather than the priorities of the ultimate
beneficiaries.

Fadama Physical Characteristics and Ecology'
A. Description
1.    In the northern states, the fadamas are mainly low-lying flood plains composed of
fluvial deposits and containing extensive exploitable aquifers, but generally, any low-lying
seasonally flooded area is known as a fadama. Major fadamas occur along the flood plains
of the Niger, Sokoto-Rima, Benue and Yobe river systems. They vary in width from a few
hundred meters to as much as 20 km and encompass the land and water resources that
could be developed for irrigated agriculture. Fadama formation is a geomorphological
phenomenon that has resulted from the combination of slow river bed accretion and
periods of high rainfall that caused extensive, high velocity flooding and deposition of
sorted materials over the flood plains. These materials vary in thickness from about one
meter to seven or eight meters. Deposition of sediments was accompanied by a rise in the
base levels of the rivers. The shallow aquifers constituted by the sands generally lie below
the flood levels and are hydraulically connected to river systems. Many are thus subject to
recharge during the wet season floods.
2.     Ecology. Fadamas are remarkably different from adjacent uplands in terms of their
ecology and micro-climate. They are low-lying,flood-prone, slow-draining areas and
generally possess finer textured and less acid soils. These factors have resulted in fadazna
soils with a markedly different moisture regime from upland soils. As a result, the natural
vegetation cover has been characterized by a composite of thick acacia scrubland, open
grassland and open seasonally or permanently ponded areas with sedges and reeds.
Traditional use of fadamas by pastoralists and their herds as well as by settled agriculturists
and fishermen has had a dramatic effect on the ecology. The original scrub has been
replaced in many places by grasslands. The land adjacent to the numerous villages that
dot the margins of fadamas has been entirely cleared for arable farming and is available to
pastoralists only after the crops are harvested. The retained moisture in the fadama soils
as well as their relative fertility, due in part to seasonal flooding in the past, supports good
quality fodder well into the dry season, when the uplands resources would have been
largely exhausted. They thus form an essential element in the pasturing cycle of
pastoralists. Farmers have traditionally worked in river margins of the fadamas, where
they could raise water with shadoufs to irrigate small parcels of vegetables and rice.
3.     Extensive shallow depressional ponds, that are a feature of some fadamas, receive
flood waters in the wet season and retain it well into the dry season. Fish of various
species migrate into ponded areas with in-flowing water and find an ample supply of feed
in vegetable matter and insects that have colonized the area in dry periods. As a result of

Bank, 1992.

this migration of fish, many of the settlements in and along the margins of fadamas have
come to depend on fish as an important dietary component. It is also probable that these
wetlands provided, and continue to provide at a reduced level, an important habitat for
waterfowl and other migratory palearctic species. They also pay an important role in the
recharge of the shallow groundwater system through infiltration. As ponded water dries
out, the inhabitants of the area cultivate the margins to produce rice and vegetables. Thus
in many communities along the fadamas people have practiced dual occupations of
agriculture and fishing. Recent changes in river regimes brought about by dams and by
cyclic or permanent climatic changes have drastically reduced the area, depth and duration
of annual floodings. This has affected communities which depended on these ponded
fadamas for fish and cultivable wetlands. It has also reduced the habitat area for
migratory birds and other wildlife.
B. Ecological Impact of Fadama Use
4.     During the past two decades, the state and federal governments have embarked on
an ambitious program of dam construction in Northern Nigeria with the intent of using
reservoirs to support large scale irrigation projects on fadama and adjacent dryland areas.
Over thirty dams have been constructed in the three project states with the largest being
Bakolori Dam in Sokoto State. Further dam construction is being planned. These dams
were not subjected to environmental assessment prior to construction. The ecological
changes within these highly productive floodplains are far-reaching, mostly with adverse
environmental, social and economic effects. For a variety of reasons, irrigation
development did not occur at expected rates and presently, most of the reservoirs are
either not utilized or are under-utilized for irrigation. Except for Bakolori, none of the
dams were designed for hydropower generation.
5.     Although formal irrigation systems resulting from the dams were established with
the anticipation that they would yield large-scale agricultural increases of economic
significance, the reality appears to be quite different and disturbing. Dittoh (1991) has
demonstrated that informal irrigation systems have been found to be more economically
efficient than formal ones. Barbier et al (1991: 24) agree:
"When compared to the net economic benefits of an upstream water development
project such as the Kano River Project Phase I, the economic returns to the
floodplain appear to be much more favorable. This is particularly the case when
the relative returns to the Project in terms of water input use is compared to that
of the floodplain system. This result should cause some concern, given that the
existing and planned water developments along the Hadejia-Jama'are River system,
such as the Kano River Project, are currently and will continue diverting water
from the floodplain. The failure to take into account the opportunity cost of this
water diversion in terms of the forgone benefits of floodplain production may be
leading to serious over-estimation of the net economic returns to these
development projects".



105                                 Annex I
The problems identified above for the Hadejia Jama'are and Yobe floodplains are similar
to those found in the Sokoto-Rima Basin and others. the choices to be made in water
usage involve trade-offs for limited water between competing potential and existing water
users both upstream and downstream.
6.     The dams have significantly altered the floodplain hydrology. Annual floods still
occur, but at reduced intensity and duration. As a consequence, recession agriculture on
the floodplain has been seriously curtailed, both in respect to area under cultivation and
the market value of crops being planted. The lower river level also may have had
detrimental effects on groundwater levels. At lower river level, lateral groundwater
movement toward the river would cause more rapid flood recession than it would have
occurred before the rivers were regulated by dams and reservoirs. This premature
draining of groundwater to the river reduces the amount of residual soil moisture available
for dry season cropping.
7.     For instance, in some places where farmers previously cultivated wet season rice,
they are now obliged to cultivate sorghum or millet owing to the reduced flood water and
the consequent loss of residual soil moisture. Recharge of the underlying aquifer still
takes place, but in a more restricted zone along the river. Since environmental studies
were not conducted prior to dam construction, there are no baseline data on the
floodplain hydrology from which to make an accurate comparison of hydrological, or for
that matter, agricultural changes. However, anecdotal evidence gained from farmer
interviews in the floodplain makes it clear that the changes were not beneficial either
socially or economically. The impacts on areas below the dams, and their impact on
cropping were a significant element in creating interest among farmers in finding
alternative means of assuring water supplies for fadamas in the dry season.

River Bottomland Development in Sub-Saharan Africa
Background
1.     A major theme in agricultural development policy in Sub-saharan Africa has been
the problems related to population growth, particularly the increasing area under
agricultural use. This expansion has resulted in reduction of the period under fallow in
the traditional shifting cultivation systems.
2.     Much of the African landscape is unspectacular and relatively flat. This may give
an impression of uniformity. This is not so. Parts of the landscape are relatively high, with
a tendency for water to drain away from them. Conversely, other parts are lower and
receive water. Thus, in much of SSA, while rainfall is relatively low (especially in relation
to evapo-transpiration) significant areas have a water table which is relatively high for all
or a significant part of the year. (in Zimbabwe this has been estimated as 15 percent).
3.     With low population densities the traditional shifting cultivation systems generally
met subsistence needs. Even with high interyear rainfall variability, storage could pretty
much take care of production variations for staple grains. Wetter areas were not much
used for cropping in these systems. Reasons may include:
-      soils are often heavier and more difficult to work;
-      with tsetse and other disease load, animal traction has not been widely
used;
-      valley bottoms were often viewed as being unhealthy because of water
related diseases such as bilharzia, onchocerciasis and others related to
swamps or stagnant water.
-      seasonally flooded areas have often used as significant sources of animal
fodder. Traditionally many of these areas have been kept for grazing.
4.     As population growth continues and fallow periods shorten, two other changes
appear to occur. Off-farm markets for agricultural products increase and, as access to
them improves, interest in cash cropping increases. At the same time farmer interest in
valley bottom also increases. The latter areas have several aspects to make them
attractive to farmers:
-      using them for cropping reduces seasonal cropping risk. Valley areas will
have higher probability of producing a crop in a dry year.
-      in an average year a second crop can often be produced during the dry
season from residual moisture (or with a little simple irrigation). This is
attractive for production of horticultural crops for home consumption or
sale. This also helps even out interseasonal labor requirements.



Annex 2                                  108
5.     External experts, seeing the greater reliability of water supply in these areas and,
therefore, likely better conditions for higher yielding varieties, have looked on these areas
as having a potential role in intensifying agriculture. In particular, some have seen these
areas as having potential for continuous cropping, where, because of water availability,
some of the standard concerns about short fallow periods do not apply. As a result,
efforts to increase agricultural production, including Bank funded projects, have often
included elements to encourage the greater use of these areas.
Bank Projects
6.     Numbers. A review of data from PCRs for the 300 Bank financed agricultural
projects completed in SSA to date indicated that 43 of them (about 14 percent) have
included components aimed at increasing the intensity of use of bottomlands. A listing of
the projects, and of the nature of the activities undertaken, is given in Attachment 1.
Most of these projects were area development type operations. One noteworthy feature
is a sharp distinction between the former Eastern and Western Africa Regions:
Total                With                Percent
Agricultural         Bottomland
Projects           Component
Total Africa                 300                   42                   14
of which:
Western Africa               145                   37                   31
Eastern Africa               155                   5                    3
[This grouping of projects with bottomland components does not include straightforward
irrigation projects or components, except 'micro-level' irrigation.]
7.     The reasons for this inter-regional difference would have to be investigated but
may include:
areas with greatest population pressure in East Africa are highlands; (eg
Kenya highlands, Rwanda, Burundi), where bottomlands are less common,
whereas in the more populated areas of West Africa seasonally flooded or
waterlogged valley bottoms are a much more significant element in the
landscape;
there has been an argument that valley bottoms should not be developed
because of their importance as wildlife habitat and in maintaining regularity
of streamflow and water quality downstream, especially as intensity of
upland cultivation increases. This view was most widely held in colonial



109                                 Annex 2
British territories, especially in E Africa, where it was pushed by settler
representatives and wildlife people. It was put into law in Rhodesia
(Zimbabwe) where cultivation in 'dambos' was illegal and grazing restricted.
Some restrictions continued after independence.
8.     7ype of Component. There have been a range of operations involving different
degrees of land and water management. For this study we have not included purely
irrigation projects. We have included components involving small scale irrigation, eg.
several small schemes of up to about 20 ha each, and also a small group of projects which
attempted to use flood protection polders. Given these 'outer limits', the project
components included in the study may be divided into three types:
-      bottomland development - water control
-      micro-irrigation/polders
-      swamp drainage
9.    The division of the projects identified was as follows:
Bottomland Development                    24
Micro-irrigation/polders                  6
Swamp Development                         11
Others                                    2
Total                              43
10.   Swamp drainage operations have primarily been carried out in the humid regions
of west Africa; i.e., areas with rainfalls above 1,800 to 2,000 mm of annual rainfall in
Sierra Leone, Guinea, Liberia and Nigeria.
Results
11.   In most of the projects the bottomland development components are a relatively
small share of total project cost, usually less than 25 percent. As a result the cost of the
component is often not specified in the PCR. Data on the results vary widely but
commonly there is an indication of the achievement of the physical target, in most cases
the number of hectares to be developed/improved.
12.   For a preliminary assessment of the success of these components they have been
divided, to the extent possible, into 5 categories:
Highly successful   -       > 100% of target
Successful          -       80% - 99%
Partially successful   -   50% - 79%
Unsuccessful         -     20% - 49%
Failed/abandoned     -      <20%



Annex 2                                   110
13.    Table A2.1 shows the numbers and distribution of these outcomes by component
type. Overall, 29 percent of projects were successful (achieved 80 percent or more of
their physical targets by closing), 24 percent were partially successful (50-79 percent), and
47 percent were unsuccessful. Relatively speaking, the swamp development efforts were
most successful, only 36 percent failures, and the irrigation/polder components the least
successful, 83 percent failure. In the latter group all the three projects based on the use
of polders failed.
14.    However, these results may overstate the results of the activities. There is
anecdotal evidence, for example, that a significant proportion of the swamp areas drained
have been abandoned after the completion of the project, and that the same may apply to
the other areas.
15.    Conversely, one group of projects which were conspicuously successful were three
in Northern Nigeria in which the project financed and otherwise assisted in the drilling of
tubewells and provision of pumps in valley bottom (fadama) areas. In these cases the
initial targets were substantially exceeded.

Methodology for the Field Survey
1.    Based on the study objective and the various factors and actors identified as important to
understanding the impact of the ADPs upon fadama development in Kano and Sokoto States, a
multi-method approach was adopted, combining the use of both quantitative and qualitative, as
well as primary and secondary, data.
2.     Use of secondary data. Significant attention has been given to fadama development in
recent years, as its potential for agricultural production has been recognized. The independent
research papers etc. which have resulted have been drawn on as background to the field work and
incorporated into the analysis.
3.    The ADPs have also given some priority to gathering data on production in the fadama
areas and the use of improved technology, such as tubewells and pumps. However, the quality of
the data is of a variable level of reliability. For example, in most cases, baseline data, specific to
the fadama areas, is missing. It is in recent years, particularly since 1990, with the preparation
and implementation of the NFDP, that more attention from the Monitoring and Evaluation
(M&E) Units has been focussed upon fadama farmers and their dry season agricultural activities.
4.     Nevertheless, a thorough search of existing project documents and information yielded
significant information. In some cases, such as the Central Zone of Sokoto ADP (SADP) during
the period of 1986-88, more studies appear to have been conducted than in other zones.
Unfortunately, the uneven and variable coverage means that one cannot make rigorous
comparisons between one area and another from studies conducted during the same time period.
5.     Primnary data gathered. The major component of the study consisted of gathering primary
data through interviewing a purposively selected sample of just over 250 fadama farmers, twenty
key informants from the ADPs themselves, and twenty community leaders of villages visited, as
well as 16 Fulani pastoralists who were available and willing to be interviewed. To complement
the resulting quantitative data, a limited number of Focus Group Discussions (FGDs) were also
held separately with groups of rural men and women, to identify areas where there may be gender
or status differences in responses. The FGDs gave the opportunity to explore certain areas in
greater depth and determine the degree of consensus on important issues. The methods used are
summarized in Table 2.1. Data on the samples drawn are shown in Tables A3.2 and A3.3
6.    It was originally intended to undertake a two stage survey. Initially a sample of about 20
villages with access to fadama land would be drawn to provide a coverage of the physical
conditions of the two project areas, including villages with extensive and limited adoption of the
technologies. Data would be sought from village leaders, agricultural extension agents, and focus
groups on; (a) the extent of adoption of pump and tubewell technology; (b) the progress of
adoption and factors related to this experience; (c) the extent of group operation of pumps and
wells; (d) the principal changes in the villages over the past decade and a half; and (e) other
activities in the villages supported or stimulated by the projects. Then, as a second stage, a



Annex 3                                     114
sample of farmers would be drawn from within a subset of the villages in order to obtain a
reasonable cross section of the project experience. A sample of about 25 farmers in each of ten
villages was envisaged, and data would be sought on; (a) current cropping pattern and production;
(b) changes following the introduction of pumps and tubewells; (c) livestock production and use;
(d) use of labor in the household; and (e) the perception of change over the past decade. The
results of the first stage village would be used to fine-tune the farmer questionnaire.
7.    To select the sampled villages from which the respondents were drawn, four criteria were
used:
(a) roughly equal numbers from each of the four new states and the ADP zones within
the states;
(b) geographical spread, so as to include both areas close to towns and major highways,
and less accessible areas, as determined from maps;
(c) representation of areas of both high and low fadama development potential; and
(d) localities with early ADP attention in this program, as well as those without.
The latter two criteria were determined by a combination of secondary information and advice
from ADP staff.
B.    Unfortunately, because of the marked deterioration of country conditions in mid-1994,
particularly with increasing uncertainty over the availability and cost of fuel and transport, this
approach had to be abandoned. In order to reduce transport needs both parts of the survey were
undertaken at the same time, so as to ensure that sub-project areas were fully covered. In the
event, abnormally heavy rains and flooding also hampered travel, and it was fortunate that the two
stage approach was not adopted. However, this did mean that there was not an opportunity to
narrow and tighten the farmer survey. Overall, however, with this caveat, the numbers and types
of interviews obtained were approximately as envisaged, and provide an adequate cross section of
the project areas.
9.    Table A3.1 lists the inventory of indicators used for the study and the sources of
information, whether secondary or primary data, used to come up with a composite picture of the
changes that resulted from the intervention of the ADP. It should be noted that the overlap of
data from different sources is intentional as a way of supporting or disputing the conclusions
reached from one group, and gaining additional insights from all of the relevant participants in the
process of agricultural development.
Limitations of the Study
10.   One of the biggest challenges in an impact evaluation is to determine the areas in which
change has taken place, to what extent the intervention was responsible for the changes that have
occurred and that these changes would not have happened even if the intervention had not taken
place. The task has been compounded in this study for two reasons: first of all, the lack of a



115                                    Annex 3
baseline survey at the time of project inception that would focus upon fadama farming; and
secondly, the continuation of ADP activities after the completion date, specifically in the area of
fadama development, through the NFDP. Certainly, the NFDP itself is a consequence of the
1981-82 to 1988-89 project, but it complicates the analysis of the impact of a specific project when
farmers sometimes have difficulty differentiating between the two programs.
11.   The lack of a baseline study necessitates the reliance upon recall by the farmers, which
can be difficult, given the relatively long period of 10-12 years that has elapsed. The respondents
may also sometimes give answers which they feel are "sociallydesirable" given the perceived
advantages of dry season farming, the popularity of the NFDP, and the enthusiasm it has
generated. It was often difficult to get accurate information on quantitative variables such as size
of farm, income and yield. This is not a unique problem to this study as it is common to most
research that relies upon a one visit interview for data collection among nonliterate rural
residents, who do not keep records, and who may be unfamiliar with standard measures.

Notes
Geographic Areas
Given the time frame of the project implementation, a constraint has resulted from the
political and administrative changes that have occurred in Nigeria since 1981. A number of new
states and Local Government Areas (LGAs) have been created out of existing ones. This
complicates the comparability of data when dealing with land areas that may have been bifurcated
or merged in the last 15 years. The land area designated as Kano State in 1982, became Kano
and Jigawa States in August, 1991, while Sokoto State was also divided into Sokoto and Kebbi
States. Even more complicated changes have occurred with the structure of LGAs. For example,
in 1982, there were 6 LGAs in the Central Zone of Sokoto State. In 1983, the Federal Military
Government merged some LGAs nationwide, resulting in 4 LGAs in the Zone: Sakaba/Wasagu
was merged with and became part of Zuru LGA, while Tambuwal became part of Yabo LGA. In
1991, with the creation of new states and LGAs, these areas again became separate administrative
units, but the Zone was then divided with some areas belonging in Kebbi State and others
remaining in Sokoto State. Since the secondary data comes from different times in the project
era, areas with the same name do not always refer to the same geographical entity.
The Difficulties of Obtaining Estimates of Land Area
An attempt was made in the survey to assess the areas of upland and fadama land
operated, but it soon became clear that there was no consistent measure of area in the regions
surveyed, and there were problems in getting exact areas of land from the respondents. As a
result, the data from this study are handled as approximations only. During the data collection,
some farmers referred to the use of gLra in giving their size of land (3 gora = about 1 acre), or
the number of ridges (50 ridges = about I acre). In Table 3.2 data from sampled fadama farmers
is given in regard to the source of their land and the number of plots of upland, as well as fadama
land, they own. The size of plot may vary, however, as one farmer estimated that his plot was
about 10 hectares, while another farmer stated that he had nearly 50 plots, all of which totalled
about 20 acres of land.

Techniques of Small-scale Irrigation in Fadamas'
1.     Based on the shallow aquifer surveys and other studies, FACU  has estimated that
in the middle and northern zone states about 3.14 million ha are available in the fadanas
out of which about 2.06 million ha are potentially irrigable using the three types of small-
scale irrigation techniques compared to a potential of 200,000 ha from irrigation
schemes.2
2.     Crop production in the fadamas has traditionally depended on rainfall in the wet
season and on residual moisture after flood recession in the dry season. In areas with
easily accessible shallow groundwater or surface water, traditional water lifting devices,
such as shadouf and calabash, are used to lift water onto the land. While such devices are
low cost and depend mostly on farmer labor for construction and operation, their
irrigation potential is limited to small plots. Water lifting by such devices is laborious and
the irrigated area is limited to about 0.1 ha per shadouf.
Controlled Flooding
3.     While irrigation makes the fadamas productive in the dry season, flooding and
water recession have been the basis for a very active agriculture in extensive natural
depressions and oxbows. Water retained in these locations, sometimes well into the dry
season, has provided habitat for fish, birds and other wildlife. This generally uncontrolled
flooding of the fadamas has diminished, largely as a result of the construction of upstream
dam projects. It is possible to rehabilitate the functions of some of the fadama
depressions, however, by improving water inflow channels and providing control structures
to retain water at desired levels. This would also help to rehabilitate fishing activity
affected by the dams (Annex 1).
Lift Irrigation by Direct Pumping
4.     For lift irrigation, the farmers place their pumps on the borders of rivers, lakes and
shallow-dug wells and irrigate small plots normally within 100 meters of the water source.
Small water channels may sometimes be necessary to maintain access to water when its

level subsides. In order to avoid major land levelling, small basins (of 1.0 m X 2.0 m or
less) are used to contain and manage the water. Water distribution is through crude
unlined field ditches or PVC pipes. Fields are irrigated only in daylight, once or twice a
week, and pumps are usually removed for safekeeping at night. Pumping units are
portable, weigh 20 kg to 30 kg, and consist of 2" or 3" self-priming centrifugal pumps
driven by 3 hp to 5 hp petrol engines. Maximum capacities are from 9 to 15 liters per
second at zero head to 7 and 12 liters per second at total dynamic heads halfway to their
maximum of 23 m and 26 m, respectively. Fuel consumption for a typical 5-6 hour day of
irrigation is 3-6 liters of gasoline. There has been a tendency in the past for minimal
maintenance of pumps and engines, and this accounts for their reportedly short life span
of three to five years. With proper handling and maintenance, this should be longer.
Such a culture is beginning to re-emerge in the society with the substantial devaluation of
the Naira bringing about a tenfold increase in capital costs in local currency terms.
Pumping from Shallow Aquifer
5.     Shallow Tubewells by Washboring. Washbore technology is simple and low-cost
(N750/well compared to N4,500/well for drilled tubewells), but its application is limited to
areas where aquifers are at depths of less than 7 m and overlain mainly by coarse or
moderately coarse textured materials. The mode of construction is to excavate more
resistant surficial materials, if present, with a soil auger or other hand tools and then to
pump water through a 50 to 75 mm rigid PVC pipe fitted with a nozzle inserted into the
excavation to jet out deeper granular material. Under favorable conditions, such as in the
dry river beds, this jetting process can start from the surface and is very rapid. The
extension of a well to a depth of seven or eight meters can be achieved in less than half
an hour. Once the requisite well depth has been achieved, jetting is continued long
enough to flush out all suspended particles. The jetting pipe is then withdrawn and a well
casing with screen is inserted in its place to the full depth of excavation. This casting
consists of rigid 50 to 75 mm diameter PVC pipe, in which the bottom 1.5 m has been
slotted with 0.5 mm slots and a plug inserted at the end. Coarse sand backfill is placed
around the casing to the top of the aquifer layer and finer materials above that. The
pump intake can then be coupled directly to the casing.
6.     Shallow Tubewells by Drilling. Rotary or percussion (bailer) rigs have to be used
wherever washboring is not feasible because of the depth of the aquifer or the resistance
of the overlying materials. The bailer is simple and inexpensive and can be made locally
and steel pipes are used as casing. It can drill up to 15 meters and provides good
stratigraphical information. The major disadvantage of this method is the slow rate of
penetration. Rotary rigs are used to establish wells to depths of 10 to 16 m through
relatively hard materials. PVC or galvanized steel casing 100 mm with a slotted screen is
inserted into the well during drilling. A 50 mm pump intake tubing is inserted into the
casing. A concrete collar is generally placed at the surface in order to secure the casing
and drain spillage away from the well head, thus minimizing the potential for



125                                Annex 4
contamination. The major disadvantage of rotary drilling systems is the cost of the
equipment ($40,000) and the need for sophisticated maintenance service.
7.    Among the three types of small-scale irrigation techniques described above, the lift
irrigation has the largest potential (1.03 million ha), shallow tubewells and/or washbores
have the second largest (0.87 million ha) and the controlled flooding has the smallest (0.17
million ha).

Land Tenure in Fadama Areas
1. Land Holdings
1.    The pattern of land allocation and inheritance has led to fragmentation of plots.
Nearly all respondents stated that they had several plots of upland and fadama land, most
of which they had inherited, but the plots were nearly all scattered in several areas. In
fact the variation in the number of plots operated by the farmers was very wide, as shown
in Figure A6. 1. The mean number of plots reported by the farmers interviewed was 7.8 in
Kano and 8.6 in Sokoto. Generally farmers had about one more upland plot than fadama
plot. That is, farmers had 4 - 5 upland plots and 3 - 4 fadama plots. This plot distribution
makes it difficult for an individual farmer to develop a large area with a technology which
requires permanent fixtures such as tubewells. One advantage of pumps and washbores is
that the bores are cheap to install and the pumps can be moved fairly readily from one
bore to another.
2. Tenancy Arrangements: The Haves and the Have-Nots of Fadama Land and Improved
Dry Season Farming Technology
2.    Kolawole (1991) reports that irrigation interventions, both on a large scale from
dams and on an individualized level with the use of tubewells and pumps, have altered the
land use pattern of the fadamas along the Hadejia Valley. He maintains that these
interventions have resulted in a number of conflicts not only between farmers and
pastoralists, but also between those farmers who can afford the technology and those who
cannot and farmers and fishermen, who claim that fish production levels are reducing in
the fadama areas.
3.    This study, on the other hand, found that generally, farmers who do not have
fadama land believe that the type of land and the presence or absence of water is beyond
their control ('from God'), so there should be no conflict between farmers who have land
with fadama potential for dry season farming and those without. However, in cases where
land had to be redistributed as a result of government acquisition or development
intervention, such as observed with a dam project in Danbatta area of Kano State,
resentment by farmers not given fadama land as compensation (while others received such
land) was built up against the recipients as well as against the officials. While inheritance
reflects one's lot in life, official intervention which appears to be unfair, is something else
and will be resisted.

4.     While land is becoming somewhat more scarce due to increased farming activities
and increasing population pressure on the land, there is still the opportunity to rent land
for agricultural production, particularly from farmers with large areas of land that they
cannot totally utilize. Even though farmers cultivated most of their upland and fadama
land during the wet season, less of the land, in terms of area per farmer, is utilized during
the dry season.
5.    An unusual case was found in Chiyeko village of Birnin Kudu District of Jigawa
State where the community leader said that most of the dry season farmers come from
outside the village to rent the fadama land at about N1,000/acre of fadama land for the
dry season only. Most of the indigenes, including himself, cultivated the upland and
fadama land during the wet season, but were content to benefit from the rent of the land
in the dry season. The village head did, however, concede that a few of the people from
the village are now getting interested in farming their own fadama land in the dry season,
having seen the benefits derived by their tenant farmers.
3. Increasing Value of Lond: Land Sales
6.     While value of both upland and fadama land was generally acknowledged to be
increasing, few respondents stated that they had sold any of their land.

Many respondents were actually surprised that we would suggest the possibility they could
dispose of any of their land which was their children's inheritance. This is consistent with
Davis (1993) who wrote:



Annex 6                                140
"Indigenous peoples do not view land as a 'commodity' which can be bought and
sold in impersonal markets ...... They view land as a substance with sacred
meanings, in social relations which define peoples' existence and identity" (Davis,
1993: 1).
7.    Most of the community leaders stated that very little land had changed hands. In
most cases, land transactions were with buyers from the same or a nearby community.
While they did not prevent outside buyers, but in nearly all cases, land sales were an
internal matter.



141                                 Annex 7
Socio-Cultural Characteristics of the Fulani People
1.    Casual outside observations of the Fulani tend to generalize about their life style,
wrongly assuming that they form a socially homogeneous group of people. In reality,
there are great social differences between those Fulani who have maintained the
traditional nomadic way of life and those who have fully settled. These differences are
recognized by the Fulani in Northern Nigeria, who divide themselves into three distinct
groups Swindell (1982):
a) Bororo'en or Boro'ien, exhibiting the extreme form of international
pastoralism;
b) Fulbe na'i, who combine cattle rearing with agriculture at a local level,
and who are semi-settled; and
c) Toroob (or Toronkawa), being completely settled urban residents.
2.     The Bororo'en, or bush Fulani, depend entirely upon cattle products for
consumption and sale. They are known to travel very long distances on their annual
migratory search for food and water. Oba and Lusigi (1987) refer to two types of
migration practiced by this category of Fulani:
a) "resource exploitation mobility" - practiced in response to unpredictable
pasture and water availability; and
b) "escape mobility" - long distance movements to escape drought
conditions, hostile populations and disease outbreak.
3.     The Bororo'en have few, if any, contacts with the local population, except with the
sale of their milk products by the women and occasionally sale of livestock. On their
migratory path, their cattle sometimes accidentally stray, and, at times, are intentionally
driven into farmers' fields, resulting in conflict.
4.     The Fulbe na'i have adopted mixed farming in response to changing conditions and
to ensure household security. Their farms are usually small and on poorer, less heavily
populated upland areas. The crop production pattern is largely restricted to growing early
millet which interferes least with herding activities. The semi-settled Fulani graze their
cattle over relatively shorter distances, an average of 117 kms., typically between the
fadama and uplands (Swindell, 1982).
5.     The Toroob  or completely settled, urban, subgroup of Fulani are basically non-
pastoralist and non-Fulfulde speaking, having almost totally abandoned their own language
in favor of Hausa language.



Annex 7                                  142
6.     One unique characteristic in the interaction between semi-settled Fulani and their
host communities is that there is often an informal leader for the Fulani (fully resident in
that locality), who may assist the Fulani by storing their possessions during their period of
migration. Interestingly, this leader may or may not be a Fulani man, but is someone in
whom the Fulani have confidence. When such a leader can be identified in a community,
he can serve as an effective link between the two groups, particularly when there are
conflicts. This arrangement has been observed in a number of villages in this and previous
field researches.
