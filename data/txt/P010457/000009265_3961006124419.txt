MEMORANDUM AND RECOMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT
OF THE INTERNATIONAL DEVELOPMENT ASSOCIATION
TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS
ON A PROPOSED CREDIT
TO INDIA
POR A FAMILY WELFARE (ASSAM, RAJASTHAN AND KARNATAKA) PROJECI
1.        The following memorandum and recommendation on a proposed credit to India is
submitted for approval. The credit, for SDR 62.7 million (US$88.6 million equivalent), would
be on standard IDA terms with 35 years maturity. The credit would help finance a Family
Welfare (Assam, Rajasthan and Karnataka) Project. The proceeds of the credit would be passed
on by the Government of India (GOI to the three States in accordance with standard
arrangements for development assistance to States.
2.        Sector Background: The Indian Family Welfare (FW) program  has had many
successes in loweng both fertlity and childhood mortality through provision of famiy planning
and maternal and child r.ealth (MCH) services. Its successful Universal Programme of
Immunisation has played an important role in the steep decline in infant mortality over recent
years. The program has also, as the major provider of family planning services, been largely
responsible for steep rises in contraceptive prevalence and declines in fertility over the last 15
years. Nationwide, India's infant mortality rate now stands at about 80, its total fertility rate at
about 4, and its contraceptive prevalence rate at around 45 percent of eligible couples.
3.        Yet the FW program still suffers from well-known problems. These include: rigid
targets and incentives; inadequate financing, partcularly for maintenance and drugs; inadequate
staff training, supervision and living conditions; inadequate outreach and community linkages;
limited Information, Education and Communication (EEC) efforts; and limited choice of
contraceptive methods. These problems are compounded in remote or backward areas by poor
management; difficult transport and access; cultural resistance to modern MCH care and family
planning; and lack of basic FW infrastructure.
4.        Government Actions: GOI is addressing these problems through the 1992 'Action
Plan for Revamping the Family Welfare Programme in Inrl-a". C.,anponents include: (1) national
consensus-building on FW issues (2) improvement ot service quality and outreach, including
upgrading of FW infrastructure and workers' living conditions and skills; (3) special initiatives
in India's 90 most backward districts; (4); modification of current systems of targets and
incentives; (5) a broadened contraceptive method mix with more use of spacing methods by
younger couples; (6) intensification of the UIP and MCH programs; (7) upgrading of FW
services in urban slums; (8) revitalisation of community-based link worker schemes; (9)
strengthening of FW fieldworker training; (10) intensification of IEC; (11) greater involvement
of NGOs; and (12) strengthening of intersectoral coordination.
5.        This Plan is being implemented with najor support from IDA-assisted operations.
The 1992 Child Survival and Safe Motherhood (CSSM) project strengthens the national MCH
program. The 1992 Soci Safety Net Credit improves FW drug supplies and services in the 90



2
districts. Improvements in FW service quality, urban services, taining, community-based
linkages, IEC, and NGO involvement are covered for the States and cities included in Area
Projects (see below). A new high-level Population Commission is worldng on policy
formulation, intersectoral coordination and national consensus-building. State Action Plans are
being prepared to implement the national Action Plan. Incentive and target systems are being
relaxed or dismantled. To promote a broader method mix, production of upgraded condoms,
IUDs and oral pills is being boosted, clinical trials of implants have begn, injectables have been
licensed for private-sector use, and improved vasectomy techniques are being introduced.
6.        The proposed project will support implementation in Assam, Rajashn and
Kamataka of Action Plan oomponents covering serice quality and outreach, fieldworker
training, communty linlkge programs, EEC and NGOs, besides strengthening referral care for
deliveries. It will also promote a broader method mix through appropriate project monitoring
indicators and pilot schemes to improve access to tenporary methods, such as creation of
networks of community depot-holders and distributors of contraceptive stocks.
7.        IDA Experience in the Sector: Beginning in 1973, IDA has supported nine prcjects
in population/primary health care in India. Eight have supported investment in FW program
strengthening, with similar scope and approach, in a range Jf states or cities ('Area Projects').
Assam and Rajasthan are almost the only states not yet covered under this series. In the projects
that have closed or are neaing completion (the First through the Fifth Population projects),
physical and programmatic objectives in civil works, service delivery, taining and I1C have
been largely fulfilled (see Schedule C for PCRs). Impact on mortality and fertlity was nuxed
in the first three projects (all limited to a few selected districts), but has been substantial in the
Fourth and Fifth projects. In the on-going projects (the Sixth and Seventh and CSSM), progress
is mixed, with better performance in the better administered and monitored staes and programs.
8.        Major problems encountered include: slow start-up; difficulties in integrating project
and program management; persistent delays in flows of funds to the projects; slow pace of
disbursements regardless of implementation progress; poor quality of civil works; and failures
to absorb and sustain project initiatives after closure. The basic approach of the projects appeas
sound if implemented well; the quality of project and program management and the long-term
commitment of the state or city to the project and to the FW program are key determinhats of
project success.
9.        IDA Lending Straty and Rationabl for Involvement: The Bank Group's Country
Stratgy (May 12, 1994) is to support GOI's efforts to provide an enablng envirmment for
broad-based, efficient, private sector-led growth, while accelerating human resource
development. A major element is enhancement of access to ano quality of basic social services
for the poor. Assistance to the FW program, which focuses on services for the poor, is centrl
to this strategy. It not only provides 4irect health benefits to poor mothers and young children
but also contnbutes to human capital development through fertiliy reduction, which cuts
population growth and dependency burdens, permitting greater investment in fewer children.

10.       The project would complete the Bank's long-tenn program of FW investment with
support to Rajasthan and Assam, plus follow-up in Karnataka on previous projects which did not
realise their ful potential. It is intended that sectorially and policy oriented operations will
follow, addressing major weaknesses in key aspects of the program, that will support the more
generalized implementation of the 1992 Action Plan. This project is a bridging operation, which
in itself will improve FW program performance in Assam, Rajasthan and Karnataka and
furthermore strengthen the program's structure for implementation of future policy changes.
11.      hroledi Qbleetives: The project has two intrrelated objectives. The first is to
strengthen and improve the functioning of the FW programs of Assam, Rajasdtan and Karnataka.
The second is to lower curent levels of fertility and maternal and childhood mortality in the
three states. Achievement of these objectives will be assessed through key project indicators
related to the aims and objectives of the Action Plan.
12.         jeet Decriplion: The project has five major components. Component (1) will
strenethen Famly Welfare service delivery through extension and upgrading of FW
inrstructure in underserved areas and strengthening of outreach and community linkages; it will
support: upgrding or rehabilitaton of facilities; establishment of ancillary mobile clinics;
transport for outreach and supervision; and community linkage and participation systems using
community volunteers. Component (2) will improve Family Welfare service quality through
support of: strengthening and rationalisation of taining institutions and programs; supplementary
equipment, drugs and other medical supplies; improvements in logistics systems for medical
supplies and transport; and involvement of NGOs and private medical practitioners (PMPs).
Component (3) will strengthen demand generation activities through support of: strengthiening
and atiolion of IEC institutions; IEC training for service providers and community
volunteers; JEC materials production; and selected IEC activities. Component (4) will strengthen
pu= ranam            d iem   entatim capacly through support to: development of state
Mnement Infornation Systems (MIS) and planning capabilities; development and monitoring
of strategies for populations with special needs; an office building for the Assam PW
department; and upgrading of staffing and equipment in the Ministry of Health and Family
Welfare (MOHFW)'s Area Projects Division. Component (5) will support two flexible funds for
(a) small pilot innovative schemes to imprwe service deliverya and (b) prlion of pgLrXsa
for Family Welfare investment in the heavily tribal and underdeveloped states of Arunachal
Pradesh, Manipur, Meghalaya, Mizoram, Nagaland and Tzipura in the Northeast.
13.       Social Aspects of Project Design: Poerty and Gender Aspct5: The main
beneficiaries of the FW program, which provides free MCH and family planning services, are
poor women and children. The project focuses on service delivery to the underrved and
isolated communites of each state, which are generally also the poorest.  Indig u
fPaulatioQn: The project covers states whose populations are 4-16 percent tribal, plus 2 percent
nomad in Rajasthan, and is in full compliance with Operatonal Directive 4.20. Beneficiary needs
assessments showed that health and fertlity-related disadvantages among these remote, isolated
and scattered groups were largely due to poor access to FW services, plus some special cultural
featus. he project will implement speci tribal/nomad service strategies, whose key elements



4
are mobile sevices, improved transport for providers, experimentation with smaller coverage
norms and relaxed facility construction and staffing standards, emphasis on community
participation, specially-tailored EEC strategies, heavy NGO involvement, and special monitoring.
14.       Project pIlementatlon: The project will be implemented by the states, with
supervision by the Area Projects Division of MOHFW. Each state will set up a high-level
empowered committee to make major policy decisions, authorise transfers of project funds from
the centre to the project, and monitor overall project progress. A project management unit will
implement the project under its guidance, staffed for extensive field monitoring of civil works.
After project closure, unit facilities, equipment and staff will be merged into regular program
management. Project-program coordination will be built into management routines.
15.       froject CoQ: The total cost of the seven-year project, including duties and taxes,
is esfimated at Rs. 4,409.8 million (US$103.8 million equivalentj. IDA would finance US$ 88.6
million equivalent, covering 89.9 percent of costs net of taxes. The cost net of taxes is Rs.
4182.7 million (IJ$98.5 million equivalent). A breakdown of project costs and the financing
plan are shown in Schedule A. Retroactive financing of up to US$1.0 million will be provided
to cover eligible expenditures incurred after December, 1993 to facilitate ongoing start-up
activities. Schedule B shows the amounts and methods of procurement and the disbursement
schedule. A timetable of key project processing events and the status of Bank Group operations
in India are presented in Schedules C and D. The Staff Appraisal Report, Report No. 12771-N,
dated May 24, 1994 is being distributed separately.
16.        Project %Mhftainabity: The FW program is financed almost entirely by GOI, but
a few important expnses are borne by the states. In the three project states, about 94 percent
of FW expenditure is currently met by GOI and the remaining 6 percent by the states. Additional
annual recurrent costs generated by the project after closure are estimated at a total Rs. 155
million. Given an unchanged funding split, GOI's share would amount to Rs. 146 million, the
equivalent of only 1.2 percent of GOI's total FW budget this fiscal year and clearly sustainable.
The states' share would amount to Rs. 9 million, which is equivalent to increases of 9-12 percent
in each state's non-GOI financed FW budget for this fiscal year, but a very small share of
overall state expenditure. In addition, it should be noted that these investments are being carried
out as the Government of India is implementing a reform program, aw important aim of which
is to reduce the role of government in some sectors but to strengthen public financing of high
priority human resources investments.
17.       A0 rtache: At negotiations, GOI provided an assurance that it would:
(a) carry out with IDA an annual review of resource requirements for the project for next fiscal
year, to detennine that there will be full provision for project activities; and 0) implement the
Action Plan for Revamping the Family Welfare Program. The states provided assurances that
they would: (a) establish the full project management structure by October 30, 1994; (b) engage
all other key additional personnel by December 31, 1994; (c) ensure that adequate and timely.
resources for the maintenance of FW facilities are provided and that facilities are adequately
maintained; (d) ensure adequate supplies of drugs and other medical materials to FW facilities;



5
(e) implement the State Action Plans; (f) utilise agreed key project indicators related to national
and state Action Plan objectives for project monitoring and evaluation; (g) implement their tribal
strategies fully. The state of Kanataka also provided an assurance that it would: (a) carry out
a program of adequate rehabilitation of existing FW facilities; and (b) firnish satisfactory
evidence of the program's satisfactory implementation.
18.   -    roject Beneftgs: The project would improve FW  service quality in Assam,
Rajasthan and Karnataka, increase access to FW services in poor and underserved areas, increase
demand for FW sres, and strengthen program management. Improved program effectiveness
is expected to increase service utilisation, and hence achieve better health for r.others and
children and accelerated, mutually reinforcing, declines in fertility and maternal and childhood
mortality. Eventually, fertility would fall low enough to bring about a decline in population
growth in the three states and nationwide. State goals for the year 2000 are a birth rate of 20
or 21 per 1,000 population, a contraeptive prevalence rate of 60 percent of all eligible couples
and an infant mortality rate of 50 per 1,000 live births.
19.       ProjetB Risks: The project carries several risks, most of which are endemic in FW-
support projects, but can be reduced if not eliminated through careful project design: (a) Based
on past project experience, the risk of poor implementation is significant in all thee states. To
minimize this risk, tight specifications and control measures have been built into the project for
past problem areas, such as design, management, supervision and maintenance of civil works
and mechanisms for strengtheniag and coordination of program and project management. (b)
Likewise, the risk that project-created infrastructure and programs will not be maintained is
everywhere substantial. This risk has been mimized through project agreements on building
and drug budget maintenance during the project period and by building in project-program
coordination and management strengthening measures. (c) A third risk is that many of the
proposed approaches and programs are new and untested, particularly regarding outreach and
community linkage schemes and mobile services. To minimize this risk, the project design calls
for pilots, evaluations and gradual phasing-in of new programs. (d) Assam also faces the risk
of an unpredictable secririty situation. Control of this risk is beyond the scope of the project, but
security problems have not interfered with project preparation and, in the judgement of COI and
the state, are unlikely significantly to jeopardise FW investment.
20.       Reeommendation: I am satisfied that the proposed credit will comply with the
Articles of Agreement of the Association and recommend that the Executive Directors approve
the proposed credit.
