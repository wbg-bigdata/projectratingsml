A: PROJECT DEVELOPMENT OBJECTIVE
1. Project development objective and key performance indicators (see
Annex 1):
The objective of this project is the development of a common policy framework, based on
Internationally recognized best practices, for Rural and Micro-finance in Tanzania which
will establish an enabling environment for rural and micro-finance and increase the quality
and returns of the many follow-on investments planned by Government agencies and other
donors. The project will also seek to increase the level of knowledge and skills within the
industry and institute a program of systematic tracking and analyzing all initiatives against
commnon criteria. The lessons derived from that analysis will be fed back to the industry
and other stakeholders. The effectiveness of this initiative will be measured by monitoring
Government and donor compliance with the policy framework and the quality and quantity
of new investments into the sector.
B: STRATEGIC CONTEXT
1. Sector-related Country Assistance Strategy (CAS) goal supported by the
project (see Annex 1):
CAS document number: 16554-TA   Date of latest CAS discussion: May 6, 1997
The goal of this project is to contribute to the development of a diversified and sustainable
Rural and Micro-finance system with wide outreach thereby contributing to broad-based
growth and poverty reduction through expansion of financial intermediation to small-scale
rural and urban clients. Sustainability will be measured inter alia by the overall
profitability of those institutions operating in the sector and the traditional "CAMEL"
banking indicators. Outreach will be measured by the number of customers served, the
value of their business and the number of institutions or service outlets established
throughout the country.
2. Main sector issues and Government strategy:
Over the last five years, Tanzania has successfully liberalized its financial sector.
Numerous new private financial institutions have been established including entry by
several well-known and highly regarded international banks including Citibank, Standard
Chartered and Stanbic. These banks have focused their attention on the high-value end of
the market concentrated primarily in Dar es Salaam. Gradually they are spreading their
operations into other, economically significant parts of the country. However, the vast
majority of Tanzanians remain untouched by the entry of these new banks.
At the same time, the Government has been involved in a tough program of parastatal bank
restructuring and privatization. As these banks have been forced to concentrate on the
financial viability of their operations and to recognize the losses of previous lending
activities, branches have been closed and business activities have been rationalized. While
the longer term objective of these measures is to improve access, the immediate impact has



Page 3
been an overall reduction in the availability of financial services to ordinary Tanzanians
provided by these banks.
The reform of the agriculture sector has resulted in the dismantling of single chain
agricultural marketing institutions, i.e. the cooperatives, which previously provided credit
for agricultural inputs with repayment to be made through deduction from payments made
for crops later sold through the cooperatives. While small-scale cooperative savings and
credit cooperatives have emerged in a few parts of the country to fill this gap, their
coverage is limited and they remain weak and vulnerable to both fraud and mis-
management.
Various government agencies responded in different ways, but usually by advocating the
use of directed lines of credit targeted at different groups identified according to the special
interests and agendas of the particular agencies involved. At the same time the Bank of
Tanzania, following a review of its experience with such schemes, had rejected this kind of
approach and, after some initial experimentation with the concept of community banks,
shifted its focus to the immediate task of restructuring the troubled parastatal banks.
Donors, too, were intervening in a variety of ways, through multiple entry points both
within Government and elsewhere, e.g. the NGO community. The donor involvement was
uncoordinated, not based on internationally recognized best practices, and reflected each
individual donor's particular priorities. As such, donor initiatives often contributed little to
sustainable development of micro-level financial services and undermined the efforts of
others.
3. Sector issues to be addressed by the project and strategic choices:
This project intends to address the lack of access to appropriate financial services by
ordinary Tanzanians by creating an enabling environment for the development of a broad-
based, sustainable rural and micro-finance system. It will seek to do this by developing a
common policy framework which will provide both a structure for the development
activities of Government agencies and donors active in the sector, and by providing a way
to learn from those experiences through the dissemination the results of extensive
monitoring and evaluation to the private sector institutions, Government agencies and
donors.
The Government has recognized that there is great interest on the part of donors, NGOs
and others to invest in the development of a sustainable (i.e. profitable) rural and micro-
finance sector. As part of this objective, the Government has recognized the need to
develop a common framework approach that will guide investment into the sector in a
consistent and complementary manner under a common set of principles and a unified
system of regulation and supervision.
The Government agency given responsibility for this process, the Bank of Tanzania, has
from the very outset adopted a thoroughly participatory approach which has included the
use of customer and industry surveys, participatory workshops, study tours, and a joint
review of the sector by the various Government agencies concerned working together with
almost all the donors active in rural and micro-finance in Tanzania.

C: PROJECT DESCRIPTION SUMMARY
1. Project Components (see Annex 2 for a detailed description and Annex 3
for a detailed cost breakdown):
The project will have the following components:--
1.    Development and approval of a National Micro-finance Policy. Following
exposure to international examples of successful MFIs and training in
micro-finance, a Tanzanian Task force has prepared a draft national
policy for Rural and Micro-finance. The draft was reviewed by an
international expert and was presented for further review to a workshop of
Tanzanian stakeholders. A revised draft will soon be presented to Cabinet
for approval.
2.    Design of an appropriate legal, regulatory and supervisory framework for
micro-finance. A Tanzanian Task Force representing stakeholders will
oversee a review by international experts of the legal, regulatory and
supervisory framework as it pertains to Rural and Micro-finance. The
consultants will develop recommendations for revisions in the law and
regulations and will make detailed proposals for strengthening supervisory
arrangements. These recommendations will be reviewed by a wider group
of stakeholders before being finalized.
3.    Preparation of operational standards/guidelines for Government and
Donor support to rural and micro-finance. A team of consultants will be
recruited to draft four sets of operational guidelines/standards covering (i)
banks, (ii) cooperative financial institutions, (iii) NGOs, and (iv) capacity
building initiatives. The guidelines will be used to ensure that each
Government and donor initiative maintains certain quality standards, uses
a consistent set of performance indicators and focuses on the
sustainability of the interventions.
4.     Capacity building to enable the Bank of Tanzania to coordinate, monitor,
and evaluate development activities in the Micro-finance sector. The
Bank of Tanzania will coordinate Government and donor initiatives and
will systematically track and analyze progress under each rural and micro-
finance initiative using a common set of performance indicators feeding
the lessons from this analysis back to the industry and other stakeholders
through workshops and conferences so that positive experiences can be
replicated and scaled up as appropriate
5 .    Micro-finance Industry Knowledge and Skills Building This will consist
of two main activities. The first is a series of bi-annual technical
workshops to disseminate research work and technical handbooks
prepared by CGAP on such topics as MIS, Business Planning, etc.. The
second is a series of annual conferences bringing together all stakeholders

in the industry which will be a forum for exposing participants to
international developments and experiences within the country.

2. Key policy and institutional reforms supported by the project:
The primary policy and institutional reforms are threefold. First, the project has supported
the development of a national policy on rural and microfinance through a Project
Preparation Facility (PPF), endorsing principles of international best practice, which will
direct future Government activity in the sector and will diffuse unwelcome and
inappropriate political interference. Secondly, the project will assist in the strengthening of
the regulatory and supervisory environment for rural and micro finance. Finally, the
project will support capacity building to enable the Bank of Tanzania to implement the
activities supported by the project, coordinate other donor activities and rigorously monitor
and evaluate different initiatives as they are implemented. Some modest capacity building
support will also be provided to the Cooperative Department.
3. Benefits and target population:
This project will facilitate increased, higher quality and complementary investments into
the rural and micro-finance sector by enhancing donor and intra-Government coordination
and by ensuring that funds flowing into the sector are invested in accordance with
internationally accepted best practices in micro finance and in ways that complement other
initiatives. By so doing it will increase the level of donor and private resources invested in
the sector and enhance the returns on those investments.
The primary beneficiaries will be the Microfinance Institutions who will gain from
strengthened business planning capacity, enhanced training and other learning



Page 6
opportunities, other capacity building measures, an improved emphasis on sustainability,
and a more consistent and business-oriented relationship with both the Government and the
donor community. The ultimate beneficiaries will be the customers of the emerging rural
and microfinance institutions who will enjoy improved access to a variety of financial
services specially targeted at small-scale savers and borrowers throughout the country.
4. Institutional and implementation arrangements:
Primary responsibility for development of rural and micro-finance policy was given to the
Bank of Tanzania. The Bank of Tanzania implemented a series of nationwide studies on
Rural and Micro finance and managed a series of study tours and workshops, supported by
a PHRD grant, aimed at exposing key policy makers and practitioners to international best
practices in Microfinance. It is recognized that other stakeholders need to be completely
integrated into the policy process as it moves forward. For this reason, the Bank of
Tanzania has commissioned an institutional study to recommend an appropriate
institutional set-up that will both provide the necessary resources for project
implementation and will ensure broad-based participation by all stakeholders.
D: PROJECT RATIONALE
1. Project alternatives considered and reasons for rejection:
The historical approach to rural and micro finance by IDA in Tanzania has been to
support directed line of credit projects to certain target sections of the overall population.
This approach has been rejected by the Tanzanian authorities owing its very poor track
record of sustainability and development impact. Instead, it has been replaced with an
approach that emphasizes the development of a variety of sustainable (i.e. profitable) rural
and micro-finance intermediaries providing a range of financial services to small scale
client including savings, credit, transfer payments, and others.
Within that approach IDA could have chosen to support the development of particular
institutions rather than support the development of an enabling environment by itself. In
fact, IDA is already providing support to one financial intermediary, the National
Microfinance Bank, as part of its overall program of support for the restructuring and
privatization of National Bank of Commerce under the Financial Institutions Development
Project. Beyond this single instance, and in the context of very strong donor interest in
supporting the development of micro finance intermediaries, it is felt that IDA can add
most value by facilitating the establishment of the framework while other donors can
engage more effectively with individual financial institutions, including NGOs, once that
framework is in place. A large number of donors have been collaborating in the process of
developing the framework to date and have indicated their intentions to make substantial
investments in the development of the sector.

3. Lessons learned and reflected in the project design:
There are three main lessons which have been learnt as a result of previous experience in
Tanzania. First, the previous approach using directed lines of credit was ineffective,
costly, unsustainable and of limited impact due to poor outreach. The new approach
emphasizes sustainability, distinguishes clearly between effective and ineffective
institutions, and maximizes outreach on a sustainable basis by leveraging deposits as the
source of funds for lending.
Secondly, uncoordinated initiatives, whether donor-led or Government-led, tend to
undermine each other where there is no common adherence to a mutually agreed set of
principles. The approach under this project encourages all stakeholders to participate in
the development of a common framework made up of an agreed set of principles and based
on internationally recognized best practice as a way to maximize the impact of all
Government and donor investment in the sector.
Thirdly, experience from the joint Government/donor review mission in September 1997 in
which 13 different donors participated, indicates that there is strong and broad-based
donor interest in supporting the development of sustainable rural and micro finance
services. This project has been designed to facilitate and leverage donor investment in the
sector rather than displace it, by using a modest level of IDA funds strategically to finance
a few key activities which will then enhance the economic and social impact of the much
larger collective contributions provided by other parties.
4. Indications of borrower commitment and ownership:
Since 1994 the Bank of Tanzania has been responsible for leading the process of analysis,
policy development and project preparation. Work took on a new level of seriousness in
December 1995 when President Mkapa called on the Bank of Tanzania to find ways to



Page 8
make financial services more widely available to ordinary Tanzanians throughout the
country,
At its own expense, the Bank of Tanzania organized a national conference in April 1997
on microfinance for all financial institutions present in the country. It brought in some of
the world's leading experts to make presentations both to the conference and also to
selected Parliamentarians and Members of the Cabinet.
The Bank of Tanzania requested and managed a $500,000 PHRD grant to further its
research into rural and micro finance policy which, in turn, became the basis for a joint
Govermnent of Tanzania/multi-donor review of the sector. The Bank of Tanzania took the
lead in organizing the comprehensive Government participation in that mission which
involvecd 9 different Tanzanian agencies and departmnents and 13 different donors. Most
recently, the Bank of Tanzania organized a retreat for Govermment officials to prepare a
Logical Framework Analysis for this project. This Project Proposal is a reflection of their
discussions during the retreat. They are now firmly committed to full and timely
implementation of the project described here.
When Mr. Wolfensohn met with President Mkapa in Kanpala in January 1998, President
Mkapa asked for the Banks' support in the development of microfinance services. Mr.
Wolfensohn indicated that we were indeed ready to help on the basis that any support
would be provided in the context of already established microfinance best practice.
5. Value added of Bank support in this project:
First, it will institutionalize best practice approaches to the development of microfinance in
Tanzania, Secondly, it will help to further consolidate Tanzanian ownership of the
microfinance program and, thirdly, it will facilitate the inflow of substantial donor
resources in a way that will be consistent with international best practices in microfinance.
E: SUMMARY PROJECT ANALYSIS
(detailed assessments are in the Project File (See Annex 7)
1. Economic (supported by Annex 4):
This project will facilitate increased, higher quality and complementary investments into
the rural and micro-finance sector by enhancing donor and intra-Govenmuent coordination
and by ensuring that funds flowing into the sector are invested in accordance with
internationally accepted best practices in micro finance and in ways that complement other
initiatives. By so doing it will increase the level of donor and private resources invested in
the sector and enhance the returns on those investments.
Microfinance Institutions who will gain from strengthened business planning capacity,
enhanced training and other learning opportunities, other capacity building measures, an
improved emphasis on sustainability, and a more consistent and business-oriented
relationship with both the Government and the donor community. The ultimate



Page 9
beneficiaries will be the customers of the emerging rural and microfinance institutions who
will enjoy improved access to a variety of financial services specially targeted at small-
scale savers and borrowers throughout the country.
Against this, project costs are modest and it is expected that the anticipated benefits far
outweigh the costs involved.
2. Financial Assessment:
The project implementing agencies will maintain financial management systems, including
accounting, financial reporting, and auditing systems- adequate to ensure that they can
provide accurate and timely information regarding project resources and expenditures.
The Financial Management Specialist based in the Resident Mission, as part of her
contribution to the preparation work, is working with the Bank of Tanzania to ensure
compliance with the Bank's financial management requirements as per OP/BP 10.02.
3. Technical:
On the Tanzanian side, the technical quality of the project has been enhanced through the
use of a rigorously participatory approach which has solicited stakeholder input at each
stage of project preparation. The Tanzanian team has exerted strong ownership of the
process and this has been complemented by the exposure of key Tanzanians to
international best practices and quality training in micro-finance (Economnics Institute at
Colorado, Harvard). This has been supplemented by inputs from leading international
specialists in micro-finance including Robert Christen, Elizabeth Rhyne, Margeurite
Robinson, Pancho Otero and others.
On the Bank side, the team is working in close partnership with CGAP, represented by
Brigit Helms, to ensure that the project reflects internationally recognized best practice in
micro-finance. Carlos Cuevas, Senior Rural Finance Specialist, has been appointed as
Technical Anchor to the Task Team. He is responsible for ensuring that the project is
thoroughly reviewed within the AFTP 1 and Financial Network families and that all
technical aspects are addressed appropriately. The team also includes a Procurement
Specialist (V. S. Krishnakumar) and a Financial Management Specialist (Mercy Sabai).
4. Institutional:
a. Executing agencies: The Executing Agency will be the Bank of Tanzania
b. Project management: The Directorate of Micro-finance of the Bank of Tanzania will be
responsible for managing the project. In addition, it will seek representatives of other
stakeholders to serve on the two task forces planned under the project.
5. Social:
A thorough social analysis was made of equity, gender and participation aspects of this
project during the identification mission. The two main issues concern donor perceptions



Page 10
of the social achievements that can be realized through the development of rural and
microfinancial services. The impact on gender will be modest but microfinance is able to
help poor people who have access to economic opportunities.
6. Environmental Assessment:
Environmental Category   [ ] A   [ ] B   [ X I C
In view of the very limited size of the project and its capacity building nature, with no
inftastructure and little equipment financed, the activities financed are not expected to have
any significant negative environmental impact.



Page 11
7. Participatory Approach:
a. Primary beneficiaries and other affected groups:
All the primary beneficiaries have been involved in the process so far. These have
included the banks (NBC, NMB, CRDB, TPB, etc.) the cooperative financial institutions
(Kilimanjaro Cooperative Bank, Savings and Credit Union league of Tanzania, SACCOs),
financial NGOs (PRIDE, MEDA, Presidential Trust Fund, Gatsby Trust, etc.),
educational institutions (ESAMI, REDI, IFM, University of Dar es Salaam, Cooperative
College), Government agencies (Bank of Tanzania, Ministry of Finance, Ministry of
Agriculture and Cooperatives - Cooperative Department, State House, Vice President's
Office, Prime Minister's Office, Ministry of Commnunity Development, Women's Affairs
and Children, etc.), and others. They have participated in surveys of their respective
institutions, the dissemination workshop, international study tours, interacted or
participated in the joint Government/donor review mission, and participated in a review of
the Logical Framework Analysis. At each point stakeholder views have been solicited and
incorporated into the policy and preparation process. Plans for project preparation and
project implementation both include provisions for ongoing consultation and participation
throughout the process.
b. Other key stakeholders:
In addition to the organizations mentioned above, a consortium of local NGOs specializing
in gender issues carried out an independent review in FY96 of World Bank-financed
activities in Tanzania. In this review they focused their attention on our workprogram for
rural and microfinance and made a number of recommendations in this regard. In follow-
up to these recommendations, a special team was included in the joint Government/donor
review mission with the specific task of exploring equity, gender and participation issues
as they related to rural and microfinance.
F: SUSTAINABILITY AND RISKS
1. Sustainability:
Sustainability has been addressed throughout the project preparation process (1) by
encouraging broad Tanzanian participation and commitment during the development of the
project concept and, (2) by making sustainability a key measure of overall project
effectiveness and development impact.
Within the project itself, the policy framework will ensure that future support from donors
will only be directed to Microfinance Institutions and Microfinance Institution Service
Providers on the basis of both a business plan and performance indicators chosen to
measure progress towards sustainability. In addition, resources will be provided to
strengthen capacity for monitoring and evaluation of different initiatives in Microfinance
and to feed the results of these evaluations back to the industry through regular
conferences and workshops, thus encouraging practitioners to build on successful
experiences and to discard unsuccessful approaches. Finally, the incentive framework



Page 12
built into the project will
be designed in such a way as to reward achievement of sustainability goals and to
reallocate resources away from activities which fail to move towards these goals.

3. Possible Controversial Aspects:
There is a possible conflict of interest between BOT's role as both regulator of the sector
and coordinator of activities under this project. However, BOT's track record of
managing the FIDP project, where a similar potential conflict exists, has minimized any
cause for concern.

Rural and Micro-financial Services Project
Project Description
Project Component 1 - US$0.10 million (total cost of component)
Development andApproval of a National Micro-finance Policy. With support
from a PPF and following exposure to international examples of successful MFIs
and training in micro-finance, a Tanzanian Task force has prepared a draft
national policy for Rural and Micro-finance. To enhance the quality of the policy,
an internationally acknowledged expert was commissioned to review the draft and
propose changes to bring it into line with internationally established best practice.
It was then presented for further review to a workshop of Tanzanian stakeholders,
(including banks, cooperatives, NGOs Governnent agencies, private sector
organizations, etc.). A revised draft will soon be presented to Cabinet for
approval.
The other donors interested in rural and micro-finance have been collaborating
closely in the policy review and formulation process to date. They have indicated
their intentions to make substantial investments into the sector within the
framework of the new policy.
Project Component 2 - US$0.30 million (total cost of component)
Design of an Appropriate Legal, Regulatory and Supervisory Framework for
Micro-finance. A Tanzanian Task Force representing stakeholders will oversee a
review by international experts of the legal, regulatory and supervisory framework
as it pertains to Rural and Micro-finance. The consultants will develop
recommendations for revisions in the law and regulations and will make detailed
proposals for strengthening supervisory arrangements. These recommendations
will be reviewed by wider group of stakeholders before being finalized. A number
of other donors have indicted their intentions to provide support for
implementation of these recommendations.
Project Component 3 - US$0.07 million (total cost of component)
Provision of Operational Standards/Guidelines for Government and Donor
Support to Rural and Micro-finance. A team of consultants will be recruited to
draft four sets of operational guidelines/standards covering (i) banks, (ii)
cooperative financial institutions, (iii) NGOs, and (iv) capacity building initiatives.
The guidelines will be used to ensure that each Government and donor initiative
maintains certain quality standards, uses a consistent set of performance indicators
and focuses on the sustainability of the interventions. Before being finalized, the
prposed guidelines will be subject to a review by stakeholders.
Project Component 4 - US$1.53 million (total cost of component)

This project will facilitate increased, higher quality and complementary investments into
the rural and micro-finance sector by enhancing donor and intra-Government coordination
and by ensuring that funds flowing into the sector are invested in accordance with
intemationally accepted best practices in micro finance and in ways that complement other
initiatives. By so doing it will increase the level of donor and private resources invested in
the sector and enhance the returns on those investments.
Microfinance Institutions who will gain from strengthened business planning capacity,
enhanced training and other leaming opportunities, other capacity building measures, an
improved emphasis on sustainability, and a more consistent and business-oriented
relationship with both the Government and the donor community. The ultimate
beneficiaries will be the customers of the emerging rural and microfinance institutions who
will enjoy improved access to a variety of financial services specially targeted at small-
scale savers and borrowers throughout the country.
Against this, project costs are modest and it is expected that the anticipated benefits far
outweigh the costs involved.

Rural and Micro-financial Services Project
Procurement and Disbursement Arrangements
Procurement
Procurement methods (Table A)
Consultant Services:   The World Bank-financed consultants will be
contracted in accordance with World Bank guidelines: Selection and Employment
of Consultants by World Bank Borrowers (Consultant Guidelines), published in
January 1997 and revised in September 1997.
Prior review thresholds (Table B)
All contracts for purchase of goods above the threshold value of
US$20,000 will be subject to IDA's prior review procedures.
For consultant services, all Terms of Reference (TORs) irrespective of
value, will be subject to IDA's prior reviews. Prior review will be required for
contracts for services of consulting firms costing US$50,000 and over and for
services of individual consultants costing US$25,000 and over and will include the
review of budgets, short-lists, selection procedures, request for proposals,
evaluation reports and draft contracts. All documents related to procurement not
under "prior review" will be maintained by the Borrower for ex-post review by
auditors and by IDA supervisions missions.
Disbursement
Allocation of loan proceeds (Table C) Table C shows the allocation of
the proceeds of the credit. The proceeds of the IDA credit of US$2.0 million
would be disbursed over a three year period, and a period of four months after the
closing date would be allowed to make payments for expenditures actually
incurred prior to and including the closing date. The annual estimated
disbursements are given in a table on page one of the Project Appraisal Document
(PAD).
Use of statements of expenses (SOEs): Disbursements for all
expenditures would be against full documentation, except for items of
expenditures under contracts and purchase orders for (a) good contracts costing
less than US$20,000; (b) contracts for services of consulting firms costing less
than US$50,000 and for services of individual consultants costing less than
US$25,000, (c) all local training; (d) all incremental operating costs, and (e)
workshop expenditures costing less than US$5,000 which would be based on
statements of expenditure (SOEs). Supporting documents for SOEs should be



Page 22
retained by the borrower for IDA review.
Special Account:     To facilitate disbursements, a Special Account in
US dollars would be established and operated at the Bank of Tanzania, under
terms and conditions satisfactory to IDA. Upon project effectiveness, a sum of
US$200,000 would be deposited by IDA into this account. Further deposits by
IDA into this account would be made against withdrawal applications supported
by appropriate documentation.
Accounting and Audit: The Bank of Tanzania Directorate of
Microfinance will maintain accounting records for the project components that
they manage directly. The existing accounting and financial management system,
reviewed by the Bank Financial management Specialist, will be used and improved
during the first year of the project to prepare for LACI. In addition to their
financial statements, the Bank of Tanzania Directorate of Microfinance agreed to
submit a quarterly report, one month after the end of each quarter, presenting a
summary of sources and uses of funds, procurementlcontracts schedule and
statement and summary of expenditures by component and by category. The
project accounts, SOEs and the Special Accounts would be audited each year by
independent auditors acceptable to IDA. All documentation should be retained by
the Focal Point implementing the project activities. The auditors' reports and
certificates in respect of each of these three statements of accounts would be
furnished to IDA within six months of the close of each financial year.

be customized to the BOT both internal requirements and external needs. It will also be
able meet new products in the modem banking system. The new computerized system is
expected to be in operation by July 1999. The new computerized accounting system to be
implemented will be a user friendly with ability to import and export data from other
software and capable to customize various reports. This will include the Project
Management Reports (PMRs) for LACI disbursement requirement.
BOT Audit Report
The audit of BOT under its Acts is to be carried out by the independent qualified audit
firm and Board of Directors has a mandate to appoint any independent qualified audit firm
on a competitive basis. Currently there are four audit firms which have qualified to audit
BOT accounts. These are PriceWaterhouse Coopers, Tanzania Audit Corporation,
KPMG Peatmarwick and Massawe Ernst & Young. The accounts are supposed to be
submitted to the auditor within three months after the end of the BOT financial year. The
audit report for financial year ending June 1998 was issued in August 1998 one month
before the due date. The report was unqualified and there were no issues raised in the
management audit report.

basis for monitoring and disbursements were shared with BOT officials coordinating the
project and the management information technology team who are developing the Project

the Project Implementation Manual and are satisfactory for providing reasonable
assurances that accounts are properly recorded and resources safeguarded.
The Chart of Accounts for the project is based on the National Chart of Account and in
conformity with the International Accounting Standard satisfactory to the Bank (IDA).

accounting principles acceptable to IDA. The Financial Statement will include at least a
statement of sources and uses of funds, a statement of reconciliation of the special
accounts and a balance sheet.

of the fiscal year.
3.    Auditing

to IDA. The selection of the auditor is a condition of effectiveness.
The auditor will provide an opinion on:
a)    Adequacy of Accounting and Internal Control System
b)    Financial Management System

Page 31
accountant will be assigned to maintain detailed accounting records for the project.
5.    Project Management Reports
The Bank is introducing an initiative to change loan administration in Bank Group
projects, the Loan Administration Change Initiative (LACI). This initiative assists projects
to put in place sound Financial Management, Procurement and output Monitoring
Systems. Where appropriate, if these systems are in place, disbursements may be made on
the basis of agreed quarterly Project Management Reports (PMR) rather than on the basis
of individual invoices or statements of expenditures.
An assessment has been made that the Directorate of Microfinance will gradually apply
LACI. PMR procedures will be implemented progressively during the first year of project
implementation. There is the need to ensure that the systems put in place are operating
smoothly. The monitoring and evaluation process will include output monitoring reports
which are consistent with the PMR requirements.
The financial, procurement and output monitoring systems will be reviewed as part of the
mid-term review at the end of the first year to assess whether it will be appropriate to
move to Full PMR based disbursement at that time.
