1.        I submit the following report and recommendation on a proposed
loan to the Republic of Bolivia for US$9.5 million to help finance the
In.avi :bural Development Project. The loan would be made on Standard
Third Window terms of 25 years, including seven years of grace, with
interest at 4-1/2%.
PAR' I - THE E3ONOff
Introduction
2.        An economiz report entitled "C3urrent Economiz Position and
Prospects of Bolivia" (786a-BO) dated July 28, 1975, was distributed to
the Executive Directors. Country data sheets are attached as Annex I.
Back,round
3.        Despite the increasing importance of petroleum and natural gas
exports, as well as significant mineral deposits, Bolivia remains one of
the poorest countries in South America. The majority of the population is
engaged in traditional agriculture. Only a small part of the labor force
is employed in the modern sectors. rhe infrastructure is primitive and the
road and rail networks cover only a fraction of the country. The combination
of strong traditional ties within the Indian communities and geographic,
health and educational obstacles to population mobility has perpetuated the
demographic concentration on the barren, windswept and dry 10-15 thousand
feet plateau, the Altiplano. About half of Bolivia's population lives a
physically, culturally and economically isolated subsistence existence in
this inhospitabla region which is rich in mineral deposits but limited in
agricultural potential.
4;.       The 1952 revolution sought to put an end to the dual structure
which had characterized Bolivia's economy since colonial times and to
depri-ve the landowning and mining oligarchy of its economic base. This
objective was only partially achieved. Progress was made in eradicating
feudal relations, distributing the land and eliminati-ng obstacles to social
mobility. The agrarian reform and the nationalization of large mines,
however, were followed by falling production. JDP declined in the 1950s
and did not recover to its pre-1952 level until 1961. During the sub-
sequent decade, output increased steadily at an average annual rate of
around 5%, providing for average annual per capita income increases of
2.5%. As a result, GNP per capita which had fallen by 24% in the 1952-60
period had recovered by 1970, to the 1952 level and was more equally
distributed.  However, the momentum of economi-. growth was again lost in

1970/71 because of political instability associated with declining private
investment and deteriorating public finances. The deterioration of public
finances reflected a structural flaw in the economy. Bolivia's public sector
is proportionately one of the largest in South America and a source of
livelihood for a sizeable segment of the population. With the scarcity of
employment opportunities in the private sector, pressures to expand the
ranks of public servants proved difficult to resist. Increased expenditures
on wages and salaries, combined with a weak tax system, left few resources
for investment. Moreover, the inability of the public sector to generate
adequate savin-s limited its capacity to utilize external assistance.
5.        On coming to power in 1971, Presiden-t Banzer faced the need to
provide jobs for the unemployed and to revitalize investment and output growth.
This need was initially faced in the context of a sharp deterioration in
Bolivia's terms of trade whizh produced a weakening in the balance-of-payments
and a further deterioration in public finances and eventually resulted in
a substantial devaluation in 1972. At the same time, however, more rational
economic policies were put into effect. To establish a more favorable
climate for private investment, new laws offering guarantees and incentives
to private investors were promulgated and claims arising from earlier
nationalizations were settled.  The Government also improved public
admLnistration and the pricing policies of some public undertakings. These
policies were successful in increasing private investment and in bolstering
bhe rate of growth.
Recent Economic Developments and Prospects
6.        The most important events affecting recent economic performance have
been the substantial improvement in the terms of trade in 1974 and the sub-
sequent deterioration last year. The sharp increases in petroleum
and mineral prices in 1974 allowed a simultaneous and large expansion of both
consumption and investment and brought about an unprecedented improvement in
public finances and the balance of payments. After current deficits in
1970-73 the Oentral Government achieved savings equivalent to one-third of its
capital expenditure in 1974. For the public sector as a whole, savings in
1974 exceeded 10% of .DP and covered nearly 90% of capital expenditure.
On the balance-of-payments side, the terms of trade gain in 1974 was equivalent
tc about 11 of GDP and the trade surplus exceeded US4150 million. There was a
current account surplus of some USs5O million and net capital inflows approached
US$90 million, nearly four times their 1973 level, as a result of substantially
higher loan disbursements o the public sector and increased foreign investment
associated with hydrocarbon exq)loration. The net fcreign reserve gain in
1974--USv125 million--brought total reserves to US6156 million, equivalent to
3.7 months of imports, a high point in Bolivia's recent economic history.
7.        After the terms-of-trade related financial improvement in 1974, a
deterioration took place in 1975 caused by a worsening of the terms-of-trade
and the impact of world wide economic recession. Mineral exports fell by
well over 20%.  There was a decline of mineral prioes approximating 13%,
on weighted average, and saleable volumes of most minerals fell as a direct
result of the recession and unloading of speculative stocks accumulated
during the commodity boom Df 1973/74.  Efforts by the International Tin
*ouncil to sustain prices by imposing export quotas did not produce the expected



- 3 -
results. Exportable surpluses of crude petroleum were significantly reduced
for the second year in a row due to falling production and rapidly rising
domestic consumption of hydrocarbon derivatives.  A significant price
increase for natural gas was obtained from Argentina, but this could not
compensate for the overall decline in export earnings because of the contractual
limit on the volume of sales. Based on preliminary estimates, merchandise
ex)orts in 1975 declined by 20p, while imports rose by nearly one-third in
the wiake of the start-up of new public investment projects and the liberalizabion
of imports for consumer durables and motor cars earlier in the year. The
current account deficit approached US`220 million and despite substantially
increased disbursements of medium term loans to the public sector, there was a
loss of net foreign exchange reserves of some US360 million. However, this
still leaves reserves at US$100 million, or about two months of imports.
8.        Bolivia's terms of trade are expected to again improve in 1976 and
beyond. Mineral prices appear to have bottomed out in 1975 and hydrocarbon
prices have resumed their rising trend.   Furthermore, with gradual economic
recovery in industrialized countries mineral export volumes should increase.
Recent Government measures to increase prices of domestically consumed petroleum
products, especially of gasoline, should improve exportable surpluses. The
outlook for 1976, therefore, is for somewhat accelerated growth and an improved
fiscal and balance-of-payments position.
9.        Economic growth prospects over the medium- to longer-term depend on
the Government's ability to increase savings and stimulate investments,
particularly those for developing the countryt s hydrocarbon, mineral and
agricultural resources. Government measures designed to broaden the re-venue
base have begun to show results. The firm wage policies that have been
applied since 1974 have resulted in a reduction of inflation to an annual
rate of about o'. Investment in mining and hydrocarbons is accelerating.
Intensified exploration for hydrocarbons by YPFB and private foreign Companies
is underway and may lead to significantly increased production and export of
crude petroleum and natural gas which would stimulate an acceleration of
economic growth towards the end of the decade.
Debt Service and 2reditworthiness
10.       Service on external public debt in 1974 amounted to 13.6% of exports
of goods and norn-factor services net of investment income abroad. This
represents a considerable reduction from the debt burden of previous years which
frequently absorbed 15-20% of net export receipts.   Average terms of the external
debt outstanding have remained soft, reflecting the h-Lgh proportion of con-
cessionary aid channeled to Bolivia. Average interest in 1973 was 3.5% and
average maturity about 22 years.
11.       This position is bound to change, however, as it can be expected
that lending terms will become harder and the share of loGns on conventional
terms will increase. Of new loans attracted during 1974 and 1975, over 40%
were financial and suppliers' credits.   With subst-antial disbursements envisaged
during the next six years, the service on externa.l public debt will move
well above its historical average by 1977/73.   However3 as a result cf -rowing



-4-
exiorts, the debt service ratio should decline in subsequent years.  In view
of the nature and groATin- size of Bolivia's debt, prudence in selecting and
utilizin- extermal capital will have to become an essential element of debt
.mana eiment.
12.       Bolivia enjoys a substantial resource base in agriculture, minerals
and hydrocarbons which has to be developed to sustain rapid economic gro-.swth
and, in particular, rapid expansion of export earnings in the foreseeable
future.  If orcdctlcion in the ep)ort sectors can be increased as planned and
prices fcr the country's major export products (oil, gas, minerals) are
adequate, Bolivia can be considered creditworthy for substantially increased
amounts of external lending on conventional terms. Nevertheless, some additional
lendin, on soft terms is justified by Bolivia's poverty and its large and
continaing external capital requirements.  The country will require substantial
external financin- of investment to supplement the domestic savinJs effort at
least until the early 1980s.  While the 3overnmment is makin- a serious effort to
mobilize domestic resources and prepare a development pro gram, implementation
of this program -ill require external assistance we]l in excess of the foreign
exchun,e component of suitable projects presently available for international
financing.  Although substantially increased suppliers' and financial credits
--il robably become available, they shculd prudently cover not more than 35% of
uhe rublic canital inflows required durin- 1975-80 for meeting a .DP gro-wth
target of 6-7% annually. The remainder should be obtained on softer terms.
preferably from international development financing agencies, includin. an
expanded Bank lending program. The need for concessional financing to safe-
zuard Bolivia's creditworthiness, together with the country's relative poverty
and imoroving development performance, make it eligible for lcans cn Third
:.'indow terms.
P.ART II - THE BINK J1ROUF OPERATIONS IN BOLIVI.4
13.       Bolivia is an original member of the Bank but it did not obtain 'ank
2rour resources until 1964. Bank krou- assistance to Bolivia has been limited
by the country's tight budget and restricted capacity to service external debt.
Until 1975, lending to Bolivia was in the form of IDA\ credits, except for a
rank ioan to help finance an "enclave' project.  Because of the narrow scope for
private investment, the first IFp investment, amounting to US&3400,000 in a cable
and plastic products enterprise, was not made until 1973.   =nnex II contains a
surmiary statement of loans, credits and investments as of December 31, 1975, and
notes on the status of ongoing orojects. IDl has provided three credits
exclusively for livestock development (US410.2 millicn), one credit for livestock
and crop development (Us.y.5 million), four credits for power generation and
distribution (US.;$28.4 million), one credit to the railwajTs (Us.S8 million) and
one for mining (US.s6.2 million).  In addition to the Bank loan (US.i23.3 million)
to help finance a project for the construction of a pipeline to transport
natural gas to Argentina, the Bank has financed a loan (U.3.~2 million) for
the Second Railway project.
14.       Ihe proposed loan would be the Bank's third and the fourteenth Bank
.r-un operation in Bolivia.  N\et of undisbursed balances, Bolivia's debt to the
-ank and IDA in 1974/75 represented 8 .3O of its external public indebtedness.



This ratio might increase slightly by 1980 as might the share of the Bank
Group in total debt service, now at about 4%. Although the Bank Group has
ranked below the US jovernment and the IDB as a source of financial assistance
to Bolivia, its role has been expanding.
15.       Future Bank lending will give emphasis to supporting Government
efforts to expand production while simultaneously improving the distribution
of the benefits of economic growth. Many Bank activities will focus on
helping the less developed regions of the Altiplano and the intermediate valleys
which contain the majority of Bolivia's rural and urban poor. At present,
four projects are at an advanced stage of processing. These include a project
to finance the expansion of electric generation and transmission capacity of
ENDE, which will be the Bank's fourth operation with ENDE; a project to provide
credit for established private and predominantly Bolivian owned medium-sized
mining enterprises and private industry, which will operate through a private
development Bank and will be the Bank's second operation with that institution;
a project with the state owned Mining Bank to provide credit to smaller private
mining enterprises that have thus far had little capital investment; and a project
for the water supply and sanitation sector for small urban and rural areas.
Project preparation has begun for agricultural projects which will be designed
to increase the productivity of the poorer farmer and an education project which
will seek to improve primary rural and non-formal vocational education.
Financing of further economic infrastructure is also contemplated in the trans-
portation and power sectors.  In transportation, project preparation is under-
way for a project to provide access to remote areas of the country through a
program of airport develcpment and continued support for the railway rehabil-
itation program is planned as well. In the more distant future, further Bank
programs in agriculture, industry and mining will be under consideration.
16.       A major objective of Bank lending to Bolivia will be to help the
Government to improve the performance of agriculture, where priority will be
given to the needs of subsistence farmers and to sustaining the production
momentum generated by the commercial farmers in order to keep established and
develcp new markets for Bolivia's agricultural exports. We see the Bank's
role in agriculture as that of a catalyst in identifying and helping the Govern-
ment finance high priority projects which would contribute to diversifying
Bolivia's exports and at the same time create additional employment opportunities
and raise the productivity and income of the farm population.
PART III - THE RURAL SECTOR
17.       Overall performance of the agricultural sector during 1968-74 was
mixed and there was a decline in the sectcr's relative importance.   Thus, while
GDP growth during 1968-74 averaged about 4.8e p.a., that of agriculture grew
only at 3.9% p.a. and the sector's share of GDP decreased from a high of 30%
(1962) to about 21% in 1974.  In spite of agriculture's relatively small
contribution to total exports (about 9%) the volume of agricultural exports has
lately been increasing faster than in the past. The increase has come from



- 6 -
the exceptional expansion in commercial a-ricultural production of livestock,
cotton, sugarcane and soybeans in the Eeni and Santa Cruz re7icns.
18.       The farmers and ranchers in the northern and eastern lowlands of
the Beni and Santa 3ruz regions have large-size landholdings and enjoy sub-
stantia]. financial support from central and local governments. Modern
techniques are used, especially in the mechanized production of cotton and
sugarcane in Santa !ruz.  The marketing arrangements are better developed in
this region, as are processing industries and services.  Arable virgin land
is relatively abundant. The exceptional growth in commercial agriculture
stimulated by hi-h prices for cotton, sugarcane and livestock on the world
markets, was achieved mainly through bringing additional land under cultivation,
a reasonable supply of credit and mechanization. Some small gains in the
production of foods for domestic consumption have also been made by the sub-
sistence farmers in the Altiplano and the intermediate valleys which account
for about 85% of Bolivia's total farm population.  They were achieved mainly
by additional inputs of labor and utilization of some improved seeds rather
than by any si-nificant incre:ase in the flow of credit, increase in acreage
and introduction of improved technology.
19.       Agricultural credit in Bolivia is supplied by the Banco Agricola de
Bolivia (BAB), by the Central Bank through its rediscount operations and by foreign
banks operating in Bolivia. In general, medium- and long-term agricultural
credit in Bolivia is scarce and its allocation between subsistence and commer-
cial farmers has been highly skewed in favor of large-and medium-size
commercial farmers. Of all available agricultural credit, about 80% is
estimated to have been lent to commercial farmers in the Santa Cruz and Beni
regions, despite the fact that Bolivia's rural sector is still composed mainly of
smnall farmers. The majority of the latter use primitive plows and digging tools,
mostly native varieties of seeds and employ intensively family labor in land
preparation, seeding, weed control, livestock management, harvesting and in
domestic activities such as weaving and spinning. Labor is the most important
of all production factors which is supplied almost exclusively by the family
and complemented only as required from the traditional community labor pools.
The majority of small farmers live in poor economic and social conditions but
are, in general, self-sufficient and somewhat skeptical of efforts by outsiders
to change their life styles. The families are usually large, mainly of Aymara
origin in the Altiplano and of Quechua origin in the intermediate valleys.
Aymara and Quechua also are the native spoken languages which predominate
over Spanish in these regions.
20.       Landholdings of subsistence farmers range from one-half hectare in
the vicinity of Lake Titicaca and the Cochabamba Valley to 25-50 hectares in
some of the drier areas of the Altiplano (elevation of 10,000 to 14,000 feet)
and the intermediate valleys (elevation of 4,000 to 10,000 feet) and the eastern
slopes of the Andes (Yungas). In general, this landholding pattern is largely
a result of the Agrarian Land Reform implemented in 1952. Since the initiation
of the Reform, large tracts of land in the Altiplano and the intermediate
valleys have been sub-divided to accommodate additional members of the family.
Productivity in these regions has remained low as the 1952 Land Reform was not



- 7 -
followed-up with complementary programs to organize cooperatives, upgrade
supplementary services, provide the inputs to bring the land into more
productive use and assist the fanmers in marketing the produce. Nevertheless,
the small-farm sector produces about two-thirds of the domestic food supply and
provides some form of productive employment to about 65% of the rural
inhabitants. Population growth is relatively high in the rural areas, but
migration to urban centers and to the more productive rural areas of Santa Cruz
and the Beni regions keep the net increase low.
21.       Agricultural activities in these areas art characterized by stagnant
technology and low factor productivity, limited skilled manpower, inadequate
factor and product markets, and lack of access to agricultural credit,
especially medium- to long-term credit,to finance agricultural infrastructure
and agricultural inputs. The problem is further compounded by the lack of
viable farmer organizations, adequate infrastructure and supporting serrices.
In addition, political and economic instability, lack of institutional
coordination and the absence of an integrated approach to rural development
have made it difficult to successfully assist the Government in its efforts
to develop agriculture, particularly in the Altiplano.
22.       However, there is evidence that productivity and living standards
of the rural poor can be improved considerably provided the Goverrment takes
a number of essential measures. These would consist of the following:
(a) preparation and execution of investment programs and the establishnenL. u
a proper institutional framework to execute such programs in the Altiplano, the
intermediate valleys and the eastern slopes of the Andes (Yungas); (b) channel-
ing of adequate credit and technical assistance to small farmers in support of such
programs; (c) organizing small landholders into cooperatives or other functional
groups; and (d) research to develop appropriate crop varieties for the climatic
conditions of the Altiplano, the intermediate valleys and the Yungas.
23.       The present administration is well aware of the need to adopt such
measures and, with external assistance, has recently begun to channel more
financial and human resources to small farmers. A special office to coordinate
all the development activities in the Altiplano has been established with
the assistance of the UNDP. Capital investmenb projects in the Altiplano are
under preparation by IDB. Concurrently, the Government has begun to reform
the relevant institutions and to improve sector management capabilities.
Thus, in early 1974, the two previous Ministries of Agriculture and Rural
Affairs were merged. USAID is presently considering provision of technical
assistance to planning and supervision of investment programs. It is also
providing technical and financial assistance to the National Commiunity
Development Services (SNDC) in order to help this agency expand its role
since, so far, it has been active principally in financing infrastructure
projects in rural areas. IDB is planning assistance in the field of
agricultural research. Under IDA Credit 261-BO a reorganization study for
the Agricultural Bank of Bolivia (BAB) is being carried out in order to
improve the efficiency of this institution.. These actions are expected to
substantially improve planning, coordination and implementation of agri-
cultural develcpment programs.

FPART IV - THE PROJE`T
24.       The Bolivian Government had asked the Bank for assistance in
preparing a rural development project in the Altiplano in 1973. A first
FAO/Cooperative Program mission visited the Altiplano in October 1973 and
a second in November 1974 and reviewed the socio-economic study prepared
by the Government for the project. The project was appraised by a Bank
mission which visited Bolivia in May 1975. A report entitled "Appraisal
of Ingavi Rural Development Project, (No. 936-BO dated February 5, 1976)
is being circulated separately to the Executive Directors. A loan and
project summary is presented in Annex III. Negotiations took place in
Washington from January 5 to 9, 1976. The Government of Bolivia was
represented by Messrs. Alberto Valdez and Norberto Galdo.
Background
25.       The proposed project would be the first Bank operation for inte-
grated rural development in the Altiplano in Bolivia. Previous Bank Group
lending in the agricultural sector consisting of four IDA Credits has
been mainly directed at livestock development. However, the two most
recent credit operations, the Third Livestock Project (261-BO) and the
Agricultural Credit Project (561-BO) had a special component for small
farmers.
26.       The project area encompasses about 800 square km of the eastern
part of the Ingavi and the southern part of the Los Andes Provinces in the
Altiplano at about 13,000 feet altitude, some 20 km southeast of La Paz
(see map for further details). The area has about 60,000 inhabitants, the
majority of whom have net incomes which place them among the poorest 20%
of the population. Almost all farmers in the project area own their land
(6 ha on average). About 70% of them have already obtained a title to the
land, and the National Agrarian Reform Directorate is continuing its program
of issuing titles in the remainder of the project area. Assurances were
obtained that the Government would complete granting of land titles in the
project area by December 31, 1977 (Section 3.12, Loan Agreement).
Project Objectives and Content
27.       The principal objective of the project is to raise the living
standards of subsistence farmers' families in the eastern part of the Ingavi
Province and the southern part of the Los Andes Province through higher income
and improved health conditions. The main thrust of the project will be to
increase production of 4,000 project farmers and to provide complementary
infrastructure (85 km of roads; 20 irrigation wells) and social services
(six health posts; potable water supply) for all of the 10,000 rural families
presently living in the project area. With the use of improved seed,
additional fertilizer, supplementary irrigation, and improved breeding stock,
yields can be more than doubled and incomes increased accordingly. These
increases can be achieved, however, only through a well coordinated package
of activities involving credit for investments and working capital, technical



- 9 -
assistance, supporting infrastructure, and some improvement of social
facil-ties which would directly help to improve the quality of life oil the
farmers. Because it is complex and the first comprehensive project of its
kind undertaken in the Altiplano, only about 40S of the total population in
the projecti area will benefit from the production component. If successful,
similar but larger projects could be prepared in order to accelerate
improvements in agricultural practices under the difficult ecological and
sociolcgical conditions of the Altiplano.
28.       The project would finance an integrated development package designed
to deliver improved production inputs and technical assistance to motivate
poor rural families to form farmers' groups, i.e., to participate in the
prcject, farmers would be required to join existing cooperatives or to form
new groups. The project would promote formation of a total of 80 farmers'
groups, 20 of which would be organized mainly to develop agricultural
production with irrigation and 60 groups to improve production under rainfed
conditions. At present there are alread-r about 40 farmers' groups in the
p'roject area.  She formation of new groups and the reorgan_zation cf the
present groups for the types of activities required by the project would
be facilitated by long tradition of the Altiplano farmers to work collectively.
Iroups are expected to have about 50 members each for the purpose of the
proj'ect.
29.       About 1,000 farmers (in 20 groups) who presently own individual
tracts of land in the area where groundwater is available for irrigation
would be expected tc contribute, cn average, 1.5 ha for the formation of
blocks of 7f5 ha of which about $0 ha would be _rrigated.  Land which is
presently operated collectively by these farmers would also be consolidated
intc blocks of 75 ha for project Purposes.  Each of the 20 grcups would have its
ctTr irrigation well, a pcwer operated pinmp and tractor services.  A typical group
of 50 farmrers wTould irrigate the 50 ha collectively and would grow traditional
zrops mairl-y (potatcoes, vegetaoles, quinoa,l/ alfalfa/fescue and green
barl-ey) improve li-estock (dairy cattle and sheep) and share in the services
of tractors, livestock and storage facilities and technical assistance. A
minir.4nx ofr 30 members would be set for irrigation grouTps to ensure a
reasonably wide distribution of bernefits from the limited water supply
available. ;onsequently, assurances were obtained that the Govermnent
wculd require groups undertaking irrigated develcpment to have at least 30
members and 75 ha of irrigable land which would be operated as a unit.
(Slection 1.02(e), and paragraph B? of Schedule 5 tc the Loan Agreement.)
3J.       The remaining 3,0CC farmersr families would develop agriculture
under rainfed conditions.  Approximately, 1,000 of these farmers organized
in 20 groups each with 50 members, on average, would collectively work
single blocks of about 75 ha.  These farmers would develop the same crops
and livestock as menticned above although no vegetables would be grown and
1/ An Andean grain with high nutritional value.



- ic -
tractor services would be linited to planting alfalfa/fescue. The next 20
groups of approximately 1,000 families would consist of farmers who, although
working their scattered plots individually, would organize themselves to
receive technical assistance collectively, assume joint obligation for credit,
operate bull and ram breeding services and share common storage facilities.
The last 20 groups of farmers would consist of those who may want to cooperate
in sharing of storage facilities only. IWith better marketing assured, they
would improve their livestock operation on the basis of forage crop develop-
ment and bull and ram stud services purchased from the other farmers' groups
in the project area.
Organization and Implementation
31.       A semi-autonomous Project Unit under the Ministry of Peasant Affairs
and Agriculture was established on December 18, 1975. It would have a Board
of Directors composed of a representative and alternate from each of the
participating ministries and agencies. Tfhe Project Unit would have two main
departments: The Services Department and the Engineering Department. The
Services Department would provide technical assistance to farmer groups on
crop and livestock development and on organization and management of groups.
The Engineering Department would be responsible for the purchase of 20 tractors
and their maintenance by farmer groups and it would supervise the construction
and operations of the irrigation systems. The Project Unit is headed by a
Bolivian Project M4anager who will he assisted by a team of internationally and
locally recruited specialists in the organization and operation of the Unit.
The appointment of these specialists is a condition of effectiveness (Section
6.01, Loan Agreement). In addition to financing the cost of the technical
services, the Bank is also providing US.;500,000 to cover 58% of the total
cost of the experts, beginning in 1976. However, should UNIDP funds become
available for this purpose in later years, a corresponding amount of the Bank's
contribution would be cancelled. The Project Manager and his staff would
implement the project according to the policy established by the Project Unit's
Board cf Directors, which would approve annual budgets and work plans and be
responsible for overall coordination of project activities among the participat-
ing agencies. Assurances were obtained that the Government would provide the
funds to maintain the Unit for the duration of the project development period
of about ten years (Sections 3.01 and 4.03 (a) (i), Loan Agreement) and that
the aforementioned Decree and the Statutes would not be modified without
the Bank's agreement (Sections 5.01 and 5.02, Loan Agreement).
32.       The Project Unit's personnel would live in the project area in order
to effectively carry out the daily coordination and implementation of the
project. The involvement and close support of the beneficiaries is crucial
for the success of the proposed development program. In order to gain the
confidence cf the farmers, every effort would be made to give them maximum
say in decision making by encouraging the fanmers to share the responsibility
for the operation and maintenance of project works. The Unit's personnel
would be directly involved in (i) assisting farmers in the preparation and
implementation of on-farm investment programs and (ii) the purchase of inputs
and marketing of crops and livestock; (iii) implementing a program of
demonstration farm trials; (iv) training technicians and farmers; (v) purchasing



of 20 tractors and supervising their operation and maintenance; (vi) supervis-
ing the construction, operation and maintenance of the irrigation systems; and
(vii) supervising the construction, operation and maintenance of the livestock
and storage facilities. In addition, the Unit will sign separate contracts
with the Military Geographic Institute (I-24) for mapping of the irrigated
areas, the Geological Survey of Bolivia (JEOBOL) for the installation of 20
deep wells for irrigation, the National Cormunity Development Services (SNDC)
for construction of the irrigation and drainage works, the lNational Roads
Services (SNC) for improvements of gravel roads and with the Ministry of
Social Security and Public Health (MPSSP) for the construction of the health
posts, waste facilities and wells for drinking water. Signing of a separate
agreement between the Project Unit and each of the aforementioned entities
for the work involved has been made a condition of disbursement of the amount
of the loan allocated for the corresponding category. (Section 3.06 and
Schedule 1, paragraph 3 (i)).
33.       A monitoring unit would be established by February 1, 1977 within
the Project Unit to measure for ten years the impact of the project, provid-
ing project management with a decision-making tool and evaluating the sound-
ness of technical, financial and economic assumptions in order to develop
standards on the basis of which the project might be replicated in other
parts of the Altiplano and Bolivia. (Sections 3.08 and 4.03 (a) (ii), Loan
Agreement).
Credit Arrangements and "ost Recovery
34.       About $5 million of the proceeds of the loan would be relent by the
Central Bank to BAB which wiould provide farmer groups with subloans to finance
the cash cost of production inputs and of on-farm investments (including
irrigation systems and tractors). Contributions of the farmer groups would
be in the form of labor. Maturities of subloans would vary from a minimum of
six months in the case of some production inputs to a maximum of 20 years for
irrigation systems. Grace periods would vary from two to five years. Loanis
for on-farm investment and for working capital would carry an interest rate of
12<, the rate being charged by BAB to small farmers under IDA's 3redits 261-Bo
and 561-BO.
35.      Farm plans and subloan applications would be prepared by the Project
Unit and, after approval of the Project Manager, would be fornarded to the
Bolivian Agricultural Bank (BAB) for disbursement of funds. Signing of a
Subsidiary Loan Agreement between the Central Bank and BAB is a condition of
disbursement of the amount of the loan allocated to credit for farmers
(Section 3.09 (c) and Schedule 1 paragraph 3 (b), Loan Agreement). Supervision
of farm plan implementation would be undertaken by the Project Unit and
authorization by the Project Unit would be required for each disbursement
against a farm plan. BAB would provide staff to collect repayments of subloans
and the Project Unit would administer collection. In order to perfolm its
project functions, BAB would establish an office in Viacha. BAB
would repay the Central Bank project aco.ount--,'ith l1o interest--only as payments
were received from sub-borrowers and therefore would not carry any finl ncial
risk.  As compensation for its participation, BA3 wcu'd thus receilve a margin



- 12 -
of 2p% on outstanding subloan balances.  The Central Bank would receive a
commission of 1/4/'O on outstanding subloan amonmts for its services.
Assurances ,Pere obtained that repayment of subloans be relent in the project
area for similar purposes (Section 3.09 (e), Loan Agreement).
36.       Except for direct productive investment (other than technical
assistance), the cash cost of which will be recovered through the credit
mechanisom, the cost of investments under the project will not be fully
recovered. However, beneficiaries would contribute a substanti-l amount of
m.rskilled labcr to-;a-,' project waorks, valued a-t about .p3.4 million at market
orices.  A cash contribu-tion towards the construction of drilled potable
water wells of 5'0 of the cost of these wells would be required from
beneficiaries since little unskilled  abor could be employed in this
pirticular case (Section 3.9) (c), Loa.-. greeme:it).
I iarketing
37.       The annual incremental crop production generated by the project
would, in part, be ccnsumed on the farm and the surplus would be sold either
at local market fairs or at the urban markets of La Paz which can be reached
from the project area in about 30 minutes by road. The Project Unit would
assist the farmers in marketing output frcm the project and would provide
farmer groups with timely infcrmation about prices in La Paz and help them
arrange for transportation to markets. Lil; prcduced by the project's farmers
u(ld be s&ld so the :3overnment-o-nved Industrialized i4ilk Plant (PIL) which
is located near La Paz.  PIL's present, limied milJ collection operations
oculd need to be exp)-nded to absorb the incremental production generated by
she project.  Assurances were obtained that the 3overnnent would cause PIL
to collect milk from project beneficiaries at least once a day and would insure
that PIL had sufficient facilities and staff to assure timely collection
(Section 3.11 (a), Loan Agreement). In addition, assurances were obtained that
the lovernment would prepare, -within one year of the date of effectiveness,
a comprehensive plan for the development of milk production in the northern
part, of the Altinlano (Section 3.11 (b), Loan Agreement).
38.       Farmgate prices have been rising steadily since 1970, reflecting
both world and domestic market trends.  Producer prices provide sufficient
incentives to farmers to make the proposed investments, and the storage
facilities contemplated would enable them to take advantage of the normal
seasonal price fluctuations.
Project Cost and Financing
39.       Total project cash costs are estimated at US.p12.9 million equivalent,
of which 03.6 million would be for on-farm investments, ?l.5 million for
incremental working capital, 32.1 million for technical services, 30.7 million
for roads, P0.9 million for waater and waste facilities, .0.3 million for the
power line, jO.l million for heal-th facilities and the rest for contingencies.
Of the total project cash cost, the Government would contribute US`3.3 million
or 25-'', the beneficiaries US0O.1 million or 4% and the Bank would finance the
balance of US.39.5 million or 745. The proposed loan vwould finance the



- 13 -
estimated foreign exchange cost of P5.1 million plus US&5.4 million of
local costs.  As noted in paragraph 12, some local cost financing is
justified in Bolivia to enable the Bank to make an adequate contribution
to meeting the country's external capital requirements.
Procurement and Disbursement
40.       Procurement of most farm inputs would be made by fanmer grroups
throu-h normal conmercial channels because the size and timing of individual
purchases would not be suitable for international competitive bidding (101B).
The 20 tractors will be purchased through local competitive bidding rather
than IJB. At least five foreign manufacturers have their representatives
in Bolivia and this will ensure adequate local competition. However, at
present only one fixm is permitted to sell tractors in the 40 to 110 horse
power range and prices for that particular range are relatively high.
Assurances were obtained that the Government will permit the importation
of tractors in this horse power range on equal terms for all bidding firms
(Section 3.16, Loan Agreement). The tractors would be purchased in two
groups of ten each. The total amount involved would be US.i0.7 million. The
pumps, motors, casings and screens for the irrigation wells also would be
grouped in lots of ten and purchased (USi0.3 million) through LIB in
accordance with Bank guidelines. The wells would be installed by GEOBOL.
Construction and improvement of the roads wTould be undertaken by SIN on force
account, using unskilled labor supplied by project beneficiaries. Construction
of water distribution and drainage systems and improvements of natural drainage
would be undertaken by the National Comnunity Service (SIDO). .onstruction of
simple adobe buildings and other facilities would be carried out by project
beneficiaries under the supervision of SNDC.  The wells for drinking water ald
the privies (US61 million) would be installed by force account, with the
assistance of unskilled labor supplied by project beneficiaries.
41.       Proceeds from the Bank loan and the Government's contribution
would be channeled through the Central Bank to B-. and the other participating
agencies.  She Bank would disburse 72,' for on-farm investments, incremental
working capital, roads, health, water and waste facilities and 8as4 for
technical services.  Disbursements would be spread over about five and one-
half years.
Special Risk
412.      Launching the proposed project in the Altiplano implies taking
special risks, particularly since the results obtained in this region by
other institutions have been mixed and inconclusive. Therefore, during
preparation a special effort was made to analyze past ex)perience with other
projects. As a conclusion it was found that the main identifiable risk
elements are the follow-:
(i) insufficient interest on the part of fanners to participate
effectively in the project;



- 14 -
(ii)  deficiencies in the institutions involved in project
implementation; and
(iii)  shortfalls in reaching projected production targets because
of technical factors.
43.       In view of this, the project deliberately relies on traditional
methods of farm organization and farm,ers cooperation currently practiced in
varying degrees in the project area. The project is designed to insure
maximum participation by farmer groups in decisions affecting not only
their investments but also their life style. Field demonstrations and
technical and organizationaL assistance by Bolivian staff would be provided
in a manner to motivate farmers to accept the proposed production methods
and to utilize effectively the various services offered under the project.
b4.       The Project IJnit was established since no existing agency was
found entirely suitable to execute this complicated project. Particular
attention will be paid to staffing the Unit with a group of well qualified
and dedicated professionals.  They would be expected to work closely with
farmer groups to help them make investment decisions based on thorough
evaluation o-f soil and climatic conditions in the project area. These
conditions are comnaratively better in the project area than elsewhere in
the Altiplano and, therefore, fairly good results might be expected. However,
because of the inadequate crop production records in the provinces in question,
the projected production increases are rough estimates only and there remains
a substantial degree of uncertainty with respect to variation in yields that
farmers may encounter. In view of the uncertainties involved, the project
would have to be monitored exceedingly closely and modifications may have to
be introduced quickly during the implementation of the project. Nevertheless,
the Bolivian Government is willing to assume the risks involved in order to
improve production and living standards of poor farmers in the Altiplano,
and it considers the Bank's support for this experiment of crucial importance.
Economic Benefits and Justification
About 60,000 persons living in the project area would benefit from
road improvement's; 485000 from health, potable water and waste facilities;
and about 2L,000 from on-farm investments and working capital. Disguised
rural unemployment would be reduced and additional demand for supporting
jobs (machinery operators, mnechanics, traders) would be increased. As a
result of the project, participating farmer groups would increase their
net family income as follows (in US$):

46.       The project would also have a beneficial environmental impact
in the Provinces of Ingavi and Los Andes. The implementation of the mixed
farming system would improve the balance between the animal stocking rate
and carrying capacity of the land. The introduction of improved land
management practices is likely to reduce soil erosion, which is a serious
problem throughout the Altiplano and the irrigation and drainage works
would reduce the salinity problem in part of the project area.
O7.       The best estimate of the project economic rate of return is 15%.
In calculating the rate, half of the costs of the health, water supply and
the waste systems were included because access to these facilities would
increase labor productivity and therefore, would be reflected in greater
agricultural output. Sensitivity analysis shows that variations in yields
by 10% from those projected would result in rates of return of 12% and 19%,
respectively. approximately the same rates of return would result from 10%
variations in prices received by farmers or cost paid by them.
PART V - LEGAL INSTRUMENTS AND AUTHORITY
48.       The draft Loan Agreement between the Republic of Bolivia and the
Bank, the Report of the Committee provided for in Article III (Section h4 iii)
of the Articles of Agreement, and a draft Resolution approving the proposed
loan are being distributed to the Executive Directors separately.
49.       Special condition of effectiveness would be that the experts in
project administration, groundwater irrigation, marketing and credit and
sanitary engineering have been employed.
50.       Features of the Loan Agreement of special interest are referred to
in paragraphs 26, 29, 31, 32, 33, 34, 36, 37, 40, 41 and 49 of this report.
51.       I am satisfied that the proposed loan would comply with the Articles
of Agreement of the Bank and with the established criteria for Third Window
loans.
PART VI - RECOMMENDATION
52.       I recommend that the Executive Directors approve the proposed loan.

C. PROJECTS IN EXECTJTION
Credit 261-BO - TWAird Livestock Development Project, US$6.8 million,
June 25, 1971:  Effective Date: September 15, 1971; Closing Date
June 30., 1977
After implewentation slowed down in 1974, the
proj,ect is now proceeding as scheduled and the
credit should be fully disbursed by the closing
date of June 30, 1977.
Credit 346 - Railway Project, US$8 million, December 1, 1972; Effective
Date: February 212 1973; Closing Date: Juno 30, 1976
All of the funds under the project have been committed.
Due to inflation, however, the funds available under
the credit have been insufficient to procure all of
the items included in the project. About 50% of the
items planned for procurement for the first project,
have been deferred for purchasing under the second
railway project. Materials and equipment ordered
under the project did not begin to arrive in Bolivia
until the last quarter of 1974.  Improvements have
been made in the management, operations, financial
condition and tariff structure of the railway.
Credit 433 - Third ENDE Power Project, Us$6 million, October 17, 1973;
Effective Date: October ib,  1969;  Closing Date: December 31, 1976
The Santa Cruz gas turbine was put into service in
December 1974. Because of delays in preparing bid
documents and possible future delays in equipment
delivery, completion of the various transmission line
and substation equipment components is expected to be
six months to two years behind the appraisal estimate.
The project's foreign and total costs are expected to
be 40-50o above appraisal estimates. Although the
beneficiary's recent financial performance has been
satisfactory, it needs additional tariff increases to
maintain its agreed upon 9% rate of return in 1976 and
future years.
Credit 455 - Mining Credit Project, US$6.2 million, January 18, 1974;
Effective Date: June 15, 19Th;  Closing Date:  June 30, 15
The project is proceeding as scheduled.

Procurement
Arrangements:           Procurement of most fann inputs would be made by
farner groups through noimal commercial channels
because the size and timing of individual purchase
would not be suitable for international cornpetitive bidding
(I2B). The 20 tractors will be purchased through local
competitive bidding rather than IJB. At least five
foreign manufacturers have their representatives in
Bolivia and this will ensure adequate local competition.
However, at present only one firn is pernitted to sell
tractors in the 40 to 112 horse power range and prices
for that particular range are relatively high.
Assurarnces were obtained that the Govermnent will permit
the importation of tractors in this horse power range
on equal tenns for all bidding firms. (Section 3.16,
Loan Agreement). The tractors would be purchased in
two groups of ten each. The total amount invclved would
be US$60.7 million, The nlnmps, motors. 'asians Snd
screens for the irrigation wel3s also would be grouped
in lots of ten and purchased (US$0.3 million) through
IGB in accordance with Bank guidelines. Since the
above items are all imported no preference vill be given
to domestic bidders. The wells would be installed
(USQ0.7 million, excluding the UStp0.3 mill'iri for
purmps, etc.) by the ;Geological Survey of ,Boliria
(:.TEOBOL) imder agreement with the Project Unit. The
road work would be done by SNCG which will corduct field
investigations, prepare engineering plans and designs and
provide the necessary equipment, supplies and skilled
labor to carryout the work program (US$0.7 million).
Construction and improvement of the roads would be
undertaken by SNC on force account, using' laabor supplied
by project beneficiaries.  Construction of water dis-
tribution and drainage systems and imprcvements of
natural drainage would be undertaken by the N!ational
3ommunity Development Service (SN3C). Oonstruction of
simple adobe buildings and other facilities would be
carried out by project beneficiaries under the super-
vision of SNDC. The wells for drinking water and privies
would be installed (US$1 million) by the force account,
with the assistance of project beneficiaries.
Rate of Return:         The best estimate of the project economic rate of
return is 15A.
Appraisal Report:       ReDort No. 936-3Co dated February 7, '7o.
