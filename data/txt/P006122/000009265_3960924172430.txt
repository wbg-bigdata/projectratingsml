PREFACE
This is a performance audit of three projects designed to develop
the rural sector in five provinces of Bolivia's Highlands region, the
Altiplano, through on-farm credit, extension, and rural infrastructure.
The Ingavi project loan was approved in February 1976 in the sum of US$9.5
million and closed in October 1984 with US$3.1 million (33%) being
cancelled.  The Ulla Ulla  project  loan  and  credit  in the sum of US$9.0
million each were approved in January 1978 and closed in December 1986 with
US$5 million  (29%)  being  cancelled.    The  Commission  of  the European
Communities (EEC) provided parallel financing of the equivalent e' S$2.0
million.  The Omasuyos-Los Andes  project  credit was approved In  .  1979
in the sum of US$3 million and closed in December 1986 with US$0.9 million
(30Z) being cancelled.
The three projects have been covered in a single audit as they
were specifically poverty-oriented, their implementations ran in parallel,
they were located in contiguous geographical areas, and have been affected
by the same economic and social frameworks.
The audit report consists of an audit memorandum (PPAM) prepared
by the Operations Evaluation Department (OED), and three Project Completion
Reports (PCRs). The PCR for the Ingavi project was prepared by the Bank's
Latin America and Caribbean Regional Office, and the PCRs for the Ulla Ulla
and Omasuyos-Los Andes projects by the World Bank/FAO Cooperative Program.
The audit memorandum is based upon a review of Appraisal Reports, the
President's Reports, the L-oanlCredit and Project Agreements and PCRs.
Correspondence with the Borrower and internal Bank documents have been
consulted  and  Bank  staff   associated   with   the  projects  have  been
interviewed.
t  OED mission visited Bolivia in April 1988 about 18 months after
the loans were  closed.    Discussions  were  held  with  officials of the
Ministry  of  Peasant  Affairs   and  Agriculture,  the  two  institutions
implementing the projects (Institute for Rural Development of the Altiplano
and Natioul Institute for the Development  of Wool), the Central Bank, the
Agricultural Bank of Bolivia, and several bilateral and multilateral
donors. A field trip to the project areas provided additional information
to validate the conclusions of the PCRs.
The audit finds the PCRa generally accurate with respect to the
projects principal achievements and difficulties.   The points discussed by
the audit have been selected in the light of their importance for the
design and implementation of future rural investments aimed at assisting



- ii -
the Government in the development of Bolivian agriculture in general ard
Bolivia's Altiplano in particular.
The valuabln assistance prcrided  by the Government, its offiekals
and other donors and individuals met during the preparation of this audit
memorandum is gratefully acknowledged.
Following customary OED procedures, copies of the draft audit were
sent in October 1988 to the Government and to the Commission of the Euro-
pean Communities (EEC), cofinancier of the Ulla Ul'a project. Comments
from EEC and from the Borrower have been taken into account in prepariag
the final report and are also included as Attachments * and II.

PROJECT PERFORMANCE AUDIT REPORT
BOLIVIA
INGAVI RURAL DEVELOPMENT PROJECT (LOAN 1211-BO)
ULLA ULLA DEVELOPNENT PROJECT (LOAN 1510-BO/CREDIT 762-BO)
OMASUYOS-LOS ANDES RURAL DEVELOPMENT PROJECT (CREDIT 933-BO)
EVALUATION SUMMARY
Introduction
The three projects covered by this audit report comprise the
entire IDA/Bank assistance to Bolivian agriculture in general, and rural
development in particular, between 1976  and  1987.   In the mid-1970s, the
Government's strategy for agriculture and rural development emphasized the
reduction of the country's dependence on imported foodstuffs and the
alleviation of acute poverty and underemployment in Bolivia's Highlands --
the Altiplano. For the latter objective, public agricultural investment
was directed towards integrated rural development projects to provide basic
social services to increase the productivity of subsistence agriculture.
The Ingavi project was the first example in Bolivia of such an integrated
approach and was  followed,  relatively  quickly,  by  the  Ulla  Ulla and
OmAsuyos-Los Andes projects as development models for the region of the
Altiplano and the adjoining intermediate valleys. Earlier IDA assistance
to Bolivia included two simple agricultural credit projects for commercial
beef development in the tropical lowlands and another two credit operations
(1971-1980) in support of small-scale farmers in the Altiplano. 1/ The four
IDA operations had a positive impact on cattle management and beef
production but did not achieve their institutional and sectoral objectives.
Obiectives
The Ingavi, Ulla Ulla and Omasuyos-Los Andes projects aimed at
increasing crop or livestock production and beneficiary incomes by forming
farmer groups to facilitate delivery of services (technical assistance and
credit), and providing social infrastructure on a province-wide basis in
Bolivia's Altiplano.   These multi-objective  projects  focussed on income
generation and distribution, community participation and food production
and emphasized replicability.
The Ineavi Rural Development Proiect scught to achieve its
objectives  in  the  Ingavi   province,   benefitting  10,000  families  by
establishing a new and autonomous unit to administer the project and
provide improved production services (organization of farmer groups,
extension, animal health); providing agricultural credit through the
Agricultural Bank of Bolivia; and constructing 20 deep wells to irrigate
1,000 ha, 4,000 shallow wells for drinking water, rural roads and other

social infrastructure. The project cost was estimated at US$12.9 million
and the Bank loan of US$9.5 million was to be disbursed over five and half
years.
The Ulla Ulla Development Prolect was designed as a phased
development of the alpaca/llama livestock sector in the Ulla Ulla region to
the Northeast of Lake Titicaca   and of related fiber processing capacities
in the La Paz area, benefitting 6,400 families. The project included 16
components for livestock development (experimental sta4ion, alpaca/llama
commercial farms, credit, extension services); a wool collection network
and a wool processing plant; rural roads; social infrastructure; and
women's participation in health and nutrition training. The project cost
was estimated at US$24 million and IDA/Bank financed US$18 million to be
disbursed over five  years      The  Commission  of the European Communities
provided parallel financing in the amount of US$2 million equivalent.
The Omasuvos-Los Andes Rural Development Project aimed at reaching
6,000 small-scale families in two provinces to increase their agricultural,
livestock and forestry production.   The beneficiaries were to be organized
in farmer groups which were to receive integrated agricultural packages,
including credit and technical assistance; other instruments comprised
roads, and drinking water and waste disposal facilities. The project cost
was estimated at US$9.3 million and the IDA credit of US$3 million was to
be disbursed  over  four  and  half  years.    The  International  Fund for
Agricultural Development provided parallel financing in the amount of US$4
million equivalent.
Implementation Experience
The implementation of all three projects experienced delays by
lack of final design of several components, lack of counterpart funds,
shortages and frequent changes of staff, and technical difficulties. Post-
appraisal developments such as political instability and the economic and
social crisis beginning in the early 1980s caused increased turnover at
ministerial and project management levels which made it extremely difficult
to carry on with development as was envisaged at the time of appraisal.
The agricultural credit components in each of the three projects functioned
during the early phases of the projects but were managed by the projects'
autonomous units, contrary to appraisal expectations.
In the Ingavi project the deep well irrigation component was not
carried out for lack of background studies which would have revealed
unsuitable soil and  climatic  conditions.    The  rural infrastructure was
generally carried out, including an  access  road.    Of the loan of US$9.5
million, US$3.1 million was cancelled.
In the Ulla Ulla project the road component was completed as was
much of the rural  infrastructure.    The  improvement  of alpaca and llama
herds did not take place, and the main intended investment activity of the
project -- an integrated scheme of wool purchases and processing by a
specialized yarn plant -- was left uncompleted. A conservation program for
the endangered vicuina was carried out successfully. Of the credit/loan of
US$18 million, US$5 mil3ion was cancelled.



- xiv -
In the Omasuyos-Los Andes project, the technical services operated
during the earlier years, and farmer training took place. Both male and
female extension agents (the latter very important in the socio-cultural
context of the Altiplano), delivered extension programs in homemaking,
family health and  horticulture.    An  access  road was completed but the
health infrastructure reached only 4% of targets and the forestry component
was a failure.   Of  the  IDA  credit  of  US$3 million, US$0.9 million was
cancelled.
Results and Sustainability
Government  activities   (irrigation,   forestry,   research,  and
extension) under all three projects fell short of their envisaged scope in
virtually every area, and the actual achievements have still to be proven
sustainable at present input levels.    The credit and technical assistance
components cannot be maintained by the existing institutional framework.
However, public social investments (rural roads, health and education
facilities), while also falling short of their phydical targets to some
extent, were relatively successful and appear to offer better prospects for
sustainability. As for private investments (on-farm inputs and investments
supported by agricultural credit) the achievements generally fell short of
their targets, but were successful, if only for a few years. In the
absence of follow-on support activities, their longer-term outlook is in
doubt.
Findings and Lessons
Having been prepared and implemented under almost the same
macroeconomic conditions, sharing the conceptual basis and being directed
at nearly identical populations and environments, it should not be
surprising that the implementation experiences of the three projects and
their present situation have much in common:
- the project design was too complex, particularly in view of
Bolivia's   scarcity   of   administrative,   managerial  and
technical personnel, the geographic  isolation of the project
areas, and the novelty of some of the projects' components
(PPAM, para. 18);
-   the projects were  designed  to  be  managed  by ad-hoc units
rather than by line agencies. These units ceased to function
at the end of the projects and are not sustainable (PPAM,
para. 19).2/
The following lessons can be drawnt
- a proper understanding of the project areas, their socio-
economic structure and their traditions and values would have

units are more operational than line agencies for implementing
rural development projects, although there is a greater risk that
they will not be sustained.

prevented  or  at  least   mitigated,  some  serious  project
shortcomings (PPAM, paras. 55-57);
the outcomes of the three projects confirm the conclusions
made in a recent review of rural development investments,
particularly in regard of the negative effects of project
complexity (PPAM, paras. 58-60); and
lack of adjustment for inflation in one credit scheme has
completely undermined its sustainability (PPAM, paras. 61-64)
and given rise to substantial unintended subsidies and losses
to Government (PPAM, paras. 65-66).

OMASUYOS-LOS ANDES RURAL DEVELOPMENT PROJECT (CREDIT 933-BO)
I. PROJECTS' BACKGROUND
A. Agricultural. Economic and Social Setting
1.       Bolivia consists of three  major agro-climatic regions extending,
at different altitudes, in a North-South direction over the entire country.
By far the largest is the zone of the Eastern Lowlands, a vast, sparsely
populated and little developed expanse of tropical forest which occupies
60% of the  country's  land  area.    With  high  temperatures and rainfall
throughout the year, the Lowlands can produce two annual crops. Commercial
farming concentrates on sugarcane and cotton and subsistence farming, on
cassava and bananas, with rice being grown for both purposes and cattle
raising complementing agriculture.
2.       The Valleys amount to about 15% of Bolivia's land area; they are a
transition zone between the Eastern Lowlands and the Altiplano/Mountains
area. Altitudes range from 800 to 3,500 m and soil and climatic conditions
vary greatly. Agriculture is limited to about one tenth of this zone.
Besides fooderop production (grains, vegetables), pork and poultry are
raised and market-oriented dairy farming is practiced.
3.       The Altiplano/Mountains  region  occupies  roughly  one quarter of
Bolivia's land area, in the Center and West of the country. About half of
this area lies at elevations of more than 4,500m and does not permit either
agriculture or animal husbandry. The other half, the Altiplano, an inter-
mountain plain stretching from Lake Titicaca to the Argentinian border, is
characterized by cold and dry winters and low rainfall, a climate which
limits severely the  agriculturale  options:    limited foodcrop production
(tubers and  cereals)  alternate with  low-productivity  livestock ra.4ing
(cattle, pork, poultry, and llama and alpaca at higher elevations), mmstly
for on-farm consumption.
4.       Bolivia's population is very  unevenly  distributed;   there  is a
striking difference between the sparsely populated and largely undeveloped
sub-tropical lowlands of the East (where most commercial non-food crop
production and 25% of the food for national consumption is produced); and
the highly populated Altiplano-Valleys area of the West and Center where
small-scale traditional agriculture supplies a large part of the food
consumed in the urban centers of the Altiplano, including La Paz. Less
than 20% of the Altiplano area has potential for crop production; most of
this area is in the Department of La Paz, where the three project areas are
located.  The average holding on  the  Altiplano varies from 2 ha near Lake
Titicaca to 4-5 ha in  the  high  valleys,  but  the planted areas are much
smaller due to the need  to  leave  land  in  fallow.  The entire Altiplano
region is highly dependent on livestock  production, with a population of 6
million sheep, 1.6 million llamas and alpacas, and 1 million cattle.



5.       There are intricate demographic  links  between these three zones.
Bolivia's main ethnic and linguistic groups (Quechuas, Aymaras, Guarayos
and others), all with distinct sccio-economic and cultural traits, have for
thousands of years, occupied areas that extend across the country in an
East-West direction.    This  permitted  them  to  avail  themselves of the
production diversity of three different climatic and agricultural systems.
The movements of people and goods along an East-West axis maximized
employment and production by farming or livestock-keeping thoughout the
year in dry and  cold  highlands,  in humid  valleys, and in warm tropical
areas.l/
B. Obiectives and Design of the Project
6.       Gevernment's previous  and  present  strategy  in the agricultural
sector supported by the Bank, is directed at reducing the country's
dependence on imported foodstuffs and alleviating acute poverty and
underemployment in the traditional agricultural sector -- the Altiplano.
For the latter objective, public agricultural investment was directed
towards integrated rural development projects to provide basic social
services, infrastructure, marketing and credit, and extension services.
The Ingavi project was the first example in Bolivia of such an integrated
approach and was followed, relatively quickly, by the Ulla Ulla and
Omasuyos-Los Andes projects, as development models for the region of the
Altiplano and  intermediate  valleys.    Within  that  strategy, Government
recognized the difficulties in bringing about an orderly development of the
Altiplano, because of its limited resources and harsh climatic conditions,
and where the population has traditionally been little receptive to change
and even, to some extent, suspicious and unapproachable. The Bank also was
aware of these difficulties and the loans were approved by the Board
recognizing these risks.
7.       The three projects covered by  this  PPAR provide the total of the
Bank's assistance to Bolivian agriculture in general, and rural development
in the Altiplano in particular, between 1976 and 1987. The Ingavi Rural
Development Project was Bolivia's first integrated rural development
project and followed similar undertakings elsewhere in Latin America.2/ All
three projects aimed at increasing crop or livestock production and
beneficiary incomes by forming farmer groups to facilitate delivery of
services  (technical   assistance   and   credit),   and  providing  social
infrastructure on a province-wide basis in Bolivia's Altiplano, where 60%
of the country's population is located, with severe climatic and resource-
base  constraints.    These multi-objective  projects  focussed  on income
generation and distribution, community participation, food production and
replicability.

Inpavi Rural Devel2oment Proiect
8.       The project was  a  follow-up  of  two  previous activities in the
Altiplano: (a) the IDA-financed Livestock Credit Project (Credit 261-BO)
which earmarked part of the livestock credit for the Altiplano;3/ and (b)
the United Nations Development Program (UNDP) Groundwater Survey of the
Northern and Central Altiplano, which indicated the availability of
groundwater for irrigation.
9.       The five-year project  sought  to  achieve  its  objectives in the
Ingavi Province by: establishing a new and autonomous Project Unit (PU) to
administer the project and provide improved production services (extension,
investment and short-term credit, farmer organization, animal health); and
constructing 20 deep wells to irrigate about 1,000 ha, 4,000 shallow wells
for drinking water, pit privies for about 3,000 families, six health
centers, and 85  kms  of  rural  roads.    The  project  was to provide the
opportunity for Government to gain experience and devise a model for
development in the Altiplano. The autonomous PU was to be attached to the
Ministry of Peasant Affairs and Agriculture (MACA) and its Departments of
Engineering and Services would implement components or coordinate their
execution by six other Government departments.    The  PU  had a ten member
Board of Directors and its initial staffing was to be accomplished by
hirings from other  institutions.    The  appraisal  mission considered the
strengthening of an existing institution but  decided a new unit would be a
more effective way  to  coordinate  the  project  (para.  49).   The basic
productive benefit  assumptions  were  that  irrigation,  higher  levels of
production inputs, and improved agricultural practices would increase
yields and the  volume  and value  of  production.    The project cost was
estimated to be US$ 12.9 million, and the Bank loan of US$ 9.5 million was
to finance the foreign exchange equivalent plus US$ 4.4 million of local
costs.
Ulla Ulla Development Prolect
10.      The original project concept aimed  at a phased development of the
alpaca/llama livestock sector in the Ulla Ulls region and of related fiber
processing capacities in the La Paz area. Eventually, however, the five-
year project included 16 components for: livestock development (including
an  experimental  station  and   commercial  farm,  credit,  and  extension
services); a wool collection network and a wool processing plant; rural
roads; social infrastructure; and women's participation in health and
nutrition  training.    The  newly   created  National  Institute  for  the
Development  of  Wool   (INFOL)   was   to   be   responsible  for  project
implementation and was  to  enter  into  operational  agreements with other
Government departments  for  the  implementation  of  the  rural and social
infrastructure elements.    The  livestock  component  would  benefit 2,500
families, the wool handicraft industry 3,400, and the social infrastructure
3,000. The project's costs were estimated at US$ 24 million; the IDA
credit (US$ 9 million) and the Bank loan (US$ 9 million) would finance 100%
of the foreign exchange component of US$ 9 million and 60% of local costs.

The Commission of the European Communities and the Bolivian Government were
to share the financing of the remaining US$ 6 million.
Omasuyos-Los Andes Proiect
11.      The Omasuy,s-Los Andes project was identified in 1978 on the basis
of the initial experieace of the Ingavi project which had become effective
in July 1976. The four and a half year project aimed at reaching the
small-scale farm sector in the provinces of Omasuyos and Los Andes in the
northern Altiplano, to increase agricultural, livestock and forestry
production of 6,000 families.   The  beneficiaries  were to be organized in
farmer groups through which integrated packages were to be provided,
including credit and technical assistance, roads, and drinking water and
waste  disposal  facilities.      The   Omasuyos-Los  Andes  project  was  a
replication of  the  (then  still  ongoing)  Ingavi  project.   The project
components were: establishment and partially financing of a project unit
under a new agency created as a condition for the Credit, the Institute for
Rural Development of the Altiplano (IDRA); investment credit for 2,500 and
production credit for 6,000 farmers; a forestry program (establishment of a
nursery and long-term credit to reforest 600 ha); improvement of 50 km of
feeder roads; 4,000 pumps for shallow wells to supply drinking water; and
3,000 privies for sanitatior.. The productive benefits were to derive from
a more intensive cultivation of foodcrops, both for sale and on-farm
consumption. The project costs were estimated at US$ 9.3 million. The IDA
credit of US$ 3 million was to finance administrative and technical support
(US$  2.3  million)  and  rural  infrastructure  (US$  0.7  million).   The
Internatior l Fund for Agricultural Development (IFAD) cofinanced the
project through a loan of US$ 4 million to support the agricultural credit
and forestry components, and Government was to finance the remaining US$
2.3 million.
C. Board Concerns
12.      The Ingavi project was presented to the Board in February 1976 and
was explicitly characterized as  a  high-risk  operation.   While the Board
endorsed this approach in principle, concerns were raised about the
feasibility  of  forming  farmer   production  groups  or  associations  in
heterogeneous sub-areas and  populations.    However,  the explanation that
these  groups  would  not  be   formal  cooperatives  or  have  f.ll  legal
responsibility wa  deemed  satisfactory.    The  Ulla  Ulla project was not
explicitly seen as a high risk operation during Board presentation in
January 1978, but concerns about the possibility of quickly establishing a
multi-disciplinary organizational structure cutting across institutional
lines, and requiring well  paid  staff were  evident.    The Board did not
consider the Omasuyos-Los Andes project (July 1979) as a high risk
operation because of the Bank's previous experiences in the Altiplano, but
it did link the project's chances of success to the ability of retaining
well paid staff.
D. Related Projects
13.      The first two IDA operations in Bolivia's agricultural sector were
two simple agricultural credit projects for commercial beef development in
the tropical lowlands which were implemented between 1967 and 1974. The
projects were administered by a specially created Livestock Project



-5-
Division in the Agricultural Bank of Bolivia (BAB). Most of the project's
objectives were achieved one year earlier than expected.4/ The PPAR
concluded that the two projects had a positive impact on cattle management
and  beef   production,   and   that   the   Livestock  Division  performed
satisfactorily in appraising and supervising ranchers' investment programs,
even showing a modest profit in its operations. The PPAR also concluded
that BAB's financial situation steadily deteriorated during the projects'
implementation largely due to measures taken by the Government: imposition
of unprofitable lending programs, reduction in the interest rate for on-
lending and devaluation of the Bolivian currency (most of BAB's borrowings
were in foreign currency).
14.      The third and fourth IDA  operations (Credits 261 and 561-BO) were
also agricultural credit projects (1971-1980) through BAB, with the
following  aspects  distinguishing  them  from  their  predecessors:    the
extension of the beneficiary groups  to  include small-scale farmers in the
Altiplano; an . tempt to  charge  positive  interest rates by indexation of
the loan principal to large-scale beef farmers; and several studies aimed
at reorganizing BAB and rationalizing beef pricing and marketing.5/ The
achievements of the third and fourth operations were: BAB's agreement to
accept chattel mortgages for small-scale farmers instead of land titles,
the reinforcement of BAB's Livestock Division, and the establishment of an
evaluation and monitoring system.    The  projects  were also successful in
diversifying lending operations from the  lowlands  with its large farms to
small-scale farmers in tha Altiplano and Valleys regions. The projects
failed, however, in their institutional and sectoral objectives, which were
and remained beyond their control.   Because the indexation formula hqd not
been agreed upon during negotiations, lengthy discussions took place
between IDA, Government and ranchers, and it was not until June 1975 when
agreement was reached by all three parties concerned. The agreement was
not fully respected either by Government (which in 1978 unilaterally
lowered interest rates) or by farmers who, after two devaluations,
responded by increased defaults on repayments.
15.      The three rural development  projects under review were identified
and appraised during a period of favorable economic conditiovs. Between
1970 and 1978, real GDP grew at an annual average of 5.4%, bolstered by
buoyant export commodity prices, relative political stability, easy access
to external financing  and  high  gross  investments.    By contrast, their
implementation fell into a period of prolonged crisis: net foreign lending
ended abruptly in 1979/80 as Bolivia's foreign debt was deemed to have
become excessive, and it oecame apparent that past lending was not having a
significant development impact but was instead stimulating serious capital
flight. Since 1980 the Bolivian economy has steadily declined, reaching an
all time low in 1985 when inflation exceeded 20,000% in annual terms.
Between 1978 and 1985 agricultural GDP declined 7% but its share of total
GDP  increased  to  20%,   reflecting   the   sharp   drop  in mining  and
manufacturing.  The economic  policies  pursued  by Government between 1978

and 1985 worsened the general economic decline. Interventionist pricing
policies, maintenance of an overvalued exchange rate, and excessive
government expenditures (with the accompanying drain on domestic credit,
expansion of the public debt, and runaway inflation) created a macro-
economic environment hostile to growth in all sectors, particularly
agriculture. Since August 1985 the Government has been implementing a new
economic policy which so far has led to remarkable progress in controlling
inflation and in reestablishing order in the economy.
II. IMPLEMENTATION AND OUTCOMES
16.      The  performance  and  -'utcomes  of  all  three  rural development
projects need to be considered in the context of the following factors:
(a) Bolivia's Altiplano is populated by different indigenous peoples,
with traditions and farming techniques reaching back thousands of
years;
(b) all projects were appraised before the economic and social crisis
in the early 1980s which affected Bolivia deeply, but even under
normal circumstances these projects appeared optimistic in most of
their underlying assumptions; and
(C) the administrations of the three projects were unable to resist
local pressures injurious to the projects' interests, started but
did  not  always   complete   new   undertakings,  and  could  not
incorporate the experiences of their partner projects.
The three projects had several common experiences or suffered from the same
factors. Hyperinflation occurred between 1979 and 1985, the period during
which most of the projects' implementation took place. Several components
in each of the projects were poorly identified, designed or appraised. All
projects utilized enclave management units with complex coordination
arrangements with other institutions.   The management units have ceased to
exist. The agriculture credit components met with some success in their
productive objectives but failed in their institutional and sustainability
objectives. The projects were affected by low staff morale and continuous
changes in local staff.   The  common  and particular outcomes of the three
projects are discussed in the following sections.
17.      Having been prepared and implemented  under almost the same macto-
economic conditions, sharing the conceptual basis and being directed at
nearly identical populations and environments, it should not be surprising
that the implementation expe_ience of the three projects and their present
situation have much in common.
18.      First, there can be little doubt that the projects' design was too
complex, particularly in view of Bolivia's scarcity of administrative,
managerial and technical personnel outside the capital, as well as the
geographic isolation of the projecL areas  and  the novelty of some of the
projects' components.
19.      Second, and  in  response  to  the  before-mentioned  shortages of
specialized staff, it was decided to entrust project implementation to ad-



- 7 -
hoc management units rather than to Government line agencies. While such
an arrangement may look appealing because of the (apparent) avoidance of
inter-departmental rivalries, in many cases it creates more problems than
it helps resolve: the necessary coordination mechanisms are usually quite
complicated, the lack of a firm place of these "enclave' units in the
Government structure sometimes makes them dependent on the goodwill of the
participating  line  agencies,  the   problem  of  personnel  shortages  is
exacerbated rather than mitigated by the setting-up of additional agencies,
and because of their location outside the regular structure of line
agencies, their continued existence beyond the implementation period is not
automatically assured but requires continuous provision of adequate funds
to sustain follow-up activities.
20.      Third, such project implementation  units are subject to increased
staff turnover, partly in response to the temporary nature of these posts,
partly because at  the  top  levels  staffing  is  particularly affected by
political  changes.    A   volatile   political  situation  tends  to  have
destabilizing  influence   on   PIU   staffing   and   hence,   on  project
implementation.
21.      Fourth,  several  project   components   were  poorly  identified,
designed  or  appraised,   leaving   the   implementing  agencies  with  an
unrealistic framework for implementation.    This  problem is linked to the
first issue (of design complexity) but adds to it through overly ambitious
physical targets and a compressed time schedule.
22.      This set of  basic  weaknesses  would  have presented a formidable
challenge to the implementing agencies even under favorable economic and
political conditions.    In  the  event,  the  external  circumstances were
extremely adverses a prolonged period of hyperinflation in the early 19808
combined with extraordinary political and social instability which left
their marks on all three projects.
23.      It is interesting to r te  that these three projects, while taking
place in a rather unique physical environment, present insights almost
identical to the conclusions derived from a survey of issues in about 200
rural development projects financed by the World Bank.6/ There the root
causes of a project's difficulties were weaknesses in design, which could
take the form of excessive scope and complexity (particularly in view of
the frequent leck of previous relevant experience); awkward management
structures and implementation arrangements; and unrealistic implementation
plans. Other shortcomings, such as an absence of arrangements to assure an
adequate  flow  of   funds   to   the   projects;  inadequate  or  untested
technologies; and an unsatisfactory incorporation of technical assistance
inputs, have also made themselves felt repeatedly in the three projects
under review.    The  following  sections  will  examine  their experiences
individually.

A. Ingavi Project
Manasement
24.      The five-year project (1976-1981) was  closed after eight and half
years in March 1984. The project unit became operational in December 1976,
and was established under MACA.   The  project  unit had to deal with seven
other Government agencies and was burdened by a Board of Directors of ten
members with conflicting interests, who rarely met. The project unit was
absorbed in March 1979 into the newly created Institute for Rural
Development for the Altiplano (IDRA), which also coordinated the follow-on
project of Omasuyos-Los Andes. During the project's life, the project unit
and IDRA were plagued by frequent changes of Directors and consequently, of
almost all key staff, while ignoring Loan Agreement covenants which
required Bank approval  of  appointments  of  directors.    This called for
continuous training of new staff and antagonized the farmers' associations
which had to cope with an ever changing project management. Since 1986,
however, the same management team has been in place, allowing the
consolidation of some of the project's gains. At project's initiation in
1976/77 there was a staff of 120.   Because of low salaries and diminishing
morale, at project's closing only 30 remained, and at audit there were only
four agents to serve 4,000 families in the province at Ingavi and 8,000 in
Aroma (a province added to the project in December 1981 to receive
technical assistance and credit). IDRA estimates that for a continued and
proper coverage of the beneficiaries the required ratio of technicians to
families is 1:60, and that consequently a total staff of 67 would be needed
for Ingavi alone.7/
Achievements by Component
25.      Irrigation.  The  deep well  irrigation component, accounting for
16% of project costs, failed (PCR, paras. 3.06-3.07). Out of a target of
20 wells to irrigate 1,000 ha, only five test wells were installed and only
two maintained from 1983 to 1985. All were eventually abandoned, because
only a few micro-regions have the proper soil and climatic conditions to
obtain an adequate production response to irrigation, and because of the
difficulty to organize farmers' participation in irrigation arrangements.
A design flaw in the irrigation component arises from the fact that when
water is desired during the dry season, temperatures in the Altiplano are
often below freezing point and water cannot be provided.
26.      Extension Services.  Agricultural extension was inadequate to meet
the full requirements of the Altiplano traditional rural population (PCR,
paras. 3.08-3.09). There were simply not enough staff knowledgeable in the
local language and customs to serve the large and widely scattered
beneficiary population. But where and when the extension system operated
properly, it succeeded    in  organizing  farmers' organizations to receive
collective credit   and  in  giving  instruction  on simple farm practices,
7/ While a ratio of 1:60 is probably too high, the actual situation (four
agents for 12,000  families)  is  obviously  inadequate.   A supervision
report for the Omasuyos project (dated January 27, 1984) suggested a
ratio of 1:250 as suitable for the Altiplano; this would translate into
a total requirement of 48 agents for the two provinces.

mainly the use of improved seeds, fertilizers and land preparation.
Between 1977 and 1987, 350 courses were given to a total of 9,000 farmers,
and as a complementary activity, project veterinarians treated about
350,000 animals.
27.      Infrastructure.      The   rural   infrastructure  components  were
generally carried out as foreseen (a'CR, para. 3.02). The road component
exceed appraisal expectations by 142 and the planned six health centers
were constructed in locations which can be reached by project and non-
project beneficiaries. The centers were staffed and are functioning seven
days a week. Only 30% of appraisal targets for waste disposal were met;
family water supply benefitted from the use of a simple but durable
handpump designed and patented by the project (over 1,200 pumps were
delivered to beneficiaries).
28.      Credit.  Several  basic  objectives  of  the credit component were
achieved, despite inadequate institutional and administrative arrangements
which restricted the scope of  the  programs    farmers in the project area
were, for the first time, exposed to institutional credit, organized into
farmer groups to apply for credit, and experienced higher yields as a
result of introducing agrochemicals. Unfortunately, the failure to improve
the management of the credit component resulted in excessive staff use,
almost fully  subsidized  credit,    and  erosion  of  the  value of credit
repayment. (These latter issues are discussed further in paras. 61-67).
Almost all credit was production credit (short-term) and was granted in
kind (mainly improved seeds and fertilizer) by the project unit. About US$
3.0 million were spent on the purchase of imported agricultural inputs,
including improved dairy breeds, of which the Bank financed about US$ 1.7
million equivalent (56%) and the Government of Bolivia the remainder.
About US$ 2.5 million were granted as credit in kind during the 8-1/2 years
of project execution, through 321 subloans to associations, benefitting
about 8,000 individual farmers.   It  appears  that  a large portion of the
difference of US$ 0.5 million between the totals for import purchases and
credit was lost during 1982-85 when inputs were delivered to farmers at
prices well below acquisition cost, in response to heavy pressure from
farmers who claimed that market prices were lower than those being charged
by the Project Unit.
Beneficiaries
29.      Eight  thousand  families,   or   twice  the  appraisal  estimate,
benefitted from the technical services in two provinces (Ingavi and Aroma).
The increased number of beneficiaries was at the expense of decreasing the
amount of the average short-term subloan per beneficiary (US$166 at
completion as compared with US$246 at appraisal). Five thousand families
(45X of the appraisal estimate) benefitted from the drinking and sanitation
components; most of them also received credit.
Disbursements and Costs
30.      Because of  chronic  lack  of  counterpart  funds  and  the Bank's
obligation to reimburse only against incurred expenditures, the project
suffered delays and was  scaled  down,  resulting  in loan disbursements of
only US$ 6.4 million, US$ 3.1  million being cancelled.  Actual total costs
were estimated at completion to be US$ 8.4 million as compared with USS



- 10 -
12.9 million at appraisal.    Actual  expenditures for expatriate and local
technical services amounted to US$ 4.8 million (or 57X of actual project
costs), while at appraisal it was estimated that such expenditures would
account for only 25% of project costs.
Proiect Outcome
31.      A large part of the  production  benefits were estimated to derive
from the 1,000 ha to be irrigated, a component which was not carried out.
However, rainfed areas which received credit do show some impact; with
inorganic fertilizers, improved land preparation, and improved seeds,
average yields for potatoes (the main staple) have doubled or tripled
(depending on weather conditions) from 3.5t/ha prior to the project, and
oats and barley yields (the main forage crops) have doubled to 3 t1ha.
Because of the mixed cropping practices followed by all farmers, there are
no reliable records of other production components. A visit to the project
area, however, confirmed the importance of alfalfa and oats for livestock
production and the increasing role of dairy cattle. About 960 improved
dairy cattle were introduced and distributed to 200 families. The demand
for dairy cattle in the project area is still very large but constrained by
two factors: scarcity of improved breeds, which often must be brought from
Peru, and lack of  credit.    Farmers  who  have  received credit for dairy
cattle and tractors often have repaid their loans within two years, partly
because the investments were productive, partly because loans could be
repayed  with  devalued  currency.    At  audit  (May  1988),  the economic
situation appeared stationary, with no evidence of continued development.
This may be due in large part to the cessation of technical assistance and
credit in 1988. The issue of sustainability is further discussed in para.
42. The ERR at appraisal was estimated at 15%. Because of the failure of
the irrigation component, the uncertainty regarding sustainable yields on
rainfed crops and the continued lack of an adequate support structure, the
project cannot be considered successful.
B. Ulla Ulla Proiect
32.      Management.     Project  implementation  lasted  almost nine years
compared to an appraisal estimate of  five  years.    As in the case of the
other two projects, implementation was hampered by economic and political
instability, hyper-inflation which made the provision of adequate and
timely counterpart funding illusory, and frequent changes in project
management which in turn had repercussions on senior project staff. The
fact that implementation was entrusted to an agency which was a new
institution  in   the   process   of   being   established,   with  project
responsibilities well beyond the narrow technical scope of this institution
(i.e., the development of a national wool industry) contributed to
implementation problems and delays, as did the extreme isolation of the
project area (the most remote by far of the three projects). As in the
case  of  the  Ingavi  Project,  however,   there  has  been  a  degree  of
institutional stabilization in recent years, and the new management is
looking at the role and possibilities of the institution, and the project's
legacy and future, with a commendable sense of realism.

Achievements by Component
33.      Infrastructure.    Among  the  infrastructure  components realized
under this project, the most  important  ones  in terms of their potential
impact on the project area are new access roads (whicn was also the only
physical component with a target overachieved -- 56 vs 54 km estimated at
appraisal.8/ During the field visit, the mission found circumstantial
evidence that the roads have not only facilitated movement of goods into
and out of the project area (cutting the travel time to La Paz by about
five hours) but are also enabling the population in the area to avail
themselves more easily of temporary employment opportunities outside the
area. However, the physical improvement will need to be complemented by a
corresponding marketing structure for the area's main commodity, wool, in
order to reap fully the intended benefits of this investment.
34.      Next  to  the  roads,  the  other  physical  investments  pale  in
significance, although in the longer run they will also contribute to the
process of social transformation and of integration of the beneficiary
population in the national mainstream.    The school facilities (17 primary
classrooms and one intermediate school) appear to be well used, and the
implementation shortfall was comparatively minor (none at the intermediate
level, about one third for the primary classrooms). One supervision report
claimed that the classrooms were not always established in the places of
greatest demand but rather in response to the political weight of specific
local groups, but such observations are difficult to verify or reject on
the basis of spot observations, and project personnel felt that by and
large the school facilities represented sound investments. It should not
be overlooked, though, that while education will facilitate the out-
movement of people from an overpopulated area (i.e. relative to its
resource base), it may also, over the long run, deprive this region of its
wuost energetic and best qualified people.9/     The provision of new health
facilities (two health posts and five "micro-posts") corresponded to 100%
and 171 of targets respectively, whereas the sewage disposal program
(construction of pit privies) reached only 81 of its planned size. The
shortfalls in meeting the targets of the health and waste disposal
components were a result of the lack of knowledge of the social structure
of Ulla Ulla. The health component was opposed by the traditional healers.
The local customs and traditions were difficult to overcome when trying to
introduce new sanitation practices. Two out of five wool collection posts
were constructed in the project area and one central warehouse near La Paz.
35.      stool Processina.  This component, expected to be the main intended
investment  activity  under  the  project,   was  the  one  with  the  most
disappointing results to date: the establishment of a yarn spinning plant
near La Paz which was to provide the outlet for the increased production of
alpaca and llama fiber in the project area and reverse the flow of
(illegal) export of fiber to Peru which deprived Bolivia of additional
income, public revenue and employment opportunities in the downstream
8/ The figure of 141 km given in the Bank overview preceding the PCR (para.
4) appears to include 85 km of minor upgrading works, in addition to 56
km of new construction.

production process. The plant was to have a processing capacity of 595 t
of finished fiberlyear. Various supervision reports (whose basic findings
appear not to be contcsted by the Government personnel with whom the audit
mission consulted) suggest the following set of shortcomings and potential
problems:10/
(i)   The equipment (total purchase price  of  US$ 5.1 million) had been
bought through international competitive bidding at prices well
above the level prevailing at the time of procurement (1982).11/
While well protected in its original crates and in good physical
condition (a statement which also applies to the situation at the
time of the audit mission in May 1988), it was of course subject
to technical obsolescense;
(ii)   Purchases were apparently based  on badly balanced equipment lists
resulting  in  equipment  bottlenecks   at   some  stages  of  the
production process and in excess capacities at others, because
actual   purchases    deviated    from    the   appraisal   report
specifications. Bringing the entire production facility to an
output level of 595 t/year would require additional equipment
purchases on the order of US$ 1.1 million (in 1986 prices);
(iii)   The Government has prepared a factory  site at the outskirts of La
Paz at the cost of US$ 0.2 million equivalent. Developing the
site for factory readiness would require an additional investment
of US$ 1.5 million equivalent;
(iv)   Even under optimistic  output/cost/price assumptions, the economic
rate of return was not expected to exceed 5%. This assumed a
satisfactory resolution of fiber collection, transportation and
marketing problems, and was based on an implementation schedule
which has already been invalidated oy the passage of time; and
(v)   Given these conditions, the  Bank  recommended  the selling of the
equipment to the private sector rather than completing the
investment. This conclusion was unacceptable to the Government
then and is even more so now, given the reduction of the
equipment's resale value in the intervening years. More serious
for the Government, however, are the negative social and political
implications of such a decision which it feels are of paramount
importance.
36.      Having to make the  choice  between  a  course of action devoid of
economic and financial attraction and a decision with some potentially
damaging political and social consequences is probably the most difficult
legacy of this project.   The  present management of the National Institute
for the Development of Wool (INFOL) is favoring a gradualist approach,
proceeding in stages with the transformation of the raw material (better
grading, cleaning, etc.) before embarking on factory operations proper, to

make sure the necessary collection and transportation arrangements are
firmly in place, and also to put greater emphasis on llama (rather than
alpaca) fibers, recognizing the comparative advantage/disadvantage Bolivia
has vis-a-vis her main competitor  (Peru).    While  this approach is to be
commended for its caution and flexibility, it should be realized that fiber
processing as originally envisaged is unlikely to become a financially
viable  proposition  unless   the   funds   for  the  necessary  additional
investments can be obtained under highly concessionary terms.
37.      For  project  activities   which   did   not  result  in  physical
infrastructure, an outcomes assessment (or even an enumeration of project
results) is much more difficult.   The most important achievement (with one
exception to be dealt with in the next paragraph) seems to have been
improved livestock practices, manifest in better fiber shearing techniques
(with scissors instead of knives, sharpened pieces of sheet metal or glass
shards), parasite control (construction of dips) and, in some cases,
supplemental feeding and attempts at pasture improvement.
38.      If one abandons a narrow financial view, the success of the vicuna
conservation program has to be rated  high.   At the verge of extinction in
the Ulla Ulla area at the beginning of the project, the stock has since
more than tripled to an estimated 2,800 heads. While at the present time
there is no viable technique of exploiting this potentially very valuable
resource 12! short of destroying it (i.e. of killing the animal), the non-
monetary value of conserving this unique animal should not be dismissed out
of hand.
39.      Credit.    Credit  operations  under  this  project  were  minimal
compared with  appraisal  targets.        Only  26  subloans  for  livestock
development and 18 subloans for handicraft development totalling US$ 0.1
million were granted from 1981 to project closing in 1986. It appears that
the main reasons for this low demand for credit were: (a) the failure of
the Agricultural Bank of Bolivia in its contractual obligations to open a
branch office in the project area 13/ and the resulting need for credit
applicants to make a ten hours' journey to La Paz; (b) linked to the first
shortcoming, the absence of a dynamic credit promotion campaign in an area
where most producers did not have any knowledge of institutional credit;
and (c) the opposition of middlemen--the traditional leaders and credit
suppliers.
40.      Since subloans granted during  1981-84  were medium- to long-term,
with grace periods of up to three years, and at highly negative interest
rates, all producers repaid their subloans before or soon after the grace
period had expired, because the hyperinflation prevailing during the
1980-85 period had reduced drastically their real-terms debts. It was only
12/ Because of its superb quality, (illegally obtained) vicuiia fleece
commands prices several times higher than the top alpaca quality.
13/ BAB argued that the small credit volume would not have justified the
rather high fixed expenses (two permanent staff plus operational costs)
of maintaining a field office.   While  this seems a valid argument, it
opens the question of why this point was not considered during the
project design stage.



_ 14 -
in 1986 that interest rates were raised to be positive in real terms.
Outstanding amounts of subloans for livestock developments granted during
1986 are equivalent to USS 0.1 million, and those of subloans granted by
the State Bank for the handicraft development are equivalent to only US$
11,000. Discussions with former project staff suggest that subloans were
granted less on their economic and technical merits than as a result of
local political pressure, and that not seldom the proceeds were used for
purposes different from those envisaged in the original investment plans
prepared by the project unit, which suggests lack of supervision.
41.      Beneficiaries.  Project benefits cannot  be quantified as there is
at present no reliable information on herd sizes, fiber production, or crop
yields.14/ Nor are there satisfactory  estimates  of the numbers of project
beneficiaries; they vary greatly according to the specific activity/
component under review, ranging from a handful in the case of the credit
scheme to a substantial portion for the social infrastructure (where most
effects will have a long gestation period), to almost the entire population
if one looks at the benefits of the road or of improved husbandry
practices.
Disbursements and Costs
42.      The PCR provides a global estimate of total project cost of US$ 18
million, or 77% of  appraisal  estimates.   Disbursements totalled US$ 13.5
million of a total loan/credit amount of US$ 18 million. Equipment,
materials,  and  vehicles   accounted   for   US$   6.3  million  (47%)  of
disbursements, project administration/operation absorbed more than US$ 4.7
million (35%), and civil works nearly US$ 1.2 million (9%).
Prolect Outcome
43.      It is probably fair to say that the project has led to a change in
perceptions among the project population (although the mission is aware of
the possibility of response biases in the peasants with whom it had an
occasion to talk), which could be reinforced and amplified by subsequent
education, extension and training activities (inadequate as they may be at
the present time), which together with the basic physical infrastructure
provided under the project and future additions to it, could lead to a
gradual    betterment  of  living  conditions  and  income  levels  in this
distressed area. Whether the same result could have been achieved at a
lower cost, or whether more could have been done under better macroeconomic
circumstances, remains an  unanswered  question.    The  project  has to be
considered unsuccessful because its main productive components were not
implemented.15/
14/ It should be stressed that much of the project area lies at too high an
altitude to permit agriculture, and is even beyond the range of the
llama, so that the alpaca is the basis of the peasants' livelihood.
15/ The EEC stresses thp.t the project's failure to demonstrate a way to
implement such a project and to institutionally support the national
administration is as serious as its failure to achieve its productin-
objectives.

C. Omasuvos-Los Andes
Management
44.      The four-year project (1979-1983) was  closed after seven years in
December 1986.   The  project  unit  was  quickly  established in Achacachi
(province of Omasuyos) and by April 1980 a full complement of staff was in
place. The location of the project unit quickly became a problem which
affected  project   implementation.       The   province   of  Omasuyos  has
traditionally been an area of unrest and a source of social and political
pressures (The appraisal report indicated that the Project Unit should be
located in either Achacachi or Huarina, both in Omasuyos province--para
4.02). Had the project unit been located in the neighboring province of
Los Andes which had tio such tensions, project implementation would have
been less affected by local pressures.    As with the Ingav4 project (para.
24), frequent staff changes in IDRA,  and of directors and key personnel of
the Project Unit prevented any long-term planning throughout project life.
The masuyos-Los Andes project was singularly affected by both the Central
Government instability and by pressures from the local farmers' leaders,
who at times intervened in daily project matters, forced the granting of
credit to certain groups, end prevailed upon the Government to appoint
project directors  of  their  liking.    Because  of  low morale and staff
salaries, at project's closing in 1986 the Project Unit in Achacachi had a
Technical Director and six extension agents, as compared with 18 agents as
designed at appraisal. At audit (1988) only two technical staff remained
in post. The depletion of project staff, however, has benefitted other
rural development schemes in Bolivia, which have hired such qualified staff
under higher pay scales and greater continuity in employment.
Achievements by Component
45.      Extension.  During the  earlier  years,  the technical services of
the project showed some accomplishments.    Of  six housing units, only two
were finished and are used as offices. A warehouse and water supply system
were completed. Other structures (offices and a training center) are in a
semi-finished state and further works have come to a standstill. About
16,000 families were reached by the credit component compared with 2,500
estimated  at  appraisal  (para  48).    Thirty-uight  courses  were  given
concerning on-farm extension which  reached  1,000 males and 600 females.
The project trained 54 female extension agents in a three-year course, of
whom  24  graduated  and worked   in   the  two  provinces  until  project
implementation ended in 1985/86.  This component was successful in reaching
232 men and  2,072 women  in  a program  of  alphabetization.  The female
extension agents also  gave weekly  courses  in  their respective areas on
homemaking, family health, and management  of small plots for horticultural
products. They organized exhibitions of handicraft products made by women,
which were sold during market  days.    About  2,000 women participated in
these weekly courses. Although no records are available for earlier years,
even when the project was winding down in 1985, 212 male and 21 female
farmer/extension workers were still being trained in animal health and, in
1986, 21 courses were given on a broad spectrum of farm practices, reaching
357 women and 269 men.    The  female  extension agents were transferred to
other on-going projects in late 1986.



- 16 -
46.      Forestry.  The  forestry  component  was  a  failure even though a
nursery was established.   About  150,000  plants  were produced before the
nursery was occupied by the laborers, because they had not received their
wages. The nursery functions today as a private enterprise.
47.      Infrastructure.  A new 23  km  good  quality gravel road was built
linking a remote area of the project to the capital Achacachi. By 1986,
only 109 wells and pumps and  132 privies had been constructed, as compared
with  appraisal  targets  of  4,000  and  3,000,  respectively.    Lack  of
acceptance by the population and  supply  shortages account for the drastic
shortfall.
48.      Credit.  Although the management  of the credit component was also
plagued with inadequate institutional and administrative arrangements, some
of the production objectives were met (PCR, paras. 3.02-3.11). As in the
case of the Ingavi project, farmers increased the productivity or their
plots by introducing agrochemicals and improved seeds that were furnished
under the credit component. They were also exposed, for the first time, to
institutional credit.    About  16,000  families  organized  in groups have
benefitted from credit in the two  provinces.   All credit was delivered in
kind by the project unit under ad-hoc procedures, which caused difficulties
for adequate control of the  credit  portfolio.    In addition, there was a
poor coordination with BAB (the financial intermediary) for recording
credit operations conducted by the  Project  Unit.    This in turn, made it
difficult to account fully for loan disbursements made by IFAD (the co-
financier) for the credit component. IFAD disbursements as of December 31,
1985 were equivalent to about US$ 2.4 million, while records of the project
unit showed subloan disbursements totalling only US$ 1.9 million. It
appears that the difference of about US$ 0.5 million was in part due to the
fact that the Project Unit was at times persuaded by the project population
to undercharge the value of agricultutal inputs16/ , but also to the
existence of an unused (and unaccounted) stock of agricultural inputs. As
of the same date BAB had recorded subloans for only US$ 1.4 million, which
fell short of IFAD disbursements by about US$ 1.0 million. It appears that
BAB did not record purchases paid directly by IFAD. Accounting records of
BAB and the Project Unit were reconciled during 1986. It is evident that
the role of the entities involved in the credit program differed from the
relevant provisions in the financing agreements.  With the exception of the
agricultural year  1986/87,  all  subloans  were  granted  at negative real
interest rates,  and  no  maintenance  of  value  clauses  were introduced.
Therefore the value of subloan repayments was eroded by the hyperinflation
experienced during 1980-85.   At  present  there  are about US$ 0.4 million
worth of subloans outstanding.    It  seems  that  farmers are unwilling to
repay their outstanding balances unless the credit program is reactivated.
Beneficiaries
49.      Nine thousand families  were  reached  by  the credit component in
Omasuyos province and seven  thousand  in  Los  Andes.   The new road links
several communities with no previous access to Achacachi, thus serving a
substantial population.    Over  2,000  persons  have  benefitted  from the
women's programs, 3,200 from the drinking water component (wells and pumps)
16/ See para. 28 above for the similar experience with the Ingavi project.

and 1,200 from the  construction  of  privies.   An additional 10,000 urban
families are connected to a municipal watertank constructed in Achacachi,
originally not included in the project.
Disbursements and Costs
50.      IDA disbursements amounted to US$  2.1  million (71% of the credit
amount) and US$ 0.9 million was cancelled in July 1987. IDA financed
infrastructure and administrative and technical support (including staff
salaries). IFAD disbursed US$ 2.6 million from its US$ 4 million loan,
mostly for the agricultural  credit  component.    The continued changes in
staff and the unavailability of required inputs, improved seeds and
agrochemicals were constraints for loan disbursements. The PCR estimates
the actual project costs at US$ 5.2 million as compared with an appraisal
estimate of US$ 9.3 million.
Pro iect Outcome
51.      The project did have  some  impact  on farm development but actual
achievements fell short of appraisal  projections.   During the first three
years of the project (1980181-1982183), a substantial number of credit
beneficiaries apparently received adequate technical assistance and were
introduced to the use of inorganic fertilizers and improved seeds. But the
amounts disbursed to each farmer were insufficient and deliveries of inputs
often late. Provision of credit and technical assistance have practically
ceased. Even though the appraisal envisaged an integrated development of
crops and livestock, the climatic conditions of the project areas impose
great uncertainties on  crop  farming.    During appraisal the agricultural
risk factor for crops was clearly underestimated. Not surprisingly farmers
diversify into livestock, mainly dairy cattle and sheep, which are the
major sources of farm income.    The  greatest  efforts of the project were
directed at cropping activities (i.e., short-term credit), while livestock
development (long-term credit) received a low priority. Furthermore, the
political element underlying the granting of credit (PCR, para 3.8) favored
the distribution of inputs used every year over the realization of long-
term investments. Cattle raising has spontaneously increased in the area
over a short period of time although the project did not issue credit for
herd improvement.    Production  and  productivity  increases  in livestock
development were mainly derived from increases in carrying capacity through
the establishment of  improved  pastures.    There  is  a  large demand for
improved Holateins which have adapted well in the area and whose yields are
double and triple those of the local stock (which average only 3
liters/day).
52.      The changes in  cropping  patterns  proposed  at appraisal did not
take place. It was expected that output of foodcrops would be one of the
main objectives of farm development. The area under potatoes increased but
the total food crop area shrunk.    The  cultivation of alfafa and oats has
been spreading but is still constrained b7 the availability of good quality
(imported) seed. The project is considered unsuccessful because only a
fraction of the targets were realized and the interruption of credit and
technical assistance activities make continued progress unlikely.

III. CONCLUSIONS AND MAIN ISSUES
A. Overview
53.      From  the  point   of   view   of   public  productive  activities
(irrigation,   forestry,   research,   extension,   institution   building)
achievements as a whole under *ll three projects fell short of their
targets in virtually every area, and actual achieverents are not yet proven
to be sustainable. The credit and technical assistance components are not
sustainable. By contrast, public social investments (rural roads, health,
education, training of women) showed achievements which while also falling
short of their targets in some instances, were relatively successful and
appear to offer better  prospects  for  sustainability.   From the point of
view of private investments (on-farm inputs and investments supported by
agricultural credit) the achievements fell short of their targets, were
successful and lasted a few years, but in the absence of follow-on support
activities, their sustainability is in doubt.
54.      From the time of preparation,  the three projects suffered from an
insufficient knowledge of the social conditiots in the project areas, and
from  overambitious   expectations   and   inappropriate   design  of  some
componex.cs. During implementation, all three projects failed to manage and
implement the agricultural credit programs correctly and in line with the
appraisal design. These issues are discussed below.
B. Improper Understanding of the Socio-economic Framework of the Proiect
Areas
55.      During project preparation,  inadequate  knowledge  of the project
areas, their socio-economic structure, and the traditions and value systems
of Bolivia's Altiplano population led to an approach for developing the
Altiplano that did not succeed. In particular,. the projects failed to take
into account the alternate use of the various ecological zones by the same
population groups (para. 2 above).    By  limiting  their scope to only one
zone (the Altiplano), the projects constituted an unbalanced intervention
into a well-established cycle of economic activities which was bound to
diminish their chance of success.
56.      The inner structure  of  the  peasant  communities was also little
understood (dispersed clusters of 40-50 families owning land individually
and communally). In general, all three projects were designed by a top
down approach, with little consultation or involvement of the ultimate
beneficiaries. When project populations were consulted or intervened in
project policy or managerial decisions, the leaders of the beneficiaries
intermediaries became the interlocutors but they were not necessarily
speaking on behalf  of  the  entire  rural  population.   Language barriers
between project staff and rural beneficiaries resulted in misunderstandings
or difficulties in transmitting technical or social messages. For example,
lack of knowledge of local customs and traditions made it difficult to
bring about changes in sanitation practices.
57.      Given  the  approval  of  the   three  projects  in  rather  rapid
succession (between February 1976 and June 1979) and their increasing
comp'exity, the Bank and Government apparently did not absorb the lessons
emerging from the frequent implementation shortcomings. Whatever changes



- 19 -
were made in project design and scope resulted from outside pressures-
-political, social or technical.
C. Proiect Desian and Complexitv
58.      The warning in the  Rural  Development  Policy Paper 17/ against a
design that is too ambitious and complex, requires exceptional leadership,
and cannot always be supported on a sustained basis has proved true in all
three projects.
59.      The outcome of these  projects  also suggests that Bank procedures
and processes were not able to handle their particular needs. 18/ Relevant
sociological studies were inadequate  or  non-existent.   None of the three
appraisal teams included a rural sociologist or social anthropologist. Not
until July 1981 (and after all three projects were approved) did the Bank
hire a consultant to study the socio-economic structure of the Ulla Ulla
area.    Even  though  the  resulting  report  was  considered of excellent
quality by the Government and  the  Bank,  daily work pressures and lack of
flexibility  in   implementation   resulted   in   the  report's  practical
recommendations being largely ignored.
60.      Institutional development  has  suffered most  when the projects'
reliance on semi-autonomous project management units has substituted for
line agencies instead of  strengthening  them.    The  project units had an
initial advantage in that they could provide substantive implementation
capability in institutionally weak environments, especially where there was
a sizeable program  of  infrastructure  construction.    But  in the event,
strengthening existing line agencies would have provided some continuity in
project management, now  inexistent.    In  fact,  during  appraisal of the
Ingavi project, the possibility of attaching the project to the Development
Corporation of La Paz or to the National Service for Community Development
was strongly considered but later rejected (para. 9). At present, a new
generation of on-going rural development undertakings financed by major
bilateral agencies in Bolivia tend to locate projects within existing
agencies or attach small coordinating units to an existing agency. So far
the experience with this new type of project appears to be encouraging.
D. Incorrect Implementation of the Credit Scheme
61.      The agricultural  credit  components  of  the  three projects were
expected to constitute a large portion of the corresponding loans/credits.
However, for a country with rapid domestic inflation, the use of subsidized
credit as a major component of agricultural policy, and financially weak
institutional lenders combined to doom these components. In addition, the
17/ Rural Development Sector Policy Paper, World Bank, February 1975, p.
47.
18/ Rural  Development: World   Bank   Experience,   1965-86,  World  Bank
Operations Evaluation Department, April 1988.

role of the entities involved did not conform with either the relevant
provisions in the loanl-redit agreements, or with appraisal expectations.19/
62.      With the exception  of  the  Ingavi  Project during 1977, interest
rates paid by subborrowers were highly negative in real terms. The on-
lending rate for all three projects was 12% in nominal terms compared with
inflation rates of 13.5% in 1978 and 45.4% in 1979, dates by which all
three projects had been  approved  (see  Table  1).   The credit components
assumed increasingly the character of grants, even ignoring the large
numbers  of  arrears   and   non-performing   loans.       In  addition,  the
hyperinflation experienced during 1979-85 eroded almost completely the
value  of  repayments  collected  from  farmers.    BAB  did  not introduce
maintenance of value practices nor  did  the  Bank  insist on them.  In the
Ingavi project, for example,  amounts  outstanding  as of December 31, 1985
(Bolivianos $105.2 million) were equivalent to only US$ 62 but would have
been equivalent to US$ 0.3 million if adequate maintenance of value
practices had been  introduced  in  time.    In Omasuyos-Los Andes project,
amounts outstanding on the same date (Bolivianos $9.8 billion) were
equivalent to US$ 5,800 instead of USS 4.1 million under satisfactory
maintenance of value arrangements.   Therefore, the limited funds collected
from farmers do not constitute an adequate base for continued credit
operations (par&. 65).
63.      A surprising and unusual feature  in the credit components is that
the financial risk (i.e. losses from non-performing loans) was borne fully
and directly by Szlivia's Central Bank, a project feature which was not
foreseen in the appraisal report.   This  affected the projects from  their
beginning. The role of BAB envisaged in the Loan/Credit Agreements as that
of a cashier for the Central Bank, in charge of disbursing funds and
collecting them on behalf of the Central Bank was reduced to that of a
simple bookkeeper of credit operations as reported by the project units.
Since the financial risk was entirely the Central Bank's (collections made
by BAB were passed on to the Central Bank with no responsibility or risk
for BAB), and the interest rate spread assigned to BAB insufficient to
cover its overhead expenses, BAB had no incentives to play a more active
role (e.g., open branch offices in the project areas). In addition, BAB
did not feel compelled to increase collection rates because it did not bear
the financial risk.
64.      The roles of the  entities  involved  in the credit components did
not accord with the original design.   The three Project Units were new and
ill-prepared to manage credit operations, which demanded a great deal of
staff  and  overhead  expenditures   for   organizing  farmers'  groups  or
associations,  preparing  subloan   applications,  purchasing  agricultural
inputs and delivering it as credit in kind, and making loan collections on
behalf of BAB. Such work should be entrusted to financial entities with
experience  in   credit   operations   and   with   adequate  physical  and
administrative  structures.       Weaknesses   identified   in  a  financial
intermediary  (such  as   BAB),   should   be  countered  by  institutional
191 The Government of Bolivia states that alt exception to this rule is both
the Bank staff responsible for the projects and the Bolivian directors
who, it might be argued, showed an important degree of inflexibility
and orthodoxy.

development efforts  rather  than  by  shifting  responsibilies  to  a non-
specialized agency.  The  Project  Units  were  not  equipped to be banking
agents and the events proved arrangements to be unsustainable.
65.      Because of the way the credit components were designed and managed
they resulted in three private subsidy elements to beneficiaries arising
from: (a) highly negative interest rates in on-lending, (b) low volumes of
collections from farmers in most cases, and (c) extreme erosion of amounts
collected by inflation.   Similarly,  a  "tax"  was absorbed by Government,
arising from: (a) the exchange rate drop occurring during the time between
project expenditures taking place and the moment of IDA/Bank disbursements,
and (b) the Central Bank holding a credit portfolio with almost no value in
real terms (para. 62).
66.      The  biggest  subsidy  of  the  credit  components,  however,  was
received by the Government and it arises from the existence of an official
and a parallel exchange  rate  system.    As  seen  in  Table 1, a parallel
exchange rate system started in 1982, with exchange rates over twice the
official values. The Project Units purcha_ed fertilizer and agrochemicals
through international competitive bidding (ICB).   Since they had access to
project funds and needed to use the (lower) official rate of exchange, they
could have afforded to price the goods in domestic currency at lower levels
than equivalent goods available in the market place which had to face the
parallel rate, or conversely, the Project Units had marketing margins of
over 1002 of the value of the goods sold. On the other hand, when the Bank
disbursed against credit for expenditures incurred locally, it did so at
t'e official rate of exchange and therefore it disbursed more foreign
currency than was required to purchase the same good at the parallel
exchange rate.20/
67.      Supervision and monitoring of  the  use of credit resources appear
to have been waak, both by Government and Bank staff, which resulted in
failure to take corrective actions in these key components. Supervision
missions seldom included staff specialized in agricultural credit, which
may have contributed to the relative neglect of these activities.
20/ The amount of the subsidy can be measured as the excess over the
expenditures that went into purely developmental activities. Thus,
development expenditure =      (total lending * (official exchange rate)
(shadow or parallel exchange rate)
and resource transfer (subsidy) - (total lending) - (development
expenditure).

Subiect: Audit and Completion Reports
Ulla Ulla Development Project, Bolivia
Loan 1510-BO, Credit 762-BO
1.        We were interested to read the documents provided, namely:
-    "World Bank Project Performance Report," OED, dated
September 8, 1988;
-    "IBRD Overview of FAO/World Bank Cooperation Program:
Project Completion Report."
Please note that we shall very shortly be forwarding you an EEC
ex-post evaluation report on this same Ulla Ulla project.
2.        Your analyses and ours converge: we are in general agreement with
your observations and conclusions.
3.        By now, the reasons for this failure seem obvious and, as far as
concerns the EEC as it was at the time, can be explained by a lack of
experience with Bolivia. Apart from the exceptionally adverse social,
economic and political circumstances prevailing in Bolivia during the period



- 24 -
in question, it appears to us, on the basis of experience of the country
gained since then, that the major weaknesses of the Ulla Ulla project, in
order of importance, were:
(a) Lack of a specific project structure (management), and of foreign
technical assistance that was consistent, decentralized, and
available throughout the life of the project;
(b) The project was too ambitious, both in its diversity (a lack of
focus) and its duration. A four-year project of this type should be
treated, from the outset, as a first phase, which, if successful,
should then immediately be followed by a second phase whose purpose
is consolidation in pursuit of permanent structural impact;
(c) Insufficient knowledge of the sociological characteristics of the
communities in the project area (primary socio-economic data and
preparation for the introduction of extension packages).
4.        However, we would hesitate to agree with some of your conclusions
(cf. World Bank Audit Report):
(a) The opinion expressed regarding ad hoc units vs. line agencies
(cf. "Findings and Lessons," page XVII).
Our recent experience (cf. the rural microprojects program) suggests
that ad hoc units - being decentralized, and therefore more
"operations-oriented" - are a better choice than reliance on line
agencies, even though theoretically involving a higher risk where
sustainability is concerned.
(b) The project fai.ed not only because the goals set for the main
production components were not achieved (cf. para. 43, p. 26);
equally important was the fact that it did not serve as an occasion
for demonstration and institutional support that could have shown
how to conduct a project successfully while involving the relevant
central government department or agency.
5.        Finally, and this is something the EEC is pleased to have had a part
in, the school building program was carried out correctly and the facilities
are in use. In our view, it is here that this project has made a positive
contribution, by sensitizing the young segment of the population, giving it an
awareness of development needs and potential in the area. A point of
departure, if you will .......

Subject: Bolivia - Export Projects Performance Audit Report
Dear Mr. Donaldson:
With reference to your note of October 14, 1988, I am pleased to
send you some preliminary comments on the above-referenced document.
Firstly, I have the impression in general that the document is
fairly cautious and lukewarm about the performance of the projects in
question, concluding that the lessons drawn from them are limited to certain
areas and are all of equal importance.
It can be argued that the lessons that can be drawn from experience
in rural development in Bolivia are as follows:
1.   Implementation and outcomes
(a) The poor understanding of and unfamiliarity with the real situation
in Bolivia which (can be remedied] only with a historical analysis
that covers the socioeconomic, political and cultural processes was
the major shortcoming and weakness in the design and implementation
of the three projects.
(b) If we agree that these projects were "prepared and implemented under
almost the same macroeconomic conditions, sharing the conceptual
basis and being directed at nearly identical populations and
environments," it appears that, as a consequence of (a), the
critical variable is precisely the conceptual basis.
(c) The two foregoing errors apparently resulted in the design of
complex projects and of project units that greatly weakened the
organizational structures of the Ministry of Peasant Affairs and
Agriculture (MACA), and in the poor identification, design and
evaluation of various project components.
2.   Conclusions and maior issues
(a) The total lack of understanding of the'real situation in the country
was again a problem, as the project areas are an integral part of
Bolivia's socioeconomic reality.



- 26 -                            ATTACHMENT II
Page 2 of 2
(b) The unfortunate design and complexity of the projects reflected a
mechanical use of theories and techniques without proper alignment
with the real situation that was to be impacted.
(c) The use agricultural credit as a central component of the projects
and its "incorrect implementation" were due to a conceptual basis
that assumed the development and uniform presence of the market in
Bolivia, such that in the rural area would have an efficient and
homogeneous banking system and infrastructure.
(d) It can be argued that in general there was considerable
inflexibility and orthodoxy among World Bank officials and experts
and project leaders. This thus appears to be an exception to the
rule that "the roles of the entities involved in the credit
components did not accord with the original design."
3.   Lessons learned
From the standpoint of Bolivia and development science, the lessons
to be learned are:
(a) Avotd institutional rigidity and conceptual orthodoxy, giving the
potential "beneficiaries" the benefit of the doubt;
(b) The foregoing should lead to the. rectification of errors which are
not made solely and exclusively in rural development;
(c) The first task is to learn about the day-to-day life of the
beneficiaries, next to organize that knowledge and add to it our
theoretical approaches and techniques and only then to proceed with
project design and implementation;
(d) Immediately put the lessons learned into practice, bearing in mind
that there are others yet to be learned, such that the conclusions
and recommendations are formulated outside the preconceived premises
held by those who design, implement and evaluate the projects.
Yours truly,
Dr. Hugo Romero Bedregal

INGAVI RURAL DEVELOPMENT PROJECT
(Loan 1211-BO)
PROJECT COMPLETION REPORT
I. INTRODUCTION
1.01      Bolivia's economic performance in the late 1960s and early 1970s
was mixed. Private sector investment had been declining while the public
sector continued to provide for most of the employment growth. The sharp
increase in petroleum and mineral prices in 1974 stimulated investment and
consumption; however, this upturn was short-lived. Subsequently both the
mineral and agricultural sectors declined in importance and the country
became more dependent on its petroleum resources. The agricultural sector's
share of the-GDP decreased from 30% in 1962 to 21% in 1974. At the same
time, large commercial agricultural units in the lowlands producing crops for
export (sugar, soybeans and cotton) were expanding. Smallholder farmers of
the altiplano and intermediate valleys, who make up 85% of the farm
population, were affected very little by the changes in the general economy
or the agricultural sector.
1.02      The majority of the altiplano farmers live at the subsistence
level. The area is noted for its harsh climatic conditions (cold, dry, with
frequent freezing temperatures and hailstorms) and low agricultural poten-
tial. These farmers use primitive agricultural tools and agronomic
practices. They have received very little in the way of production support
services (credit, extension and research). Furthermore, they are isolated by
language, and somewhat by preference from the mainstream of the Bolivian
society and economy.
1.03      In the mid-70's the Government recognized that the social and agri-
cultural production conditions on the altiplano had to be improved and began
making an effort to channel more financial and technological resources to the
area.  Integrated rural development became the focus of the Governments' pro-
gram to increase prodection and income of the altiplano population; the Bank
and other international and bilateral agencies supported this program. The
program provided for integrated and balanced social and economic develop-
ment.  This was the first Bank financed project for agricultural or rural
development specifically for the altiplano region.

II. PROJECT FORMULATION
Identification, Preparation and Appraisal
2.01      The Ingavi Rural Development Project was identifLed as the outcome
of two other projects undertaken on the altiplano: (a) the Bank-financed
Livestock Credit Project (Credit 261-BO) which earmarked part of the
livestock credit for the altiplano; and (b) the UNDP Groundwater Survey of
the northern and central altiplano, which indicated the availability of
ground water for irrigation.
2.02      The project was prepared by the Food and Agricultural Organization
Cooperative Program following missions in October.1973 and November 1974. A
Bank mission appraised the project in May 1975. The principal recommen-
dations of the appraisal mission were that: (a) a study be carried out for
the proposed 20 irrigation wells and that the study be reviewed by the Bank
before the construction of the wells and purchase of equipment; (b) the
beneficiaries would pay 100% of the investment and operating costs of produc-
tion facilities; (c) beneficiaries would contribute labor for the construc-
tion of roads, health and sanitation facilities, and 5X of the cash cost of
wells for household water supply (operating cost would be paid by the benefi-
ciaries); (d) the Government would provide funds to maintain the project unit
for 10 years or five years after project completion; (e) BAB would establish
an office in Viacha for disbursement of funds and collection of loans; and
(f) the Government would prepare, within one year of effectiveness, a plan
for development of milk production in the areas of the altiplano norte.
2.03      The main issues discussed at the decision meeting held in June 1975
were: (a) consultants would be required-it was recognized that the Govern-
ment would be reluctant to finance consultants out of the proceeds of the
loan therefore an attempt would be made to obtain UNDP finance for consult-
ants; (b) coordination of the several executing agencies would be critical to
the success of the project-it was agreed that a central coordinating agency
would be desirable but that the Bank should not require the establishment of
a new agency; (c) the Government proposed, and the appraisal agreed, to
establish a PU to implement the project-it was suggested that the project
could possibly be administered by one of the existing agencies; (d) the
Government proposed to provide finance for Bolivian Electric Power (BEP) to
construct transmission lines to provide energy to power the irrigation wells
-it was indicated that as this may not be acceptable to BEP, an alternative
source of power should be considered; (e) the project was to provide wells to
supply 8,000 families with potable water; however, the appraisal mission
recommended that the project should focus more on production-it was
explained that provision of water was consistent with Bank's Village Water
Supply paper; (f) the mission recommended that the interest rates for
subloans should be 13% but it was agreed that the current BAB rate of 12% be



- 31 -
applied; and (g) the project carried a high risk because of social and
institutional limitations-however, it was indicated that the soil and
climatic conditions were favorable for the agricultural production proposed,
therefore the Bank should finance the project.
Negotiations and Board Approval
2.04      Negotiations focused on the main issues mentioned in paragraph 2.02
and 2.03. In addition, as the result of UNDP's inability to confirm finance
for provision of consultants, Bank finance for consultants was added. The
hiring of consultants was made a condition of loan effectiveness. An
understanding was reached on all assuraaces and conditions of the loan.
2.05      The Board approved the loan of US$9.5 million on February 17,
1976. The Board welcomed the Bank's willingness to accept a project with a
high risk. The high investment per beneficiary was questioned, but it was
explained that while the investment was high for the beneficiaries of
irrigation, it was relatively low for other beneficiaries. Concerns were
raised about the feasibility of forming farmer production groups, but at the
same time, satisfaction was indicated that these groups would not be formal
cooperatives.
Project Objectives and Description
2.06      The principal objectives of the project were to: (a) increase
agricultural production and the income of the beneficiaries; (b) improve
health conditions; (c) promote the production group movement to provide for
more efficient operations; (d) increase the food supply for the La Paz
market; and (e) provide the opportunity for the Government to gain experience
and devise a model for development in the altiplano. The project sought to
achieve these objectives by providing:
(a)    for the establishment of a PU to provide improved production
services, and organize farmers groups to facilitate more
efficient production and services;
(b)    medium- and long-term investment credit for livestock,
pastures and farm machinery (including irrigation pumps);
(c)    short-term credit for yield increasing inputs-fertilizers,
chemicals, seeds, and land preparation;
(d)    the construction of 20 deep wells for irrigation and an
electric transmission line to power the pumps;
(e)    construction of 6 health centers, 4,000 wells for potable
water, and sanitation facilities for 3,000 families; and
(f)    construction of 85 km of all weather roads.



- 32 -
2.07      The basic production benefit assumptions were that irrigation,
higher levels of production inputs, and improved agronomic practices would
increase yields and the volume and value of production, thus increasing the
income of the beneficiaries. The economic rate of return was estimated to be
15%.
Project Cost and Financing
2.08      The project cost was estimated to be USS12.86 million (Annex 1).
The Bank loan of US$9.5 million was to finance 74% of project costs;
including US$4.4 million of local costs. The major components financed by
the Bank (Annex 2) were: (a) on-farm investment of US$4.75 million (including
about US$2 million for irrigation); (b) incremental production credit costing
about US$2 million; (c) technical services costing about US$3.25 million; (d)
rural roads costing about US$1 million; (e) health, water and sanitation
facilities costing about US$1.46 million; and (f) power transmission lines
costing about US$0.4 million.
III. PROJECT IMPLEMENTATION
3.01      The loan, which was approved February 2, 1976, became effective
October 7, 1976, after five months delay in finalizing the subsidiary loan
agreement between the Central Bank and the Bolivian Agricultural Bank
providing for administration of the credit component. The Project Unit (PU)
at Viacha was established and became operational in December 1976. A central
coordinating agency (para 2.03 b), Institute for Rural Development of the
Altiplano (IDRA), was established March 1979, as a condition of negotiations
for the Bank and IFAD financed Omasuyos Los Andes Rural Development Project
(Loan 933-BO). IDRA also assumed responsibility for coordinating the Ingavi
project operations. The appraisal assumed a five year implementation period
and the project was to be completed December 31, 1981. Actual implementation
covered eight years and the loan closing date was March 31, 1984.

3.03       On-farm Investments and Production Credit.  The first crop year
(planting October/November and harvest March/April) 1976/77 was used to
organize farmer groups for collective borrowing, and prepare investment
plans. After the initial start-up period, disbursements reached about
US$325,00C  for the crop-year 1978/1979, and increased to about USS500,000 for



- 34 -
the crop-year 1980/1981. Thereafter, disbursements declined rapidly to about
US$80,000 for the crop-year 1982/1983. Total lending for investment and
operating capital was US$2.2 million, 32% of the appraisal estimate
(Annex 2). The decrease in credit disbursements was due to: (a) a shortage
of counterpart funds for credit; (b) inadequate credit management and
operations; (c) failure of the irrigation program; and (d) a shortage of
production inputs and livestock.
3.04      The shortage of counterpart funds for credit resources was due to:
(a) rapidly increasing inflation beginning in 1982 and the Government's
inability to compensate for the substantial need for additional credit funds;
(b) decapitalization of existing credit resources due to highly negative
interest rates; and (c) a high level of subloan arrears (since eliminated by
high inflation).
3.05      The credit component suffered from poor management.  The internal
control system was weak, without adequate control over the delivery of credit
and recuperation of subloans. The accounting control between BAB and the PU
was inadequate. While subloans were to organized groups, responsibility for
repayment was on an individual basis; thus failure of an individual to repay
affected the credit worthiness of the group. Although it would be difficult
to measure, group's peer pressure undoubtedly had a positive effect on repay-
ment. In February 1978 the Government requested that the loan agreement be
amended to provide for lending to individuals; the Bank turned down the
request indicating that loans to individuals would undermine the formation of
groups. However, the Bank did agree that members of groups could obtain
individual loans for special purposes such as tractors and livestock.
Beneficiaries complained of incorrect credit charges and ineffective inputs
(particularly fertilizers). While credit records did not clearly separate
the amounts loaned for investments and production, most subloans were for
livestock, fertilizers, seeds, chemicals and land preparation.
3.06      Deep Well Irrigation.  Deep well irrigation failed under the
priject. Out of a target of 20 wells to irrigate 1,000 ha, only five test
wells were installed and about 100 ha irrigated temporarily during three crop
seasons; all wells were eventually abandoned. The SAR called for 10 wells to
be installed in year two and 10 in year three of the project (after comple-
tion of the irrigation study (para. 2.02).  No evidence of the results of
this study was found during the desk reivew.
3.07      The major problems with irrigation were: (a) due to Lne adverse
climatic and soil conditions of the altiplano, only carefully selected
micro-regions have the proper soil and climatic conditions to obtain an
adequate production response to irrigation; (b) farmers realized that
irrigation was a high risk investment; (c) in theory the proposal to organize
50 farmers into a group to create a 75 ha continguous block for irrigation
was a good one, but in practice it is very difficult to arrange-some wanted
to participate, others did not, those who did not would not let canals cross
their land etc.; (d) in most years natural moisture was adequate duriag the
rainy season while in the dry season it was too cold to grow crops; (e) when
irrigation was used it created a drainage problem; and (f) neither the PU
technicians or the farmers had the capability to maintain the irrigation
system.



- 35 -
3.08      Technical Services.  The appraisal provided for 21 agricultural
technicians to be assigned to the PU to assist in organizing and training
farmers, to provide production technical assistance, and to operate the
credit program. The project area was divided into six zones each with a
chief and supporting staff, including at least one extension worker and one
veterinary assistant. By 1984 there were 23 technicians assigned to the six
zones in the project area; six zone chiefs, eight extension specialists, six
veterinary assistants, and three health specialists.
3.09      Agricultural extension was inadequate to meet the full requirements
of the traditional altiplanu rural population for the following reasons:.
(a) the project beneficiaries were scattered over an area of more than 800
km2 with poor commu.acation facilities; (b) a disproportionate part of the
technicians' time was taken up with non-production activities such as farmer
organization, promotion and operation of the credit program, distribution of
inputs, ant. in 1979 the Ministry of Public Health transferred the responsibi-
lity for construction of wells and privies to the PU; (c) some techietcians
did not have adequate experience and did not receive sufficient on-the-job
training; (d) some technicians did not know the local language; (e) tech-
nicians did not have adequate knowledge and training to understand and deal
with local customs; (f) many beneficiaries were illiterate, requiring special
communication skills and techniques; (g) there were frequent changes in field
staff (particularly during the later years of the project); (h) technical
staff were not provided with adequate incentives; and (i) no particular
technical assistance system or methodology was developed or applied.
3.10      Roads.  After a slow start, 96.5 km of roads were constructed
exceeding the target of 85 km (para. 3.02, table 3.1). Roads were
constructed to a high quality all-weather standard. Due to limited
hydrological data, several culverts did not have adequate capacity and were
washed out. These culverts have not been repaired and probably should be
replaced with bridges. Apart from the culverts, the roads have stood up very
well even though maintenance has been minimal. The maintenance budget is
inadequate. In spite of minor culvert design problems and minimum
maintenance, the road oomponent has made a tnajor contribution to development
of the project area.
3.11      Health Centers.  The six health centers proposed at appraisal were
constructed. There is not enough information available to fully assess the
effectiveness of these centers; however, they have suffered from inadequate
staffing and availability of medical supplies and equipment.
3.12      Potable Water and Sanitation.  Although construction of these
facilities did "ot meet appraisal targets, 1,126 wells and 1,353 privies were
completed benefiting more than 2,000 families (para. 3.02, Table 3.1). Due
to local customs and traditions, some of the wells and privies are not being
used. Because of the scattered nature and large number of these facilities
it is difficult to assess their impact. The benefits of potable water and
sanitary facilities require an in depth evaluation before further programs of
this type are undertaken.
3.13      Electric Power Transmission Lines.  Transmission lines were
required to provide power for the 20 irrigation wells (para. 3.06).



- 36 -
Fortunately, no power transmission lines were constructed and are not needed
because the deep well irrigation program was a failure.
B. Disbursements
3.14      Total disbursements under the project were US$6,432,171 - 68% of
the loan amount. The balance of US$3,067,829 was cancelled (Annex 3).
Disbursements, in relation to the LAC profile for area develcpment projects
in the region, were average or better through .he first five years of
implementation (Annex 3) and declined sharply after year six (1982) as
inflation increased and the economy began to decline. The decreasing
disbursement rate was caused by: (a) abandonment of the irrigation component
in 1981; (b) the decline in credit resources for subloans; (c) the severe
drought in the crop year 1982/83; and (d) the decrease in the availability of
inputs (seeds, fertilizers, chemicals) beginning in 1981 (corresponding to
the declining economic conditions) and becoming progressively worse during
the years 1982-1984.
3.15      The Bank suspended disbursements on all projects in November 1983,
they were resumed in June 1984.
C. Procurement
3.16      Procurement was not a problem under the project because the
majority of components financed by the Bank did not require ICB or LCB
procedures: (a) on-farm investments (except deep wells for irrigation and
tractors) and production inputs were purchased through normal local
procedures; (b) roads and social infrastructure were built by force account;
(c) consultants were hired following Bank procedures; (d) the loan agreement
specified that deep well pump equipment would be purchased in lots of 10
each; however, the test pumps were acquired from the Geological Survey
Department, and as the irrigation system failed, ICB purchase of pumps was
not required; and (e) tractors and vehicles were purclhased one at a time or
in small lots by direct contract and/or LCB. Two localiy assembled
tractors were purchased by direct contract and the borrower was advised by
the Bank that tractors should be purchased in lots of 10 following ICB
procedures; only two additional tractors were purchased following ICB
procedures by the PU; several tractors were purchased under the credit
component.
D. Reports and Auditing
3.17      Satisfactory quarterly progress reports were submitted regularly
throughout the eight-year project period. The first financial statement and
audit report, for the year 1979, was completed in 1981. The PU and the
Controlaria were advised of the deficiencies in the 1979 financial statement
and audit report. The 1980 and 1981 audited financial statements which were
satisfactory, were submitted to the Bank in 1983. The 1982 and 1983
financial statements are now being audited by external auditors.



- 37 -
E. Compliance with Covenants
3.18      There were 23 covenants under the loan agreement, some had an
important bearing on project implementation, some were of relatively minor
importance and some could not be fully complied with due to changing economic
conditions and changes in the project design.
3.19      The principal aspects of non-compliance related to inadequate
budgetary allocations required for an effective level of project operations:
credit, technical services, maintenance, conduct of studies etc. Several
conditions could not be complied with due to the failure of the irrigation
component (paras. 3.06-3.07). The PU was unable to obtain a cash contri-
bution from beneficiaries of wells because many simply did not have the
resources; however, they did provide labor for installation. The loan
agreement required that credit recipients be members of organized farmer
groups. Although compliance was satisfactory, duritig implementation it was
found that this procedure was not always acceptable to some farmers (para.
3.05) who preferred to receive credit on an individual basis. The principal
concern for the future is with the covenant that requires the maintenance of
the PU for 10 years, or five years after the closing date (para. 2.02) of
the project-there is a high probability that the Government will not have
the resources to fully comply. Details regarding specific covenants are
provided in Annex 4.
F. Performance of Consultants
3.20      Appointment of specialists in project administration, groundwater
irrigation, marketing and credit, and sanitary engineering was a condition of
loan effectiveness. In August 1976 the borrower selected the firm of
consultants, KOCKS (which later became GITEC Consult GMBH) for the provision
of consultant services. The contract was approved by the Bank in August 1976
and signed October 1976. Three of the four specialists had already joined
the project by the end of 1976 and the consultant's contract was completed in
1979.
3.21      There were some areas of dispute between the borrower and the
consultants; particularly regarding the performance of the credit
specialist. As frequently happens, some resentment and strained working
relationships developed between local project staff and consultants because
of the very large differential in salaries between the two groups. Some of
the problems with the credit specialist seemed to be related to his inability
to adjust to the altitude and climatic conditions of the project area, which
limited his performance.
3.22      Technical problems with the irrigation component (paras. 3.06-3.07)
reduced the effectiveness of, and the need for, an irrigation consultant.
Had irrigation been designed as an experimental component, the services of a
short-term consultant, on a periodic visit basis probably would have been
sufficient. Furthermore, it is questionable whether the simplistic type of
potable water supply (small bore shallow wells), and sanitary facilities
(outdoor privies) required the services of an international consultant. A
reduction in the man-months of international consultants under the project
could possibly have reduced their conspicuousness and increased their
acceptability.

IV. AGRICULTURAL AND ECONOMIC IMPACT
Agricultus.al Impact
4.01      The agricultural impact was less than estimated in the preparation
and appraisal reports. It was estimated that the cropping pattern would not
change (except in area under irrigation), but yields of the principal
rainfed crops would increase: potatoes from 4 to 7 tons/ha by year four; and
barley and oats for forage would increase from 3 to 4 tons of dry matter.
Cropping intensity was estimated to increase from about 42% to 62%
Annex 5).
4.02      A large part of the production benefits were estimated to come from
the 1,000 ha to be irrigated (Annex 5). Both the cropping pattern and yields
under irrigation were estimated to change significantly in each of the 75 ha
(50 ha irrigated) blocks served by a deep well pimp. Yields of potatoes
would increase from 4 tons/ha to 12 tons by year three; alfalfa would be
grown on 40 ha of the irrigated land yielding 7 tons/ha of dry matter by year
four; 0.5 ha would be used for irrigated vegetable pruduction; and 2,445 ha
would be used for rainfed production of barley yielding 4 tons/ha of dry
matter. The cropping intensity on the 1,500 ha organized for irrigation
would increase from 42% to 107%.
4.03      Production data (provided by the PU) were only available for the
areas benefiting from production credit (Annex 6). Production credit was
provided for a total of about 20,000 ha (Annex 7) during the eight years of
the project; an average of only 2,500 ha/year (8% of the estimated cropped
area). For the areas receiving production credit, the average yield of
potatoes was 6.7 tons /ha (a 1002 increase), but less than the 7 tons average
estimated at appraisal.   The average yield of oats during the project was
3.2 tons, while the yield of barley was only 2.5 tons, as compared to the
appraisal pre-project estimate of 3 tons (actual pre-project was probably
closer to 2 tons/ha) increasing to 4 tons/ha in year three. Barley was
affected by smut which kept yields low, disease resistant varieties were not
and still are not available; in spite of the low yield, farmers continued to
grow barley because it is the preferred forage crop. Cropping intensity
increased from 422 to 50X - substantially less than estimated at appraisal
(para. 4.01 and Annex 5).
4.04      It is estimated that at least 50% of the beneficiaries in the
project area received production input credit for one or more crop seasons.
The majority of the farm families in the project area have benefited from
technical assistance either directly or indirectly (observing their
neighbors, observing field demonstration plots and through farmer field days
and training sessions). The area cropped increased from about 19,500 ha to
27,500 ha during the project period (Annex 6). Thus, even though data are
not available it is reasonable to assume that production, and income are
generally higher throughout the project area than they would have been
without the project. At the same time, production was constrained by a
shortage of inputs, particularly improved seeds, and fertilizers.
4.05      The most negative aspect of the agricultural impact was the failure
of the irrigation program; a key component of the project and important
projected source of increased production and benefits.



- 39 -
4.06      The impact of the project probably could have been improved if four
critical elements had been organized and managed differently under the
project: (a) an adequate supply of new and improved seeds was not available
when the project was appraised or at any time during the project (seed
production could have been included under the project); (b) credit operations
may have been more effective if full responsibility had been given to BAB and
provisions made for strengthening the institution (a BAB office was estab-
lished at Viacha to disburse funds and receive loan payments); (c) the
PU could have provided mo:e effective production technical assistance if it
had not been responsible for credit administration and non-productive
operations; and (d) the general availability of inputs deteriorated as the
project progressed and a satisfactory supply was never arranged. The more
progressive and larger farmers have received satisfactory benefits from the
project while the benefits for the majority of farmers have been marginal. A
summary of production and benefits for credit beneficiaries is indicated in
Annex 6.
4.07      Livestock is the principal source of subsistence and cash income
for the altiplano farmer. Animals provide wool for their clothing and
protein for their diet; and cash income. If cash is needed urgently for any
purpose, including credit payments, the farmer can sell an animal; further-
more, bullocks are still the main source of power for land cultivation. Thus
livestock development, including pasture and forage improvement, have a high
priority and offer one of the best opportunities for increasing production
and income under the harsh soil and climatic conditions of the altiplano.
4.08      Improvement of dairy cattle and milk production was an important
goal of the project. The project initially proposed to improve the herd by
providing high grade Friesian and Brown Swiss bulls to cross-breed with
native cows. Rams were also re be provided to improve the sheep. Due to the
risk of spreading diseases and the time required to make significant improve-
ments in this manner, the Government proposed and the Bank agreed that it
would be necessary to import improved dairy cattle (principally Friesians)
into the area. Thus the PU established a farm to acclimatize animals to the
altitude (4,000 meters) and then sell these animals directly to the farmers.
The project farm also served as a breeding station for producing calves for
re-sale to the local farmers. Initially the operation had problems with the
purchase of diseased and poor quality animals, but this problem has now been
largely overcome.
4*09      About 960 improved dairy cattle (Annex 6) were introduced during
the eight-year project period and were distributed among about 200 families.
Milk production from the improved animals is about 6.5 liters/day (240 day
lactation period) providing a good income to beneficiaries.  Average milk
production was about 3 liters/day (200 day lactation period) prior to the
project.  The project proposed to increase milk production to 8 liters/day
(240 days) over eight years.  The PU also provided veterinary and animal
nutrition technical services to the beneficiaries.  In addition to dairy
animals and rams, the project also financed the purchase of a large number of
draft animals.  Although alfalfa production increased, the project did not
succeed in achieving adequate increases in the production of barley and oats
for roughage (para. 4.03).



- 40 -
4.10      According to data provided by IDRA (Annex 7) the numbers of
livestock increased during the project period. These numbers need to be
reviewed in light of the limited carrying capacity on the altiplano where
numbers have been more important than quality. The overgrazing situation has
existed for decades and increases in numbers would be considered a negative
aspect without a substantial increase in production of forage crops (oats and
barley) and improved pasture.  While 2,500 ha of improved pasture was added
there was little increase in the production of forage crops, and at the same
time, the area available for natural pasture decreased by more than 8,000 ha;
largely offsetting the increase in improved pasture.
4.11      Nevertheless, it can be assumed that livestock production increased
due to improved breeding, veterinary and extension services. A significant
benefit has been and will continue to be achieved from the 960 improved dairy
cattle introduced under the project. Considering the poor conditions for
crop production and the dominance of livestock, improvement of livestock,
pasture and forage probably offers the best opportunity for increasing the
income of altiplano farmers.
4.12      The principal farmer complaints were: (a) that technical assistance
was inadequate; (b) shortages of inputs; (c) the supply of the wrong types of
fertilizers which provided little or no production benefits; and (d) that the
project was being terminated.
Economic Impact
4.13      The economic rate of return (ERR) is estimated to be about 9%
(Annex 8); lower than the appraisal estimate of 15%, but not as low as would
be expected considering achievements under the project. A second comparative
analysis of the project area (8% of the total) that benefited from production
credit resulted in an ERR of 21%. Calculation of the ERR is based on
constant 1976 costs and prices, and includes the investment costs for the
health, potable water and sanitation components. Eliminating the social
component investment costs (less than 8% of total project cost) would only
have a marginal effect on the ERR-seasitivity analysis indicates that a 10%
variation in investment cost would change the ERR by less than 1%.
4.14      The ERR is considered only as notional in view of the limited data
available and distortions that are caused by the hyper-inflation and dual
exchange rates during the period 1981-1984. Inflation was so high that costs
of production and value of sales are seriously distorted unless adjustments
are made on a month-by-month basis. Also the official exchange rate was only
a fraction of the free market rate which varied almost daily. These
conditions not or.ly discouraged investments, created shortages of foreign
exchange required for inputs, and reduced benefits; but also distort the
results of financial and economic analyses.

V. INSTITUTIONAL PERFORM,--CE
5.01      During project processing there was some concern about establishing
a special unit (para. 2.03 c) to administer and execute the project,
nevertheless, it was decided to establish a project unit in the project area
at Viacha. A project director was appointed in consultation with the Bank
and the PU became operational in December 1976, two months after loan
effectiveness. A full complement of staff was achieved in 1977. The first
project director was a capable manager and he served for about four years;
thereafter there were several changes in-project managers (some without prior
consultation with the Bank) and operational staff. Changes in directors and
operational staff reduced the efficiency and effectiveness of the PU.
Salaries of staff decreased in real terms with inflation beginning in 1982
reducing the incentive for performance and contributing to staff changes.
5.02      The Institute for Rural Development for the Altiplano (IDRA) was
established in March 1979, as a condition of negotiations for the Omasuyos-
Los Andes Rural Development Project, (Loan 933-BO), to be the coordinating
agency for altiplano rural development, including Ingavi. The establishment
of IDRA improved coordination of project operations among the various
executing agencies and strengthened the relationship between the Ministries
of Agriculture and Finance. Without IDRA, political and financial support of
the Ingavi project probably would have deteriorated even more than it did in
subsequent years; particularly as the economic conditions in the country
declined. While IDRA's performance was considered satisfactory, it suffered
from the same frequent changes in directors and operational staff, low
salaries and lack of incentives as the PU.
5.03      The PU operated an M&E unit (three staff) primarily for the purpose
of maintaining production data of credit beneficiaries. The M&E unit did not
collect sufficient production data, or analyze the agricultural and economic
impact of the project. Furthermore, with scattered nature of operations, it
was difficult to collect data on a regular basis. The PU did not prepare a
PCR and data available was essentially limited to the credit beneficiaries.
Thus, the data base was inadequate to carry out a realiable economic and
agricultural impact analysis.
VI. BANK PERFORMANCE
6.01      The Bank was correct in supporting the Government's priority and
objective to address poverty conditions on the altiplano and increase
production, income and the standard of living, of rural families in the
region. During the original estimated five-year implementation period some
difficulties were encountered in obtaining adequate project funding and these
problems became very serious during the three-year extension of the project.
The changing economic conditions, high inflation, and shortage of counterpart
funds could not have been predicted at the time of appraisal.



- 42 -
6.02      As with similar rural development projects, the project was
complex, overly ambitious, and did not give sufficient consideration to the
technical as well as social constraints for production. However, it is
important to note that the appraisal recognized this as a high risk project
and suggested that more emphasis be given to production and less emphasis to
social components (particularly potable water).
6.03      The most serious error in judgement in the project design was
including a relatively large deep-well irrigation component without first
having proved its technical, financial and social viability. With the known
state of irrigation experience under the severe soil and climatic conditions
of the altiplano, irrigation should only have been included as an experi-
mental (pilot) public sector financed component. Discussions during the
decision meeting did question the feasibility of organizing contiguous 75 ha
(50 ha to be irrigated) blocks. Even after implementation began (and with
three-years of inconclusive production testing) the supervision mission's
consultants, and project staff were reluctant to accept until 1981 (five
years after project start-up) that irrigation was not viable. In the
meantime, supervision missions continued to press for implementation of the
irrigation facilities, organization of blocks, and construction of the
electric transmission lines. Fortunately the electric transmission lines
were never constructed.
6.04      In light of the altiplano farmers inexperience with agricultural
credit, the target for investment and production lending may have been
over-ambitious. On the other hand, if credit operations had been organized
differently perhaps the performance of the credit program and production
impact would have been better. Credit operations were made the responsi-
bility of the PU while BAB's responsibility (para. 4.06) was essentially
disbursements and collection of loans. Loans were prepared, appraised and
approved by the PU; PU staff also were involved in distribution of inputs
(credit in kind) and collection of payments.
6.05      An alternative would have been to make BAB establish, and fully
staff, a branch bank in the project area with full responsibility for credit
operations. The PU would then have been able to concentrate on technical
advice and assistance to BAB, and provision of production technical
assistance to the project beneficiaries. The PU technicians were so involved
with organization of farmers, promotion and administration of credit, that
they had little time to devote to the extension effort. Furthermore, had the
lending operations been strengthened through the existing lending institu-
tion, BAB, the continuation of the credit operation may have been assured
after the project, with or without the continuation of the PU.
6.06      One of the principal constraints for increasing production was the
shortage of improved varieties and good quality seed; particularl.y for
potatoes and barley. Adequate research and seed multiplication facilities
and resources did not exist for the altiplano at the time of project
preparation, appraisal or throughout the project period.  The shortage of



- 43 -
seeds, the need for improved varieties (particularly smut resistant barley)
was mentioned in reports from time to time. There is no evidence to indicate
that any effort was ever made to solve this critical problem.
6.07      Supervision missions frequently reminded project authorities of the
need to strengthen extension services, but there is no evidence that
consideration was given to divorcing technical assistance from field
administration and establishing a regular extension methodology and system.
6.08      The frequency of missions, mix of staff and resources allocated for
supervision were fully satisfactory. However, there was a tendency to send
specialists (irrigation, roads, health etc.) separate from regular
supervision missions, thus some missions had a narrow focus and objective
rather than dealing with the integrated project problems. Supervision
missions regularly reminded project authorities of the need to provide
adequate funds to carry out the project, the need to ensure continuity of
project staff, and the need to provide incentives to maintain employment of
qualified technicians and stimulate their performance. Supervision missions
carefully monitored procurement and advised the PU on Bank guidelines and
procedures to be followed. The working relationship of Bank staff with the
Government was good.
VII. CONCLUSIONS AND RECOMMENDATIONS
7.01      The project was the first Bank-financed integrated rural
development project in Bolivia and on the altiplano. There was a lack of
experience with complex integrated rural development type projects and a
limited technical, social and economic knowledge, and data base to support
the formulatioir of a project. In view of the current economic crisis and the
uncertainty about the continuation of the Project Unit and production
services (credit and technical assistance) it is reasonable to assume that
most of the impact of the project has already been achieved. Those farmers
who have already adopted improved production practices (principally the more
progressive farmers) can be expected to continue to benefit from that
knowledge and experience. These farmers have become accustomed to using
credit and higher levels of inputs and will continue to do so if credit and
inputs are available. The provision has been made to continue to provide
credit, in the Ingavi area, under the Omasuyos-Los Andes Project
(Cr. 0933-BO), as amended 2/85; however this is only a temporary arrangement
as the closing date (already extended twice) is June 30, 1986.
7.02      The appraisal was correct in pointing out that the project was a
high risk, and although the project was only marginally successful, the Bank
should consider future projects of a different concept and design, for
development of the altiplano. The greatest shortfalls were due to technical
and economic factors beyond the control of Bank and project staff. The PU's



- 44 -
performance was satisfactory within the organizational framework established
under the project, however, if changes had been made in the credit and
technical assistance delivery system, the production and economic impact
might have been much better.  It is unfortunate that so much time and effort
(including consultant services) were lost on the irrigation component. It is
also unfortunate that an effort was not made to increase the supply of
improved seeds. Although production targets (yields and area) were
optimistic the targets could have been achieved in 8 to 10 years (not three
to four as estimated) if adequate credit, technical assistance and inputs had
been available.
7.03      The principal recommendations are! (a) to avoid overly ambitious
and complex project designs; (b) if the technology base is weak, (in this
case research and seed production), they should be strengthened in parallel
or under the project; (c) the technical services should be organized to
concentrate on production; (d) operations such as credit should be the full
responsibility of credit institutions; (e) experimental activities such as
irrigation, if included, should be treated as such rather than as a
production component; (f) non-productive component targets should be more
modest so as not to absorb a disproportionate amount of project staff time
and resources; (g) a first-phase integrated rural development project should
be simple and modest in scope; and (h) more care is required in designing
projects for severe economically depressed areas whose social and cultural
constraints are not fully understood.
7.04      The Bank should continue to support agricultural development of the
altiplano, but future projects should consider simple alternative designs
focusing more on livestock and agriculture production. Although some social
components may be included, the major thrust of those activities would be
better left to specific projects for public health, water supply, sanitation
and education. Alternative institutional arrangements (including the use of
non-government organizations) for such projects also need to be considered in
an effort to reduce administrative cost. More consideration should be given
to using local specialists (hired as consultants to avoid the difficulty in
attracting qualified people under standard civil service terms and conditions
of employment) rather than foreign consultants (para. 3.24). More
consideration should also be given to using short-term foreign consultants to
support local specialist in carrying out selected tasks, rather than
long-term foreign consultants.

ULLA ULLA DEVELOPMENT PROJECT
(Loan 1510-SO, Credit 762-BO)
IBRD Overview of FAO/Vorld Bank Cooperative Program
Proiect Completion Report
Introduction
1.       The Project Completion Report (PCR) on the Ulla Ulla Development
Project was prepared by the FAO/World Bank Cooperative Program which
visited Bolivia June-July 1987. The FAO/CP was asked to prepare the PCR
because the Borrower lacks this capacity. The FAO/CP mission was not able
to prepare a full Completion Report and analysis of the project's
performance because the project implemenuation agency did not keep data on
production, costs, and benefits. Although the PCR tells the story about
the formulation and implementation of the project, taking into account that
crucial data is lacking, it leaves some serious gaps. This overview is
provided to give a fuller picture, and draws on the experience of key staff
who were involved at various stages of the project's implementation.
Summary and Conclusions
2.       In the mid 1970's the Government strategy for agriculture and
rural development emphasi'ad the reduction of the country's dependency on
imported foodstuffs and the alleviation of acute poverty and
underemployment in the Altiplano. The focus for the Altiplano was to be
directed toward integrated rural development projects providing basic
social services, infrastructure, marketing, credit, and extension services
to increase productivity of subsistence agriculture. The Altiplano was,
and still is, the most densely populated region of Bolivia, with limited
resources, a harsh climate and poor soil conditions, and the population, in
the past, had been less receptive to change. This segment of the
population is the poorest in Bolivia, depending almost exclusively on
subsistence agriculture for their livelihood. Consequently, the Government
had modest expectations concerning development efforts in the Altiplano and
recognized the difficulties in bringing about a phased development of the
region. Coupled with the existing difficult conditions was the rapidly
deteriorating economic situation from 1979 onward and political instability
and social unrest (1978-86): These post appraisal developments caused
frequent turnover at the ministerial and project management levels which
made it extremely difficult to carry on with development as was envisaged
at the time of appraisal.
3.       Feasibility studies were prepared by an OAS team in November 1976
and January 1977 with Bank appraisal of the project in March 1977. Board
approval was on January 12, 1978 and Effectiveness was declared on July 6,
1978. The newly created National Institute for the Development of Wool
(INFOL) was responsible for overall project implementation which was to
take 5 years, but in fact actual implementation covered 9 years. For the



- 56 -
handicraft, solar energy, and physical infrastructure components, INFOL
entered into operational agreements with each participating agency. The
FAO/CP report does not provide a final project cost but estimates it to be
in the order of US$18-US$19 million, which is approximately 752 of the
appraisal estimate of US$24 million. The FAO/CP report cites the overall
lack of records resulting in partial information being available. Bank
disbursements were US$13.0 million which is 722 of the appraisal estimate
of US$18 million.
4.       This project was one of a series of investments (Ingavi, Loan
1211-BO; Omasuyos - Los Andes Credit 933-BO) to attack rural poverty by
simultaneously addressing many components of rural development, many of
which were new to Bolivia.  While achievements under the project fell short
of project targets in virtually every aspect (para. 14), the project was
successful in developing the vicuna resources, exceeding targets by 467Z
with an increase in the vicufna 1/ population from about 600 to 2,800.
A'so, grazing practices of viculia were improved and this has led to a
positive environmental impact. Other amaportant achievements, compared with
appraisal targets, are as follows: Road building exceeded the appraisal
target (141 km compared to 54 km). About 27 greenhouses (promoting solar
energy) were constructed (no appraisal targets) and farmers became
interested in horticultural production for home consumption. Five health
centers (of the 30 proposed) were opened in the region and about 2,800
children benefitted annually from the vaccination campaigns. About 100
water pumps were installed (compared to the 1,200 estimated) with 1,000
families benefitting; pit privies were constructed (82 of the 1,000
proposed) and a 10 km cement canal for communal water supply was
constructed. Seventeen solar heated classrooms (632 of appraisal) along
with pit privies and 11 houses for teachers were constructed. An average
of 500 students are enrolled per year. No training centers were
constructed (5 proposed at appraisal), but 10 courses (encompassing such
topics as child care; basic reading, writing and arithmetic skills; and
techniques of handicraft production and marketing) were given with the
participation of about 2,000 women (compared to 3,000 estimated). Credit
to farmers and communities amounted to 202 of appraisal estimate
(US$300,000), however, only 32 of expected producer groups benefitted from
the subloans. Finally, the handicraft program arranged for artisans to
participate in 14 local fairs and about 60 courses were held with the
assistance of 1,500 artisans during the last 5 years of the project. Total
handicraft credit of US$91,300 was only 32 of the appraisal estimate
(18 loans of estimated 770). For the Handicraft Training Program about
51 courses for 1,200 artisans were carried out during the project period.
5.       Less successful were the components of the project dealing with
livestock improvement and establishment of the wool processing facility.
Extension services were inadequate to meet the requirements of alpaca and
llama herders and only 445 alpacas were purchased compared to the appraisal
estimate of 1,500. Horeover, no llamas were purchased; most resedrch
1I The vicufta belongs to the camel family and like the llama and alpaca,
lives at high altitudes on the altiplano of Peru and Bolivia. The
total vicuna population were being reduced drastically because of
indiscriminate killing by poachers for the high-valued fleece. In '968
the vicufla was declared a rare and endangered species.



- 57 -
results were never published; the commercial farm, as part of the livestock
development component, neither served as a demonstration unit nor became a
self-financed enterprise; the projections on how farmers were to develop
farms did not take place; and no work was conducted on the llama dehairing
research. 2/   The construction of a wool collection network, storage
facilities, and a new spinning processing plant with a total annual
capacity of 595 metric tons did not take place. One warehouse facility for
wool storage was constructed. However, the equipment for the processing
plant remains in its original crates and no decision has been taken as to
how to proceed with the plant (paras. 15,16). On the positive side, the 15
ant4parasite dips were extensively used by the producers and new shearing
techniques were introduced and accepted by the producers. INFOL claims
that 4,300 herders benefitted from this component during 8 years.
6.       Notwithstanding the inability to meet many of the targets and
objectives proposed at appraisal, the project did play a role, as part of a
broad strategy 3/ to accelerate rural development in the Altiplano, in
bringing about some economic and social improvements to one of the most
impoverished segments of Bolivia's population. The goals set were
ambitious, especially as far as institutional (INFOL) capacity is
concerned, but there have been some important achievements. For example,
the passive solar energy technology for the new school facilities provided
free heating for the children enabling them to sit in the classrooms for
the first time in this area, without experiencing the extreme cold which
discouraged many of them from attending school. This positive experience
led families to apply simple solar energy techniques to their homes, such
as double windows. Another spin-off from the solar component was the
simply-designed, low cost greenhouses near the schools and on farmers'
plots. For the first time, farmers were able to grow their own vegetables
saving much money and time. However, due to lack of data it is impossible
to make a fair assessment of what actually happened on the productive side
of the project.
7.       The FAO/CP report does not provide an economic rate of return, nor
were we able to compute it from our own data. The lack of basic
information on physical output, prices, farm development results, total
project cost or cost by component, as cited by the FAO/CP mission, make it
impossible to evaluate the agricultural and economic impact of the project.
The FAO/CP team also indicate that the production impact of the project can
be speculated to be very small because all the productive components
(livestock development, handicraft promotion, and wool processing) did not
function properly and were well below appraisal targets. The most
noticeable impact probably came from the improvements in shearing
technology and disease control.
2/ Results of llama fiber samples processed in Europe indicated it might
not be advantageous to aim for 10O  dehairing and that a good quality
at 702 could be provided and fashion trends were, in fact, favoring
partly dehaired cloth. In view of the changes in market demand and
equipment selected for the textile mill, no further action on this
component was proposed.
31 Consisting of the Ingavi Project (Loan 1211-BO) completed 1984, Ulla
Ulla Project (Loan 1510-BO/Cr. 762-BO) completed 1986 and the Omasuyos-
Los Andes Project (Cr. 933-BO) completed 1986.

8.       The political instability (with frequent changes in senior staff)
and the worsening economy made it extremely difficult to fully comply with
the 10 major covenants under the loan/credit agreement, which covered two
main areas; first, INFOL failed to establish a pricing policy for fiber and
yarn and to create a stabilization fund. However, since operation of the
new yarn processing plant did not take place, creation of a stabilization
fund was not applicable. Second, BAB's failure to establish a branch
office in Ulla Ulla resulted in project beneficiaries travelling to La Paz
(a 5 hour trip) to submit credit applications.
Government and Institutional Performance
9.       The institutional deficiencies weres limited promotion by BAB for
the credit program (a dynamic credit promotion campaign was essential since
most producers in the area did not have any knowledge of institutional
credit); a lack of coordination by INFOL, FOMO, and INBOPIA, for the
handicraft program; and limited promotion of artisans' organizations and
marketing by INBOPIA for the handicraft program. INFOL was created for the
implementation of the project: an independent institution to revitalize and
regulate the growth of the wool textile industry. It was expected, at
appraisal, that the project would have substantial impact on institution
building and INFOL would, in fact, be strengthened under the project. The
question is raised as to the extent of this impact. The Government of
Bolivia moved boldly to establish INFOL. The first two years were spent
setting up the organization and, at the same time, INFOL began, with some
success, to implement the components of the project. The deteriorating
economic situation and political instability clearly had adverse impact on
INFOL's effectiveness in subsequent years. INFOL's performance was way
below appraisal expectations: administrative procedures were cumbersome,
inefficient and costly, as cited by a 1981 supervision mission, in part due
to Governmental bureaucratic procedures. Continuous turnover of technical
staff (due to deteriorating salaries from the inflationary process in
Bolivia) and the Government's cumbersome regulations and procedures further
reduced INFOL's effectiveness. In addition, INFOL's Monitoring and
Evaluation Unit did not function well. The evaluation and monitoring
system was weak and, at times, almost non-existent. For example, the
completion mission cited that it was not possible to determine the
project's impact on livestock production or productivity, or to reconstruct
the flow and magnitude of counterpart funding. The Monitoring and
Evaluation Unit was to have been a vital ingredient for the project but one
that took a backseat to the multitude of other problems arising in the
project.
Bank Performance
10.      At the time of appraisal the importance of close monitoring of the
project, by both the Bank and the Government, was stressed because of the
large number of unique components. In spite of the adverse economic and
political situation in Bolivia during project implementation (and the
resultant Bank suspension of disbursements during July-November 1984 and
April-August 1985), the Bank monitored the project reasonably well with an
average of 2.3 missions per year. Half of these missions visited the Ulla
Ulla Project site, a difficult 5 hour drive from La Paz. However, it is



- 59 -
evident that the composition of the missions did not include the required
mix of skills available for supervising this complex project. In
retrospect, the Bank's internal organization and budgeting arrangements
were not conducive for fielding multidisciplinary teams to supervise this
integrated rural development project. (In this project. there were such
diverse activities as livestock development--alpaca/llama/ vicutla; wool
collection, storage, and processing; development of handicrafts industry;
roads construction; establishment of health and education centers;
establishment of drinking water and waste disposal facilities; technical
assistance for llama fiber dehairing research and solar energy; and
development of women's basic skills).
11.       Of the numerous problems, the Bank devoted a good deal of time
and attention to two important issues during implementation: the approach
for reaching the intended beneficiaries (sociological aspects) of the
project and construction of the yarn processing plant. The Bank's
involvement (and eventual hiring by INFOL) of a sociologist/anthropologist
led to improvements in the coordination of the social components. Less
successful, but not for lack of attention by the Bank, were the attempts to
get the yarn processing plant established. In retrospect, the Bank should
have devoted more time to the education and water supply and waste disposal
components, and made sure that research/extension and livestock experts in
llama/alpaca development visited more frequently the project site. On
several occasions Bank staff recommended terminating the project, due to
lack of progress on the textile processing plant, but because of country
considerations and hopes that the economic situation in Bolivia would
improve, the loan closing date was extended three times (from June 30, 1983
to December 31, 1986).
Performance of Consultants
12.      The Project Agreement provided for the hiring of eight consultants
by INFOL as followst an expert in administration and management to assist
INFOL's general manager in coordinating INFOL's activities and in the
management of the Project; consultants to carry out a llama dehairing
research program; engineering consultants and a textile expert to provide
technical expertise for the operation of the spinning plant, to establish
grading norms and fiber pricing mechanisms; an expert in solar energy to
assist in developing and testing simple and low-cost solar energy devices;
experts in pasture and forage, and in animal breeding and production; for
INBOPIA's handicraft component, an expert in organization and management
and fair organization, and consultants in textile engineering and design;
and an education expert to be seconded to INFOL for the carrying out of the
education component. The appraisal report stressed the importance of this
technical assistance to alleviate some unwarranted risks posed by the
'single package' implementation of inter-related components. Only three
consultants (38Z of SAR estimate) were actually contracted: a textile
expert, solar energy expert, and an education expert. The main reason why
other consultants were not hired appears to be that local regulations were
very rigid and finalization of contracts took a long time resulting in
withdrawal of some candidacies. Also, INFOL not only had to deal with two
ministries (Ministry of Agriculture for production components and Ministry
of Industry and Commerce for the handicrafts component), but had also to
cope with the frequent changes in both ministries. Other reasons, such as



- 60 -
the non-completion of the processing plant, changes in the field research
program and collapse of INBOPIA's handicraft component, coupled with the
frequent staff changes and lack of counterpart funds, all contributed to
the small number of consultants hired.
Issues During Implementation
13.      Influence of Economic and Political Factors: The economic and
political changes in Bolivia heavily influenced project implementation. By
1979-80 the economy had started to deteriorate rapidly forcing the
Government to reduce drastically public spending. In addition, the period
(1978-1986) was characterized by political instability, causing frequent
change of public officials,4/ and social unrest. As the economy started to
decline and inflation grew to levels unprecedented in Latin America (in
1984 it surpassed a 20,0002 p.a. rate), it became increasingly difficult to
obtain counterpart funds and with the political and economic turmoil it
became almost impossible to implement satisfactorily the project (or any
project in the country). Disbursements to Bolivia were suspended in 1984
and 1985. Subsequent supervision missions were, therefore, severely
constrained in what they could do. Supervision missions averaged
1.5 persons and in only about 40S of the supervision missions did the
staffing include a specialty other than that of an agriculturalist.
14.      Shortfall in Targets for Components: Many of the targets projected
at appraisal were not met. But, as discussed previously (paras. 4 and 5)
the main shortfalls were in the livestock components. With regard to the
livestock improvement components, it was particularly difficult to recruit
extensionists and veterinarians fluent in Aymara (the language in Ulla
Ulla), and with practical experience in alpacalllama and pasture
production. The project hoped originally to have exchanges of technicians
and technology in alpaca breeding with Peru (much more advanced in this
area). Unfortunately, the exchanges never took place. Inadequate
information was given to the farmers regarding range improvement, new
forage species, and range management, so many farmers continued with their
traditional ways of grazing animals. Further, because of the lack of funds
and the strong complementarity of some components, failures in some
components led to failures in others. (For instance, the lack of funds led
to failure of the research activities to obtain sound technical
recommendations for new improved pasture varieties and grazing management.
This led to the commercial farming operation's failure to supply improved
breeds for herd development, and in turn led to farmers' lack of interest
to apply for loans.)
15.      With regard to the establishment of a Yarn Processing Plant, a new
processing plant with improved technology and processing facilities and
improved management and organization was urgently needed, since the textile
mills in Bolivia were generally obsolete, poorly maintained, and had
4/ In one year turnover of Ministers for Peasant Affairs and Agriculture
and for Industry, Commerce, and Tourism totalled 15; there were nine
Presidents in office over a five year period; and 7 Project Directora
during implementation of the project.



- 61 -
inadequate processing technology, working methods and management.5/
Increased sales ot artisanal end products had begun to generate a large
demand for yarn by low income groups. However, this demand could not be
met because Bolivia's ptocessing capacity of alpaca wool was estimated to
be only 50? of total production. The textile plant was seen as an
important link in a comprehensive chain of activities covering production,
classification, and processing of raw material as well as production and
marketing of yarn. However, its establishment under the project was
frustrated by overly complex and bureaucratic Government bidding
procedures, plus very large cost increases in the processing plant. By
1984, the cost had risen to about US$10.5 million, more than tripling the
appraisal estimate of US$3.4 million. This increase was largely as a
result of a reported 55? international price increase ir. 1980 for the plant
equipment and the need to purchase unforeseen but essential accessory
equipment (US$3.5 million). The cost overruns were exacerbated by
"startup* implementation delays of about two years.
16.      In retrospect, it seems that the Bank did not act as fast as it
might have in helping to develop alternative approaches to establishment of
the processing plant, in the wake of greatly increased costs. In
retrospect, the Bank should have involved additional people with industrial
expertise (e.g. IFC, Industry Department) to resolve the textile plant
issue. By March 1981, the Bank was aware of the potential 1407 cost
overrun for equipment but it was not until December 1982 that various
alternatives for financing of the equipment and construction of the textile
plant were acted on by the Bank. These included the possibilities of
reallocating funds from other components, obtaining additional funds from
EEC, or the participation of the Bolivian private sector. No decision was
taken until March 1984 when the Bank management decided not to extend the
loan financing of the textile plant and instead encouraged the Government
to sell the equipment already purchased to the private sector.6/   But in
September 1984, the Bank agreed to finance the textile plant, through
reallocation of funds, provided the Government created a mixed enterprise.
(This change in decision was based on country considerations and
indications that recent measures would improve the plant's viability,
provided the Government fulfilled certain conditions). Subsequently,
however, because of inadequate counterpart funding, and inability of the
Government to identify private investors, the plant was never built and the
equipment is still in its original crates. No decision has yet been taken
as to how to proceed with the plant, although it is clear that
establishment of a parastatal should be avoided. There is no question as
to the loss for the country, considering the investment has already been
made in equipment and the comparative advantage Bolivia has in producing
alpaca/llama wool. It was important that Bolivia's processing capacity of
alpaca wool be increased in response to the increased demand for yarn. The
textile plant was to address this need for improved technology and
5/  Findings of consultants' study on behalf of Bolivian Government
1974/75.
61 This was based on the serious doubts as to the capability of INFOL to
operate the plant efficiently; no reply from the Bolivian Government to
the Bank's telex of November 1983, which indicated specific conditions
to be met by the Government; and the Bolivian Government's overvalued
exchange rate and its unwillingness to change it.

processing facilities: it was, in fact, a vital link in a broad chain of
activities. The non-operation of the textile plant has resulted in the
wool buying component not being implemented, and alpaca producers have
reverted to the original system of selling wool through contraband in Peru.
17.      Lack of understandins of the Social Problems of the Altiplano:
Poor knowledge of the socio-economic structure, traditions, and value
systems hindered the implementation of most of the components. The
sociolegical issues below were highlighted by a consultant anthropologist
(hired for the health component) in July 1981. INFOL agreed that part of
the difficulties for introducing improved pastures. breeding of alpaca, and
shearing were due to lack of expertise of INFOL's staff regarding the
social customs and the political power configuration in Ulla Ulla.  This is
a closed community controlled by  vecinos  (commercial middlemen and
political elites).  Before the project they had a monopoly in the wool
market and the introduction of improved market prices and more efficient
marketing channels for wool challenged their authority:  the project was
seen as a threat to their livelihood. INFOL hired the anthropologist to
coordinate the social components and to act as a liaison in the
implementation of the technical assistance and crcdit components.  In fact,
most herders had a sounder knowledge of the local environmental conditions
than technicians. and since only a few extension agents spoke Aymara,
farmers continued with their traditional ways of grazing animals. In the
water supply and waste disposal component also, the lack of knowledge of
local customs and traditions made it difficult to bring about change in
sanitation practices. Similarly, the lack of knowledge of the social
structure of Ulla Ulla, the language barrier, and opposition by the local
traditional healers (vatiris) were critical constraints for the health
component.7/   In retrospect, more attention to the selection and training
of local staff would have led to greater affinity with the local people and
a more effective means to communicate new technology. Inevitably, as the
beneficiaries' expectations rose from the project, they became resentful of
delays in construction and felt that they were due to false promises by
INFOL. INFOL's staff, however, lacked the capacity to deal with these
problems, while at the same time dealing with the complex administrative
and budgetary constraints.
Lessons for the Bank
18.      This integrated rural development project was the product of an
intensified commitment in the mid 1970's to tackle the poverty issues of
the poorest of the poor--and in this instance, in one of the most difficult
sociological and environmental areas of the world. The project did not
live up to all of its expectations and the following lessons are of value
for future ?rojectst
71 An attempt was made to  blend" Aymara medicine with western medicine in
the training for the auxiliaries. Unfortunately, the Secretaria de
Salud of La Paz was not prepared to continue such efforts since there
were no social scientists or anthropologists who shared the view of
'blending' Aymara medicine with western medicine.



- 63 -
jProect Design
Lesson:  Intensive efforts are reeded to design projects, particularly of
the complexity of Ulla Ulla, in accordance with local implementation
capability and, if local knowledge is uncertain, consideration should be
given to doing a pilot project first. Any large gaps that may exist in the
local implementation capability should not be expected to be filled by
technical assistance. (In the case of the Ulla Ulla project, it was
designed to solve too many problems which overloaded Bolivia's capacity for
effective implementation. In addition, the complexity and scale of the
project was not consistent with the knowledge of the project area and its
people.)
Implementation
Lesson: Some explicit ranking of components by priority and phasing their
introduction at the outset would be beneficial. This would improve the
process of technology transfer and lead to a better understanding and more
realistic expectations by the beneficiaries of the project. (Under the
project, a wide variety of activities were started simultaneously which,
apart from stretching INFOL's capacity, caused confusion about the project
among the herders. At the same time, since herders were not involved in
the design of the project, nor had time to absorb the benefits of
technology before being confronted with other technology improvements, they
were reluctant to invest their time and money in the new technology at the
pace expected under the project.)
Lesson: The mechanism of the mil-term review has proved particularly
useful in other p.'ojects, and it would have greatly helped focus attention
on the seriousness of the issues facing this project, if it had been built
into the project. In the event, no formal review was planned.
Lesson: The achievements and problems of the project reinforce the lesson
that development is a very long-term process, particularly when dealing
with the level of technology existing in areas such as the Altiplano of
Bolivia. Expectations set by project objectives should be modest and
should be explicit as to what can reasonably be expected to be achieved in
any normal five to seven year project period. In the same context, Bank
involvement in the development of such areas must be planned to include a
continuing involvement in the are& for the duration of several projects, at
least if lasting improvements are to be achieved.

1. tNTROOUCTt0N
the Bolivian economy during the  1910  decade  experienced  a  high
degree of expansion. when the annual averago real growth of GDP grew at 5.41
between 1970 and 1918 as a result of favourable world  prices  of  its  main
exports  -  oil  and  tin - and heavy borrowing in the international capital
markets. Foreign debt increased from a moderate USS$00 million  in  1S70  to
USS2.400  million in 1960.  Thv twu factors combined - exports and borrowing
- brought about high savings and investment  ratios.   The  foreign  lending
permitted a rapid growth in impurts. as well as an excess of imports over
exports.
1.2      Net foreign lending ended suddenly ir 1979-80, as it became obvious
that not only had Bolivia's foreign debt become excessive, but that a large
proportion of the borrowed capital had been used for projects of doubtful
value or for capital flight.
1.3      During  1979-80  the ecuiumy started to deteriorate rapidly, and it
embarked on a downword spiral of falling  investment,  savLngs.  consu-igtion
and  GOP.   Inflation grew to levels unprecedented in Latin America (in 1964
it surpassed a 20.0001Zannum rate). the  public  deficit  widened,  and  the
Baolvian Peso depreciateu frum Sb20.40 to the US dollar in 1979 to over
Sbl.900.000  in  1986.  The   Government's   efforts   to   counteract   the
deterioration  became tutile.  The interlocking nature of the system was not
fully graspod. and attempts were made to deal with the variables  one  at  a
time.
1.4      The  1978-02 period was also characterized by political instability
and social unrest.  There were nine presidents in office over  a  five  year
perzod. This only exacerboted the overall economic deterioration because of
the sudden  drifts  in  policies,   tho  continuous  strikes  and  political
agitation did not help matteas vither.
1.5      Since  the  beginning  of  1965 the new government of President Paz
Estensoro is implementing a new economic policy which so far has made
remarkable progress in controlling inflation and is beginning to establish
order in the ecorumy.
1.6      The smallholders of the Altiplano amid  intermediate  valleys  Which
comprise about $01 of the country's farming population, were possibly less
affected by the changes occuatiam9 in t'e  economy  in  general,  than  other
sectors  of  the population because the ma3ority of them have not boen fully
integrated into the mainstream Ut thw nation's economy. Host of them live
at subsistence levels.
I.?      The  Altiplano is the most densely populated region of Bolivia. and
about 451 of the country's inhabitants live thore.  The area  is  noted  for
its tough climate caused by its altitude which varies from 4,000 to 5.000
metres, a sparse rainfall (400-500 mmiannum). frequent feooing temperatures.
regul3rly occurring hail storms and uftwn prolonged dry spells. Consequently
its agricultural potential is low.
1. 0     The tectnology uswu by time Altiplano's smaliholders  is  pramitive.
Only  a  few  are startxng to use technical inputs.  Production alternatives
are limited.   The  main  csuis  arw  potatoes,  oats,  barley  and  quinua.
Livestock  (bovine,  sheep, llama and aloaca) plays an important role in the
farmers  income.  By agid j.&    the Altiplano's 'minifundistas' have received

been an impediment to Integrate tho Altiplano rural inhabitant into the
Bolivian soiesty.
1.9      Since the mid 19?0 * the Government, with the assistance of bi- and
multilateral agencies, started to channel increased financial and technical
resources to the Altiplano. and emphasis was given to integrated rural
development projects. the Sank strongly supported this effort through three
pro3ects:   Ingavi.  Omasuyos - Los Andes and Ulla Ulla which were conceived
as integrated and balanced social and economie development schemos.

It. PROJECT FORMULATtON
IdontLfication, Preparation and Appraisal
2.1      The  Ulla  Ulls  Oevelopment  Project  was  identified  within  the
previous mentioned policy framework of bringing about changes in the
backward areas of the Altiplano. The Ulla Ulla region is characterized by
its widespreod povorty and is located in an isolated part of the north-
eastern Alt&Plano.
2.2      The feasibility studies for the pro3ect wore  proparod  by  an  OAS
team and submitted to thO Sank in Novomber 1916 and January 19?. A Bank
team appraised the Pro3ect during March 1917
2.3      Tho main recommindations of  the  aspraisal  mission  were:   a)  a
commercial farm would be established on land contributed by the communitios,
and the profits of the farm would be shared  by  the  communities;   b)  the
Governm.nt would initiate negotiations for the purchase of appropriate llama
fibre dehairLng technology and submit a proposal for Bank/IA consideration
during  the  first  year  of  the  pro3ect;   c)  a  revolving fund would be
establishOd within the regular credit programme for on-farm investment
and/or short term credit; dl INFOL's managor and ASI's (Agricultural and
Infrastructure Oivision of INFOL) chief would bO nominated. subject to
IDASBonk approval; el a pricing mechanism for the purchase of wool would be
established with Provious IOA/Bank approval; f) INFOL would estabLish an ad
hoc development committee in the pro3ect area, where representatives of
pro3ect farmers, including women, would be represented, and this committee
would function at an advisory level on matters relating to the programmes
undertaken by the pro3ect; 9g INFOL would establish a project Monitoring
Unit which would Prepare quarterly progress reports; hi the handicraft
component of the pro3ect would be implemented by INOOPIA (National Instituto
for Handacrafts and Small Industry), but training would be carried out by
FOMO (National Manpower Oevolopment Services), and credit would be issuod by
tho State Bank (BE); i) maintenance of roads would be carried out by SNC
(National Road Services) durlng  and  aftor  tho  project  period;   j)  tho
Government  would  provide  the  necessary  staff  to  maintain  health  and
educational  facilitLos  after  the  pro3ect  completion  period;   ki   OAS
(Agricultural  Bank  of Bolivia) would establish an office at Ulls Ulla, but
INFOL would provide the sub-loans to pro3oct beneficiaries according to form
investment  plans  prepared by A$I.   BAB would be the disbursing agency and
AST would collect the sub-loans which would be used in the aforementioned
revolving fund (see recommendation 'c'.
2.4      The  main  issues  discussed  at the decision mooting held in April
19?? were: a) since there was absence of an adequate institution to promote
the dovelopment of the wool industry it became necessary to recommend the
establishment of a new  organization  under  the  namo  of  INFOL;   b)  The
documentation necessary to provido 4.000 ha needed for the establishment of
an oxperimental station and the commercial farm, should be a condition for
loan  negotiation:   ci the 3.000 alpacas needed for the research, extension
and production programme should preferably be purchased in Peru, but since
there is a law in that country prohibiting thO export of live animals a
specific proposal should be Presented by INFOL and which should be made a
condition for disbursoment; di solar energy, which has a high potontial in
the Altiplano - there are about 2.500 sun hours per annum - should be
supportod by the pro3ect through the purchase of equipment, consultant
services and scholarships; el with the proposed processing capacity of the



- 70 -
plnt to be financed by thz prolect 1300 m.t.) there would be no further
need for additional processing capacity *n Bolivia. tnus it was reccmmended-
that the Government freero the processing capacity until such time as the-
raw mat4r%il-suPPlY increased substantially;  fl in order to  avert  illegal
flow of raw alpaca wool to Peru. where prices were about 251 higher than in
Bolivia. the guaranteed prices to be set by INFOL should be in line with the
Peruvian  prices;   9I  the  doheiring  processing  of  llama  raw  material
technology remains a  trade becret  of specializod firms  in  both  USA  and
Europe.   It was not clear what the cost of purchasing such technology would
be. In view of this the mission recomended that the project should
allocate funds for the dovelopent of the necessary dehairing toechnology
eithor by contracting a specialized research org:i.ization or by undertaking
a  research  pre9grammo  in  BOlivis.   Should  the  government  successfully
nogotiate the ',urchase of an appropriate technology. then costs in excess of
allocations  would be assumed by the government;  h) the mission recommended
that the Bank/IDA finance USS13 million, equivalent to 751 of the total
project  cost.   This would covor 100I   of the foreign exchange costs and 591
of local costs. It was also reconinended that external lenders could finance
part of the loCal costs of governments contribution in view of the
country s poverty.
NeaotiLtions and Board Aooroval
2.5      The negotiations between the Government of  Bolvia  and  the  Bank
centred   around   the   basic   issues  mentioned  in  paragraph  2.4.   An
understanding was reached on all assurances and conditions of the loan and
of the Credit.
2.6      Tho Board approved both operations on 16 January 1978.  Although no
specific mention was made that the Ulla Ulla Development Project would be a
high  risk  operation,  concern  was  expressed  about  the  possibility  of
establishing   in   the   short   term   an   effective   multi-disciplinary
organizational  structure  cutting  across institutional lines.  It was also
pointod out that attractive remunoration would be necessary to hire highly
qualified  staff.  and  thus  reducing  the  apparent risk of implementation
delays from occurring.
Praipet Ob,ectivy and Dserintion
2.?      The pro3ect was to provide financing for a comprehensive integrated
development  of  tho Ulls Ulla area.  The principal objectives were:  (a) to
promote an orderly development of the alpacalilama  agro-industry:   (b)  to
tonserve  and develop the vicuna resources;  (Cl  to improve the economic *na
social conditions of about 3.000 families in the project area;  and  (di  to
benefit about 3,400 rural families in the developmant of wool-using
handicraft act&vities.  These ob3ectiv.s were intended to be achieved by:
i  the  establishment  of  a  P.U.  to  be  responsible  for   project
implementation,   by   providing   preparation  and  monitoring  of
investment programmes, promote credit among farmers and extension
services;
xi) the establishment of an experimental station and research programme
to improve development of alpaca and llama breeds and strengthen
the conservation programme for vicunas;
iii) the establishment of a commercial demonstration farm operating with
about 1,500 alpacas and 370 llamas:



- 71 -
iv) provide modium and long-term credit for investment and herd
development;
v) strengthening the Ulls Ulla reserve for vicufa conservation;
vi) ConstruCtion of a wool Collection network, storago facilities and a
now spanning processing plant wath A total annual capacity of 595
motric tons;
via) provide medium-term loans and tochnical assistance for handicraft
activities;
viii) construction and improvement of about 54 km of all-weather roads in
tho pro3ect area;
ixi establishment of a health facilities network and a modieal post;
x) construction and installation of about 1,200 pumps and 1,000 pit
privies.
Xi) construction of 25 new classrooms and houses for teachers;
xii) improvo health, nutrition and home care practices of about 2.000
women living in thev pru2wct area; construction of five Mothers
Club Contres;
xiiil strengthen   local   facilities  and  expertiso  for  solar  energy
development, providing equLpment, tools and technical assistance.
2.8      Under  the  pro3ect. alpaca and llama production wore to benefit by
increasing and improving the brood base, quality of animal bred, range and
herd management practices, and improving dehairing. marketing and processing
systems.
Prp,.ett Cot *nd finaneina
2.9      The total pro3ect cost at  appraisal  was  estimated  to  bo  USS24
million. The IOA-Bank loan of US$16 million was to finance 15t of pro3oct
costs.  The  ma3or  components  to  be  financed  by  the  Bank  were:   (a)
production investment for US$6.5 million; lb) productive support for about
US$4.1 million:  tc) social  intrastructuro  of  USS1.0  million;   and  (d)
administration and technical services for about USS1.3 million.

tt1. PROJECT I"PLENENrATION
3.1      The loan was approved on 12 January 1297  and became effective on 31
July 1976. The newly created National Institute for the Development of Wool
JINFOL). was responsible for project iuplementation as an autonomous state
institute under the auspices of the Ministries of Peasant Affairs and
Agriculture,  and  Commorce  and  tndustry.   At   appraisal   a   fivo-year
implementation period was contemplated and the project was to be completed
by 30 July 1983. Actual implementation covered nine years and the closing
date was 31 December 196.
A    Aerevments bv CnmDOt
3.2      Detailed  achi9evments  by  main  components  and  by categories of
expenditure are summarized in tables t and 2. Table I shows only appraisal
targets and achievement in units by component.
3.3      Research  and Extension Comoonent.  Herders contributed land to the
Experimental Station. Office spaco for administrative and research staff.
four living quarters, arid a housing facil ty for guests, were constructed.
Laboratory equipment, however, was not purchased. During the first years
pasture research was cunducted but the results were inconclusive partially
because most alpacas were not able to bo kept alive. About 20 kilometres of
fencing  were  installed  and  445  alpacas purchased, from the 1.500 of the
appraisal targot. No llamas wer* ever purChased.
3.4      It seems that most hvrders had a sounder  knowledge  of  the  local
environmental  conditions  than  the  technicLans.   Several  basic research
design mistakes were made and agronomists and veterinarians had little
comnunication  wsth  herders.   The  irrigation system to produce forage and
supply grass seeds to farmers was never constructed.
3.5      Research  concontrated  on  breeding,  shearing  systems,  internal
parasites, feeding and rangw nmanarament. Host research results were never
published.
3.6      The commercial farm did not achieve its objective  to  serve  as  a
demonstration unit, and to become a self-financed enterprLse. About 1.500
ha of communal land were eventually made available after a strong initial
resistance to the project by the local populatLon, but a few months later,
because of social probletis. the land was given back to the community.
3.7      Agricultural and livestock extension was  inadequate  to  meet  the
requirements of alpaca and llama herders. The lack of practical experience
by technicians, and the language barrier, did not permit an effective
communication  between  extension  agents  and  herders.   There  was a poor
knowledge of the existing socio-economic structure and traditions and durxng
the first years this producvd conflicts that led to threats and even
physical attacks on extension agents and a paramedic.   It  seems  that  the
local  politicians,  school  teachers  and  commercial  middlemen influenced
farmers and Communitios to look at the project as a threat to their economic
interests and ownership of tree herds.



- 73 -
3.8      The extension service strongly emphasized training in animal hoalth
and sanitation.. After the inital resaitance herders bacame receptive to the
introduction of preventive control of disoases mainly control of internal
and   external   parasites.    Now   shearing   techniques,  especially  the
introduction of shearing scissors. were the major achiovements. of this
component.    Fifteen  antiparasite  dips  were constructed by the extonsion
service and apparently were extensively used by tho producers. INFOL claims
that 4.300 herders benefitted from this component during S years.
3.9      the  four  proposed  farm models of the appraisal report wero never
developed. Farmers did not reo.vve satisfactory information regarding range
improvement, now forrage species or range management, and continued with
their traditional ways of grazing animals.
3.10     Collection. Storsao and Processing.  The institution that proceeded
INFOL was COMOOFLA. and one of its principal objectives was the purchase of
llma and alpaca wool together with FOTRAMS. an integrated cooperative from
Cochabamba.   Ourxng  the  initial  stages  of tho project there was serious
opposition to INFOL buyers of fibiui  because prices offered wore higher  than
those paid by local middlemen. The lattor convinced farmers that INfOL's
objectives  went  against  the  producers  interests.   INFOL  set  up  five
collection  contres  and  after  tho initial resistance was overcome farmers
began selling fibre to these centres. INFOL was collecting and stockpiling
fibres for future use in the yarn spinning plant, yet to be constructed. As
INFOL was forbidden to export wuul, and the plant had not been built, by the
end of 1982 tNFOL began to run out of funds to pay for its purchasos, and
several times it aid not buy fibre wt.en the  shearing  season  began.   Thus
farmers were forced to sell 2gain the fibre to middlemen at lowor prices.
3.11     After  1984  purcrtises have only boon made for   e operation of the
small PULAYCO plant, about 700 km away from Ulla Ull&. Until 1983 purchases
were  about  90  m  tuns  put  year.  in  1984 about 8 m tons, and 45 m tons
annually for the following two years.
3.12     One warehouse tacility  for  wool  storage  was  constructed.  Some
payment  advancemonts  were  made  for the site purchased for the processing
plant of El Alto. outsiaw La Faz.
3.13     Processing Plant.  The most troublesome aspect  of  the  productive
components of the project is related to the establishment of the yarn
processing plant which during appraisal was costed at  US$3.4  million.   tn
1962 most of the production eguipment was purchased through international
tenders, but by that time prices had escalated to US$5.1 million.   A  1986
Sank  supervision  missiun estimated that an additional USS5.4 million would
bO required for putting the plant into operation, and there were no
counterpart  funds  available  fur  this  substantial  investment.   In  the
moantime the US$5.1 million equipment is still in its original crates and no
decision has been taken as huw to proceed with the plant. Since the
processing plant has root been operational, tho wool buying component came to
a standstill soveral years agu except for the small amounts purchaosed for
tne PULAYCO plant, and alpaca producers revorted to the original marketing
system whereby most of thv wuul is sud through contraband Ln neighbouring
Peru. With the breakdown of the guaranteed marketing and price system,
thore is little or no incentive tu improve alpaca productivity and wool
quality by Ulla Ull herders as was envisaged during appraisal.

3.i       eIN80PlA    The  principal  objective  of  this   agency   was   the
coordination   of   tho   handicraft  programme  and  which  showed  serious
shortcomings.  No technical assistance was provided for marketing  purposes.
Little  importance  was  9ie6n  tu  promoting  artisans  organizsatons.   No
national handicraft catalogue was evor published and nothing was done to
upgrade handicraft quality. INFOL purchased some handicraft articles and set
up a small retail store in La Pat. tt was handed over to INSOPIA but due to
lack  of  funds  it  never  succeeded.   However  INOOPIA holoed artisans to
particioate In 14  local  fairs.   About  60  courses  wore  hold  with  the
assistance of 1.500 artisans during the last 5 years of the project.
3.tS      From information provided by  MNOOPIA. the lack of coordination with
INFOL and FOMO was the must troublesome aspect. and led to the failure of
this component. Continuous changes in management also hindered an agreoment
betweon  INFOL  and  INSOPIA.   Consultants  were  contemplated  but   never
contracted.   Other  complaints  from  INOOPIA  were  that  applications for
disbursements were almost always held back by INFOL.
3.16      Iandicraft Credit.  There was no credit movement  until  1902  when
only about US$16,000 were disbursed. By 1903 the sum had reached US$51.000
and from then on it was reduced drastically to about USS9,000 for the
following years.   Total handicraft credit disbursed came to USS91,300. only
31 of appraisal estimate. for 18 loans out of a 770 estimate.    Eight  loans
went to the rural areas atid ton fur La Paz. Eight of the loans were for
hanoicraft associations and ten for individuals.
3.17      INFOL management complains           the  Banco  del  Estado  I(E).  in
charge of handicraft credit. estab4ished difficult dnmands in terms of
strict requirements for the culaterals. Most of the credit applicants did
not comply with the equity or colateral requiroments established by BE.
3.10      The  Handicrat  Trni nu Programm, was carried out by the National
manpower Training Service (FOM090 and consisted of training courses for
artisans. About 51 courses for around 1.200 artisans were carried out during
the project period. FOMO trainitig emphasized the weavang on looms but the
equioment was removed at the end of the training period and so the new
skills learned became useluss without the looms.  No assistance was provided
for the artisans to organize themselves into associations.
3.19      Credit  to   Fartu.ri  and  Communities.   Credit  activities  were
initiated in 1981. Disbursements came to about USS600000 annually, with the
exception  of  1985  when  no  credit  was  gzven.   Total  amount of credit
disbursed by SAO was about  USS300,000.  201  of  appraisal  estimate.   The
appraisal estimate was for 736 sub-loans, out only 25 producer groups
benefitted from the cvedit. Among the main reasons for the low level of
actxvities  were:    (a)  thO  failure of SAS to open a branch in the project
area which forced producers interested in obtaining a loan to travel 8 to 10
hours to La Paz for applications and other maCters related to their loans:
(b) the absence of a dynamic crredit Promotion campaign in an area where most
producers did not have any knowledge of institutional credit; c) the
opposition of middlemen, tree traditional leaders, to new credit lines;   and
(di the lack of counterpart funds.
3.20      The failure of thw research activities in obtaining sound technical
recommendations for new &mproved pasture varieties and grazing management.
as well as the failure of the cummercial farm oporation to supply imoroved
breeds for herd development, constituted anothor negative aspect to interest
farmers to apply for loanb.

3.21     Vx_una Canservatxan was apparently the most successful component of
the  pro3eCt,   Four  obsurvatiun  posts  were constructed and 8 guards were
trained. equipped and contracted to work at tho Ulla Ulla  reserve.   Vicuna
population expanded spontaneously from about 900 to 26$00 animal units.
3.22     lasI  buildfiny was the responsibility  of the National Road Service
(SNC) and excoeded the appraisal target. About 56 km of now roads were
constructed  and  improved,  and approximately 65 km of roads were improved.
Maintenance was satisfactory dtring the rainy  season.   Since  the  pro3ect
ended there has been no further maintenance and roads are again interrupted
during the rainy season.
3.23     Llama Dehairina Research.  No work was conducted on this component.
3.24     Solar Enerav.  No recoras or reports were kept on the services of a
consultant hired for the soLar energy research and development. At the
initial stages. greenhouses were constructed wLth good but expensive
materials not easily availa6ioe in Ulla Ulla when in many places of the
Altiolano there are functional greenhouses made of sand bricks and a sheet
of  plastic  or  corrugated  plastic  panels.   About  27  greenhouses  were
constructed. principally near schools for demonstration purposes.  It  seems
that this component partially fulfilled its ob3ectUve farmers started to
gain interest in horticultural production for home consumption.
3.25     Health.  This prograurd.e taced  several  problems  due  to  the  low
educational level and old traditions enrgrained in the Ulla Ulla society and
was opposed by traditional healers or wLtch doctors.  The  area  was  served
from  a  nearby  valley and by lucL healers called ytIrL".5  Thus initially
the pro3ect's paramedics were re3ected. People complained of excessive fees
Charged by the doctor. Ttoe rewyura also had a bad experience with a previous
vaccination programme by the Ministry of  Health.   Slowly. however,  women
responded and beyan attevntung the medical courses offered and enrolled their
childron in the vaccination campaigns.  A medical centre was constructed  at
Ulla  Ulla  and must If tlie equipment was purchased.  A medical post was set
up at Chanesani  and 5 health centres were opened in thO region from  the  30
micro-health  ,ousts  pauuusu   irn  the  appraisal report.  From 1980 to 1986
about 2,800 children benefitted annually from the vaccination campaigns.  At
the  ena  of  198b  all  iretrastructure  and equipment of this component was
turned over to the HinLstry of Health.
3.26     The lack of knuwleudyg  of the social structure of Ulla Ulla and  the
language barrier were critical constraints for the achievement of the
ob3*ctives of the healtta cuoieuurgeuet.  Even the  newly  constructed  and  well
equipped health facility at Ochacachi, that was thought to be used by the
pro3ect for more serious noedcal treatment, is  scarcely  used.   Since  the
people come to see the doctor only at very advanced stagos of illnoss,
doctors and hospitals aic assuciated with dying.
3.2?     Water SupplV and  Wasto  Oisoosal.   About  100  water  pumps  were
irstalled  from  the  1t200  estimated  in  the  appraisal  report and 1,000
families benefitted from it.  Fruoms ttee 1,000  pit  privies  expected  to  be
constructed  only 82 were achieved.  In addition a 10 km of cement canal for
communal water supply was  curst.ucted  at  the  pro3ect  area.   The  local
customs and traditxons were difficult to overcome in introducing new
sanitation practices.  Farneeas wse- rwluctant to provide  their  own  labour
for the construction of theso facilities, and refused to participate in the
construction fer the pro3ect because thuy did not understand its ob3ectives.



- 76 -
3.2S     EdscatLon.  The appraLsal target was to  construct  25  classrooms,
improve  two,  and  suPport  a  total enrollment of 1.254 students.  The two
classroom units were finished and a total of 15 classrooms were constructed
about  3  per yesrl alung wit. pit privies and 11 houses for teachers.  The
Intermediate school of Ulla Ulla was renovated wLth the  construction  of  a
now eduCational comPlex with fuur classrooms and one house for the teachors.
An average of 500 studonts  are  enrolled  per  year.   Sevoral  educational
booklets were printeid fur Leechting pruposes.  All the facilitzes were turned
over to the Ministry of Education by 19S1.
3.29     The main failute w&s tu organize courses or meetings  with  farmers
to explain the objectivos of the pro3ect. Farmers' complaints were the slow
advancement of classrowim curstruction after it had been offered  to  several
:ouuna.ties.   Only  10  coursos  for  250  adults were dictated after eight
years.
3.30     Women's Ptrticioation.  The appraisal contemplated to assist  about
3.000 women of thtt project agus by improving health and nutritional care.
The component was also supposed to construct 5 training  centres.   None  of
the centres were built.  (urirw the initial four years of the project only 3
courses were dictated. A total of 10 courses, with the participation of
about 2.000 women, web  WJiven uus rng the pro3ect period.
3.31     As  with  the other social components. at the initial stages of the
project it was very  difficult  tu  VeL  wumen  to  participate.   With  the
appointment of the first programme director, some courses were hold in the
area, but with the wrong idea Ut wumenwtls needs and the needs of rural areas.
The second programme director's approach was more realistic and held
demonstrations in tthe wometes ntuiemvs.  Wumen responded  positively  but  were
interested in several activitLes on which the extension workers lacked
experience and knowledge.
B. Dxsbursement
3.32     Total Project disbursements under the project are not known because
of the failure of INFOL to keep proper accounts in US dollars - the records
kept are in current bulivian pesos - and the disarray which occurred in the
Central Sank after tho institution was completely reorganized during the
early part of 1987.  The  voly  reliable  figures  available  are  the  ones
provided  by  tho  Sank's  Disbursement Division (LOALE).  There are no data
available on the guvernewnt s Counterpart disbursements, nor details on  the
EEC's contrLbution of USS2.016.000 which was earmarked for strengthenLng
ASI's extension servLces ;no tiou women's participatLon component.
3.33     Regrettably the Bank's disbursement figures  are  lumped  in  broad
categories  which  do not currespund to the component Classification used in
tho appraisal documont (Table 21.  Anyway, total Sank disbursement  for  the
1978-1987  period (last dissiursetnwnt was made Ln March 198?1 came to USSI3.0
million out of a total loan of USS18 million. Apparently most of the EEC s
contribution   wds   also   uisbursed   during  this  period,  and  possibly
government s counterpart funds were in tho range of US$2 to 4 milLion. so
that  total  project  cost  cuuIU  have  been in the order of USS18 to USS19
million, or about ?St of the initially (appraisal) calculated total project
cost. Of the Sank's funds (luan and credit) also 102 was disbursed.



- 77 -
3.34     Bank funds were to be disbursed over a 5 year period. but  by  the
fifth year (FY 82) only about one half was disbursed (US$9.3 million). and,
of which USSS.t mil.ion corrtsponded to the purchase of tho machinery of the
yarn processing plant.
3.35     The  sluggish  overall  disbursement  rate  was caused by:  a) slow
start of the project during the first two years because of staffing
problems, lack of promotion in the Project area in view of the resistance
that the inhabitants of Ulla Ulla showed towards the project and cumbersome
administrative  Procedures  within  INFOL;   b)  as  the  economy started to
decline and inflation began to accelerate it became increasingly difficult
to obtain counterpart funds; c) the decline in credit resources for sub-
loans ton-farm and handicrafts); di the problems with the yarn procossing
plant which brought to.  standstill the guaranteed price scheme, and this in
turn  influenced  the  intorest  of  farmers  in  productivity   improvement
programmes.
3.36     The  Bank  suspended  disbursement  on  all  projects  during July-
November 1984 and during April-August 198S.
E.   Progurement
2.37     The expoerienee with procuremont was mixed.  The machinery  for  the
yarn processing plant was acquired through (CS procedures, but the complex
regulations of the nation's consvtruler's Office made a drawn out process
out of it that lasted over two years. Roads and social infrastructure were
built by force accounts ano, in general, went  smoothly.   Consultants  were
hired according to Sank regulations. Vehicles were acquired either one at a
time or Ln small lots by direct contract or LCB.
0.   Reoorts and Audltina
3.38     Quarterly progress reports were submitted regularly during most  of
the nine-year project period, although the quality of tnese reports was
unoven; specially for the last * years of the project when directors changea
frequently and staff performance deteriorated noticeably as a result of low
salaries.   The  audited  financial  statements  were,  in  general   terms.
satisfactory but were usually submitted late.
E.   Compliance with Covenants
3.39     There  were 10 major covenants under the loan/credit agreement Isee
Annex 13. but frequent chan4es in directors and senior staff, the political
instability and the worsening of the Bolivian economy made it difficult to
fully comply with some cuvenants.
3.40     Of critical importance for the project * productive aspects was the
obligation of INFOL to establish a pricing policy for fibre and yarn and
creato a stabilization fund. WLth the failure of building the processing
plant INFOL ceased to uurchase the raw wool in 1984, except small amounts
for the obsolete Pulacayo Plant, and farmors lost interest in the project.
Another major non-comP.iarsce was SAS's failure to estaOlish a braneh office
in Ulls Ullg, consequently farmers interoested in crelit had to travel a1L



- 78 -
the way to La Paz.
f.   Performance of Consu&tants
3.41     The  loan  agreement  contemplated  the employment of the following
consultants: a) an expert in administration and management to assist
IIFOL's general manager; bi consultant(s) to carry out a research programme
of llama dehairing; c) engineoring consultant(s) and a textile expert to
provide oxpertase for the operation of the spinning plant, to establish
grading norms and fibre pricing mechanism; di an expert in solar energy and
*) expertis) in pasture and forage and in animal breeding and production.
Further  the  pro3ect  was  to  provide  consultants  to  INSOPIA   in:  f*
organization ard management; 91 marketing and fair organization, and; h)
in textile engineering and  design.   An  education  consultant  was  to  be
soconded to INFOL from the Wurld Bank's Education and Vocational Training
Pro3ect to carry out the education component of the project.
3.42     Out of the 8 consultants to be utilized in the pro3ect. only  three
were actually contracted (textile export. solar energy expert and education
expert). Apparently they performed their duties satisfactorily, but it was
not possible to examine their reports because they were not available in La
Paz.
3.43     The other experts were not engaged for several reasons such as  the
non-completion of the spinning plant, changes in the field research
programme.  the  collapse  of  INBOPIA's  handicraft  component,   lack   of
counterpart funds and the disruptions caused by the frequent staff changes.

tV tNSTITUTIONtAL PERFOO#H4CE
4.1      The agricultural sector of Bolivia was, and still  &s  weak.  which
led  the  government  and  the  Bank to create a new multi-purpose agency to
promote develoPment of the wool industry in the country Ln general, and more
specifically, to bring about socio-economic improvements in one of the
Altiplano's  most  backward  regions.   However.  thoro  was  little  or  no
tradition  in  Bolivia  to  deal  with  such  a complex problem.  It is also
possible that it would have been  difficult  to  find  in  the  country  the
managerial talent to undertake such a complicated project in 5 yoars. As a
result, the performance of tNFOL was way below appraisal  expectations.   Of
course, a rapidly deteriorating economy after 1980 was an additional factor
that went against smooth oroaect implementation: and if this was not enough
the 1982-86 period was n,.sked by political instability and popular unrest
which created even further difficulties to the management of the pro3ect.
(1)
4.2      The  project  expurienced  a  slow  tako off for several reasons as
provLously indicated. But there were two main factors that affected the
slow start: difficulties in recruiting field staff, since ULla Ulla is
rather isolated and does not offer any amenities, and probloms in convincing
the local population of tree advantages offered if they would collaborate
with the project's personnel. tt took INFOL at least two years to have the
basic organizational stiucture in place. while at the same time it
attempted. wLth some success, to begin the implemontation of the components
of the project which reguA.le courainated agreements and activities with at
least seven participating agencies.
4.3      Insufficient  pruvxsion  of  cuunterpart  funds  impaired   project
implementation, but many of the delays experienced after the initial take-
off period can be attributed tu the bureaucratic procedures of other
government  activities.   So  for  example  it was usual for the Comptroller
General's Office to take uP tu urse year to a*crove a major purchase or the
appointment of a consultant.
4,4      INFOL's  administrative pruceaures were cumbersome, inefficient and
costly, according to a 1981 supervision report. they were the result of
antiquated  national  regulations  dad  codes  of  the  powerful Comptroller
General's Office, and of INFOL's growing bureaucracy which had to engender
its  own  paperwork.   In  aadition,  several  General  Managers CLsplayed a
penchant for self-protectivo checks and controls.
4.5      Another factor that reuiuced the  effectiveness  of  INFO.  was  the
continuous turn-over of technical staff as a result of deteriorating
salaries as the inflationary prucsst in Bolivia gained steam. As a result
qualified manpower at headquarters and in the field became increasingly
scarce and most of the prog-a awnes related to impoving  the  productivity  of
alpaca and llama producers came to a virtual standstill on several occasions
(1>      For example, in 1963 a politically inspired movement of Ulla Ulla
farmers and pro3ect staff occupied the project's office in La Paz
for several days demanding the resignation of the first project
directc. who had bewn in tIlat position for almost five years. After
some hosted discussions the director resigned and was replaced by
an atronomist withunt nmarsagrial experience. He was appointed
without the Bank's consent.



- 80 -
after 1963.
4.6      Frequent  changes  also  uccurled at the toP management level.  The
first project director, a capable but cautious manager. served for about S
years and he was followud by tuur other directors, some of them were
nominated by government without prior consultation  with  tho  Bank.   Every
change of director wa6 accumja,sawd by changes of key staff thus further
reducing the efficiency of INFOL.
4.?      INFOL was never ablo tu vstablish a  properly  functioning  N  &  E
unit. Thus thero is an amazing lack of basic data, which is reflected in
this PCR's discussion on the impact ai ttiv pro3ect. INfJL did not prepere a
PCi.



- 81 -
V. AGRICULTURAL ANO ECONO"IC IMPACT
5.1      The lack of basic information  on  physical  output,  prices,  farm
development results, total pro3ect cest or cost by component, make at
impossible to evaluate the agricultural and economic impact of the pro3ect.
This  is  a  reflection.  of course, that the M & e system wh%ch was to have
been carried out by the pro3ect did not function. It is also a reflection
that INFOL kept inadequate records on expenditure.
5.2      With regard to the production impact of the project, it can only be
speculated that probably it was very small because all the productive
components   (livestock   development,   handicraft   promotion,   and  wool
processing) did not function properly and were well below appraisal targets.
The most noticeable Lmpact probably came from certain aspects of the
extension programme, such as improvemint in shearing technology and  disease
control.    However,   little  impact  was  achieved  on  range  management,
nutritional improvements and bresding techniques. It is not known if wool
quality was positively affected through the extension system or if the herd
size increased.
5.3      The economic impact of the pro3ect, in terms of an economic rate of
return, is most probably nil. The fact that a USS5.1 million investment in
the processing plant equipment was never utilized, ant total expenditure
over an eight year period was in the range of USS16 million, is indicative
that the rate of return would not be acceptable, to say the least.



- 82 -
VI. SANK PERFORMANCE
6.1      It is dobatable if the Bank's decision  to  launch  tho  Ulla  Ulla
pro3ect was the correct one. Although it si understandable that the Bank
wished to implement various projects in the Altiplano in * short poriod of
tame in ordor to alleviate rural poverty and improve the living conditions
of rural families in the rogion, it was not correct to have btcome involved
in such a complex scheme that proved to be beyond the capabilities of the
country to run it effectively.
6.2      The Ulla Ulla DCvelopmaent Pro3ect was  an  excessively  complicated
and overly ambitious project which would have required top managerial talent
for its implementation but also highly qualified staff. The Bank was indeed
quite optimistic in assuming that in Bolivia manpower with appropriate
skills could be hired to implement in five years this multi-component and
multi-sectoral pro3ect.
6.3      The  worsening  economic  conditions,  hyper-inflation. the drastic
devaluation of the Bolivian peso, the political instability and the shortage
of counterpart funds. which of course would have been impossible to predict
at the time of appraLsal, exacerbated implementation difficulties.
6.4      The host of problems that emerged during  implementation  indicated
that the institutional and sociological problems of the Ulla Ulla region and
of the operational and political structure of the country's government, were
not sufficiontly dealt with during tho project design stage.
6.5      As with  the  other  two  Bank  rural  development pro3ects in the
Altiplano, (ingavi and Omasuyos - Los And*s) - which, by the way, were of a
simpler design - production targets were overly ambitious, not taking fully
into account the unfavourable natural environment of the Altiplano and the
traditional nature of the Indian society living in the pro3*ct area which
proved to be not too receptive to the Lnnovations tried to be introduced.
6.6      Before the pro3ect.  Ulla  Ulla  herders  had  no  experience  with
institutional credit and, probably, the loan targets established by the
appraisal mission were too optimistac. One of the reasons why the credit
disbursements moved so slowly was that 8A never opened an office in the
pro3ect area, as was stipulated in the agreoment with the Bank. This acted
not only as a malor bottleneck to the credit programmo but influenced
negatively the technical assistance programme since muCh of tho advice
given to farmers requirod investments to become effective. It is aLso
possible that because of this circumstance no comprehensive extension
technology was devoloped.
6.C      An  area  of  ma&or concern for the Bank was tho problem related to
thO construction of the yarn processing plant.   Considerable  time  of  the
supervision effort after 19B2 went into this matter, trying to untangle the
never ending difficulties which were encountered first with the purchase of
the machinery through ICB procedures, and later with obtaining the funds
needed for the buildings and some additional equipment. As it turned out,
this time consuming effort was in vain.



- 83 -
6.8      Because of tho many problems encountered by the Sank's  supervision
m&ss&oas.  Sank  staff,  on  several occasions, recommondod that tho project
should be terminated, but because of country considerations instead the
project closing date was extendvd three tames. The original closing date
was 30 June 1983 and the postponements were 30 June 1984. 30 June 19B5 and
ftnally 31 December 1986.
6.9      The  Bank  kept a closo control over the Project and 21 supervision
mistions visited the project betwoen March 197$  and  Oecomber  1986.   This
g-.vea an average of 2.3 missions per year. The mix of the missions and
resources allocated for supervision were satisfactory. However, there was a
tendency to send too many one-man agronomist missions. Eleven of the t1
missions consisted of one agronomist  only.   Besides  the  above  mentiened
concern with the yarn processing plant. supervision mission continuously
reminded ItNOL. the Ministry of Agriculture and other national authorities
of the need tc provide adequate counterpart funds and the need to ensure
continuity of project staff through providing it with adequate pay and
better   work  incentives.   The  supervision  mission  moritored  regularly
procurement and advised INFOL on the Bank's guidelines and procedures on
these  matters.   The relationships between Bank staff and project personnel
were in general good, but at times pronouncod differences of opinion
surfaced   with  higher  government  authorities, specially  in  regard  to
nominating unqualified porsons as the project's goneral manager.

Vlt. CONCLUSIONS ANO RECONNENOATtONS
7.1      The most serious error in judg9ment in project design of Ulla  Ulla
was  in  trying  to  solve almost simultaneously, or at least within a short
period of five years. a multitude of inter-related problems that effect
Sol.vi's  wool  production in general terms. and in more specific ways, the
Ulla Ulla rogion.  The pro3ect not only pretended to have a strong impact on
alpaca-vacuna-Ilama  production  and  productivity,  but  at  the  same time
intervene  in  the  marketing  of  the  product  and   in   the   industrial
transformation  of  wool  into  yarn.   Simultaneously  it also pretended to
promote wool cottage industries. improvo roads in the project aroa and
upgrade and expand the social infrastructure. The pro3oct was also supposed
to carry out livestock and range management research and initiate, on a
pilot scale. solar energy investigations. Last, but not least, it was to
pursue a womens participation schemo. To do all this. even withrut the
staggering economic problems that were facing the country since the early
1980's would have been too ambitious indeed. A more cautious approach would
have been more adviseable, either by dividing the pro3ect in two separate
schemes - area development and marketing - processing - or by phasing the
pro3ect over a longer period of time. In either of the two approaches
institutional building should have had priority.
7.2      The future of tts pru3ect is in doubt because of the present fiscal
austerity measures adopted by the govornment barely allow the functioning of
INFOL with a minimum of statf at headquarters. Field activities (extension
and research) have come to a virtual standstill. The meager funds released
by government are barely enuugh to cover operating cost of the La Paz
office.  Several attempts have beon made to finish the yarn processing plant
with private capital, but negotiations have failed either because of lack of
serious interest by the private sector or because no agreement could be
reached on the management system of the future plant. The Bank's suggestion
to sell the equipment to the highest bidder is not acceptable to Government.
In other words, any decision on the future of the plant as in a state of
abeyance, and it is unlikely that a decision will be taken in the near
future.
7.3      It would be safe to assume that most of  the  progoct's  impact  on
livestock production and productivity has alroady taken placo, and because
of the breakdown of the extersion and credit service no  further  production
improvemOnt  can  be expected.  The only productive component which has been
successful was the vicuia conservation scheme, and it seems  that  no  funds
will be available for its continuation.
1.4      The  main factors responsible for the failur4 of the pro3ect can be
summarlzed as follows:
- the complexity of the pro3ect (16 components and the involvement of
at least 8 different agencies);
- the  isolation  of  the Ulls Ulla region, which makes the hiring of
competent staff difficult;
- the rapid deterioration of the country s economy during the 1981-85
perLod;

* the high turn-over of staff (managerial and technical);
- the ineffectsve performance of the credit scheme;
- the failure to build the yarn procossing plant and its negative
offect on the marketing and prices of the wool produced by pro3ect
beneficiaries;
Projects in the Altiplano should be located in areas thst have relatively
good access and should not be too isolated in order to: faciliate
integration with the rest of the country, make its supervision e*sier from
headquarters and, facilitate the hiring of competent te*cnical staff.
75 s     Lastly.  the question arises if the Sank should continue to support
development projects in the Altiplano. In general terms, future Altiplano
pro3ects should be modest in sie*, should use a 'grass-roots* approach in
their execution, and should be basically more livestock than crop oriented.
(For more details see the PCRs for the Ingavi and Omasuyos - Los Andes
pro3ects).

PROJECT COMPLETION REPORT
I. INTRODUCTION
1.1      During  the  late  1960's  and  early  1970's  the  performance  of
Bolivia's economy was mixed. Investment In the private sector was weak but
at the same time the public sector strongly expanded employment. The sharp
increase of petroleum and minerdl prices in tne mid 1970's brought about an
investment and consumption boom which, nevertheless, did not last long. As a
consequence,   the   agricultural   and  the  mineral  sectors  declined  in
importance, and the country- had to rely increasingly on its petroleum
resources. The share of -the agricultural sector in the GOP, shrunk from
about 30% in the early 1960's to 20% in 1974, while during this period
agricultural production in the lowlands, based on large size commercial
farms, expanded output of exportable cash crops (sugarcane, cotton and
soya). The smallholders of the Altiplano and intermediate valleys, which
probably comprise over 80% of the farming population, were very little
affected by the changes occuring in the agricultural sector or the economy
in general.
1.2      Since 1980 Bolivia's  economy  deteriorated  rapidly  declining  by
almost 20% in the following six years . The agricultural sector fell by 7%
during the same period and the total value of exports decreased by some 50%.
The all time low was reached in 1985 when the annual inflation rate reacned
the 20,000% figure and the offical exchange rate fell at the end of the year
to 1.5 million pesos per US$ (In 1980 it was Sb25 = USS.OO). Without doubt,
the general economic decline experienced by the economy can largely be
attributed, on the one hand to the, economic policies persued by the
Government of Bolivia, and on the other hand, to a declining of world prices
of the coutntry's main exports. Since the beginning of 1985 the Government is
implementing a new economic policy which so far has made a remarkable
progress in controlling inflation and is beginning to establish order in :te
economy.
1.3      About 45% of the country's population live  in  the  Altiplano,  an
area noted for its harsh climate. Altitude varies from 4,000 to 5,000
meters, rainfall is in the 400-500 =m/year range, freezing temperatures are
frequent, hail storms occur regularly and its agricultural potential is low.
The majority of Altiplano farmers live at almost subsistence levels, using
primitive technology and their farms are a mixture of crops (potatoes,
barley, quinua and oats) and livestock, (cattle, sheeps, llamas and alpaca).
By and large, they have received little credit and extension services. 4ost
of them lave remained isolated from the main stream of the Bolivian society
because of Language and cultural barriers.



- 94 -
1.4      Since  the mid 1970's the Government, with the assistance of bi-and-
multilateral.agencies, started to channel increased financial and technical -
resources to the Altilano, and emphasis was given to integrated rural
development projects. The Bank strongly suported this effort through three
projects: Ingavi, Omasuyos-Los Andes and Ulla-Ulla which were conceived as
1ntegs-ated and balanced social and economic development schemes.
tI. PROJECT FORMULATION
Identification. Preparation and Appraisal
2.1   ; 1'i'Omasuyos-Los Andes Rural Oevelopment Project was identified  as
the  outcome of the experience gained through the WB financed Ingavi Project
which became effective in July 1976. As a matter of fact, the Omasuyos-Los
Andes region borders with the Ingavi project.
2.2      The  project  was  identified  and  prepared  by the FAO-World Bank
Cooperative Programme following two missions in February 1978 and August
1978. A Bank mission appraised the project during October of 1978.
2.3      The  main  recommendations  of the appraisal mission were that: (a)
the Government would establish a central semi-autonomous agency depending
from the Ministry for Peasant. Affairs and Agriculture (MACA) for the
coordination of the Ingavi and the Omasuyos-Los Andes projects. The agency
became known as IDRA (Institute for the Rural Development of the Altiplano);
(b) a proJect director would be appointed by Government with  qualifications
and experience acceptable to IDA; (c) the Government would not replace the
Project Director or Sub-Directors until three years after the project's
closing date without approval of IDA; (d) the Government would maintain a
USSZOO,OOO revolving fund to ensure sufficient and timely availability of
inputs for project farmers under the credit scheme; (e) the Government would
cause BAB to establish an office in either Achacachi or Nuarina; (f) the
Government would cause the Project Unit to enter a contractual arrangement
with INFOL, INBOPIA and FOMO for the promotion and development of handicraft
activities;   (g)  the  Project  Unit  would  provide  subloans  to  project
beneficiaries, and the subloans would be to farmer groups and all members of
a farmer group would be collectively responsible for the repayment of the
subloan.
2.4      No decision meeting was held on the project since it was considered
unnecessary given its close links with the Ingavi and the similarity of
approach with the project.
Negotiations and Board Approval
2.5      The regotiations between Bank and the Government of Bolivia on- the
proJect'3 approval centered around the basic issues mentioned in paragraph
2.3. An undertanding Aas reached on all assurances and conditions of the
loan. Separate negotiations were conducted between IFAD and the Government
on specific matters related to the credit component.
2.6      The Board approved the loan of US$3 million in  July  of  1979  and
IFAD approved the credit component (USS 4 million) during September 1979.
The Board did not consider the project as a high risk operation, because of
previus experiences by Bank/IDA operations in the Altiplano. Nevertheless,
It was pointed out that the success of the project would be closely linked



^ 95
with the attraction and retention of qualified staff, specially in the
project area, since it was understood that In Bolivia there was a shortage
of this type of personnel.
Prolect ObJectives and Descritior,
2.7      The main objectives of the project were to: (a) increase the income
and basic food supplies of about 6,000 low-income farmer families; (b)
improve roads and sanitary conditions; (c) provide technical assistance; and
(d) provide credit to about 2,500 small farmers for farm investment and
working capital for agriculture and forestry production. To achieve these
objectives, the project was to provide the means to:
a) establish   a   central   coordinating   agency   to   assume   the
responsibility of the development of the project through a project
unit;
b) make sub-loans to finance:
- on farm investments by farmer groups including purchase of
livestock (cattle, sheep and alpaca), equipment, farm
tools and corrals, sheds, silos, etc. (including 12
tractors);
- Annual production credit to cover costs of improved seeds,
agricultural   chemicals,   oxen,   machinery    services,
fisheries and vegetable growing;
c) a forestry programme consisting of:
- establishment of  a  nursery  with  an  annual  productive
capacity of about 400,000 seedlings, including a research
prugramme;
- long-term credit for the establishment of 6C3 ha of forest
plantations in private and/or communally held marginal
land;
d) the improvement and maintenance of about 50 km of feeder roads;
e) to construct and install about 4,000 motor pumps in shallow wells
for water supply and 3,000 privies for sanitation.
f) To increase production through changes in the cropping patterns,
five models were established in the appraisal report;
2.8      The proposed cropping  pattern  was  sought  to  increase  cropping
intensity, and mainly increase potatoes, quinua, broad beans and barley
production, The livestock models would increase animal units per hectare and
milk, wool and alpaca fiber production.

Prolect Cost and Financina
2.9      The, project cost was estimated to be USS9.32 million, and the base
line cost cm - to US$7.6 million (Table 1). The Bank-IDA loan would finance
USS3.0 million or 32% of project costs. The proposed IFAD credit was
estimated to be USS4.0 million and the GOB US$2.2 million investment. The
major components were: (a) productive investment of USS4.3 million mainly
financed by IFAD; (b) infrastructure for about USS0.7 million;' and (c)
administrative   and  technical  support  of  US$2.7  million,  the  largest
component financed by the Bank.
III. PROJECT IMPLEMENTATION
3.1      The loan was approved in June 1979 and became  effective  in  April
1980. This delay was caused by difficulties in the provision of local funds,
staffing problems of the Project Unit and the establishment of the
Coedinating Committee. The overall implementation and responsibility for
the project was g1ien to the Institute for Rural Development of the
Altiplano (IDRA), which was established in March, -1979 as a condition of the
Loan Agreement between the Bank, IFAD and the GOB. The Project Unit (UPOLA)
at Achacachi,  'located   n  Zone II at the central area of the 5 Zones into
which the  two  provinces  of  Omasuyos  and  Ls  Andes  were  divided  for
implementation and administrative purposes. IBRA was also made responsible
for coordinating the Ingavi Project (Loan 1211-BOL). The appraisal estimated
a four year-implementation period with the closing date set by 30 June.1984,
but the actual implementation period was seven years with the closing date
at 31 December 1986.-
A. Achievements bY Components
3.2      Project achievements are detailed and summarized in Table 1.
3.3      On-Farm  Investment  - During  the  first semester of 1980 UPOLA's
extension agents organized farmer groups. Almost no credit was given for
livestock, mainly due to the lack of GOB funding for long-term loans. Only
in the fourth year of project implementation, were 22 ewes bought by the PU
and purchased by individual farmers.
3.4      For  the  first  planting  season  1981-82  (September/October) and
harvest (April/May), about USS1,100 of credit were disbursed only for manual
sprayers. In 1982, disbursements increased to US$14,000. For the following
four years, credit disbursements increased to about   a  yearly  average  of
US$30.000 for the same equipment as it was the only item available. Later in
1986 did the PU purchase farming tools, so credit disbursement increased to
US$50,000 (Table 2). Total lending for on-farm investment was US$100,000, or
about 6% of the appriisal estimate.
3.5      The greatest effort was directed at cropping activities.  Livestock
development   received  a  low  priority.  The  facilities  constructed  and
established for the livestock aclimatization farm in the INGAVI project were
never used.



- 97 -
3.6      Tractors - The appraisal estimated that about 12 tractors would  be
available for the purchase by farmer groups. About four organizations were
interested anvd investment plans were prepared. IFAD did not approve the
applications, because they were submitted near the closing date of the
disbursement agreement. The PU intention to purchase 2 tractors for leasing
them to the farmers was never accomplished.
3.7      Production  credit  -  Farmer  groups were organized for collective
borrowing (Table 2) and UPOLA field staff  prepared  the  investment  plans.
Credit  disbursement  was  initiated  for  the crop year 1981/82 and came to
about USS 92,000; for 1982/83 it increased to US$158,000. In 1983/84 it
slightly decreased to USS139,000; for 1984/85 it reached about USS427,500.
Due to hyperinflation it was not possible to calculate the exact P;ounts of
disbursements  in  1985.  For  the last year of project activities, 1986/87,
disbursements were about USS241,000 (Table 1). According to available data,
total IFAD disbursements for credit of about US$2.6 million were not
disbursed by UPOLA or BAB. Only about USS.O million was disbursed  by  BAB,
excluding 1985, which could be assumed to have been not more than USS0.3
million. This indicates that only 50% of the funds to be provided by the GOO
were eventually disbursed.
3.8      As  stated  previously (para 3.5), the major efforts were placed on
agricultural development . Potatou, was the crop with most credit demand  as
fertilizer was  usually  available  and about 77% of total credit,disbursed
went to this crop; 7% went for pastures; 4% for oats and 3% for horticulture
(Table  3).  Only  for  the  first  crop  year, did. PU extensionists prepare
investment plans for individual farmers. In the following years  because  of
increasing  politization  of  the  farmers' groups the-credit was channelled
directly to the organizations and subloans were given with little  technical
criteria.  It  seems  that  the objective was to provide every farmer family
with a loan within  each  organization,  disregarding  farm  size,  cropping
patterns, or specific farmer requirements. So for example, in certain years
each farmer received two bags of fertilizers, no matter the size of his
holding.
3.9      The  cri.Jit  programme  was  plagued  by a myriad of problems. Loan
applications were complex and their processing slow. From approved amounts
of credit only a fraction was effectively disbursed because of the
unavailability or shortage of inputs. On-farm controls by PU staff was
uneven.  The scarcity of inputs, for example, was so severe in 1985 that the
average loan per farmer for potatoes was only US$21. Farmers were  aware  of
the  damages  caused  by  the  "white  worm." (Pernotrypes vorax), but during
several years  they  received  only  1  to  5  kg  of  pesticides,  and  the
applications had little or no effect.
3.10     Through  data  collected  at the Achacachi Office of the PU, it was
possible to calculate hectares covered by fertilizer delivered for potatoes.
Similarly   with   seed   quantities   delivered   for  oats,  pastures  and
horticulture, it was possible to construct  the  area  covered  through  the
credit programme. The total area came to 14.760 ha in six years (Table 2).
The appraisal report indicated that about 6,000 farmers would participate in
the credit scheme, with a total farm area of 14,960 ha.
3.11     BAB  opened a small office in Achacachi but it was mainly concerned
with credit recoveries and it was closed by 1985. Since then every Friday  a
credit  officer travels to the PU Office to receive loan payments. Initially
there was a good coordination for the accounting control between BAB and
the PU. Although loans went to organizations. responsibility for repayment
was on an individual basis. According to actualized (June 1987) data



- 98 -
supplied by BAB, portfolio in arrears was as follows; for 1981 about 20%;
1982, 25%; 1983, 14%; 1984, 12%; 1985, 70% and for 1986, 98% of the credit
disbursed. The recovery of these arrears figures is in doubt. Some farmers
took advantage of the hyperinflation and repayed loans with insignificant
amounts of local currency before the foreign currency index for interest
rates was established by the GOB.
3.12     The forestry comPonent   was  a  complete  failure  even  though  a
nursery was established to produce about 400,000 seedlings annually. About
150,000 plants were produced before the nursery was occupied by the
labourers because the PU failed to pay their wages. Most of the plants
produced were donated to rural schools and a few were given to farmers. No
credit was disbursed for this purpose.
3.13     Roads  -  Until  1984  the road component was not operating. In the
Ammendment fgreement of November 1984, Part C-1 was modified to open  a  new
road of approximately 20 km from Carmen Sipe to Santiago de Nuata. By 1986
the SNC has completed about 15 km of a good quality gravel road. No feeder
road maintenance was done in the project area.
3.14     Water  supply and waste disposal - This component was too ambitious
to achieve the appraisal targets. The 1984 Ammendment modified substantially
the targets to 150 wells and 150 privies, from 4,000 and 3,000 respectively.
By 1986. 62 wells and 132 privies were constructed. Local customs were
difficult to overcome, but at the end the main constraint for constructing
more wells was the lack of locally manufactured pumps.
3.15.    Technical services - The  appraisal  mission  considered- that. the
Omasuyos-Los Andes Project should be executed in a coordinated manner with
the neighbouring Ingavi Project, and for that purpose IDRA, was established
as  a  coordinating 'umbrella" o-gan1zation for both schemes (see para 2.3),
but each project would have autonomy in so far as implementation is concern
and with its own Project Director, administrative and technical staff. This
project unit was named UPOLA (Unidad del Proyecto Omasuyos-Los Andes). All
staff would be Bolivian nationals. UPOLA was located In Achacachi and would
have five zones for impleme-tation purposes, each of which would have a
zone chief, extension and credit officers and administrative staff.
3.16     At  Achacachi  an  administrative  centre  would  be built, but the
construction of the various needed facilities was never completed. Of s05
housing units only two were finished, and are used as offices. A 500 m
storage structure and the water supply system was also completed. Other
structures (offices and a training centre) are in a semi-finished stage and
further works have come to a standstill.
3.17     Of the contemplated purchase of vehicles (16 four wheel-drive cars,
24 motorcycles, 2 trucks, 5 pick-ups and one carry-all) only 15 vehicles
were purchased (pick-up and jeeps) and about 8 are in running order, the
other ones are unusable for lack of spare parts.
3.18     The   performance   of   UPOLA's   is   discussed   in  Chapter  IV
(Institutional Performance) but let it suffice, at this  point  to  indicate
that the PU's work programme fell below appraisal expectations, largely
because of the continuous turn-over of staff, budgetary restrictions,
failure to develop a coherent work programme and it became excessively
involved in credit operations.

B. Disbursements
3.19     Total disbursements under the project were USS 5,219 million 56% of
the appraisal loan amount. BANK-IDA disbursement came to USS2,027,799 - 68%
of the loan amountltand IFAD disbursement was USS 2,578,670 - 64% of loan
amount. At a slow start (second year of project effectiveness) disbursements
were about 40% of appraisal phasing per year for Bank-IDA and about 25% for
IFAD. The continuous changes of IORA directors and staff and repeated
massive resignations of field and office staff was one of the major
obstacles to project execution. Unavailability of required inputs, certified
seed and agrochemicals, was an additional constraint for loan disbursements.
IFAD's decision to amend its Loan Agreement and to import directly improved
the implementation together with the BANK-IDA USS300,000 Special Account set
at the Central Bank of Bolivia, in 1984.
3.20     The BANK-IDA suspended disbursements an  all  projects  in  Bolivia
from July 1984 to November 1984 and from April 1985 to August 1985 because
of non-compliance of the Government with its obligations to the Bank.
C. Procurement
3.21     Procurement became a  problem  under  the  project.  Initially  the
scarcity of inputs at the local market caused a major constraint. In 1985,
IFAD decided to import directly through ICS agrochemicals and  other  inputs
and it caused a serious problem because prices of most imparted items were
hi her than the ones prevailing in the local market. ProJect components as:
(a) roads were built through force accounts by SNC; (b) pumps for wells were
bought locally through normal local procedures; (c) vehicles were purchased
by bidding in small lots, but problems arised in the purchase of spare-parts
because they were not available in the local market
D. Reports and Auditing
3.22     Quarterly progress reports  were  submitted  regularly  during  the
first years, later because of the high turn-over of executives and staff
progress reports were sent irregularly. Financial statements and audit
reports have been sent to the Bank since 1980. BANK-IDA agreed to contract
an audit firm for the 1985 and 1986 auditing, but due to misunderstandings
in using the Special Account at the Central Bank, the firm has not been
paid yet and the 1985-1986 audit reports have not been released.
E. Compliance with Covenants
3.23     Frequent changes in management positions, the political instability
and  the deteriorating economic conditions made it difficult to fully comply
with some important covenants.
3.24     Detailed information  for compliance with  relevant  covenants  are
shown in Annex 1.

IV. INSTITUTIONAL PERFORMANCE
4.1      The Project Unit (UPOLA) based in the project  area  at  Achacachi,
covered S Zones into which the two Provinces were divided for working
purposes. The PU Director was appointed with the acceptance of IDA and by
Apri1, 1980 full complement of staff was in place. However, frequent changes
of  directors  (eleven  in  seven  year:)   brought   about   administrative
discontinuities.   Several   times   tec.; cal   staff  resigned  massively,
particularly as tne economic conditions of the country declined and salaries
fell to unacceptable levels.
4.2      Since  the  initial  stages,  UPOLA  and IORA staffing schemes were
Inadequate to carry out the proposed extension coverage for the farmers in
the project area. About 32 technicians (9 professionals and 23 technical
agents) were hired to work at the Central Administration Office in La Paz
and 30 (9 professionals and 21 technical agents) in the project area. By
1982 the number of extensionists in the project area declined to 20; then
increased to 45 in 1985 and by the end of 1986 only 6 extensionists with the
Technical Director of UPOLA were at Achacachi.
4.3      At the beginning of operations  UPOLA's  extensionists  performance
was considered sat.sfactory. Later on with inflation at the end of 1982 and
as staff salaries decreased in real terms,good technicians resigned and
overall efficiency was reduced due to lack of incentives.
4.4      The  technical assistance contemplated in the appraisal report (one
man year of a dairy specialist) was never contracted because of the little.
attention given to livestock development. IORA's administration was not able
to establish an effective M&E system. The M&E unit did not collect
production data, nor analyze the impact of the different components or the
performance of the project. Consequently the project directors lacked the
feedback to be expected from a well run M&E system and were not able to
improve the performance of "he project as a whole. Frequent staff changes at
headquarters and at UPOLA, of course, did not help matters. IDRA was not
able to prepare a PCR and data available was basically limited to credit
operations. With such inadequate data base it was not possible to prepare a
reliable economic and agricultural impact analysis.
V. AGRICULTURAL AND ECONOMIC IMPACT
Agricultural Impact
5.1      The project did not have the expected impact  on  farm  development
and actual achievement fell below appraisal standards. Although credit
reached a substantial number of farmers, the amounts disbursed were
insufficient and deliveries were often late, which of course had negative
effects on productivity. At appraisal yield increases in potatoes were
estimated from 4 to 8 mt/ha and in alfalfa from 6.3 to 12.5 mt/ha. At the
same time it was estimated that the number of cattle, sheep and alpacas
would increase, and daily milk production per cow would be 8 litres,
compared to 3 litres at pre-project levels.
5.2      Appraisal established 5 farm models which contemplated  changes  in
the cropping nattern. Actually in these two Altiplano provinces farmers have
besides crops, also dairy cattle and sheep. The region is not very
appropriate for alpaca rearing, although in the western part there are a
limited number of flocks. The Appraisal report contemplated not only



- 10.1.~
increases in the cultivated area but also in the production of potatoes,
quinua, broad beans, oats, milk, sheep and alpaca wool and timber. In
potatoes, the, main crop, output should have increased from 8,000 to 31,600.
mt and in milk from 540 thousand to about 8.2 million litres.
5.3      The climatic conditions of the project area are very  unstable  for
crop farming. During appraisal this risk was undervaluated and it was
assumed  that  it  would  not  be  a major  constraint  to  the   project's
implementation. Nevertheless the effect of adverse climatic conditions (hail
storms, frost and draught) affected adversely yields in three years out of
six (Table 4). Apparently in the project area the "agricultural risk
factornis of about 50%. Farmers are well aware of this situation, and
consequently their main source of income is based on livestock, mainly dairy
cattle and sheep. Their main cash crop is potatoes and other crops like
quinua, oca, broad beans and peas are basically used for family consumption.
Barley is not used as a forrage crop and is not found very frequently in the
area. Oats and alfalfa are possibly the most important crops, since they are
used as cattle feed.
5.4      Production data shown in Table 4 refers to the five zones in  which
the project area was divided for administrative purposes and the output of
the farmers groups which were promoted by the Project Unit (UPOLA). Credit
for on-farm investment was practically not used. At appraisal about US$1.6
million were earmarked for this purpose.
5.5      The average yields per ha for the areas which  received  production
credit during six years were for potatoes 5,900 kg/ha which is equivalent to'
a., incease of 47% over the pre-project situation. Most of the fertilizer
used went into potatoes. For barley there was hardly an improvement, yields
having been in the 600-680 kg/ha. In oats 2,000 kg/ha were obtained, mainly
because improved seeds were used; in alfalfa, also because of improved seeds
yields were in the 2,750 kg/ha (dry-matter) range. Probably the highest
yield increases were obtained with grasses through the introduction of new
forage species. Although no specific data could be obtained on this, UPOLA's
field staff indicated substantial improvements in the carrying capacities.
5.6      There  is no information available on the productivity of vegetable
production, although it seems likely that improvements took place because
the project was able :o provide farmers with fresh and certified seeds of
good germination. There was a strong demand for this type of seeds specially
for onions, which the project was not able to meet. Most probably vegetable
production is the most profitable farming activity in the Altiplano, but
viable areas for vegetables are limited in the project area and are mostly
located in the vicinity of the Titicaca Lake were irrigation is possible.
Nevertheless, marketing of vegetables became a problem in years of abundant
production.
5.7      Of the 17,600 ha under crops in 1979 as indicated in the  appraisal
report. about 12.000 ha were under potatoes and barley. The latter has been
almost entirely replaced by oats used, as previously indicated, for forage.
During the last three years of project approximately 3,300 ha/year received
credit, which corresponds to only 27% of the total area cultivated. For
pastures and alfalfa, credit was issued for 1,400 ha and for vegetables 490
ha during the whole period. It would be safe to assume that the previously
indicated yield increases took place mostly in these area which received
credIt. Nevertheless, for 1985 and 1986 because of input shortages a
considerable number of farmers received minimal quantities of fertilizers,
only 5 kg per farmer. Thus, if the number of beneficiaries seems high. the
impact on'their productivity must have been minimal.



102 -
5.8      Cattle raising is  the  main  source  of  income  for  the  project
farmers, specially during unfavourable years. Thus project implementation
should have given greater emphasis to livestock development as envisaged at
appraisal.. NeVertheless, no credit was issued for genetic improvement,
specially when in the neighbouring Ingavi Project there is a station for
cattle  acclimatization.   Production  and  productivity  increases  in  the
livestock  sector  were  mainly  obtained  through  the  establishment   and
improvement of pastures. The PU's field staff estimates that in small farms
(less than 5 ha) there was an increase of one animal unit per farm and two
sheep. It is also indicated that milk output per animal increased from 3 to
6 I/day during a 240 day lactation period. The appraisal report estimated
reaching 8 l/day for a 240 day lactation period over a 3 year period. One of
the more positive aspects of livestock activities is related to the
Improvements in animal health, specialy in relation to internal and external
parasites which took place, having had a strong impact on the reduction of
mortality.
5.9      There  was little improvement in the sheep population. Only 22 ewes
were introduced in the fifth project year.
5.10     Pasture improvement took exclusively place on farms,  and  communal
pastures were completely neglected. Over grazing continues with a gradual
deterioration of these valuable resources.
5.11     The  proposed  changes  in  cropping  patterns  indicated  in   the
appraisal  did  not  take  place.  It  was  contemplated  that the output of
foodcrops would be one  of  the  main. objective  of. the  farm  development
programme. This was' only partially achieved. The area under potatoes
increased due to the availability of fertilizers and pesticides through the
credit scheme.. Also, the area under oats expanded mainly because of the
distribution of improved seeds. The changes that actually took place in the
cropping patterns are shown in Tables 5 and 6 where two farm models are
presented. These indicate only cropping pattern and yields actually obtained
and do not show financial benefits. In the very small farms of two hectares
the area destined for food crops was reduced from 47.5 to 40% of the total
area, but within the surface potatoes increased to 33%. In the farms of 5
ha, there was a slight reduction in the area under foodcrops from 38 to 35%,
but the area under unimproved pastures almost disappeared and was planted
with alfalfa and oats.
5.12     During  the  first  three  years  of  the   project   most   credit
beneficiaries received apparently adequate technical assistance, and farmers
became aware of the importance of fertilizers and pesticides for potatoes
and the benefits to be obtained from improved seeds.
5.13     The  main  factors that influenced the disappointing performance of
on-farm development were:
- the late and insufficient delivery of inputs. It  was  common  that
they were distributed too late to have the expected impact on
productivity;
- the delivery of credit by BAB during the first years was extremely
limited because of lack of counterpart funds;



- 103 _
- the scarcity of good potato and oat seeds limited ctn.siderably the
area that could have benefitted;
- the use of extensionists for credit purposes, leaving then little
time for technical assistance;
- the continuous turn-over of extensionists because of low salaries,
and which went against the development of a coherent technical
assistance programme;
- the steady increase of credit interest rates because of the
hyperinflation, which made farmers reluctant during the later years
of the credit, to apply for it;
- the gradual politization of _.e farmer groups, who eventually
decided the type and amount of credit to be distributed 'e;>>ng
members.
Economic Impact
5.14     The economic rate of return (ERR) estimated at appraisal was  36%.
For this completion report two rates of return were calculated. The first
-one included the cost of all project components, but took into account only
the farmers that benefited from 'the credit component and the second one
included also farmers that are estimated to have berefited from the
technical assistance programme only and were thus able to obtain moderate
yield increases on their farms. although their production cost structure.
remainded at pre-project levels.
5.15    Calculations  of  the  ERR  are  based  on current costs and prices
converted into US dollars. The fist ERR (only farmers that received credit)
is about 10%, while the second estimate (all farmers) is 13.1% (Tables 7 and
8).
5.16    The calculated ERR's should be considered only notional because  of
the limited information available on production costs and output prices. The
hyperinflation and pronounced differences in the dual exchange rates
existing during the 1981-1984 period undoubtedly introduced pronounced
distortions in the estimates, and probably only month-by-month calculations
could have presented a more realistic picture. It should also be kept in
mind that the free exchange market rate varied daily, while the official
exchange rate was only a fraction of the free market rate. Under these
conditions  serious  shortages  in  the  availability   of   inputs   became
commonplace, investment was discouraged, benefits became uncertain and
speculation was encouraged. As a result input-output and cost-benefit
analysis should be treated with due reservation.
VI. BANK PERFORMANCE
6.1     Undoubtedly,  the  Bank's  decision to launch a third small farmers
project in the Altiplano was correct, since the project was geared towards
alleviating rural poverty and improving living conditions of rural families
in the region. The overall concept of the Omasuyos - Los  Andes  scheme  was
also appropriate and it complemented not only the Government's policy to
indce development in such a backward area, but it also complemented the
neighbouring Ingavi scheme.



- 104 -
6.2      Nevertheless,   the   host   of   problems   that   emerged  during
implementatian indicated that the institutional, technical and  sociological
problems were not sufficiertly dealt with during the project design stage,
although the Omasuyos-Los Andes scheme was a relatively simple project,
strongly emphasizing farm development.
6.3      During  the  seven-years implementation period serious difficulties
were encountered. Most of them were related to the deteriorating economic
conditions of the country, the hyperinflation, the drastic devaluation of
the Bolivian peso, political instability and shortage of counterpart  funds.
It would have been impossible to predict these occurences at the time of
appraisal.
6.4      As with the neighbouring Ingavi project,  production  tarqets  were
overly ambitious, not taking fully into account the unfavourable and
consequently risky climatic and natural environment of the Altiplano for
agricultural production. It also seems that not sufficient attention was
paid to farmers attitudes, which because of the harsh and unpredictable
environment,   have   adopted   strong  risk  averting  attitudes  regarding
subsistence food production. Consequently, farmers practice mixed crop-
livestock farming in order to minimize the high climatic risks of the
Altiplano.
6.5      At appraisal a balanced crop-farming livestock development strategy
was envisaged. However during implementation almost all the effort went irto
crop development, although the benefits from livestock development would
have  had. a more noticeable impact on farm income and would have built up a
hedge against inflation and bad climatic years.
6.6      Before the project, the region's farmers had little experience with
institutional credit and it is possible that the credit targets established
during appraisal were too optimistic. But at the same time, it seems that
if credit operations would have been organized differently the impact on
productivity would have been more pronounced. The credit scheme became the
main responsibility of UPOLA, and the role played by BAB limited itself
basically to recuperation of loans. As a consequence field staff became
overly preoccupied with the preparation of loans, their approval and
distribution of inputs (credit in kind). They had little, or no time, to
concentrate on technical assistance. As a consequence no comprehensive
extension  methodology  was  developed,  which  should  have   systematicaly
emphasized those aspects of production which could have had a decisive
impact on family incomes.
6.7      BAB's office at Achacachi, was estabished at the beginning  of  the
project, but closed in the later part of 1985. It was weakly staffed and
poorly equipped and its main functions became the ones of a simple
collection agency. If it would have developed full fledged credit activities
(group formation, credit promotion, on-farm investment development schemes,
control of clients, etc.), it would have been possible to have UPOLA's field
staff free to concentrate on extension activities. The existence of an
effective bank branch in the area could have possibly insured that credit
operation would have continued after the termination of the project. One of
the major concern and complaints of farmers at the moment (June 1987) is
that there will be no credit Available for the coming planting season
(1987/1988).



-105-
6.8      During implementation, Bank and IFAD missions made frequent  visits
to the project area and worked closely with UPOLA's staff on possible
project reformulations - one actually took place during 1984 - and made
special efforts to keep the project afloat. Supervisions involved a great
deal of assistance to project management, and intervention with Government
agencies   specially   with  MACA,  for  steps  needed  to  insure  improved
implementation. A specially difficult occurring problem was the, frequent
removal  of  IORA's  directors  by  Government  and  the nomination, without
consultation with the Bank, of incompetent or inexperienced individuals.
6.9      One of the most adverse effects of the frequent changes  in  IORA's
management, was that each new director replaced key technical staff at
headquarters and in the field which, as was to be expected, brought serious
disruptions to the implementation in the project or changed the emphasis
given to the various project programmes.
6.10     Bank supervision was uneven. Of the 19 missions which  visited  the
project, 7 took place in 1982. and for the other years threre were two per
year. Eleven oi the missions corsisted of one agriculturalist, indicating
the concern of the Bank with productlon and productivity problems. A special
feature of most supervision missions was that they remind the local
authorities of the consequences on project performance of inadequate and
irregular counterpart funding and the need to pyovide continuity of project
staff   through   adequate   incentives   and   better  working  conditions.
Regrettably, most of the supervision missior advice on these matters fell on
deaf ears. Procurement procedures were properly monitored by the supervision
missions, but they were, not always carried out satisfactorily (see. para.
3.21).  By  and  large,  relationships  between  Bank  staff, Government and
project administrative and technical staff was amiable. There was a close
and good cooperation between the Bank's and IFAD's staff, who often met in
Bolivia and tried to solve the various problems encoutered with the project.
VII. CONCLUSIONS AND RECOMMENDATIONS
7.1      Omasuyos-Los Andes was the third Bank- financed  rural  project  in
Bolivia's Alttp:ano within a short span of time. There was a limited
technical, and economic knowledge, and the data base to support the project
was  weak.  Considering the present fiscal austerity measures adopted by the
Government and the uncertainty about the future of project management
services (UPOLA) dealing with credit and extension, it would be safe to
assume that most of the project's impact on production and productivity has
already taken place. It could also be assumed that farmers that have been
using technical inputs provided under the credit scheme, and that have
absorbed better technologies through the technical assistance component of
the project would be ready to continue to do so in the future. However it
should be kept in mind that the supply of institutional credit, with the
termination of the project, has come to an end and that the field services
of UPOLA have also come to a standstill. As a consequence it would be
reasonable to assume that a considerable number of farmers will slowly
revert to pre-project conditions if this situation prevails.
7.2      There  are  three  major  factors that have contributed to 'he poor
performance of the project:
- The rapid deterioration of the country's economy during the 19el-
1985 period, (hyperinflation, drastic devaluation of the Bolivia
peso and continucus political and social instability). These



- 106 -
factors, of course, were beyond the control of the Bank and project
management;
- The adverse and harsh ecological env1roment of the Altiplano which
makes agriculture - but not livestock - activities a risky
proposition. This could have been ameliorated if the technical
packages available at the time would have been properly .supported
during implementation with adequate extension services and input
supply and credit systems.
- the ineffective pLrformnce of the credit component where the
interest of politicized farmers' groups, which were influential in
disbursement procedures, often over-ruled the technical criteria of
UPOLA's staff.
7.3      Another  serious  drawback  to the project's implementation was the
close link existing between IORA and MACA and the frequent changes occurring
in the latter which affected IORA's continuity of management. A lesson to be
drawn from this, is that future projects in the Altiplano, or elsewhere in
Bolivia, should be linked to official institutions that have shown in the
past greater stability than MACA, such a regional developmet corporations or
the   National   Planning   Secretariat   of  the  President's  Office.  Non
governmental organizations.could play an important role in any new schemes.
7.4      Other principal recommendations would be: (a)  in  order  to  avoid
inefficient  and  politically  influenced  credit operations, credit schemes
should be managed by specialized credit institutions, such as  BAB,. and  if
this bank proves to be inefficient it should be strengthened as part of the
project; (b) technical assistance services should exclusively dedicate
themselves to improve on-farm production and productivity; (c) as long as
there are no sound and proven agricultural (crop) packages for the unique
Altiplano environment, projects should emphasize more livestock than crop
development, except in specific a'eas where irrigation is technically and
financially feasible; (d) in depressed areas like the Altiplano, during
preparation appraisal close attention should be paid to the political and
institutional constraints to development. In the specific case of Omasuyos-
Los Andes excessive attention was paid to farm-model work, which resulted in
a futile exercise since during implementation little, or no attention was
paid to them because, by and large, farm models did not correspond to the
socla-economic realities of the project area; (e) counterpart funds release
in Bolivia became a major stumbling-block to project implementation not only
because of the difficult economic situation of the Government but also
because of the archaic, complex and time consuming administrative procedures
of Government when dealing with budgeted money releases. In order to avoid
this bottleneck a flexible mechanism for releasing counterpart funds to
projects should be devised on the principle of revolving funds which should
be replenished on a yearly basis.
7.5      Given the poor performance of the Bank's projects in the Altiplano.
the question arises if the Bank should continue to support agricultural
development in that difficult region. In general, future projects,- if it is
decided to initiate new ones - should eirphasize livestock developrent, as a
pre-condition for further productivity increases and should promote on-farm
fodder production. However, crop production should not be excessively
downplayed. In other words, an integrated livestock food crops farming
system should be aimed at. Social components should play only a minor role.
and maybe it would be more desirable to deal with education, sanitation and
public health through specific projects dealing with these matters. In
planning future Altiplano projects, special attention should be given to the



- 107 -
scale of the projects, where possibly small community based schemes loosely
integrated into a broader project would be easier to handle than large
centralized projects. In certain cases, the utilization of NGO's assistance
Should be seriously considered. Special attention would have to be paid to
involve in the planning and execution staces the local communities, in other
words, the approach should be within a "grass-roots" framewrork. Moreover,
particular care will have to be given to the need to keep the institutional
arrangements as simple and flexible as oossible in order to 6btain an
acceptable level of autonomy and efficiency.
