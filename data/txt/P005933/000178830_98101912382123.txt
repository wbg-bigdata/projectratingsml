I. THE AGRICULTURAL SECTOR
A. General Characteristics
1.01      Over 200 million ha, or 75% of the total area of Argentina, are under
agricultural production. Some 140 million ha are covered with natural pastures
supporting a cattle herd that, since 1969, has fluctuated between 48 million
and 56 million head and a sheep flock of the order of 35 million head. About
33 million ha are under crops, mainly wheat, corn, sorghum and oilseeds, and
some 50 million ha are under forests. The country has a variety of climatic
conditions ranging from subtropical to cold, but lies mostly in the temperate
zone. Rainfall is adequate and often abundant in the eastern part of the
country, but diminishes rapidly from east to west. Annual rainfall averages
1,000 mm in the eastern part of the province of Buenos Aires and decreases to
some 500 mm in its western part. On the basis of rainfall, the country is
divided into four general zones extended in parallel from north to south and
known as the humid, semihumid, semiarid and arid zones. Within these four
general zones, the country is divided into several geo-economic regions on the
basis of topography, soils, temperatures and other criteria. The main ones
and most relevant to the project area are the Pampean, the northeast and the
northwest regions.
Main Agricultural Regions
1.02      The Pampean (prairie) region, stretching in a rough semicircle
about 500 km from the city of Buenos Aires, comprises some 40 million ha
of the most productive land in the world. It is located in the humid and the
semihumid zones. This region includes the province of Buenos Aires and parts
of the provinces of Entre Rios, Santa Fe, Cordoba and the La Pampa. The
predominance of deep black, friable chernozem soils and other excellent
ecological conditions for cereals, oilseeds and livestock make it the most
important region, accounting for 60% of the country's population (26 million).
The area supports some 175,000 farms, or 30% of the total number of farms
in the country. The main agricultural activities are production of corn,
wheat and livestock products. With respect to corn and wheat, the region
contributes about 60 and 50%, respectively, of the planted area in the
country and about 70 and 60% of the total production. It also supports
about 50% of the country's cattle and hogs and about 35% of its sheep herd.
1.03      In the northwest of the country lies a humid belt extending in a
north-south direction through the provinces of Jujuy, Salta, Tucuman and
Santiago del Estero. This region is devoted primarily to intensive cropping
and is important for subtropical products such as cotton, sugarcane, tobacco,
rice, tea and citrus fruits, although sorghum and soybeans are of increasing
importance. Substantial areas of the farms located there are covered by
forests, which, to a great extent, have already been depleted of their valu-
able wood but are now being cleared entirely to expand the cropping area.



1.04      Another important region in the country is the northeast, which
comprises the province of Chaco and parts of Misiones, Formosa and Corrientes
provinces. This is a subtropical area, with high temperatures during most of
the year and rainfall ranging from 1,600 mm in the east to 500 mm in the west.
As in the northwest region, much of the area is under forest from which a
substantial part of the valuable hardwoods has already been extracted. How-
ever, since the soils are fertile, they also are being cleared to expand
the farming area, mainly to plant sorghum, sunflower, soybeans, and cotton.
Though the region is not important for livestock, some cattle of Cebu (Brahman)
strains are pastured in the area.
Land tenure
1.05      The abundance of land and particularly of highly fertile soils on
the one hand and the low population density on the other place Argentine
agriculture in an especially favorable position in which the land availability
has neither constrained agricultural development nor led to highly skewed
income distribution in this sector. In fact, rural poverty is exceptional and
restricted to a few pockets in the Northern provinces of Mendoza, Chaco,
Corrientes and Formosa. About 72% of the total land area is privately owned
and the balance belongs to the federal or the provincial governments. The
1969 census indicated that there were some 550,000 farms in Argentina, the
average size being 375 ha, with 33 ha of crop land, 264 ha under pasture and
78 ha under forest or other uses. The land tenure pattern is characterized by
a wide range of farm sizes and different types of operations. The distribution
of farms (1969) according to size is given in the following table:
Farms                        Area in Farms
Pampas     Other       Total     Pampas      Other      Total

25.1 - 200 ha        53         24           40        18           4          9
200.1 -  1,000 ha    20          6           13        29           6         15
Over 1,000 ha          4         7            6        52          89          75

The above land ownership pattern does not, however, truly reflect the rural
income distribution, as smaller farms producing vegetables and crops as well
as medium farms engaged in cropping and livestock are, in many cases, more
productive and earn larger absolute incomes than larger holdings, which usually
are in livestock production on an extensive basis, implying low returns
per unit of land. According to the 1969 census, it is in the areas closest to
the main markets and those with the best soils and climatic conditions that
land is found subdivided into the smaller farms (1 to 50 ha). For example,
such small farms include among others, a large number of high income horticul-
ture farms around Buenos Aires and other major cities.

Productivity
1.06      Factor endowment of extensive land area (about 160 million ha under
agricultural use) with excellent soils and low population density have ac-
counted for the traditional adoption of an extensive pattern of production
for beef, grains and oilseeds. Labor productivity in agriculture is almost
as high as in the rest of the economy, with 15% of the country's labor force
producing 14% of the GNP. Though yields of the main agricultural export
commodities are well below their potential under an intensified production
system, and lower than those of the main beef and grain producing countries,
Argentina's low production costs provide it with a comparative advantage in
feedgrains, oilseeds, beef and, probably, dairy products. In spite of past
Government policies which discouraged intensive agriculture, this sector has
provided sufficient food and fiber for domestic use, as well as large surpluses
for exports. A considerable amount of yield-increasing technology is available,
and current taxation, pricing and credit policies can be expected to promote
its widespread use, particularly in the Pampas.
B. The Agricultural Sector in the Economy
1.07      Historically, the agricultural sector has played a fundamental role
in the country's development. During the 1930s, Argentina was one of the
largest exporters of agricultural products, with exports of maize accounting
for 50% of total international trade. The country was the third largest
producer of wheat and one of the world's main beef suppliers, its exports
averaging over 600,000 tons from 1935 to 1940, but after the Second World War,
due to a series of adverse internal and external circumstances, the situation
began to deteriorate rapidly. In recent years, even though Argentina is still
the world's second largest exporter of coarse grains and the fourth largest
wheat exporter, its share of international trade has dropped substantially
while beef exports dropped to an average of 475,000 tons in 1971-76 (Annex 1,
Table 1). The traditional exports have been wheat, corn, beef, wool, mutton,
pork, hides and skins, lard and tallow as well as animals for breeding and
slaughter. During the past three decades, exports of increasing value have
been sorghum, vegetable oils; oilseed cakes and meals; milling by-products;
and, very recently, cotton, sugar, and soybeans.
1.08      Including forestry and fisheries, which are presently of limited
significance, the agricultural sector in the period 1965-76 accounted for 14%
of GDP at 1960 prices. Excluding the relatively small contribution of forestry
and fisheries, the total sectoral output is fairly equally divided between
crops and livestock, but there are significant regional differences in the
composition of this output. Agricultural exports made up 79% of total exports
in the 1970-76 period, declining in relative importance from 83% in 1970 to
74% in 1976. Between 1970 and 1976, cereals grew from 29% to 31% of total
exports, meats declined from 21% to 14% and oilseed products remained constant
at 10% of total exports. The share of agricultural labor in the economically
active population has decreased by 60% since the turn of the century. From
39% at the beginning of the 1900s, the proportion of total workers employed



in agricuiture declined to 20% in 1950-54 and to 15% in 1970-74. Actually,
of the 26 million population, about 20% live in rural areas, and, of these,
about one-half (2.6 million) are entirely dependent on farm income.
C. Agricultural Production and Marketing
Livestock Production
1.09      Argentina is one of the major livestock producing and exporting
nations of the world due largely to its abundance of fertile, highly productive
land and relatively low population density. Livestock population in 1974 was
55.4 million cattle, 34.5 million sheep, 4.6 million goats, 4.1 million pigs
and 2.8 million horses. Over the past 20 years, its role as a beef exporter
has declined vis-a-vis other major exporters, principally Australia and New
Zealand, because of policies which acted as disincentives to production. These
policies have changed since early 1976 and the country is now in a position to
increase production fairly rapidly. Details on beef production, exports and
consumption are shown in Annex 1, Table 2.
1.10      The Pampean region supports approximately 50% of the country's cat-
tle population and 35% of the sheep flock under production methods which are
relatively sophisticated compared to those in other developing countries.
However, there is considerable scope for further increases in productivity by
adoption of technology similar to that used in the Balcarce Livestock Develop-
ment Project. Production methods are much less intensive in the other major
cattle producing areas, principally the northern and northeastern regions.
Productivity in these areas can be increased by investment in basic improve-
ments such as fencing and water facilities, by land clearing and pasture
improvement and by better disease control and herd management. The sheep
industry has shown little or no growth over the past 20 years.
Grains and Oilseeds
1.11      Cereal production in Argentina is dominated by three main crops,
wheat, maize and sorghum, which accounted for 91% of total grain production
and for 96% of total volume of cereal exports during the period 1974-76. The
main oilseeds are sunflower, linseed, peanuts, and soybeans, which accounted,
respectively, for an average of 50%, 16%, 11%, and 8% of total oil production
from 1974 to 1976. Area seeded to crops remained about constant during the
past decade (1967-76) as follows:

1.12      Aggregate agricultural production has grown at a 2.5% cumulative
rate in the last 10 years. The cropping subsector's growth was about 3.3% as
compared with a 1.1% rate for the livestock subsector. Although the growth
rates of both have been erratic, the livestock subsector seems to be lagging
behind the crop subsector. The bulk of the overall growth of the crop sub-
sector was achieved in the 1976/77 season due to improved sectoral policies
and above-normal weather conditions, mostly affecting cereals and oil-
seeds. The following table summarizes the area harvested and the yields
and production of the major grain and oilseed crops from 1965 to 1969 and
compares data with performance in 1976/77.

1.13      The increase in crop production over the last 10 years is due mainly
to yield increases (2.4% annual) and, to a lesser degree, to expansion of the
cropped area (1.1% annual). Summer-grown cereals and oilseed production in-
creased at a 5.2% cumulative rate. Yields accounted for 52% of the increase
while area expansion contributed the remaining 48%. The production growth
rates of grain, sorghum and soybeans have been most spectacular during the
past few years.  Soybean production grew from around 20,000 tons in 1967 to



- 6 -
1.2 million tons in 1976, while the area planted during the same period
increased from about 18,000 ha to 660,000 ha. Sorghum production has been
increasing in area planted by about 20% per year although yields have in-
creased by only about 15%.
1.14      Practically all of the grain and oilseed crops are produced under
rainfed conditions, mostly in rotation with cultivated pastures and practically
no fertilizers. Most of the yield increases are attributed to the use of
other modern inputs and techniques, such as improved seed, mechanization,
chemicals for plant sanitation and weed control, and better management
practices in general. Favorable weather during the 1976/77 crop year was
also a factor in yield improvements. Fertilizer, however, has been used for
many years on sugarcane, tobacco, fruit and vineyards cultivated on around I
million ha. The low fertilizer use in the Pampas seems to have resulted from
a combination of factors: the belief of farmers that the traditional pasture/
crop rotation without any fertilizer is the most economical system; the adverse
terms of trade represented by the high prices of imported fertilizer vis-a-vis,
until recently (1977), low prices of agricultural products as a result of high
export taxes; and also, until recently, the lack of fertilizer-responsive
varieties of seed produced in the country. Neither the artificial relation-
ship between fertilizer and output prices nor the lack of appropriate planting
materials significantly constrains fertilizer use today. With both products
and inputs priced approximately at international levels, the stage is set for
a gradual expansion of fertilizer use and consequently higher yields.
Marketing
1.15      The country's agricultural marketing system is based on a network of
primary elevator facilities designed to receive grain from farms, weigh it, and
condition (dry, clean and fumigate), store and ship it out to domestic proces-
sors or export silos in the ports. There are three separate groups carrying
out this function, each operating somewhat differently:
(a)  the Junta Nacional de Granos (JNG):  the JNG intervenes directly
in the marketing of the basic grains if Government considers
this advisable to support transactions involving grains, and it
administers the public network of port elevators (27), primary
silos (81) and other complementary facilities;
(b)  Independent Country Merchants:  businessmen who buy grain from
producers, condition it and resell it to exporters or domestic
users; they handle about 55% of total grains and oilseeds
marketed; and
(c) Cooperatives: these operate facilities similar to the independent
merchants and provide the same basic services, except that they
do not buy grain for their own account.
The export sales of Argentine grain and grain products are carried on by
three groups: the "exporters" comprising both national and multi-national
independent companies; the cooperatives operating through their central



organization; and the JNG on a direct basis with foreign governments or
government agencies. Of these, the "exporter" group is by far the most
active and important in terms of volume and trade.
D. Recent Government Policies and Strategy
Sector Priority
1.16      The new economic policy initiated by the Government in April 1976
considers the agricultural sector as the most important and dynamic for
Argentina's export capability and, hence, for its economic development. The
rationale for according such high priority for agricultural production is
supported by the following facts:
(a)  the growth of exports is fundamental to the country's economic
recovery and development, which has, in the past, been handi-
capped by balance of payments difficulties, and such export
growth could be achieved by the agricultural sector more effec-
tively than by the other sectors, since, traditionally, it has
contributed an average of 80% of the total exports and further-
more enjoys comparative advantage for the production of world
traded agricultural commodities;
(b)  as the domestic agricultural sector provides nearly all of
the food consumed in the country, an abundant supply is
necessary to stabilize food prices, which constitute the most
important component of the consumers' cost of living index;
and
(c) over 40% of agricultural production is utilized by the agro-
industrial subsector, which, in turn, represents over 50% of
total industrial exports. Accordingly, Government strategy
seeks broadly to make suitable adjustments in taxation,
tariff and exchange rate policies which would help bring
output and input prices to international levels (para
1.18) and gradually to improve the productive basis of
the agricultural sector by promoting credit facilities
for financing investment, helping to clear fertile but
hitherto unused land, providing technical assistance and
augmenting facilities for agricultural marketing and
storage.
Sector Policies
1.17      In line with the announced general strategy, the agricultural policy,
including tax, credit, tariff, marketing and exchange rate policies, has under-
gone significant change since 1976. The ultimate objectives are to bring farm
product and input prices in line with international levels and to establish a



tax anG' credit system which will improve resource use and accelerate output
expansion. The agricultural sector has already begun to respond to these
changes by increasing production and exports of cereals and oilseeds.
Prices and Export Taxes
1.18      Relative prices were in the past highly distorted and unattractive
to producers, due to export taxes of the order of 40% for most agricultural
commodities, which resulted in domestic prices being, in general, about 40%
below international prices. Since mid-1976, differential exchange rates and
export taxes have been practically eliminated in the case of major export
commodities and reduced to levels not exceeding 10% for sunflower, peanuts and
linseed oil. From March to December 1976, real prices of agricultural products
increased by 37%, crop prices by 44%, and livestock prices by 23%. By the end
of 1976, most domestic price controls had been removed, and export marketing
transactions, which were previously handled by the National Grain Board and
the National Meat Board, were returned, to a great extent, to the private
sector.
Other Recent Policies Affecting the Sector
1.19      Regarding taxation, the most significant changes in the recent past
are: (a) great emphasis on the collection of taxes in general, especially at
the provincial level; (b) the creation of a temporary emergency sales tax of
4% on agricultural products, which started September 1, 1976 and is to remain
in effect until December 31, 1979 1/ (50% of this sales tax payment is
deductible as advance payment of the income tax imposed on profits attribut-
able to agricultural production); and (c) the introduction as of 1977 of a
land tax to be collected by all the provincial governments at a rate of 1% on
70% of the market value of land, which is to be assessed and adjusted annually
by the provincial governments.
1.20      Based on Government's tax collection estimates for the 1977 budget,
the tax burden to the agricultural sector is about 15% of the agricultural
GDP, as compared to about 13% in the case of the other private sectors of
the national economy. The estimates do not include income tax or the value
added tax (16x) paid by the sector for most farm inputs. Taxes now paid
by the sector, in order of importance to total revenue estimates, are:
1/   To compensate for the loss of revenues from export taxes reduced or
abolished during 1976.

Financial Policies
1.21      During the early part of 1977, the Government enacted two laws pro-
viding substantial positive changes in the national financing system. In
accordance with these laws, the Central Bank (CB) no longer provides redis-
counts to the banking system, deposits previously held only by CB have been
decentralized to the banking system, and financial institutions are now free
to fix interest rates for deposits and loans according to market conditions.
As of June 1977, subsidized negative interest rates have been eliminated,
and funds from all sources of lending are provided at positive rates, either
through periodical adjustment of principal outstanding in the case of invest-
ment loans or through nominal rates which incorporate projected inflation in
the case of short-term loans. Further details are provided in paragraphs 2.01
to 2.05.
E. Bank's Previous Financing in the Sector
1.22      On July 31, 1967, the Bank approved Loan 505-AR to help finance the
Balcarce Livestock Development Project. The project was appraised in February
1966 and became effective in October 1967. Project cost was US$39 million and
the loan amount was US$15.3 million. The original closing date was July 1972,
extended in late 1972 to July 1977 and recently to July 1979. By January 1,
1978, over 95% of loan funds were committed but Bank disbursement may be com-
pleted only by mid-1979 as farm investments financed by subloans extend over
three years.



- 10 -
1.23      The Balcarce Livestock Project provided long-term credit and techni-
cal assistance to mediumr and large-scale livestock producers and medium-term
credit to contractors for purchase of tractors and farm machinery in the
Balcarce region of the Buenos Aires province. Credit was provided through the
State Bank of Argentina (BNA) and technical assistance by a team of technicians
from the National Institute of Agricultural Technology (INTA) under the direc-
tion of a Project Director with headquarters at the Regional Agricultural
Experiment Station, Balcarce. The project also financed a study of soils and
drainage in the "Pampa Deprimida" within the project area and additional
equipment for the soils laboratory of INTA near Buenos Aires.
1.24      The rate of sublending under the project over time has been uneven.
For the first two to three years after effectiveness, very few subloans were
made. However, in 1970, 1971 and 1972, there was strong demand, which slack-
ened during 1972 and increased again in 1974. During 1975 and 1976, there
was very little demand and a number of producers cancelled their applications
and/or their subloans. Since the beginning of 1977, demand has again increased
markedly. The total number of subloans to farmers approved to date is 1,173,
compared to the appraisal estimate of 720. The average amount per subloan (in
current terms) has been US$23,000, compared to the appraisal estimate of
US$46,000.
1.25      In the initial years, demand was low because of (a) unfavorable
terms of trade for beef production, which applied from late 1966 through
1969; (b) availability of credit from BNA and other banks on terms at least as
favorable as those under the project and without supervision of investments;
and (c) hesitancy on the part of producers to accept subloans that required
adoption of a series of technical innovations incorporated in a plan for
development of the whole farm.
1.26      The greatly increased demand in the period 1970-74 resulted from
improvement in the terms of trade and the demonstration effect of the produc-
tivity increases achieved on the few farms financed by project subloans
earlier. The almost complete lack of demand in 1975 and 1976 was due to
several factors -- very adverse terms of trade due to reduced sales of beef
to the EEC market and the collapse of world prices; Government policies
which did not favor beef producers; and introduction of a system for index-
ing subloans. Since the change in Government in 1976, however, outlook and
terms of trade for beef producers have improved, largely as a result of
Government policies on taxes, prices and exchange rates. Also, as credit
policies have been changed to ensure that all credit in the country is at
positive real interest rates, subloans under the project have become rela-
tively more attractive.
1.27      Total physical investments financed under the project on partici-
pating farms have exceeded appraisal estimates. This applies to areas of
improved pasture; amount of fertilizer applied; number of cattle purchased;
fixed improvements installed such as fences, water facilities, corrals, and
hay sheds; and farm machinery. In 1973/74, INTA evaluated physical results
achieved on 154 farms for which subloans had been approved before April 30,
1971. Data were collected on various production parameters before farms had
entered the project and for the year 1972/73. The average results per farm
are summarized below:

1.28      The study compared farms in three groups according to size - less
than 500 ha, 500 to 1,500 ha, and over 1,500 ha - and in two groups according
to date of approval of subloans - 48 entering before June 30, 1970 and 106
between June 30, 1970 and April 30, 1971. Productivity increases were shown
to be greater on small farms. For beef production per hectare, the increases
were 83%, 60% and 42% for the small, medium and large farms, respectively.
The herds entering the project before June 30, 1971 showed a 63% increase in
beef production per hectare, compared to 46% for those entering after that
date. The evaluation did not include financial data.
1.29      The project has provided an intensive level of technical assistance
to sub-borrowers. The Project Unit comprises the Project Director, an Asso-
ciate Director, and about 24 technicians employed exclusively on the project.
Each technician makes several visits to a farm to assist in preparation of the
farm plan and subloan application, and, after subloan approval, to provide
technical assistance and to supervise investments and farm management. The
system has been effective in ensuring a high level of efficiency on the
individual farms, though it is not inexpensive in terms of trained manpower.
INTA receives 0.02% per annum on the outstanding balances of each subloan to
cover its costs.
1.30      During the whole period of project implementation, inflation has
been at a high level, accompanied by a marked depreciation of the Argentine
peso vis-a-vis the US dollar. The rate was US$1 to $a 1.9 at appraisal in
February 1966; $a 3.5 at the time of Board presentation in April 1967; about
$a 10 in early 1972; and about $a 500 in October 1977. From effectiveness of
the project until March 1973, interest rates on subloans increased from 14% to
21%, without indexation, but from then until January 1978, all new subloans
approved were made on the basis of a 6% interest rate on principal outstanding
and adjusted each six months according to the index of cattle prices at the
Liniers market (Buenos Aires) or the cost-of-living index, whichever was the
lower. This indexing system also resulted in negative real interest rates,
but it was an improvement over the previous one. As of February 1978, at
Government's request,   the system was again modified so that the adjustment
would be made on the basis of the General Wholesale Price Index, which allows
the 6% interest rate to be positive in real terms.
1.31      The soils and drainage study financed under the project covered the
"Pampa Deprimida," which is a large, low lying area in the southeast of Buenos



,2 
Aires province that has serious drainage and salinity problems and overlaps
the project area for on-farm investments. The study provides for extensive
soils surveys in the field, with relevant laboratory analysis, and for soil
and lana capability mapping of Leie whole area on a reconnaissance scale and
for some areas on a semi-detailed or detailed scale. The study is virtually
comp'eL_ but some of thle maps and reports have yet to be published. The
study provides a useful basis for land use and farm planning of the area
and indicates that a major public investment program for main drainage
canals is not warranted. Minor on-farm drainage works are required in some
areas, but a large proportion of the area is suitable for pasture improvement
in its present state.
II. THE BANKING SYSTEM AND AGRICULTURAL CREDIT
A. Recent Financial Legislation
Role of Central Bank
2.01      Since June 1977, the Argentine banking system and its monetary and
credit policies have been governed by a new law -- Reform of the Financial
Entities -- which drastically changed the previous banking system law of
August 1973. The new law lessens Central Bank's role in administrative
and banking operations that are not related to normal central banking
functions, while increasing its powers as superintendent of all financial
intermediaries and controller of the money supply and credit.
Decentralization of Deposits
2.02      Till recently, the banking system worked under the strict control of
CB, which, in accordance with Law No. 20520 (August 1, 1973), held all deposits
raised by the banking system and determined the use of these resources on the
basis of national priorities. The individual banks acted merely as CB's
agents for collection and administration of deposits, receiving for the
service commissions and various rediscounting facilities (generally based on
deposits collected by them) to  finance specified economic sectors.  However,
the acute financial needs of the Treasury limited CB's capacity to provide
adequate funds to the private sector. In order to restore to the financial
system the necessary flexibility and operational freedom, deposits have been
decentralized, doing away with the concept of "nationalized deposits."
2.03      The key credit regulatory instrument of CB, which controls the
lending capacity of the financial institutions, is a legal reserve against
deposits required to be held by the institutions. This reserve (encaje)
has presently been fixed at 45%. The CB levies a charge on the balance of
the current deposits to encourage stable deposits and to discourage current
accounts.



- 13 -
Limitation of Rediscounting Facilities
2.04      With the release of deposits, most rediscounting facilities were
withdrawn. The only facilities continued by the CB pertain to such activities
as promotion of exports, lending for housing, land mortgage loans and agricul-
tural emergency (e.g. droughts, floods). The current CB policy is to control
only the volume of credit but not to interfere in the sectoral allocation of
funds by the ba2king system unless it appears unbalanced.
Freedom of Interest Rates
2.05      Financial institutions are now free to fix active and passive
interest rates according to market conditions. It is assumed that, through
the interplay of forces of supply and demand for funds, positive interest
rates will be established which will also reflect the risks and costs of the
institutions. This decision has opened the way to an increasing number of
possibilities for receiving deposits and investing proceeds at rates not
subject to CB regulations. The purpose of this measure is to encourage
the mobilization of deposits and to direct the funds to the most profitable
activities.
B. Structure of the Banking System
2.06      The new law classifies Argentinian financial institutions as follows:
(a) commercial banks;
(b) investment banks;
(c) land mortgage banks;
(d) finance companies;
(e) savings and loans associations for housing and other fixed
assets; and
(f) credit associations.
2.07      While commercial banks can undertake all banking operations (unless
specifically prohibited), investment banks can receive only term deposits,
issue bonds and extend medium- and long-term credit (short-term loans are
permitted only to complement investment credit). Land mortgage banks can
issue mortgage bonds and make long-term loans for the purchase, extension and
maintenance of urban and rural properties. Finance companies can engage
mainly in activities connected with investments in bonds and/or stocks and are
subject to Central Bank regulations on liquidity, solvency, and minimum equity
capital requirements.
2.08      Commercial banks largely dominate the financial system regulated by
CB. There are about 110 commercial banks, of which one, BNA, is entirely
owned by the Government; 28 provincial banks, which are either owned entirely
by the provincial governments or with some participation by the private



- 14 -
sector; and 89 private banks, of which 18 are considered foreign-owned banks 1/.
Under the new financial law, all banks (including provincial banks) are author-
ized to operate on a countrywide basis and many also contract credits from
foreign and international institutions.
C. Agricultural Credit
General
2.09      Loans issued in 1975 are analyzed with regard to the type of insti-
tution, official or private, and the length of repayment term in Annex 1,
Table 3. The table shows the dominant importance of short-term loans, which
accounted for 82% of the total loans made by the banking system in 1975 and
91% for private banks alone. Official banks accounted for as much as 78% of
the total lending by the banking system in 1975.
2.10      Loans for agriculture are extended mainly by official banks (BNA
and provincial banks), which disbursed 76% of loans to agriculture in 1975.
Banco Ganadero and Banco Cooperativo Agrario are the private banks most active
in this sector, 82% of such lending being short term. BNA is the main source
of medium- and long-term loans, and the Provincial Government Bank of Buenos
Aires (BPB) is enlarging its involvement in development finance. Annex 1,
Table 4, provides further details of the agricultural lending of the banking
system.
Current Interest Rates
2.11      Deposits.  Now that the interest rates have been freed and CB redis-
counting facilities are available only under exceptional circumstances, banks
are actively competing to attract deposits. Interest rates on fixed-term
deposits are based on short-term projected inflation and therefore continually
change. To provide an idea of the great variation produced in the course of
about a four-month period, the rates paid by BNA (and similar rates paid by
most commercial banks in June and October 1977) are shown below:
Annual Rate Percentage
For Periods of                            Paid in Advance
June 1977 October 1977
60 days                                79           116
90 days                                84           121
120 days                                85           123
150 days                                86           126
180 days                                88           131
1/   More than 30% of whose capital is owned by non-residents.



- 15 -
2.12      Loans.  Active interest on loans up to 180 days is generally payable
in advance, and rates ranged from 125% to 140% in October 1977. For loans
repayable after 180 days, BNA and the BPB (the main institutions involved
in such financing) apply two different formulae. The former charges an
interest rate of 6% p.a. on the outstanding capital adjusted on the basis of
the General Wholesale Price Index, while the latter charges a floating rate,
which is reviewed every quarter according to the market conditions. In June
1977, the rate was 100% 1/. In both institutions, interest is paid at maturity,
in accordance with CB regulations. BNA and BPB, the two principal commercial
banks in Argentina, are described in detail in Chapter III.
III. MAIN PROJECT EXECUTING AGENCIES
A. Policy, Coordination and Supervision Agencies
3.01      Under the Argentine Government structure, the overall economic
policy is the responsibility of the Ministry of Economy. Specific responsi-
bilities for the main sectors are vested in 11 State Secretariats, which
operate under a system of authority and responsibility as delegated by the
Minister of Economy. The agricultural sector is the responsibility of the
State Secretariat for Agriculture and Livestock (SEAG). The State Secretariat
of Economic Programing and Coordination, besides coordinating inter-sectoral
action and being responsible for external financing, is the channel between
Government, CB and the financial entities in matters related to credit and
other financial transactions.
3.02      The SEAG is directly responsible for policy and technical aspects
concerning the agricultural sector, working with the agricultural secretariats
of the provincial governments. It is divided into four subsecretariats:
Agrarian Economy, Agriculture, Livestock and Renewable Natural Resources.
The Subsecretary for Agrarian Economy is mainly responsible for the economic
aspects of the sector, for coordination, and for the preparation of specific
agricultural programs and projects, including the proposed agricultural credit
project. The main functions of the Subsecretariats for Agriculture and for
Livestock are related to plant and animal sanitation and other regulatory
activities, and the Subsecretary for Renewable Resources is charged with
responsibility for controlling resources, particularly forests and fisheries.
1/   During 1977, the inflation rate measured by the variation of the General
Wholesale Price Index was 150%. Government's goal is to reduce this rate
by about one-half during calendar year 1978.



16 -
B. Technical Assistance Agencies
3t03      Agricultural research and extension services provided by the Federal
Government have been the responsibility of INTA since its creation in 1956 as
a decentralized agency, with close ties to the SEAG. Its main financing
resources come from an ad valorem tax of 2% levied on all agricultural exports,
which amounts to about 0.5% of the total value of agricultural production in
the country.  INTA is directed by a six-member board whose president and
vice-president are appointed by the Secretary of Agriculture and Livestock.
Other members represent farmers' associations. INTA administers the National
Center of Agricultural Research located in Castelar, seven regional centers
with some 40 regional and specialized experiment stations, and 220 extension
offices throughout the country.
3.04      During the past decade, INTA has primarily carried out research work
to develop high yielding and disease-resistant varieties of grain and oilseed
crops.  In recent years, emphasis has been put on breeding varieties for re-
sponse to fertilizer. Substantial research efforts have also been concentrated
on the control of weeds such as Johnson Grass and Bermuda Grass, which have
become a serious problem in certain areas of the Pampas region and are spread-
ing to other parts of the country. Regarding livestock production, research
and extension have been directed for many years, mainly in the Balcarce area,
to establishment of improved pastures and efficient management practices.
3.05      As a result of research and extension work by INTA and the private
sector during the past 20 years, there is now a considerable amount of modern
but under-used technology. There is general agreement that the failure to
apply available technology has been due to past Government policies which
adversely affected agriculture's terms of trade. However, there are already
tangible indications that the new policies that have lifted the price of
agricultural products to international levels (about 40% until 1975) have
provided encouragement for a wider adoption of the technology and improved
inputs that can be supplied by INTA and private sector enterprises.
3.06      A significant feature of Argentina's technical assistance system is
that, apart from official extension work, private technical assistance paid
for by farmers has been growing in recent years, encouraged by the changed
agricultural policy. The main sources of such assistance are the 135 Regional
Consortium of Agricultural Research Groups (CREA), which are united under a
federation known as the National Association of CREAS Groups (AACREA), a
central coordinating and technical assistance body. A group typically has
eight to 18 farmer members who, together, contract for on-farm technical and
management advisory services from one or more technicians and pay the costs
for the services. Other important sources of private technical assistance are
the agricultural cooperatives, which, even though their principal activity is
the marketing of farm products, are more and more including in their services
the provision of technical assistance to their farmer members. As of October
1977, the Argentine Federation of Agricultural Cooperatives (FACA) employed 80
professionals, most of them agronomists. Suppliers of improved and certified
seed, chemicals and machinery also account for a great deal of the technical



- 17 -
assistance provided by the private sector. Most of the technicians from that
sector have either worked for, or received training at, INTA and keep close
contact with their research stations.
C. Credit Agencies
The State Bank of Argentina (BNA)
3.07      BNA, the most important financial institution of the country's
banking system, is classified as a commercial bank, but its charter requires
it, among other things, to support agricultural production and primary process-
ing of the produce and, in general, to supply credit to support the needs of
trade, industry and the country's other economic activities. BNA has, histor-
ically, accounted for around half of the banking system's lending to the
agricultural sector, and its share of medium- and long-term credit has been
around 80% of the total. BNA was established in 1891 and became a state-owned
bank in 1904.
3.08      Organization and Management.  BNA is governed by a Board of Directors,
comprising a president, a vice-president and nine directors, representing
various economic sectors and regions, all appointed by the Government. The
president, vice-president and directors serve for indefinite renewable terms
of four years. The Board of Directors determines the general operational
policy of the institution, formulates by-laws and regulations, and approves
annual budget and financial statements. One of the directors is responsible
particularly for agricultural credit. The day-to-day administration is
the responsibility of the general manager, and a Government representative
ensures that BNA acts in accordance with its charter, law and accounting
system. BNA's organization chart is shown in Annex 1, Chart 1.
3.09      The BNA has 572 branch offices all over the country, plus branches
in neighboring countries and in the main international financial centers. The
branch offices work under the supervision of 20 zonal managers who are respon-
sible for proper development and operations of the branch offices. BNA employs
about 25,000 people, including about 3,900 specialist staff mostly at branches.
Selection for recruitment is based on technical and psychological tests, and
new employees undergo two-month training courses. Salaries are in line with
those of other banking institutions. There are 87 agricultural engineers at
headquarters responsible for feasibility studies, preparation of farm plans
and supervision of loans.
3.10      Accounts and Auditing.  Accounts are kept adequately by branches and
are centralized at headquarters in Buenos Aires, supported by an electronic
data processing system. Internal auditing is conducted by inspectors, respon-
sible to the Board of Directors, and external auditing is carried out by the
Central Bank.
3.11      Resources.  Until June 1977, BNA resources consisted mainly of CB
rediscounts, borrowing from external financing entities and its capital and
reserves. As of July 1977, CB, in accordance with the new financial and



- 18 -
banking law, released the previously centralized deposits (para 2.02) and
withdrew practical-ly all rediscounting facilities (para 2.04). Therefore,
as of that date, BNA resources have consisted mainly of deposits from the
private and official sector (about $a 268 billion), borrowings from external
sources (about $a 33 billion), and its own capital and reserves (about $a 37
billion). BNA used to be the only banking institution entitled to receive
deposits from the National Government agencies (about $a 25 billion, to
December 31, 1976) but this monopoly ended in September 1976.
3.12      BNA has been the financial agent of the Government for borrowing from
the Bank, USAID, IDB and other foreign and international agencies. USAID pro-
vided loans for the construction of private grain silos but it is no longer
active in financing agriculture in Argentina.
3.13      Use of Resources.  As of the end of December 1976, BNA's loan port-
folio amounted to $a 176 billion, of which about 45% were loans to the agricul-
tural sector and 55% to the industrial and commercial sectors. Agricultural
loans, which decreased from 32.8% of total portfolio in 1974 to 27.3% in 1975,
rose to 45.1% at the end of 1976. Such lending is for financing farm operat-
ing costs and for the purchase of tractors, machinery and vehicles. Short-
term loans (up to three years), which formed 85% of the portfolio in 1975,
declined to about 70% in 1976. The proportion of medium-term loans (three
to five years) increased from 11% in 1975 to 26% in 1976, while long-term
loans (more than five years) were around 4% over the last two years.
3.14      Lending Policy.  BNA's lending policy follows the guidelines estab-
lished in the Central Bank circular of May 1977, which states that lending
should be directed to financing investments in the production, marketing and
consumption of goods and services required to meet both domestic demand and
export requirements in order to achieve high output and employment levels.
The BNA carries out all banking operations with the private and cooperative
sector, but it cannot make advances to either the national or provincial
Governments or to the municipalities.
3.15      Lending Procedures.  Loans are generally granted on the basis of
applications made for specific purposes and in accordance with strictly
defined loan regulations. Credit limits are fixed mainly on the basis of the
personal knowledge of the borrower available to the BNA loan officer and/or
branch manager involved and on empirical assessment of his repayment capacity.
Generally, the BNA provides 60% to 80% of project costs and about 70% of the
net worth of the borrower and of value of collateral. Land mortgage is seldom
required, even for long-term loans, and chattel mortgage is widely used.
3.16      BNA bases its lending operations on a centralized supervisory process
(guidelines issued by headquarters) and a system of decentralized implementa-
tion through its network of branches. Lending programs are reviewed and estab-
lished annually and approved by the Board of Directors. Branch managers can
approve loans up to $a 19 million and zonal managers from over $a 19 million
up to $a 26 million. These limits, however, are reviewed frequently because
of inflation.



- 19 -
3.17      Loan Collection.  As BNA does not keep statistics on loan collection
in relation to amounts to be recovered, it is possible to show the arrears
only in relation to the total portfolio, as follows:
Loan Portfolio as of December 31
Year             Arrears        Portfolio         Percentage
------$a million-------
1972               139             8,841             1.57
1973               160            15,304             1.05
1974               213            22,683             0.94
1975               387            50,823             0.76
1976               556           176,462             0.32
These figures exclude loans written off, which amounted to $a 6.3 million and
$a 2.8 million in 1975 and 1976, respectively. They do, however, show improve-
ment in loan collection and a low level of arrears. Although a full picture
of loan collection is not available because of the lack of information on
renewed loans, it is apparent that BNA's loan recovery performance is good,
which reflects, in part, its conservative and cautious policy.
3.18      Financial Position.  The financial statements of BNA for 1974,
1975, 1976, are shown in Annex 1, Tables 5 and 6. As of December 31, 1976,
BNA's total assets amounted to $a 481 billion and its net worth was $a 37
million. BNA's financial performance is satisfactory. Net profits have been
of the order of 10% of gross income in the last two years, compared with about
6% in 1974. On the income side, the share of interest received and commissions
on deposits has steadily declined since 1974 due to high inflation, while
income from exchange operations and commissions received have increased. On
the expenditure side, financial and administrative expenses have also declined
in relative terms. For the future, BNA will have to demonstrate its capability
to maintain and possibly improve its earning capacity under the conditions of
more severe competition but its past performance would indicate that this
mature and sound institution will be able to maintain its record of profit-
ability.
Provincial Bank of Buenos Aires (BPB)
3.19      Provincial banks are headquartered in each provincial capital.  They
are autonomous bodies essentially owned by the respective provincial govern-
ments, although some of them are partly owned by private shareholders ("mixtos").
BPB is the largest of the official provincial banks and the second largest
bank in the country after BNA. It was established in 1890, and covers mostly
Buenos Aires Province and the Federal Capital. It has a network of 264 branches,
of which 150 are in the province, and employs about 15,000 people. According
to its law of incorporation, BPB includes a banking section and a land mortgage
section ("Credito Hipotecario"), each of which has separate equity capital,
reserves, assets and liabilities and submits separate financial statements to
the Government bodies. BPB is the financial agent of the Provincial Government,



- 20 -
atl:]  Lhis capacity, collects taxes in the Federal Capital and in the
Province and ensures the public debt service. The bank is directed by a Board
of Directors appointed by the Provincial Government. The Minister of Economy
of the Province is the intermediary between BPB and the Provincial Government.
3.20      The banking section is responsible for agricultural loans, which
cover mainly short-term loans to finance production costs (up to 270 days) and
medium-term loans not exceeding five or six years for livestock, silos, land
clearing and rural electrification. A floating interest rate, adjusted quar-
terly by CB, has been used for medium- and long-term loans, and collaterals
consist mainly of chattel mortgage.
3.21      BPB is a sound commercial bank that plays an important role in the
most important agricultural province and it has plans to expand its activities
outside the province of Buenos Aires. Moreover, its board and management
are aggressive and interested in participating for the first time in an agri-
cultural development program financed by an international organization, as
would be the case with the proposed agricultural credit project.
IV. THE PROJECT
A. Introduction
4.01      The Government of Argentina has requested a Bank loan to help
finance an agricultural credit project that would provide medium- and long-
term subloans for (a) on-farm investments for livestock and crop production;
(b) a weed control program; and (c) a land clearing program. The project
presented to the Government for Bank appraisal was prepared by a team con-
sisting of representatives from SEAG, INTA, and BNA. An FAO/Bank Cooperative
Program mission and Bank staff assisted in project preparation.
B. Brief Description
4.02      The project would finance, over a three-year commitment period,
medium- and long-term agricultural credit to finance on-farm development
investments for livestock and crop production in selected areas of the Pampean
and the Mesopotamian regions; weed control in an extensive area of the Pampean
region, now heavily infested with weed; and land clearing in the northern
provinces of the country. The project would help implement Government's
policies aimed at accelerating the growth of agricultural production for
export to overcome the traditionally recurring balance of payments difficulties
that have hampered Argentina's economic growth during most of the post-war
period. Specifically, the project is designed to accomplish the following
objectives:



- 21 -
(a) increase the productivity of ranches and farms dedicated
to the production of livestock and agricultural products
in the Pampean and Mesopotamian regions;
(b) restore the productive capacity of an extensive area of
the Pampean region, which is now heavily infested with
Johnson grass and Bermuda grass; and
(c) extend the country's cropping and pasture area by clearing
substantial portions of unproductive wooded land in the
northern provinces.
4.03      The project would provide credit and technical assistance to far-
mers and ranchers through participating banks on the basis of technically and
financially viable agricultural investment plans. About 4,500 subloans would
be made over the three-year commitment period, and, since most farm plans
require two- to three-year investment periods, the Bank would disburse over
a five-year period. The main inputs to be financed by subloans would be
improved pastures, fertilizers, fencing, water facilities, breeding cattle,
herbicides and equipment, land clearing machinery and equipment, contractors'
custom work and technical assistance.
4.04      The project would be administered by a committee, consisting of
representatives of the Secretary of Agriculture and Livestock, the President
of INTA and the President of BNA. A project coordinator, under the committee,
would be responsible for day-to-day tasks and would be the liaison officer
between the Bank, the Government and other participating parties. Project
funds would be channelled to beneficiaries through BNA and some selected
provincial banks on the basis of subsidiary loan agreements with the Govern-
ment, which would be the borrower. BNA would be responsible for handling
Bank reimbursements to all participating banks. Technical assistance would
be provided by INTA and private technicians authorized by the Project
Coordinator and trained by INTA.
C. Detailed Features
Project Area and Scope
4.05      The project area (Map IBRD 13337) includes mainly selected areas
in 13 of the country's 23 provinces. The on-farm development component would
be implemented mostly in the central and southeast areas of the province of
Buenos Aires, northeast of the province of La Pampa, and in several areas in
the provinces of Corrientes, Entre Rios and San Luis. The selected area
comprises about 38 million ha (18% of the country's farming area), where about
120,000 farmers are dedicated to livestock and crop production. About half of
this area is within the Pampean region, which accounts for more than 70% of
the country's cattle herd as well as for most of the grain production. The
"non-Pampean" areas, mainly the Mesopotamian region, are of less importance
today, but have a great potential for the expansion of livestock and crop
production. The weed control component would be carried out as a pilot



- 22 -
project in the counties of Pergamino and Salto in the province of Buenos Aires
and in General Lopez in the province of Santa Fe. These are the most severely
weed-infested areas in the country, and active local committees are already
working on the problem. The land clearing component would be implemented in
selected areas of nine provinces now covered by about 14 million ha of woods
and forests, of which over 3 million ha are unproductive and on soils suitable
for farming and ranching activities. The provinces in which land clearing
would take place would be: Chaco, Formosa, Cordoba, Entre Rios, Santiago
del Estero, Tucuman, Salto and Jujuy. Farm models are presented in Annex
1, Tables 7 to 17.
On-farm Development
4.06      Under this component, credit and technical assistance would be
provided for development on about 1,550 farms. The area of this component
would include that of the on-going Balcarce Livestock Development Project in
the eastern portion of Buenos Aires province, the provinces of Entre Rios,
Corrientes and San Luis and the northeastern portion of La Pampa province.
Environmental conditions range from humid temperature in Buenos Aires province,
to humid sub-tropical in Corrientes province to semi-arid in San Luis and
La Pampa provinces. Because of these differences and the varying marketing
opportunities in the different zones, there is a wide range of production
possibilities and, hence, of the investments which might be financed.
4.07      In the Buenos Aires province, the on-farm investments and the tech-
nology introduced are expected to be similar to those under the Balcarce
Project, where they have proved successful. They would involve establishment
of improved pastures comprising grasses and legumes and, in suitable areas,
the growing of crops such as wheat, linseed, sunflower and oats in rotation
with improved pastures. This portion of the project area can be broadly
divided into two zones, one near the coast, known as the Cuenca del Salado,
which has limited potential for agriculture because of severe drainage prob-
lems but is suitable for improved pastures, and the other, the mixed farming
zone, which has fertile well drained soils with considerable agricultural
potential.
4.08      The southern and central portion of Entre Rios province has poten-
tial comparable to that of the Buenos Aires province for mixed agricultural
and livestock production, using improved pastures. The northern portion of
the province is less suitable for production of grain crops, and investments
in this zone would generally be for an extensive type of livestock operation.
4.09      Corrientes province is in a humid, sub-tropical environment, with a
predominantly summer rainfall ranging from 1,000 to 1,500 mm annually. Tech-
nology for establishment and management of improved pastures is less well
developed than in Buenos Aires and Entre Rios provinces. However, it has
been shown that Pangola grass pastures can be established and that they can
substantially increase productivity. More recently, promising results have
been obtained in the southern portion of the province with various species of
tropical legumes. Because of less well-developed technology and a more
traditional outlook by livestock producers, a much smaller demand for subloans



- 23 -
is expected in this province than elsewhere. In both Entre Rios and Corrientes
provinces, the project would cover only medium and large farms as credit is
already available for the relatively smaller farmers under an on-going IDB
project.
4.10      In San Luis province and the portion of La Pampa province included
in the project, rainfall ranges from only 400 to 650 mm annually. Within
these areas, particularly in La Pampa province, there are zones suitable for
mixed livestock and agriculture. The principal crops are wheat, sorghum and
malting barley. It is expected that many more subloans would be made in La
Pampa than in San Luis province.
Weed Control
4.11      The project would finance about 2,015 farmers in a program to
control two weeds -- Johnson grass (Sorghum halepense) and Bermuda grass
(Cynodon dactylon) -- in the Pampean region, which is considered Argentina's
most fertile agricultural area. As a result of the ever increasing infesta-
tion, yields of the most important crops of the area -- maize, soybean and
wheat -- have been seriously reduced. Under the project, direct technical
assistance would be provided to the sub-borrowers to insure proper assessment,
planning, timing and follow-up, which is essential for the success of the
program. Existing local experience with a number of well tried weedicide
materials is adequate to enable control programs for Johnson grass and
Bermuda grass to be prepared as a part of farm plans for participating banks
financing. Testing by INTA of promising new materials, only recently
available locally, is in progress and recommendations for their use will be
made when the appropriate technology has been adequately proven.
4.12      Johnson Grass.  The Johnson grass control project area would be in
the counties of Salto, Pergamino and probably Rojas, considered to be the most
heavily infested part of Buenos Aires province. Two types of farms would be
financed: about 1,190 field crop farms, averaging 100 ha in size, and about
500 combination crop and livestock farms, averaging 170 ha in size. Under
the project, crop farmers are expected to summer fallow 60 ha of their most
severely infested land following the wheat harvest. During the fallow period,
infestation would be reduced by herbicide application and tillage, repeating
the procedure the following season if the infestation was not sufficiently
reduced to allow summer crops to be produced. In the areas where the infesta-
tion was sufficiently reduced, soybeans would be planted and herbicides and
mechanical cultivation would further reduce the infestation. Maize would
follow the soybeans during the next two summer growing seasons, with herbicides
and intensive cultivation to continue weakening the weed and to prevent rein-
festation. In the farms which have livestock, pastures would be similarly
improved to help weaken and control infestation. Investments on crop farms
would primarily be in herbicides, weed control operations and labor, and a
herbicide sprayer (for tractor), with the investment per farm amounting
to about US$15,410. Investments on a combination crop and livestock farm
would, in addition, include fertilizer, livestock watering facilities, fences,
and a bull for herd improvement. The investment per farm would be about
US$23,440.



- 24 -
4.i3      Bermuda Grass.  The 325 beneficiaries in the Bermuda grass (Cynodon-
dactylon) project area would be primarily combination crop and livestock far-
mers operating, on average, about 275 ha each. A program similar to that in
the Johason grass area would be followed on 100 ha of each beneficiary's farm,
using winter wheat or pasture to weaken the Bermuda grass. Then, during the
summer fallow, herbicides and mechanical tillage would reduce the infestation
and help control weed growth. There is some overlap of the Johnson grass and
Bermuda grass infested areas, but the general project area for Bermuda grass
control would be in the Rufino area of Santa Fe province. The general crop-
ping pattern consists of wheat, sorghum and pasture rotation. Under this
part of the weed control project, as in the Johnson grass portion, both
cropping and livestock production would be intensified to weaken the weeds,
and improved cropping techniques, improved pastures, and efficient livestock
management would be employed to help prevent re-infestation. Investments
would primarily be in weed control operations and labor, herbicides, livestock
water facilities, mechanization, development of 40 ha of improved pastures,
including fertilizer; fences; and two bulls for herd improvement. The
investment per farm over a three-year period would be about US$27,625.
Land Clearing
4.14      The land clearing component is expected to benefit about 955 farmers
producing crops and livestock and bring under cultivation about 90,000 ha of
fertile but presently unproductive land under light forest cover of low qual-
ity and production. The general project area is located in nine provinces in
the central north of Argentina. The principal crops would be sorghum, sun-
flower, soybean and cotton, and livestock enterprises would be primarily
cow-calf operations in which the male calves are reared to 380 to 420 kg for
slaughter. The forests to be cleared are of generally low quality and farming
is interspersed in previously cleared areas. In view of its costly nature,
land clearing meeting the requisite standards of technical efficiency has been
largely confined to large-scale, financially strong enterprises. Therefore,
to enable small farmers and their cooperatives who lack sufficient resources
of their own to participate in such efforts to extend Argentina's agricultural
frontier, the project would provide credit to smaller farmers to cover the
cost of hiring contractors to do the work. Subloans to larger farmers and
cooperatives would cover the cost of purchasing equipment to clear their own
land and, after work is completed, and also do contract work for other farmers.
This component would introduce efficient land clearing methods, and, in the
case of larger farmers and cooperatives, take advantage of economies of scale.
4.15      About 820 smaller farmers whose holdings average about 350 ha are
expected to contract for land clearing. Most of these participants have 60%
of their land in crops and pastures, together with a herd of about 100 head
of mixed cattle. The average size subloan would be about US$21,000 to cover
the cost of the clearing, plowing, and disking of 40 ha and the cost of wire
and labor for the installation of about 1,000 meters of five-wire fence. The
investment would be primarily for land clearing by contract (95%) and fencing
(5%).
4.16      About 135 units - individual large farmers, cooperatives or other
farmer groups - are expected to buy 140- to 200-hp crawler tractors equipped
with bulldozers plus land clearing equipment. The sub-borrowers would clear



- 25 -
about 425 ha of their 2,000-ha holdings, working about 3,400 tractor hours in
three years, and, since the useful productive life of the machinery is esti-
mated at 10,000 hours, they would also provide contract services to smaller
farmers. Most of the participating farmers have 30% (600 ha) of their farms
in crops and pastures. The average size herd is about 400 head of cattle of
various ages, including about 160 head of brood cows. Investments would
primarily be made in tractors and equipment for land clearing, operating
expenses for 3,375 hours of operation, and 5 km of fences. The typical
investment would be about US$267,000.
4.17      The following table shows the type and average size of investments
expected to be made under the three project components:

Technical Assistance
4.18      In accordance with recent Government policy, technical assist-
ance would not be provided cost-free by Government entities to commercial
farmers. The Government, however, has decided to establish a system under
which official entities, mainly INTA, would be financed for the costs of
research, training of technicians, and preparation of guidelines for farm
plans for specific areas or commodities. Considering that technical
assistance is mainly required for the preparation of farm plans and super-
vision of the on-farm development and the weed control project components, an
amount equivalent to 2% of the lending program cost has been included to be
provided through subloans as an additional input. It has been estimated that,
since many farmers actually use the services of private technicians, less than
half of the sub-borrowers would require credit for this purpose. Funds are
also provided to finance reinforcement of INTA's staff and to purchase the
transportation and office equipment needed to allow staff to carry out its
responsibilties under the project. In addition, the project would provide
funds to finance salaries and equipment for the office of the project coor-
dinator. At negotiations, a detailed plan on the lines described above for
the provision and financing of technical assistance required under the project
was presented to the Bank, and its main components have been included in the
Loan Agreement.
D.  Project Cost
4.19      Total project cost, including contingencies, is estimated at US$161.7
million, of which US$60.0 million, or 37%, represents foreign exchange costs
net of import duties and taxes. Project costs have been estimated on the
basis of June/July 1977 prices and a price contingency amounting to 23% of
baseline costs, expressed in dollars, has been added. The price contingency
is based on the assumptions for the phasing of investments over a five-year
period (Annex 1, Table 18) and expected price increases of 9% per annum from
July to December 1977, 7% during 1978, 6.5% during 1979 and 6% thereafter.
Project costs by main investment items are shown in Annex 1, Table 19.
Project costs by investment category are summarized in the table below and
further details are in the Project File (Annex 2).

/1 Government's contribution.
4.21      The proposed Bank loan of US$60.0 million would finance the entire
foreign exchange cost, which has been estimated at 37% of the total project
cost. Project beneficiaries would finance US$31.6 million, representing about
20% of the total, and US$70.1 million, or 43%, would be provided by the parti-
cipating banks. The Bank loan would be made to the Government at the Bank
lending rate prevailing at the time of loan approval, for a term of 13 years,
including four vears of grace. The Government would assume the foreign
exchange risk and on-lend the proceeds of the loan to the participating
banks, who, in turn, would make subloans to project beneficiaries. Lending
terms and conditions between Government and participating banks and between
participating banks and project beneficiaries would be set in the subsidiary
loan agreements (para 5.10) to be entered into by the Ministry of Economy
(Government) and each participating bank.

F. Procurement
4.23      The investment items to be financed through project subloans would
be procured by approximately 4,520 project sub-borrowers over a five-year
investment period. Since the items to be procured are varied and would not be
suitable for bulk procurement through international competitive bidding, pro-
curement would be through local, established commercial agents, who represent
a broad spectrum of international suppliers.  Sub-borrowers would purchase
items of their choice. Vehicles and equipment related to the technical
assistance project component would be varied and individual orders are not
expected to exceed the equivalent of US$100,000; therefore, these items would
be procured through local competitive bidding procedures, which are satisfac-
tory to the Bank. Major suppliers of land clearing machines, farm tractors,
equipment and agricultural chemical products from Bank member countries are
represented in Argentina and service is satisfactory throughout the project
area. There are no foreign exchange restrictions on the importation of any
of the items financed under the project. Most of the locally manufactured
agricultural inputs are sold at prices that are competitive with foreign
manufactured items. Import duties for items not manufactured in the country
are of the order of 5% to 10% and those for imported products that compete
with locally manufactured items are being gradually lowered from an average
of 37% to levels expected not to exceed an average of 25%.
G. Disbursements
4.24      The Bank would disburse over a period of five years:
(a) 46% of the amounts previously disbursed by the parti-
cipating banks for subloans to project beneficiaries
making investments related to: (i) on-farm development;
(ii) weed control; and (iii) land clearing project compo-
nents, for a total of US$59.2 million.
(b) 100% of the foreign expenditures for direct imports,
or 50% of local expenditures, representing the esti-
mated foreign exchange cost, for vehicles and equipment
related to the technical assistance project component,
for a total of US$800,000.
4.25      The Bank would reimburse for the project subloans made by parti-
cipating banks to project beneficiaries against statements of expenditures
which would be certified and documented by each participating bank. The
documentation for the expenditures would not be submitted to the Bank, but
would be retained by the participating bank for inspection during the course
of Bank supervision missions. All other disbursements would be made against
normal documentation. With participating banks' commitments extending over
a three-year period and with up to three-year periods of on-farm investments
by sub-borrowers, it is estimated that Bank disbursement would take place
over a five-year period.



- 29 -
4.26      Argentina, with Internatinal Monetary Fund encouragement, is follow-
ing a policy of gliding parity exchange rate adjustments. Therefore, to
cover fully the foreign exchange costs of the project, Bank disbursements to
reimburse expenditures of the participating banks under the project lending
program would be made at the exchange rate prevailing at the mid-point of the
month in which local disbursements are made rather than at the exchange rate
existing on the day the Bank disbursement is actually made.
4.27      The estimated schedule of Bank disbursements, assuming that the date
of effectiveness of the proposed loan would be no later than August 30, 1978,
would be as follows:
Bank FY              1979        1980         1981        1982       1983

V. PROJECT IMPLEMENTATION
A. Organization and Management
Administration
5.01      The project would be administered by a Project Committee (PC)
composed of representatives of, inter alia, the SEAG, BNA and INTA,
which are the three main entities directly responsible for implementation of
the different project components. Committee members would be qualified staff
members of their respective institutions, selected and appointed by the
Secretary of the SEAG, the President of BNA and the President of INTA. The
Committee's main functions would be to supervise and coordinate project
implementation, and its president would also serve as the borrower's official
representative in dealing with the Bank in all technical and economic matters
related to the project. Establishment of the Committee would be a condition
of loan effectiveness.
Management
5.02      A project coordinator, under the Project Committee, would assist,
supervise and coordinate the participating entities in carrying out project
activities. He would also serve as the liaison officer between the Bank, the
Government and other participating entities. The project coordinator would be
a qualified professional with experience in agricultural development activi-
ties, selected and appointed by the Committee. Assurances on this were
obtained at negotiations; the appointment of the project coordinator would
be a condition of loan effectiveness.



- 30 -
Technical Assistance
5.03      In accordance with Government policy, sub-borrowers would be free
to choose their own farm planners and follow-up advisers from INTA private
consultants, cooperatives, farmers' associations such as CREAs groups, and
credit institutions. However, INTA would also (a) train participating tech-
nical advisers; (b) prepare technical guidelines establishing standards and
methodology for the preparation of farm plans; and (c) supervise the technical
services provided by consultants.
Control of Land Clearing
5.04      The Provincial Secretariat for Agriculture (SAP) in each province
has its land clearing laws and by-laws, which are satisfactory to the Bank, and
is responsible for the conservation aspect of land clearing operations. Thus,
SAP's written authorization is required for all clearing operations and it may
withhold such authorization in regard to lands prone to soil erosion or for
other environmental considerations. The authorities may stipulate that
specific conservation measures be adopted as a condition for granting a land
clearing permit.
B. Policies and Procedures Under the Lending Program
5.05      Credit to sub-borrowers would be channelled through BNA and selected
provincial banks in the project area under subsidiary loan agreements with the
Government as represented by the Ministry of Economy (para 5.10). BNA, the
principal official bank in Argentina (Chapter III), would act as head of the
group of participating banks and would be responsible for financial transac-
tions with the Bank related to reimbursements for subloans made by all the
participating banks. The participating provincial banks would be selected
by the Ministry of Economy on the basis of the following minimum credit-
worthiness requirements -- that they have been in operation for at least 10
years; have complied with Central Bank regulations on liquidity, solvency
and legal reserves against deposits; have a satisfactory financial position
and a record of sound agricultural lending; and have competent management. In
addition, a participating provincial bank should also be able to provide
counterpart funds and short-term credit to complement investment subloans
partially financed by the Bank.
5.06      Participating banks would extend subloans to finance up to 80% of
the costs of financially viable investment plans for the development of crop
and/or livestock production, weed control, or land clearing operations to be
carried out on farms and ranches located within the project area. Subloans
would be approved on the basis of farm plans prepared by sub-borrowers with
the assistance of technical staff of INTA, other participating entities, or
private consultants previously authorized by the project coordinator. The
cost of fees for technical assistance to prepare farm plans for subloan
application and advisory services during the implementation of the on-farm



- 31 -
investments, up to a maximum of 10% of the amount of the subloan, could be
included as an investment item to be financed. Evaluation of the credit-
worthiness of subloan applicants and analysis of the investment plans would
be carried out by the participating banks, who would be responsible for the
approval of subloans and would assume the risk for default. In addition to
farm plans, subloans for land clearing operations would require presentation
of a written authorization issued by the corresponding competent official
authorities and those for weed control would be authorized by INTA.
Assurances to this effect were obtained at negotiations.
5.07      PBs' subloans would have repayment terms ranging from three years to
a maximum of nine years, including grace periods of up to four years. Repay-
ment and grace period terms would be established for each subloan on the basis
of the requirements of cash flow projections. Subsidiary loans from Government
to PBs would have the same repayment terms as the Bank loan to Government and
grace periods of up to four years. PBs would be required to use any funds
accruing to them from the carrying out of the project for similar purposes and
on the same terms and conditions as those contained in the subsidiary loan
agreements.
5.08      Government would on-lend the proceeds of the Bank loan to BNA and
other PBs in local currency equivalent, assuming the foreign exchange risk.
However, the principal outstanding on loans to PBs and on the subloans made by
the PBs to project sub-borrowers would be adjusted in accordance with the
variations of the General Wholesale Price Index prepared by the National
Institute of Statistics and Census following the general guidelines
established by the CB.
5.09      Government, making use of reimbursements from Bank loan proceeds,
would on-lend to PBs 46% of the value of project subloans made by PBs to
sub-borrowers. Government lending to PBs would be made at an annual interest
rate of no less than 2.75% over the adjusted oustanding balances. PBs would
contribute from their own resources 54% of the value of the subloans to
sub-borrowers. Annual interest rates charged by PBs to sub-borrowers would be
at least 6% on the outstanding balances of subloans adjusted. Any changes in
the interest rate structure would maintain the minimum rates indicated and
ensure a minimum spread of three percentage points to PBs. This interest rate
structure has been selected to encourage investment in farming while maintain-
ing the financial viability of the participating institutions. Proportions of
financing and interest rates to be charged on adjusted balances under the
project are summarized as follows:
Sub-borrowers' minimum contribution to investment cost ......   20%
Proportion of investments to be financed by PB subloans .....    80%
Proportion of PB subloans to be financed by Government ......   46%
PB contribution for subloans ................................   54%
Minimum annual interest rate from Government to PBs .... .....  2.75%
Minimum annual interest rate from PBs to sub-borrowers ......    6%
PBs' minimum spread over Government loans ....       ...............    3%



5.10      Government, through its Ministry of Economy, would enter into
subsidiary loan agreements with PBs, incorporating terms and conditions of
the lending operations specified in the previous paragraphs, and would,
specifically, (a) incorporate terms, conditions and interest rates for on-
lending (rediscounts) between Government and the PBs and between PBs and the
sub-borrowers; (b) cover the obligation of PBs to provide counterpart funds
and short-term credit complementary to the investment credit provided by
Government; and (c) specify the procedure and basis to be used for Govern-
ment on-lending of the Bank loan proceeds and for the indexing scheme under
the lending program. Assurances on this were obtained at negotiations;
the execution of a subsidiary loan agreement between Government and BNA,
satisfactory to the Bank, would be a condition of loan effectiveness.
C. Accounting and Auditing
5.11      Separate project accounts, records and documentation pertaining to
financial transactions under the project would be kept by each participating
bank and would be made available for inspection by the Bank during the course
of supervision missions. The project accounts and related financial state-
ments would be audited annually, in accordance with generally accepted audit
standards, by independent auditors satisfactory to the Bank. Certified
copies of the audited financial statements, together with the report of the
auditors, would be sent to the Bank no later than four months after the
close of each fiscal year. Assurances on the above points were obtained
during negotiations.
D. Monitoring and Reporting
5.12      The Project Committee would be responsible for establishing and
maintaining a system of monitoring the progress of the project and evaluating
the impact of the investments and technical assistance. It is envisaged that
INTA would collect productivity and financial data on a sample of farms during
implementation of the on-farm project investments and that BNA, as head of the
group of participating banks, would assemble and analyze the information
concerning financial aspects of the project's lending program. The information
so assembled and analyzed would then be transmitted to the project coordinator,
who would be responsible for submitting to the Bank consolidated quarterly
progress reports and the annual project accounts and auditor's report (para
5.11). He would also present to the Bank a draft of a completion report
not later than six months after the proposed project investments had been
completed. Assurances were obtained at negotiations that the project
monitoring and evaluating system would be established and that a draft of
the project completion report would be prepared by the project coordinator.

VI. TECHNICAL COEFFICIENTS AND PRICES
A. On-farm Development Component
6.01      Investments under this project component would take place over an
area of more than 38 million ha in which there is a wide range of production
patterns due to differences in soils, climate, markets, supply of inputs
and communications. As a result, actual and projected technical coefficients
of livestock producing farms and yields of grain crops produced for forage
or grain will also vary greatly in relation to over 20 micro-regions in the
area. Therefore, for the purpose of project budgeting and calculation of
possible rates of return, six illustrative farm models have been prepared for
this component on the basis of the monitoring of the Balcarce Project, field
visits and information from experiment stations and demonstration farms, with
estimated technical coefficients as follows:

B. Weed Control Component
6.02      Investment under this project component would be carried out by
farmers in the selected pilot area for the control of weeds (Johnson Grass
and Bermuda Grass) which are causing large yield reductions and, in many



- 34 -
cases, preventing the growing of profitable summer crops, such as corn,
soybeans, grain, sorghum, and sunflower. A significant reduction in weed
losses is possible with intensive (by individual farmers) and extensive (many
farmers and the Government's road and railroad entities) use of existing
control techniques and credit facilities over a period of three to five years.
Total eradication is not a practicable objective.
6.03      Yield assumptions under this component are based on the following:
in a severely infested area, summer cropping is no longer viable; in a moder-
ately infested area, all crops produce lower than normal yields, but summer
crops produce substantially reduced and, in most cases, not even economically
viable yields; in clean areas, the need may be present, but only at levels
that do not interfere significantly with crop production. These areas,
however, are progressing toward moderate levels of infestation, which will
occur unless control measures are implemented. Farm models assume yields
based upon the results of trials by INTA and experience on farms where
successful weed control programs have already been implemented using currently
available herbicides, as follows:

C. Land Clearing Component
6.04      The following would be the main technological features of the land
clearing operations under the project:
(a) the land clearing technology to be carried out under the project
would consist of a complete job of clearing the superficial vegetation and
underground roots, plus additional mechanical preparation of the land being
cleared to the point of permitting immediate planting of crops. 1/ Crawler
1/   Presently, land clearing in Argentina is done with light machinery and
equipment which does not allow for a complete job. Superficial vegeta-
tion is removed but roots remain so that wheel tractors cannot be used
for plowing. It, therefore, is common to leave the roots and let pasture
grow and plow the land to plant crops only after two to four years when
the roots will have rotted away.



- 35 -
tractors, ranging from 140 to 260 hp equipped with protective cabs, bulldozers
and rear-mounted rippers would be used to clear and windrow the existing forest
into rows about 50 to 60 meters apart. The next operation would consist of
passing the ripper and a heavy disk harrow (Rome plow or Monte Cristo harrow)
to cut and pull out roots and stumps, followed by plowing and disking for
immediate planting. Depending on the time of the year, the windrows are
burned at the time they are made or allowed to dry for some months and then
burned. In either case, the soil that was gathered with the trees and brush
would thereafter be spread by cross working the fields with heavy plows and
disk harrows. Loose pieces of roots and stumps left lying on the cleared
ground must be picked up manually and burned.
(b) The forest and brush to be cleared has been divided into three
types on the basis of approximate average size of trees or brush, to establish
the number of hours of machinery work required to clear I ha of given land as
follows: (i) heavy forest cover, trees 10 to 12 m tall and 30 to 40 cm in
diameter; (ii) medium forest cover, trees 4 to 6 m tall and 20 to 25 cm in
diameter; (iii) light forest cover, trees 2 to 3 m tall and 10 to 15 cm in
diameter.
(c) The average time required to clear the various types of land
cover and to carry out the additional plowing and disking operations have
been estimated as follows:
Tractor    Bulldozer    Heavy Plow or
HP         Hours        Disk Hours      Total Hours
Heavy land cover          200           5.0           3.0              8.0
Medium land cover         200           3.5           3.0               6.5
Medium land cover       140-160         5.0           3.0              8.0
Light land cover        140-160         1.5           2.0              3.5
(d)  Farm models under this project component assume that yields of the
main crops to be produced in the cleared land will be the same as those achieved
on any other land being cultivated in the same area. Such yields, expressed
in metric tons per hectare, are: sorghum, 3 tons during the first two years
and 2 tons thereafter; sunflower, I ton; soybeans, 1.8 tons; and cotton,
1.8 tons.
D. Prices
6.05      The June 1977 farm-gate prices shown in the different models are, in
general, based on prices paid on rail at port (FOR) in the case of crops and
at the Liniers Market in the case of livestock. Because of the high rate of
inflation in Argentina, prices are expressed in US dollar equivalents, con-
verted at the rate of Argentine pesos 380 to the US dollar.



- 36 -
6.06      Prices of some commodities during the month of June 1977 were not
considered as representative; therefore, they were adjusted to arrive at more
representative figures, utilizing factors provided in the recently appraised
Grain Strage Project for Argentina and recommendations given in the FAO/CP
project preparation technical notes. Price projections were based on the
Bank's price forecasts for the major primary commodities (June 1977). A
summary of the reference commodity prices for the project's farm models is
given in the following table:
(1) Argentina - Crops - FOR/June 1977 - US$ per m ton
Wheat     Corn      Sorghum    Soybeans    Sunflower    Cotton
73.7     67.1       54.6        207.9         226.3       352.0
(2)  Argentina - Livestock - Liniers Market/June 1977 - US$/kg (liveweight)
450-kg Steers   320-kg Steers       370-kg Cows    280-kg Heifers
0.35          0.34                0.21             0.31
The trend of the Bank's price forecast, which in most cases is upward until
1980, is analyzed in Chapter VII.
VII. PROJECT PRODUCTION, DEMAND AND MARKETING
A. Production
7.01      At full development, annual incremental production of the project's
main commodities would be approximately as follows:
Incremental    Incremental Production
Production at      as % of 1976 National
Commodity                 Production   Full Development           Production

Corn               "          8,300           135                    1.6
Sorghum            "         6,600             25                    2.0

Soybeans           "          1,400           143                   10.2
Cotton             "            140            11                    7.9
Cattle sales ('000 head)   13,727             193                    1.4
Sheep sales ('000 head)       8,137            56                    0.7
At full development, using 1977 projected prices, the annual total value of
incremental output would be about US$72 million, while the incremental herd
value would amount to US$30 million, giving a total value of US$102 million.



-37-
Rough estimates indicate that about 80% of the total value can be attributed
to increased production and 20% to higher prices. For crops, about 93%
of the value is from increased production and for livestock, about 65%.
B. Demand and Marketing
7.02      In view of Argentina's comparative advantage in feed grains, oilseeds
and beef, the incremental production of the main products would lead directly
or indirectly to an increase of exports, the Bank-financed grain storage
project will substantially expand the storage capacity. The Government's
policy of returning to the private sector the industries that it acquired over
the years and its policy of non-interference in marketing will improve live-
stock marketing. Marketing arrangements for beef and sheep are adequate, and
slaughter facilities and capacity are ample to handle the incremental beef
output expected from the project.
7.03      Over the period 1960-76, the growth of beef production was about 1%
per year while consumption increased at about 1.5% per year - approximately
equivalent to the growth in population. Exports decreased at about 1.2% per
year. Incremental production under the project is estimated at about 38,000
tons of carcass beef per annum at full development, equivalent to a growth
of national production of about 0.2% per year.
7.04      Bank projections are that the world beef trade should grow at more
than 6% per year up to 1985. However, Argentina does face some problems in
relation to the three major beef import markets, namely the, USA, Japan and
the EEC. The USA and Japan do not accept uncooked beef from countries
affected by foot-and-mouth disease and this will keep Argentina out of these
markets for some years to come. The EEC was Argentina's major market for
beef until 1973 but it imposed a virtual ban on imports from third countries
from July 1974 to May 1975. While this ban has been gradually relaxed since
then, the EEC remains an uncertain market for large exportable surpluses
of beef. In order to obtain some stability in export demand, Argentina beef
exporters have been actively seeking outlets in other areas where there is a
growing demand for beef, e.g., other Latin American countries, Eastern Europe,
non-EEC countries in Western Europe, the Middle East and some countries in
Africa.  In the meantime, the return of the major meat processing facilities
to the private sector should help promote the adjustments which are needed to
develop new market outlets.
7.05      The grain and oilseed outlook for the next few years is mixed.
A rapid increase of wheat and coarse grain exports to developing countries
is expected over the next few years until 1985. The World Bank's price
projections indicate the following changes up to 1980: wheat, +17% a year;
corn, +11% a year; and sorghum +9% a year. For oilseeds, the Bank's price
projections suggest weakening demand in the next few years, with fairly strong
price increases between 1980 and 1985. Soybean prices in 1980 are projected
to be 11% lower than in 1977 and then to increase about 4.5% a year until 1985.
Cotton prices are projected to drop about 10% by 1980 and then remain in that
range.

- 39 -
8.02      The financial rates of return indicate that it would be profitable
to farmers to undertake the investments envisaged in the illustrative models.
The estimated magnitude of the rate of return for the different types of
investments contemplated in the project is in line with the actual demand for
funds for investments for beef and grain crop production in the Pampean region,
for weed control in the infested areas, and for expansion of the agricultural
frontier through land clearing operations. Rate of return calculations have
been made on the basis of incremental returns, after allowing farms without
project investment the benefit of the improved prices forecast by the Bank for
the commodities that they are now producing.
B. Project Cash Flow
8.03      The estimated project cash flow of the lending program to be handled
by BNA and other participating banks is given in the table on page 40. The
cash inflow would be derived from Government lending of the proceeds of the
Bank loan, counterpart funds contributed from the participating banks' own
resources, and the repayment of principal and interest (at 6% per annum).
The cash outflow consists of subloans to project beneficiaries, repayment of
principal and interest (at 3% per annum) to Government, the cost of their own
funds (estimated at 3%) and the administrative costs related to the lending
program, estimated by the banks at 2.5% over the outstanding portfolio. The
calculations indicate that the 3% gross margin allowed to participating banks
over the indexed capital loaned to beneficiaries would be sufficient to cover
administrative costs, and that, during the 13-year period of project opera-
tions, they could accumulate net earnings amounting to US$2 million.
C. Project Cost Recovery
8.04      Project beneficiaries would contribute at least 20% of their
investment plans. The participating banks' lending, amounting to 80% of the
investments, as in the case of all other loans made with their own resources,
is expected to be fully recovered. The technical assistance cost, amounting
to about 2% of the agricultural investment cost, is included as part of the
beneficiary's total investment cost and will therefore also be recovered
through the repayment of subloans.

IX.  ECONOMIC ANALYSIS
A. Economic Benefits
9.01      The proposed project would help Argentina in making significant
progress toward-, achieving the full potential of some of its most fertile
agricultural regions. The investments under the project would yield an
impressive overall economic rate of return of 29% (para 9.05), reflecting
economic benefits to the country of over US$72 million annually at full
development, from incremental production of about US$11 million of grains,
US$28 million of oilseeds and cotton, and US$33 million of livestock products.
Incremental herd value would amount to another US$30 million. The project
would help the agricultural sector continue as the main source of foreign
exchange earnings, and increase productivity through the use of the latest
technology, thus promoting the country's role as a low-cost provider of the
food needed by developing countries. It would also contribute to better
land utilization through the shifting of some livestock and crop production
to newer developed areas. In addition, widespread impact could also be
expected in terms of demonstrating to the farmers the benefits of intensified
land use, increased application of fertilizer, and adoption of other improved
practices.
9.02      The project's contribution to employment would come from job oppor-
tunities generated at the farm level since the land clearing component would
require an increase in the number of crawler tractor drivers, mechanics
and hand labor. This component would also contribute to the regional devel-
opment of Argentina's northern provinces.
9.03      A major benefit to the country would come in the form of incremental
returns to the Government from taxes and duties on land, sales and income,
which would reach an estimated US$14.6 million per year at full development,
on the assumption that the tax base on which producers would pay income tax is
about one-half of their net income because of allowances, deductions, and the
like, 1/ except in the case of farmers/contractors (Farm Model 11) for whom
the proportion would be 80%. In addition, the Government would also receive
approximately US$20 million from taxes directly related to the project invest-
ments, and about $3.5 million per year, at full development, by way of export
at the presently reduced rate of about 5%. The following table indicates the
amount of tax that each farm model would generate:
1/   As of September 1977, the basic tax rate was 7% on net profits of US$500
equivalent, with the rate on successive tranches rising progressively to
a maximum of 45% on the amounts in excess of US$47,000 equivalent.

/1   Tax base is assumed at 50% of net income for Far Models 1 to 10 and at 80%
for Farm Model 11 (para 9.03).
B. Economic Rate of Return
9.04      The rates of return from the project to the economy have been
calculated separately for each farm model as shown in the table on page 44,
on the following basis:
(a) prices used to estimate benefits for all products
correspond to world market prices as projected by the
Commodities and Export Projections Division of the Bank's
Economic Analysis and Projections Department. All
prices have been expressed in constant 1977 US dollars;
(b) project costs for economic evaluation are based on
June 1977 prices. No allowances were made for
changes in real cost. The exchange rate used is
$a 380/US$1;
(c) labor has been evaluated at the recorded wage rate because
it is felt that no serious market distortions exist;
(d) deductions were made for prevailing taxes and duties;
(e) salvage values and incremental herd values were included
as benefits when appropriate at the end of the 15-year
period used for the rate of return calculation; and
(f) the analysis of the land clearing component assumes land
use based only on prevailing technology, though the poten-
tial for higher and better yields exists and can be
realized in due course.



- 43 -
9.05      The weighted average economic rate of return (ERR) for the proposed
project is estimated at 29% based on the summation of the costs and related
quantified benefits. Should yields be lower than expected or prices of output
drop to cause a 15% decline in benefits, the ERR would be about 23%. Should
costs of the project increase by 15% without increasing benefits, the ERR
would be about 26%. Of the individual components of the project, the weed
control component has the highest ERR at 43%, followed by the on-farm invest-
ment component with 30%. The estimated ERR of 20% on the land clearing
component is based on the assumption of using existing farm techniques in the
region on the cleared land but potential exists for achieving higher yields
through the use of advanced, locally tested technology.
C. ProJect Risk
9.06      The project faces no major risks.  The demand for project invest-
ment loans will depend on the ability of the Government to curb the inflationary
trend, and on improved world prices for agricultural commodities as forecast by
the Bank. The Argentine Government is committed to pursue policies designed
to check inflation and to improve the terms of trade in favor of agriculture
to provide incentives for continuous production increases.
D. Impact on Environment
9.07      No long-term adverse environmental effects are expected as a conse-
quence of the execution of the project. SEAG has an effective system of
licensing and controlling the use of chemicals and fertilizers and the nine
provinces where land clearing would take place have satisfactory land clearing
laws to protect the environment. Moreover, written authorization by the'appro-
priate provincial government office would be required before a subloan for
land clearing operations could be approved (para 5.06).

X. SUMMARY OF AGREEMENTS REACHED AND RECOMMENDATION
10.01     During negotiations, assurances were obtained from the Government
that:
(a)  the project coordinator would be a qualified professional
with experience in agricultural development activities,
selected and appointed by the Project Committee
(para 5.02);
(b)  farm investment plans for land clearing operations
would be accompanied by a land clearing permit issued
by the competent authority and those for weed control
would be authorized by INTA (para 5.06);
(c)  the Government would enter into subsidiary loan agreements,
satisfactory to the Bank, with each participating bank
(para 5.10);
(d)  separate project accounts would be kept by each parti-
cipating bank and would be made available for inspection
by the Bank; that the project accounts would be audited
by independent auditors acceptable to the Bank; and
that certified copies of the audited financial statements,
together with the report from the auditors, would be
sent to the Bank no later than four months after the
close of each fiscal year (para 5.11); and
(e)  a project monitoring and evaluation system would be estab-
lished and that a draft of the project completion report
would be prepared by the project coordinator (para 5.12).
10.02     Conditions of effectiveness of the loan would be that:
(a)  the Project Committee had been established (para 5.01);
(b)  the project coordinator had been appointed (para 5.02);
and
(c)  the Government had signed a subsidiary loan agreement,
satisfactory to the Bank, with BNA (para 5.10).
