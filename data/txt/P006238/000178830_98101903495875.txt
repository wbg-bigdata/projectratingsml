APPRAISAL OF THE VOLTA GRANDE HYDROELECTRIC PROJECT
CENTRAIS ELETRICAS DE MINAS GERAIS, S.A.
SUMMARY
i.        This report covers the appraisal of a project of Centrais
Eletricas de Minas Gerais, S.A. (Cemig) consisting of the construction of
the 400 Mw Volta Grande hydroelectric plant and associated transmission
in the south-central region of Brazil. The project is estimated to cost a
total of US$78.5 million equivalent and the proposed Bank loan would amount
to US$26.6 million equivalent. The project represents a part of the
overall expansion program of Cemig, the total of which is estimated at
US$280 million during the project construction period 1969-1974 inclusive.
ii.       The Borrower would be Cemig, an autonomous electric utility
company principally owned by the State of Minas Gerais. Two previous
loans No. 76-BR for US$7.3 million in 1953 for the construction of the
Itutinga hydroelectric station and No. 442-BR for US$h9 million in 1966
for the Jaguara hydroelectric project, have been made to Cemig. Exper-
ience with the two loans has been satisfactory.
iii.      The project is technically sound, the estimated cost is reason-
able and the arrangements for engineering, procurement and construction
are satisfactory. The facilities to be provided are necessary to enable
Cemig to meet the expected demands for power. The financing arrangements
are satisfactory.
iv.       Cemig would be a suitable borrower. Since its formation in
1952 it has operated its organization and properties efficiently and has
made good progress in developing its staff and methods.
v.        The project would be suitable for a Bank loan of US$26.6 million
equivalent for 25 years including a grace period of six and one half years.



ERAZIL
APPRAISAL OF THE VOLTA GRANDE HYDROELECTRIC PROJECT
CENTRAIS ELETRICAS DE MINAS GERAIS, S.A.
I. INTRODUCTION
1.01      Centrais Eletricas de Minas Gerais, S.A. (Cemig) a corporation
owned principally by the Government of the State of Minas Gerais, has
asked the Bank for a loan of US$26.6 million equivalent to cover the
foreign exchange cost of a project with a total cost of US$78.5 million.
The project would form part of the Cemig development program over the
period 1969-1974 inclusive which is estimated to cost a total of US$280
million equivalent.
1.02      The project consists of the construction of the 400 Mw Volta
Grande hydroelectric project and associated 345 kv transmission. It would
be the third loan to Cemig. The first, No. 76 BR in 1953 for US$7.3 mil-
lion, was for the Itutinga hydroelectric project. The second, No. 442 BR
in March 1966, for US$49 million financed the construction of the Jaguara
hydroelectric project and associated 345 kv transmission, the construction
of which are proceeding satisfactorily.
1.03      The proposed project and those previously financed, were studied
by Canambra, a consortium of three consulting firms, under a United Nations
Special Fund grant for which the Bank acted as Executing Agency, which had
as its objective the determination of a long range expansion program for
development of the electricity facilities in the south-central region of
Brazil.
1.04      The proposed loan to Cemig is one of two companion loans for
electric utility development, the second of which is proposed for Central
Eletrica de Furnas S.A. (Furnas) to finance the 360 14w Porto Colombia
hydroelectric project and transmission. Both projects are located on the
Rio Grande River and their output would be delivered to the interconnected
345 kv transmission system to supply the south-central region. Because
of the closely linked nature of the two projects they are considered
jointly in this report where appropriate.
1.05      This report is based on the findings of Bank missions in February
1968 by Mr. D. King and April/May 1968 by Messrs. D. King, M. J. Reis and
F. Rydell.
1.06      Subsequent to the preparation of this report, the official
exchange rate was changed on August 27, 1968 to NCr$3.65 to US$1 from
NCr$3.22 to US$1. Since this does not substantially affect the overall
financial situation and plan of Cemig in view of the provisions of
Brazilian law regarding tariffs as described herein (Annex 9), the
financial statements have not been recast. Delay in the preparation
of this report has thereby been avoided.

2. THE BORROWER
2.01      The Borrowier would be Cemig, an autonomous corporation owned
principally by the State of Minas Gerais, which was established in 1952.
It is responsible for formulating and administering the public power
expansion program of that state and is the principal supplier of electric
power in it.
2.02      As of April 30, 1968 total share capital of Cemig was NCr$240
million divided as follows:
Shareholder                                     Ordinary   Preference
State of Minas Gerais                              81.4       35.0
Centrais Eletricas Brasileiras S.A. - Eletrobras  13.5        21.7
Public                                              5.1       43.3
100.0       100.0
Total Number of Shares                 148,000,000  92,000,000
2.03      Cemig is administered by a Board of Directors of seven which deter-
mines general policy. In addition, there is a management group consisting
of the President and six officers responsible for the operation of the
utility, which has the following departments: Distribution 1,300 personnel,
Production and Transmission 800, Technical 340, Legal and Industrial
Relations 200, Administration 480, Finance 230, and Purchasing 190; a total
of approximately 3,600 employees.
2.04      Cemig is well organized and managed.- Because of the high caliber
of its management a number of its senior officials have been seconded to
important posts in the Federal Government. For several years a Cemig
official acted in the capacity of Minister of Mines and Energy and at present
the President of Cemig is on leave of absence and acting as President of
Eletrobras, the Federal Government company responsible for the electric
power sector. The Vice President of Cemig is acting-President of that
organization.
2.05      Cemig maintains an efficient training organization and operates a
well organized training school for operators and maintenance staff. Provi-
sion is contained in the proposed loan for additional ,training in technical,
financial and administrative activities. Cemig has a capable engineering
staff but for the design and construction of major projects employs consult-
ing engineers and hires contractors. While the expansion of Cemig's gene-
ration, transmission, and distribution system has been rapid, the
development of its management and staff through training and experience,
supplemented by the assistance of consultants and contractors, has enabled
it to operate its system and administer its construction program efficiently.
The Cemig organization and the number of employees it has are satisfactory
given the scope of its operations.



-3-
The Facilities of the Borrower
2.06      Cemig's area of operations is the State of Minas Gerais, where it
provides service to an area of 220,000 sq. km. predominantly in the southern
part of the state. The northern half of the state is comparatively barren
and unsettled whereas the southern half is very rich in minerals and is one
of the most important industrial areas in Brazil. Cemig sales in 1967
amounted to about 2.7 billion kwh. Since its organization in 1952 Cemig has
expanded its service to supply 342 towns and districts and 251,000 consumers.
2.07      Annex 1 lists Cemig's existing generating stations and those
under construction or planned, Present generating capacity is 527 Mw and
on completion of the stations under construction, and the proposed pro-
ject in 1974, the total generating capacity would amount to 1,457 Mw. In
addition Cemig has a right to one-half the output of 900 Mw Furnas hydro-
electric plant commissioned in 1963. Cemig began to exercise its option
to purchase large blocks of the output of this plant in 1968 and will by
1975 have contracted for its full 450 Mw share.
2.08      Given its wide area of operations, Cemig has a very extensive
transmission system, operating at voltage levels of 345 kv, 230 kv, 161
kv and 138 kv and aggregating a circuit length of 2,500 km. There are
3,400 km of sub-transmission circuit, ranging from 69 to 16.5 kv and
4,800 km of 13.2 kv primary distribution. Installed capacity of step-
down substations amounts to 1,160 Mva.
2.09      While Cemig is the most important electric utility in the state
there are a number of communities with their own generating facilities
and/or distribution system, as well as mines and industries with their own
power supply facilities. The most important is Companhia Forca e Luz de
Minas Gerais (CFLMG) which supplies Belo Horizonte, the capital of the
State.  CFL1G is owned by Eletrobras, and purchases the bulk of its energy
requirements from Cemig. Electric utilities other than Cemig, and in-
dustries and mining concerns supplied from their own generating facilities
about 1.7 billion kwh in 1967 representing about 37% of total consumption
in the state.
3. SECTOR DEVELOPNENT
3.01      The State of Minas Gerais is one of the most important market
areas and Cemig one of the most important electric utilities in the south-
central region of Brazil, which represents two-thirds of the total power
market of the country including the states of Guanabara, Sao Paulo, Rio
de Janeiro and Espirito Santo. The main utilities which supply and dis-
tribute power in this region in addition to Cemig are Centrais Eletricas
de Sao Paulo (CESP), Furnas and the Brazilian Power Company subsidiary
Light S.A. - Servicos de Eletricidade.



3.02      Coordination of the operation and development of electric power
facilities in the south-central region, has evolved to the point where
the responsibilities of individual companies are fairly well defined.
This coordination has been achieved gradually during the past four years,
the urging of international lending agencies having been an important
factor in this connection. In the State of Sao Paulo which provides the
major market, CESP, the state owned utility, now supplies a portion of the
market but has underway a very large construction program which will enable
it eventually to supply virtually all of the State's future increase in
demand. The city of Rio de Janeiro in the State of Guanabara is supplied
by Light S.A. Furnas, which is largely owned by the Federal Government, has
the responsibility of providing generation requirements of the south-central
region to the extent they are not provided by the three main utilities.
Furnas has negotiated contracts with the utilities to which it supplies bulk
power including Cemig, and CESP has made a contract arrangement with its
most important consumer, Light S.A., for the supply in future of the city
of Sao Paulo,.
3.03      The Canambra study established a long term plan of development
and provided a priority list of power development sites based on the unit
cost of each development. The main entities concerned, Furnas, CESP and
Cemig - representing the Federal Government and two of the most important
states - have generally followed this priority list in planning their re-
spective expansion programs and the lending agencies which have assisted
the development program in the south-central region have used the priority
list in orienting their assistance.
3.04      Development of the high voltage transmission system was planned
along broad lines in the Canambra report and Cemig and Furnas have made a
review in connection with the proposed loans. The major companies in the
south-central region have organized a system inter-connection committee,
the purpose of which is to establish procedures leading to the most efficient
operation of the combined systems, collaboration in the release of equipment
for maintenance, particularly generating facilities, arrangements for mutual
assistance in the event of emergencies, load and frequency control and
coordination of system protection.
3.05      As the south-central power facilities have grown coordination of
the planning and operations of the main utilities therein has grown commen-
surately. This has been essential. While much has been done it will be
of prime importance to continue the effort and translate it into operat-
ing efficiency as new facilities come in operation.
3.06      Most important has been the development of the distribution
systenDswhich ultimately use the power from the new generation facilities.
The Bank and other lending agencies are playing an important role in this
connection. The Bank financed the rehabilitation and expansion of four of
the major distribution systems in the south-central and adjoining regions
under Loans 475-478-BR, December 1966, totalling US$61.6 million. The
work covered systems in the cities of Belo Horizonte and Niteroi and Cia
Paulista De Forca E Luz, S.A, (CPFL), in the south-central region.



-5-
This work should be completed about 1970. AID financed the rehabilitation
and expansion of the distribution systems in the cities of Rio de Janeiro
and Sao Paulo in an aggregate amount exceeding US$40 million. This program
is to be completed in 1969 and Light S.A. is seeking financial assistance
for further expansion of its distribution facilities.
3.07      Cemig is undertaking a major expansion of the distribution system
in the State of MinaLj Gerais. The State of Sao Paulo and CESP are respon-
sible for distribution in the areas in that state which are not under con-
cession to Light S.A. and CPFL. In general, therefore, there is reasonably
adequate provision for the expansion of distribution facilities, but it
will be essential to maintain progress in the 1970's so as to keep pace
with load growth and fully utilize the new generating facilities being
provided. During the project construction period Cemig will continue its
expansion of 220 kv, 138 kv and 69 kv transmission facilities, and of
secondary distribution systems to provide service to a total number of
about 700 communities.
3.08      In addition to the projects under construction as set out in
Annex 1, Cemig considers that it may be necessary to build the 240 Mw
Igarapava hydroelectric plant for operation in the late 1970's. This
would be largely contingent on developments within the power sector in
the south-central region. Assurances have been received that during
the construction period, l969-l974, Cemig would not undertake any major
projects other than Volta Grande and those projects already under con-
struction (Annex 1), without the approval of the Bank. A similar condition
is contained in Loan 442-BR.
4. THE PROJECT
4.0l      The project proposed for Bank financing represents about 28% of
the expansion program of Cemig which envisages the construction of about
930 Mw of new generating facilities during 1969-74, Annex 1. It would
consist of the construction of the Volta Grande hydroelectric station with
a capacity of 400 M4w and the construction of 345 kv transmission line be-
tween Volta Grande and Belo Horizonte, the load center of Cemig's system,
and associated 345 kv substation facilities.
Volta Grande Hydroelectric Station
4.02      The Volta Grande hydroelectric station would be located on the
Rio Grande River 45 km upstream from its junction with the Pardo River
and approximately 500 km from Sao Paulo, as shown on the map. It would be
downstream from the Jaguara hydroelectric station. A drainage area of
68,800 sq. km, of which the run-off from 52,000 sq. Ian are regulated by
the Furnas station storage reservoir, would supply water to Volta Grande.
The hydrology of the Rio Grande River was studied in detail by Canambra
and the geology of the Volta Grande site investigated in the Canambra
feasibility studies of potential hydroelectric sites.



4.03      Volta Grande would be equipped with 4-100 Mw units. The plant
factor would be 45% providing an annual firm energy capacity of 1.58 bil-
lion kwh based on driest season conditions as experienced in the serious
drought period of 195311956. The station would operate at a head of 27.3
meters utilizing Kaplan type turbines suitable for comparatively low head
operation.
4.04      The main feature of the civil works would be the earth-filled
dam 30 meters high with a crest length of 1,200 meters and a volume of
3,800,000 cubic meters. Total concrete content of the project would be
about 220,000 cubic meters, of which the power station would account for
about one-half. The powerhouse would be of the semi-outdoor type. No
major construction problems are anticipated.
Transmission
4.05      The output of the proposed Volta Grande power station would be
delivered to Belo Horizonte and the interconnected system over a new 345
kv transmission line, 475 km long, equipped with twin conductors similar
to existing 345 kv circuits. Power would be transformed at Volta Grande
from the 13.8 kv generator voltage to 345 kv by two sets of 225 Mva trans-
formers. The transmission line would be interconnected with the 345 kv
system at the Jaguara hydroelectric power station, a new substation at
Pimenta, and would terminate near Belo Horizonte at a new 345/230 kv
substation with a capacity of 450 Mw.

The total cost of the project would be US$95.3 million equivalent including
interest during construction of US$16.8 million equivalent. The proposed
loan of US$26.6 million equivalent is the estimated cost of the equipment
to be purchased after international competitive bidding, including contracts
won by Brazilian suppliers, (Para. 5.01, 5.02).  Interest during construction
would not be financed by the proposed loan. The loan would represent 287k
1/ Gates and similar equipment which would not be included in the civil
works contract and which would be bid upon separately.



-8-
of the total estimated cost of the project including interest during con-
struction and 9.5 % of the total construction expenditures planned by Cemig
during the 1969-1974 construction period. No reimbursement would be made
for expenditures incurred prior to the signing of the proposed loan.
4.07      The unit cost of Volta Grande would be US$153 per kw, excluding
transmission and interest during construction, which places it in the
category of very low cost hydro. The cost estimate is based on the
feasibility study made by Canambra updated by Cemig engineering staff.
Contingency allowances of 15% for the civil works and other local financing
costs and 10% for equipment and other Bank financed costs have been included.
4.08      Experience with recent power loans in Brazil has been that the
Bank financed portions of the projects were somewhat overestimated, in part
due to provision in the estimates for the additional cost of orders which
might be awarded Brazilian manufacturers under the 15% preference formula
(Par. 5eOl, 5.02). As it is likely, on the basis of experience, that
substantially less than half of the equipment orders would be awarded to
Brazilian suppliers, the equipment costs estimated contain in effect built-
in contingency amounts. In view of this, and since the proposed loan would
not finance civil construction, which is usually the most important source
of cost overrun on hydroelectric projects, the loan does not include in it an
amount for contingencies. In the cost estimate, paragraph 4.06, and Annex 2,
contingency amounts are therefore shown as local financing items.
Engineerina and Construction
4.09      The feasibility study made by Canambra provided the necessary
information for planning and financing purposes. Cemig is now selecting
consultants for the detailed design of the hydroelectric station. The
civil works would be undertaken by a Brazilian contractor of adequate ex-
perience chosen on the basis of competitive bidding. As in the case of the
Jaguara project, Cemig would probably undertake some of the electrical/
mechanical work. These arrangements are satisfactory. The provisions
contained in Loan 442-BR requiring the employment of consultants and con-
tractors satisfactory to the Bank are repeated in the proposed agreement.
4.10      Engineering and design of the project would commence about the
end of 1968. Tenders for major equipment would be called and the main con-
struction contracts awarded during 1969. Construction would start at the
beginning of 1970 with completion of the first generator scheduled for mid-
1973 and of the whole plant for the summer of 1974. The construction per-
iod is reasonable for a project of this size.
5. PROCUREMENT AND DISBURSEIENT
5.01      Procurement of the goods and equipment financed under the loan
would be on the basis of international competitive bidding except in the
case of certain minor items for which such bidding would be impractical.
As in the previous case of power loans in Brazil, Brazilian suppliers
would be eligible to compete in the bidding with the advantage of a 15%
preference.



-9-
5.02      The method of comparing foreign and domestic bids for goods to
be procured from the loan would be as agreed between the Government and
Bank in connection with the previous power loans and is quoted in part
as follows:
"The Borroweer intends to invite firms producing goods
in Brazil to participate in the international competi-
tive bidding. In the case of goods produced in Brazil
the Borrcwer may award the order to the lowest Brazilian
bidder offering satisfactory terms and conditions pro-
vided that his offered price does not exceed the offered
price of the lowest acceptable foreign bidder by more than
15%. Comparison of bids will be made without taking into
account customs or other similar duties. For firms in
Brazil the delivery price will comprise the f.o.b. plant
cost plus freight, insurance and other delivery costs to
the site. For non-Brazilian firms the delivery price will
be based on the c.i.f. landed costs, port of entry, before
customs duties plus inland freight, insurance and other
delivery costs to the site. As the fifteen per cent prefer-
ence allowed firms in Brazil is in lieu of customs duties
the 15% will be added to the c.i.f. landed cost (excluding
custams duties) of non-Brazilian goods before inland freight,
insurance and other costs. In the case of bids composed of
both cruzeiros and foreign currency the cruzeiro portion thereof
will be dealt with as a Brazilian bid and the foreign exchange
portion as a non-Brazilian bid.
For comparison purposes all bids after evaluation will be
converted into cruzeiros at the bid comparison rate of
exchange. The bid comparison rate of exchange is understood
to be the dollar selling rate of the Banco Central da Republica
do Brazil plus the exchange surtax 1/ (but not to exceed 30%)
if any prevailing on the date 30 days prior to the date on
which bids are closed. It is further understood that the Bank
will on its own initiative or at the request of the Borrower
or Guarantor reconsider and if necessary revise the bid comparison
rate of exchange whenever there should be a substantial change
in the Brazilian exchange system which would in the judgment
of the Bank render such rates unsuitable for bid comparison
purposes.
The Guarantor will take all such measures as shall be necessary
in order to facilitate the importation of goods purchased
outside Brazil in accordance with the provisions hereof and of
the loan agreement."
1/ The exchange surtax was discontinued in 1965.

6. JUSTIFICATION OF THE PROJECT
Load Growth-Cemig
6.01      Annex 3 gives the actual and forecast energy sales for the period
1965-75. In the five-year period ending in 1963 sales grew rapidly, increas-
ing at an average rate of about 20% per annum. During the following four
years the annual average rate of increase was about 12% although 1966 and
1967 averaged about 15%.
6.02      An average increase of 14.5% annually is forecast for the eight-
year period, 1968-75. The forecast during the first five years of this
period is based largely on information concerning the development of indi-
vidual industrial companies and results in an estimated annual rate of
increase of 16%. For the remaining three years of the forecast the increase
of demand is expected to decline to about 12% per annum.
Industrial Sales
6.03      The southern section of the State of Minas Gerais is one of the
most important industrial areas in Brazil and as is shown in Annex 3 in-
dustrial sales account for almost 70% of Cemig's market. Industry is based
predominantly on the minerals found in the area, including iron ore, (some
of the richest deposits in the world are found in the area), nickel, bauxite,
various other industrial metals, gold and semi-precious gems.
6.o4      The mining and metallurgical industries account for some 40 power
supply contracts for large amounts of power. There are approximately 50
other industrial customers including 9 textile, 6 petrochemical, three paper,
10 food processing also consvruction, electrical equipment manufacturers
and other small companies. Cemig has based its forecast of the increase of
industrial demand for the 1968-72 period on actual contract commitments by
the companies, and their projection of individual increases of demand. The
largest increases occur in the metallurgical sector and are covered by con-
tracts which have been completed or are under negotiation.
Sales to Other Utilities
6.05      Cemig sells approximately 14% of its production to other utilities
in the State for resale and while sales are made to a total of 13 distribution
companies the bulk is to Companhia Forca e Luz de Minas Gerais (CFLMG) which
supplies the city of Belo Horizonte. The estimated increase of sales to
CFLMG averages about 11% annually over the 1968-75 period. However, CFLMG
supplies about 20% of its present demand from its own generating capacity
and taking this into account the increase in Cemigts sales to CFLMG would
provide for an eight per cent annual rate of growth of the latter, which is
reasonable.
Distribution Sales
6.06      Sales to its distribution customers accounts for about 16% of
Cemig's total sales. An average increase in the period of about 14-1/2%
annually is estimated. This follows the present trend and is based not only



on supplying the growth of present customers but also on continued expansion
to serve areas presently without service. In this respect Cemig has under-
way an extensive program of a distribution expansion which it plans to main-
tain in the future (Paragraph 3.07).
6.07      While the projected 14.5% annual rate of Cemig growth is high
it is justified on the basis of past trends, definite industrial prospects
and expansion of the distribution systems servicing domestic users in the
State. As noted in paragraph 2.09, there are additional electric utility
sales of about 1.7 billion kwh in the State. The magnitude of such in-
dependent sales, which supplement Cemig's supply, is unlikely to change
very much and when added to Cemig's the total sales in the state were about
4.4 billion kwh in 1967 and are forecast to increase to 9.7 billion kwh
in 1975, an estimated average increase of about 10.5% per annum.
System Capacity
6.08      Annex 1 sets forth a tabulation of existing and planned capacity
and Annexes 4 and 5 show in chart form the relationship between system
capacity and demand for both the peak and energy requirements. The latter
indicate that with the planned expansion program the capacity of the Cemig
system with respect to both peak capacity and energy would keep pace with
the demand. In the case of energy production the effect of very dry
years is taken into consideration and the output of the hydroelectric
plants and their energy capability is based on the experience in dry years,
particularly 1953-56, and for peak capacity, allowance has been made for
equipment maintenance and spinning reserve.
6.09      As noted in paragraph 1.04 Cemig and Furnas transmit power over
345 kv systems which are fully integrated, and supply about 3/5 of the
south-central market. A shortage of capacity experienced by either of
these two systems would in practice be compensated for by spare capacity,
if available, on the other system. A shortage of capacity in the balance
of the south-central system, particularly the area served by CESP in the
State of Sao Paulo, would be made up by any spare capacity available from
the combined Furnas-Cemig systems. Annexes 6 and 7 show the total firm
capacity and demand of the combined Furnas-Cemig systems.
6.10      These charts show that the capacity and estimated demand of the
combined systems are in approximate balance for most of the period to 1975.
In 1974 on completion of the proposed project and the project proposed by
Furnas, which together would provide 760 Mw, the combined demand would be
approximately 4,000 Mw. The firm capacity reserve would be about 150 Mw
representing about four per cnt of the demand on the combined systems, and
the firm energy reserve would be about 1 billion kwh or five per cent of the
total energy requirement.
6.11      This firm reserve is modest for a system of this magnitude.  It
would barely provide for delay in commissioning to full capacity of the
Cemig and/or Furnas projects, and in assisting the supply of the remainder
of the south-central region in the event of delay to the scheduled start
of operations in 1973/74 of the very large Ilha Solteira station of 1,700
Mw capacity which is under construction by CESP. The construction of hydro-
electric projects has often been delayed in Brazil by physical, organiza-



-12-
tional, and financial difficulties, and there is a possibility of delay to
Ilha Solteira, given its very large magnitude. The Federal Government, in
view of its predominant position in the power sector and its responsibility
for the national economy, and Furnas consider that it may be adirtsable to
bring into operation additional generating facilities by 1974 to safeguard
against serious delay to nIha Solteira, but will wait developments with re-
gard to the progress of construction during the next year before reaching a
decision.
6.12      From the standpoint of the combined Furnas-Cemig system, the possi-
bility of not attaining the demand indicated in Annexes 6 and 7 for 1974 is
more than offset by the possibility of delay in commissioning of Porto
Colombia, Volta Grande and particularly nfha Solteira.  If the projects are
not brought in service as presently planned, there would be a reduction in
the amount of load which could be carried on the interconnected south-central
system.
Canambra Forecast
6.13      The Canambra study concluded that load growth in the south-central
region would develop at an annual rate of between nine per cent and 11% and
accordingly it provided a high forecast at an 1l% rate, a median forecast
at tet per cent and a low forecast at nine per cent for planning purposes.
On the basis of the region demand in 1967 and the lowest Canambra projection,
nine per cent, the expansion program underway, including the proposed Bank
projects, w,ould just suffice to meet the 1974 demand when the proposed pro-
jects are completed.
6.14      The possibility of this rate of growth being achieved is supported
by the Bankts 1968 Brazil Economic Nlission which considered that the Gross
Domestic Product (GDP) of Brazil could likely increase at an annual rate of
approximately 5.5% between 1968 and 1970 and six per cent in the following
decade. Past experience in Brazil shows that the annual increase in power
demand in the south-central region is between 1$. and 2 times that of the
annual increase in GDP and on this basis the annual increase in power demand
should be at least nine per cent.
6.15      In view of the foregoing, the Cemig expansion program and the
Volta Grande project are justified on the basis of Cemig's load forecast,
the forecast of demand for the region, and in the context of economic growth
estimates. Additionally the rate of return on the proposed project is ade-
quate as noted in the following paragraph.
Internal Rate of Return
6.16      Under Brazil tariff regulations utilities are authorized to earn
a 10% return on assets and are assured continuance of this return when a
new asset is placed in service. This has the effect of producing an incre-
mental rate of return in the order of ten per cent on new facilities.
Accurate analytical determination of the incremental return is limited by
the fact that given the high rate of inflation experienced in Brazil the
book value of assets does not necessarily reflect real cost which raises some
question as to the tariff to be used in the calculation. Subject to this



-13-
limitation, the calculation, as described in Annex 8, includes an incre-
mental rate of return of 10.2% on the project. This is considered satis-
factory since the economic rate of return is expected to be substantially
higher than internal rate of return and thus would exceed the opportunity
cost of capital in Brazil which for the Canambra report was estimated to
be between eight and ten per cent. Moreover in addition to the power rates
charged by utilities certain taxes are levied on consumers for investment
in the electric sector. (Annex 9)
6.17      In a broader sense, given the relationship between GDP and growth
of the power sector (paragraph 6.14), failure to develop the sector to keep
pace with expected GDP would result in some deterioration of the economy.
This was evident during 1961-64 when political developments and the failure
of the Government to allow adequate tariffs to be levied resulted in a
virtual cessation of expansion of electric utility facilities leading to
the inability of utilities to make an adequate supply of power available
to new industry in the south-central region. Partly as a consequence of
this, new industrial development was stagnant in the period.
Alternative Sources of Capacity
6.18      The proposed projects represent the most economic form in which
additional generating capacity can be provided. Canambra made a study of
alternative sources in which it was shown that the ideal alternative,
mixed hydro-thermal development, in which minimum cost hydro peaking would
be installed at existing stations to complement new thermal plant operated
at high load factor to yield power at system load factor at minimum cost,
would equalize Volta Grande at a discount rate of approximately 11%. This
is evidence of the low unit cost of Volta Grande and the comparatively
high cost of imported fuel oil, taxes excluded, in Brazil, amounting to
uS$o.46 per million Btu and is characteristic of hydroslectric sites in
the south-central region recomended for development by Canambra.
7. TARIFFS
7.01      In recent years many changes have occurred in Brazilian legis-
lation relating to tariffs for the power sector. Such changes were
brought about because of inflation in Brazil and the past inability of
electric utilities to obtain a reasonable rate of return. Thus they were
unable to generate a sufficient portion of funds necessary for normal
expansion of facilities. A detailed description of the tariff regulations
and other related subjects is included in Annex 9.
7.02      Under the present legislation, the system is working well. Most
of the major power utilities have been achieving a reasonable rate of re-
turn. As a result they are generating funds which are being used for con-
struction purposes and, with the assistance of additional funds fram the
Government and foreign loans, a broad expansion in the power sector is
taking place which is necessary to meet the increasing demands for power.



7.03      Revaluation of assets (see Annex 9, paragraph 4., which reflects
inflation, is now mandatory, but applications for tariff increases based
on such revaluations remain voluntary. The Bank is protected by three pro-
visions in existing and proposed Loan and Guarantee Agreements as follows:
(1) A requirement that Cemig will make applications for
rate adjustments, based on revaluations, within 5
months after the end of every calendar year so that
its rates will be sufficient to ensure operations
in accordance with sound financial and public
utility practice.
(2) A requirement that the Government of Brazil shall
cause agencies with jurisdiction over rates of
Cemig to act on rate applications within a period
of not more than 30 days after their receipt.
(3) An event of suspension and cancellation in case
the applicable legislation is changed materially
and adversely affecting the Borrower's business.
7.o4      In July 1966 and late in May 1967 and 1968, Cemig filed applica-
tions and received authorizations for rate increases based on revalued
assets.  Sales of Cemig are primarily to industry, which must be at com-
petitive levels and for resale as shown in Annex 3.
8. PAST OPERATIONS
8.01      Income statements for the three years 1965 through 1967 are shown
in Annex 10. During this period kwh sales increased from kwh 2,033 million
in 1965 to kwh 2,677 million in 1967 or 31%. Tariffs were increased in
1966 and 1967 following revaluation of assets. The average rate per kwh
increased from NCr$0.01427 in 1965 to NCr$0.02947 in 1967, or an increase
of about 106%. Operating expenses almost doubled reflecting inflation.
8.02      Operating income of Cemig and the rate of return earned on re-
munerable investment as defined in Annex 9 (paragraph 2) for the three
years were as follows:
Operating Income                Rate of
Year              (million NCr$)                  Return
1965                   7.8                          6.7%
1966                  18.9                          7.6
1967                  37.3                          9.2



8.03       Rates of return calculated in accordance with the test applied by
the Bank under Loan 442-BR to ascertain whether any changes in legislation
materially and adversely affect the financial position of Cemig, show returns
of 11.5% and 13.1% for the years 1966 and 1967 respectively. The Bank's
test is based on a minimum rate of return of ten per cent per annum calculated
as the percentage of operating income (adjusted for straight-line depre-
ciation at a three per cent rate and excluding income taxes and amortization
from cost of service) to the average of the revalued net fixed assets in
operation at the beginning and end of the year. Net fixed assets at the be-
ginning of the year are revalued on the basis of the coefficient applicable
to the value of such assets at December 31 of the prior year, and net fixed
assets in operation at the end of the year are revalued on the basis of the
coefficient applicable to December 31 of the current year. Rates of return
on remunerable investment calculated by Cemig for 1966 and 1967 are less
than returns calculated under the Bank's test, primarily because it charged
depreciation at a higher rate than three per cent (see Annex 9, paragraph 4),
provided for amortization charges in 1966, and included income taxes as a
cost of service.
8.04       Interest coverage averaged in excess of 4 times in the years
1965 through 1967 reflecting the low debt ratio and the large percentage
of foreign debt with an interest cost of six per cent or less.
9. PRESENT FINANCIAL POSITION
9.01       Financial statements of Cemig have been audited for a number of
years by the Brazilian branch of Arthur Andersen and Company, a United States
firm of Certified Public Accountants. These arrangements have been satis-
factory. In order to assure that adequate auditing continues in the future,
a covenant similar to that contained in existing loans requiring Cemig to
employ auditors acceptable to the Bank is included in the proposed Loan
Agreement.
9.02       The financial position of Cemig as of December 1967 is shown in
Annex 11. The summary balance sheets presented below show the actual
audited data and the effect of revaluing Cemig's accounts based on the
latest published coefficient and a foreign exchange rate of NCr$3.22 to
US$1.
9.03       In February 1968 the Government issued the coefficient of 1.22 for
revaluation purposes and Cemig revalued its assets accordingly in April 1968.
At the same time Cemig revalued its foreign loans on the basis of the ex-
change rate of NCr$2.715 to US$1 as of December 31, 1967.
9.04       The official foreign exchange rate of NCr$3.22 to US$1, as men-
tioned in Annex 9 (paragraph 4), although published on December 28, 1967,
was not effective until January 4, 1968. In order to show in this appraisal
report a more realistic financial position as of December 31, 1967, the
foreign loans were again revalued based on this exchange rate.
9.05       Total revalued fixed assets at December 31   1967 amount to NCr$527
million or about 85% of Cemig's total assets. Total fixed assets are 80%
higher than at the end of 1966. Of the increase of NCr$237 million in total
fixed assets, NCr$171 million or 72% resulted fram revaluations.

9.06       Cemig's balance sheets reflect a satisfactory financial position.
Actual balance sheets for the years 1965 through 1967 (see Annex 11) indi-
cate current ratios of from about 1½ to 1 up to 2 to 1.  Receivables have
borne a reasonable relationship tol26th of the revenues allowed as part
of remunerable investment as stated in Annex 9 (paragraph 2).
9.07       At December 31, 1967 Cemig's total equity was about NCr$455.7
million, about 74% of the total revalued assets. Included in the equity
is about NCr$53.0 million representing a revaluation reserve. This reserve,
resulting from revaluation of accounts, will be converted into share capital
in 196k by the issue of additional stock.
9.08       Total debt is NCr$121.8 million, classified as long-term debt of
NCr$1114. million and NCr$10.4 million as long-term debt due within one year.
A detailed schedule of individual loans is shown in Annex 12. Long-term debt
at December 31, 1967, was only about 23% of the total revalued fixed assets,
a conservative figure and far below the 66-2/3% debt limitation as provided
in Loan Agreement 442-BR. A similar debt limitation covenant is included
in the proposed Loan Agreement.
9.09       Included in long-term debt outstanding at December 31, 1967 are
foreign loans from AID and the Inter-American Development Bank, and local
loans from Banco Nacional do Desenvolvimento and Eletrobras which contain
restrictions in respect to Cemig incurring new loans or undertaking major
expansion. The AID Loan No. 512-L-01I4 requires that no future debt maturing
in more than 12 months shall be incurred without the authorization of AID.
The loan from Inter-American Development Bank No. OC-35 requires that any
major expansion programs must be approved by IDB. Loan 329 dated August 30,
1967 from Banco Nacional do Desenvolvimento has a requirement that future
incurrence of debt by Cemig must be approved by BNDE. A loan from Eletrobras
in connection with the construction of the Jaguara Power Project requires
its approval for loans in excess of 20% of the annual revenue of the borrower.
Based on revenues of NCr$78.9 million in 1967 this would permit a loan of less
than NCr$16 million to be issued without the approval of Eletrobras. The
proposed Bank loan for the Volta Grande Project at an exchange rate of
NCr$3.22 to US$1 amounts to NCr$85.7 million. Approvals have been obtained
from these four creditors.
10. PROPOSED FINANCING PLAN
10.01      A forecast of the source and application of funds for the eight-
year period 1968 through 1975 as shown in Annex 13, and the plan for financing
the expansion program over the period are summarized in the following table.
As shown in this table total funds required for this period are
estimated at about NCr$1,343.4 million.  Under the present expansion program,
construction expenditures excluding interest charged to construction are about
NCr$1,161.4 million, or about 86% of the funds required. The proposed Volta
Grande Project is estimated to cost about NCr$252.7 million or about 22% of
the construction expenditures. The estimated foreign and local costs of the
various projects comprising the expansion program are included in Annex 13.
The remainder balance of the required funds shown below consists of about
NCr$73.3 million for interest charged to construction and about NCr$108.7
million for increases in working capital and investments.

10.03     As shown in the above table and that on page 18, total borrowings
are estimated at NCr$456.6 or 34.0% of the funds to be obtained.  Of these
total borrowings, 36.3% is expected to be obtained from existing foreign
loans, 8.1% from existing local loans, 26.0% from future foreign loans, and
29.6% from proposed future local loans. The existing foreign loans with
interest rates between 5 and 64 were obtained from the Bank, suppliers,
Inter-American Development Bank, AID, and 2cport-Import Bank. The local
loans with interest rates between 5½ and 12% were obtained principally
from Eletrobras and Banco Nacional do Desenvolvimento.
10.04     Future foreign loans are expected to be obtained from two sources.
The major source is the proposed Bank Loan of NCr$85.7 million for the Volta
Grande Project. It was assumed that this loan would have a 6½ year grace
period, an 191 year amortization period and interest at 6½%. Foreign con-
struction expenditures of NCr$33.0 million in the years 1968-1971 are
assumed to be financed with future foreign suppliers' credits at an interest
rate of 6V,, and amortization over a 10-year period starting in the year 1972.



-20-
10.05     Local loans are estimated to total NCr$135 million at interest
rates between 10 per cent and 13%. Eletrobras has agreed to lend Cemig
NCr$50 million for transmission and distributIonexpansion.  Cemig has applied
to Banco Nacional do Desenvolvimento for a loan of NCr$30 million for
transmission and distribution expansion and plans to borrow NCr$55 million
from Eletrobras for financing a portion of the local cost of the Volta Grande
Project. Arrangements satisfactory to the Bank for these two loans are
conditiorsof effectiveness of the proposed Loan.
10.06     Detailed schedules of the annual interest and amortization payments
for all these loans have been included in Annex 14, Interest Schedule, and
Annex 15, Amortization Schedule. Capital requirements are heavy primarily
through the year 1972 but thereafter internal cash generation increases
substantially each year and construction declines. As a result, funds would
be available to prepay local loans most of which carry high interest rates.
10.07     Additional capital from the sale of shares during the eight-year
period ending December 31, 1975, estimated at NCr$266.6 million, is expected
to be obtained from three principal sources. Investment by the State of
Minas Gerais of its share of the sole tax received from the Federal Government
amounts to NCr$163.7.  Of this total, NCr$12.7 million is estimated to be
received in 1968 including in part the arrears in the 1967 payments by the
Federal Government mentioned in Annex 9 (paragraph 6). Assurances are pro-
vided in the proposed Project Agreement that the State of Minas Gerais shall
invest in capital stock of Cemig proceeds of the sole tax allocated to the
State. The second source of share capital totaling NCr$76.0 million repre-
sents estimated investment by public shareholders comprised of customers who
purchase shares in connection with the extension of electric service and
insurance companies which are required to invest a portion of their funds
in securities of certain approved Brazilian companies including Cemig. The
third source is Eletrobras which is projected to invest NCr$16.9 million for
the Jaguara Project as required by Loan Agreement No. 442-BR and NCr$10.0
million to maintain its interest of not less than 16 per cent in shares of
Cemig as provided in the proposed Loan Agreement. In addition, Cemig expects
to receive annual federal grants for minor extensions of service amounting
to NCr$32 million.
10.08     The proposed financial plan is reasonable. Moreover, assurances
are provided in the proposed Project Agreement that in the event of shortage
of funds the State of Nlinas Gerais would provide Cemig with the necessary
funds to carry out the Volta Grande Project.
11. ESTIMATED FUTURE OPERATIONS
11.01     Forecast income statements for the eight-year period 1968 through
1975 are included in Annex 10. This forecast is based on the assumption
that Cemig achieves the permitted rate of return of ten per cent on its
remunerable investment. Foreign exchange expenditures have been cast in
terms of the official foreign exchange rate of NCr$3.22 to US$1 effective
January 4, 1968. Normal increases in operating costs have been considered,
but no provision has been made for future loss of value of the cruzeiro as



-21-
most of the effects are provided for under the tariff arrangements and
adjustments for inflation (see Annex 9, paragraph 3). Depreciation is
forecast at a three per cent rate which is reasonable.
11.02     The basis of the estimates of kwh to be sold are set forth in
paragraphs 6.01-6.07, inclusive. The average rate per kwh is forecast to
increase from NCr$0.295 in 1967 to NCr$0.03893 in 1968 primarily because of
tariff increases resulting from the April 1968 revaluation of assets and
higher costs of purchased power. The average rate per kwh is expected to
increase in 1969 in part because of higher costs of purchased power. There-
after, the estimated average rate per kwh is stable for a number of years.
Projected operating income increases particularly in the years 1971, 1972
and 1973, reflecting the higher remunerable investment.
11.03     Interest coverage is consistently satisfactory from 2.6 times in
1970 to an average of almost 4 times.  Share capital should increase sub-
stantially, reflecting sales of shares for cash, stock dividends for the 81%
of the shares owtned by the State of Minas Gerais and Eletrobras, and NCr$53.0
million transferred from revaluation reserve.
12.  CONCLUSIONS
12.01     The Project is technically sound and will provide facilities
necessary to meet the expected demand for power. Estimates of cost are
reasonable and arrangements for engineering construction and procurement
are appropriate. The financing plans are satisfactory.
12.02     Cemig is operating satisfactorily and has made good progress in
improving staff, organization and methods.
12.03     The Project would be suitable for a Bank loan of US$26.6 million
equivalent for 25 years including a grace period of 6½2 years.

VOLTA GRANDE PROJECT
Internal Rate of Return
1.        The internal rate of return of the Volta Grande project was
determined as follows and is the discount rate at which the present
worth of the cost of the project equals the present worth of the
revenue produced by it over its life.
2.        For this purpose the pertinent information is as follows:
A. The capital cost of the project is shown in Annex 14.
To this has been added the cost of transmission/distribu-
tion facilities which would be provided to distribute
the output of Volta Grande, amounting to 180 million NCr.
B. The life of the project is 40 years.
C. The annual net revenue is the annual gross revenue less
operating costs. Annual gross revenue is equal to the
annual kilowatt hours sales attributed to the project
multiplied by the applicable tariff.
D. The annual kilowatt hours were determined by appor-
tioning the total sales of Cemig to the respective
plants in accordance with the estimated operating con-
ditions and are estimated at 1.50 billion kwh for
Volta Grande. This would entail operating at about the
firm plant factor of Volta Grande and is conservative
given that during normal hydrological years the output
would be somewhat higher.
E.  The tariff employed is 0.043 NCr. per kilowatt hour
corresponding to that estimated for 1972. This is
slightly less than that estimated for the immediately
following years, when the project commences operation,
and is on the conservative side. Annual gross revenue
amounts to 64.5 million NCr.
F. Gross operating expenses were determined as 11.9 mil-
lion NCr. annually. They include the cost of operating
Volta Grande and, additionally, the cost of operating
the distribution facilities over which Volta Grande
power would be supplied. The latter was determined by
apportioning operating costs between generation/trans-
miEsion and distribution and, in turn, apportioning the
distribution cost among the various hydroelectric sta-
tions in proportion to the sales attributable to each.



ANNEX o

3.        On the basis of the above it was determined that the present
worth of capital costs would equal the present worth of the revenues
over a forty year period at a discount rate of 10.2p.

ANNEX 9
Page I
BRAZIL
CENTRAIS ELETRICAS DE MINAS GERAIS, S.A.
Tariffs
1.        Regulations governing tariffs are contained in the Water
Code of 1934, subsequent amendments and decrees including decrees
dated February 26, 1957 and November 4, 1964 and Law 5,073 enacted on
August 18, 1966. Prior to 1964, tariffs were based on the use of the
historic value of investment, thereby not reflecting the substantial
inflation that occurred in Brazil. The 1964 decree allows utilities to
revalue their investments to reflect changes in price levels. The 1966
legislation made yearly revaluations of assets mandatory.
2,        Under the existing regulations, tariffs are reviewed and ap-
proved by the Waters Division of the Ministry of Mines and Energy every
three years or at shorter intervals at the initiative of the Waters
Division or the utility. Utilities are permitted to apply for tariffs
which would yield revenues covering (a) operating costs including income
taxes; (b) straight-line depreciation of gross fixed assets in opera-
tion, excluding land and land rights, at annual rates of up to eight per
cent for thermal plants and up to five per cent for all other facilities
including hydro plants, but with no minima in either case; (c) a rever-
sion provision of three per cent or an amortization provision of up to
five per cent on the total gross fix dAssets in.'operation; and (d) a
return of ten per cent on the remunerable investment. Remunerable
investment is defined as the book value of the estimated end-of-year
gross plant in service (excluding assets acquired through contributions
in aid of construction) less depreciation and reversion or amortization
reserves, plus reversion or amortization funds and an end-of-year allowance
for working capital consisting of materials and supplies, receivables
equivalent to two months' billings, and cash (up to the reserve for
depreciation balance) excluding cash representing contributions in aid
of construction. In principle, shortfalls in achieving the return of
ten per cent in the three-year tariff period may be recovered in the
subsequent three-year period. However, another provision in the regu-
lations permits tariff adjustments for recovering shortfalls at more
frequent intervals.
3.        Without advance approval of the Water Division, surcharges
between tariff revisions may be added by utilities to their current
tariffs to cover compulsory increases in wages, social benefits, cost
of fuel and purchased power, and for increases in foreign debt service
due to changes in the foreign exchange rate. In 1966 Cemig added
surcharges to its tariffs in October for increases in the cost of energy
purchased and in December for increases in wages. In March 1967 ad-
justments were made for increases in the cost of foreign exchange.
Further adjustments were made in January 1968 for increases in wages
and in February 1968 for changes in costs of foreign exchange and in
energy purchased. The changes in cost of foreign exchange reflect the
higher debt service on foreign loans based on the official exchange
rate of NCr$3.22 to US$1.



ANNEX 9
Page 2
4.        Tariff adjustments on account of revaluation of balance sheet
accounts can be made as often as economic correction factors (coeffi-
cients) showing the variations in the price level are published. The
coefficients are issued annually about one or two months after the end
of each year for the use of industry in general. The coefficients
are applied by utilities to up-date the values of plant in service,
depreciation and amortization or reversion reserves, and certain local
currency loans of the Banco Nacional do Desenvolvimento and Eletrobras.
Increased tariffs resulting from revaluation of assets based on coeffi-
cients do not, however, completely offset the effects of inflation. In
any given year construction expenditures incurred in the immediate
prior year are not revalued. Furthermore, the effects of inflation in
the current year are not recognized because utility plant is revalued
as of the beginning of that year. In addition, no price level adjust-
ment is made for shortfalls in earnings which are to be recovered in
succeeding years. Foreign currency components of the book value of
fixed assets are converted into local currency at the rate of exchange
in effect at the time the assets are acquired. At the same time as the
application of the coefficient to all of its plant account which can be
revalued, Cemig adjusts its foreign debts to the official exchange
rates in effect. This adjustment as of December 31, 1967 did not
reflect the full amount of the liability on foreign debts because the
rate of NCr$3.22 to US$1, although published on December 28, 1967, was
not effective until January 4., 1968.  The higher cost of debt service
on foreign loans because of this change in exchange rates was provided
in a surcharge. As offsets to these factors, it must be recognized that
cost of service for a given year is related to remunerable investment
as of the end of the year and that both cost of service (which includes
taxes on income) and remunerable investment are based on estimated
projections. Furthermore, as indicated in paragraph 2 above, liberal
allowances are permitted for depreciation and amortization. Effective
July 1, 1967, depreciation charges of Cemig amounted to approximately
five per cent of depreciable plant compared with about four per cent
in 1966.
5.        In addition to a basic tariff and surcharges, consumers pay
three other charges. The Federal Government levies two charges to
raise additional resources for the financing of power development, a
tax called the Imposto Unico (sole tax), which varies among consumer
classes, and the Emprestito Compulsorio (compulsory loan), which is
equal in amount to the sole tax. These amount to some 20-25% of the
charge for service except for certain groups (such as rural users)
who are exempt. The proceeds of the sole tax, which was first imposed
in 1954, are distributed after retention of five per cent by the
Ministry of Finance, as follows: 39% to the Federal Electrification
Fund, administered by Eletrobras; 50% to the States; ten per cent
to the municipalities; and one per cent to the Ministry of Mines and
Energy to cover collection costs. The compulsory loan, introduced
in 1962 and scheduled to be discontinued at the end of 1973, is ad-
ministered by Eletrobras and the proceeds are invested in power
projects as share capital or as loans generally with a 13% effective
rate of interest. Consumers receive debt certificates for the amount



ANNEX 9
Page 3
of the compulsory loan; the certificates are revalued annually, pay six
per cent interest, and are repayable in 20 years. Finally, the total
rate for power includes a social security tax amounting to ten per cent
of the charge for service.
6.        There has been a delay in the receipt by the State of Minas
Gerais of its portion of the sole tax which is invested in shares of
Cemig. Under the new federal constitution of January 24, 1967, the
Minister of Finance was charged with the responsibility of developing
a new formula for determining the distribution of these funds. The
distribution of this portion of the sole tax is now based on the fol-
lowing proportions: 60% - population, 20% - size of territory,
15% - consumption of electricity, three per cent - reservoir area,
two per cent - electricity produced. Considerable time took place in
arriving at this new formula with the result that payments which
normally would have been made by the Federal Government in 1967 were
deferred unti' 1968 when they are scheduled to be paid in 10 install-
ments.
