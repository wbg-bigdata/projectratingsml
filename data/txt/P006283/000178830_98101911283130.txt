BRAZIL: APPRAISAL OF ELETROSUL TRANSMISSION PROJECT
CENTRAIS ELETRICAS DO SUL DO BRASIL S.A. (ELETROSUL)
Summary and Conclusion
i.        This report covers the appraisal of an extra high voltage (EHV)
transmission project forming a part of the 1976-81 expansion program of
Centrais Eletricas do Sul do Brasil (ELETROSUL) to meet the electric power
requirements of the Southern and part of the Southeastern regions of Brazil;
and a training program to meet identified high-level skill needs in the
Brazilian power sector. ELETROSUL, a bulk supplier in the Southern region
and a subsidiary of Centrais Eletricas Brasileiras (ELETROBRAS), the Govern-
ment-owned holding corporation and executing agency for the Brazilian electric
program, has requested financial assistance of US$82.0 million from the Bank
to carry out the project. The loan would be the second to ELETROSUL. The
first loan of US$70 million (Loan No. 728-BR of 1971) financed ELETROSUL's
first major hydro project at Salto Osorio, which was commissioned on schedule
in March 1976.
ii.       The Brazilian power sector is well organized and managed.  The
National Department of Water and Electric Energy (DNAEE) performs the regu-
latory functions and ELETROBRAS discharges the planning, technical coordina-
tion, financing, and administrative functions, both under the jurisdiction of
the Ministry of Mines and Energy (MME). Power generation and high voltage
transmission is concentrated in a few specialized utilities such as ELETROSUL;
and distribution is the responsibility of state-owned and a few privately-owned
utilities. The tariff system, which provides for a reasonable return on
annually revalued assets, has produced the massive consumer-based resource
mobilization required to support the sector's impressive growth in installed
capacity.
iii.      ELETROSUL's 1976-81 expansion program is estimated to cost the equiv-
alent of US$1,151 million in December 1975 prices. The financing required
prior to 1978 for the program has been arranged except for an estimated US$54
million which ELETROSUL is seekig the Bank's assistance to secure from co-
financing sources to cover foreign expenditures on works in the program out-
side of the Bank project. While these works have not been appraised in detail,
they constitute a rational, integrated program to meet the growing market
requirements of the Southern region and to avert deficits anticipated for the
Southeastern region beginning in 1981.
iv.       The project proposed for Bank financing is estimated to cost
US$212.5 million, with a foreign exchange cost of US$84.0 million of which the
U.S. EXIMBANK is providing US$1.7 million (about 2%) for engineering services.
The proposed Bank loan would cover the remaining 98% foreign exchange require-
ment. The local costs would be covered by contributions from power sector
customers and loans from local financial institutions.



- ii -
v.        The proceeds of the Bank loan would finance equipment and the
foreign cost of consulting services and the training program for the sector.
Procurement of equipment required for the project would be through interna-
tional competitive bidding in accordance with the Bank's Guidelines for
Procurement. Brazilian suppliers of equipment financed by the proposed loan,
whose bids contain components manufactured in Brazil equal to at least 50% of
the value of the bid, would be given a margin of preference of 15% or the
applicable import duties, whichever is lower. It is expected that approxi-
mately 50% of the contracts would be won by Brazilian contractors.
vi.       The project is technically sound and economically justified.
ELETROSUL would carry out the transmission component while ELETROBRAS would
execute the sector-wide training program component. The transmission compo-
nent would integrate the power systems of the Southern and Southeastern regions
of Brazil (which currently provide more than 80% of Brazil's electric power),
and enable the combined system to improve its generation capability by about
1,600 average MW annually beginnning in 1981. It would also provide the first
phase of an EHV grid in the South -- a crucial element in the Federal Govern-
ment's strategy to increasingly site heavy industry in the Southern region
rather than in the already much industrialized Southeast. It would also
ensure electric services to a wider spectrum of the population. The economic
rate of return on the investments in the transmission component (about 91% of
the total project cost) would be 27%,    The training program component, whose
investments constitute 9% of the total project cost, was excluded from the
analysis because its benefits are not quantifiable. The program would benefit
the entire sector by providing high-level skills to meet the needs arising
from the expansion of the interconnected system.
vii.      The project's engineering would be performed by Montreal Engenharia
S. A., a qualified Brazilian consulting group. Project supervision would be
performed by ELETROSUL with some assistance from consultants, if required.
ELETROSUL is capable of executing its portion of the project. The utility
is managed efficiently, and has competent professional personnel, many of whom
have been with the organization since its inception in 1968. ELETROSUL would
on-lend US$4.3 million of the loan proceeds to ELETROBRAS on the same terms
as the Bank loan to meet the training component's foreign exchange cost.
ELETROBRAS has a Manpower Training Department with qualified staff capable of
executing this portion of the project.
viii.     Although ELETROSUL's financial management has been efficient, its
financial performance was relatively unsatisfactory through 1974. However,
ELETROSUL reduced its costs in 1975 and achieved a satisfactory rate of
return. The utility's performance is expected to continue to be good during
the construction of the Bank project (1976-81) and its financial rate of
return during the period is expected to average about 14%.
ix.       The project would form a suitable basis for a Bank loan of US$82.0
million, repayable over 17 years with 3-1/2 years of grace.



BRAZIL: APPRAISAL OF ELETROSUL TRANSMISSION PROJECT
CENTRAIS ELETRICAS DO SUL DO BRASIL S.A. (ELETROSUL)
1.   Introduction
1.01      Centrais Eletricas do Sul do Brasil S. A. (ELETROSUL), the subsid-
iary of the Government-owned Centrais Eletricas Brasileiras (ELETROBRAS) in
charge of electric power bulk supply in the Southern region of Brazil, has
asked for the Bank's assistance to finance: (i) the construction of extra
high voltage (EHV) transmission facilities to interconnect the power systems
of the Southern and Southeastern regions and the first phase of 500 kV trans-
mission facilities in the Southern region; and (ii) a training program for
power sector personnel.
1.02      The interconnection of the two power systems would enable the com-
bined system to improve its electric power production capability, allowing
Brazil to achieve substantial reductions in fuel imports at a relatively
modest capital cost. The first phase of the 500 kV transmission system in
the Southern region would complement investments aided by previous lending
from the Bank (COPEL Distribution Project, Loan 1257-BR) and the Inter-American
Development Bank (IDB) designed to assist the industrial decentralization
policy of the Brazilian Government by participating in the expansion of the
region's power infrastructure. The training program component, which would
be executed by ELETROBRAS under a subsidiary loan agreement, would provide
highly specialized skills to selected personnel from various utilities in
the sector. Such skills are needed because of the expansion of the intercon-
nected system which requires the application of new technologies associated
with EHV transmission and the introduction of regional load dispatching centers.
1.03      The proposed EHV project is part of ELETROSUL's 1976-81 capital
investment program consisting of integrated works designed to meet the electric
power requirements of the Southern region and part of the Southeastern region
during 1981-90. The estimated cost of this program in December 1975 prices
is about US$1,151 million equivalent. The project proposed for Bank financing
is estimated to cost US$212.5 million (in current prices).
1.04      The proposed Bank loan of US$82 million would cover 98% of the
foreign cost of the proposed project. The remaining 2% of the foreign cost is
being provided by the U.S. EXIMBANK in an amount of US$1.7 million. ELETROSUL
has also requested the Bank's assistance to raise US$54 million from co-finan-
cing sources to meet a foreign exchange gap of equivalent amount in the 1976-81
capital investment program. The Bank has indicated its willingness to assist
should this result in better terms for the borrower.
1.05      The proposed loan would be the second made by the Bank to ELETROSUL.
Loan 728-BR (US$70 million) made in 1971 supported the utility's first major
hydro generation project, Salto Osorio (initial capacity 700 MW). Its con-
struction was on schedule in spite of higher-than-forecast price increases



- 2 -
which resulted in about 80% cost overrun. Because of greater increases in the
cost of alternative sources of energy, this overrun did not affect the justi-
fication of the project. The first two units (350 MW) were commissioned in
March 1976 and the remaining two units are expected to be ready for service
by December 1976.
1.06      This report is based on a feasibility study of the project prepared
by ELETROSUL and on the findings of an appraisal mission consisting of
Messrs. Bernard Montfort and Isaac Sam (Bank staff) and Messrs. Bernardo
Bronstein and M. J. Reis (Consultants) who visited Brazil in March 1976, and
on the findings of Mr. E.H. Chittleburgh (Bank staff) who visited Brazil in
August 1976 to review the power sector's training program.

2.   The Power Sector
Energy Resources
2.01      Energy supply in Brazil is derived from three sources:  oil products,
wood and waste products and hydroelectricity.  Oil products account for 50%
of national energy consumption, wood and waste products 27% and hydroelectri-
city 20% (Annex 1).  The estimated total gross consumption of energy in Brazil
in 1975 in oil equivalent was 107,880 M.T.o.e. (0.99 T.o.e. per capita) 1/ and
it is expected to grow at about 8% p.a. in the next five years, reaching about
1.26 T.o.e. per capita in 1980.
2.02      Brazil's proven oil reserves are limited.  Present domestic produc-
tion of crude covers only 18% of the country's requirements and is concentrated
in the Northeast. To increase domestic production, the Government intends to
accelerate prospection. To this end the Government is seeking to attract the
participation of foreign firms in the exploration and possible exploitation
of oil reserves in certain areas. Bituminous and sub-bituminous coal reserves,
which are located in the South, are estimated at 3,200 million tons. Coal
extraction is rather costly because shaft mining is predominantly required.
Brazil is well endowed with hydroelectric resources. The hydroelectric poten-
tial is currently estimated at about 150,000 MW, one of the largest in the
world, of which less than 11% has been utilized so far. Further economic
utilization of these resources would require installation of a proportion of
complementary non-hydro generating capacity. To this end, 3,000 MW of nuclear
generating capacity are expected to be in operation in the Southeastern region
by 1987. Gross consumption of electric energy in 1975 was 80,000 GWh (25% of
total energy consumption) and has increased at a rate of 12.3% p.a. during the
last five years. Current per capita consumption of electric energy is esti-
mated at 739 kWh, compared to 780 kWh in Mexico and 2,650 kWh in Japan.
Electric Power Consumption - Southern and Southeastern Regions
2.03      The Southern region, with 18% of Brazil's population, accounted for
about 12% of the total electric energy consumption of the country in 1975.
The Southeastern region, with 43% of the country's population consumed 76% of
the total electric energy in 1975.  The two regions combined, with 61% of the
population, consumed 88%. Electric energy consumption in the Southern region
has grown at a rate of 15.2% in the last five years, reaching a consumption
per capita of 570 kWh in 1975.  The region's consumption is expected to grow
at an average rate of 12.7% p.a. in the next ten years reaching a per capita
consumption of 1,375 kWh in 1985. In the Southeastern region, consumption has
been growing at a rate of 11.2% p.a. in the last five years, reaching a con-
sumption per capita of 1480 kWh in 1975. Consumption there is expected to
grow at 9.6% p.a. in the next ten years reaching a per capita consumption of
2,700 kWh in 1985.

Power Sector Organization
2.04      The legal, technical and administrative structure of the electric
power in Brazil is established by Decree 68,204 of June 7, 1967, which defines
the structure as consisting of the National Department of Water and Electric
Energy (DNAEE), ELETROBRAS and the various federal, state, municipal, and
private concessionaires, all under the jurisdiction of the Ministry of Mines
and Energy (MME). DNAEE performs regulatory functions including the granting
of licenses for hydroelectric sites, assignment of concession areas, setting
of tariffs and approving of expansion plans. ELETROBRAS, which operates as
an executing agency under the jurisdiction of the MME and in coordination with
DNAEE, performs the functions of: (a) holding company for those utilities
where the Government has acquired financial control, (b) financial institution
administering and allocating public funds among its subsidiaries and electric
utilities owned by state governments and coordinating sector borrowings from
abroad, and (c) coordinating and consulting group assisting the development of
the country's electrification programs by providing technical, managerial and
training services.
2.05      In accordance with Government policy, the power generation function
is reserved largely to four of ELETROBRAS' subsidiaries which cover Brazil's
five natural regions. They are Centrais Eletricas do Norte do Brasil
(ELETRONORTE) covering the North and part of the Center-West, Companhia Hidro
Eletrica do Sao Francisco (CHESF) covering the Northeast, Furnas - Centrais
Eletricas (FURNAS) covering the Southeast and part of the Center-West, and
Centrais Eletricas do Sul do Brasil (ELETROSUL) covering the South. A joint
Brazilian-Paraguayan entity, Itaipu Binacional, is responsible for the Itaipu
hydroelectric project located on the Parana river on the border with Paraguay.
2.06      The transmission function in Brazil is presently shared between the
federally-owned bulk suppliers and the state-owned utilities. Extra high
voltage transmission (750 and 500 kV) is the responsibility of the federal
utilities; medium voltage transmission (138 kV) is largely handled by the
state utilities; and responsibility for high voltage transmission (230 kV)
is shared. To avoid the proliferation of transmission and distribution
voltages, the Federal Government, after studies by ELETROBRAS, issued Decree
73,080 of November 1973 establishing the following standard voltage levels
for the country: 750, 500, 230, 138, 69, 34.5 and 13.8 kV.
2.07      To maximize the economic benefits to the country from operation of
the generating and transmission facilities, the Federal Government, in
November of 1973 issued Decree 73,102 establishing the Grupos Coordenadores
para Operacao Interligada (GCOI). The GCOI was charged with coordinating and
directing the operations of the individual generating plants and transmission
systems to attain the maximum efficiency for the whole system from financial
and operating points of view. There are now two such groups: the large and
very well organized group for the Southeastern and Southern regions; and the
smaller group for the Northeastern region. The Superior Council of GCOI is
composed of the Presidents of ELETROBRAS and of the individual concessionaires.
The Executive Committee of GCOI is composed of the Directors of operations of



- 5 -
the same entities, thus bringing the maximum authority of the entities into
direct control of activities. Under the Decree, a special compensation
account called Contas do Custo dos Combustives (CCC) has been established
by ELETROBRAS to which all concessionaires contribute the cost of their
quotas of fuel consumption assigned by the GCOI and from which they receive
funds at the end of the year to offset their actual fuel expenses. In the
two years of its existence, the South-Southeast GCOI has become very success-
ful in directing the operations of the interconnected system and now has the
complete support of the concessionaires who realized the advantages of coor-
dinated operations.
2.08      Also, in accordance with Government policy, the power distribution
function at the state level is carried out mainly by utilities controlled by
the state governments. In line with this policy, there have been in recent
years a number of acquisitions and mergers of smaller municipally-and-privately-
owned distribution companies by state-owned utilities as well as transfers to
them of some of ELETROBRAS' subsidiaries engaged in distribution. Today, with
the exception of the Rio de Janeiro and Sao Paulo areas which are served prin-
cipally by Light-Servicos de Eletricidade, S.A. (LIGHT), a privately-owned
enterprise, most of the power distribution is made through one company in each
state. The main distribution companies (over 500 GWh in 1975) in the South-
eastern region are: CESP ( Sao Paulo), CEMIG (Minas Gerais), LIGHT (Rio and
Sao Paulo), CPFL (Sao Paulo), ESCELSA (Espirito Santo), CBEE/CELF (Rio de
Janeiro State), CELG (Goias) and CEB (Brasilia); in the Southern region they
are: COPEL (Parana), CELESC (Santa Catarina) and CEEE (Rio Grande do Sul).
2.09      The manpower needs of the various generating and distribution com-
panies are adequately covered by well co-ordinated recruitment and training
programs in universities and 27 training centers located in all regions of the
country. However, needs are arising for relatively small numbers of highly
specialized personnel to deal with problems resulting from the expanding
interconnected system and the emergence of new technologies associated with
extra high voltage transmission and the introduction of regional load dispatch-
ing centers. ELETROBRAS, with its overall responsibility for the effective
operation of the power sector has recognized this need, and has requested the
Bank to finance the foreign costs of a comprehensive training program aimed at
meeting the specialist manpower requirements of the sector into the foreseeable
future. The total estimated cost of the training program is US$15.4 million
equivalent, with a US$4.3 million foreign exchange component. With a training
department consisting of 47 persons, 30 of whom are graduates in electrical
engineering or economics, ELETROBRAS has the capability to coordinate this pro-
gram, and to select suitable trainees from the various companies. Full details
of the training program and a cost breakdown appear in Annex 17.
2.10      Sector planning and development is carried out by ELETROBRAS, which
has been issuing multiannual budgets for the sector (OPE) 1/ which cover five-
year periods and are revised and updated annually, since 1968. These budgets
enable ELETROBRAS and the Government to select projects to meet anticipated
1/   Orcamento Plurianual do Sector de Energia Eletrica.

demand and to provide adequate financial support for them. Because the OPEs
contain information regarding equipment requirements, they also afford manu-
facturers of eletrical equipment opportunities for better planning of their
activities.
2.11      The methodology for selection of projects is satisfactory.  To
determine which facilities would be economical to meet projected market
requirements of a given period, ELETROBRAS simulates the existing generation
and transmission system plus a combination of potential hydro, conventional
thermal and nuclear systems, and selects the particular combination which
minimizes total costs to supply the market.
The South-Southeastern Electric Energy Market, 1976-90
2.12      In connection with Loan 923-BR (Itumbiara Hydroelectric Project),
the Brazilian Government agreed in 1973 to prepare and submit to the Bank for
comment plans for expanding generation and major transmission facilities in
the Southeastern and Southern regions in two stages: the first covering the
period through 1981 and the second through 1990. The least-cost generation
and transmission program for the first of these periods was reviewed by
the Bank in 1974 and found to be satisfactory. It included two projects
currently under construction in the Southern region: ELETROSUn's Salto
Santiago project (first stage, 1,332 MW, ultimate capacity 1,995 MW) and
COPEL's Foz do Areia project (first stage, 1,125 MW, ultimate capacity 2,250
MW). The Inter-American Bank (IDB) has approved loans to ELETROSUL and COPEL
to finance a part of the foreign cost of these projects.
2.13      The plans for the period till 1990 were submitted in 1975.  However,
the economic growth projections on which the electric energy market forecasts
of the two regions were based were higher than now appears probable. ELETROBRAS
has revised the study to take into account the impact of the 1973-74 recession
and the goals of the Federal Government's Second National Development Plan
which gives priority to mining and capital goods industry, and the increasing
siting of heavy industry in the Southern region rather than the much indus-
trialized Southeastern region. Although in absolute terms all classes of con-
sumers would increase their consumption, in both regions the fastest growth in
consumption would be in the industrial sector. Following is a table summariz-
ing actual consuinption and growth in the last five years and the consumption
and growth during 1976-90 as projected by ELETROBRAS. Details are shown in
Annex 2 (Tables 1 to 6).

2.14      Annex 3 shows an alternative forecast.  This projection which takes
into account recent lower Brazilian GNP growth, results in approximately 1 year's
delay in the load growth of the Southeastern region during 1980-84. The lower
projection was used in the sensitivity analysis of the economic justification of
the project (see Section 5 and Annex 15).
South-Southeast Electric Power Development Program, 1981-90
2.15      The ELETROBRAS program for the period 1981-90 (para. 2.12) is divided
into two 5-year time spans: (i) 1981-1985, which includes projects which have
either been started or which will start in the course of the next year or two,
and (ii) 1986-1990, which is to be reexamined and adjusted to match changes
in future power demand when these are more clearly defined. About 20,800MW
generating capacity is expected to be added to the two regions' 1976 installed
capacity during 1977-87, of which 17,200MW would be hydro, 3,000 MW nuclear
and the balance conventional thermal capacity (Annex 4, Tables 2 and 3).
Table 4 of Annex 4 contains projections of energy and peak availabilities in the



- 8 -
Southern and Southeastern regions for 1976-1987.  The increase in availabi-
lity detailed in Annex 4 includes 1612 MW average energy gain for the combined
firm energy capability of the South-Southeast system as a result of the
interconnection component of the project. This gain arises because the two
regions have different hydrological seasons and multi-annual complementary
characteristics. Details of this gain are shown in Annex 5.
2.16      The main factor (other than the load forecast, para. 2.13) under-
lying the program is the initial operation of Itaipu. The project is larger
than any undertaken to date in the Western Hemisphere in hydroelectric deve-
lopment. ELETROBRAS currently expects Itaipu to be commissioned by 1984.
Energy Balances
2.17      Annex 6 is a summary of the market requirements and the power avail-
ability of the two regions. According to the projections, between 1976-80, the
Southern region would be facing some deficits; these can be met from surpluses
available in the Southeast during the same period through an existing 230 kV
line. Beginning 1981 when Foz do Areia and Salto Santiago hydro plants come
into operation, the situation would be reversed with the Southern region having
surpluses and the Southeastern region facing substantial deficits 1/. The EHV
interconnection included in the proposed project is required to transfer the
surpluses in the Southern region to meet the deficits in the Southeastern
region because the existing 230 kV line would not be adequate for the transfers,
nor would 230 kV lines be economical for the amount of energy to be transferred.
Electric Power Tariffs
2.18      Since 1964 Brazilian electric power tariff legislation requires that
utilities cover operating expenses (excluding financial charges), depreciation,
reversion 2/ and earn a statutory return 3/ of 10% to 12% on investment based
1/   The higher ELETROBRAS market forecast (para. 2.13) for the Southeastern
region results in larger deficits for that region during 1981-84. The
present estimates of surpluses in the South during that period would not
be sufficient to cover the larger deficits based on the higher market
requirements. ELETROBRAS, therefore, is considering advancing the con-
struction of an additional hydro plant (Salto Segredo, 924 MW average
firm energy) to be located in the South on the Iguacu river between Salto
Santiago and Foz do Areia to supplement the projected surpluses in the
South. The probable in-service date for this plant would be 1982/83, and
its output together with the present estimate of surpluses in the South
during 1981-84 would be sufficient to meet Southeastern deficits were
that region's market to grow as forecast by ELETROBRAS.
2/   A special electric power sector tax.  Refer to Annex 7 for details.
3/   Because of the inclusion of reversion in its calculation and the use of
year end, rather than average values, the statutory return is not compa-
rable to the rates of return on average net fixed assets in operation
commonly used in appraisals of public utilities.



- 9 -
on annually revalued assets as required by law.  This system has been the
cornerstone of the rapid growth of the sector.
2.19      DNAEE has in recent years used its discretionary powers to achieve
progressive equalization of customer rates throughout Brazil, a Government
policy enacted into law in 1974. While the financial and social objectives
of this policy are appreciated, the Bank and the Brazilian Government have
agreed that its economic effects should be analyzed. Because the rate equali-
zation was effected by granting lower tariff increases to the comparatively
higher cost utilities, it resulted in some erosion of tariffs in real terms
and adversely affected their rates of return. Although the shortfalls were
carried forward in the utilities' accounts to be offset over time against
future surplus returns, this practice resulted in some liquidity problems
for the power sector. (See para. 6.02 for its effect on ELETROSUL during
1972-75).
2.20      The Government took action in 1975 to resolve these problems, by
raising tariffs and establishing the Global Guarantee Fund, a cross-subsidiza-
tion mechanism intended to assure qualifying utilities a statutory return of
10%. This mechanism is funded by an increase in reversion charges to supple-
ment the tariff revenues of qualifying utilities. DNAEE put into effect
a number of measures to improve qualifying utilities' operating efficiency.
ELETROSUL received a small transfer from the Global Guarantee Fund in 1975,
but its financing plan is based on the assumption that it will not require
any further transfers from the Fund prior to project completion. However,
ELETROSUL has agreed to maintain its eligibility for such transfers, in the
event it would be necessary for it to receive them, by complying with DNAEE
guidelines.
2.21      As under previous loans to the Brazilian power sector, ELETROSUL has
agreed to maintain its earnings (including transfers from the Global Guarantee
Fund) at levels consistent with appropriate financial and public utility prac-
tices and in accordance with existing legislation. The Government has agreed
to have DNAEE take timely action on ELETROSUL's applications for tariff
adjustments or transfers. The Government also agreed to confirm the Bank's
understanding that DNAEE will exercise its discretionary powers to allow
ELETROSUL the minimum statutory return of 10%. Any change in legislation
which would materially and adversely affect ELETROSUL's financial position,
should be regarded as an event of default.
Tariff Structure
2.22      The present tariff schedule is basically rational and simple, and it
results in a high level of resource mobilization while discouraging non-
essential use of electricity. Tariffs charged to large industrial consumers
consist of a sizeable (approximately 58% of the revenue from medium and high-
voltage supply) capacity charge and a relatively low energy charge, reflecting
the cost structure of Brazil's predominantly hydroelectric generating capacity.
Tariffs charged to medium and large-scale urban residential and commercial



- 10 -
consumers are among the highest in the world (after considering the surcharges
which these customers must pay) and should discourage any non-essential con-
sumption. Small urban consumers and rural consumers are given a discount.
The levels of charges to all important consumer categories would appear to be
well above long-run marginal cost. This should help prevent the adoption of
labor-saving processes in cases in which they are not economically justified,
a frequennt occurrence in countries which subsidize industrial electricity
consumption.
2.23      Bank staff has been asssisting DNAEE and ELETROBRAS in preparing a
study of electricity tariffs throughout Brazil. The study should allow the
Government to assess the desirability of modifying the tariffs to ensure that
their level and structure achieve an appropriate balance in pursuing the
various sector objectives, namely financial, social, and economic. (For fur-
ther details see report No. 1088b-BR - Northeast Power Distribution Project,
dated June 10, 1976).

3.   The Borrower
3.01      The borrower would be ELETROSUL.  As indicated in paragraph 2.05,
ELETROSUL is responsible for electric bulk energy supply development in the
Southern region of Brazil (comprising the states of Parana, Santa Catarina
and Rio Grande do Sul) and interconnecting the electric energy systems of
these states with high voltage systems compatible with the system in other
regions of Brazil. ELETROSUL was established in December 1968 by ELETROBRAS
as a corporate entity under the Brazilian Law on Corporations. ELETROBRAS
owns 97% of ELETROSnL's shares; the remaining 3% is distributed among the
state of Rio Grande do Sul, and several Federal and State Government organi-
zations, including state-owned electric energy distributing companies of the
three states in the Southern region. As of December 1975, ELETROSUL owned
976 MW of generating capacity (570 MW hydro and 406 MW thermal, of which 80%
was coal-fired) and 3,155 circuit km of transmission lines. In 1971, the
Bank made a loan of US$70 million to ELETROSUL for the Salto Osorio Hydro-
electric Project (Loan 728-BR of April 5, 1971). ELETROSUL's performance has
been generally satisfactory.
Organization and Management
3.02      ELETROSUL is well organized and managed efficiently.  It has a six-
member Board of Directors headed by a President. The current President, a former
mayor of a major southern city with a background in civil engineering and state
and federal service, is new to the power sector. The Directors, except for one
who is named by the state of Rio Grande do Sul, are elected for two-year 1/
terms by the Annual Stockholders' Meeting. In addition to their responsibili-
ties as members of the Board, the Directors also carry out executive functions
as heads of the functional departments of the company. An organization chart
of ELETROSUL is shown in Annex 8. All the Directors have expertise in their
functional areas. They are supported by competent professional staff.
3.03      In March 1976, ELETROSUL began moving its main office in Rio de
Janeiro to Florianopolis, capital of the state of Santa Catarina, in order to
be located in the area of its operations. The move is being accomplished
efficiently. All but the engineering and construction department and the pro-
curement division are now in Florianopolis. The staff left in Rio are expected
to move to Florianopolis between December 1976 and February 1977 after phasing
out activities in Rio.
3.04      At the end of 1975, ELETROSUL had a total of 2,720 employees, 314 of
whom are professionals. To encourage its staff to move with the company to
Florianopolis, ELETROSUL, early this year, adopted an incentive plan (consist-
ing of pay increases, bonuses and home-purchase loans). In addition, it gave
preference in the hiring of new staff to qualified applicants who come from
the Southern region.
1/   A proposal to change the term of Directors to four years is expected to
be presented to the next Annual Stockholders' Meeting in early 1977.



- 12 -
Internal Control and Management Systems
3.05      ELETROSUL has a three-member fiscal council elected annually by the
Annual Stockholders' Meeting to review overall financial management. They
are not members of the company's staff. All actions taken by the President
implying financial obligations for the company must be carried out jointly
with one of the Directors. The company has an adequate accounting-information
system, similar to that employed by other electric energy bulk supply companies
in Brazil. Accounting data are processed at required regular intervals and
are adequate for management decision-making. There is an internal audit group
which carries out internal control activities on a continuing basis.
3.06      ELETROSUL has a satisfactory budgeting system which includes an
operations budget based on estimated income and expenditures, and an invest-
ment budget projecting annual outlays for ongoing projects and studies for
future projects. These are supported by several auxiliary budgets such as
external and local financing, debt servicing and cash flow budgets. Signi-
ficant deviations from cost goals are reported to the Board of Directors which
takes timely appropriate action. In reviewing the utility's construction ex-
penditures budget, the mission observed that the administration component
seemed higher than normal. In the proposed Bank project, that component amounts
to 19% of the project's direct cost. This was brought to both ELETROBRAS' and
ELETROSUL's attention. ELETROBRAS has hired a consultant to assist in prepar-
ing a system for the classification and measurement of items constituting in-
direct costs in the construction projects of its regional subsidiaries. The
recommendations are expected to be ready by April 1977. ELETROSUL agreed that
within three calendar months of the recommendations being available, it would
prepare a program with a specific timetable based on the recommendations to be
used in controlling its indirect construction costs.
External Audit
3.07      Although by Decree 72,578 the Inspector-General of the Federal Minis-
try of Finance is the official external auditor for all public entities,
ELETROSUL, in common practice with ELETROBAS and all its subsidiaries, has its
own independent external auditors. They are the firm of Boucinhas, Campos,
Coopers & Lybrand, which is qualified, has many clients in the electric energy
sector in Brazil and is associated with Coopers & Lybrand of the U.S. It has
been auditing the accounts of ELETROSUL since 1969, and has noted no exceptions
in any of those years. ELETROSUL has agreed to continue to appoint independent
auditors acceptable to the Bank and to send to the Bank its audited financial
statements together with the auditor's report within four months of the end of
each fiscal year.
Performance Indicators
3.08      Annex 18 contains a series of indicators of ELETROSUL's expected
financial and operating performance. They would be used to monitor the
utility's progress during the project period.

4. The Project
Expansion Program
4.01       ELETROSUL's expansion program during 1976-81 consists of the
following works:
A.   Ongoing Works
1. Generation
(a) the Salto Osorio hydro plant on the Iguacu River
(para 1.05); the first stage (700 MW) is expected
to be completed by December 1976; two more 175 MW
units are expected to be completed by 1980;
(b) the Salto Santiago hydro station also on the Iguacu
River (para 2.12), to come into service at the end
of 1980; and
(c) the extension of the Jorge Lacerda thermal plant,
consisting of 2 x 125 MW coal-fired units to firm
up hydro generation by 1979.
2. Transmission
(a) Salto Osorio associated transmission system - 1,016
circuit km of 230 kV lines from Salto Osorio to
Xanxere, Mourao, Foz do Areia and Curitiba and
associated substation facilities to be completed by
December 1976;
(b) Santa Catarina transmission system - 560 circuit km
of 230 kV lines and associated substations to come
into operation between 1977-78; and
(c) completion of 230 kV transmission system works related
to Passo Fundo hydro station to be completed in
December 1976.
3. Load Dispatch and Communications
(a) development of load dispatch and telecommunications
facilities.
B.   The Proposed Project (see para 4.03)



- 14 -
C.   Future Works
1.  Generation
(a) Salto Segredo hydro station (capacity 1,540 MW), also
on the Iguacu River. This plant would be needed to
meet market requirements in the mid-80's and construc-
tion is currently planned to start in 1979 (see,
however, para 2.17).
2.  Transmission
Extension of the 500 kV system to Cachoerinha and Blumenau
and second stage of Foz do Areia-Curitiba system expected
to begin in 1977-78. These works would complement the Bank
project.
D.   Minor Works
Conversion of frequency from 50 cycles to 60 cycles at the
Charqueadas power plant to be completed in 1976 and other minor
works in the 230 kV network including ELETROSUL - CESP inter-
connection as detailed in Note 14 of the Attachment to Annex 14.
4.02      The estimated construction expenditures in constant 1975 prices is
US$927 million equivalent, of which US$621 million is for ongoing works,
US$133 million for the project which is the subject of this appraisal and the
balance of US$173 million is for the works listed in para 4.01(C) and (D).
While the works other than the Bank project have not been appraised in detail,
they constitute a rational, integrated program to meet the market requirements
of the Southern region and a part of those of the Southeastern region.
ELETROSUL has made arrangements to secure the major financing required for the
program prior to 1978, except an estimated US$39.5 million (about US$54 million
in current prices) expected to be arranged from foreign private sources.
The financing plan for the 1976-81 program is discussed in Section 6 in the
context of ELETROSUL's finances and overall capital investment program.
The Project
4.03      The project proposed for Bank financing consists of two parts:
Part A (to be executed by ELETROSUL)
(a) Transmission Lines
(i)  345 circuit km of two single 500 kV lines from Salto Santiago
and Foz do Areia hydro stations converging at a switching
substation (Interligadora I) linking these lines with a
750 kV line to be constructed by FURNAS; and
(ii) 360 km of 500 kV single circuit line from Salto Santiago
station through Foz do Areia plant to Curitiba substation.



15 -
(b) Substations
(i) Four 500 kV substations (one each at Salto Santiago (switching)
Foz do Areia, Interligadora I (switching) and Curitiba) with 300
MVA installed capacity at Foz do Areia=J and 1,200 MVA at
Curitiba; plus expansion (switching) at 230 kV at Salto Santiago.
(c) Telecommunications
(i) microwave system, 600 channels;
(ii) carrier system for teleprotection and voice; and
(iii) VHF to Interligadora substation.
(d) System Operating Center
(i) An analogue and a digital computer system for data acqui-
sition, supervision and control.
Part B (to be executed by ELETROBRAS)
A sector-wide training program in Brazil and abroad during the
period 1977-79 for selected personnel in the technical, financial
and administrative areas of the sector covering a total of about
4,500 man-months (para 2.09).
500 kV - 750 kV Interconnection
4.04       The 500 kV lines comprising the interconnection component of the
project (para 4.03 (a)(i)) would be linked at the Interligadora I substation
(see Annex 9 for one-line diagram), with the 750 kV system connecting the
Itaipu project to Sao Paulo. The 750 kV system is to be constructed by
FURNAS. ELETROBRAS has arranged with FURNAS to have the segment of the
750 kV system from Interligadora I to Sao Paulo constructed three years
ahead of schedule to coincide with the completion of the 500 kV system
and related generation to permit load transfers from the South to meet the
Southeast's anticipated deficits. FURNAS will also install an additional
3,000 MVA 2/ at the Interligadora I station to enable peak transfers of up to
2,400 MW between the two regions. The design of the 750 kV system is the
result of flow studies of active and reactive power, power losses, and voltage
studies performed by ELETROBRAS. Selection of conductor size, configuration
and insulating levels and structural designs of the 750 kV lines have been
completed.
4.05      ELETROBRAS has given assurances to the Bank that the section of
the 750 kV system required to complete the interconnection of the two power
1/   1,350 MVA at 230 kV by COPEL (not part of Project).

systems would be completed simultaneously with the interconnection component
of ELETROSUL's project. The Bank would be provided with reports on progress of
the system's construction, and given access to construction work sites. An imple-
mentation schedule for the 750 kV system is shown in Annex 13. The Federal
Government agreed to guarantee the timely execution of the part of the 750 kV
svstem needed for the interconnection.
Estimated Project Costs
4.06      The project's estimated cost (in current prices during the construc-
tion period) is US$212.5 million equivalent. Project costs were estimated by
ELETROSUL's and ELETROBRAS' technical staff, and reviewed by the Bank. The
estimates of Part A of the project were based on similar construction and
equivalent data provided by ELETROBRAS and its three other regional subsi-
diaries. The estimates appear reasonable, except the administration component
of the project which appears to be on the high side. As explained in para
3.06, ELETROBRAS and ELETROSUL would take measures to control these costs,
which are in local currency and which therefore do not affect the size of the
loan. The estimates for the training program were based on the tuition costs
of institutions in Brazil and abroad offering courses in the skill areas
required for the program and on ELETROBRAS' prior experience with training
programs. The estimated foreign component of the project is US$84.0 million.
The estimate was based on analysis of the project components to determine
which items were not presently manufactured in Brazil or were likely to be awarded
to foreign suppliers or contractors.
4.07      Following is a summary of the project's estimated costs.  Details of
Part A are shown in Annex 10; details of Part B are shown in Annex 17.

4.08      The project cost estimates are based on December 1975 prices and
provision for price increases in US$ equivalents of 9% in 1976, 8% in 1977-79
and 7% in 1980-81. The estimates also make provision for physical contingency
of 6% for line equipment, 4 % for the rest of the equipment, 8% for erection
and civil works and 12% for the training program which are considered adequate.
Procurement and Disbursement
4.09      All equipment required for the project is expected to be procured
through international competitive bidding (ICB) in accordance with Bank Guide-
lines for Procurement. Equipment contracts awarded to Brazilian contractors and not
financed by the Bank would be submitted to Agencia Especial de Financiamento
Industrial (FINAME), a local financial institution which specializes in the
financing of equipment with at least 60% Brazilian added-value and which is
providing part of the project local financing requirements. Suppliers of
equipment financed by the proposed Bank loan, whose bids contain components
manufactured in Brazil equal to at least 50% of the value of the bid would
be given a margin of preference of 15% or the applicable import duties,
whichever is lower. On the basis of experience with similar projects in
Brazil, it is expected that up to 50% of the contracts would be awarded to
Brazilian suppliers.
4.10      Disbursements from the proposed Bank loan would be made against
appropriate documentation for 100% of the foreign cost of imported goods or
100% of the ex-factory cost of locally manufactureed goods required for the
project and for 100% of the foreign cost of consulting services and training.
ELETROSUL would provide ELETROBRAS with authorization to draw on the loan pro-
ceeds for up to US$4.3 million to meet the foreign cost of the training program.
The Closing Date is December 1981.
Engineering and Consulting Services
4.11      ELETROSUL contracted the services of Themag Engenharia Ltda. to
carry out the studies for the transmission system for Part A of the project.
Themag is a leading Brazilian firm with experience in high voltage trans-
mission system studies, having already carried out similar studies in 440 kV,
500 kV and 750 kV for the three other regional subsidiaries of ELETROBRAS
(FURNAS, CHESF and ELETRONORTE) and for a major company in Sao Paulo (CESP).
For engineering design, specifications and bidding documents, ELETROSUL con-
tracted the services of Montreal Engenharia S. A., which is also qualified.
ELETROSUL agreed during negotiations to continue to use the services of
consultants acceptable to the Bank to carry out the engineering required for
the project. A total of 916 engineering man-months and 1,276 man-months of
services of other technical personnel is expected to be re-
quired for Part A of the project, as detailed in Annex 11. The average base
cost (excluding travel) is estimated at US$4,820 per engineer man-month and
US$2,238 per man-month for other technical personnel.



- 19 -
4.12      Part B of the project includes 92 man-months of services for the
training of some sector engineers and the software design and development of
a national coordination center covering the South-Southeast and North-Northeast
interconnected systems. The average base cost of the services is estimated at
US$5,400 per engineer man-month.
Project Execution
4.13      The project would be executed as follows:
(a) separate bids for the main components of equipment would be called
for, as a consequence, separate contracts would be awarded for
towers, conductors, insulators, transformers, circuit breakers, etc.
The process has already started; a call for bids for towers was
issued in July 1976;
(b) the transmission route from Salto Santiago through Foz do Areia to
Curitiba is already defined -- it would be on an existing right-of-
way acquired for a 230 kV line; the final routing from Salto Santiago
and Foz do Areia to Interligadora I will be established by October
1977; all rights-of-way are expected to have been acquired by
December 1977;
(c) contractors for civil works and erection would be selected after
bidding among the firms in Brazil, which are capable and suffi-
cient in number to ensure satisfactory competition. ELETROSUL
would be responsible for dealing with the ownership of the land
and all issues related to right of way; and based on their
previous experience, no problems are envisaged;
(d) ELETROSUL would be responsible for supervision of Part A of the
project; problems arising during execution would be solved with
the assistance of consultants; and
(e) The Training and Manpower Department of ELETROBRAS would be
responsible for Part B.
A project implementation schedule for Part A of the project agreed on with
ELETROSUL and shown in Annex 12 would be used to monitor project execution.
That portion of the project is expected to be completed by June 30, 1981.
Part B of the project is expected to be completed in December 1979. A separate
implementation schedule for this part of the project is shown in Annex 17.
Environmental Aspects
4.14      Except for the final approach to Curitiba, the rest of the trans-
mission routes in the project would be in virtually unpopulated areas. Where
the transmission routes require trees tc be cut down, ELETROSUL, as in the past,
would compensate property owners following Brazilian regulations which require



- 20 -
compensation at current market prices. In cases where the property owner so
desires, ELETROSnL would provide suitable land and seedlings for reforestation
in accordance with a program approved by the Brazilian Institute of Forestry
Development (IBDF). The project cost estimates include adequate provision for
expenses related to compensation for right of way and provision for reforesta-
tion. ELETROSUL has carried out an ecological survey of the transmission line
routes and prepared an adequate program for safeguarding the related environment.

5.   Economic Justification
Introduction
5.01      The proposed project has three main objectives:
(1) to integrate the power systems of the Southern and Southeastern
regions of Brazil;
(2) to provide facilities for the first phase of extra high voltage
(EHV) grid for the Southern region; and
(3) to train selected personnel from various utilities in the sector
in technologies associated with the expanded interconnected
system, extra high voltage transmission and regional load
dispatching centers.
The integration of the two power systems (which provided 88% of the electric
energy consumed in Brazil in 1975) would enable the combined system to increase
its firm production capability by about 1,600 average MW annually beginning 1981
(see Annex 5). It would also permit deficits anticipated for the Southeastern
region for the period 1981-84 to be met from surpluses in the Southern region
during that period and reduce incremental fuel consumption by thermal plants in the
former region at a very modest cost. The facilities for the first phase of the
Southern region's EHV grid will enable incremental energy requirements in the
South, beginning 1979, to be met from the Salto Santiago and Foz do Areia plants
currently under construction. They will also improve the reliability of supply
in that region and ensure electric services to a wider spectrum of the popu-
lation. This portion of the project would complement the COPEL distribution
project financed by loan 1257-BR of May 1976 and support the Government's
strategy of diversifying the industrial base of the country to areas outside of
the Southeastern region.
5.02      The training component would provide highly specialized skills to meet
identified manpower needs arising out of the rapid growth and degree of sophis-
tication of the Brazilian power sector. Its investments amount to 9% of the
total project cost and would benefit nearly all the utilities in the sector.
Because its benefits are not quantifiable, this component was excluded from
the following analysis.
Least Cost Solution
5.03      Cost of meeting the 1981-84 anticipated deficits and reducing fuel
consumption by oil-burning thermal plants of the Southeastern region via the
interconnection (with surpluses available in the Southern region during the
period) were compared on a present worth basis with the costs of a coal-fired
thermal plant determined by ELETROBRAS as the second best solution. This
analysis (see Annex 15) shows that for interest rates below 38.3% the pro-
posed interconnection would be the more economic of the two alternatives.



- 22 -
This extremely high equalizing rate is due to the fact that generation of
the transferrable energy from the South (hydro facilities) to meet the South-
eastern deficits would not require incremental peak capacity investments.
Even if it is assumed that the investment cost of the thermal plant could be
reduced by 20% while the cost of the interconnection facilities are increased
by 20 ,, the interconnection alternative would still be lower in cost for all
interest rates below 29.5%. DNAEE, which is in charge of issuing licenses
for new electric power facilities, has given assurances to the Bank that it
will not authorize the building of any facility intended for meeting those
deficits which would affect the economic justification of the interconnection
alternative. Should additional plants have to be built because of more rapid
growth or construction delays, the Bank would be given an opportunity to
comment.
5.04      The components of the project intended for the first phase of the
Southern EHV system are part of a least-cost program to interconnect all major
hydro facilities in Southern Brazil and through its interconnection with FURNAS'
750 kV system lay the basis for an integrated national power system in Brazil,
taking into account projected load densities and existing and planned EHV sys-
tems in other parts of the country. Substation capacities have been established
to minimize the cost of investments and installation over the project's useful
life. The selection of the 500 kV voltage level for bulk transmission in the
South was based on an economic comparison with other possible voltage levels.
The routes for transmission lines would be selected to achieve minimum total
costs, subject to applicable zoning regulations.
Return on Investment
5.05      The return on the investment in the project's interconnection com-
ponent was estimated as the discount rate which equalizes the present values of
the costs of and associated with interconnection with costs and deficits penal-
ties associated with the absence of interconnection. The latter included
(i) the additional fuel costs in the Southeast (for which part of the trans-
ferrable energy would substitute) since existing thermal facilities would, in
the absence of interconnection, be operated there at full capacity to minimize
curtailments, and (ii) the value of energy and peak curtailments unavoidable
even with-maximum thermal output, (conservatively estimated to be equal to the
average final consumers' sales value less distribution costs). The return on
investment on this basis would be 29.3%. A sensitivity test assuming a slower
load growth in the Southeast during 1976-80 (para. 2.14) resulting in the
elimination of the 1982-84 deficits showed a rate of return of 23.4%. If, in
addition, it is assumed that the investment costs of the interconnection are
increased by 20X, the rate of return determined is 20.7%.
5.06      The return on investment determined for the project's Southern EHV.
component is 24.2%. Costs considered included, in addition to the investment
and operating cost of the project, the marginal generation and distribution
costs associated with the energy flowing through project facilities. The
value of the expected energy sales flowing through the facilities (based on



- 23 -
the average revenue per kWh prevailing at 1975 year-end) was used as proxy
for the benefits. Sensitivity tests increasing the cost of the EHV component
by 20% and reducing the expected energy sales by 10% resulted in a return of
20.8%.
5.07      To determine the return on Part A of the project, the costs and
benefits associated with the interconnection and Southern EHV components were
combined.  The return determined is 27%.        On the assumption that there
would be no deficits in the Southeast during 1981-85 (to take account of a
possible slower load growth in that region - see para. 2.14) the return would
decline to 24.1%. If in addition to this the project's investment cost is
assumed to increase by 20% while the expected energy sales in the South are
reduced by 10%, the return would be 22.6%.

6.   Finances
Summary
6.01      ELETROSUL's performance which had been poor (relative to other
Brazilian utilities) during 1972-74 showed considerable improvement in 1975
and is expected to be good during the construction of the Bank project (1976-
81). Return on remunerable investment is projected at 10% during the period,
and financial rates of return which averaged about 11% in the past are projected
to average 14%. The overall future outlook is satisfactory due to good manage-
ment and a reasonable national tariff policy. ELETROSUL's financial structure
is strong; its net worth at the end of 1975 represented 44% of total fixed
assets. The power sector's consumers are expected to contribute about 69% of
the financial requirements of the 1976-81 capital investment program. Annex 14
presents the utility's actual and forecast financial statements for the period
1972-82, together with notes and assumptions and details underlying the
finances which supplement the summary analysis in this section.
Past and Present Financial Performance
6.02      ELETROSUL's returns on remunerable investments during 1972-74 were
unsatisfactory: 7.3% in 1972, 5.9% in 1973, and 6.9% in 1974. These earnings
were before the introduction of the Global Guarantee Fund. As a result
ELETROSUL did not receive any transfers to reach the statutory 10% minimum
return for utilities in Brazil. The total shortfall in return on remunerable
investments - statutory minimum less actual return - over the three-year period
amounted to Cr$215.6 million at 1975 year-end. The low returns were primarily
due to the predominance of thermal plants in its generating system. In 1975,
aided by the implementation of Decree No. 73,102 allowing bulk power suppliers
to pass on to the distribution companies the cost of thermal fuel, ELETROSUL
earned a return of 9.2%, and with a modest receipt from the Global Guarantee
Fund, reached the statutory 10% minimum return.
6.03      Despite the low remunerable investment returns during the period, the
utility's financial rates of return - operating income as a percentage of aver-
age net fixed assets in operation - were satisfactory. It earned financial
returns of 10.7% in 1972, 9.7% in 1973, 11.5% in 1974 and 11.6% in 1975.
6.04      Overall, ELETROSUL's financial management has been good.  Cash
balances were kept at a minimum. Collection of accounts receivables which
had been unsatisfactory during 1974 showed improvements in 1975. Net accounts
receivables outstanding had gone from the equivalent of 74 days' billings at
1972 year-end to 106 days at 1974 year-end but were reduced to 88 days at 1975
year-end, which is comparable to those of other bulk suppliers in the Southern
and Southeastern regions of Brazil. Operating costs which represented about
77% of operating revenues in 1972 had been reduced to 52% by 1975.



25 -
Financial Position
6.05      ELETROSUL's total fixed assets almost quadruipled between 1972 year-
end and 1975 year-end, while net fixed assets in operation which amounted to
the equivalent of about US$47 million at 1972 year-end increased to the
equivalent of about US$415 million at 1975 year-end. The utility's net worth
also increased from the equivalent of about US$73 million to about US$295
million during the same period, and represented 44% of total fixed assets at
year-end 1975, an indication of the utility's fast growth and increasing
financial strength.
6.06      The utility's long term debt to equity ratio in 1972-75 stood at a
comfortable 48/52, well under the 60/40 debt limitatiorn in the Loan 728-BR
agreement.  However, ELETROSUL's debt service co'ieragc by interal cash gene-
ration during the same period was unsatisfactory because of the low returns
on remunerable investments.  The ratios were 1.( times in 1972, 0.4 times in
1973, 0.9 times in 1974 and 0.9 times in 1975..  The utility did not, however,
experience cash flow problems mainly because most of rhe due debts in the
period were owed to the parent company, ELETEOBRAS.  EIETROSUL has now reached
an understanding with ELETROBRAS to convert into equity during 1977-81 part of
the debt service payable by ELETROSUL in order to avoid future unsatisfactory
debt service ratios (para. 6.08).

/1   Excludes Part B of the p-roject (the sectorwide training program) to be
carried out by ELETROBRA.S.  The cost and financing of Part B are dis-
cussed in Annex 17.
6.08      The 1976-81 capita.l investment is the largest in the utility's seven-
year history.  It is estimat:ed to amount to about US$1.2 billion in December
1975 prices.  The financing plan to meet the requirements appeai reasonable.



- 27 -
It is based on the following assumptions: (a) conversion into equity of part
of the debt service payable to ELETROBRAS to enable ELETROSUL to maintain a
1.5 debt service coverage ratio; (b) reinvestment of ELETROBRAS' expected divi-
dends or investment by ELETROBRAS of an amount equivalent to those dividends; (c) a
projected increase in share capital (in addition to the amounts required to
implement (a) and (b)) equivalent to 28.8% of the capital investment require-
ments; and (d) that ELETROSUL would be able to secure the amounts of the pro-
posed loans.
6.09        ELETROBRAS has agreed to convert loans into equity and
reinvest dividends during 1976-81 in line with the above assumptions.
It has also agreed to provide the funds required for the financing of the
1976-81 investment program, including the proposed project.
ELETROSUL's shareholders have already approved more than 50% of the projected
capital increases; the rest is expected to be approved in due course. ELETROSUL
is expected to have no difficulty securing the proposed domestic loans; arrange-
ments for these are almost complete.  The utility, through ELETROBRAS, is also
arranging a foreign borrowing of about US$39.5 million in December 1975 prices,
or about US$54 million in current prices (3.4% of the financing requirements)
from foreign sources to meet foreign expenditures on projects complementary to
the one being financed by the Bank. A foreign financial institution has ex-
pressed its interest in considering this portion of the financing through a co-
financing arrangement with the Bank. ELETROSUL and the potential lender have
been informed that the Bank would be prepared to consider such an arrangement
at ELETROSUL's request, provided it would result in better terms for ELETROSUL
than it could otherwise obtain.
6.10      Based on these assumptions, Brazil's power sector consumers would
contribute a satisfactory 68.7% of the funds required to execute the 1976-81
capital investment program. The power consumer contribution is made up of
ELETROSnL's net internal cash generation (13%), share capital increase (28.8%),
existing ELETROBRAS loans (14.9%) and proposed ELETROBRAS loans (12%). Exist-
ing foreign loans of US$111.3 million, which include the undisbursed portion of
Loan 728-BR, US$46 million from the IDB loan for the Salto Santiago hydro
project - the largest element in the capital investment program - and bilateral
credits, would provide 9.7%. The proposed Bank loan would account for 4.8% of
the requirements. Existing domestic loans would contribute 0.1%, while planned
borrowings from domestic financial institutions would provide 13.3%.
6.11      ELETROSUL's projected financing contribution from internal cash
generation of 13% should be considered in the context of the overall financial
structure of the Brazilian power sector. About 60% of the loans provided by
ELETROBRAS would be offset by reversion payments made by ELETROSUL in the 1976-
81 period. The balance of ELETROBRAS' contribution would be more than offset
by reversion payments made by ELETROSUL's customers (the distributing utilities)
and by collections on account of the Sole Tax and the compulsory loans from
consumers in ELETROSUL's service area which will accrue to ELETROBRAS in the
period (see Annex 7).



- 28 -
6.12      As with all financial projections of Brazilian power utilities
financed by the Bank, those discussed above are based on constant (December
1975) Cruzeiros. This means that the capital investment program and finan-
cing plan (including the proposed Bank loan) are shown without price con-
tingencies. Annex 16 gives a reconciliation between the project's expendi-
tures and the Bank loan shown in paragraph 6.07 with the cost estimate
presented in paragraph 4.07 which includes price contingencies, and
paragraph 6 of Annex 14 discusses the financing of price contingencies. The
terms assumed for the Bank loan are: interest at 8.7% and maturity of 17
years including 3-1/2 years of grace. ELETROSUL would on-lend US$4.3 million
from the loan proceeds to ELETROBRAS on the same terms to meet the foreign
cost of Part B of the project.
Future Financial Outlook
6.13      ELETROSnL's future financial outlook based on the projections is
satisfactory. Return on remunerable investments during 1976-81 is projected
at 10% (without any receipts from the Global Guarantee Fund). The utility's
financial rate of return is projected to average about 14% during the period.
Its debt service coverage by internal cash generation during 1977-81 would be
no less than 1.5 times and its long-term debt to capitalization ratio is
expected to fluctuate between 48/52 to 40/60 during the 1976-81 period. To
ensure that future operations would be on a sound financial basis, ELETROSUL
has agreed: (a) not to incur debt without the Bank's consent if by such in-
currence its debt would exceed 66-2/3% of its total assets; (b) not to incur
debt with an original term of less than 8 years without the Bank's consent if
by so doing the principal of such debt would exceed 5% of its total fixed
assets; and (c) not to undertake, during the Bank project construction period,
any major generation and transmission expansion project whose cost would exceed
2% of total fixed assets without giving the Bank evidence that such expansion
is economically justified, that adequate financial resources for carrying it
out are available and that it is in accordance with the Southern and South-
eastern regions' generation and transmission development plans approved by the
Government. ELETROSUL's compliance with provisions similar to (a) and (c) in
the Loan 728-BR agreement has been satisfactory. Changes in these provisions
and the addition of (b) to the limitations are consistent with recent Bank
loans for power projects in Brazil and ELETROSUL's expanded operations.
6.14      ELETROSUL is not expected to have difficulty securing the local and
foreign resources needed for the 1976-81 capital investment program. However,
in the event that there should arise reasons to believe that there would not
be sufficient funds to assure the timely completion of the Bank project, and
the 750 kV system required for the interconnection (para. 4.05), ELETROBRAS
has agreed, and the Government has guaranteed, that resources would be made
available for the timely completion of these projects.

7.   Agreements Reached and Recommendations
7.01      During negotiations, agreement was reached with ELETROSUL on the
following principal points:
(a) ELETROSUL will maintain its earnings (inclusive of transfers
from the Global Guarantee Fund) at levels consistent with
appropriate financing and public utility practices and in
accordance with existing legislation; and that any change in
legislation which in the Bank's opinion would materially and
adversely affect ELETROSUL's financial position would be an
event of default (paras. 2.20 and 2.21);
(b) ELETROSUL will maintain its eligibility for transfers from the
Global Guarantee Fund during the project construction period
by complying with DNAEE guidelines (para. 2.20);
(c) ELETROSUL will continue to appoint independent auditors accept-
able to the Bank and continue to send its audited financial
statements together with the auditor's report within four months
of the end of each fiscal year (para. 3.07);
(d) ELETROSUL will continue to use the services of consultants
acceptable to the Bank (para. 4.12);
(e) Within three calendar months of ELETROBRAS completing action on
7.02(b) below, ELETROSUL will prepare a program with a specific
timetable for implementation (para. 3.06);
(f) that by December 31, 1977, it would have acquired all lands
and rights-of-way required for the project (para. 4.13);
(g) ELETROSUL will not incur any debt without the agreement of the
Bank if it cannot meet the debt limitation and expansion tests
(para. 6.13);
7.02      Agreement was reached with ELETROBRAS on the following principal
points:
(a) ELETROBRAS will execute the training program component of the IBRD
project (para. 2.09);
(b) By April 1977, ELETROBRAS would have classified all items con-
stituting indirect costs in ELETROSUL's construction projects
and developed standards for measuring these costs (para. 3.06);



- 30 -
(c) ELETROBRAS will convert into equity part of its long-term
receivables from ELETROSUL in amounts which will enable ELETROSUL
to achieve a debt service ratio of no less than 1.5 times during
1977-81; and reinvest its dividends from ELETROSUL or invest in
ELETROSUL an amount equivalent to those dividends during the
construction period (paras. 6.08 and 6.09);
(d) ELETROBRAS will provide the needed funds for the timely execution
of ELETROSUL's 1976-81 investment program, including the project
(paras. 6.09 and 6.14).
7.03       In addition, ELETROBRAS has given assurances that it will take all
necessary measures, including provision of funds to its subsidiary, FURNAS, to
ensure that the 750 kV system required to complete the execution of one of the
main objectives of the proposed project (the interconnection of the power
systems of the Southern and Southeastern regions) will be completed simul-
taneously with the interconnection component of ELETROSUL's 500 kV transmission
project (paras. 4.05 and 6.14).
7.04       The Government agreed to guarantee the timely provision of funds
to ELETROSUL for the execution of the Bank project as well as the execution
of ELETROBRAS' undertaking referred to in paragraphs 7.02(c) and (d), and
7.03 above (para. 6.14).
7.05       In addition, DNAEE, the Government agency responsible for granting
of licenses for new electric power facilities, has given assurances that it
will not authorize the construction of any facility that would affect the
economic justification of the interconnection component of the project; and
would provide the Bank with an opportunity to comment should additional
plants have to be built in the Southern and Southeastern regions because of
more rapid growth or construction delays.
7.06       Further, ELETROSUL and the Government have agreed to confirm
the Bank's understanding that ELETROSUL's revenues (together with transfers
from the Global Guarantee Fund, if required) should be sufficient to earn a
statutory return of 10% on its remunerable investments (para. 2.21).
7.07       With the indicated assurances, the project would constitute a suit-
able basis for a Bank loan of US$82 million for a term of 17 years including
3-1/2 years of grace.

ENERGY GAINS FROM INTERCONNECTION
1.        The South and Southeastern regions have different hydrological seasons:
precipitation in the South is from July to December, and in the Southeastern
region from December to April, which means that in the months during which
plants in the Southeast are low (resulting in reduced peak capability), the
reservoirs in the South can operate at full capacity.!/Further, analysis of
the hydrological records of the years from 1931-70 shows that the two regions
have multi-annual complementary characteristics, i.e., the critical years in
the Southeastern region have corresponded to the favorable years in the South
and vice versa.2/ The most critical years determining the firm energy output
of hydro plants in the South are based on flows of 1943-45 whereas those of the
Southeast are based on 1952-55. Simulation analyses carried out by ELETROBRAS
show that the integrated system would have a behavior similar to that of the
larger component, the Southeastern region. Thus, after interconnection, the
critical period of the combined system becomes 1952-55. Because these were
favorable years in the Southern region, the shift in the critical years would
increase the firm energy of the region's hydro plants by 1612 MW average when
both Salto Santiago and Foz do Areia stations (currently under construction)
come into operation in 1981. Following is a summary of the firm energy gain of
the hydro plants in the South resulting from the interconnection:

gain for the combined system can be expected to increase.

BRAZILs APPRAISAL OF ELETROSUL TRANSMISSION PROJECT

ELECTRICITY TARIFFS
1.       Consumers of electricity in Brazil are subject to the following
chargest
A - The basic tariffs
B - The sole tax
C - The compulsory loan
D - A social security tax
A.  The Basic Tariffs
Background
2.        Electricity charges in Brazil have been governed for over forty
years by the Water Code as amended from time to time. Regulatory powers
have been vested in the Ministry of Mines and Energy, which since 1969 has
been exercising its authority through the National Department of Water and
Electric Energy (DNAEE).
3.        Since the adoption of the Water Code in 1934&, electricity tariffs
have been based on a service-at-cost principle. Noteworthy amendments have
been: the introduction in 1941 (Decreto-Lei No. 3128) of a rate of return
on assets of up to 10%; the introduction in 1957 (Decreto No. 41019) of the
concept of a "guaranteed" rate of return on the historic asset cost; the
authorization in 1964 (Decreto No. 54938) to revalue assets to reflect price
level changes; the making in 1966 (Lei No. 5073) of such asset revaluation
mandatory; the raising in 1971 (Lei No. 5655) of the allowed rate of return
on revalued "remunerable assets" (see paragraph 12) from 10% to 12% at
DNAEE's discretion; the introduction in 1973 (Lei 5899) of the concept of
cross-subsidization; and the enactment into law in 1974 (Decreto-Lei 1383)
of the objective of tariff equalization.
4.        The guiding force in the evolution of Brazilian tariff legislation
has been recognition of the need to mobilize massive financial resources
through consumer charges to support sector growth. A noteworthy departure
was in 1959-1963--the period of rampant inflation--when tariff levels
were allowed to lag substantially behind soaring price levels, with the
result that sector expansion came to a virtual halt. With the implementation
of asset revaluation in 1964-1966, sector development gathered the momentum
which produced the impressive 10.1% average annual growth in installed capacity
over the last decade to keep abreast of growth in gross national electricity
consumption of 9.2% over the period--12.3% annually over the last five years.
5.        In 1973 the tariff authorities began implementing a government policy
intended to reduce regional inequalities and to promote, over the longer run,
a more geographically balanced economic growth. To achieve this objective,



ANNEX 7
Page 2 of 9 pages
tariffs are being set collectively within regions rather than by utility
as had been done heretofore. This collective rate setting was also
designed to induce gains in operating efficiency. When the rate unification
effort was well underway, however, Brazil was confronted with the energy
crisis and the attending generalized price inflation and tightening
of world financial markets. Rekindled domestic inflation together with
the fact that electricity tariff levels in any given year reflect asset
revaluation coefficients for the preceeding year, caused tariff increases
in 1973 and 1974 to again lag substantially behind the general price increases.
The reference price for kWh for the whole of Brazil excluding surcharges
(tarifa fiscal - see para. 14) decreased from about US3.6 cents in 1972
to US2.9 cents in 1974. The lower revenues together with rapidly increasing
operating costs brought about a liquidity squeeze, which became particularly
acute in those utilities engaged in the construction of large generation
projects characterized by long-gestation periods and which faced substantial
project cost overruns. This also caused returns on remunerable assets
for the comparatively higher cost or financially less efficient utilities
well below the 10% minimum. (As mentioned in para. 6.02 of the text,
EIETROSUL with its generating system predominantly thermal at that time, was
one of the utilities adversely affected by the tariff equalization policy).
Although tariff legislation provides that the shortfalls may be carried
forward to be offset over time against future surplus returns, the magnitude
of the shortfalls and their widespread occurrence rendered this practice
incongruent with the service-at-cost system.
6.        Sector finances were also affected since, as will be seen later,
overall sector revenues vary in direct proportion to changes in the average
price per kWh. Sector revenues decreased at the time when they were most
needed and when it became increasingly difficult to secure borrowings
on suitable terms. Overall sector revenues decreased from Cr$8.2 billion
in 1973 to Cr$7.5 billion in 1974t, both expressed in 1974 cruzeiros.
7.        Faced with (a) an expected growth in electricity consumption
at an even higher rate (13% p.a.) than in the last decade and (b) little
prospects of favorable changes in the world panorama in the foreseeable future,
and convinced that the most appropriate means of achieving an orderly, increasing
utilization of Brazil's vast hydroelectric potential is through the maintenance
of a realistic pricing policy assuring the sector an adequate supply of long-
term resources commensurate with its massive investment requirements, the
Brazilian authorities adopted the following principal measures:
i)   the granting of gradual tariff increases at higher rates than
those affecting the domestic general price level, and which
in 1975 caused the reference price per kWh to develop as follows:
Cr$ cents        US$ cents
1st Quarter                 21.0              2.71
2nd Quarter                 23.5              2.91
3rd Quarter                 28.0              3.29
hth Quarter                 30.3              3.34



ANNEX 7
Page 3 of 9 pages
ii)   the granting, beginning July 1% 1975, of discounts equivalent
to 20% for residential consumers within the 30 kWh/month
minimum consumption, and to 10% for low-tension rural consumers.
iii)   the freezing until 1983 at the 1974 level (32.5%) of the
compulsory loan (see paragraph 15) rate applicable to
industrial consumers, which was on an annually declining scale
until its elimination in 1984.
iv)   the establishment of a cross-subsidization mechanism, the
"Global Guarantee Fund", to harmonize the rate equalization
effort with the service-at-cost principle. This is accomplished
by the funding of the "Global Guarantee Fund" through a sur-
charge of up to 2% on assets in operation and using the proceeds
to supplement tariff revenues to increase the returns of qualifying
utilities earning less than the 10% minimum.
v)   the adoption by DNAEE of a number of strict measures aimed at
controlling the operating efficiency of those utilities benefitting
from the cross-subsidization mechanism, including the rationalization
of their investments and the maximization of the use of sector
revenues to meet sector expansion requirements. Utilities
falling under these measures are restricted from increasing
their operating costs, undertaking investments and expanding
their markets without DNAEE's prior approval, and their majority
governmental shareholders must maintain their service accounts
current and reinvest their dividends.
vi)   the standardization of straight line depreciation at mandatory
rates of year-end gross fixed assets of 5% (up to 5% previously)
for thermal installations and 3% (up to 3%) for hydro installation
and other equipment.
8.        In addition, ELETROBRAS is seeking that it be permitted to continue
to utilize a high proportion of the federal governmentts share of the sole
tax, which according to present legislation is to be transferred in annually
increasing proportions to other sectors through the recently created National
Development Fund (paragraph 14).
9.        This is the first time that DNAEE has set out to exercise its
controlling powers in a comprehensive manner. In preparation for this
task DNAEE has been strengthening its staff with tariff specialists drawn
mainly from the utilitiestranks.
The Present Tariff Level System
10.       The law provides that tariffs should be set at such levels as
to cover:
a)   operating, maintenance and administrative expenses;



ANNEX 7
Page 4 of 9 pages
b)   taxes other than on income (mainly property taxes);
c)   foreign exchange losses arising from the service of borrowings
in foreign exchange;
d)   straight line depreciation of estimated year-end gross fixed
assets in operation (land excluded) at the mandatory rates
already mentioned (point vi, paragraph 7);
e)   reversion (defined in paragraph 11) of between 3% and 5% of
the estimated year-end utility plant in service, less the sum
of accumulated advances, contributions and grants ("investimento
reversivel"); and
f)   a legal return ("remuneracao legal") of up to 12% but not less
than 10% of remunerable investment ("investimento remuneravel",
defined in paragraph 12), at 1DNAEE's discretion.
11.       Beginning January 1975, (Decreto-Lei 1383) reversion ("Reserva
Global de Reversao") consists oft
a)   a tax levied by the Federal Government to secure funds to
compensate private concessionaires for their assets when their
concessions revert to, or are taken over by. the Government.
This tax currently amounts to 3% of the corresponding asset
base ("investimento reversivel", defined in the paragraph 10(e)).
Its proceeds are administered by ELETROBRAS, which channel the
funds to support investments by the public concessionaires,
mostly its four regional subsidiaries; and
b)   the contributions to the Global Guarantee Fund (mentioned
in point (iv) of paragraph 7), a redistributive mechanism
made necessary by the rate equalization effort, whereby tariff
revenues are channelled from the more financially efficient
utilities to those which achieve a return (before this tansfer)
below the 10% minimum. All utilities are subject to this
contribution, which may be of up to 2% of the reversion base
at DNAEE's discretion. Monthly transfers from this fund are
only authorized to those qualifying utilities which, on a
month-to-month basis, submit evidence satisfactory to DNAEE
of their adherence to the controlling measures mentioned in
point (v) of paragraph 7.
12.      Remunerable Investment ("investimento remuneravel") is calculated
as the difference between:
a)   the sum of:
(i) the revalued gross book value of fixed assets in operation /
2/ Up to 1975, DNAEE had accepted year-end 'values, but beginning January 1976,
it has adjusted them to reflect the period of time plant added during the
year has been in operation.



AiMNEX 7
Page 5 of 9 pages
(ii) an allowance for inventory;
(iii) an allowance for other net working capital items; and
b)    i)  accumulated (revalued) depreciation and amortization j;
ii) the year-end surplus/(deficit) arising from the difference
of prior year's actual returns and the allowed legal returns;
iii) the year-end sum of advances, contributions and grants.
13.       Sector legislation provides that concessionaires should apply to
DNAEE every three years for a revision of their tariff level. Up through
1974, revisions were made annually on the basis of applications prepared
by the concessionaires using asset revaluation coefficients prepared by
Government authorities, reflecting price level changes during the preceding
year. Concessionaires were authorized to add interim surcharges to the
basic tariff approved by DNAEE to compensate for increases in wages, social
benefits, fuel costs, cost of purchased power and increases in foreign
exchange debt service arising from fluctuations in the foreign exchange
rates. Beginning in 1975, tariff level adjustments are made entirely at
DNAEE's initiative, based not on the concessionaires' actual tariff calculations
as before, but on selected cost and investment data which all concessionaires
must now submit on a monthly basis to DNAEE. In 1975 four general tariff
increases were authorized by DNAEE (January, June, September and December).
Other Charges
B.   The Sole Tax (Imosto Unico, IU)
t4.       This tax was originally imposed to provide additional financial
resources for the sector. Since 1972 (Lei 5655) this tax has been applied
to commercial and residential consumers only. The rates applicable are 60%
(commercial consumers) and 50% (residential consumers) of the "tarifa fiscal",
a country-wide reference electricity tariff calculated every three months
by DNAEE. Consumers not reaching the minimum 30 kWh/month level, rural
consumers and consumers supplied entirely by thermo-electric power, religious
institutions, federal, state and municipal government institution, and bulk
supply sold to distributing companies, are exempt for this tax. The proceeds
from this tax are distributed 40% to Federal agencies, 50% to the States and
10% to the municipalities. The funds returned to the States are prorated
among them on the basis of their area (20%), their population (60%), their
electric power generation (2%), their electricity consumption (15%) and their
total flooded areas (reservoirs) (3%). Through 1973, the funds allocated
to Federal agencies were distributed as follows: ELETROBRAS (37%),
DNAEE (2%) and Ministry of Mines and Energy - MME (1%). Beginning in 1974,
the funds allocated to the sector are on the following declining scale (%):
V  Amortization was charged instead of reversion before 1971.  Its
accumulated value as of that year, as revalued, is kept on utilities'
books and treated as a deduction from fixed assets in operation.
Reversion is not treated in this way.

1979 on                     18.0        2.0            20.0
Thus, the direct share of the sector in the portion allocated to the Federal
Government is to be reduced by 50% over a five-year period. The distribution
of the Sole Tax is calculated and administered by DNAEE every quarter. The
funds received from the Sole TLx must by law be invested by the entities
receiving them in power systems, public lighting or used in the payment of
debt service by electric concessionaires. The Federal Government uses its
share of the proceeds to purchase equity participation in power entities
in which it has to maintain a majority interest. Some of the proceeds
accruing to the National Development Fund are budgeted for the ITAIPU
bi-national project and EIETROBRAS intends to apply for further appropriations
from the fund for the sector.
C.  The Compulsory Loan (Emprestimo Compulsorio)
15.       The Compulsory Loan, a forced investment scheme also established
to supplement sector resources, like the sole tax, is based on the
"tarifa fiscal" mentioned in para. 14. It applies to industrial consumers
only and was originally on a sliding scale beginning at 35% and reducing
gradually to 10% by 1983. By Law 6180 of 1974 the rate has now been fixed
at 32.5% from 1975 to 1983 in order to sustain the level of funds available
to the electric sector. The law requires that industrial consumers take
20-year, 6% interest bearing bonds issued by ELETDOBRAS, and which are
subject to monetary correctiaa. Compulsory loan proceeds are to be
allocated by ELETROBRAS as follows:
a)  50% for investment in hydroelectric plants in the Parana
River basin, mainly ItaipA.
b)  15% for investment in hydroelectric plants in the Sao
Francisco River basin.
c)  10% for additional capital subscription in ELETRONORTE, and
d)  25% for the construction of regional transmission systems in
extra high voltage and in the development of the nuclear
power plant program.
(Previously, 50% of the funds collected from each State had to be invested
in the respective state-owned power distribution concessionaire).
D. Social Security Tax
'6.      All consumers are required to pay this tax at the rate of 1% of
their power bills (3% before June 1973).

I8.       The concessionairest average revenue (US$2.94 cents/kWh) is
comparable to that experienced in advanced industrialized countries. The
consumer contributions (US$1.20 cents/kWh or 41%) over and above the cost
of service results from the Government policy of having sector finances
rely on stable, internally generated long-term funds, rather than depend
to any sizeable extent on government budget allocations or capital market
resources. The following table summarizes the sector's (EIETROBRAS and
the concessionaires) sources and applications of funds in 1974 and in
the period 1975-79(the latter at June 1975 prices):

sulting services cost and data from ELETROBRAS on consulting services related
to other extra high voltage transmission systems in Brazil, adjusted to Decem-
ember 1975 prices. Except for some work related to the communications and
control systems which will be obtained from the U.S. and would be covered in
part by the U.S. EXIMBANK Loan, it is expected that the consulting services
for the transmission system would be carried out by qualified Brazilian con-
sultants using foreign consultants as necessary. Following are the average cost
estimates per man-month of consulting services based on the ELETROSUL and
ELETROBRAS data:
Salaries including overheads
Engineers                         US$4,820/man-month
Other Technical Personnel         US$2,238    "

3.        The total estimated cost of the consulting services required for
Part A of the project represents about 5% of the portion's total cost.
Although this appears to be considerably higher than in other projects financed
by the Bank, in view of the scope and depth of the services required by
ELETROSUL, the costs seem reasonable. The consulting services would cover,
among others:
-    the planning of the entire extra high voltage transmission system
requirements of the Southern region over a 10-year period (1976-86);
-    South-Southeast load/generation forecasts;
-    parametric studies presenting alternative solutions in terms of
costs, efficiency and reliability;
-    integration of the South-Southeast power systems;
-    detailed design, specifications and project supervision of the
transmission lines and substations in the proposed project; and
-    engineering work related to the communications and control systems.
4.        The local cost of the consulting services would be financed by loans
arranged with a local financial institution, Financiadora de Estudose Projectos
(FINEP), which specializes in the financing of engineering services and feasi-
bility studies.

FINANCES
Introduction
This Annex contains the details of ELETROSUL's finances, which
together with the following tables supplement the analysis in Section 6 of
the text:
Table 1 - Key Financial   Indicators (1972-82)
Table 2 - Statement of Actual and Estimated Income (1972-82)
Table 3 - Statement of Estimated Sources and Application of
Funds (1976-82)
Table 4 - Actual and Estimated Balance Sheet (1972-82)
Table 5 - Statement of Actual and Estimated Cost of Service
(1972-82)
Table 6 - Estimted Cosntruction Expenditures Excluding
Interest During Construction (1976-82)
Table 7 - Annual Borrowings - Long-term (1976-82)
Table 8 - New Share Capital (1976-82)
Table 9 - Schedule of Long-term Debt (1976-82)
Table 10- Interest Schedule (1976-82)
Table 11- Amortization Schedule (1976-82)
Table 12- Actual and Proposed Terms Applicable to Long-term
Debt (1976-82)
The attachment contains Notes and Assumptions underlying the financial tables.
ELETROSUL's fiscal year ends on December 31.
Projections
1.        The projections are based on December 1975 prices.  In the Balance
Sheet (Table 4), two 1975 statements are shown. The first is the actual result
of the items at year-end; the second represents the effects on those items
after the application of the 1975 revaluation coefficients.
Operating Revenue
2.        Operating revenue projections were based on the utility's tariff for
1976 approved by DNAEE. Adjustments would be made over the years to reflect
general price level increases and monetary correction; however, this has not
been taken into account in the projections. Operating expenses, detailed in
the Income Statement (Table 2), were also based on the cost of service for



ANNEX 14
Page 2 of 3 pages
1976 approved by DNAEE (in Table 5). For subsequent years, estimates are
based on installed capacity and length of transmission lines, details of
which are shown in the Notes and Assumptions.
3.        The 1976 tariff comprises a demand charge of Cr$73.00/kW per month
and an energy charge of Cr$58.20/MWh. This compares with the 1975 tariff of
Cr$59.79/kW demand charge and Cr$55.45/MWh energy charge. ELETROSUL's tariff
is comparable with those of the two main bulk suppliers in the Southeast,
FURNAS and CESP, as shown below:
Demand Charge    Energy Charge
Cr$/kW            Cr$/MWh
FURNAS                        70.97             37.40
CESP                          91.55              38.17
Assuming a 50% load factor, tariffs of ELETROSUL are approximately 11% higher
than those of FURNAS and 11% lower than those of CESP. The differentials do
not change markedly at 40% and 60% load factors. At a 60% load factor,
ELETROSUL is 13% higher than FURNAS and 9% lower than CESP.
Operating Income
4.        Operating income is based on a 10% return on remunerable investments
(see Annex 7 for composition of remunerable investments). Although the law
allows up to 12%, the 10% has been assumed because ELETROSUL, up until 1975,
has averaged only 7% return on remunerable investments. With the increasing
predominance of hydro in its generating system and the absorption of fuel con-
sumption by the distribution companies, ELETROSUL should be able to readily
earn a minimum of 10%. The utility's financial rate of return during the
period is expected to average about 14%. The financial rate is calculated on
operating income before deduction of reversion as a percentage of average net
fixed assets in operation. From a sector viewpoint, reversion is as much a
part of internal cash generation as the operating income (see para. 18 of
Annex 7).
Internal Cash Generation
5.        The increasing hydro facilities in ELETROSUL's generating system is
expected to have beneficial effect on the utility's internal cash generation.
Beginning with a projected Cr$632 million in 1976, ELETROSUL's internal cash
generation is projected to increase by slightly more than 2-1/2-fold to Cr$1.6
billion by 1981. Details are shown in the Sources and Applications projec-
tions in Table 3. Except for 1976 during which debt service coverage by inter-
nal cash generation is projected at 1.2 times, the utility's debt service
ratio is expected to be no less than 1.5 times during 1977-81, as a result of
an understanding with ELETROBRAS to reduce the latter's long-term loans re-
ceivable due within the period. After debt service, taxes and bonuses,



ANNEX 14
Page 3 of 3 pages
ELETROSUL's net internal cash generation would amount to 13% of the financial
requirements of the 1976-81 capital investment program, and would permit
ELETROSUL to, for the first time in its history, make contributions to its
investment program.
Construction Expenditures - Financing of Price Contingencies
6.        ELETROSUL's 1976-81 construction program in December 1975 prices is
estimated to cost the equivalent of US$927 million as follows:
(in December 1975 prices)
Cr$9.07 = US$1.00

1,512         166.7
Minor Works                                     62           6.8
Total 1976-81 Construction Expenditures  8,407            927.5
The estimates do not include price increases during the period. Foreign and
local loans arranged for the program include price contingencies. Shortfalls
occurring are expected to be covered by expected price level increases in
ELETROSUL's internal cash generation resulting from tariff adjustments to
reflect price increases, and funds from ELETROBRAS as stated in para. 6.14
and Section 7 of the text.

BRAZIL: APPRAISAL OF ELETROSUL TRANSMISSION PROJECT
CENTRAIS ELETRICAS DO SUL DO BRASIL S. A. (ELETROSUL)
NOTES AND ASSUMPTIONS
1.        Personnel, material and other expenses for 1976 are based on
ELETROSUL's cost of service approved by DNAEE and shown in Table I of this
attachment. For 1977-82, estimates are based on expected installed capacity
and length of transmission lines in service shown in Table I of this attach-
ment and reflect an average of about 3% of year-end assets in operation.
Estimated fuel expenses for 1976 consist solely of generation at
50 cycles in the Charqueadas and Alegrete Plants. After the conversion to
60 cycles expected to be completed in 1976, ELETROSUL itself will incur no
fuel costs in connection with thermal generation since these costs are absorbed
directly by distribution companies in the South and Southeast as determined by
Law 5,899 of July 5, 1973 and regulated by Decree 73,102 of November 7, 1973.
2.        In the years 1972, 1973 and 1974, the depreciation rates recommended
in Portaria 768 of November 11, 1968 were adopted; resulting in average rates
of 3.2%, 2.5% and 2.1% respectively of the book value of average fixed assets
in operation. In 1975 as determined by DNAEE, the maximum rates of 5% for
thermal plants and 3% for other property were adopted. These rates were used
for the 1976-82 projections.
3.        The reversion rate in 1972-74 was 3% and was increased to 3.5% in
1975 with the introduction of the Global Guarantee Fund, based on estimated
average fixed assets. A rate of 3.5% is used in the projections.
4.        As provided by law, interest is calculated at the rate of 10% per
year on equity funds applicable to work in progress (Art. 159, Par. 2 of
Decree 41,019 of February 26, 1957, amended by Decree 54,938 of November 4,
1964) .
5.        The annual appropriation for the legal reserve is 5% of net income
less provision for income tax after deduction of "miscellaneous" in the years
1972/75.
6.        Dividends are estimated to be declared at the following rates:
1976                 6%
1977                 6%
1978                 4%
1979                 6%
1980                 6%
1981                 6%
1982                 6%

7.        There is a tax of 5% on distributed dividends.
8.        Policy as to bonuses to employees is based on the estimated divi-
dends declared. A bonus of one month's pay is estimated when dividends are
declared at a rate of 6%.
1976 = 1/12 of Cr$115.3 thousand = Cr$ 9.6 thousand
1977 = 1/12 of Cr$121.5 thousand = Cr$10.1 thousand
1978 =             -               =
1979 = 1/12 of Cr$127.5 thousand = Cr$10.6 thousand
1980 = 1/12 of Cr$135.7 thousand = Cr$11.3 thousand
1981 = 1/12 of Cr$146.0 thousand = Cr$12.2 thousand
1982 = 1/12 of Cr$149.1 thousand = Cr$12.4 thousand
9.        Reserve for future capital increase is projected at 95% of the
interest on equity funds (note 4), with the remaining 5% being appropriated
for the legal reserve (note 5).
10.       The income tax rate is 6% on net income less interest charged to
construction on equity funds.
11.       The main changes in the fixed assets in operation in the 1972-75
period are indicated below in millions of Cruzeiros:

For the 1976-82 period, the projected increases in fixed assets in
operation are shown in Table IIof this attachment.
12.       Amortization is no longer provided for, although the existing re-
serve is still subject to monetary correction. The reserve for amortization
of Cr$22.0 million shown in the Cost of Service (Table 5 of the main annex)



ANNEX 14

excludes Cr$2.2 million of reversion reserve, which predates the reversion
reserve of Law 5,655 of May 20, 1971. This latter reserve is not deductible
from fixed assets in arriving at remunerable investment.
13.       The changes recorded in work in progress in the 1972-75 period are
shown below in millions of Cruzeiros:
1972      1973       1974       1975

15.       The breakdown of accounts receivable on December 31, 1975 by con-
sumers and by age is presented in Table IV of the attachment.  For the period
1972-75, the average age of accounts receivable was determined as shown below:
1972          1973          1974          1975
Accounts receivable x 365       36.2 x 365   56.6 x 365   94.0 x 365   124.1 x 365
Operating revenue              178.9         235.8          325.2         515.2 1/

For the 1976-79 period, accounts receivables have been projected on
the basis of the equivalent of two months of revenue; from 1980 to 1982, one-
and-one-half months. These estimates reflect DNAEE guidelines for reducing
overdue accounts as well as ELETROSUL's own program to tighten the system of
collection of accounts receivables.

25.9       14.3      38.8      104.4
Other recivables basically are comprised of amounts advanced for
purchases and services.  The increase in 1975 was due to coal purchased by
ELETROSUL to be charged to the GCOI (see note 1).
The special deposits in guarantee increased in 1975 because of new
legal requirements to make deposits with the Central Bank in connection with
imports.

92.9   175.3   147.3   364.3   744.9
/a   Power companies in Brazil charge interest during construction on equity
funds (see note 4). This is set up in a reserve account which is sub-
sequently transferred to share capital when the related work in progress
is transferred to fixed assets in operation. The additions to fixed
assets (see note 13) from work-in-progress includes the interest on
equity funds applied to the construction of those assets.
/b   In addition, once a year, after publication of the monetary correction co-
efficients by the Getulio Vargas Foundation, power companies revalue
their fixed assets and their long term debt and the resulting net increase
is set up in an equity reserve which is transferred to share capital at
such time as ELETROSUL's Annual Shareholders' Meeting determines. How-
ever, the portion of the monetary correction related to work in progress
has to be maintained in reserve until the termination of the respective
work, as in (a) above.
/c   The advance for capital increase is related to an agreement signed with
ELETROBRAS for the studies on the Lanca Reservoir on the Iguacu river.
In keeping with this agreement, ELETROSUL received from ELETROBRAS the
amount of Cr$3,980 thousand which in due course will be transferred to
share capital.
19.       The accounts payable related to work in progress and transferred to
other current assets (note 21) is shown below in millions of Cruzeiros:

For the 1976-79 period, accounts payable have been projected on the
basis of the equivalent of two months' operating expenses plus energy purchased;
from 1980 to 1982, one-and-one-half months were used. This is consistent with
the treatment of accounts receivable (see note 15).
20.       The dividends payable in 1972-75, represents dividends payable to
CPCAN, a federal government coal planning commission, which is now defunct.
ELETROSnL is awaiting legal clarification on the disposition of the dividends
payable to CPCAN.

balances. For the projected period, the increase in fixed assets in operation
are shown in Table II of the attachment.
24.       The criterion established by DNAEE for determining the working
capital was changed in 1975 with the introduction of Portaria 98 of Decemer 10,
1975, requiring that working capital be determined by the following formula:
CM = DNV + RCE - (ECP + CB)
where:
CM   =  working capital
DNV  -  average monthly cash, bank and cash-in-transit balances
RCP  a  monthly average of other current assets, except investments
in government bonds and similar items
ECP  =  monthly average of current liabilities except long term
debt due within one year
GB   =  year end cash and bank deposits
Applying this formula to the 1975 values, one finds:
CM = 25.4 = 294.5 - (346.8 + 35.9) = -62.8
Since the result was negative for 1975, DNAEE considered merely the
cash balance which was Cr$35.9 million, and for 1976 no value has as yet been
provided. It is expected that DNAEE will allow the year-end cash balance to
be included in determining the return on remunerable investments for 1976.
For the 1977-1982 period, working capital has been projected in the amount of
one month's billing.
25.       In 1972, 1973 and 1974, materials and supplies equalled 3% of average
fixed assets in operation. In 1975, DNAEE approved an amount equal to the
average monthly balances of that year. For 1976 the amount approved by the
DNAEE was used and for 1977-1982, 1.5% of average fixed assets in operation was
adopted. The basis for this estimate is reasonable and it is expected to re-
flect ELETROSUn's requirements.

26.       The decline of Cr$18 million in 1974 reflects a change from contri-
butions in aid of construction made by the Federal Electrification Fund which
was changed to long-term debt in accordance with Law 4,676 of June 16, 1965.
27.       As provided by law, past shortfalls in return on remunerable invest-
ments below the statutory minimum of 10% are to be maintained in "Return
Account for Future Readjustment in the Remunerable Assets" to be offset by
future excess returns at the discretion of DNAEE. Total shortfall to date
amounts to Cr$215.6 million.
28.       The actual operating revenue for the years 1973/75 broken down by
customers was as follows:
Cr$ millions
Companies supplied                 1972       1973       1974       1975

178.9     234.6      325.1      501.2
29.        1976 power purchases from CESP are projected as follows:
Demand:        160,000 kW  x Cr$75.00  =  Cr$12.0 million
Consumption:   57,696 MWh x Cr$37.40  =  Cr$ 2.2 million
Cr$14.2 million
The tariffs used in this projection are those established by DNAEE's
Portaria 100 of December 18, 1975 for use in 1976.
30.       The depreciation and amortization balance is shown in Table V of the
attachment.
31.       ELETROBRAS' total dividends during 1976-82 would be invested.  There-
fore, the net dividend shown in the Sources and Application Statement corres-
ponds to the dividends paid other shareholders plus the tax on the total divi-
dends, as can be seen in the table below:

32.       Other payments are shown as follows:
-  Accounts payable (short-term loans):                      54.9
- Services for the jobs performed in 1975
but not included in accounts payable:                 117.6
-  Accounts payable - work in progress:                     100.0
272.5
These payments result in a reduction of the Cr$325.2 million "Other Current
Liabilities" shown in Note 21; thus an amount of Cr$272.5 million is shown as
other payments drawn on 1976 resources (see Sources and Application Statement -
Table 3) with the balance of Cr$52.7 million shown in the Projected Balance
Sheet (Table 4).
33.        ELETROBRAS has agreed to convert into equity part of its loans receivable
from ELETROSUL's in order to enable ELETROSUL to reach a minimum debt service cover-
age by internal cash generation of 1.5 times during 1977-81. Following is a projection
of the debt service coverage, taking into account the conversion of ELETROBRAS loans

ANNEX 15

BRAZIL: APPRAISAL OF ELETROSUL TRANSMISSION PROJECT
CENTRAIS ELETRICAS DO SUL DO BRASIL S. A. (ELETROSUL)
Economic Justification
Introduction
1.        The project consists of 500 kV transmission facilities to inter-
connect the power systems of the South and Southeastern regions of Brazil,
similar facilities to provide the first phase of the Southern region's
extra high voltage (EHV) grid, and about 4,500 man-months of training for
selected personnel at all levels of technical, administrative and financial
areas of the electric power sector. The integration of the power systems
of the Southern and Southeastern regions would improve the firm energy pro-
duction capability of the integrated system by about 1,600 average MW begin-
ning in 1981 because of the complementary hydrological characteristics of
the two regions (see Annex 5). The integrated systems would further enable
transfers of energy between the two regions, beginning with transfers from
the Southern region to meet anticipated deficits in the Southeastern region
during 1981-84 pending commissioning of the Itaipu hydroelectric project
(para. 2.16 of the text). The Southern EHV grid would improve the relia-
bility of energy supply in that region, and enable incremental energy re-
quirements of the South, beginning in 1979, to be met from the Salto Santiago
and Foz do Areia hydro plants currently under construction (para. 2.12 of the
text), thus complementing the COPEL Distribution Project financed by Loan
1257-BR. The training program would meet identified high-level skill needs
arising from the rapid growth and degree of sophistication of the Brazilian
power sector.
2.        Because of the complexity of the project in relation to the electric
power requirements of the two regions, four separate analyses were made to
assess the economic justification of the proposed project:
(a) Paras. 6 through 10 and Table 3 - a least-cost analysis shows
that it is much less costly to meet the anticipated 1981-84
deficits of the Southeastern region via the interconnection
rather than with the alternative - which would be the second
best - of constructing a coal-fired thermal plant;
(b) Para. 12 and Table 4 - a second analysis on the interconnection
component of the project determines that this component is amply
justified as its cost - together with relevant upstream and down-
stream costs - are far inferior to the associated benefits of
(i) meeting the 1981-84 deficits and (ii) reducing fuel costs in
the Southeastern region during the period;
(c) Paras. 11 and 14 and Table 5 - A least-cost and cost-benefit
analyses of the Southern EHV component of the project show that
this component is also justified;
(d) Para. 14 and Table 6 - a rate of return analysis for the overall
proposed project shows that it is amply justified.



ANNEX 15
Page 2 of 6 pages
3.        Assumptions and notes used for the economic justification are
presented in the Notes and Assumptions attached to this annex.
Load Forecast
4.        The load forecast for the Southern and Southeastern regions prepared
by ELETROBRAS (Annex 2) for the period 1976-87 appears reasonable, although
the appraisal mission considered the 1976-80 load forecast for the South-
eastern region to be high. ELETROBRAS' projection foresees an average of
12.2% annual growth for the Southern region and 9.6% for the Southeastern re-
gion during the period. Actual growth in the past 5 years has been 15.2% for
the South and 11.2% for the Southeast. However, in view of the recent lower
Brazilian GNP growth, the mission considered 8.8% annual growth in 1976 and
gradually increasing to 10% by 1980 to be more reasonable for the more
industrialized Southeastern region. The alternative lower growth rate for the
Southeast during 1976-80 results in approximately 1 year's delay in that region's
load growth during 1980-84. This has been taken into account in the rate of
return analysis.
5.        During the period 1981-84, the Southeastern region is expected to
face deficits (in a critical hydrological period - see Annex 6) of:
-----------------MW average-------------
1981           1982          1983           1984
426           1162          1651           1014
based on the assumption that three units of the Itaipu hydroelectric project would
be coming into service in 1984 (para. 2.16 of the text). A dynamic simulation of
the Southeastern system performed by ELETROBRAS indicated that in an average
year by operating the available thermal facilities in that region at their maxi-
mum technically-feasible operating capabilities, the deficits would be reduced to:
-----------------MW average-------
1981           1982          1983           1984
305           794            157
which would be metll from surplus energy that would be available to ELETROSUL in
the South through the interconnection component of the proposed project. The
results of the ELETROBRAS simulation are summarized in Table 2 of this annex.
Interconnection - Least-Cost Solution
6.        This analysis was made to determine the least-cost solution to
meeting the anticipated 1981-84 deficits and reducing the incremental fuel
consumption by oil-burning thermal plants in the Southeastern region during
1981-85. The comparison is between the interconnection component of the project
and its related costs and a coal-fired thermal plant to be located in Sao Paulo
(which a major utility in the Southeastern region has expressed interest in
building) selected by ELETROBRAS through a cost-benefit analysis as being the
second best solution to meeting those deficits.
1/ Except for a small shortfall in 1983.



ANNEX 15
Page 3 of 6 pages
7.        The following assumptions were made in the anslysis:
(a)  Because of the increase in the generation capability of hydro plants
in the Southern region resulting from the interconnection (Annex 5),
it was assumed in the anslysis that no incremental generation invest-
ment costs would be required for the energy to be transferred to the
Southeast from the South although operations and maintenance costs
for the generation of the transferrable energy would be charged. It
was further assumed that the required distribution facilities would
be common to any of the alternatives.
(b)  After 1985 (when Itaipu is expected to have been commissioned) the
interconnection facility is expected to serve primarily to transfer
emergency energy between the two regions. It would provide the
equivalent of about 1,612 average MW of standby capacity, compared
to the thermal facility which would provide only 794 average MW of
capacity. Assuming that the economic values of providing the 794
average MW after 1985 via each alternative are equal, the inter-
connection is credited with an amount equivalent to the least-cost
alternative means of providing emergency energy to the Southeast
after 1985, over and above the 794 average MW provided by the thermal
alternative,i.e.818 (1612-794) avcrage MW equivalent capacity.
8.        The costs related to the interconnection facilities are (i) the
interconnection component of the project, (ii) the cost of advancing by 3
years the 750 kV system from Interligadora I to Tijuco Preto (Sao Paulo)
which is required to complete the interconnection, (iii) the operations
and maintenance costs associated with these facilities and (iv) the operations
and maintenance cost associated with the generation of transferrable energy.
These costs are offset by the value of the 1981-85 oil savings resulting from
the use of part of the transferrable energy to substitute for oil-burning
generation in the Southeast and the economic value in 1986 of the 818 average
MW equivalent capacity of the interconnection facility over the thermal
alternative (valued at the cost of an equivalent gas turbine generating
capacity). Following are the costs related to the interconnection alternative

9.        The costs associated with meeting the 1981-84 deficits via the
thermal alternative are the investment cost of the coal-fired thermal plant
and its fuel, operating and maintenance costs and additional fuel cost in
1984 to substitute for 232 MW average of oil-burning energy; these costs
are offset by the oil savings resulting from the substitution of equivalent
amount of the thermal alternative's energy for 232 MW average of oil-burning
energy in 1984.

10.       A summary of the two cost streams is presented in Table 3. On the
basis of this analysis it has been determined that for interest rates below
38.3% meeting those deficits (and reducing incremental oil consumption by
Southeastern oil-fired plants during 1981-85) via the interconnection would
be the more economic of the two alternatives. Discounted at 14% opportunity
cost of capital over the 12-year period, the present worth of the savings
that would result from adopting the interconnection alternative would be about
US$221 million; at 18% it would be worth US$153 million. If the investment
cost of the thermal alternative were reduced by 20% and the investment cost
of the interconnection (the project's interconnection and the cost of advancing
the 750 kV system) is increased by 20%, the interconnection would still be the
least-cost solution for those deficits for interest rates below 29.5%.
Southern EHV Grid- Least-Cost Analysis
11.       The Southern EHV component in the project is part of a least-cost
program to interconnect all major hydro facilities in the South and through
its interconnection with FURNAS' 750 kV system integrate the South and South-
eastern regions' power systems and lay the basis for an integrated national
power system for Brazil. The selection of the 500 kV voltage for the South
took into account the projected load densities and existing and planned EHV
systems in Brazil; and was based on economic comparison with other possible
voltage levels. The routes for these lines would be selected to achieve
minimum total costs; and substation capacities have been established to minimize
the cost of investments and installation over the project's life.

Cost-Benefit Analysis of the Interconnection Component of the Project
12.       Having determined the interconnection alternative as the least-cost
solution for meeting the Southeast's 1981-84 deficits, an analysis was made
comparing the costs of and associated with interconnection with its benefits,
measured by the costs and deficit penalties associated with the absence of
interconnection. The cost of interconnection are: (i) the investment cost
of the project's interconnection component; (ii) the cost of advancing by
3 years the portion of Itaipu's 750 kV system needed to complete the inter-
connection; (iii) the operations and maintenance costs of these facilities;
(iv) the operations and maintenance costs for generating the transferable
energy; and (v) the economic value in 1986 of the total 1,612 MW average
interconnection energy gain valued at the cost of an equivalent gas turbine
generating capacity. The quantifiable benefits of the interconnection are:
(i) the avoided additional fuel costs (oil savings) in the Southeast since
the existing thermal facilities there would, in the absence of interconnection,
be operated at full capacity to minimize curtailments, and (ii) the value of
energy and peak curtailments unavoidable even with maximum thermal output
(conservatively estimated to correspond to the value of that energy at the
average final consumer level less distribution costs). These benefits are
detailed in items E and F of the attachment and summarized (together with
the costs) in Table 4. The rate of return determined on the investment in
the interconnection component of the project is 29.3%. The present worth
of the net benefits discounted at 14% is about US$211 million equivalent;
at 18% it is estimated to amount to about US$127 million. About half of
these benefits are derived from the expected oil savings during the period.
A sensitivity test assuming a slower load growth in the Southeast during
1976-80 (para. 2.14 of the text) resulting in the elimination of the 1982-84
deficits showed a rate of return of 23.4%. If, in addition, it is assumed
that the investment cost of the interconnection (and the cost of advancing
the 750 kV system) are increased by 20% the rate of return determined is 20.7%.
Southern EHV Component - Cost-Benefit Analysis
13.       Economic costs considered for this analysis are: (i) the Southern
EHV component's costs, (ii) the marginal generation and distribution costs
associated with the energy expected to flow through the Southern EHV facilities
included in the project (based on the investment costs of Salto Santiago and
Foz do Areia hydro plants and of the required additions to distribution capacity)
and (iii) the operations and maintenance costs associated with these facilities.
Benefits considered are the value of the energy flowing through the project's
facilities based on the average economic unit benefit per kWh prevailing at
year-end 1975. These costs and benefits are detailed in items A and F of the
Notes and Assumptions and summarized in Table 4. The rate of return on this
component is 24.2%. If the investment cost of the Southern EHV component
were to increase by 20% while the expected energy sales declined by 10%, the
rate of return would be 20.8% suggesting that the current level of tariff in
the South is higher than the estimated costs associated with the expected
incremental energy.

Rate of Return - Part A of the Project
14.        For the return on the investment in the portion of the project
to be executed by ELETROSUL (Interconnection and EHV components), the costs
and benefits considered are those associated with transferable energy to
the Southeast and those associated with the energv flowing through the Southern EHV
system. These are summarized in Table 6. The return on investment determined
is 27%. If a slower load growth in the Southeast during 1976-80 resulting in the
elimination Of the deficits in the Southeast during 1982-84 is assumed, the rate
of return is 24.1%. If, in addition to this, the project's cost and the cost
of advancing the 750 kV system by 3 years are assumed to increase by 20% while
the expected incremental energy sales in the South is decreased by 10%, the
rate of return is 22.6%. The present worth of the net benefits on the invest-
ments in this portion of the project discounted at 14% over the project's
useful life is about US$535 million; at 18% it is about US$248 million.

NOTES AND ASSUMPTIONS TO ECONOMIC JUSTIFICATION
I. Assumptions
The following assumptions have been made in the assessment of
the economic benefits of the project:
(i)   All costs and benefits data are based on December 1975 prices;
(ii)   the local cost component (about 60% of costs, excluding the training
program component) ana benefits denominated in local currency were
adjusted downward by a factor of 22%    to reflect the shadow exchange
rate of the Brazilian Cruzeiro;
(iii)   costs are exclusive of taxes and duties;
(iv)   marginal hydro generation capacity costs associated with the
project are based on the kW investment costs of Foz do Areia
and Salto Santiago hydro plants currently under construction
in the Southern region
(v)   marginal distribution investment costs were assumed to be
US$280.00/kW - which is comparable to the current average
incremental investment costs for such facilities in the two
regions;
(vi)   thermal generation capacity and fuel costs are based on data
from ELETROBRAS:
(a) capacity costs for coal-fired thermal plant - US$300/kWl./
(b)  fuel - coal:  US$ mills 5.0/kWh_/
oil:  US$17.76/MWh (or US$11.66/bbl.)
(vii)   Operations and maintenance costs and economic lives of facilities
are based on the experience of utilities in the Southern and
Southeastern regions of Brazil:
hydro generation          -       1% (50-year life)
thermal generation        -       5% (35-year life)
transmission              -       2.5% (35-year life)
distribution              -       5% (35-year life)
1/ June 1975 prices: Unit cost of US$331.46/kW, adjusted to Dec.75 prices by an
increase of 3.5% = US$343.06 less shadow price adjustment (.22 x .60 x US$343.06)
US$297.71/kW. US$300.00/kW was assumed for the analysis. Excludes interest during
construction and price contingencies.
2/ Based on fuel cost data of June prices adjusted to December and shadow-priced.



ANNEX 15
Attachment
Page 2 of 9 pages
(viii) benefits, inclusive of taxes, are based on the average final
consumer tariff of COPEL 1/ (Southern Brazil):
Average price of energy at market price (Cr$/kWh)   0.371
Sole tax at market price (Cr4/kWh)                     0.055
Total tariff at December 1975 prices                   0.426
Less shadow price (.22 x 0.426)                       ( .093)
Economic unit benefit (Cr$/kWh)                        0.333
Economic unit benefit (US$/kWh)                         .037 2/
(ix) because the benefits of the training program component are not
quantifiable that component is excluded from the analysis.
II. Notes
The following notes show how the above assumptions affect the cost
and benefits used in the analyses.

ANNEX 17
Page 1 of 3 pages
BRAZIL - APPRAISAL OF ELETROSUL TRANSMISSION PROJECT
CENTRAIS ELETRICAS DO SUL DO BRASIL S. A. (ELETROSUL)
ELETROBRAS TRAINING PROGRAM
Introduction
1.        During calendar year 1976, the sum of Cr$111.84 million (US$12.3
million) will be invested in training by the power sector. This sum will be
shared between ELETROBRAS and the utilities as follows:
Number of personnel to be trained   -  41,000
Estimated expenditure by the utilities         -          Cr$ 86.0 million
Estimated expenditure by ELETROBRAS            -          Cr$ 25.84 million
Total investment in training by the sector   -            Cr$111.84 million
2.        This training will be carried out in the 27 regional training centers
operated by the various utilities throughout the country (see Attachment I of
this annex), and in selected universities. (Attachment I shows the geographi-
cal distribution of the training centers). Taking into consideration the
special manpower requirements of the Northern and Northeastern regions, 49%
of the courses initiated by ELETROBRAS will be concentrated in training centers
in those regions.
3.        In spite of these continuing efforts at manpower development aimed
at all levels of technical, financial and administrative staff, ELETROBRAS
has identified the need to introduce additional advanced level programs arising
from the rapid growth of and degree of sophistication reached by Brazil's
electric power system, in particular, the planned expansion of the intercon-
nected system, the increased use of extra high voltage transmission, and the
establishment of both a National Control Center and regional Dispatch Centers
all require additional high level training for selected staff.
The Training Needs
4.        These have been identified in the following specialist fields, and
are justified in both the short term (during the next five years) and, beyond
that, into the 1980's.  Programs are required, at an advanced level in:
a)   system planning and operation;
b)   system control;
c)   transmission and distribution;
d)   utility economics and financial administration;
e)   standardization and quality control;
f)   systems engineering;



ANNEX 17
Page 2 of 3 pages
g)   thermal and hydro plant design;
h)   work-safety and industrial medicine;  and
i)   financial management, credit generation on and procedures of
money markets.
5.        ELETROBRAS is therefore proposing, over the three-year period 1977-
79, to train selected staff from all the utility companies in Brazil, together
with professors from selected universities, through a combination of short
courses overseas, attachment to appropriate utility companies in the United
States, Canada and Europe, and seminars conducted in Brazil by qualified
practitioners from abroad specializing in all the above fields.
6.        The inclusion of professors from engineering schools in Brazilian
universities is an innovative means of ensuring that, by setting up the
required advanced-level courses in their own schools on their return, the
universities will be able to meet the training needs of the power sector into
the foreseeable future. The total foreign cost of these programs is esti-
mated to be $4.3 million, while the local costs, which will be met by ELETRO-
BRAS, amount to the equivalent of $11.1 million. Details of the cost breakdown
are shown in Attachment 2.
Technical Assistance
7.        In addition to the above programs, technical assistance would be
provided through consultants services to ELETROBRAS for the purpose of set-
ting up a National Supervision and Co-ordination Center to rationalize, at
a country level, the use of generating and transmission facilities. This
national center would complement the work of the Co-ordinating Groups for
Interconnected Operation (GCOI), already fully operated in the case of the
Southern and Southeastern regions and being set up in the Northeastern region
of Brazil. The GCOI's are responsible for the rationalization of generation
and transmission installations so as to:
a)   ensure continuity of power supply by the most economical and
efficient means, and
b)   guaranteeing economy of fuel consumption in auxiliary thermal
plant backing up the base-load hydro and nuclear plants.
To this end, maximum use must be made of interconnections, requiring complete,
continuous and reliable reports on the system, and involving highly trained
personnel, supervisory and processing installations (dispatch centers), proper
communications, etc. The National Co-ordination Center will be set up with the
aid of consultants, will enable future inclusion of the Northern and North-
eastern regions in the national interconnected system, from which ELETROBRAS
expects to derive substantial economic benefit.
8.        The technical assistance is included in the training component,
although it could be considered as a transfer of technology. Even though
not in a didactically structured form, however, the training of Brazilian
engineers by consultants engaged in the project, justifies its inclusion with
other more formal training programs. An amount of US$500,000 has been esti-
mated for this purpose, which includes, in addition to training, design work
and software development. The consultants, are expected to provide 92 man-
months of service (at an average of about US$5400/month) of which about 50%



ANNEX 17
Page 3 of 3 pages
will be devoted to training.
9.        In order to operate and co-ordinate the selection of trainees and
professors attending the various programs overseas, as well as to arrange
for seminars in Brazil by visiting specialists, ELETROBRAS will call on the
services of its Training and Manpower Development Department, an efficiently
run organization staffed by 47 persons including more than 30 graduates.
However, to handle the logistic arrangements abroad for selecting courses,
arranging for attachments of trainees to utilities, and for generally monitor-
ing the complex program over the three-year period, ELETROBRAS will rely on its
consultant Lynch, Wilde & Co. (U.S.).        The foreign costs of this service,
which is necessary to ensure the success of the program, is also included in
the total estimated cost of the training component.
