MEMORANDUM AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT
OF THE INTERNATIONAL BANK FOR RECONSTRUCTION AND DEVELOPMENT
TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS
ON A PROPOSED LOAN
TO THE REPUBLIC OF THE PHILIPPINES
FOR AN EARTHOUAKE RECONSTRUCTION PROJECT
1.          The following memorandum and recommendation on a proposed loan to
the Republic of the Philippines for US$125 million equivalent is submitted for
approval in support of the Government's earthquake reconstruction efforts. The
proposed loan would have a term of 20 years, including five years of grace, at
the standard variable interest rate.
2.          Bacg]round.  The earthquake experienced by the Philippines on July
16, 1990 was one of the strongest and most destructive to occur in the country
during the last 40 years. The tremor had a magnitude of 7.7 on the Richter scale
and affected an area of about 100,000 kmZ on the island of Luzon.   The
earthquake's epicenter was located near the city of Cabanatuan, about 60 miles
north of Manila. Since July 16, about 130 aftershocks have occurred, at least
15 of which have had magnitudes of 5.0 or more on the Richter scale. The most
serious damage occurred over an area of about 15,000 km2, affecting the cities
of Baguio, Dagupan, and Cabanatuan and the towns of Agoo, Aringay, Caba and Sto.
Tomas, which received severe damage to their municipal buildings, markets,
schools and housing. Overall, at least 1,700 people have died, 700 are still
missing, 3,500 were injured, and more than 24,000 houses were destroyed. The
damage to homes and public infrastructure (mainly roads, bridges, ports, schools,
hospitals, and government buildings) totals an estimated P 15 billion (US$600
million equivalent).   The earthquake's total damage to agriculture, private
buildings, mining and tourism, is still being assessed by the Government.
3.          To cope with the disaster, the Government has formulated a three-
stage program. The first stage, rescue and relief operations, under the National
Disaster Coordinating Committee, focused on the immediate actions needed to help
the people affected and lasted for about two weeks.   The second stage,
rehabilitation and recovery, is under the direction of the Presidential Task
Force on Rehabilitation and is focused on rapidly executed projects to put vital
infrastructure back into service. The second stage started on July 25 with an
expected duration of one year. The third stage, reconstruction and development,
comprises the longer-term restoration effort, with about 50 days of planning and
three to five years of execution.   The National Economic and Development
Authority (NEDA) in cooperation with other government agencies is responsible
for this third task.
4.          The overall Reconstruction Program for public infrastructure and
housing would cost an estimated US$600 million, for which the Government will
need about US$500 million in external financing. It is currently seeking this
assistance from various external donors and multilateral  sources.    Many
governments and multi-lateral donors have expressed a willingness to assist the
Government of the Philippines (GOP) in financing its Reconstruction Program.
The United States Agency for International Development (USAID) which has agreed
to provide about US$20 million to finance the reconstru.tion of schools, public



- 2 -
markets and local roads.   The Asian Development Bank (ADB) is expected to
complete its appraisal of a US$100.0 million loan on concessional terms in late
September 1990.   The Government of Japan has been requested to provide a US$
300.0 million commodity loan and will respond after the GOP has completed the
damage assessment and financing plan.   The proposed Bank loan will provide 25%
of the external financing required, and when combined with the reallocation of
about US$79 million of uncommitted funds from existing loans, will provide the
Government with about 34% of the estimated cost of the Reconstruction Program.
5.          Bank Approach  and  Project  Preparation.    In  response  to  the
Government's request for assistance in reconstructing infrastructure damaged by
the earthquake, the Bank's strategy was to begin immediately preparing a possible
emergency reconstruction loan while at the same time identifying uncommitted
funds from existing loans that could be reallocated to provide immediate
financial assistance to the area. The Bank's initial damage assessment mission,
comprising the Resident Representative in Manila, a highway engineer, and a port
consultant, was dispatched one day after the earthquake, on July 17, to assess
the situation and gather information for a possible reconstruction loan. This
assessment mission was followed by a mission, beginning August 9, 1990, which
identified and appraised the proposed project. Negotiations for the loan were
conducted in Manila from September 12 - 14, 1990. During the appraisal, the
Government indicated that the uncommitted balances in the loan accounts of six
existing Bank loans would be utilized to address the needs of education,
municipal development, port facilities, energy, irrigation, and housing.
6.          Project Objectives and Rationale for Bank Involvement. The objective
of the proposed multisectoral project would be to minimize the adverse economic
impact of the disaster by assisting in the reconstruction of essential
infrastructure and other facilities to promptly restore economic activity in
the affected area. In addition, the project will introduce measures to lessen
the impact of future earthquakes. The project will cover sectors in which the
Bank has previous experience and current loans. and therefore a comparative
advantage in quickly identifying needed repairs, coordinating new work with
ongoing contracts, and ensuring that reconstruction plans are compatible with
the overall policy framework in each sector. Bank involvement will also bring
international experience to bear on the development of Reconstruction Proposals
(RPs) for the affected area and to prevent the recurrence of similar earthquake
damage in the future by strengthening existing building codes and/or their
enforcement. Land use controls (height and building bulk limitations) will also
be improved with special restrictions and penalties for high-risk zones, e.g.,
flood plains and unstable subsoils/geology.
7.          Project  Descrigtion.       The  proposed  project  will  finance
reconstruction activities over a three and one half year period, including: (a)
reconstruction investments in key infrastructure and housing (accounting for
79% of total base costs); (b) financing of critical construction materials and
commodities needed to implement the project (16% of base costs); and (c)
technical assistance for both project execution and the implementation of
measures to mitigate earthquake damage in the future, including the provision
of training in geology and seismology and the procurement of equipment for
seismological studies (5% of base costs).



8.          The reconstruction investments would be focused on four subsectors:
(a) roads and bridges - to reconstruct and rehabilitate a portion of the national
highway system destroyed or badly damaged by the earthquake and landslides which
followed, and a portion of the local roads and bridges connecting towns and
villages to the highway system; (b) housing - to reconstruct or repair homes
destroyed or damaged in seven urban areas through the on-lending of project funds
by the National Home Mortgage Finance Corporation (NHKFC) for housing credit
programs carried out by the National Housing Authority (NHA) and private housing
entities; (c) medical facilities - to reconstruct and re-equip damaged hospitals
and clinics; and (d) irrigation - to reconstruct damaged irrigation systems.
Project technical assistance would prepare detailed designs and procurement
documents and supervise contracts for project components. It would also: (a)
help develop Reconstruction Proposals for the affected areas; (b) recommend
revisions to the local building codes where needed; (c) improve the level of
technical expertise in earthquake-resistant construction, in both the
construction industry and the public sector via training to enhance the quality
and resilience of national infrastructure and private buildings; and (d) re-
establish a network of seismic monitoring instruments throughout the country.
9.          Estimated Costs and Financing Plan.  The total cost of the proposed
project, including taxes and contingencies, is estimated at US$182.7 million
equivalent, with a foreign exchange component of US$106 million or 58%. The
proposed Bank loan of US$125 million would finance about 70% of total project
costs. A summary of project costs and financing is presented in Schedule A.
Due to the emergency nature of the project, US$25.0 million will be provided
under retroactive financing for the removal of debris, opening of roads and
bridges, temporary hospitals and medical facilities, and the acquisition of
essential construction materials.   Amounts and methods of procurement, the
proportion of expenditures to be financed and the disbursement schedule are
shown in Schedule B. A timetable of key project processing events and the status
of Bank Group operations in the Philippines are given in Schedules C and D,
respectively. Maps (IBRD 22617, 22618 and 22619) are also attached.
10.        Ilmlementation.   To expedite execution,  the project would be
implemented within the Government's existing organizational framework and would
rely on the line agencies' technical expertise to monitor and supervise the
implementation of their respective project components.    A  small Project
Coordinating Unit (PCU) has been created under the jurisdiction of the Department
of Public Works and Highways (DPWH) to monitor and coordinate the project. This
unit would be supplemented by geo-technical consultants to advise the
implementing agencies on site location and design issues. Responsibility for
actual project implementation, to inclu'de all procurement, contracting and
submission of disbursement applications to the Bank, would be with the Project
Implementation Units (PIUs) established in each of the line agencies for the
implementation of the project. These agencies and departments are familiar with
the Bank's policies and procurement procedures. A Steering Committee would be
established in each of the affected regions to advise the PCU on procedures to
facilitate project implementation. The Steering Committees would meet with the
PCU on a quarterly basis for a formal review of the project. The PCU will submit
quarterly and annual progress reports to the Bank, the Government's Project
Facilitation Committee and to the Steering Committees.   No problems are



- 4 -
envisioned with project start-up since the first year's works are ready for
immediate implementation. The implementing agencies have allocated available
staff to the PIUs and will select consultants, where needed, to assist in the
preparation of the detailed designs for the various project components. The
completed designs will be reviewed by the geo-technical consultants working with
the PCU and the PIUs prior to their submission to the Bank for review. A portion
of the counterpart funds for the first year of project implementation have
already .-en released.  The remainder of the counterpart funds will be released
throughout the year.
11.         Actions Agreed.  The Government has agreed to:  (a) include the
expenditures required to implement the project in its annual. budget proposals
for the project years, with adequate arrangements for the flow of counterpart
funds; (b) implement the project in accordance with technical, financial, and
environmental standards and procedures acceptable to the Bank; (c) prepare
Reconstruction Proposals (RPs) for each jurisdiction in the affected area by
March 31, 1991 and submit the RPs for review and comment by a technical panel,
established by the Government in consultation with the Bank; (d) maintain
adequate qualified staff in each of the PIUs and the PCU and provide the
necessary facilities to ensure qualitative and timely implementation and
supervision of the proposed project; (e) require the various implementing
agencies to employ both local and foreign consultants, where needed, to serve
as technical and project advisors to ensure rapid project implementation in
accordance with appropriate geo-technical standards; and (f) on-lend a portion
of the proceeds of the loan for the housing component under terms and conditions
satisfactory to the Bank.
12.         Benefits and Risks.  The project would provide the Government with
the financial and technical assistance needed to promptly reconstruct key
infrastructure in the area most seriously damaged by the earthquake. The only
significant risk is that the economic condition of the country may deteriorate,
resulting in budgetary pressures to reduce the rate of project implementation
and possibly 4.apede enforcement of improved standards for future construction
of tho nat.ln's infrastructure and housing. Accordingly, the project provides
technical assistance to support project implementation, enhance the training of
professional staff and strengthen the existing building codes which have been
found to be inadequate. Another project risk is the possibility of delays which
could result from a potential loss of momentum normally experienced in
reconstruction activities, and from inadequate personnel to implement all of the
projects. To address these risks, the project will consist of short-term, well-
focused components and will provide needed materials and implementation support.
Frequent supervision missions are planned during the first two years of the
three-year implementation period so that adjustments to the program can be made
as needed to promptly resolve problems causing delays. In addition, the United
Nations Center for Regional Development in Nagoya, Japan will assist in reviewing
the project's implementation.

with the Articles of Agreement of the Bank and recommend that the Executive
Directors approve the proposed loan.

PHILIPPINES
EARTHOUAKE RECONSTRUCTION PROJECT
TECHNICAL ANNEX
Background
1.          The Philippine archipelago is one of the most tectonically, and
therefore seismically, active areas in the world. Since 1920, there have been
18 earthquakes recorded in the Philippines with magnitudes of at least 6.5 on
the Richter scale, and historical records from 1589 to the present show that the
Philippines has frequently experienced earthquakes of all intensities with
epicenters distributed throughout the country. The Philippine archipelago is
formed on the east by the Philippine Plate (Philippine Trench), on the west by
the South China Sea Plate (Manila Trench) and on the south by the Borneo Sulu
crustal unit (Sulu Trench). Of these, the most significant is the Philippine
Fault which has been traced for over 1,500 km.   The most recent record of
movement along this fault was a 3.2 meter lateral displacement triggered by the
1973 Ragay Gulf earthquake which had a magnitude of 7.3 on the Richter scale.
The maps are attached.
2.          The earthquake that occurred in north-central Luzon at 4:26 p.m. on
July 16, 1990 was one of the strongest and most destructive earthquakes in recent
Philippine history. The tremor was of tectonic origin, with a magnitude of 7.7
on the Richter scale. Since July 16, there have been over 130 aftershocks, of
which at least 15 have had magnitudes of 5.0 or more. The earthquake consisted
of two subevents, or fractures, along the Philippine Fault northwestward from
Gabaldon to near San Jose and along the Digdig Fault from near San Jose
northward. The earthquake's epicenter was located near the city of Cabanatuan,
about 60 miles north of Manila. The majority of the damage can be attributed
to the direct effects of the earthquake rather than to its indirect impact. The
direct damage can be further divided into that caused by vibration of man-made
facilities and that caused by ground failure.   The former resulted in the
collapse of many buildings and most of the loss of life. The latter, however,
consisting of surface fractures, landslides, differential compaction of the soil,
and liquefaction, produced most of the economic losses. In addition, since the
earthquake occurred during the early stages of the annual monsoon rains, the
danger of landslides will continue as the exposed hills absorb more rain.
3.          The most heavily affected areas cover about 15,000 km2, including the
cities of Baguio, Dagupan, and Cabanatuan and the towns of Agoo, Aringay, Caba
and Sto. Tomas, which received severe damage to their municipal buildings,
markets, schools and housLm.g. At least 1,700 people died, 700 are still missing,
3,500 were injured, and more than 24,000 houses were destroyed. The damage to
public infrastructure and housing is estimated at about P 15 billion (US$600
million), involving mainly roads, bridges, ports, schools, homes and government
buildings.   The total damage to agriculture, private buildings, mining, and

tourism is not known, but the Government is currently assessing the total cost
of the earthquake to the economy.
Government's ResRonse to the Earthguake
4.          To cope with the disaster, the Government formulated a program that
divides the work to be done into three stages: stage 1 - basic emergency repair,
focused on the immediate actions needed to help the people affected during the
first two weeks of the disaster; stage 2 - rehabilitation and recovery, focused
on rapidly implemented works to put vital infrastructure back into service; and
stage 3 - reconstruction and development, focused on the longer-term
reconstruction  effort.    Stage  1 was  directed by  the National  Disaster
Coordinating Committee. Stage 2 is under the direction of the Presidential Task
Force on Rehabilitation which is responsible to coordinate all rehabilitation
projects, monitor the progress of relief efforts, communicate the current status
to the Government and public, liaise with parties for necessary assistance and
coordination, and submit regular status reports on the relief and rehabilitation
efforts. This Task Force will complete its work within a year. Stage 3, under
the National Economic and Development Authority (NEDA), in cooperation with other
government agencies, provides for about 50 days of planning and three to five
years of execution. Actual implementation of the reconstruction work will be
performed by those agencies/departments that would normally be responsible for
the type of work involved. Using criteria set forth in Executive Order No. 419,
the following types of infrastructure have been given priority in the
reconstruction program:   roads and bridges, water supply, power, irrigation,
flood control, communication services, and social infrastructure including homes,
hospitals, schools, and markets.
The Bank's Resoonse
5.          In  response  to  the  Government's  request  for  assistance  in
reconstructing infrastructure damaged by the earthquake, the Bank began immediate
preparation of a possible emergency reconstruction loan while simultaneously
identifying uncommitted funds from the portfolio of existing loans that could
be reallocated to provide immediate financial assistance to the area. The Bank's
initial damage assessment mission, comprising the Resident Representative in
Manila, a highway engineer, and a port consultant, was in the field on July 17,
one day after the earthquake, to assess the situation and gather information
for a possible reconstruction loan. At the request of the Government, a mission
was sent to Manila, beginning August 9, 1990, to identify and appraise the
requested emergency reconstruction project. During appraisal, the uncommitted
balances from the existing loans were reviewed with Government, and about US$79
million was identified that would be reallocated from six existing projects
addressing the needs of the housing, education, ports, irrigation, energy, and
municipal development sectors.   The combined effect of the reallocations of
uncommitted funds from the existing portfolio and the proposed loan will be to
provide the Government with US$204 million or about 34% of the estimated cost
of the Reconstruction Program covering the most urgent needs in eight different
sectors. The list of the existing loans from which the reallocations will be
made is presented in Attachment 2.

Project Descriition
6.          The proposed project will finance reconstruction activities over a
three and one half year period, including: (a) reconstruction investments in
key infrastructure (roads, bridges, and irrigation systems), medical facilities
and housing; (b) financing of critical construction materials and commodities
for the reconstruction effort; and (c) technical assistance for project execution
and the implementation of measures to mitigate earthquake damage in the future,
including the provision of training in geology and seismology and the procurement
of equipment for seismological studies.
7.          Roads and Bridges.   Roads and bridges suffered heavy damage as a
reEult of pavement failure, foundation collapse, and landslides. The proposed
project addresses the most urgent needs in the sector by reconstructing most of
the national highways in the area as well as a large percentage of the local and
provincial roads damaged by the earthquake. The project addresses three phases
of the work: (a) the emergency work that was done by the Department of Public
Works and Highways (DPWH) to open the blocked and damaged roads in the area and
to make the necessary temporary repairs; (b) the reconstruction of certain roads
and bridges to their pre-earthquake condition; and (c) assistance in mitigation
of future disasters by improving slope cuts along the roads and highways and
stabilizing slopes with groundcover and reforestation.   The project will
reconstruct nine major highways in the area which total about 725 km in length
as well as a portion of the provincial and barangay (local) roads in the
provinces of Tarlac, Pangasinan, La Union, Benguet, and Mountain Province. The
highways included in the project are:
(a)   Baguio-Bontoc Road (Halsema Road)
(b)   Manila North Road (Tarlac-San Fernando-La Union)
(c)   Agoo-Baguio Road
(d)   Aritao-Kayapa-Baguio Road
(e)   Lingayen-Dagupan-Damortis Road
(f)   Urdaneta-Dagupan Road
(g)   Bongabon-Baler Road
(h)   Bontoc-Banaue Road
(i)   Camiling-Bayambang-Mangaldan Road
Roads a, b, e, and f were or are currently financed by the Bank; the others were
financed from local funds.
8.          The reconstruction of the roads and bridges will be based-on a geo-
technical evaluation of the present alignment to determine the nature of
existing soil conditions and the design required to prevent similar damage in
the future.   Once this evaluation has been completed and any realignments
determined, the cracked or broken sections of the roads and the approaches to
the bridges will be removed. The supporting layers including the sub-base will
be rebuilt before replacing the surface application. With respect to the bridge
approaches, the use of a structural approach slab will be considered where soil
conditions require. When economically feasible, the bridges will be rebuilt to
the current standard for loading and width. If the existing structure needs to
be demolished and replaced, the demolition work will be carried out as part of



- 17 -                    TECHNICAL
Page 4 of 14
the project with due regard to preservation of the environment. Appropriate
studies will be carried out to mitigate the problems of liquefaction in the
construction of foundations. Where necessary, detour roads and bridges will be
constructed to maintain necessary traffic flows.
9.          To minimize the incidence of future landslides, the slopes will be
recut at critical points.   Where appropriate,  additional drainage will be
provided by vertical ditches, side ditches, subsurface drains and other
facilities. Measures will also be taken to guard against soil erosion, and rock
and debris falls through reforestation and/or the installation of fencing or
other countermeasures. To accomplish these tasks, a survey of the existing and
potential slope disaster locations will be carried out in order to identify those
which should be rehabilitated. The slopes along the Agoo-Baguio Road will be
cut so as to mitigate against future erosion and landslides and thereby attempt
to ensure that at least one road leading to Baguio will not be closed by future
landslides.
10.         Reconstruction of the provincial and barangay roads will include
the repair of slope cuts, reforestation and soil stabilization where feasible,
restoration of damaged drainage facilities, and gravel surfacing. This effort
may include the reconstruction of footbridges which have collapsed due to the
earthquake.   The specific roads to be included in this component will be
identified during the detailed design stage and based on criteria agreed with
the Bank.
11.         Housing.    The housing component of the proposed project would
provide credit to repair or rebuild residential dwellings in the three chartered
cities of Baguio, Cabanatuan, and Dagupan and four key municipalities. Of the
total government program, the Social Insurance System would provide the bulk of
funding (70%), with the Bank financing, under the proposed project, about 13%
of total costs covering 14% of beneficiaries.   Priority has been placed on
reconstruction of totally destroyed or condemned housing. The project would
rebuild about 4,000 dwellings and repair another 2,500 damaged units. Thus, the
Bank would assist about 6,500 households, including about half of those whose
homes were destroyed in the urban centers included in the project.   Bank
assistance would be directed to families below the 70th percentile of the income
curve nearly three quarters of whom fall below the poverty line. The Social
Security System (SSS), Government Services Insurance System (GSIS), and the Home
Development Mutual Fund (HDMF) would make funding available for another 15,300
units, and the National Home Mortgage Finance Corporation (NHMFC) for 3,300.
If funding can be secured, the Department of Social Welfare and Development
(DSWD) will provide another 11,800 units from grant funding for indigent families
and Land Bank 7,900 rural units under credit facilities. Together these six
institutions would provide for the reconstruction and/or repair of 38,300 units
or 41% of the total affected. Including the 6,500 units which would be rebuilt
or repaired under this project (7% of the damage), government's total program
is expected to cover about half of the households affected, including nearly all
units destroyed and about 60% of those damaged in the seven urban areas. The
balance of 48,600 units are expected to be repaired by private individuals
without government assistance, particularly in rural areas where formal
institutional presence is limited and where the bulk of the damage occurred.

12.         Preference would be given to immediate repair and reinforcement of
existing housing wherever this is feasible and cost-effective. Where damage is
more severe or buildings collapsed, reconstruction would be undertaken using
various earthquake resistant designs for traditional and contemporary building
in a range of affordable costs. New structures built by public agencies would
conform to seismic requirements, with designs reviewed by the project's technical
experts and by the Bank.  Proposed sites for development by NHA or private
entities will be inspected for seismic acceptability by the DPWH technical
experts, without charge to NHA or developers.
13.         The project would focus on in-situ repair and reconstruction wherever
possible. Because loans must be secured by a mortgage against titled property,
costs of land acquisition would be included in loan amounts vhere squatters are
able to negotiate purchase. Where land acquisition is not possible, relocation
sites would be provided for families whose homes were totally destroyed. Any
relocation would be strictly voluntary, and would conform to principles agreed
with NHA. The Housing Authority has acquired a 37ha site in Baguio, of which
clear title is available for 17ha, sufficient for about 1,400 units. If found
to be seismically acceptable, a portion of this site would comprise the first
relocation area. Others would be acquired as needed following completion of an
ongoing land tenure study of affected properties. Several sites now titled to



- 19 -                   TECHNCAL
Page 6 of 14
the local government unit in the six other towns are expected to be made
available for relocation.
14.         An understanding regarding the eligibility criteria summarized below
for the proposed project was reached at negotiations. Beneficiaries must:
(a)   be earthquake victims as certified by the DSWD/NHA Master List of
Homeowners;
(b)   have incomes below the 70th percentile of the regional cities income
curve agreed between the Housing and Urban Development Coordinating        I
Council (HUDCC) and the Bank;
(c)   own no other property;
(d)   not be beneficiaries of any other loan from another agency for home
reconstruction/repair; and
(e)   have or attain a satisfactory document of tenure for the land on
which the repair or reconstruction is to occur.
15.         The  Bank-assisted project would be  implemented by  NHMFC via
construction loans to NHA and/or private housing entities who would both act as
builders.   NHA would concentrate on the three chartered cities of Baguio,
Cabanatuan,  and Dagupan and four largest town centers  (para 3).   Once
reconstruction is complete and a mortgage originated by the builder, the
construction loan would be repaid via takeouts by NHMFC of the mortgage paper.
The Bank funds onlent to NHKFC would convert from a construction loan to a long
term mortgage held by NHMFC.
16.         Medical Facilities.  This project component, to be implemented by
the Department of Health (DOH), will provide for: (a) the reconstruction and
repair of hospitals and health care buildings located in the National Capital
Region (NCR) and in the provinces affected by the earthquake; and (b) the
provision of medical equipment to replace that damaged or destroyed during the
earthquake.    The component includes hospital and health care facilities
(administrative buildings, medical centers, main health centers (MHC), barangay
health stations (BHS), rural health units (RHU) and medical staff facilities
under DOH). Private medical facilities are not included.
17.         The proposed reconstruction of totally damaged buildings will
generally be on existing sites, as many structures within the hospital facilities
can be repaired. The proposed program of work is in two phases for both the
reconstruction and repair of hospitals and health care facilities. The first
phase is for the immediate construction of temporary facilities made of
inexpensive materials and the minor repairs required for some buildings to render
them fit for occupancy. The first phase will be implemented within a period of
six months (July - January 1991) and will provide for limited medical facilities
to ensure the provision of basic health care within each community. Additional
medical services will be made available from facilities in adjacent areas that
were not significantly affected by the earthquake until the repair of major



- 20 -                    TECHNICAL-ANNEX
Page 7 of 14
damage and reconstruction is completed. The second phase will be the repair of
major damage and reconstruction of both hospitals and health care facilities.
This will be implemented over a two and one half year period from December 1990
through June 1993, preceded by facility planning, preparation of designs, plans
and tender documents.
18.         Irrigation Systems.  The national and communal irrigation systems
and the related dams sustained both point (buildings, bridges, etc.) and line
damage (canals, roads, etc.) which temporarily interrupted the supply of water
for irrigation. Works to repair this damage under the project have been divided
into two phases:  (a) the ongoing emergency repairs which are expected to be
completed by November 1990; and (b) the reconstruction and restoration of systems
to pre-earthquake conditions.   The project will also provide continuous and
increased desilting until gravity supply may be restored, and concurrent
comprehensive evaluation of the safety of the dams based on state-of-the-art
technology and the installation of seismographic equipment at the Pantabangan
dam. The second phase is expected to be completed in two years.
19.         Repair of the national and communal irrigation systems will require:
(a) reconstruction of destroyed buildings, bridges and related structures; (b)
reconstruction of totally and/or partially destroyed protective dikes, canal
embankments, crossing structures (flumes and siphons), cracked concrete linings,
silt removal, and the removal of landslides; and (c) equipment to assist in
removing a continuous flow of silt of a much higher magnitude than the pre-
earthquake flow. Regarding the last component, the procurement of four draglines
under the project is necessary since the large sediment flow may continue for
several years and cannot be removed with existing equipment of the National
Irrigation Administration (NIA), which is unable to rent suitable equipment
locally in sufficient quantities. NIA also requires portable pumps to supply
water from the main canals into the distribution systems because of inoperable
turnouts. The project will therefore provide about 450 portable centrifugal
pumps of various sizes for this purpose along with other minor pieces of
equipment.   Damage to the two major dams and the related saddle dams was
relatively minor, but potentially hazardous if ignored, and will require repairs
to the power and irrigation tunnels and slope protection to avoid the immediate
danger of collapse and reduction in the operating level of the reservoirs.
20.         Civil works represent about 90% of project irrigation costs and are
widely distributed throughout the provinces in the affected area. The emergency
works which were initiated by NIA immediately following the earthquake have been
implemented under force account. Where required, NIA has supplemented its own
equipment pool by rentals from the private sector in accordance with its
equipment rental rates.   No major problems have been reported to date in
implementation, and works are generally on schedule.
21.         Critical Construction NaterLals and Commodities.  The project will
finance materials which have been identified as essential for the implementation
of the proposed project. The construction materials to be imported consist of
cement, lime, ingots, iron and steel, roof sheets, pipes, pipe fittings, timber,
and critical commodities (petroleum). The nature and amount of the materials
and commodities to be financed by the project are based on an analysis of the



- 21 -                  TECHNICAL ANNEX
Page 8 of 14
needs of each of the project components. Loan proceeds will be managed by the
CB which will make foreign exchange available to public and private importers
through normal channels. The project would finance about 16% of the estimated
increase in the required materials and commodities to be imported during 1991
over 1990 levels. The items would be procured in accordance with the Bank's
guidelines, and all of the items would be procured through inteinational
competitive bidding (ICB) or international shopping (see para 31).
22.         Technical Assistance.  Technical assistance would be provided for
project implementation as well as the implementation of measures to mitigate
earthquake damage in the future, including the provision of training in geology
and seismology and the procurement of equipment for seismological studies. Draft
terms of reference for the selection of the proposed experts have been provided
to the relevant government agencies, and the Bank has agreed to assist the
Government in identifying concessionary financing for these consultants.
23.         The technical consulting support of structural engineers, geo-
technical engineers, and slope protection experts would be needed to assist in
the preparation of detailed designs, contract supervision, the provision of
advice to PIUs on implementation issues, the preparation of Reconstruction
Proposals (RPs) and the revision of current building codes. The reconstruction
efforts of each governmental unit would be supported by an integrated RP. The
experts engaged under the project would ensure that the units preparing these
plans avoid the temptation of merely repairing and/or retro-fitting structures
to their pre-earthquake strength and/or stiffness or rebuilding structures in
the same place using the same materials, configuration, structural system,
foundation, and techniques, without considering superior alternatives. The team
of experts would therefore investigate the affected areas and make
recommendations regarding buildings and structures that have to be demolished
or those that can be economically rehabilitated.  The team will advise the
governmental units on the development of regulations regarding the number of
stories, structural systems, and type of foundations that should be used in the
design  and  construction  of  new  buildings.    They  will  also  formulate
recommendations on how to upgrade existing structures that suffered damage, and
plan for drainage, water supply, and other facilities as well as rehabilitation
of the road network. Due to the urgency of beginning reconstruction of the
damaged area and the need to ensure that the work is adequately coordinated, it
was agreed at negotiations that preparation of the Reconstruction Proposals
should start as soon as possible, with completion by March 31, 1991. Once these
plans have been prepared, they will be promptly reviewed by a technical panel
of experts satisfactory to the Bank. Each governmental unit should review its
building code in conjunction with the preparation of its RP and make those
revisions that are necessary to reflect local conditions.
24.         Project-supported training in geology and seismology would be
provided in two forms. The first would be a program of continuing professional
training to be conducted in the Philippines by a team of recognized experts in
the fields of geo-technical engineering and seismology. The program would be
designed to upgrade the engineering profession and to start the development of
reliable "seismic zonation maps. U Structural engineers would help develop "micro
zonation maps" for key urban areas throughout the Philippines to lower their



- 22 -                    TECHNICAL ANNEX
Page 9 of 14
vulnerability to future earthquakes and typhoons. The second type of training
would consist of locally-developed courses for structural engineers, private
contractors and provincial and municipal engineers in order to increase their
knowledge of geo-technical engineering and to expose them to procedures that must
be employed to reduce the probability of future earthquake damage.
25.         Local capabilities in earthquake damage mitigation would be further
buttressed by the procurement, under the project, of seismic monitoring
instruments (strong motion equipment) expected to cost about US$2.0 million.
Despite the existence of several accelerographs throughout the earthquake area,
no accelerogram was recorded during the July 16 earthquake. A carefully planned
network of strong motion instruments is needed to study seismic wave propagation
and develop attenuation laws, as well as to study local site effects, topography
and local geological effects and the intensity, frequency, content and duration
of strong motions for the formulation of reliable seismic codes. The network
would be connected by telephone and/or single-sideband radios from each station
to report periodically.   Institutional strengthening should accompany the
equipment acquisition to ensure better use and maintenance of existing and new
instruments.
Proiect Cost and Financing
26.         Cost Estimates.  The total project cost (Attachment 4), including
contingencies, is estimated at P 4.6 billion or US$183 million equivalent, with
a foreign exchange component of 58%. Base costs, expressed in mid-year 1990
prices, reflect rates for ongoing contracts for various types of works. Price
contingencies, equivalent to 8% of base costs plus physical contingencies, are
based on local inflation rates of 8% for 1990-95, and foreign inflation rates
of 2.6% in 1991, 4.1% in 1992, 5.4% in 1993, and 4.7% in 1994-95.  Physical
contingencies, totaling about 8% of base costs, were calculated on the basis of
10% for equipment, civil works for roads and bridges, and medical facilities,
and 20% for irrigation. The project cost includes taxes and duties of P 240
million (US$9.6 million equivalent).
27.         Financing Plan.  The Bank would finance US$125 million or about 70%
of total project costs, representing 100% of estimated foreign exchange
requirements and 25% of local financing. The remaining costs would be covered
by the Government, split between DPWH (22%), NIA (4%), NHA (2%), and DOH (2%)
as shown in Table 2.   During negotiations,  it was agreed that adequate
counterpart financing will be made available promptly to participating agencies.
Extensive cash contributions and self-help efforts by homeowners in
reconstructing and repairing their own homes, community facilities, and communal
irrigation systems have not been included in the project cost but would represent
a major supplement to Government and Bank funding. While provision has been made
for Bank financing of technical assistance, training, equipment and studies,
Government intends to seek grants for these components with Bank assistance.
Any loan funds so replaced with grant financing would be utilized for other
components of the project, as agreed between the Government and the Bank.

Proiect Management
28.         The project would be implemented over a three and one half year
period, using the Government's existing organizational framework and the line
agencies' technical expertise in monitoring and supervising implementation of
their respective project components. A small Project Coordinating Unit (PCU)
would be created under the jurisdiction of DPWH to monitor and coordinate the
activities of the entire project. Each region would have a Steering Committee
formed by the Regional Development Council (RDC) under the direction of NEDA to
advise the PCU on local conditions and to facilitate project implementation.
The PCU would be responsible for collecting data from the Project Implementation
Units (PIU) established in each line agency along with a summary of the physical
progress of each component in order to prepare quarterly and annual reports that
will be submitted to the Bank, the Government's Project Facilitation Committee,
and to the Steering Committees.   The Steering Committees will also meet
periodically with the PCU for a formal review of project progress. In addition
to its monitoring and reporting functions, the PCU will be supplemented by geo-
technical consultants who will provide technical advice to the implementing
agencies on the location and design of works. The PIUs would be responsible for
actual implementation of works, but will use the consultants provided by the PCU
to help review detailed designs and advise on the suitability of their site
selections. In staffing the PIUs, the agencies may also need to augment the
government staff with outside consultants to assist in carrying out detailed



- 24 -                   TECHNICAL ANNEX
Page 11 of 14
designs, procurement, contracting, and the supervision of construction. The PIUs
will be responsible for all procurement, contracting and submission of
disbursement applications to the Bank, and in providing the necessary data to
the PCU in a timely manner so that the reporting and monitoring functions can
be properly performed.   It was agreed at negotiations  that the various
implementing agencies will employ both local and foreign consultants to serve
as technical and project advisors for the PIUs to ensure that project
implementation proceeds as quickly as possible and in accordance with appropriate
geo-technical standards. Terms of reference for the expert consultants for the
PCU and the technical and project advisors for the PIUs will be submitted to the
Bank for review in October. It was also agreed that Government will assign and
maintain a sufficient number of qualified staff at each of the PIUs and the PCU,
and will name a project manager for each, who is satisfactory to the Bank, to
ensure that the project is implemented as planned. No problems are envisioned
with project start-up since the first year's works are ready for immediate
implementation. The project implementation schedule is shown in Attachment 5.
Procurement
29.         Civil Works.  Large civil works contracts for national roads and
bridges valued at US$2.5 million or more will be procured using international
competitive bidding (ICB) procedures, which together with major equipment
purchases represents about 31% of total project expenditures. Most other civil
works are expected to be too widely dispersed and small to attract the attention
of foreign bidders.  Therefore, about 31% of the total expenditures will be
procured through local competitive bidding procedures (LCB) governed by PD 1594
as revised, which has been reviewed and found satisfactory by the Bank based on
an understanding reached at negotiations.
30.         Due to the emergency nature of the project, up to 20% of total
expenditures will cover commitments for the early rehabilitation work necessary
to restore basic services in the areas affected. The following procedures were
used for these initial commitments: (a) force account; (b) shopping; and (c)
direct contracting.
31.         Goods and Commodities.   Goods and equipment contracts valued at
US$200,000 or more will be procured by ICB, including approximately US$2 million
of strong motion equipment. Approximately 14% of project expenditures (20% of
the loan) would be disbursed against contracts for the import of the following
construction materials which are all required for reconstruction: cement, lime,
ingots, iron and steel, roof sheets, tubes, pipes, pipe fittings, timber (logs),
and critical commodities (petroleum). It is estimated that up to US$8 million
would be required for petroleum and would be financed under the proposed project.
Contracts for the importation of construction materials and commodities valued
at US$5.0 million or more will be procured using ICB procedures. If the material
is a commonly traded commodity in world markets, the ICB procedures used may,
with prior Bank approval, be simplified to include use of standard practices
followed by the applicable international commodity market. Contracts valued at
less than US$5.0 million in the private sector will be procured using the
purchaser's normal commercial practices. Public sector import contracts valued
at less than US$5.0 million will be procured using the government's normal LCB



- 25 -
TECHNICAL NX
Page 12 of 14
procedures acceptable to the Bank, simplified to reflect the nature of the
commodity.
32.         Technical Assistance.  Training and Studies.   Project technical
assistance, training and studies comprising 4% of total expenditures will be
engaged or carried out under terms of reference acceptable to the Bank and
following the Bank's Guidelines for the Use of Consultants.   Sole source
procedures will be permitted for the selection of engineering firms to perform
the critical engineering and design work needed prior to highway reconstruction,
provided the qualifications of the firms selected and their proposed rates are
acceptable to the Bank.
33.         Review of Procurement Documents and Decisions.  Project civil works
contracts with an estimated value of US$200,000 and commodity import contracts
with an estimated value of US$5.0 million or more will be subject to prior Bank

Disbursement
34. The proceeds of the Bank loan would be disbursed against eligible
expenditures as follows:
(a) Eguipment and Materials:
(i)100% of the CIF cost of directly imported construction materials and
commodities;
(ii)for equipment purchases, 65% if imported and locally procured, 100% of
the CIF cost if directly imported, and 100% of the ex-factory cost if locally
manufactured;
(b)Civil Works:
(i)60% of the cost of civil works for roads and bridges;
(ii)70% of the cost of hospital/health facilities and irrigation systems;
(c)Housing Credji: 70% of total expenditures; and
(d) Technical Assistance. Training and Studies: 100% of total expenditures.
35. A Special Account would be established in US dollars at the Central Bank
for the housing component with an initial deposit of US$1.0 million, equal to
about four months of expenditures, from which project outlays will be reimbursed.
Disbursements may be made against Statements of Expenditure (SOEs) for contracts
below US$200,000 equivalent to finance minor works and goods and for housing
credit components. SOE applications would be certified by the executing agency
with supporting documentation retained by the agency and made available for
periodic inspection by the Bank.
36. The Bank loan of US$125 million would be implemented over a period of three
and one half years, and disbursed over four years, closing on March 31, 1995.
No appropriate Bank profile exists for this kind of multi-sectoral reconstruction
loan. Expenditures made after July 17, 1990, the date of the Bank's first damage
assessment mission, up to a ceiling of US$25 million would be eligible for retro-
active financing for the removal of debris, opening of roads, providing temporary
hospitals and medical facilities. The Disbursement Schedule is presented in
Attachment 6.
Accounts and Auditing
37. The implementing agencies would maintain separate records and accounts of
all transactions under the loan which would be audited by an independent external
auditor acceptable to the Bank. The project accounts would be summarized on an
ongoing basis to show:
(a)actual versus planned expenditures for each quarter;



- 27 -                   TECHNICAL ANNEX
Page 14 of 14
(b)actual versus planned expenditures to date; and
(c)financing of the expenditures by the Bank and the Government.
In addition, the project accounts would show separately the expenditures related
to applications submitted on the basis of SOEs, as opposed to those expenditures
requiring submission of documentation to the Bank.  Appended to the project
accounts submitted by the PCU would be a listing of the withdrawal applications
for the period concerned showing the amounts reimbursed.  Unaudited project
accounts, with the above attachments, would be submitted by the PCU on a
quarterly basis to reach the Bank within 45 days after the end of the quarter.
The audited project accounts, including the SOEs and Special Account, accompanied
by the auditor's report, opinion, and comments on the project accounts, SOEs
and Special Account would be forwarded to the Bank within six months of the end
of each fiscal year.  The auditor would provide a separate opinion on those
expenditures made using SOEs.
Environmental and Social Impact
38. The project will have a positive impact on the environment. Stabilization,
contouring and, where possible, reforestation of slopes on major roads will help
prevent soil erosion and landslides in these ecologically delicate mountainous
zones and thus a repetition of the extent of damage which resulted from the July
earthquake. Prompt repair of the irrigation system will help avert potentially
serious crop failures later in the year, and the adverse impact on a wide range
of flora and fauna which would accompany such a failure. Earthquake damage
mitigation measures carried out under the project should aid government in
gradually improving construction design standards and inspection procedures,
reducing damage from future earthquakes in both urban and rural environments.
Reconstruction of homes destroyed by the quake will have a strong positive social
impact, with resettlement restricted to cases where present sites are unstable
and dangerous, e.g., those where liquefaction occurred. Improved environmental
designs will also be incorporated in the Reconstruction Plans being prepared by
the municipalities with specialized advice.
ReDorting and Monitoring
39. The PCU would prepare a quarterly report on the project based on the reports
of each agency, showing the physical progress against the plan for each
component, with an explanation of any significant delay from the plan and
outlining what remedial actions are being taken. The report should be submitted
to the Bank concurrent with the unaudited quarterly project accounts discussed
above. In addition, the quarterly and annual reports will be submitted to the
Steering Committees and to the Government's Faeilitation Committee. A project
completion report will be prepared within six months of the closing date of the
loan.
