PREFACE
This is the project Performance Audit Report (PPAR) of the Karonga
Rural Development Project, Phase II, National Rural Development Program (NRDI)
Phase I Project, National Rural Development Program (NRDP) Phase III Project, and
National Rural Development Program (NRDP) Phase IV Project in Malawi.  They
involved respectively a Third Window loan of US$9.2 milliotn, and IDA credits of
US$22 million, SDR 6.5 million (US$7.3 million) and SDR 9.8 million (US$10.6
million). The loan/credits were approved on June 30, 1976* November 28, 1978,
October 13, 1981 and April 5, 1983 respectively. The full amount of the Karonga
II loan was ditwbursed; cancellations on NRDP Phase I and III credits were
respectively US$2.89 million and US$2.05 million.   The Closing Dates were:
Karonga II project December 31, 1981, National Rural Development I project June
30 1986, National Rural Development III project September 30, 1988 and National
Rural Development IV project September 30 1990.   Final disbursements were:
Karonga II project February 17, 1982, National Rural Development I project
October 22, 1986, National Rural Development III project May 31, 1989 and
National Rural Development IV project March 22, 1991.
The PPAR is based on the Project Completion Reports (PCRs)1/ of the
first three projects, the Staff Appraisal and Presidert's Reports, the
loan/credit documents and on a study of project files and discussions with Bank
staff  in Washington  and  Lilongwe.    An  OED  mission  visited  Malawi  in
September/October 1990 and discusbed the projects with Ministry of Agriculture
officials and with staff of the Lilongwe and Karonga Agricultural Development
Divisions.   The mission met with farmers and field staff personnel in the
I/    Project Completion Reports: (i) Malawi: Second Karonga Rural Development
Project Phase II (Loan 1286-T-MAI), Report No. 5340, November 28, 1984;
(ii) Malawi: National Rural Development Program Phase I (Credit 857-MAI),
Report No.  6797,  June  2,  1987  and  (iii}  Malawi:    National Rural
Development Program (NRDP) - Phase III Project (Credit 1183-MAI), May 22,
1990. The Karonga II PCR was prepared by the Ministry of Agriculture and
the Bank's Regional Mission in East Africa; the PCR for National Rural
Development I was prepared by the Bank's Regional projects staff; the PCR
for National Rural Development III was prepared partly by the Ministry of
Agriculture and partly by the FAO/World Bank Cooperative Program.

(LOAN 1286-T-MAI and CREDITS 857-MAI. 1183-MAI and 1343-HAI)
I. INTRODUCTION
1.1         This is a combined or 'cluster' audit of Phase II of the Karonga
Rural Development Project (Loan 1286-T-MAI), and Phases I, III and IV of the
National Rural Development Program (NRDP) (Credits 857-MAI, 1183-MAI and
1343-MAI).j/ The approval dates of these four projects range from June 1976 to
April 1983, with the last project (NRDP IV) closing in September 1990.
1.2         These four projects are the continuation of a series of World Bank
integrated area/rural development projects in Malawi vhich began in February 1968
with the first phases of the Lilongwe Land Development Program (Cr 113-MA1) in
central Malawi and the Shire Valley Development Project (Cr 114-MAI) in southern
Malawi.  These were the first IDA-funded agricultural projects in the country.
Each of these had two subsequent phases financed by individual IDA credits.2/
The fourth phase of the Lilongwe Land Development Program was financed by NRDP
I, one of the projects being audited here. A third set of area development
projects was in the Karonga Region in northern Malawi. Phase I (Cr 282-MAI) was
approved in early 1971. Phase II is one of the projects being audited here.
Phase III, under the project description of NRDP III, is also being audited here.
1.3         These integrated area development projects subsequently gave way to
a more extensive type of rural development strategy which came to be known as the
National Rural Development Program (NRDP). The strategy was initially proposed
by a Bank agricultural sector mission in 1973. The first IDA financing for NRDP
was included in Phase III of the Lilongwe Land Development Program (LLDP)
approved in early 1975. Further financing for start-up operations was included
in Phase II of the Karonga Rura'l Development Project (KRDP) of June 1976; indeed
it had been originally proposed to call this project NRDP I.  The main IDA
financing of NRDP began with the first NRDP project of November 1978 and was
continued in NRDP III and IV. The projects un6er audit here thus straddle the
tran.Ltion between the original area-based integrated development strategy and
the subsequent rural development strategy of NRDP.

1.4         This is the ninth audit/evaluation by OED of area/rural development
financing in Malawi, and t? e first to cover the period after the adoption of the
NRDP strategy.3/ In addition the whole of the Bank's agricultural lending to
Malawi was evaluated by OED in an Agricultural Sector Operations Review, (Report
No. 5387 of December 1984).   This review was, however, more concerned with
comparing the Bank's experiences in Malawi with those in Burkina Faso than with
evaluating the NRDP as such.  Because the present audit is a cluster audit
covering four projects with experience of area/rural development implementation
spread over fourteen years it provides an excellent opportunity to evaluate the
evolution and impact of Bank-assisted rural development lending in a single
country, more particularly since parts of the projects being audited are
continuations of earlier projects. The total period covered stretches from early
1968 to late 1990. In making this evaluation of past projects the audit will
inevitably also have to take into account tho continued evolution of Malawil's
rural development strategy, and the Bank's involvement in it during the
implementation of NRDP IV. Of particular interest is the sustainability of the
whole concept and strategy of rural development in Malawi as it has emerged over
time and become integrated into the fabric of the Government's management of the
economy.   The audit will also be of interest in the context of OED's 1988
Operations Evaluation Study Rural Development. World Bank Experience 1965-86.
While a brief 'profile' of the Malawian experience of rural development was
included in that study this audit will provide the chance to examine some of the
specific issues raised in more detail in the context of Malawi.
II. PROJECT FORMULATION. OBJECTIVES AND DESIGN
2.1         The Lilongwe Land Development Program (LLDP) was one of a number of
pioneering projects being developed in the late 1960. by the World Bank in its
search for more effective ways to counter both food shortages and maldistribution
of income in daveloping countries. There was little experience to guide project
formulation. A pilot scheme in one village area, Tobango, within the project
area, was under implementation at the time of appraisal and provided a partial
basis for the design of the larger program, including information on unit costs,
etc. In addition, the Bank staff involved in preparation and appraisal had long
experience in other parts of Africa, particularly Kenya and brought with them the
concept of planning for integrated activity long before this became fashionable
within the Bank; LLDP thus became the first of the Bank's IRDPs. The situatilon
at the time is well described by Lele. Writing about Ethiopia and Malawi she
describes how Bank staff at that time recognized that both countries, although
3/    Three audits covered the first three phases of LLDP:  Report No. 751 of
May 1975, No. 1597 of May 1977 and No. 3414 of April 1981; three audits
covered the three phases of Shire Valley: Report Nos. 895 of 1975, No.
2593 of June 1979 and No. 6171 of 1986; in addition the three phases were
the subject of an Impact Evaluation 3tudy, Report No. 4580 of December
1983; and Phase I of KRDP was audited in Report No. 2576 of June 1979.



having low levels of income, also had regions with obviously high development
potential.
"These appeared to offer a good opportunity to make a substantial impact
on the levels of living of the low-income rural populations in selected
regions.   However,  even by contemporary African standards,  the two
countries were endowed with relatively little physical or institutional
infrastructure or trained manpower. Therefore, to make a noticeable impact
in a short period and to deal with the complementaries in production and
to some extent in consumption, substantial simultaneous investment was
deemed necessary in a number of activities, including agricultural
extension, credit, marketing, roads, soil conservation, training,
cooperative  development,  and  water  supply.        Because  the  rural
administrations in Ethiopia and Malawi have had very limited capacity to
absorb and utilize finances at the district and divisional levels .....
both countries were ill-equipped to take on large-scale development
functions ..... The inadequacy of the existing institutions to administer
complex multi-sectoral programs and the absence of well-articulated
national  commitments  to  bring  about  substantial  political  and
administrative improvements led expatriate planners to view the
establishment of autonomous project authorities as a logical way of making
a noticeable impact and, thus, of exercising a demonstration effect on
policy makers, administrators, and, of course, on the rural people."4/
2.2         It has also been pointed out that the IRDPs were direct descendants
of the colonial policies of the 1950., which viewed land use and tenure as major
obstacles to development, in the belief that sustained increases in productivity
would only occur through fundamental changes in husbandry practices, the physical
layout of land holdings and in land tenure.5/  Although the projects which

University Press for the World Bank, 1975.  pp.  127-8
I/    See Kydd J.C. and Spooner N.J., "The World Bank's Analysis of Malawian
Agriculture: Changing Perspectives 1966 to 1985", a working paper prepared
for Managing Agricultural Development in Africa, World Bank, 1987.  In
"The World Bank Since Bretton Woods" (Brookings Institution 1973) Mason
and Asher single out Lilongwe for its "considerable innovation" as the
first example of the Bank's response to the cry for an integrated approach
to rural development. They single out the extensive help provided by the
Bank's Agricultural Development Service (ADS) in preparation and comment
that "the cumulative experience of the ADS staff, many of whom had been in
the (British) colonial service and were familiar with past British
successes and failures, is considered to be an important factor in the
success of the Lilongwe Project." The appraisal mission leader for the
Lilongwe and Shire Valley Projects has commented that both these projects
relied heavily on on-going pilot projects for design and formulation; on
the ODA project in Lilongwe in the one case and on a German-financed
cotton project on the Salima Lakeshore in the other. Also the design of

tried to implement this philosophy had not been very successful, LLDP
incorporated many of these concerns. The design of these original IRDPs was thus
more the result of the time and place of their origin than one that was
inherently necessary to raising rural living standards.   In particular the
combination within a single project of infrastructure and social components
together with directly production raising components was seen as necessary both
because of their complementarity and because there Was no existing rural
administration which could implement the infrastructure and social components
separately; and the autonomous project organization staffed by expatriates came
about because of the shortage of trained local staff and because the need to make
a noticeable impact rapidly did not allow time to build local competence. The
way in which these characteristics came to be changed and the reasons behind the
changes are examined later.
2.3         Lilongwe was selected as the location of the first IRDP in Malawi
because it was recognized as an area of high agricultural potential that was
threatened by rapidly accelerating soil erosion and increasing population
pressure that could lead to land fragmentation and a purely subsistence
agriculture. The objective of the program was to raise agricultural production
(maize, tobacco and groundnuts) by increasing yields and expanding the cultivated
area so as to move agriculture towards a market economy, particularly to
alleviate the perceived threat of localized food shortages.  This was to be
achieved by changing farmers' attitudes, converting them from a subsistence
orientation towards production for the market.   The program's intermediate
objectives included infrastructure development (feeder roads, market facilities,
domestic water supply, soil conservation works and buildings) and provision of
services to farmers (extension, marketing, credit, input supply, land use
planning and land registration). The second phase project modified the exclusive
crop orientation of the first phase by the inclusion of livestock activities; in
the third phase health facilities were included.  Originally conceived as a
13-year program covering just over 200,000 ha the area was later expanded to
486,000 ha with 109,000 farm families, representing about 10 per cent of the
country's rural population.   The program was financed by three IDA credits
totalling US$ 21.75 million, implemented between 1968 and 1978 and completed in
a fourth phase as part of the National Rural Development Project under audit.
The 13-year time frame was thus more or less adhered to.
2.4         The LLDP was not originally intended as a model of a particular
approach to rural development. Within a few years, however, it came to be seen
as, in the words of the OED audit of Phase I, "a showpiece for package-style
integrated development". Its design was widely followed in many future Bank
projects, both within Malawi for the Shire Valley and Karonga RDPe, and
elsewhere, particularly in the agricultural development projects in Nigeria. The
Press Release for Karonga I (January 1972) goes as far as to say that this
integrated approach "has come to be regarded by the World Bank as a crucial
strategy in attacking the problems of rural poverty that abound in many parts of
the first phase of Karonga drew heavily for its rice-growing components on
on-going rice schemes in the Northern Region financed by ODA and Taiwan.

Africa." This success in implementation was attributed to strong and flexible
management and an ability to adapt to changing circumstances. It was a success,
nevertheless, that was circumscribed. In terms of physical construction most of
the appraisal estimates were met on, and frequently ahead, of time and within and
often below cost. It was also seen as a model in terms of its involvement of the
local population. In terms of meeting food production objectives, however, LLDP
must be considered with hindsight a failure, although for most of the
implementation period it was considered moderately successful in this respect,
even if perhaps not as successful as predicted at appraisal. This is considered
later. In terms of institution building and training of local staff to take over
management responsibilities the Program was also criticized. The OED audit of
Phase III (Highlights) summarizes these points.
"The physical implementation of the program was a success. Government
gave qualified and motivated expatriate staff support and the needed
flexibility to direct an efficient and timely construction of project
works. Within the constraints imposed by the policy framework and the
country's overall conditions, project management also succeeded in
providing farmers with reasonably efficient extension, credit and
marketing services. The major shortfall of this program is that despite
the progress made, it did not go far enough in lessening Malawi's
dependence on outside technical assistance and in contributing to the
creation in Malawi of an internally generated, self-sustained development
process."
2.5         By the early 1970s IRDPs following virtually identical designs to
LLDP were in operation in three other parts of Malawi; in the Shire Valley in the
south and Karonga District in the north, both financed by IDA; and in Salima on
the Malawi lakeshore funded initially by the Federal Republic of Germany and
later by the European Development Fund. These four projects together covered
about one-fifth of the rural population.
2.6         The problem facing the Government was that it had to find a way to
provide similar facilities to the other four-fifths of the population in order
to raise food production and rural living standards nationally and avoid creating
regional income disparities. The solution was sought through planned phasing of
development. The country would be divided up into 40 Development Areas. Each
area would go through a 15-18 year development sequence so that over a 20-year
period the whole country would be covered. The sequence was seen as divided into
four phases. Phase one would be a 2-3 year pregaratorY phase when, following
detailed planning, the essential infrastructure would be put in place and
additional extension staff recruited. A five year extensive phase would come
next, concentrating on directly production-related investment. Phase 3, also of
5 years, would be an Intensive phase with more emphasis on research, land
improvement, animal husbandry, new roads.  The final or consolidation phase,
while continuing with the intensive developments, would involve further
improvements to social infrastructure, especially education and health. This was
to be incorporated Into a National Rural Development Program (NRDP) in which the
various phases would be inter-related so that the number on-going at any one time
would be within Malawi's financial and human resource limits. The level of



- 6 -
investment in any one area at any one moment would thus be less than under the
IRDP system but in the end, spread out over a longer period of time, would meet
the same development goals.  The basic philosophy of the complementarity of
simultaneous investment in many sectors was maintained and NRDP would continue
to finance multi-component, cross-ministerial activities.   According to the
appraisal report of NRDP (para 2.02) the level of infrastructure would be
'necessarily'  less intensive than under existing projects.   The fact that
previous IRDPs had not been successful in raising agricultural production as
intended had not become apparent at the time NRDP was conceived and so their
basic project design and strategy was not questioned, the component mix was
merely adjusted slightly.
2.7         The intensity of extension coverage would also be evened up under
NRDP. Under the IRDPs the farmer:extension worker ratio had been as low as 10:1
(Shire Valley) compared to the 1,500-2,000:1 in non-project areas. In LLDP the
ratio was planned to be 200:1 in the initial phase, rising eventually to 500:1.
In Karonga the ratios were 30:1 initially, rising to 350:1. Under NRDP the
desired national ratio was 500:1 but it was recognized that insufficient staff
would be available within the 20-year period to reach that level and that 750:1
was a more realistic target.
2.8         Such a major program also required reorganizing and strengthening the
Ministry of Agriculture (MOA, at that time called the Ministry of Agriculture and
Natural Resources) so as to be able to manage such a large diverse program and
integrate it into the Government structure. The existing IRDPs were all discrete
entities as far as Government was concerned, with their project management and
staff forming distinct units within the Ministry, separate from the organization
of the rest of its activities. They would be grouped, along with all the other
demarcated Development Areas, into eight Agricultural Development Divisions
(ADD), each of which would be run by a Management Unit (MU). These MUs would
absorb the IRDP management structure.   A newly created Chief Agricultural
Development Officer would be responsible for overall implementation at the MOA
level.
2.9         It took about five years from the time the NRDP concept was
originally proposed until the first NRDP project was approved at the end of 1978.
During this time the Bank continued to finance the old style IRDPs; Phase III of
Lilongwe (Cr 550 of 3/75), Phase II of Karonga (Loan 1286-T of 6/76) and Phase
III of Shire Valley (Cr. 823 of 7/78). Both the Lilongwe Phase III and the
Karonga Phase II projects contained financing for the preparatory phases of NRDP
but in all other respects their design seems to have been largely uninfluenced
by the new thinking that was going on. The core components of Karonga II, under
audit here, were for instance (i) the continued provision of agricultural and
livestock services and infrastructure in Karonga District, begun under the first
phase IRDP, and its expansion on a similar design to the adjoining Chitipa
District, a sparsely populated and remote area; and (ii) the completion of the
Lake Transport component, again started under the first phase to improve
communications between Karonga and the rest of Malawi since road communications
were virtually non-existent. The NRDP component was only added at appraisal.



2.10        The first NRDP project was designed to assist the Government to
implement the first five-year phase of the program. It contained four components:
completion of the LLDP; financing the 'extensive' phase in eight new Development
Areas (Das); strengthening four Management Units in the newly created ADDs; and
strengthening  the Ministry's  central  services management  capacity.    The
Development Areas were selected on a number of criteria; areas having high but
largely  undeveloped  potential;  areas  where  farmers  seemed  particularly
innovative; areas of food deficit; areas having ready accessibility or areas
needed to provide an even regional balance.  The project was co-financed with
four other donors, The Canadian International Development Agency (CIDA), the
European Development Fund (EDF), the United Kingdom and the Federal Republic of
Germany.  The CIDA funding was made directly to IDA.  The combined CIDA-IDA
funding was used to finance the completion of LLDP (which now became a
Development Area in Lilongwe ADD), three of the eight new Development Areas
(Thiwi-Lifidzi and Ntcheu in Lilongwe ADD and Mzimba in Mzuzu ADD), one of the
Management Units (Lilongwe) and the Minisory strengthening, with EDF providing
the equipment for the Ministry's construction unit. The other five Development
Areas and three Mus were financed by the other donors. The Government hoped, by
bringing all external financing under one umbrella project, to simplify its
coordination of donors.
2.i1        The Bank's second NRDP project was designed to assist the Government
in the development of the country's forestry resources so as to provide a
sustainable energy supply while conserving the natural forests and the
environment. It does not fit in with the theme of this audit, the evolution of
IRDPs into the NRDP, and is thus not covered here.
2.12        The third NRDP project, approved in March 1982, financed the third
phase of the Karonga IRDP. Although included under the overall NRDP umbrella,
the project design appears to owe nothing to the new concepts that had been
developed, nor to the findings of an NRDP Review Mission which the Bank had
mounted in 1981. The farmertextenGion worker ratio was to remain at the 350:1
level reached in Phase II. The range of multi-sector components increased with
the inclusion of new forestry, soil conservation and livestock activities and the
introduction of a health component, although the road construction component was
dropped.   There is no indication of any attempt being made to concentrate
resources on the more immediately productive aspects of agricultural investment,
as might have been expected.    However,  the  increased emphasis  on  soil
conservation, watershed management and afforestation was in line with the NRDP
policies.
2.13        An NRDP Review Mission was mounted by the Bank in 1981 to carry out
a mid-term review of NRDP.  It recommended that the complexity of the rural
development projects should be reduced and efforts focussed mainly on
production-related agricultural activities and that investments in other sectors
- rural roads, health, forestry *tc. - should be included wherever practicable
in on-going or forthcoming national investment programs other than NRDP. This
would improve the future maintenance and staffing of these investments and allow
agricultural staff to concentrate on their own tasks. It proposed some changes
in the organization and structure at the field level, including a higher ratio



- 8 -
of farmers to extension staff.  It suggested ways in which to reduce capital
costs, particularly in staff housing.   In addition, it recommended ways to
rationalize the use and improve the effectiveness of resources directly related
to agricultural production. These included, among others, developing a national
livestock program that would set prtorities for disease control and marketing as
well as ways to reorient the extension and research services towards existing
farming systems and constraints faced by farmers.   As a result of these
recommendations the design of the fourth Bank NRDP project was much more in line
with the original NRDP concepts than had been the earlier NRDP projects. It was
located in the two Development Areas of Lilongwe ADD that had not so far
benefitted from external financing (Lilongwe North East and Dedza Hills). Its
components were more directly production-oriented. The originally proposed roads
and health components were dropped. It placed more emphasis on adaptive research
trials. The ratio of farmers to extension workers was a more sustainable 800:1.
Nevertheless the project objective still remained the same as that which the Bank
had been pushing for fourteen years, ever since Lilongwe I had started, and which
had consistently failed, 'to reduce the areas under food crops (i.e. local maize)
by introducing higher yielding packages and therefore releasing foodcrop land for
cash crops'. (NRDP IV, Project Brief of March 11, 1982 para 29).
2.14        The Karonga Phase II and the NRDP I, III and IV are the projects
audited here. They were also the last area-based NRDP projects that the Bank has
financed in Malawi. Subsequent projects concentrated on tackling specific sector
bottlenecks at the national level although the Agricultural Extension and
Planning Support Project (Cr. 1626-MAI) did have an area component for Mzuzu.
Other donors have subsequently financed all the other RDPs except one. Part of
this change in the method of support to the agriculture sector can be attributed
to the change in Malawi's macro-economic prospects which occurred after about
1980. Part of it, however, stemmed from the growing realization that area-based
financing was failing to tackle some of the fundamental sector problems which
were preventing the area-based programs from attaining their objectives.
III. IMPLEMENTATION
3.1         Project Completion Reports have been prepared for Karonga II, NRDP
I and NRDP III.6/ The fourth NRDP project did not yet have a PCR at the time
of the audit. The audit found that the descriptions of the implementation of the
projects contained in the three PCRs are fair summaries of the course of events
as found in the project files. It is thus not proposed to review them in detail
in this audit. The audit will concentrate instead on a number of selected issues
which are either of importance in themselves or which still remain contentious.

/a    All costs and credit/loan amounts are in current values.
The major problem in all four projects was keeping expenditure up to estimates.
The cost estimates themselves were for the most part reasonably accurate and cost
overruns were never a problem. The speed of implementation, however, was much
slower than appraisal forecasts. Only the Karonga II loan was fully utilized,
although a 21 month extension in the Closing Date was needed to accomplish this.
The slight cost overrun in dollar terms was a cost underrun in MK terms because
the kwacha appreciated against the dollar during implementation, with the result
that the Government contribution had to be considerably increased. In the case
of the other three projects the kwacha depreciated during implementation (from
Mk 0.83 - US$1.0 at the appraisal of NRDP I to MK 2.82 - US$1.0 during 1989).
With only about half of project costs being incurred in foreign currency, and
with a very tight budgetary situation internally, there was a continual
difficulty in maintaining project expenditures at the planned level in dollar
terms. Even to accomplish this level of disbursement the Closing Dates had to
be extended, by 33 months in the case of NRDP I and by 24 months each in the
cases of NRDP III and IV.
Physical Construction and Maintenance
3.3         Considering  the  widely  dispersed  nature  of  the  physical
infrastructure that was constructed under these four projects, the difficulties
of communications and transport, and frequently the shortages of construction
materials and budgetary resources, the physical execution of the projects was
commendable.  This is not to say that there were not many difficulties, and many
things were done later than planned, but delays and shortfalls in construction
were almost invariably the result of design inadequacies, under-estimation of



- 10 -
costs or shortages of funds. In Karonga II, for instance, only about one-third
of the planned roads were constructed because appraisal cost estimates were too
low and overspending on operating costs prevented the reallocation of funds from
other components. The construction of dipping tanks had to be abandoned for
similar reasons. Only a'bout 70 per cent of the roado envisaged under NRDP I were
constructed at a cost about two and a half times higher than appraisal estimates.
This was reportedly due to increased fuel costs, changes in original road plans
and lack of final design before appraisal.
3.4         There  is one exception to this satisfactory performance;  the
construction of new markets and input supply depots. In Karonga II none of the
9 market complexes and 8 input sheds envisaged were built. In NRDP I none of the
5 permanent markets and 7 input stores that should have been constructed were
built. In NRDP III the markets and stores were constructed but only after long
delays. In NDRP IV the appraisal target was exceeded and five market sheds were
built against the expected four.
3.5         The agency responsible for this component, in all the projects, was
the Agricultural Development and Marketing Corporation (ADMARC).  This is a
statutory company, and although under the general supervision of MOA, it is
autonomous in its day to day operations and has the full financial and
administrative independence needed for it to exercise its functions as a
commercial trading enterprise. It was established to purchase all smallholder
crops, to sell food crops and to maintain the national food reserve, and also to
sell and deliver crop production inputs (seeds, fertilizers, chemicals etc.).
ADMARC operates a nationwide network of marketing sheds and storage facilities
for these purposes.
3.6         Under the projects it was planned to intensify this network in the
project areas to cater to the increased demand for inputs and the increased
production coming to market.  ADMARC thus played a key role in the project
design. However, because it was not under the direct control of MOA, it was not
part of NRDP. Neither was it a party to the Loan/Credit agreements for any of
the projects although in the first two projects it was supposed to build the
markets/input sheds out of its own resources. This had been the arrangement in
the Lilongwe projects and it had worked satisfactorily because at that time
ADMARC was making substantial surpluses on its crop trading. This was still the
situation when Karonga II and NRDP I were approved; by the time the markets were
due for construction, however, ADMARC's financial position was deteriorating
rapidly and it was not prepared to use its resources for these markets. As a
result, by the time of NRDP III, the financing of market construction by ADMARC
was made the subject of a specific covenant in the Credit Agreement. In NRDP IV
the Government financed ADMARC's construction unit to build the facilities and
then leased them back to ADMARC to operate. This arrangement appears to have
overcome ADMARC's reluctance to participate.   This experience indicates the
difficulty of not having all project activities under a single management
structure. It might have been better if IDA had financed this component and/or
if ADMARC had been a party to the Loan/Credit Agreements. It must also be said
that ADMARC's construction program was based on its own view of the need for
markets on a national basis and it only constructed new markets where the likely



- 11 -
throughput justified it. The fact that these IDA projects were not generating
the surpluses predicted at appraisal may well have been a factor in ADMARC's
decision not to construct more markets in project areas. ADMARC's role in the
provision of inputs and marketing is discussed later.
3.7         While the experience with ADMARC strengthened those who argued in
favor of putting all project construction under the control of project
management, the experience with other components showed that the short-term gains
of such a procedure might well be outweighed by the problems of long-term
maintenance that it created. Satisfactory completion of physical infrastructure
has tended to be seen in the Bank as an index of project success. Unfortunately
this is only a partial measure. If there is inadequate provision for maintenance
it would be better not to have built the infrastructure in the first place. This
has been particularly true in respect of road construction. In the LLDP, for
instance, the project's own construction unit built all the roads. By the end
of Phase III, however, 1,800 kilometres of the 2,600 km built had not been
accepted by the Regional Engineer of the Ministry of Works and Supplies (MOW) as
they were below departmental construction standards (Phase III PCR para 7.2.1.3).
Once the project was completed maintenance of the roads built under the project
virtually ceased as the local councils were not equipped, nor could they afford,
to maintain them. A similar situation prevailed in Karonga. As early as 1981
the NRDP Review Mission found that many of these roads had returned to bush. The
audit mission found similar evidence of neglect in both Lilongwe and Raronga.
In Chitipa District, for instance, roads built under the project were virtually
unused so that, while the amount of maintenance required was not great, most of
the bridges and culverts had collapsed; they could be circumvented in dry
weather, but in the rainy season the roads were reportedly impassable. Despite
this experience, under NRDP I the road construction unit in MOA (set up during
the pre-investment phase of NRDP that was financed under Karonga II) was greatly
strengthened to allow the Ministry to continue constructing roads in NRDP areas.
It was assumed that by building roads to MOW standards the problem of future
maintenance would be overcome. However this did not come about. Under NRDP I
although all the roads were built to MOW standards (with a consequent 265 per
cent cost overrun) only 40 per cent of them were accepted by MOW at the end of
the project for future maintenance because MOW had insufficient funds to maintain
more (PCR para 3.06). The NRDP Review Mission believed that there was no great
long-term need for the Ministry to have ite own construction unit, particularly
as the unit was but little involved with maintenance, because the IDA-financed
District Roads Improvement and Maintenance Program (DRIMP) could take over this
role (para 2.05). Neither NRDP III or IV had a roads component, most of the
projects' needs for roads being met by DRIMP.
3.8         Lack of maintenance is also severely reducing the effectivenese of
the massive soil conservation works built under the three phases of LLDP (about
7,700 km of diversion ditches and 900 km of waterways).   At the time the
program's achievements were hailed as a model of successful development, but now
the audit questions what was really achieved by theee civil works. In a brief
field visit the audit mission found that in the area inspected the soil
conservation works were no longer being maintained and in some cases were hardly
even visible. That lack of maintenance of soil conservation works in Lilongwe



- 12 -
is widespread is borne out in a recent paper prepared for a World Bank mission
to Malawi on the environment.
"Physical soil conservation structures in the Lilongwe Development Project
are in poor stato based on physical evaluation, farmers' observations and
feedback from extension personnel. All these sources indicate that the
structures have a decreased carrying capacity.  Apart from field soil
conservation structures....farm ponds spillvays are badly eroded, some of
them have been seriously gullied, and the access roads have only received
minimal maintenance using a hand hoe since the project was
terminated....most of the roads in the project area are only passable in
isolated lengths, making than totally unusable....most of the farm
ponds are idle."2/
3.9         In addition to the lack of maintenance calling into question some of
the civil works built under the integrated projects, the relationship between the
agricultural and the non-agricultural components also gives rise to problems when
the implications of the non-agricultural components are not taken fully into
account.  The audit mission found, for instance, that some of the boreholes
installed under the Karonga project had not been maintained. In southern Karonga
District a water supply project financed by the Danish IDA is currently
rehabilitating existing wells and drilling new ones. The audit found that at
least 40 per cent of the wells requiring rehabilitation had been installed under
the IDA projects. A similar situation was also found in Chitipa where over half
the boreholes dug under the project are no longer functioning. In the case of
dip tanks also, the majority of these are used at best irregularly, at worst not
at all, due to lack of acaricides, of water and of pumps. This is not a new
situation. The NRDP Review also made similar remarks (para 2.01):
"The philosophy of complementarity of investments has remained, in some
cases, more an ideal than a reality. Health facilities were built but, in
some cases, particularly for health posts, not staffed or used; even if
they had been used, they often involved child care, whose benefits for
agriculture would only be realized many years later and even then, not
necessarily in the same area. Water supply was provided, but boreholes
were not maintained so that the impact of a clean water supply on
villagers' health and use of their time was uncertain."
3.10        This problem of maintenance, particularly the cost of maintaining
staff and providing adequate funds for running expenses, is examined later in
more detail in Section V.

Project Staff in  and Organization
3.11        When Malawi gained independence in 1964 the number of Malawians in
the higher levels of the civil service was negligible. There vas also relatively
little emphasis on the Africanization of administration, so that the early IRDPs
tended to be planned, and staffed at management levels, by expatriates. At lower
levels finding enough staff was always a problem and the projects contained major
provisions for staff training (including management training) to try to fill the
gap by upgrading less qualified persons. Despite this, neither of the extension
cadres in LLDP or KRDP were ever fully staffed. Even finding expatriate staff
was not easy as these were employed on government rates with none of the
topping-up  benefits  that  expatriates  expect  today.    For  instance  the
effectiveness of Karonga I was delayed for three months while a project manager
was sought and other posts remained vacant for long periods.  The difficulty of
finding Malawian staff was exacerbated by the fact that staff positions were not
in the system of civil service 'established' posts. This meant that when the
project ended the employees had no guarantee of tenure or employment rights.
3.12        The staffing implications of expanding the rural development program
countrywide were a major concern of the Bank once the concept of NRDP was
accepted. As the President's Report for Karonga II recognized, the availability
of qualified staff would be the limiting factor for the expansion of agricultural
development activities (para 27).   In the Karonga II Loan Agreement was a
covenant that, "in order to determine a feasible rate of future expansion of the
Borrower' s agricultural development activities, the Borrower shall: (i) cause
MANR to review MANR's manpower situation for the following ten years; and (ii)
discuss with the Bank the results of such a review" (Section 3.10). This report
became the basis for the staffing proposals in NRDP I.
3.13        Karonga II itself was beset by staffing problems.  At senior levels
there was a high rate of turnover, to the extent that overall implementation
suffered, and certain posts, such as the Senior Administrative Officer and Senior
Engineer, were never filled. At the junior level about 50 per cent of positions
were vacant for long periods and even by the end of the project over one-third
of the Technical Assistant and Development Assistant posts (i.e. those in direct
contact with farmers) were vacant.
3.14        The review of the manpower situation carried out under Karonga II led
to the staffing implications of NRDP I being carefully considered. For higher
level p   .ions the appraisal report said: "Every effort has been made to design
the project within the limitations of the output of newly trained Malawian and
existing expatriate staff levels within the Government".   Nevertheless some
additional expatriates were to be recruited. The rapid development of the estate
sector was absorbing many of the newly trained Malawians who had been expected
to be available to replace expatriates. At the lower levels the situation was
recognized as critical and there was heavy reliance on upgrading and retraining.
The Government also gave an assurance that further expansion of the NRDP and
other agricultural development projects would be phased in such a manner that
existing project commitments would be met before starting new ones (paras 4.11
and 4.12).



- 14 -
3.15        In the event senior level staffing remained a constraint throughout
project implementation. A number of factors were blamed for this: (i) lengthy
delays in creating and establishing new posts; (ii) delays in positioning new
staff; (iii) frequent shifting of staff, either on reasGignment or for training,
usually at short notice and without provision for replacement and (iv) a critical
scarcity of suitable staff. The result Was disruption in project implementation
due to lack of continuity and deployment of staff to positions for which they had
no experience or qualifications.   (See Supervision report for April-May 1985
Annex 5 para 5). At the lower level there was never any serious problem in
filling positions.
3.16        During the implementation of NRDP I the NRDP Review Mission again
considered the likely availability of staff for any future extension of the
program. At the senior level the Review saw the main problem as or.e of the
stability of management. Most senior officials were part of a system of "common
services" by which they were liable to inter-departmental transfer. The result
was a rapid turnover of senior management.   There were few "professional"
(technical) positions in higher grades in MOA so that competent people sought to
move into "common services" positions and thus become eligible for transfer out
of MUA. The increasing number of management positions created by NRDP were not
being filled by persons with management background but by technicians who were
expected to acquire management experience over time. Despite these problems the
Review did not believe that shortage of professional staff was a constraint to
future NRDP phases. It came to a similar conclusion about the number of field
extension workers. The number of persons capable of filling the intermediate or
supervisory level (TO) was seen as a constraint but one which could be overcome
by upgrading selected junior staff and shifting TOs from more heavily staffed
areas.8/
3.17        Despite the relative optimism of this review, NRDP III was dogged by
senior  staff  shortages  throughout  implementation.    This was  principally
attributed to the excessive demand for qualified staff generated by the aggregate
rural development efforts/projects being undertaken by the Government. These
problems were a combination of excessive delays in establishing new posts,
failure to fill key section head posts at all (e.g. Senior Planning Officer) and
frequent changes in top management.  For instance there were five different
Program Managers (the senior project position) during the project life, of which
four were in an acting capacity. The situation had not changed at the time of
the audit mission's visit.
8/    There are three levels of junior staff.  At the bottom is the Development
Assistant (DA), a non-established post. No special agricultural training
is required.  Experience is gained on the job.  Next is the Technical
Assistance (TA). This is an established post for which two years of post-
junior certificate training is required. The top is the Technical Officer
(TO) for which a three year diploma course at the agricultural college is
required.



- 15 -
3.18        Ae regards junior staff, at appraisal no new extension staff had been
envisaged as the farmersextension staff ratio, at about 350:1 was considered
satisfactory. The NRDP Review Mission's proposal that a ratio of 750:1 was more
sustainable led to pressure by IDA on the Government to reduce the number of
established posts in Karonga, but at the same time to upgrade the quality of the
staff, the majority of whom were local, untrained DAs. Some of the required
training took place but the number of established posts was not reduced, indeed
the PCR states that, because transport problems were preventing TAs and DAs from
visiting farmers, more TAs and DAs were hired, reducing the farmer:TA ratio still
further to 250:1. At the time of the audit mission, despite the shortage of
revenue budget, the number of TA posts had not been reduced and only about 10 per
cent of them were vacant.   It seems clear that junior level staffing was
excessive during and after implembr.ation of NRDP III.
3.19        Contrariwise there have been few staffing problems with NRDP IV,
although it was implemented over roughly the same time period as NRD? III, with
the exception of the rapid rate of senior staff turnover. The farmeraTA ratio
has been around 750-800:1 for most of the project life.
3.20        Whatever the reasons, the Bank clearly was overoptimistic about the
ability of the Ministry to staff the rapidly expanding NRDP and as a result
project implementation of the whole Program suffered. By way of mitigation,
however, the Bank did try hard to prevent the Government from proceeding too fast
with the Program and had some success. For instance, the early planning of NRDP
III envisaged a project with eight separate sub-projects.  Six of these were
later financed by IDA and the International Fund for Agricultural Development
(IFAD) in four separate projects spread over three years, one by bilateral
financing and one has still not yet been financed.
Agricultural Extension. Credit and Farmer CoWerae
3.21        Under the original IRDPs, extension followed what was then called a
"unit" or "scheme" approach.   In Karonga, for instance, a "scheme" was a
specially demarcated area in which the project reorganized and consolidated land
holdings with a view to implementing soil conservation works. Within each scheme
area the extension worker formed groups of farmers and encouraged them to use
modern inputs such as hybrid maize and fertilizers and provided these on credit
on an individual basis. Farmers outside the scheme areas were rarely visited by
the extension workers and to begin with did not receive inputs on credit. During
the implementation of Karonga II the scheme approach was phased out and instead,
to promote the use of modern inputs, farmer credit groups (later called Farmer
Clubs) were formed across the whole project area, on the lines originally
pioneered in LLDP. Extension workers were almost exclusively concerned with
forming these groups, arranging input supplies and recovering credit. These
activities left little time for extension of new ideas, apart from those
associated with the credit packages. The development of these Farmer Clubs was
one of the major success stories of the LLDP and the subsequent NRDPs. They
represent one of the more successful formal smallholder agricultural (seasonal)



- 16 -
credit systems among developing countries.  Their repayment record has been
outstanding, largely because if any member fails to repay all the members will
be denied access to credit in the following year.
3.22        The extension system was later modified by the adoption of what was
called the "Block Approach". This was a modification of the Training and Visit
(T and V) system which the Bank had been supporting in a number of countries,
most notably in India, as a means of providing all farmers with regular and
systematic access to extension advice. Its adoption in Malawi was an attempt to
get away from the exclusive focus on credit groups It was introduced soon after
the start of NRDP I and rapidly spread to all project areas. Under the Malawi
version of this system each project area was sub-divided into a number of
Extension Planning Areas (EPA), which were then further sub-divided into
sections. one to each TA. These were split up into 7-8 blocks of 60-120 farm
families. A demonstration plot was established in each block and the TA was
supposed to meet all the farmers in the block at the demonstration plot on a
two-weekly schedule. The key to the success of the system was the regularity of
the visiting and the ease with which it could be supervised (given adequate
mobility). The system adopted in Malawi differed from that adopted in India in
that it used the community to activate farmer interest rather than :ontact
farmers,  and  in  that  it  had  formal  demonstrations.    It  also  differed
significantly in failing to insist that the sole function of the extension worker
was to provide advice and not to become involved with credit, input supply or
other regulatory activities.
3.23        Although the new system was initially adopted enthusiastically by
farmers and extension staff it did not overcome the basic problems.   The
technical packages which the extension service had available focused on
fertilized hybrid maize monocropping  or cash crops.   These were  largely
unattractive to smallholders whose first priority was to maximize food
production.9/ Very little attention was paid to subsistence crops (i.e. local
maize, pulses, sorghum, millet, cassava) in adaptive trials on farmers' fields.
As a result, therefore the extension message was primarily of interest only to
the larger farmers with enough land both to meet their subsistence needs and grow
some crops for sale. These were also the same farmers who made up the bulk of
the Farmer Clubs which had previously been the main beneficiaries of the
extension service under the old system. It was soon found that attendance at the
block meetings was very low and mainly made up of the larger, credit-worthy
farmers. Even for these farmers, however, the impact of the extension system was
hampered by the interactive effects of insufficient price incentives, limited
credit, erratic input supplies and the low level of applied technology.
9/    Hybrid maize is regarded as a cash crop not a food crop bj the majority of
smallholders because the varieties now on offer have a comparatively soft
endosperm and are thus difficult to pound (in Malawi maize is
traditionally pounded before grinding in order to remove the outer,
fibrous layer of the seed, which requires a hard endosperm). In addition
they do not keep well under farmer level storage conditions.

3.24        In an attempt to overcome these problems  (and also because of
emerging budgetary constraints) the next area-based project, that would have been
NRDP V, was modified during preparation to concentrate on strengthening the
national extension system, particularly by supporting innovative approaches to
extension and information transfer. This became the Agricultural Extension and
Planning Support Project (part of what the MOA still calls NRDP V). This was
approved in September 1985, a little over two years after NRDP IV had commenced.
The main impact of the new project on NRDP IV was that the new approaches being
tried were also introduced into the project area. The objectives of this new
system were to move the focus of extension from the demonstration plots at the
block level onto farmers' fields, to strengthen the linkage with research and to
improve quality and relevance of in-service training of the TAs - essentially to
try to get closer to the T and V system. This was introduced from the 1988-89
season with the expectation once again that it would broaden the contact with
non-borrowing farmers. It is too early to say whether this will be achieved
but early experience indicates that the fields to which demonstrations were being
moved mostly belonged to the same Farmer Club members as before.10/
3.25        The overall experience with extension under these projects has
therefore been disappointing, despite (it ma) even be fair to say, because of)
the creation of a highly successful credit system. The number of farmers who
have had access to the extension services has been largely limited to those who
are members of Farmer Clubs. The range of advice which has been on offer has
also been of limited value. Although evaluation studies show clearly that the
yields obtained by adopters (i.e. the larger farmers) are higher than those
obtained by the non-adopters, the limited number of adopters has meant that the
overall impact of the extension system has been limited. In some cases, e.g.
livestock, the number of beneficiaries of the system has been extremely small.
The Farmer Clubs have inhibited the extension system from giving advice to the
three-quarters of the farm households that do not borrow. This appears to have
been a conscious decision. While in LLDP the original intention had been that
the coverage of the extension system would be universal, in Karonga I only about
50 per cent of the farmers in scheme areas were expected to be borrowers, while
by Karonga II the figure had fallen to 35 per cent; only about a 27 per cent
coverage was actually achieved. No further increase in membersGtp was achieved
in the next phase, although the amount of credit distributed annually increased
substantially. In NRDP IV the target of Farmer Club membership was 18 per cent.
10/   The Region comme-h:s that the new system, in attempting to move the focus
of extension from the block level to on-farm demonstrations, ls
supplementing the block level demonstration work, which tries to cover the
entire range of crop-related extension advice, not replacing it. The on-
farm demonstrations cover perhaps only one or two aspects of
recoenndations for one crop.  It was discovered that in fact in many
areas there were no block demonstrations and the on-farm ones were the
first demonstrations that extension staff had been able to organize for
some time.   As a result, it is not surprising that extension workers
should choose farmers with whom they already had contact to participate.

By the end of the project the actual membership was about 1P per cent of farm
households.
3.26        To raise the proportion of farm families having access to credit, IDA
financed a Smallholder Agricultural Credit Project in late 1987. The objective
of this project was to amalgamate Malawi's pro4e^t-based credit systems into a
national system that would be better-managed, mcre efficient, low-cost and
financially viable. It was planned to increase the proportion of farm families
receiving credit from the national average of 16 per cent in 1985/86 to 22 per
cent in 1993/94. Thus even this project did not anticipate being able to reach
many of the smaller farmers.
Input Availability and Use
3.27        In all the four projects the economic justification for project
investments was increased agricultural production, mostly maize, and mostly due
to increased yields resulting from the adoption of higher yielding varieties and
increased use of fertilizer. The extension service was to create the demand for
seed and fertilizer and ADMARC was to supply them.
3.28        The general experience of all the projects has been that the demand
for seed of improved varieties never reached expected levels, while the supply
of fertilizer was almost invariably unable to meet the demand.
3.29        The low rate of uptake of hybrid maize was noticed by Bank staff as
early as 1976 but for many years after that there was a general tendency to blame
the low rate of uptake on shortage of seed, late delivery of seed, and shortage
of fertilizer.11/  The question of its acceptability by farmere was slow to
arise. There was a period of real shortage in the mid-1970s, when the supply
from what was then Southern Rhodesia was cut off. But this imported seed was
replaced by local varieties in a few years. By the time of the NRDP I appraisal
most of the seed needs of the project were expected to be met by seed produced
in Malawi (para 5.05). By 1986/87 ADMARC production of hybrid maize exceeded
local demand, and in 1987/88 Malawi exported substantial quantities of hybrid
maize (apparently due to bureaucratic delays not lack of demand because a crash
import program was required later the same year). Thus shortage of supply was
not the reason for low rates of uptake.   There were years in Karonga when
supplies were below demand because of transportation problems, but over the seven
years ending 1988/89, when supplies were never short, hybrid maize still only
averaged just under 1OZ of the total maize area. In the original Lilongwe area,
11/   The following quote from the PCR of Lilongwe III is typical (para 5.5):
"Due to the lower than anticipated uptake of improved maize seed and a
change in relative farm-gate prices of smallholder crops, incremental
maize production was lower than projected at appraisal. However, had the
marketing system provided fertilizers and improved seeds in the quantities
projected  and  ordered  by  management,  it  is  likely  that  maize
production....would have considerably exceeded appraisal targets."

which had the longest history of extension in Malawi, the proportion of hybrid
maize in 1988/89 was also still only 10 per cent, and in the two sub-project
areas of NRDP IV it was 10 per cent in Lilongwe North East and 5 per cent in
Dedza Hills. (Nationally the area under hybrid maize was fluctuating around 3-5
per cent of the total maize area.)
3.30        The 1988 Technical Issues Review of the NRDP 12/ also looked at
other possible reasons for low uptake of hybrid maize.  It found that there was
no evident correlation between the use of hybrid seed and the availability of
credit as an explanation of the low rate of uptake.  Government figures for
1986/87 showed that the number of bags of hybrid maize seed taken on credit was
only 27 per cent of the number of borrowers and that, given the number who took
more than one bag, the proportion of borrowers using hybrid maize was probably
less than 25 percent. The figures for Karonga ADD showed that only 10 per cent
of borrowers were using hybrid maize seed, and in Lilongwe ADD 18 per cent.
Other evidence also indicated that it was not lack of fertilizer that discouraged
hybrid seed use. Just over half the fertilizer used in the smallholder sector
was going on local maize and only 28 per cent on hybrid maize.  The Review
concluded that the commonly held view, that it was the keeping and pounding
qualities of hybrid maize that kept farmers from using it, was almost certainly
correct.  Thus the problem of low adoption rates found in the projects under
audit was not a project related one. It required dealing with at the national
level. This is referred to again in paragraphs below on research.
3.31        The growth in the consumption of fertilizer was, as with hybrid maize
seed, much below appraisal expectations. This was not, however, the result of
lack of demand but of fertilizer shortages. These shortages should have been
anticipated at the time of appraisal; perhaps not in the first two projects but
by the time of the appraisal of NRDP III they were readily apparent. Growth of
fertilizer demand nationally was growing faster than the country could afford to
import and the Bank projects were not protected from the national shortages.
3.32        The disappointing rate of fertilizer uptake in all the NRDP projects,
however, was not due to lack of demand. It seems highly likely that one of the
major success stories of the extension services was in promoting increased demand
for fertilizer, ironically perhaps not on the main crop intended, hybrid maize,
and not always by those with whom the extension service was in direct contact.
Nationally, the growth in fertilizer demand over the past 12 years or so has been

remarkable.13/ At least part of the reason for this growth is the 'leakage',
i.e. cash sales, of subsidized smallholder fertilizer to the estate sector where
it is not subsidized, and the widespread illegal cultivation of burley tobacco,
with its heavy requirement of fertilizer, by smallholders.  The size of the
leakage is estimated at anything up to one-third of smallholder purchases (see
also OED's recent Audit of the Smallholder Fertilizer project). The extent of
the diversion to illegal burley tobacco cultivation can be judged by the
situation in Rasungu RDP where credit repayments (for fertilizer) plummeted,
after late rains in 1988 virtually destroyed the burley tobacco crop, from its
customary level of over 90 per cent to 48 per cent in 1988/89. This was not
because the maize crop failed but because their receipts from burley, on which
the farmers had put the fertilizer, were too small to repay the loans.  The
demand for hybrid seed and fertilizer was also highly correlated with the
fertilizersmaize price ratio, ADMARC's maize buying performance and the relative
returns from maize and groundnuts.  Between 1985/86 and 1986/87 the relative
price moved in favor of groundnuts and ADHARC was unable to purchase hybrid
maize, meaning that many farmers had to take hybrid maize home and then had
storage problems. Consequently many farmers switched to groundnuts as a cash
crop with dramatic consequences for hybrid maize production, and the demand for
maize seed.
3.33        In the PCRs of the early projects ADNARC was blamed for late delivery
of fertilizer without looking behind the reasons for this. The PPAR on Lilongwe
111, written in late 1980, concluded this was unfair on ADMARC: "Although ADMARC
could substantially improve its present practices, a major share of its
ineffectiveness in serving the program could be attributed to factors outside the
ADMARC management. Such factors include delays at foreign ports of entry for
imported goods, supply controls imposed nationally, disturbances in the local
transport system due to political events in neighboring countrles, and
inefficient planning by program management" (para 20). The PPAR blamed the Bank
for not foreseeing these problems and incorporating flexibility into project
design. Certainly the design of Raronga II (approved 6/76) takes no account of
possible constraints in fertilizer supply despite problems encountered in the
first phase, merely mentioning that incremental fertilizer consumption would only
be 1,225 tons.   Late delivery nevertheless  remained a problem throughout
implementation and in several years was blamed for poor crop production. Neither
did the appraisal report of NRCP I (dated 11/78) anticipate fertilizer supply
problems although by then ADMARC's financial problems should have been apparent.
And even the appraisal report of NRDP III still did not mention the fertilizer
supply problem although it was written in September 1981, well after the emerging
fertilizer crisis should have become apparent and despite the Government's
financial problems having given rise to the first SAL. Yet two months later the
13/   Smallholder fertilizer consumption grew from 10,500 nutrient tons in
1977/78 to 36,000 nutrient tons iu 1988/89, equivalent to an annual growth
rate of 12 per cent. See also, OED's recent PPAR of Malawi Smallholder
Fertilizer Project.



- 21 -
supervision report of NRDP I found that only one quarter of the season's
fertilizer supplies had arrived.
3.34        The fertilizer supply problems were the combined result of Malawi's
deteriorating external transport links, foreign exchange constraints and ADMARC's
own financial problems.  They could not be solved within the context of any
area-based  project.    The Government,  IDA  and IFAD  therefore prepared  a
Smallholder Fertilizer ?roject (Cr. 1352-MAI, approved 04/83 and IAD Loan 120-MW
and Grant 109-MW) to deal directly with the fertilizer supply problems, in
particular to provide finance for fertilizer purchase, to improve ADMARC's
procedures for procuring and distributing fertilizers and to strengthen NOA's and
ADMARC's institutional capacity.   It also involved a number of other policy
related measures, in particular those related to fertilizer pricing, which are
addressed in the recent audit of the Smallholder Fertilizer Project.   The
Smallholder Fertilizer Project was successful in supplying the amounts of
fertilizer estimated to be needed at the time of appraisal.14/  However the
project failed to solve ADMARC's internal distribution problems, in terms of
meeting individual area's needs in a timely manner. Thus the projects under
auicit through this period, NRDPs I, III and IV, all coittinued to suffer from
fertilizer sbortages from time to time; for instance, in NRDP III only 30 per
cent of estimated fertilizer needs were met in time in 1982/83 and in NRDP IV
fertilizer consumption fell two years running, in 1985/86 and 1986/87 due to
supply problems and the demand reduction outlined in paras. 3-5-3.6 above.
Project impact has been constrained as a result. The shortages in NRDP III were
particularly acute because of the inadequacy of the transportation links to
Karonga.
OutDut Marketina
3.35        All the projects also relied on ADMARC for output marketing.  ADMARC
had the statutory power to purchase all smallholder export crops and also all
crops grown on customary land, principally maize.   For maize ADMARC was the
residual buyer, purchasing only such amounts as farmers chose to sell to it.
Significant amounts of smallholder produce were sold to private traders or
bartered among farmers themselves. There also appears to have been a thriving
cross-border trade using tiaditional marketiag ties with neighboring Zambia,
Tanzania and Mozambique. This is reported to have stopped in the early 1980s
14/   All the available evidence indicates that the smallholder fertilizer
market nationally has not been saturated during the 1980s and that more
would have been used if it had been available, especially given the
subsidized price at which it was sold.  See PCR Smallholder Fertilizer
Pro;ect, Report No. 8534 of April 1990, para 30; NRDP Technical Issues
Review (op. cit.); Sahn, David E. and Arulpragasm, Jehan "The Stagnation
of Smallholder Agriculture in Malawi: A Decade of Structural Adjustment",

when relative prices moved in favor of Malawi. No attempt was made to support
this parallel market, a fact which the PCR on Karonga II regretted, believing
that this would have had much greater impact than "the ineffectual attempts to
improve ADMARC's performance".   Although all the PCRs criticize ADMARC's
performance in purchasing project output, this criticism is muted because the
incremental production achieved was always less than anticipated - a common
finding in audits of many Bank rural development projects.
3.36        As far as internal marketing was concerned, therefore, ADMARC was an
effectivo monopsony.  It was not until the SAL process opened up the possibility
of introducing policy change on a wider sectoral basis that the Bank was able to
get the Government to end this monopsony. Under SAL II the private sector was
encouraged to enter into marketing at its discretion, with ADMARC's role being
to provide a price support system as buyer of last resort at prices announced
before planting. Too short a time has elapsed to judge if this had any impact
on NRDP IV, but preliminary indications are that it is minimal and credit for
private sector marketing has, so far, attracted little demand.
3.37        On the other hand, another of the marketing changes introduced under
SAL II had an immediate and deleterious Impact on NRDP IV - this was the closing
of a number of ADMARC's seasonal buying points and input distribution centers in
order to reduce costs. This had the effect of increasing the distance over which
farmers had to carry purchased inputs, in turn greatly increasing the amount of
fertilizer bought on credit, because ADMARC took responsibility for delivering
fertilizer bought on credit, while farmers who bought for cash had to arrange
their own delivery.
3.38        Output marketing is thus another area where the Bank was unable to
introduce changes which it thought desirable through area-based project
financing, but had to wait until a more appropriate mechanism was available.
Research
3.39        Research was still another component of the IRDPs and NRDP which
proved in the end to be more suitably tackled under a national project than under
a series of area-based projects. This is not unique to Malawi. Bank experience
in other countries has been similar.15/  Typically, the early IRDP projects
in Malawi had a Research and Trials component under which crop trials in farmers'
gardens to demonstrate recommended improved techniques were to be conducted. In
practice these components tended to be understaffed and to lack project specific
direction for the trials, so that what research they did do was usually designed
only to fit within the national varietal trials program.   This situation
continued right through the implementation of NRDP I. Even as late as June 1985
a supervision mission of that project was commenting that: "trials program has
had hardly any impact in improving extension messages, mainly because the trial

project in India. OED Report No. 8808, June 29, 1990.



- 23 -
program was not oriented towards coming up with practical solutions for problems
ider.tified by field extension staff."  There are similar comments on NRDP IV at
the same period.
3.40        Part of the inadequacy of the whole approach to research was the
basic assumption that a suitable technical package was available to permit
smallholders to increase their maize and groundnut yields; it was not until the
early 1980s that this assumption began to be fundamentally questioned.l6/ At
the same time it was recognized that the research system did need strengthening.
As a result, under NRDP I, one of the bilateral co-financiers, USAID, funded a
project to strengthen the research department. FoAlowing this, the Bank's NRDP
Review Mission recommended in 1982 that the International Service for National
Agricultural Research (ISNAR) should review how to restructure the research
department in order to focus more effort on verification trials and smallholders'
particular constraints.   This led to a free-standing, IDA-financed National
Agricultural Research Project (HARP, Cr. 1549-MAI of 02/85), paralleled by
another USAID-financed Malawi Agricultural Research and Extension Project (these
two projects, together with the Agricultural Extension and Planning Support
Project are known in Malawi as NARP V).  Besides strengthening the national
research system in various ways, these projects aimed to create better linkages
between research and extension with the aim of making research responsive to
farmers' needs. In particular adaptive research teams were established in each
ADD under NARP. They were to combine research and extension staff in a program
of  farming  systems  research  and  problem-solving  on-farm  trials  and
demonstrations.   The objective was to produce locally-specific production
recommendations. The results have so far been disappointing but as many of the
staff have only recently returned from overseas fellowships, it is too soon to
judge. This seems the most hopeful approach and needs to be persevered with.
3.41        As a result of these changes the research approach of the NRDP
projects was modified. An adaptive research team began work in Karonga in late
1986, the last year of project implementation. No recommendations were available
before the project closed. The work has continued since. The research component
in NRDP IV was similarly modified to become part of the national adaptive
research program.
16/   The Region comments "that there are many, including some staff of the
International Food Policy Research Institute, who are convinced that
available maize technology is very suitable for Malawi, but that there are
gaps that need attention maybe in the area of storage or processing. That
is exactly what the Malawi Research and Extension Services were feeling
and that is why they persisted trying to hard to make a breakthrough with
that technology. The evidence is not all in yet and maybe the present
approach may not be more profitable than earlier efforts. We feel that
trying to meet consumers' requirements for the maize crop (or any other
crop) is worth trying, just as those before us thought that existing
varieties were adequate. There are still quite strong views that it is
wrong to perpetuate the wasteful habit of 'maize pounding and seed skin
removal' - and that the HYV flint development program is a mistake."

Land Registration
3.42        One of the main reasons for including the 'consolidation' phase of
Lilongwe in NRDP I was to allow the land registration component, begun in LLDP
Phase I in 1968, to be completed. This component had originally been included
because it was believed that the traditional form of 'customary' land tenure,
whereby tenants were allocated land by the village chief, was preventing farmers
from improving the land they cultivated anti was leading to erosion, as population
pressure was forcing farmers to cultivate marginal lands. It was also proposed
to reduce land fragmentation by consolidating holdings. A similar program in
Kenya had been highly successful as it allowed smallholders to have big enough
plots to grow coffee.   Unfortunately there was no such crop in Lilongwe to
provide a similar stimulus.
3.43        Under the registration program  lands had to be surveyed,  and
customary use established before the title to the land was registered in the
family name.  This had proved to be a much more time consuming process than
originally envisaged. Dv- to lack of transport and staff shortages it was not
even finished under NRDP i and the program was handed over to the Department of
Lands and Valuation in 1984 for completion.
3.44        The registration program was the first of its kind in Malawi and has
not been replicated in any of the other NRDP areas. The Evaluation Sectiou of
LADD conducted a survey in 1983 to assess the effectiveness of the program and
whether it should be continued and introduced into other ADDs. The study was
inconclusive in this respect since it did not investigate the comparative
productivity or investment levels on registered and unregistered farms. It found
that farmers with registered land had a sense of possession and better control
of land use. Registration was said to have influenced the way land disputes were
settled. The study implied that the potential impact of registration required
a number of further complementary institutional measures before it would be
realized (such as long-term credit facilities where land could be used as
collateral and the development of a market in land). A further study by the
Bankl7/ concluded that, as a result of population pressures, the customary
authorities were losing their ability to control land use, and the security of
possession formerly found in tenure under customary law was being undermined.
It recommended that the customary tenure systems which govern smallholders should
be re-examined in order to see if they could provide adequate security cf tenure
and encourage land conservation or whether they should be modified to provide
greater security of tenure and promote productivity. The Lilongwe experiment in
registering family title to land would be the place to study for this purpose.
Nothing has come of this as yet. The audit mission discussed with a number of
farmers what impact registration had on their agricultural practices.  There
seemed to be none. A market in land has not developed and when the registered
owner dies the heirs arrange among themselves how it will be sub-divided. The
register itself is not amended.   Another problem seems to be that the land

registration was in the name of males while in this matrilineal society
inheritance is through the female heir.
3.45        It oeems unfortunate that a program wit" so much potential impact,
that was implemented with such a major effort, (it even required a change of
legislation), should have been allowed to lose momentum without even any thorough
assessment of what it has or has not accomplished.
Soil Conservation
3.46        Official concern with soil conservation has a long history going well
back before Independence. This concern has grown since as rapidly increasing
population pressure forced farmers to cultivate ever steeper slopes and more
easily erodible poorer soils. Soil conservation, along with watershed management
and afforestation, was highlighted for special attention under NRDP.
3.47        Th4.s concern was  also  shared by  the Bank.    The major  soil
conservation program of LLDP has already been discussed. All subsequent area
development projects have also included soil conservation components, though none
on  the  scale  of  Lilongwe.    The  general  experience  of  these  has  been
disappointing. They were unambitious in objectives, certainly compared with the
scale of the problem, and tended to be given a low priority in implementation
with one notable exception. The government spent its erosion control efforts in
popularizing the ridge and furrow cultivation technique remarkably successfully.
The almost universal adoption of ridge and furrow cultivation is a unique feature
of Malawi's agriculture. There are few other countries where it is so widely
adopted.   There are some flaws in the system, particularly that ridges and
furrows are not properly on the contour and on the steeper slopes, now being
encroached on, it is not fully adequate. Nevertheless the system's wide adoption
is a credit to the conservation service.
3.48        In Karonga II soil conservation consisted of continuing the work
begun under the first phase project - assisting farmers with the layout or
realignment of water control bunds in the rainfed rice areas and the construction
of minor conservation works; in addition the layout of farms based on catchments
was to be started. In the first phase the actual conservation works that had
been planned were never constructed because of staff involvement on other aspects
of greater concern. Nor were any constructed in the second phase because of lack
of funds and transport. Only one-quarter of the conservation layout planned on
catchments was achieved. This part of the project thus achieved little.
3.49        During implementation it was decided to carry out land resource
surveys in order to assist future planning. While these were carried out they
were not used by project staff as the staff who had carried out the surveys were
transferred and the new staff never became familiar with the results (Supervision
report 02/03/81, annex 6). The surveys were used, however, to plan Phase III.
In this phase funds were provided to establish seven forest reserves, coverirg
nearly one per cent of the project area, where the land and vegetation were
being, or would soon be, threatened by overuse or misuse. This program ran into



- 26 -
difficulties because of slow implementation, the result of lack of interest by
project management which gave low priority to forestry development (Supervision
report of 10/26/84 annex 2 para 13). The slow implementation meant that by the
time the project closed less than half the intended area had been surveyed and
mapped and much of the rest had been taken over by farmers for cultivation. The
audit mission was informed that in the areas that had been protected the results
were encouraging.
3.50        The need for soil conservation in NRDP IV was greater because the
project area contained a large proportion of steeply sloping land that was not
suitable for cultivation but, because of population pressure, was being farmed.
It was recognized that it would be irresponsible to initiate a project with the
objective of intensifying crop production without a comprehensive land husbandry
input (Appraisal Aide-Memoire). The project therefore included specialist land
husbandry staff at the EPA level for the first time. The emphasis of their work
was to be on biological rather than physical conservation measures, such as
establishing perennial crops on steep slopes and introducing restorative cropping
breaks of legumes and grasses. This proved difficult in an area where most of
the farms were not even big enough to provide the farmers with subsistence.
During implementation the program was short-staffed and the results were too
small to have any significant impact on the erosion problem.  Despite these
shortcomings NRDP has established quite a strong cadre of 'land husbandry'
workers and land husbandry training facilities. It has yet to be determined how
best to use them to carry out large scale soil conservation.
Burley Tobacco
3.51        Burley tobacco is a high value cash crop which is grown on estates
under a tenant system. Smallholders have till recently been forbidden by law to
grow it in order to maintain quality and restrict the quantity grown because of
a limited market. It has long been proposed that this restriction should be
raised in order to allow smallholders access to a high value cash crop. Thus in
NRDP III a pilot burley tobacco scheme was included. An area of just over 200
ha was to be developed and allotted to 50 farmers who were to grow between 0.4
and 0.8 hectare of tobacco on a four year rotation. They would be provided with
credit for inputs and raw materials and technical advice.
3.52        This was perhaps the most successful of all NRDP III's components.
By project completion yields were averaging 2200 kg/ha against the appraisal
estimate of 800 kg and the average income from tobacco for the 50 farmers was MK
4390 from 0.6 hectare of tobacco against the appraisal estimate of MK 464 (MK
1200 in 1988 prices) from 1.0 hectare of tobacco. The highest individual income
of the 50 farmers was MK 8924. With the average per capita being only about MK
350 at that time it was clear that burley tobacco was a highly profitable crop
and one that could provide smallholders with a useful income supplement.
3.53        The usefulness of this component, however, is questionable since it
is not replicable. For one thing, the selected farmers were hardly typical of
the average smallholder. At the end of the 1990 season 44 of them 'graduated'
and etarted their own estates. For another it only provided training to a very



- 27 -
limited number of farmers; most of the 44 graduates had been on the scheme for
four or five years. The area they cultivated (on average 0.6 hectare) was also
much in excess of what a smallholder would be allowed (nearer 0.1 hectare).
Nevertheless there has been a change of national policy and in 1990/91
smallholders are being licensed in Chitipa (and other parts of Malawi) for the
first time to grow burley tobacco. The District has been given a license for 26
tons, to be divided between 1,300 smallholder growers.   To the extent this
project component can take any of the credit for this change in policy it was a
worthwhile undertaking.
Monitoring and Evaluation
3.54        All four projects had provision for strong Monitoring and Evaluation
(M & E) units. These suffered badly from staff shortages, particularly at the
senior level.  A very considerable body of data was collected.   Its value,
however, has oiten been limited due to lack of analytical capability. Some use
was made of it at the time it was collected for monitoring purposes but all the
PCRs comment that unreliability of data has prevented aidequate analysis of
project impact. A considerable number of surveys were carried out that provided
project and Bank staff with better insights into farmers' attitudes and project
problems. Recent monitoring studies of NRDP IV have been of noticeably high
quality.
3.55        Support was provided under NRDP III to the National Statistical
Office to extend the coverage of annual agricultural surveys carried out in RDP
areas to non-RDP areas, and to clear up data collected under previous surveys in
project areas. This was successfully completed. As a result Malawi has one of
the best data bases in sub-Saharan Africa.
IV. PROJECT IMPACT
4.1         This section examines four different aspects of the projects' impact.
The first aspect is the impact on Malawi in economic terms. The second impact
examined is that on the direct beneficiaries, particularly the distribution of
benefits, to see how far the projects met the Bank's criteria of rural
development and how far they met the Government's policy of improving income
distribution.   The third aspect examined is the non-quantifiable benefits,
particularly the projects' impact on human resources and institutions.   The
fourth aspect is a reverse impact, the effect on the projects of the external
events that were occurring as they were being implemented, particularly the
effect of national price policies on production.
Macro-economic Imgact
4.2         The customary method used in the Bank of assessing the economic
impact of a project is to calculate its Econcmic Rate of Return (ERR). This has
been done exhaustively for the projects under review ex ante in the appraisal
reports and ex post in Project Completion Reports (PCRs) and Project Performance



- 28 -
Audit Reviews (PPARs). The evidence of all these reports is presented at some
length in Annex I. The Annex shows that, while the anticipated ex ante ERs are
all, as one would have expected, reasonably optimistic about the likely projects'
impact, the ex post ERRs provide a wide and contradictory range of estimated
outcomes even for the same project, from those showing high economic rates of
return to those indicating the investments had a negative rate of return.
4.3         This audit concludes from the evidence presented in Annex I that the
ex post evaluations of the rural development projects in Malawi do not provide
any conclusive evidence either way that the projects' investments were
worthwhile,  mn an economic sense.   The retAsons for this conclusion are as
follows: (i) primarily, the accuracy of the data base is subject to such a wide
margin of error, statist4Hal and otherwise, that widely differing ERRs can be
obtained depending on which set of data is selected; (ii) the production
increases anticipated under the projects are often so low that even with an
accurate data base the anticipated increases would be within the sampling error
of the observations.   For instance in NRDP IV the production increases
anticipated in Lilongwe North-East in the appraisal were 8 per cent for maize,
3 per cent for groundnuts and 50 per cent for tobacco. While a 50 per cent
increase in tobacco should be easily evident, the increases in the other two
crops are too small to measure. It is perfectly legitimate to show ex ante that
such small increases would provide an adequate economic justification for the
proposed investment but unreasonable to assess ex post whether they have been met
(unless there is obviously a very substantial increase); (iv) problems of
deciding ex post what is the appropriate baseline production from which to
calculate incremental production under the project are much in evidence; apart
from data base problems, even if one had accurate figures, there are all the
problems of deciding how to cope with exogenous distorting factors in pre-project
production such as weather, changes in crop prices and past trends; (v) policy
changes during project implementation are frequently found to have a much more
profound affect on production during (and after) project implementation than the
project interventions themselves. It thus becomes impossible to decide on how
to attribute changes to which cause; numerous examples can be cited in the
projects under audit of producer crop price changes which markedly altered the
crop mix and increased the production of crops which featured in the ERR
calculations but decreased the production of those that were outside the
calculations and vice versa, for instance maize and cassava in Karonga; (vi)
weather induced changes in production are also substantial and can greatly affect
an ex post ERR depending on when they occur during a project's life; (vii) the
ERRs only attempt to measure the economic impact of the crop Droduction
components and do not take into account any of the other productive components
because of lack of data; still less do they take account of the other components
with non-quantifiable benefits (e.g. health). The result is the need to make
some arbitrary assumptions about how to allocate costs between those that are
crop-related and those to exclude from the calculations. For all these reasons
this audit has not attempted to calculate any mo-e ERRs and ignores those that
have been calculated elsewhere.
4.4         An alternative to the ERR as a measure of project impact, which is
feasible in the case of the Malawi RDPs, though it would not be for many projects

elsewhere,, is to analyze the extent to which the means to attaining the
anticipated project impact have been achieved. In the case of the projects being
analyses here the means to attaining greater crop production were the increased
use of hybrid maize and fertilizers this increased use was to be brought about
by the creation of an extension service to teach farmers why and how to use
hybrid maize and fertilizer, the provision of credit to enable farmers to buy
them, and the provision of an input supply system to make them available on
time in the quantities demanded. The establishment of the extension system and
the input supply system were discussed in Section II. How successful were they
in achieving their objectives of increasing the use of hybrid maize and
fertilizer?
4.5         In the Phase I of the Lilongwe Program it had been assumed that five
years exposure to extension campaigns would induce 90 per cent of farmers to use
improved seed and 80 per cent to improve their cultivation methods.   The
expansion of fertilizer use was expected to grow more slowly and only 45 per
cent of the maize crop was expected to receive fertilizer by the twelfth year
after the project started.   Once implementation started it quickly became
apparent that these estimates were over-optimistic. A study carried out in
1970/71 and 1971/72 showed only 21 per cent of farmers using improved maize
varieties in 1970/71 and 27 per cent in 1971/72. The respective figures for
fertilizer use on maize were 16 per cent and 26 per cent.l8/   This study
showed there was strong evidence of a positive impact on crop yields of extension
service visits through increasing the use of improved seeds and fertilizer via
credit. It also showed that extension staff were concentrating their efforts on
the relatively larger holdings and on holdings where the farmer was a credit
recipient. Farmers with less than 0.4 hectare were not eligible for credit and
were rarely visited by the extension service and consequently did not use hybrid
maize seed or fertilizer.
4.6         During Phases II and III, as the size of the project area grew, the
proportion of farmers using improved seed declined, falling to an average of 8
per cent in 1977/78 and 1978/79 (by which time the whole area had been covered
by the Program).  The proportion using fertilizers on maize fluctuated with
fertilizer availability but 4as between 25 and 30 per cent in these same two
years. The uptake of hybrid maize in Phase III was only 30 per cent of that
anticipated, while the uptake of fertilizer was over 90 per cent of the original
anticipation. It was suspected at the time that this discrepancy between the
growth in the use of hybrid seed and of fertilizer was the result of smallholders
selling the subsidized fertilizer to larger farmers at a profit. This may have
been and may still be true but from later evidence the use of fertilizer on local

maize also seems to have been growing although this idea received little credence
at the time.19/
4.7         During the consolidation phase the proportion of the maize area sown
to hybrids was expected at appraisal to increase from 8 per cent at the end of
Phase III to around 18 per cent. Instead it fluctuated from year to year, as it
has done since, but only around the 5-10 per cent level (8 per cent in 1989/90).
There has as yet been no sign of a breakthrough to the higher proportions
anticipated, and on which the project benefits were based.   Similarly with
fertilizer; the appraisal report expected an increase of 50 per cent in
fertilizer consumption, to be used on the additional area of hybrid maize, the
actual increase was only about half this.20/
4.8         This evidence about the use of hybrid maize seed and fertilizer
indicates that, assuming the response rates to hybrid seed and fertilizer are
more or less correct, the production increases anticipated at appraisal for all
phases of LLDP cannot have been achieved as the result of interventions by the
projects and that most of such increases as were achieved must have been the
result of non-project causes. The available data on crop production and yields
are presented and analyzed in Annex II. These show that, while there have been
considerable increases in maize production in the LLDP area during project
implementation, tfare was no significant increase in maize yields over the
16-year period ending 1984/85. Data for the last four years indicate that maize
yields may at last be increasing. The data for Rroundnuts for the 20 years
ending 1988/89 show a 2.6 per cent per annum decrease in yields. There are no
comparable figures for tobacco. In terms of increasing agricultural productivity
therefore LLDP must be rated a failure.21/
19/   Even as late as 1981 the Bank's review of the PCR of LLDP III remarks that
'it is unlikely that farmers applied fertilizer to their local maize".
20/  The  fertilizer  figures  for  this  phase  from different  sources  are
contradictory. Consumption in year 1 (1978/79) is given as 10,223 tons in
the PCR of Phase III (p.115) and 3,467 tons in the PCR of NRDP I (page 21;
this does not seem to be nutrient tons as the 'expected' tonnage looks to
be gross). The final supervision report says fertilizer consumption for
the whole project increased by 4,293 tons 'which was lower than appraisal
estimates'. See also, OED's recent audit of Malawi Smallholder Fertilizer
Project.
21/   There is nothing new in this finding.  In discussing the same issue OED's
1984 Report No. 5387, Aaricultural Sector Operations Review: Burkina and
Malawi quotes evidence from Kydd's Measuring Peasant Differentiation for
Policy Purposes: A Report on...the Lilonawe Land Development Proaram...,
Zomba, Government Printer 1982,to the effect that between 1969/70 and
1978/79 in the oldest areas of LLDP there was (i) no growth in mean real
cash income per adult, and so no change in per capita purchasing power;
(ii) no change in per capita food production, and so unchanged nutritional

4.9         An analysis of the Raronga Program on these lines shows a similar
pattern.   In the Phase I project, when the major crop was rice, the main
indicator of increased input use was the uptake of credit, which the PCR
described as "included in the Project to encourage and facilitate use of inputs".
As the growth of credit fell below appraisal estimates it was assumed in the PCR
that the growth of fertilizer use would also have fallen below estimates
although, because some farmers purchased inputs for cash, (ADMARC's records were
inadequate to show how much) it was impossible to assess the extent of the
shortfall.
4.10        In the Phase II project the uptake of improved rice seed was double
the appraisal estimate but this was more a reflection of the fact that farmers
sold most of their crop each year and had to buy new seed, which they could get
on credit, than of any upgrading of quality. The uptake of hybrid maize was only
about 55 per cent of estimate. The uptake of improved groundnut seed was only
15 per cent of estimate. Incremental fertilizer consumption also fell short of
estimate, only 46 per cent of the expected amount being obtained on credit, with
about another 10 per cent being bought for cash. This shortfall was the result
of supply constraints.
4.11        The actual input use in Phase III was much closer to the estimate
than in earlier phases because the targets of incremental area had been scaled
back; only 10 per cent of the maize area, for instance was expected to be under
hybrids and/or composites. As a result rice seed consumption was only 20 per
cent below estimate, maize seed consumption was 13 per cent above; groundnut seed
consumption, however, was only one-quarter of estimate. On the other hand,
fertilizer targets, as appraised, were actually exceeded during the four years
of the original project life.  During the two-year extension in 1985/86 and
1986/87 fertilizer consumption fell sharply as a result of supply difficulties.
Project demand for fertilizer even exceeded appraisal estimates in some years but
ADMARC'8 supplies fell short of this demand.
4.12        The resultant total production figurea for the whole Karonga Program
are presented in Annex II. These show that there was a steady increase in rice
production from the start of Phase I implementation until the end of Phase II
after which it levelled out. This was only partly the result of area increase.
Rice yields increased at an average annual rate of 2.8 per cent over the fifteen
years ending 1988/89.  The increase in yields was concentrated in the early
project years. During the ten years ending 1988/89 yields have not increased.
How much of this increase was due to the project and how much to a favorable
price level is unclear.   The picture for maize is different.   There is no
apparent increase in maize production and maize yields declined, by 1.3 per cent
welfare levels; (iii) no change in the amount of labor given to improved
varieties of maize, the central element of the agricultural package; and
(iv) a smaller share of own holding agricultural income in total income,
representing a movement especially of males off their own farms into urban
or estate agricultural wage labor. (para 3.30)

per annum in Karonga District and 3.0 per cent in Chitipa District, although
annual yield variations were so large that the trend was not significantly
different from zero. Yield trends for groundnut were similarly not significantly
different from zero. Thus the Karonga Program can be rated a failure from the
point of view of increasing agricultural productivity, except in the case of
rice.
4.13        Although it does not come out from these evaluation figures there was
a marked increase in maize marketing in Chitipa District during the
implementation of the projects. ADMARC had only been buying maize in Chitipa in
limited quantities before the project started there, a few hundred tons annually,
since it was a remote area and transport costs to a consumption area were very
costly. By the end of Phase II ADMARC was buying over 4000 tons annually and by
the end of Phase III this had topped 6000 tons in a good year. These figures
throw considerable doubts on the accuracy of the production estimates, which also
include some 8000 tons annually from Karonga District during Phase III since they
would imply a reduction in consumption in Chitipa.   On the other hand the
increased marketing within Malawi could equally well reflect a reduction in the
cross-border trade.
4.14        A very similar result is also found in NRDP IV with its two
sub-project areas, Lilongwe North-East (LNE) and Dedza Hills (DH). To attain the
crop production targets it was estimated at appraisal that an additional 65 tons
of maize seed would be needed in LNE and 100 tons in DR. By project completion
the tonnage being used in both LNE and DH was actually less than before the
project started.  In addition 370 nutrient tons of additional fertilizer was
est'.mated to be needed to meet production targets in LNE and 510 ton- in DH.
This target was met in LNE in the second project year. For the next tU3 years
fertilizer consumption declined, returning in the last two project years to about
the 1984/85 level again. Given adequate supplies fertilizer consumption would
have been much higher. In DR fertilizer consumption never increased as planned.
4.15        In both sub-project areas maize was the main crop, accounting for 63
per cent of expected benefits at full development in LNE and 90 per cent in DH.
In LEE tobacco was the other important crop, accounting for just over 30 per cent
of expected benefits. Groundnuts, which had not been an important crop before
the project, grew rapidly in both sub-project areas in response to favorable
prices during implementation.
4.16        The data on production and yields are presented in Annex II.  These
show a considerable increase in maize production in Lilongwe North-East though
without much increase in yields, while in Dedza Hills, after a rapid increase in
production in the early project years, it fell back to around pre-project levels
later; maize yields decreased.  There was a large and unexpected increase in
groundnut production in both areas up to 1987/88, when a drought hit the 1988/89
crop very badly with a knock-on effect in 1989/90 due to lack of seed. This
increase was largely the result of favorable prices. Nevertheless the project,
by providing seeds and fertilizer on credit, undoubtedly enabled farmers to take
better advantage of the favorable prices than they could have done without it.
Groundnut yields also appear to have increased significantly until hit by



- 33 -
drought. The production of tobacco increased fast in the early project years
but then came up against quota problems that prevented further increases. Lack
of data prevents analysis of minor crops. Overall the production impact of NRDP
IV fell short of expectations, largely as a result of factors outside the control
of the project.
4.17        This examination of the extent to which the means to bring about
production increases in the various projects were actually adopted indicates
that, for the most part, farmers did not adopt hybrid maize cultivation as
anticipated, h'ut that fertilizer demand was stimulated by the extension services
to a much grt ater extent than could be supplied.  Although there have been
production increases in the projects, these have been much less than forecast at
appraisal.
4.18        An analysis of the Annual Survey of Agriculture data carried out
under NRDP III, comparing project and non-project areas, also came to a similar
conclusion about the impact of these area development projects, to the effect
that the statistical evidence was unable to prove that their production impact
was significantly different from zero.
Distributional Impact
4.19        As was explained earlier, it was quickly realized that the original
intention of the Lilongwe Program, to have 80-90 per cent of farmers adopting
improved cultivation methods and hybrid seeds within five years, was too
optimistic. Even with the heavily staffed extension service only about 70 per
cent of farmers were being reached (compared with perhaps 20 per cent outside the
project area). (Kinsey op.cit. para 57)22/  The introduction of the credit
system in LLDP tended to increase the proportion of farmers not receiving
benefits (including extension visits) from the project, since all farmers with
less than 0.4 hectare were rated as non-creditworthy. The number of extension
visits and the use of seasonal credit were strongly correlated with the adoption
of improved practices and these in turn with higher crop yields. The number of
visits was also significantly correlated with farm size; extension workers
visited the larger holdings more often. Thus the pattern of a limited proportion
of farmers being project beneficiaries was established early on, not by intention
but as a result of the pattern of farm size distribution. About half the farmers
in LLDP were outside the credit program by the late 1970s. A survey in 1990
found that this figure had risen to almost 70 per cent.
4.20        A particularly favored group of farmers were those who participated
in the livestock activities of LLDP.  Less than one per cent of the area's
22/   Later assumptions were more conservative.  By the time of the appraisal of
Karonga II it was expected that only one-third of farm families would
adopt the improved packages.  The PCR on Karonga II believed that all
these had already been reached under the first phase.



- 34 -
farmers participated in the stall-feeding, dairying and poultry activities and
these tended to be the larger farmers; the criterion for being allowed to have
dairy cattle, for example, was to have two hectares of fodder.  A somewhat
greater number benefitted from the more general livestock development activities
such as artificial insemination and dip tanks, but only about 10 per cent of
farmers owned livestock. This small number received the full attention of the
specialized livestock staff.
4.21        The adoption of the block extension system in 1982 was, among other
objectives, intended to widen the contact of the extension staff with farmers,
particularly the non-credit receiving farmers. However, this objective was not
achieved and the extension service continued to concentrate on the creditworthy
group.  This situation has persisted, with later projects not even expecting to
affect more than a small proportion of farmers; only 18 per cent of farmers in
NRDP IV were expected to be members of credit groups.
4.22        The farmers who have benefitted from the NRDP are the larger farmers.
The Farmer Clubs, with their mutual responsibility for debt repayment, tend by
their nature to be groups of larger farmers. All the credit goes through Farmer
Clubs. Most of the effozts of the extension system are devoted to Farmer Club
members. Most of the fertilizer is sold on credit (indeed the system implicitly
discourages cash sales of fertilizer); and most of the credit (80 per cent) is
used for fertilizer.  Figures are not available to show the distribution of
seasonal credit by farm size but surveys show that 80 per cent of it goes to
landholders with more than one hectare. Figures for fertilizer consumption (and
fertilizers are the main source of benefits under NRDP), show that only 5 percent
of fertilizers is used on farms of under one hectare, compared with 50 percent
on farms of more than 2.5 hectares; each size group accounts for about one
quarter of the cropped area.23/ Figures provided to the mission in Lilongwe
North-East indicated that only 6 percent of fertilizers were provided to
non-members of Farmers Clubs.
4.23        The result, in the words of the Bank's Technical Issues Review of
NRDP (op. cit. para 34), is that:
"interventions made under past rural development programs have had
considerable impact on those farming households with above average land
holdings who have gained access to credit, purchased input supplies,
received extension advice and sold surplus produce. In any society there
are groups who are not touched by such services and who become almost
"invisible" because they have little or no contact with extension staff,
are not eligible for credit, cannot afford inputs and have no surplus
produce to sell. The disturbing feature about the Malawian situation is
that, because of the pressure on land and the small size of holdings, this
group constitutes about 70 per cent of the rural population."
Z3/   See Sahn and Arulpragasam, op. cit. Table 3.



- 35 -
4.24        It is thus clear that these projects did not fulfil the Government's
stated objective of redistributing income in favor of the rural poor, indeed they
have exacerbated the mal-distribution of wealth by creating in effect a
privileged group of smallholders who have benefitted by having access to the
projects resources, and who also obtain the benefits of subsidized fertilizers
and seeds.  It is also doubtful if the projects meet the Bank's criteria for
classification as rural development projects, that of 50 per cent or more of the
direct benefits accruing to the rural target group.   This target group, in
present day terms, would be all households farming less than 1.0 hectares and
half of those farming between 1 and 1.5 hectares, precisely the group that is
left out of NRDP.24/
Non-Quantifiable Imnact
4.25        The main achievement of NRDP, to which the projects under audit have
been major contributors, has been to enable Halawi to establish, train and staff
a structure of agricultural administration and management which is capable of
reaching virtually every farmer in the country and which, if adequate input
supplies and productivity-raising research packages were available, would be
capable of transforming the agricultural situation.  It has set up the basic
structure necessary for agricultural growth; unfortunately this structure alone
is not sufficient to ensure growth. It has set up an effective credit system
which has had a significant impact on increasing fertilizer consumption by those
farmers who had the resources to be credit-worthy. The follow-on projects for
research, extension and credit would not have been possible without the firm
foundation laid in the NRDP projects. Its success in helping ADMARC to establish
an effective input supply and output marketing system has been limited as has
been the attempts to improve the transportation system.
4.26        The projects have also had important direct and indirect social
impact. The PCR for Phase III mentions in particular the enormous benefits of
LLDP in providing an essential stability and giving the rural community some
pride in their agricultural pursuits at a time when the attractions of the
rapidly growing urban developments in the new capital city might have been
expected to stimulate movement to the urban area, thus making possible a more
controlled urban growth.   The projects have also stimulated the growth of
secondary employment activities at the village level with shopkeepers beginning
to provide a wide range of goods and services that were not previously available,
although the proximity to the capital city can also take credit for part of this.
4.27        There have also been important health benefits particularly in
Karonga, despite all the staffing difficulties and drug shortages that were
experienced. The PCR on Karonga II found that increased sales of farm output to
ADMARC were reflected in increased savings and also in increased expenditure on

Reduction, Washington DC, March 22 1990, para. 3.03.

education, the latter being reflected in increases in school attendance and in
more school construction on a self-help basis. There are also indications that
rural savings increased as the volume of sales to ADMARC increased.
4.28        NRDP vas above all a national program and must in the end be judged
by its national impact, in particular by the growth of the agricultural sector
generally.   Although NRDP was only concerned directly with the smallholder
agricultural sector, indirectly it must have had a substantial impact on the
other part of the sector - the estates. These went through a period of rapid
expansion during the seventies financed largely through financial surpluses
extracted by ADMARC from the smallholder sector (surpluses considerably larger
than those going into the sector through external aid).   Indirectly the
government was able to pursue this expansion because it had an alternative source
of funding for the smallholder sector - NRDP snd the predecessor IRDPs. The Bank
refused to finance the estates directly through an Agricultural Development Bank
project when this was proposed in 1973 by the government but since resources are
fungible they were able to pursue their dual policy as long as funds for
smallholder development were flowing in. One can thus argue that the very high
growth of Malawi's agricultural sector as a whole during the seventies was made
possible by the availability of external finance for the smallholder sector,
despite its highly adverse impact on income distribution within the sector, and
thus conclude that the indirect benefits of NRDP were considerable. On the other
hand, one can also argue that the growth of the estate sector was unsustainable
and that the agricultural sector as a whole, estates and smallholders together,
might be in a stronger position today if the surpluses from the smallholder
sector had Len reinvested directly and external finance gone into the estates;
certainly the smallholders would have been better off. This would not contradict
the fact that the indirect benefits were considerable, only highlighting that
they might have been even greater had another agricultural policy been followed.
At the time, the smallholder strategy of the Bank, which predated the
government's support for the estates, seemed the correct approach, given the
Bank's poverty orientation.  The Bank has been faulted 25/ for not identifying
the adverse impact of the new estate development policies on the smallholder
sector quickly enough but nevertheless the investment in NRDP itself clearly was
a causative factor in the growth of the sector as a whole, a growth that was as
high as that of many apparently more prosperous developing countries.
Input and Outgut Pricilnt Policies
4.29        It has already been mentioned that the policy environment, especially
the impafl of changes in crop prices on the mix of crops, over the period under
review, has been more significant than any project actions in bringing about crop
production changes. This can be seen in the way the pattern of crop area changes
within a project area mirrored the pattern of changes in the rest of the country,
except where local weather effects distorted the trend.  The history of the
projects under audit is one of continued Bank efforts to achieve a favorable
251   See Kydd and Spooner, op. cit.

price environment that would provide farmers with the right signals to the most
economic crop mix and use of inputs so as to support the production objectives
of the projects.
4.30        As early as 1973 the Bank realized that low producer prices were a
factor in the low adoption rates of the LLDP packages for maize and groundnuts.
However, though the point was raised with the Government on several occasions
over the next few years, it was not pursued.  The Government argued that low
agricultural prices would enable low wages to continue and thus have a beneficial
effect on employment. At the time of the appraisal of Karonga II in late 1975
the issue still did not seem of major importance. Official producer prices for
maize, which were set by ADMARC, after lagging behind international prices, had
just been increased.  ADMARC was making a loss on its rice trading activities;
put another way it was subsidizing Karonga rice farmers. In addition the project
area's traditional marketing ties in neighboring Zambia, Mozambique and Tanzania
led to the expectation that much of the increased production would be marketed
outside ADMARC's official channels at much higher prices although the project did
not attempt to support the unofficial marketing channels, something that was
later regretted.26/
4.31        During implementation little concern was expressed that prices were
hindering production.   The PCR, however, comments that for rice and maize
favorable producer prices were the main factor encouraging farmers to increase
crop areas; and that for cotton and groundnuts 'relatively lower gross margins'
were the main contributing factor to the failure to meet appraisal targets. (PCR,
Report No. 5340, dated November 28, 1984, paras 9.3.0 and 9.3.1). These are
almost exactly the same comments that the PPAR of Karonga I had made: "If farmers
had been paid prices around the economic value, at least on average, for cotton
and groundnuts, it is likely that the acreages of these crops would have been
near to those estimated at appraisal" (Report No. 2576 of June 29, 1979 para.
25).27/
4.32        By late 1977, when NRDP I was appraised,  the Bank had become
explicitly aware of the extent to which price policy was an important determinant
26/   The Project Completion Report on Karonga  II commented  as follows:
"Government ignored a flourishing parallel market which was able to absorb
additional rice and maize production. In retrospect, it was unfortunate
that the efficiency and resourcefulness of this parallel market was not
recognized and assistance provided through the project to its development.
This could have had a much larger impact than did the attempt to assist
ADMARC".
27/  The whole issue of Bank-Malawi relations over agricultural pricing policy
is discussed Kydd, J.G. and Spooner, N.J., The World Bank's Analysis of
Malawian Agriculture:  Changint PersDectives 1966 to 1985, a working paper
for Managing Agricultural Development in Africa, World Bank, 1987.



- 38 -
of project success. This aware-ness was reflected in the SAR' concerns about
pricing policy: "There is evidence that for groundnuts and cotton in some areas
the returns per manday have been much less than for maize and rice, resulting in
farmers giving more attention to the latter at the expense of the former.
Production of oriental tobacco is also adversely affected.   Present pricing
policies do not appear to be in the best interest of expanding production in
smallholder areas." (para 6.03) The appraisal report raised the question whether
the best way to give greater weight to smallholder pricing and marketing problems
would  not  be  to  split  ADMARC's  marketing  activities  and  development
responsibilities.   Reflecting these concerns, under the Project an official
pricing advisory committee was to be set up to consider this issue and to keep
prices under review. Assurances were obtained that ADMARC would recruit two
economists and other staff to meet the input and marketing needs of NRDP.
ADMARC, not a signatory to the Credit Agreement, was unwilling to cooperate and
nothing constructive happened for some two years.
4.33        It was not until the First Structural Adjustment Loan (SAL) in June
1981 that the Bank was able to start a dialogue with the Government about crop
pricing policy. Once again the SAL appraisal had found that the slow growth in
the production of smallholder export crops was due to the failure of ADMARC to
pass on to farmers more than a small proportion of the relatively high export
prices obtained in the 1970s. Under the SAL a mechanism to review crop prices
was put into place and a methodology for deciding on appropriate crop prices was
agreed. Despite this, under NRDP IV assurances were again obtained that crop
prices for the years of the project would be set at levels acceptable to IDA.
Indeed, the Bank would not negotiate the project until an assurance had been
received that tobacco prices would be raised.
4.34        The new price-setting system had a major impact on the projects under
audit, though not in ways that the Bank had expected. The Bank was concerned to
increase foreign exchange earnings through the production of smallholder crops
for export; the Government, after a disastrous harvest in 1980, was concerned to
increase maize production. As a result, the 1982183 crop season saw a very large
(67 per cent) rise in the price of maize, reflecting the Government's greater
concern for food security than for export crops.  This led to a 40 per cent
increase in the LLDP maize area and an abrupt fall in rice production in Karonga
as farmers switched from rice (whose price had not increased) to maize. Rice
production remained at around this reduced level in subsequent years as the
maize/rice price ratio continued to favor maize.  Groundout prices too were
increased sharply (by 53 per cent) in 1982183 and this led to an unexpected and
sustained increase in their production in the whole NRDP IV area and to some
extent in Karonga. Tobacco prices, however, were kept substantially below export
parity levels, reflecting ADMARC's long-standing policy of using tobacco to
generate surpluses, and fell in real terms from 1983 onwards.  This had the
result that tobacco production in NRDP IV stagnated contrary to expectations.
It also fell sharply in the old LLDP area.
4.35        Another change in pricing policy was also introduced during the
implementation of NRDP IV, although it is unclear what impact it may have had on
the project. The role of ADMARC as the monopoly buyer of maize was relaxed. It



-39 -
became a market stabiliiation agency buying and selling in defence of a band of
producer and consumer pr:.ces, trading alongside private traders at the floor and
ceiling prices.
4.36        Another exogenous impact on project implementation was the dramatic
rise of fertilizer prices after 1981 on top of the already steep increases in the
mid to late 19709. The increase was kept to about fourfold during the 1980. by
the Government's policy of subsidizing fertilizers, contrary to the Bank's
advice.  These fertilizer price increases were only partially offset by crop
price increases.  The fertilizer nutrient/maize price ratio for sulphate of
ammonia, for instance, fell from 5.7 in 1980/81 before the price increases began,
to 3.9 after the big maize price increase of 1982/83 (i.e a 30 per cent decrease
in the amount of maize needed to buy a unit of fertilizer), then gradually
climbed again reaching 7.0 in 1986/87 before falling in the subsequent two years
to 5.3 as a result of substantial fresh increases in the price of maize. It is
impossible to evaluate the impact of these price changes on thaw projects'
outcomes since fertilizer supplies were never able to meet demand.   This
phenomenon of increasing consumption in the face of rising prices existed
throughout Malawi during this period indicating that fertilizer supply was
inadequate to meet the demand throughout the country.
4.37        This brief description of some of the external events that influenced
the implementation of the projects under audit highlights a number of points.
First, that the Bank was not successful in initiating an effective dialogue on
pricing policy in the context of its area-based projects, even with a national
rural development project; too many other agencies with divergent interests were
also involved.  Only with a financial crisis and a SAL did an effective dialogue
begin. Second, even when a price-setting mechanism of which it approved was in
place, the results did not lead to the results which the Bank had anticipated,
because the Bank's and the Government's priorities were different; to improve the
balance of payments by encouraging agricultural exports versus food
self-sufficiency.   In the case of fertilizer pricing policy also the Bank's
attempt to get the Government to remove subsidies came up against a different set
of Government priorities. Third, farmer response to the new price policy was
merely to reallocate land between crops in accordance with price changes. There
is no indication of any aggregate production response.28/ The implication of
this for the NRDP projects, whose main purpose was to increase productivity, is
that a deliberately managed price policy, even one based on export-import price
parities, is not a sufficient condition to bring about growth. Unless the other
conditions are also right, adequate and timely fertilizer supplies, and proven
productivity raising packages above all, the planned growth will not occur.
Neither of the latter two conditions were met so the projects' impacts were much
below expectations.
28/   Sahn and Arulpragasam (op. cit. pp 23-4) argue that the production of both
export crops and maize stagnated in the 1980s because real prices of both
sets of crops did not rise so that there were no price incentives.

V. SUSTAINABILITY
5.1         One of the reasons for the introduction of a National Rural
Development Program, in place of individual area development projects, was to
keep the financial burden of spreading the system over the whole country within
the available resources. The individual area projects were too staff-intensive
and too expensive to be replicated nationwide. At the time the concept was first
proposed neither the Government nor the Bank had any clear idea either of what
the eventual burden of the Program would be or what resources Malawi might have
in due course to put towards its financing.   The type of projects being
considered were not revenue-generating,  The Bank was nevertheless quick to
become concerned about the long-term budgetary implications of the Program on
which it was embarking.   The appraisal report of Karonga II, for instance,
contained calculations that showed that future operating costs would not be
covered by any revenue generated by the project, even including any ADMARC
profits from incrementable marketable production. It went on to say: "in view
of the Government's narrow revenue base, it is not clear whether the additional
recurrent costs could be absorbed without some changes in policies, for example
concerning pricing of agricultural produce or the taxation system. Therefore,
and also because additional deficits may result from the implementation of future
NRDP projects, it was agreed at negotiations that the Government would undertake
a  study....of  the  long-term  budgetary  implications  of  all  agricultural
development projects" (para 6.07).
5.2         This study came out in September 1977, just before NRDP I was
appraised. It showed that, only taking into account existing projects and those
to be financed under NRDP I, the Govenument would need to find an extra MK 17
million to finance the annual incremental recurrent costs of maintaining these
projects, compared with the net revenue expenditure of MOA in 1977178 of less
than  4K 6 million.   The additional incremental revenue the projects would
generate was MK 2 million. It was also estimated that ADMARC would make an
additional NR 8 million profit from marketing project production. Since ADMARC's
profits did not enter the Government's exchequer the deficit to the Government
was in reality NK 15 million or two and a half times MOA's then total revenue
expenditure.
5.3         There were two schools of thought in the Bank about this problem of
the Size of NRDP in relation to the resources available to finance it.  The
Central Projects Staff view was that it would be "more meaningful to examine a
number of development designs in relation to their predicted costs and benefits"
rather than to opt for just one; and that the Bank needed better assurances that
it "was supporting the Government to cut its (development) coat according to its
(fiscal) cloth" and not just "continue to put off the evil day when it has to
meet the recurrent budgetary commitments arising from the development path which
began with the Lilongwe project"'. The Regional Projects staff view was that
this was a similar problem to that seen in other agriculturally dependent
countries where rapid improvement in living standards was sought but where the
productive base responded only slowly. "If we wish to transfer resources to the



- 41 -
less developed countries, and put them in agriculture and give them to the
poorest sectors now at the subsistence level we must recognize that there may be
a considerable lag between the expenditure of capital and concomitant recurrent
costs and the expansion of marketed production to a level that can produce
sufficient Government taxes to maintain the recurrent services necessary to
obtain and maintain that production". (M11P I Issues Paper of December 13, 1977,
para 16).  The paper went on to propose that the Bank continue what it had
tacitly agreed to do in the IRDPs, to undertake the funding of projects,
including the funding of recurrent costs, until Government revenues had increased
sufficiently to support them; reco mending that it should finance second phase
projects whose funding would cover all of the recurrent costs that the GovernmLnt
could not finance from revenue and treating them as capital costs. The Bank and
most other donors were already financing 852 of total project costs at the time,
including a substantial proportion of operating costs.
5.4         The question of postponing negotiations until the problem could be
examined was rejected on the grounds that it was important not to delay the
project as it was the only one in Malawi that was addressing the issues of
increasing the incomes of the poorer sections of the community.
5.5         During negotiations assurances were obtained that "the Government
would prepare and submit to IDA for comments by end September 1979 a report on
the budgetary implications of the national development program and the measures
it proposes to follow to ensure the progress and viability of the program". No
covenant was included in the Credit Agreement to this effect. Loan Committee
review of the project stressed the importance of the study and its timely
completion.
5.6         In the appraisal report, which did not come out till November 1978,
the financing problem seemed to have evaporated.   ADMARC's profits  from
incremental production marketed under the project, principally tobacco, were,
according to the appraisal report, to be transferred to the Government's budget;
together with other revenues these would cover the incremental recurrent costs.
There was no mention in the appraisal report of how the recurrent costs of other
projects were to be financed.
5.7         The study was overtaken by the financial crisis that developed in
1979, the result, among other factors, of the rise in international interest
rates, the decline in Malawi's terms of trade following the second oil price
shock, and the burgeoning budget deficit, caused mostly by a large increase in
civil service salaries in 1978. The MOA's Planning Division, still understaffed,
was too fully employed in coping with budget cuts for 1980/81 and 1981/82 and the
preparation of NRDP III to be able to devote adequate time to long-term studies.
It did, however, prepare a five-year forecast which it sent to the Ministry of
Finance for the Bank's consideration. This was not forwarded because the MOP
wanted a similar exercise completed by other ministries first. In the end the
Bank never received the repcrt and the NRDP Review Mission of late 1981 carried
out the work instead; and ADMARC's profits were never transferred to the
Government budget, indeed tobacco prices collapsed in 1979 and ADMARC's profits
collapsed with them.



- 42 -
5.8         The whole issue of recurrent Cost financing then also got caught up
in the start of the SAL process (the first SAL was appraised in mid 1980). The
budgetary crisis had meant that MOA was unable to meet its on-going recurrent
cost obligations which had been increasing rapidly under the combined effect of
civil service salary increases and the transfer of a number of projects
from the development to the revenue account.291
5.9         In addition, under NRDP I, the Government had agreed with IDA that,
in order to reduce the impact of a sudden transfer of operating costs to the
revenue budget at the time external financing finished, it would transfer an
increasing share of the operating cost to the revenue account during project
implementation. The MOA was unable to meet most of these obligations and, as
part of the first SAL, the Hinistry of Finance was required to transfer
sufficient funds to MOA to enable it to do so. The PPAR on SAL I comments that
this very specific condition was made without a careful anslyeis of the budget
and in the eyes of Malawi officials "was no more than a safeguard devised by Bank
agricultural projects staff to ensure the full counterpart funding of on-going
Bank financed project activity".10I
5.10        Concurrently with this, the NRDP Review was studying the recurrent
cost problem. It concluded that the likely deficits in the MOA's revenue budget
for the period up till 1985/86 for existing projects were dramatic (e.g. a
deficit rising to about 502 of the likely availability in 1985186, just for NRDP)
but that recurrent cost implications for later years for future projects were
"not nearly so problematic".   It made some suggestions about possible minor
changes for on-going projects but had no real solution. Looking to the longer
term it had suggestions for the design of future projectos e.g. cutting down the
farmer: extension worker ratio; lengthening project life; reducing construction
standards; transferring operating costs to the revenue account during
implementation. It concluded that the phasing of future NRDP projects need not
be affected by the present recurrent cost problems of existing projects "provided
these problems are dealt with now and proper measures are taken in future to
ensure a smooth transfer of operating costs from development to revenue account
during the project period or an establishment of operating costs on revenue
account from the beginning" (para 2.64).
5.11        The Review was able to come to this conclusion because its basic
philosophy had already accepted the premise that the returns to NRDP were
29/   Under Malawi's budgetary system most projects are financed by external
donors and the majority of project costs, including most operating costs,
are on the Ministry of Finance's development account.   As external
assistance is phased out thw, projects operating costs are transferred to
the revenue account and firanced entirely from local sources.
"I  Report No. 6833 of June 12 1987, para 29.

acceptable" and that "with sufficient access by smallholders to technical advice
and to credit for purchasing inputs, with timely input delivery and access to
markets for crops, and given proper incentives to smallholders, agricultural
productivity and farmers' incomes would be significantly increased" (para 1.31).
Its view of the recurrent cost problem was colored by its conclusion that "the
real question for financing existing and future NRDP projects is whether the
benefits justify the cost", not whether the cost was affordable; having decided
before the Review started that- the recurrent costs were justified it concluded
that the question of how to pay for them should be addressed by the Government
and that this issue was beyond the scope of the Review (para 2.66). It did,
however, touch on the possibility that some of ADMARC'a profits, or some
additional crop taxes, might be used to offset the MOA deficit.
5.12        Throughout this period (mid 1980 to mid 1981) the shape of NRDP III
was being discussed between the Bank and MOA. The magnitude of the budgetary
crisis made it apparent that funding difficulties, which had hitherto only been
apparent on a project by project basis, were a fundamental factor to be taken
into account in project design. The issue was raised as to the appropriate mix
between infrastructure and operational components, how to cut down the
post-project recurrent costs and even whether the Government could afford a
project that might end up with a negative cash flow. One step was to eliminate
a number of new areas where the Government had proposed to start RDPs. Other
than this, however, the concerns about recurrent costs never became reflected in
the final design.  The project became principally a means of financing the
recurrent costs of the on-going Karonga II. The Bank had long accepted the
principle of financing recurrent costs during the development phase of a project
and, despite the fact that KRDP would have been on-going for ten years at the
time the new phase started, there seems to have been no difficulty in continuing
to finance recurrent costs for another five years.   However, to make this
financing of recurrent costs acceptable, a number of new components within
Karonga were included, many with their own recurrent cost implications. Thus the
on-going macro-economic developments were put on one side in the final design on
the argument that "sectoral issues should be kept separate from essentially
project ones". The concerns of Central Projects Staff about sustainability were
ignored, with the "-eion arguing that the project could always be scaled back
during implementati, if the NRDP Review proposed fresh standards. The Review
did just this and so, even before the Project became effective, a supervision
mission repcrted that "an issue which was not foreseen at aRpraisal but has now
surfaced is that of extension staff density". Attempts to scale the staffing
intensity down failed. This is a clear case where the pressure to lend overcame
the resistance of those who argued for delay until future project design could
be adequately evaluated.
5.13        Shortages of recurrent funds were a permanent feature of the closing
years of NRDP I and the whole of NRDP III. They are reported to have caused
major setbacks to the efficient operation of the extension and research
activities. They played an important part in the need to extend the Closing
Dates of both projects by at least two years.



- 44 -
5.14        The design of NRDP IV was able to incorporate the recommendations of
the NEDP Review for cutting costs and the proposed road and health components
were excluded and the farmer extension worker ratio reduced. In addition, the
recurrent cost problem was believed to have been solved once again.   The
projections of the 1982 Economic Report showed that, contrary to the findings of
the NRDP Review, on-going NRDP projects would have adequate resources for their
maintenance as they were transferred to the recurrent budget. Also the second
SAL was about to be appraised and this was expected to tackle the problem of
budgetary resources both by generating counterpart funds and making the provision
of adequate recurrent funds part of the conditionality. So the only proviso that
the Project contained about the recurrent budget was that the transfer of staff
(salaries) to the recurrent budget would be scheduled over the life of the
project to prevent a large transfer at the end.
5.15        The same problems of recurrent budget shortfalls as were being
experienced in all the other on-going projects recurred during the implementation
of NRDP IV and were almost certainly made worse by the covenant which had
required that all staff costs should be transferred to the revenue budget during
implementation. The shortfalls were also at least partially responsible for a
two year delay in project completion.
5.16        These shortfalls in the revenue budget were not project-related.
They were a feature of Malawi in general and MOA in particular at the time. The
most recent Bank report on Malawi' 8 public expenditure situation has examined the
extent of the problem.311 It found that the increases in the revenue budget
of MOA had not been commensurate with investment levels for at least the past
five years. Allocations in the revenue budget in the 1984/85 to 1987188 period
had declined in real terms compared to a 22 percent increase that would have been
needed to meet recurrent costs in full. The situation deteriorated further in
1988/89. The prospects for the future were found to be no better, with the
likelihood of a continued shortfall unless foreign donors substantially increase
their funding of recurrent expenditures. The President's Report on IDA's latest
funding for the agricultural sector also stressed the same point about the need
for donor assistance for recurrent expenditures "in appreciation of the fact that
recurrent expenditures which result in improved technologies and enhanced
knowledge of such technologies among farmers are in the nature of development
investments".321/   From the point of view of this audit, it is the very
projects under audit which have been partly responsible for the large increase
in recurrent costs which has occurred and the question which arises is whether
this was either inevitable or worthwhile.

5.17        The impact of the shortage of recurrent budgets is felt even more
acutely after the withdrawal of the donor which has been financing the project
than during implementation. The transfer of staff to the recurrent budget during
implementation makes the impact of the withdrawal worse because it is not the
staff salary component (personal emoluments) of the recurrent budget which bears
the burden of any shortfall, it is the other recurrent costs, such as those of
fuel and vehicle maintenance, of building maintenance, stores, spares, training
and general running costs, known as recurrent departmental charges'.  The ratio
of recurrent departmental charges to personal emoluments (RDC/PE ratio) gives an
indication of the relative adequacy of one against the other.   Experience
indicates that for efficient project operation recurrent departmental charges
need to be higher than personal emoluments i.e. a ratio greater than 1.0.  The
ratio for MOA as a whole was 1.04 in 1985/86, declining to 0.8 in 1987/88.  For
Karonga ADD, since NRDP III financing ceased, the ratio has been 0.53 in 1988/89
and 0.41 in 1989/90 and an estimated 0.47 for 1900/91, indicating a critical
shortfall in funds available for recurrent expenditures. For Lilongwe ADD the
ratios were 0.48 and 0.34 in 1988189 and 1989/90 and an estimated 0.38 in
1990/91.   This pattern reflects the transfer of staff costs from NRDP IV
financing to the revenue budget and an even more critical shortage of operating
funds than in Karonga.
5.18        These shortfalls in recurrent departmental charges are literally
crippling to project activity, particularly to staff mobility and the maintenance
of all capital assets, in particular vehicles. A study by the Evaluation Unit
in LADD found that in former project areas supervisory staff and subject matter
specialists could not function and a supervision mission, commenting on the
study, felt their employment in such circumstances was a waste of money. In
Karonga the audit mission found a similar situation. The staffing situation was
relatively satisfactory, with 88Z of posts filled. Many of the project vehicles
were still on the road, thanks to a UK-financed rehabilitation program. Shortage
of operating funds, however, was preventing the staff from doing their work.
Typical of the situation, for instance, was one of the three Extension Planning
Areas in Chitipa District; the six advisory staff were reduced from having one
motorcycle each to having one for all six, and that one motorcycle had to cover
an area of more than 500 square kilometers. Most of their supervision was thus
confined to areas within walking distance. Another example of the effect of
recurrent fund shortages was that training was suffering badly. At the Meru
Residential Training Center, built under the project and still fully staffed
(except for one less cook and waiter), the number of farmers courses had fallen
from 13 per year under the project to two per year since; training for project
staff was down from about 2-300 per year to 82 per year. The animal health
program had also almost come to a halt for lack of funds to buy acaricides for
the dips built under the project. The dips could not be used regularly, as they
should be to control pests, but only when acaricides was available; lack of funds
to repair the project pump meant the dips could not he emptied between seasons.
5.19        This situation clearly indicates that the shortage of operating funds
is severely reducing the impact of the projects under audit now that project
funding has ceased. As the Public Expenditure Review points out this is not
confined only to these projects and it is not primarily a problem of maintenance

and materials expenditures.33/  The number of extension workers per hectare
of arable land is already very low by African standards, so it is not that the
personal emoluments part of the revenue budget is very high. It is a problem of
an overall squeeze on funds for total recurrent expenditures. Yet expenditures
from the revenue budget are being reduced at the cost of the efficiency of the
systems that have been established. The main solution of the Review is for
donors to fund recurrent expenditures.
5.20        The question thus arises, why did the Bank stop funding recurrent
expenditures through area-based projects in Malawi?   The Bank helped the
Government to establish a National Rural Development Program in 1978 with the
objective of covering the whole country with RDPs over a 20-year period. There
was at least an implicit commitment to funding the Program as it had been funding
Lilongwe and Karonga for three or four phases. Yet within five years the Bank
stopped funding fresh RDPs,34/ and the RDPs it had financed, with the
exception of Lilongwe and Karonga, were all passed over to the revenue budget
within five or six years, knowing fairly certainly that the revenue budget was
too small to allow them to be adequately financed. There seem to be two reasons
for this apparent abandonment of a policy on which it had embarked with the
Government with such evident enthusiasm. The first is that as the result of
better policy analysis the Bank realized that the other obstacles to the
effective operation of the RDPs could not be tackled within the confines of an
area-based project.   They required another approach.   The second is the
unforeseen financial crisis which overtook events and which pre-empted much of
the available financing for SAL-based lending.
5.21        The new approach was a series of structural projects tackling those
problems which could not be satisfactorily dealt with under area-based lending;
fertilizer supply (1983), research (1985), extension and planning (1985), credit
(1987)  and marketing  (1988).   The last financing in the sector was the
Agricultural Sector Adjustment Program Credit which contained nothing for NRDP.
No support to area-based projects is anticipated in the coming years although
some of the lending is jilanned to provide support on a time-slice basis to
research, extension and credit and this may be of some help in covering future
recurrent expenditure. To some extent the SAL-based lending may be helping to
33/   Shortage of operating expenditures is not confined to the agricultural
sector either. It is a financial issue affecting all Malawian government
services - indeed almost all governments in Africa.
34/   The Bank did help appraise projects in four other RDPs that were funded by
IFAD between 1981 and 1985. The Bank had also planned to finance another
area-based projecc in Mzuzu ADD, (NRDP V) but during appraisal it was
decided to switch the emphasis of the project to the provision of more
specific support to the extension system and it was renamel Agricultural
Extension and Planning Support Project (Cr. 1626).

finance the revenue budget of MOA through the generation of counterpart
funds.35/
5.22        The reluctance of the Bank to provide further direct support for the
RDPs which it has financed in the past may also arise from the fact that the past
projects have already financed most of the infrastructure which was needed on an
immediate basis in the RDP and that future projects would largely be confined to
financing recurrent costs. The logic of this is hard to follow. The Bank was
prepared to finance Lilongwe and Raronga for 15 years, yet it is cutting off more
recently adopted RDPs after only five years. If the Bank were to follow the
logic of its own arguments, ("recurrent expenditures which result in improved
technologies and enhanced knowledge of such technologies among farmers are in the
nature of development investment") and also to follow its cwn suggestion to other
donors to finance recurrent cost, then it could help to salvage some of its past
investments by continuing to finance these RDPs. The problem which its present
policy is causing is that, by the time it has solved all the national and
sectoral problems needed to make the extension service effective, the extension
service itself will have become run down for lack of an operating budget.
VI. ISSUES AND LESSONS
Issues
The Evolution from Integrated Area to Policy-based Lending
6.1         The length of time covered by the projects under audit makes it
possible to analyze the evolution of the Bank's lending strategy in Malawi from
its beginning in 1968. The start was the Lilongwe and Shire rural development
projects. The successful implementation of these and their successive phases led
the Bank to the conclusion that it had found a project design that was suited to
Malawian conditions; and one which could be extended to other parts of the
country with some modifications to take into account financial and human resource
constraints. The outcome was NRDP. During the five years which it took from the
time the idea was first proposed till the first NRDP project was approved the
Bank continued to finance the old-style IRDPs.
35/   The Region argues that, once all RDPe were covered by donor support, far
from deserting NRDP it was logical for the Bank to proceed to support the
various component services of NRDP through specific National Service
Projects.   The new Agricultural Services Project,  in the pipeline,
continues to provide support to NRDP, indeed is really NRDP VI; and the
provision of operating funds for the National Extension and Planning
Support Project has been of prime importance during preparation, including
a review of staffing levels.   The allocation of proceeds under that
project has also been amended to increase the proportion useable for
operating costs.



- 48 -
6.2         The actual modifications that were made to the IRDP design were
cosmetic. The flrst NRDP projects were as costly in financial and human resource
terms as their predecessors. It was not until NRDP IV that the proportion of
infrastructure financing Was reduced and the farmer:extension worker ratio was
reduced to a level which was regarded as realistic in terms of likely staff
availability.   At the same time every analysis of the recurrent costs of
financing such a level of extension showed that it was not sustainable with
Malawi's own resources.   No analysis was ever made of what a financially
sustainable NRDP would look like or whether the farmertextension worker ratio was
a meaningful criterion.   The Bank must therefore take a major share of the
responsibility for the present difficulties of MOA in trying to find enough
resources to operate and maintain the present structure which has been set up
under the IRDPs and NRDP.
6.3         The Bank never made any explicit commitment to go on financing NRDP,
but implicit in the early documents relating to NRDP is the understanding, that
the Bank would continue to support it financially during, the 15-20 time period
which was agreed it would require.
6.4         The Bank stopped financing area-based projects when it realized that
they were not achieving the anticipated results in increased agricultural
production. The principal reason that the anticipated results were not being
achieved was the lack of packages of yield increasing technology that were
acceptable to other than a small irpRortion of farmers. It is extraordinary with
hindsight to see how long it took the Bank to appreciate the significance of the
low rate of uptake of the packages that were being promoted.  Part of this
stemmed from the fact that project impact was initially being measured by
comparing crop yields of 'adopters' with those of 'non-adopters', where there was
a significant difference, and also by the 'scheme' approach of farmer groups,
with those not joining the groups not being part of the project.  It thus looked
as if the project were leading to large and widespread increases in yield whereas
in reality the increases are confined to a small proportion of the farm
population. Another part of the reason for the Bank failing to appreciate what
was happening was the evident shortages of improved seed and fertilizer. This
appeared to be preventing farmers from adopting the recommended packages. Most
of the reason, however, must have been unwillingness to believe that farmers
could not want to adopt such an obvious route to increasing their production as
growing hybrid maize. Eventually the work of the evaluation staff showed that
only farmers with enough land to produce a surplus above their own food
requirements were adopting the recommended packages; and there were not many of
them.
6.5         Another compelling factor behirn' the abandonment of the area-based
NRDP approach was the realization that there was a whole range of other factors
which were directly reducing the success of the area-based projects which could
not be put right through area-based financing. The first of these was fertilizer
supply. Problems at the national level were affecting fertilizer supply at the
project level. This was a significant matter nationally; by 1981/82 NRDP I areas
were providing two-thirds of all maize bought by ADMARC. From this emerged the
1983 fertilizer project. The second was the research project of 1985 which was



- 49 -
to produce packages of improved practices which farmers would want to adopt.
Again this was not something that could be tackled within the confinee of an
area-based project. The third problem which it was felt should be tackled
through a national project was extension and planning. It seemed more important
to consolidate and improve the cost-effectiveness of the existing extensiont
structure than to expand it. This was approved in 1985. The fourth national
project was for credit, designed to consolidate the multiplying number of
area-based credit schemee into a national smallholder credit system. The
area-based approach had become too big and needed to be centrally managed to
allow flexible use of resources. This was approved in 1988.
6.6         The existence of a parallel series of SAL projects also allowed a
number of other policy-based problems that were identified as obstacles to NRDP
to be tackled after 1981. These includeds ti) setting up a system for crop
pricing that would keep prices in line with export/import parity levels in order
to provide farmers with appropriate price signals; (ii) increasing the amount of
funding from the Ministry of Finance to MOA's revenue budget; (iii) introducing
an element of competition in crop marketing by allowing the private sector to
compete with ADNARC for certain crops.
6 .7        The final evolution has been into sectoral lending through an
Agricultural Sector Adjustment Program credit.
6.8         The abandonment of the concept of integrated rural development has
not, in the audit's view, the result of a faulty des1LOn concept. At the time it
was introduced it met the felt need of a country where the basic rural
infrastructure was almost totally lacking. It seemed as important to provide
this as to increase agricultural production. The administrative structure did
not exist within the Government to handle it separately. The synergism argument
-may have been overdone but it was nevertheless administratively very convenient
to combine rural infrastructure with agricultural development in a single
package. As the administrative capacity to handle infrastructure development
grew, so the case for synergism was undermined. By the time NRDP IV was
appraised the case for including infrastructure within an agricultural project
had almost disappeared. The transition to functional projects was therefore a
natural progression.
6.9         The issue that remains unsolved at the end is how Malawi is to
continue to afford the scale of agricultural administration which has emerged at
the end of this long process without continued reliance on external financing.
In the long run the only answer seems to be to impose a tax on non-food crop
marketings. For all the disincentive effects this might have it seems fair that,
since the only beneficiaries of the extension system are those with a marketable
surplus, they should pay for it. If this reduces foreign exchange earnings the
loss to Malawi may well be less than the increase in external debt that would
otherwise be needed. The tax should not be imposed on food crops as this would
raise food prices for farm families who cannot produce their subsistence needs.
6.10        In the shorter term external donors will have to be prepared to
finan' e recurrent costs. Since the Bank agrees that recurrent costs are in the



- 50 -
nature of development expenditures, provided they "result in improved
technologies and enhanced knowledge of such technologies among farmers" (i.e.
research and extension) then it should be considering a sector loan directed
towards supporting the extension system it has helped to set up, otherwise by the
time new and improved packages are available and all the other sectors issues are
sorted out, there will not be an effective extension system still in place.
Nature of Beneficiaries
6.11        It also took the Bank a surprisingly long time to become concerned
that virtually all the directly production-increasing benefits were concentrated
on the small group of farm families who cultivated enough land to produce a
surplus above their own subsistence requirements. For all the Bank was saying
about rural poverty at the time NRDP was conceived, NRDP has never really
benefitted those below the poverty line in Malawi. Other than some very general
statements in appraisal reports about project beneficiaries being in the target
group, there was no analysis of the needs of those who could not produce enough
to feed themselves. It is only quite recently that this has become a matter of
urgent debate.
6.12        The knowledge that the projects were only reaching the better-off,
credit-worthy farmers had become apparent in the early evaluation work of LLDP.
The immediate reaction to this in the subsequent projects appears to have been
to lower the expectations about the proportion of farmers who would benefit. It
was only when the Bank tried to broaden the coverage of the extension service,
away from its almost total concentration on Farmer Clubs, and reach out to
smaller farm families, that there is any indication that the Bank appreciated the
significance of its failure to help the below-subsistence families.   This
approach only began with the Extension and Planning Support Project, prepared
after the projects under audit had started to be implemented.
6.13        The important issue, from the point of view of the audit, is why it
took so long for the Bank to realize that its projects were not doing anything
to solve the problems of the below-subsistence farm families. The answer seems
to be that it was not until after the start of the SAL process, with the much
more searching analytical work on the agricultural sector that it induced, that
the Bank realized that their problems were different to the problems of the
larger farmers.  The apparent success of Malawi in maintaining self-sufficiency
in maize production had concealed the underlying gap between consumption and need
of this group. This led the Bank to put the emphasis on increasing production
for the market not for home consumption; and in SAL I the promotion of
smallholder export crops, not maize, was the priority in order to raise foreign
exchange earnings.
6.14        The scale of the problem is enormous, as the following figures show.
About 55 per cent of smallholders cultivate less than 1.0 hectare and cannot
produce enough to feed themselves; and about half of the 31 per cent who
cultivate between 1-2 hectares are unable to produce a surplus above subsistence
needs. Thus only about 30 per cent of farm families are capable with existing
technologies of producing a surplus. Only a proportion of these have benefitted



- 51 -
from NRDP. The major shortcoming of NRDP has been its inability to offer an
acceptable improved technology to the second layer of farmers, those with enough
land to produce a surplus, and thus be credit-worthy, if they could raise the
productivity of their farming systems.   This  is partly a matter of the
unacceptability of the improved technology on offer and partly of the
exclusiveness of the Farmer Clubs and their perfectly rational unwillingness to
accept non credit-worthy members. The problem of improving the lot of the
bottom 50 per cent of farm families is something which is greater than merely
improving the productivity of the farming system.
6.15        The pricing and marketing reforms introduced under the SALe have
similarly been of little relevance in production decisions for those farm
families who do not market any of their production. Pricing reforms that have
raised the price of maize in fact make 70 per cent of the farming population
worse off because they depend on the market for part of their consumption needs.
A recent study in Lilongwe, for instance, estimated that 75 per cent of farm
families would run out of food stocks by December 1990, four months before the
next harvest and that by the time of harvest over 90 per cent would have run
out.36/
Lessons
Cash Inputs in Subsistence Farming
6.16        The experience of these projects highlights the difficulties of
promoting the use of purchased inputs in an economy where the majority of farm
families do not produce even enough to meet their own subsistence needs and where
there are few other income-earning opportunities. Even if they were willing to
take the risk involved in using purchased inputs, most farm families do not have
the cash to buy inputs or to repay a loan if they got them on credit. Thus the
use of purchased inputs has been confined to the top 20 per cent who are capable
of producing a surplus. What the projects failed to do was to bring into the
cash economy the second layer of farm families, those with enough land who would
be capable of earning a surplus if they could raise the level of productivity of
their farming system. The Farmer Club credit system tended to keep out the
marginally credit-worthy might have been able to do so. The unsuitability of the
hybrid maize varieties for subsistence purposes compounded the problem. The
significance of the pilot burley tobacco component in NRDP III lay in
establishing its suitability as an alternative means of raising a surplus but
until 1990 smallholders were prohibited from cultivating it. Ways of broadening
the impact of NRDP are still being sought so far this remains an intractable
problem.

Lan_d Reistration
6.17        The land registration program in Lilongwe did not arise from any
deeply felt local need for a different system of land tenure.   It was an
externally perceived concept of a necessary condition for the development of a
commercial farming system. The lack of any apparent impact throws doubt on the
validity of the concept and indicates that attempts to 'modernize' systems of
land tenure need to be based on a more thorough understanding of the existing
system.
Soil Conservation
6.18        The lack of maintenance of the soil conservation works that were
constructed in Lilongwe indicates that the local population did not perceive that
they were of enough benefit to their farming operations to be worth the
organizational problems of maintaining them. The lesson here is that successful
soil conservation requires the active involvement of the local farming population
in solving problems they perceive as critical to their well-being. The lack of
impact of soil conservation components in subsequent projects is also
attributable in part to lack of local participation.
Ex-Post Economic Rates of Return
6.19        The description in Annex 1 of the repeated efforts to calculate ex
post ERRs on the basis of inadequate data and misleading assumptions about the
future, and the bewildering changes in the results with each subsequent
recalculation, indicas es the inadequacy of this measure as a guide to subsequent
action. The estimators of ERRs always appear to be straining to be optimistic.
As a result the Bank was persuaded into accepting the IRDPs as an economic
success for far too long, even though it was generally agreed that they were not
meeting the expected production levels. It is clear from the documentation on
file that the Bank wanted to believe them a success so it could go cn financing
subsequent phases. This may well have been the most appropriate course of action
but it was not one that could be justified by the evidence of past performance.
Outgut Pricing
6.20        From the time the Bank realized that crop prices were having an
unexpectedly large impact on project production levels, it spent a considerable
effort in trying to persuade the Government to review prices jointly in order to
get them 'right'. It eventually succeeded in getting the Government to set up
a functioning price review mechanism under SAL. The experience with this system
since it was introduced provides two lessons.  The first is that changes in
prices have not produced any measurable aggregate production response; they have
merely induced farmers to alter their crop mix. The second is that, unless the
Government and the Bank agree on the objectives of the price review, the crop mix
which results may not be the one the Bank anticipated. In Malawi's case the Bank
wanted the price signals to induce farmers to increase the production of crops



- 53 -
for export. The Government was more interested in food security and it fixed
prices to induce farmers to increase production of maizeS which they did.37/
Coordination with Non-Rroject Institutions
6.21        The Bank's experience in trying to obtain the cooperation of ADMARC
in the input supply and crop marketing components of the projects provides an
object lesson in the difficulty of using an outside agency which is not in full
agreement with project objectives.
6.22        ADMARC'e role in providing fertilizer and other purchased inputs was
in line with its statutory responsibilities. Difficulties arose, however, when
fertilizers were in short supply nationally. ADMARC naturally tended to favor
those areas where distribution Was easiest and cheapest. Karonga was the most
remote area in Malawi and thus tended to come low down on ADMARC's priority list.
Consequently much of the extension effort in creating a demand for fertilizer
went unfilled. Even in more favorably situated project areas, projects did not
necessarily receive preferential treatment. Thus fertilizer supply became one
of the project bottlenecks. Unlike in many other countries the Bank did not
finance fertilizer imports. It would perhaps have been better if it had done so
under these projects. It did so later under the fertilizer project, but this
did not give priority to the Bank-financed NRDP projects and they continued to
face fertilizer shortages.
6.23        Continual difficulty was experienced in getting ADMARC to construct
the supply and marketing depots which the projects called for. As ADMARC was not
a party to any of the agreements, and only answerable to the Government,
increasingly strong attempts in each project to make it comply came to naught.
To some extent this may have been a justified tactic on ADMARC's part as most of
anticipated incremental production never materialized. It also reflected the
differing objectives of ADMARC and the Bank. ADMARC's objective was to extract
a surplus from marketing smallholder crops in order to invest it in the estate
sector.   The Bank's objective was to increase ADMARC's investment in the
smallholder sector.   The Bank took a long while to realize its objectives
diverged from those of ADMARC. It was only with SAL II, when the role of the
private sector in crop marketing was encouraged, that the Bank was able to get
around ADMARC's monopsony marketing role.   Curiously enough the Bank then
proceeded to reverse its position by requiring ADMhARC to close some of its
markets where the throughput did not justify the costs.
37/   Failure to maintain the maize/ep?o  crop ratio subsequently led to a
switch back again to export crops. More recent concern again about food
security has led to further large price increases for maize.

PROJECT PERFORMANCE AUDIT
NAIAWI
ANNEX I
ECONOMIC RATE OF RETURN CALCULATIONS
1.     The Lilongwe Land Development Program has probably been the subject of
more impact studies than almost any other Bank projects and yet even in 1990
there is still controversy over what impact the projects actually had. This
annex reviews the series of attempts that have been made, ex ante and ex post,
to calculate the economic rates of return (ERRs) for the various phases of this
program and for the Karonga program as well.
2.     By the time the first Lilongwe project was appraised, the Bank had been
using rate of return calculations under various different terminologies for some
years, nevertheless the calculation of the ERR for Lilongwe in particular, and
IRDPs in general, was particularly critical for reasons explained by Lele:
"Because there are no easy objective criteria by which to judge such
accomplishments as the training of manpower or the development of
administrative abilities, investment in these integrated programs tends to
be judged primarily by the criterion of an acceptable internal rate of
return, calculated on the basis of quantifiable production targets.
These  targets ..... do  not  take  into  account  some  of  the  crucial
complementarities in realizing production objectives - namely the supply
of trained manpower to administer an input delivery system, the
effectiveness of administrative procedures, or the existence of other
physical infrastructure such au roads to facilitate the movement of
inputs. Thus, the larger the proportion of expenditure in a given project
on these latter type of components, the greater appears to be the need for
ambitious production targets to carry the burden of these indirectly
productive  activities ..... This  may  necessitate  setting  ambitious
production targets in the short run, introducing a contradiction in the
project design from the very outset, for such targets may distract the
attention of the project authorities from acquiring and training competent
indigenous staff, from evolving; administrative procedures that will last
long past the stage of donor financing, and from developing effective
working relations with the normal administrative structure."1/
The Lilonawe Calculations
3.    The original phase I appraisal report of Lilongwe (January 1968) estimated
the ERR on the first phase alone, in case it was not extended to the full 13
1/    The Design of Rural Development, op. cit., page 129.



- 56 -
years envisaged, at 9 per cent; and on the full 13-year program at 13 per cent.
The PPAR of this phase (May 1975), in trying to calculate the ex poet ERR,
admitted defeat. "It is not possible to make a sound reassessment at this stage
of the projected economic return to the project." Four factors contributed to
this conclusion: (1) price uncertainty: the price of maize had risen far faster
than the general level of prices but this seemed unlikely to last; (ii) data
uncertainty: area estimates, yield estimates and crop shares were each subject
to a plus or minus error of at least 10 per cent and together the combined error
was estimated at about 40 per cent, compounded when calculations were based on
what was actually happening with what could have happened without it; (iii)
inaccurate baseline data: pre-project figures were too unreliable to justify any
conclusions about what had happened during implementation (a particular problem
as the project gradually developed one unit area after another and each unit was
at a different stage in the process); (iv) attribution problemss it seemed that
yields were growing as rapidly outside the project as within, so it was
impossible to assess how much of the growth inside the project area was the
result of the project. It concludeds 'no convincing evidence is available from
Phase I either to repudiate or to confirm the economic validity of the investment
undertaken.'  It then went on to point to the many non-quantifiable benefits that
were apparent.
4.      The PCR for Phase II (May 1977) did not attempt to calculate an ERR
either, while the PPAR on the basis of some very hypothetical assumptions,
calculated the combined ERR of Phases I and I1 at 8 per cent. Its conclusion was
that "though there is a basis for confidence that the LLDP is moving in the
right direction, not enough is known to say how and why". It considered the
project to be successful "but more so with respect to the changes and innovations
introduced to the farmers and on Government policies and services than with
respect to the original productivity objectives".
S.     Just over a year later the appraisal report for NRDP I, which funded the
consolidation phase of Lilongwe, speculated further about the ERR of Phases I
through III. It thought the yield assumptions used in the last PPAR were too
optimistic and, after saying the appraisal mission was reluctant to quote a
'definitive' figure, it estimated the ERR on all three phases at minus 2 per
cent. It again returned to same problems that earlier attempts to recalculate
the ERR had found. The methodology for the evaluation of incremental benefits
was flawed. It had used as a baseline the yields of 'undeveloped' areas and
compared them with the yields of 'developed' units, even though there was general
agreement that the 'undeveloped' areas had also been benefitting from the general
development that was going on around them. Thus the incremental benefit from the
'developed' units was underestimated and the benefit from the undeveloped areas
escaped the analysis altogether. In addition the appraisal report claimed that
yields would have declined without the project (although this was not the
experience of other areas where there was no project). Despite these doubts, the
ERR for the consolidation (fourth) phase alone, treating the costs of the other
three phases as sunk costs, was estimated in the appraisal report at 68 per cent.
This high figure is scarcely surprising since the project was largely financing
recurrent costs. The ERR for all four phases together was estimated at 12 per
cent.



- 57 -
6.     The next recalculation of the Lilongwe ERR was in the PCR  of Phase III
(April 1981) just over two years after the appraisal report of NRDP I. This
report made no attempt to calculate the ex post ERR of Phase III in isolation
from the earlier phases. It recalculated the benefits over the whole program
from 1968 both for a 20-year and a 30-year projtct life. The ERRe came out
respectively at 24 and 25 per cent. The assumptions made seemed reasonable at
t'e time.  The results tended also to bear out the calculations of NRDP I
benefits that showed dark-fired tobacco VsA becoming a more important source of
project benefit than maize, even though it was only grown on around 10 per cent
of the project area, compared with over 80 per cent of the area grown to maize.
(Unfortunately I do not have the relevant pages of the PCR - Annex VIlIc - so I
cannot comment in more detail but it would be useful to follow up this point
about tobacco). The PPAR accepted these figures without comnent.
7.    The PCR on NRDP I, which included the final phase of Lilongwe, also found
it impossible to recalculate the ERR due to serious data limitations although it
said it was clear that results were substantially below expectations.   For
Lilongwe it speculated that the ERR was probably in the range of 5-10 per cent
(presumably for th^ fourth phase only) although this does not take into account
the fact that the tncremental maize production had come at the expense of a
reduction in 'othe- crops', the tcotal crop area remaining unchanged.
8.    Although the present audit mission did not attempt to recalculate the ERR
yet again, it was clear that the projections used to arrive at any of the ERR
figures have turned out to be incorrect.   In the first place the level of
extension serviceX support has not been maintained at project levels once external
funding ceased.  Secondly, the tobacco area, the main source of benefits assumed
in the PCR, which had been forecast to be 27,400 hectare in 1989/90, was actually
only 7,300 hectare and tobacco yields were lower than those assumed for the
without project situation. On the other hand average maize yields in the late
1980s did seem to be higher than in the early project years. This was not,
however, due to increased areas of hybrid maize but to fertilizers or, local
maize.
The Karonaa Calculations
9.    The Ek. calculations for Karonga I depended upon the successful expansion
of rice production. The appraisal report forecast etn expansion of just over
5,000 tons over the project life. The PCR calculated the actual increase at
4,800 tons. This figure was arrived at by taking the rice area brought under the
project 'schemes', assuming that without the schemes only 50 per cent of this
area was cropped and attributing the increase to the project, plus a small
increase in yields in the scheme areas over the non-scheme. This implied an
increase in the rice area of 2,860 hectare. All the evidence indicates that no
such increase occurred, though it is impossible to check it because total area
figur,  were not presented in the PCR or the appraisal report.   All the
calculations were based on incremental scheme areas. A good indication, however,
is given by farmer sales of rice to ADMARC. These had been increasing steadily
over the late 19609 and in the last pre-project year had reached 5,600 tons.  In
the four project years used in the PCR to calculate the ERR they averaged 6,600
tons, an increase of only 1,000 tons. There was no sign of any increasing trend
in sales during these four years as there would have been if rice area and

production had been growing in the way the PCR assumed, particularly since the
producer price for rice offered by ADMARC was attractive and increased by over
one-third during the project period.
10.     The 6 per cent ERR that resulted from these calculations seems greatly
inflated. One project component, that for irrigated rice, suffered a very large
cost overrun, and the PCR calculated that without this component the ERR would
have been 33 per cent, leading to the conclusion that the project had a very high
rate of return and that it was "also of considerable value to the economy". This
conclusion is de-andent on the rice price that it is appropriate to use. Very
shortly after this PCR was written a Bank agricultural sector mission wrote that
"'the expansion of rice production involves a net loss to the economy, as ADHARC's
prices have implied subsidies of 50-90 per cent. If producers in Karonga were
given the actual farmgate equivalent export parity price, they would not produce
rice."2/
II.   So was the Karonga Project of value to the economy or not? The PCR stated
that the crop prices were the actual import and export parity prices for each
individual year on the basis of figures supplied by ADMARC and IBRD. These were
not quoted but they can be found in the next PCR (of Phase II). For rice in
1976/77 the economic farm gate price according to ADMARC was MK170 per ton,
equivalent to about MRKlO per ton of paddy, or just about ADMARC's farm producer
price. The Bank mission calculated the export parity price for paddy for that
year in Karonga at MIIR or one-tenth the ADMARC producer price. At this price
the project would never have been approved by the Bank in the first place. Even
the PCR agrees that ADMARC was making a loss in exporting rice at its own
so-called export parity price and the clearly stated objective of the project was
to produce rice for export.
12.     The appraisal report for Phase II calculated that the ERR for the part
of the project related to Karonga/Chitipa would be 14 per cent if the cost of
those components that could not be quantified, (research, health, evaluation and
livestock, about one-third of costs) were excluded from the calculation. The PCR
prepared by the Government recalculated the ERR ex post using the same
assumptions about costs and arrived at an ERR of 33 per cent. After review by
the Bank commenting on the contradictory nature of the data on crop areas and
yields, and in addition requesting that actual export/import parity prices be
used in the analysis not those projected at appraisal, the ERR was reduced to
14 per cent. This apparently satisfactory result still concealed the fact that
the calculation was subject to a very high margin of error for the same reasons
as pointed out in the case of Lilongwe: (i) the accuracy of the data base was
admitted to be low and different sources of data gave different results; this
was compounded by uncritical acceptance of clearly implausible data (e.g. a rice
production increase of 120 per cent between 1979/80 and 1980/81 compared with an
actual decline in ADMARC rice purchases); (ii) even within the PCR there are
different figures for the incremental maize area in Chitipa (march of the
confusion appears to result from the use of the scheme versus non-scheme

methodology of calculating incremental area and production)I (iii) the same
attribution problem as in Lilongwe, crediting to the project production increases
that were the result of price policy. For instance, in the Highlights of the
PCR, commenting on the favorable 14 per cent ERR, was the following statement:
"This success compares very favorably to other Rural Development Projects in East
Africa having similar design. The critical factor was probably the relatively
favorable agricultural policy environment in Malawi, particularly price policy
for rice and maize." Thee main determinant of the ERR was in fact the price of
rice since the expected benefits from maize did not materialize so that in the
ex post calculation of the ERR three-quarters of crop benefits came from
rice.3/
13.    In the PCR for Phase III the earlier methodology of comparing, scheme and
non-scheme production to arrive at the incremental production resulting from the
project Was abandoned.   The result of this was that every change in crop
production that occurred during the project life was attributed to the project
regardless of causality. For instance the production impact of the 68 per cent
increase in maize price in 1981/82 was all counted towards project benefits. Two
PCRs were prepared for Phase II, one by the Government and another by staff of
the PAO/World Bank Cooperative Program for the Bank. In the PCR prepared by the
Government the ERR was calculated -n the crop components only, the data on the
livestock and forestry components being reportedly inadequate to include in the
analysis. It was calculated at 24 per cent. In the PCR prepared for the Bank
the ERR, again for the crop components only, was calculated at -0.1 per cent, "as
a result of heavy front-end investment costs and shortfalls in production
targets".   The ERR in the appraisal report had been 19 per cent.   Both
calculations were based on the same production statistics except that the PCR
prepared for the Bank included actual figures for one more year.
14.    Neither PCR mentions what costs were included in the analysis but imply
that it was only the crop-related ones. It seems clear that if two reports
prepared on the same set of basic data can come up with such different results
the reliability of either ERR is at least questionable. In the Borrower's review
of the PCR prepared for the Bank the only comnent on this difference is that the
inclusion of the extra year's actual production could be misleading because it
Was a drought stricken season.
15.   A closer look at the basic assumptions made in calculating the ERR in both
reports indicates that neither calculation takes into account the available data.
The PCR prepared for the Bank cautions that this ERR is "indicative only because
the unexplained sharp increase in production in the first year of the project,
particularly of maize, would appear to indicate that the without project area and
production figures in the appraisal report were materially underestimated." In
fact both calculations used the appraisal report without project baL eline figures
(which were underestimated) without looking at the actual production figures for
3/    The export parity price of rice was no longer a significant issue by the
late 1980s. ADMARC purchases of rice in Karonga fell steadily during the
decade reaching a low of 2,200 tons in 1987/88 ant] national rice exports
also dwindled to less than 700 tons annually between 1983 and 1987.

the pre-project situation, which had not been available at the time the appraisal
report was written. Had they used the much more recent figures available from
the Project Evaluation Unit the results would have been quite different. For
instance the PCR for Phase II (with figures derived from the Evaluation Unit)
shows that the 'with project'  (i . e.   the Phase III pre-project) maize
production in KRronga District averaged over 6,?30 tons from 1977/78 to 1980/81,
while the appraisal report uses a figure of 2,880 tons as the baseline
production. No figures are available for 1981/82 (RRDP's data base only starts
from 1982/83) but the first year's estimate of maize production in Karonga
District for Phase III in both PCRs is a seemingly reasonable 7,984 tons
(particularly in view of the producer price rise) giving an increment of 5,104
tons over the appraisal estimate but only about 1,750 tons over the actual
average production of the preceding years.   The lower figure seems more
plausible. Similar discrepancies exist in the other crop increments assumed.
Adjusting the figures to take account of a more realistic baseline would make the
ERR substantially negative.

PROJECT PERFORMANCE AUDIT
ANNEX II
PRODUCTION AND YIELD DATA
1.      This annex brings together the available data on crop production and
yields in the Lilongwe Land Development Program area, the Karonga Rural
Development Program area and the NRDP IV areas from the time of the start of
project implementation until the present. Although the data come from different
sources and are subject to a considerable margin of error, it is believed that
a 15-20 year picture of production and yields will show the general trend of what
has happened without having to be precise about the exactness of a particular
reading in a particular year.
Lilonswe Data
2.    The production of the three main crops in the LLDP area, from the time the
area was fully covered by the Program, shows that there have been big increases
in maize production with large fluctuations in the production of groundnuts and
tobacco.

3.     The major jump in maize production between 1981/82 and 1982183 was the
result of a large increase in the producer price paid by ADIAC. It was achieved
by a switch from 'other crops' to maizo (PCR MtDP I page 25).
4.       Yield data for maize and groundnuts shaws that there has been no
consistent increase in the yields of either crop over the past 20 years. All the
increases in production in the above table are the result of increases in crop
area and not yields. The following table presents the yield dats.

change in maize yields is +2.2 per cent for the full 20 year period, or 1.1 per
cent for the period ending 1984/85. The figures for the final four years appear
implausibly high. The latter growth figure is not statistically different from

comparable but they show the overall pattern clearly. The figures for rice begin

rice production from the start of Implementation of Phase I until the end of
Phase II followed by a levelling off during Phase II; (ii) no clear trend in
maize production; (lii) no apparent increase in groundnut production until the

increase in cotton from a very low base as this was a new crop for the area.

yield trends are negative for both Karonga District (-1.3 per cent) and Chitipa

maize wva  the main crop, accounting for 63 per cent of expected benefits at full
development in LNE and 90 per cent in DH. In LNE tobacco was the other important
crop, accounting for just over 30 per cent of! expected benefits. Groundnuts,
which had not been an important crop before the project, grew rapidly in both
sub-project areas in response to favorabl, prices during implementation. The

The DH figures for 1989/90 are available but not with me.
11.    The table shows that maize production in LNE grew rapidly during project
implementation.   This was, however, the result of increased area not higher
yields and owes little to the project. The production of tobacco grew rapidly
in the early years but further increases were blocked by quota problems (Is this
correct?).   The increase in groundnuts was considerable up to 1987/88.  The
reduction in the last two years was the result of drought in 1988/89, with a
knock-on effect reducing seed availability in 1989/90.   In DH there was no
consistent trend in maize production.
12.    The data on crop yields are presented in the table below.

These figures show once again than there is no apparent impact of the project on
crop yields, which are much more influenced by seasonal factor. such as rainfall
than by increased fertilizer use or improved varieties.
