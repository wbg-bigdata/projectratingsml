                             RESTRUCTURING PAPER

A.     SUMMARY

1.      This restructuring paper seeks your approval to proceed with the extension of the
DRC Private Sector Development and Competitiveness Project’s (PSDCP) closing date
by 6 months, from December 31, 2012 to June 30, 2013. The 6 month extension was
approved in principle by RVP on October 17, 2012, conditional upon fulfillment of prior
actions which have now been satisfied, enabling the transfer of certain activities of high
corporate reputation risk to other Bank projects for continuation and completion of their
implementation. These include (i) an activity of the Management Action Plan (MAP)
approved by the Board in May 2011 in response to an Inspection Panel request on behalf
of ex-workers of the mining enterprise Gecamines who took part in a Project-supported
labor retrenchment program in 2004-5, and (ii) a critical phase of the National Payments
System (NPS) implementation at the Central Bank of Congo (BCC). The extension of
closing date would allow the Project to make up for the time lost due to disruptions
caused by election related political instability from mid-2011 to January 2012, including
a period of one and a half months when the Country Office was closed and all staff
evacuated. This is the second extension of the Project, pushing its cumulative extension
to 39 months and age to 9 years and 11 months at closing.

B.     PROJECT STATUS

2.      The PSDCP of US$120 million was approved on July 29, 2003, and became
effective on December 2, 2003. The Project Development Objective (PDO) is to support
the Borrower’s policy of the promotion of private-sector led growth through: (a)
improving the investment climate; (b) supporting parastatal reform in the
telecommunications, energy, finance, transport, and mining sectors; and (c) improving
mining competitiveness in the Katanga region of the Borrower.

3.      In April, 2008, a US$60 million Additional Financing was approved. The purpose
of this Additional Financing was to finance the costs associated with the scaling up of
two existing project components: (i) Improving the Investment Climate and (ii)
Implementing the Parastatal Reform. The PDO has not been changed as part of the
extension of the Additional Financing. An extension of the Project closing date from
March 31, 2010 to December 31, 2012 was also approved.

4.      As the first operation of the Bank’s re-engagement in conflict-ridden Democratic
Republic of Congo (DRC) to tackle reform of the industrial and financial sector, the
PSDCP has pursued an ambitiously challenging agenda in an environment of limited
absorption capacity, with weak political and economic governance, amidst military
conflict and nationwide security concerns, and compounded by an outdated legal
framework and political culture that was unprepared for rapid modernization of the
economy. Difficulties in creating an enabling environment for development of private


                                            1
sector were engrained in colonial-era legislation, weak rule of law, and passive resistance
to reforms rooted in decades of economic mismanagement of the country’s immense
natural wealth amidst extreme poverty of the majority of Congolese society.

5.      The first Project-supported reforms of the large SOEs included labor retrenchment
programs, such as the Voluntary Departure Program carried out at Gecamines in 2004-5,
to reduce surplus employment and allow room for debt reduction, improved governance,
and modern legal and organizational structures that would be conducive and attractive to
private sector-provided investment capital and management know-how. While initially
welcomed by all stakeholders, on the back of Government’s legislative and executive
leadership of the implementation process, this restructuring scheme backfired in 2009
when aggrieved ex-workers who initially had supported the reforms, reneged on prior
agreements with the Government and demanded entitlement to additional monetary
compensation from the Government, from the Bank, and from the enterprise, eventually
appealing to the Bank’s Inspection Panel. Following the Panel’s acceptance of the Board-
approved MAP in 2011 and during the MAP’s implementation, which took place during a
period of intense political instability and election-related diversions which caused loss of
reform discipline and progress, the dialog between the Bank, Government and Panel case
stakeholders carried on with completion of the requisite financial and legal studies.

6.      However, one activity of the MAP that is currently in progress, the 2 years
entitlement to free health and education access to eligible Gecamines ex-workers’
families, will not finish before June 2014, well beyond the time-bounds of the PSDCP.
On October 17, 2012 Bank management issued approval in principle to extend the
PSDCP by 6 months to allow an orderly transfer of this activity to a more suitable Bank
operation, the Primary Health Care Project, PARSS (P126088), preconditioned on its
effectiveness and an appropriate formal Government request. The PARSS, with closing
date of June 30, 2014, became effective on November 30, 2012. Its team has facilitated
the takeover of the MAP component through technical support of its design. The transfer
of the MAP activity to PARSS was formally requested by the Government on December
7, 2012.

7.      The project has broadly achieved the majority of its outcome indicators, as
reflected in surpassed targets for annual Foreign Direct Investment (FDI) volumes across
key industry sectors (was US$4 billion v. target of US$1 billion), growth in total
domestic credit to private sector to 7.66% of GDP (v. target of 4.8% by 2011), and
increase in total savings (M3) in financial sector at 12.69% of GDP in 2010 (vs target of
10.4% by 2011). Supporting these outcomes are achievements in reduction of cost of
doing business, as reflected in 70% reduction in number of days to register a business, in
the application of specialized courts and arbitration centers to enforce business contracts,
by the explosive growth of microfinance industry (over 700,000 accounts vs target
300,000), improved compliance with prudential framework by commercial banks due to
better supervision capacity and privatization, and transformation of the large SOEs into
viable corporate entities.

8.   Although progress on all fronts was disrupted from mid-2011 until installation of
a new Government in mid-2012 which led to a temporary downgrading of

                                             2
implementation performance to Moderately Unsatisfactory, strong implementation
achievements by the new government since June 2012 have significantly improved the
performance and outlook of this project across all components, in stark contrast with lack
of forward movement during the political elections period. Major breakthroughs
occurred under the Project that unblocked core reforms across the SOE agenda,
investment climate, and financial sector, and are contributing to sustained improvement
in economic growth, competitiveness, and Project performance, whose rating is now
Moderately Satisfactory and continues to improve:

       a.     Government-led implementation of a corporate debt resolution framework
              for SOEs, including the settlement of accumulated claims by organized
              labor, has produced first cases of successfully transformed SOEs into
              commercially viable corporate entities, with restated accounts and updated
              valuations of capital contributing to restoration of solvency, and
              facilitating the transition to private sector governance with management
              and regulatory structures conducive to Public-Private Partnership
              arrangements;

       b.     A series of high-impact reforms has propelled improvements in
              investment climate and financial sector, including adoption of a new
              commercial legal framework of OHADA, redoubled commitment to
              enacting the NY Convention on Arbitration and implementing a pilot One
              Stop Shop for business registration targeting 3 day processing, as part of
              comprehensive reform program on fronts of investment climate
              championed personally by the Prime Minister;

       c.     Central Bank-led strengthening of bank regulation, microfinance sector
              supervision, reinforced with promotion of financial literacy, consumer
              protection, mobile banking, and further supported by establishment of a
              credit registry and completed construction of a payments data center to
              house the new Payments System;

       d.     Government’s successful liberalization of the insurance sector,
              introduction of leasing, streamlining of the tax code, and improvements in
              enforcement of commercial contracts, thereby contributing to improved
              access to finance for improved economic competitiveness.

9.     As of December 2012, the initial credit is about 97 percent disbursed, while about
65 percent of the Additional Financing has been disbursed. The PDO and Overall
Implementation Progress (IP) ratings were lowered in June 2012 in recognition of the
prolonged reform paralysis and lack of political leadership in DRC at a time of national
and local elections, during which there was social unrest and military hostilities that
disrupted Project performance and even caused the evacuation of Bank country office in
DRC. The Project suffered some PIU staff turnover during this period, causing
temporary slippage of ratings for both Procurement and Monitoring and Evaluation
(M&E) to “moderately satisfactory?. However, the Project’s Financial Management
performance is rated as “satisfactory? (financial audits are routinely issued with no

                                            3
qualification and there are no overdue audit reports), and in December 2012, both the
PDO and IP ratings were upgraded to “moderately satisfactory?.

10.     The requirements of OP/BP13.30 (Closing Dates) are met, specifically, (i) the
project objectives continue to be achievable; (ii) the performance of the Borrower (and of
the executing agency) are satisfactory; (iii) the team agrees with the Government's plan
for completing the project; and (iv) there are no outstanding audits, or IFRs for the credit
and grant.

C.     PROPOSED CHANGES

Components

11.     This restructuring is driven by the need to avert reputation risks associated with
premature termination of support to two activities (MAP and NPS) under the Project,
until they can be effectively transferred to other Bank operations. Neither activity alters
the existing structure of the Project in terms of categories and components. The first
activity, an integral task of the MAP, is funded under the CR3815, while the NPS is
funded by the AF grant H3660. All activities that will continue with implementation
during the period of Project extension are consistent with the Project structure and
support the existing results framework.

12.     The MAP, as approved by the World Bank’s Board of Executive Directors in May
2011, included actions to (i) address the critical issues raised by the requestors in their
three requests to the Inspection Panel, and (ii) further improve the quality of the overall
Bank’s portfolio in DRC in connection with social and other aspects of public sector
reform including SOEs and public administration. The case-specific critical issues raised
by the requestors to the Inspection Panel were to be addressed by customized (a) action
plan for the Gecamines ex-workers who seceded to apply under the Voluntary Departure
Program (VDP), and (b) an action plan for the former workers of the three liquidated
banks (BCA, BCCE, NBK) and of the Office of Congo Post and Telecom (OCPT). The
overall portfolio issues were to be addressed by application of lessons learned to
forthcoming retrenchment and other social plans to be applied to SOEs or civil service
and public administration, and by support to the Government to develop a comprehensive
strategy to settle social debts of SOEs. More specifically, the activities in support of the
item (i) above included:

       a.      Provision of education support to eligible children of Gecamines VDP up
               to end of secondary education or age of cutoff to be agreed, along with
               free access to health care (through an NGO) for eligible family members
               of the Gecamines VDPs, for up to two years, accompanied by
               participatory Monitoring and Evaluation of the education and health
               programs;

       b.      Support to the Gecamines VDPs and former employees of the three
               liquidated banks to reinstate their rights to the pension system, including



                                             4
               the calculation of contributions to and entitlements from the social
               insurance agency (INSS); and


       c.      Reinforcement of institutions responsible for effective administration of
               the social dimension of public enterprise reform, including reform of the
               INSS, future retrenchment and reinsertion programs, and communications
               support.

13.     As of December 2012, all above activities had achieved sufficient progress except
the two-year program of free health care and education benefits extended to families of
the 10,600 ex-workers of Gecamines, which officially started only after arrival of the new
Government in June 2012, after an exhaustive process was completed during 2011 to
finalize the census and demographic data/eligibility verification involving a population of
over 60,000 people, as well as the census and audit/accreditation of over 100 health
clinics throughout the country and over 100 educational institutions with whom
covenants had to be signed and financial settlements system agreed. Moreover, until this
process was completed, it was not possible to complete the recruitment of NGOs and
audit firms who would manage the execution and fiduciary aspects of the operation, nor
to formalize agreements with government agencies during a period of political transition,
lack of government attention and authority, compounded by high security concerns on the
ground during the DRC election period in second half of 2011 which particularly affected
movement across Katanga province where the majority of Gecamines ex-workers are
located. Additionally, the Bank project to which this MAP activity was to be transferred
(PARSS) had to be restructured with Additional Financing and a 2 year extension
enabling it to fully absorb this activity, which was achieved in June 2012, and made
effective, which was done in November 2012.

14.    The NPS is a complex technological undertaking requiring sophisticated
technology architecture, scarce professional skills, legal reforms in banking laws and
harmonization with regional economic blocks like Southern African Development
Community (SADC) and the Common Market for Eastern and Southern Africa
(COMESA), a reorganization and re-staffing of the Central Bank, special data security
and counter-intelligence safeguards, construction of new data center facility equipped
with appropriate telecommunications, security, climate and other fail-safe features, and
all of this having to be not only carefully designed with substantial stakeholder
consultations, but executed in synchronized manner, integrated and interconnected, and
thoroughly subjected to rigorous testing over time before being accepted as completed.
The integrity and stability of the DRC’s monetary payments system is at stake if the
process is not executed with utmost precision and delicate care to the key success factors.

15.     Since its launch under the Project’s AF grant approved in late 2008, and
envisioned for a 3 year implementation timeframe due to DRC’s virtually non-existent
capacity platform to handle such a massive undertaking, the NPS project has progressed
at a staggered pace, affected by delays at each key decision step, due to difficulty in both
attaining full stakeholder consensus, as well as affected by national political crises,
elections, and other fast-evolving situations in the financial system of the country,

                                             5
including fast growth of the banking system at a time when large banks were also failing
or in danger of failure. The NPS program design process quickly used up all time
contingencies available within the current Project timeframe, and is currently locked in a
sensitive phase of finalization of technical specification packages and evaluation of
market solutions, which requires continuity without interruption.

16.     This stage of the NPS has taken longer than envisioned due to complications and
delays in the construction of the Central Bank’s data center facilities during 2011-12
(triggering updates to technical specifications for procuring Payment System components
worth an estimated $12 million). As things stand, the Project will sustain the continuity of
this process up to the final specification of technical architecture and the evaluation of
alternative solutions on the market, while deferring the completion of procurement and
installation of the NPS technology, laws and organizational aspects, including staff
training, to another Bank project scheduled for approval in first quarter of FY14
(Financial Sector and/or Growth Pole project).

Closing Date

17.    The closing date will be extended from December 31, 2012 to June 30, 2013.

18.     The proposed extension is necessary to avert reputation damage from non-
completion of activities considered as pivotal to preserving the Bank's and Government's
credibility, both in terms of social impact as well as integrity of DRC financial payments
systems operations and its connectivity with regional trade partners. More specifically,
the extension is duly needed to effectively mitigate corporate risks by achieving (a)
diligent transfer of a key activity of the MAP which will not be completed until June
2014 to the PARSS operation, which closes on June 30, 2014; and (b) orderly closure,
with improved outcomes, predicated upon provision of technical support to the
modernization of the National Payments System (NPS), whose evaluation of alternative
technical architecture requires continuous uninterrupted quality assurance under a
contractual arrangement which will extend beyond the current closing date of the project.

19.     This will be the second extension of the project, following an earlier extension of
33 months for Additional Financing approved in 2008. The current extension of six
months will make the closing date of June 30, 2013 to be cumulatively 39 months from
the original closing date of March 31, 2010.

Implementation Schedule

20.     Implementation of the above activities already in progress will continue until
Project closure in June 2013, at which time all work under the Project will cease except
for the two activities (MAP and NPS) that will be transferred to other Bank projects. A
reallocation is planned in early 2013 of PSDCP funds remaining from Credit Nos. 3815
and H3660 that will include the cancellation and transfer of IDA funds to other Bank
projects as appropriate. Accompanying the transfer of the MAP component to PARSS
will be a commensurate degree of supervisory support, with the understanding that
overall reporting accountability for the full MAP will be retained by the PSDCP team.

                                             6
21.     In addition, the Project will sustain until its closure the technical support to
dialogue with the Government on issues contained in the economic governance matrix of
the Bank, Government and the IMF, which aims to improve transparency and public
accountability in the extractive industries, and specifically through continued SOE
reforms, including reinforcement of legal and ethical aspects of corporate governance for
the stakeholders of SOEs at Board and management level. Similarly sustained until June
2013 will be programs to improve economic competitiveness, including entrepreneurship
capacity building, with priority given to ex-workers benefitting from the MAP, ongoing
investment climate reforms (including land and labor law reform, family law reform to
promote gender equality in business, and other aspects of the Prime Minister's Doing
Business reform agenda), the operations of the National OHADA Commission, the
Special Economic Zones regulatory commission, the Central Bank's banking supervision
department, and the finalization of construction of three specialized commercial courts,
including two in Eastern DRC where progress has been tenuous due to recent outbreak of
military action.
