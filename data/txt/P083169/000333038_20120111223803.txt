1. Project Context, Development Objectives and Design
1.1 Context at Appraisal

1. Country and sector issues

The HIV/AIDS situation in Bhutan: It has been recognized that increasing cross-border
migration and international travel has made the Kingdom of Bhutan pervious to
HIV/AIDS despite its geographical isolation. At the end of 2001, there were 100
Bhutanese living with HIV/AIDS (less than 0.01% adult prevalence rate), but the number
of reported new infections was on the rise, and the majority of them were acquired
through unprotected sex. The country had risk factors and conditions that could have
fueled the spread of the virus: neighboring countries with generalized or concentrated
epidemics, high mobility across borders and within the country, high levels of sexually
transmitted infections (STIs), relaxed sexual norms, existence of sex work, limited access
to condoms, and an emerging problem of substance abuse.

While Bhutan was considered to be at the early stages of a low-grade HIV epidemic, it
did not appear to conform to the typical pattern of the HIV epidemic in Asia where the
spread of HIV is initially driven by commercial sex and injecting drug use (IDU).
Commercial sex work in Bhutan appeared limited and was focused in border towns.
Injecting drug use was also believed to be limited. However, non-paid casual sex was
common among long distance drivers, armed forces, migrant workers and drug users.
These behaviors tended to occur in specific locations (e.g. bars, restaurants, vegetable
markets) and events (e.g. festivals). At the time of appraisal, information on the nature of
casual sex behaviors in Bhutan remained limited and required more extensive
investigation to inform HIV control efforts.

National Response: In 1988, five years before the detection of the first HIV infection, the
Royal Government of Bhutan (RGOB) established the National STD/AIDS Control
Program (NACP) in the Ministry of Health (MOH), under the Department of Public
Health with two full time staff members. The Information and Communications Bureau
(ICB), which is responsible for IEC, and the Royal Institute of Health Sciences, which
provides basic training to mid-level health workers, also provide input into the national
program. In 2002, the multisectoral task forces (MSTFs), with members from key local
government departments, private sector and civil society, were established in all
dzongkhags with the mandate to carry out health promotion and HIV/AIDS awareness.
They served as an important mechanism to ensure involvement of key sectors beyond
health and the public sector in HIV/AIDS prevention efforts.

The development partners, including DANIDA and UN agencies such as WHO, UNICEF,
UNDP and UNFPA, had been working closely with the Royal Government in the health
sector, including on HIV/AIDS prevention and control efforts. DANIDA had
strengthened the health infrastructure and information systems, and WHO had provided
both technical and financial assistance to the country's HIV/AIDS prevention program



                                             1
that included short-term consultants in the areas of sentinel surveillance and health
education as well as financing travel to conferences and to global and regional events.
UNFPA supported development and distribution of national guidelines for contraceptive
services to field staff, and condom procurement. UNDP provided US$200,000 to
strengthen the capacity of the MSTFs in planning and managing dzongkhag-based HIV
prevention and advocacy activities.

RGOB recognized that at this epidemiological juncture, the country had a unique
opportunity to act vigorously, tackling the abovementioned challenges, and effectively
scaling up and accelerating the national response to ensure that the level of infection in
the country remains low.

Key challenges: According to the PAD, at the time of appraisal, Bhutan faced several
issues and challenges in scaling up the HIV/AIDS response, which included (i) the lack
of a national HIV/AIDS strategy; (ii) inadequate information on the nature of the
epidemic and risk factors; (iii) NACP staffing shortages and weak capacity; and (iv)
widespread stigma attached to HIV/AIDS, especially people living with HIV/AIDS
(PLWHA); and (v) the response to HIV/AIDS limited to the health sector instead of a
multi-sectoral approach.

In that context, the following areas were identified as priorities:

(i) Instituting a strategic response and focused prevention: The project was to support the
development of a national HIV/AIDS policy, strengthening of existing institutions for
sustainability, and interventions that will have the highest impact in reducing the spread
of HIV. In a low prevalence setting, such as Bhutan, this would entail HIV/AIDS
prevention interventions for subpopulations having higher rates of sexual partner
exchange or needle sharing, in addition to targeting geographical hot spots.

(ii) Gaining better understanding of the epidemic through improved strategic information
systems: There were little or no systematic data to accurately describe risk behaviors in
the Bhutanese population or assess the potential for HIV spread in the country. A strong
behavioral and sero-surveillance system and monitoring and evaluation strategy would be
financed by the proposed project.

(iii) Strengthening institutions: The project would strengthen NACP in its technical
capacity (a program manager has been recruited), and put in place a project management
team to facilitate NACP and other implementing agencies, which include divisions and
programs within MOH, NGOs/CBOs, dzongkhag authorities, and other line ministries.
Considering human resource constraints in Bhutan, the project would institutionalize a
well-planned and sustained technical assistance and training program.

(iv) Reducing stigma: PLWHA in Bhutan reported a high degree of stigma associated
with HIV/AIDS and fear of disclosure of their status. Care and support was limited with
little or no medical treatment available for HIV/AIDS related diagnoses. The project
would support efforts to reduce stigma and discrimination by: (i) advocacy by opinion



                                              2
leaders to promote positive attitudes towards PLWHA; (ii) providing care and treatment
for PLWHA, including ART; and (iii) involving PLWHA in prevention programs.

(v) Engaging in a multisectoral approach through involvement of key line ministries other
than health and civil society: The project was to promote multisectoral involvement,
among key sectors, such as education, labor, and the armed forces, NGOs and community
based organizations, by setting aside funds for the multisectoral agencies to implement
prevention programs. In addition, the project was to support and strengthen technical and
implementation capacity and increase advocacy to heighten high-level political
commitment in other sectors as well as at central and dzongkhag levels.

2. Rationale for Bank involvement

The Bank was financing HIV/AIDS programs in India, Bangladesh, Sri Lanka, and
Pakistan through both IDA credits and grants. As one of the largest financiers of
HIV/AIDS control programs in the world, the Bank would bring to the fore global and
regional expertise and experience in assisting Bhutan. In addition, the Bank's unique
experience in Bhutan, from analytical work and previous and ongoing investments in
many sectors (i.e. education) would enrich the project design and implementation
strategy. The Bank's involvement would create a higher visibility politically and socially
to the issue of HIV/AIDS and underscore the cross-sectoral development dimension of
HIV/AIDS. Moreover, the Bank would emphasize improving existing national program
to produce the greatest impact, strengthening the capacity of local institutions in the
public and private sectors, and providing regular and sustained implementation support
required for scaling up, enhancing, and accelerating Bhutan's fight against HIV/AIDS and
STIs. Bank assistance would represent the largest source of funds for HIV/AIDS and STI
prevention and control in Bhutan, complementing the financial and technical support
from other development partners.

1.2 Original Project Development Objectives (PDO) and Key Indicators

The project aimed to reduce the risk of HIV and STI transmission among the general
population, in particular among groups with high risk sexual behaviors.

Key outcome indicators were:

        Percentage of persons reporting condom use with last non-regular sex partner
       increased from <20% at project start to 60% among priority groups and 30%
       among the general population at project end; and
        Percentage of patients with selected STIs at health care facilities who are
       appropriately treated accordingly to the updated national guidelines increased
       from <20% in baseline (Year 2) to 60% at project end.

1.3 Revised PDO (as approved by original approving authority) and Key Indicators, and
reasons/justification




                                            3
There was no revision to the PDO or key project indicators. However, a number of
process indicators were informally added in 2005 and they were monitored during project
implementation together with the original indicators.

1.4 Main Beneficiaries

According to the PAD, key beneficiaries would include:
    General population;
       Six priority groups: long distance drivers, migrant workers, commercial sex
      workers, drug users, out-of-school youth and armed forces;
       People living with HIV/AIDS;
       STI patients; and
       National institutions involved in the fight against HIV/AIDS

1.5 Original Components (as approved)

Component 1 – Prevention of HIV/AIDS and STIs (US$ 2.00 million): This component
was to promote political and societal leadership in the fight against HIV/AIDS, improve
community knowledge and attitudes about HIV prevention, promote risk-reducing
behaviors amongst priority groups and increase access to condoms.

Component 2 – Institutional strengthening and building capacity (US$ 1.66 million):
This component was to enhance the ability of national institutions to lead the fight against
HIV through training and technical assistance and to strengthen laboratory and blood
transfusion services.

Component 3 – Care, support and treatment of AIDS and STIs (US$ 1.00 million): This
component was to establish VCT services, strengthen management of STIs and
HIV/AIDS comprehensive care and treatment approach, including introduction of ART)
and improve infection control and waste management in health facilities.

Component 4 - Strategic information for HIV/AIDS and STIs (US$ 1.11 million): This
component was to promote evidence-based decision making by improving health
information management, strengthening operations research capacity and instituting
M&E and second generation surveillance systems.

1.6 Revised Components

There was no revision to the components.

1.7 Other significant changes

Project closing date was extended by 18 months (from December 31, 2009 to June 31,
2011) due to slow disbursement. The objective of project extension was to complete
project activities.

2. Key Factors Affecting Implementation and Outcomes
2.1 Project Preparation, Design and Quality at Entry

The project was prepared in ten months (from July 2003 to April 2004). Positive aspects
of project preparation and design include the followings:

      Project preparation was preceded by a period of policy dialogue, stakeholder
       consultations and technical assistance (June 2002-March 2003) during which a
       technical note „HIV/AIDS Situation in Bhutan‟ was prepared. This period of
       engagement with the RGOB and stakeholders significantly facilitated subsequent
       project preparation.
      Key lessons from HIV/AIDS projects in the region and elsewhere the world were
       taken into account in the project design, including the following: (i) prevention of
       HIV and STIs to be the core of the response in the early stage of the epidemic; (ii)
       prevention and treatment to go hand-in-hand given their biological and social
       synergy; (iii) essential involvement of key stakeholders from public and private
       sectors, civil society and development partners in the HIV/AIDS response; and
       (iv) HIV/AIDS information base to be critical for policy making and planning.
      A social assessment was conducted for PLWHA and five groups deemed to be at
       higher risk for HIV/AIDS (commercial sex workers, truck drivers, migrant
       workers, armed forces and drug users). This qualitative study helped inform the
       project preparation.
      The project made good use of existing national systems rather than setting up new
       institutional arrangements. For example, at appraisal, the Multi-sectoral Task
       Forces (MSTFs) were already in place at the dzongkhag level. Although they
       were not funded or fully operational at the time, MSTF held the promise of a
       multi-sectoral response at the grass-root level. The project design capitalized on
       this by including MSTF in the implementation arrangements.
      There was close collaboration with key development partners (DANIDA, WHO,
       UNFPA and UNICEF) in the preparation of the project.

However, some aspects of project preparation and design could have been improved.
These include the following:

      Although a HIV/AIDS situational analysis was done, the project was prepared in
       the absence of a National HIV/AIDS Strategic Plan (NSP). NSP was formulated
       much later during project implementation (2008). In retrospect, it would have
       been better for the country to develop such a plan first with the support of the
       Bank and other development partners to form the basis for the project preparation.
       That way, project activities could have been formulated as a subset of the NSP
       and the ownership and commitment of the MOH to the project could have been
       increased.
      The project rightly identified a lack of human resource capacity in the MOH as a
       significant implementation risk.        However, the risk mitigation measures
       (recruitment of the Program Manager for NACP, establishment of Project


                                            5
       Management Team) were not adequate. In retrospect, the number of project
       activities could have been reduced and more focused to address this constraint.
      While emphasizing the importance of the information base for decision making,
       the project itself was prepared in the absence of critical data. At appraisal, the
       team did make an effort to utilize all the information available at hand on the
       characteristics of the HIV/AIDS epidemic in Bhutan to form the analytical basis
       for the project. However, data availability was very limited. For example, there
       was no reliable information on the most at risk populations (MARPs), their risk
       behaviors, levels of HIV infection, and the coverage of key interventions among
       them. In retrospect, a baseline quantitative survey to better identify MARPs and
       their characteristics as part of project preparation could have been beneficial to
       project design and the Result Framework.
      At the time of appraisal, the critical roles of civil society organizations (CSOs) in
       providing HIV/AIDS services to MARPs, who are often hard-to-reach and
       marginalized, were well recognized internationally. Although the Project
       Appraisal Document recognized CSOs to be “emerging? and “limited? in Bhutan,
       it did not explicitly identify the lack of CSOs as an implementation risk in order
       to come up with mitigation measures in the project design. The relatively recent
       emergence of CSOs in the country has come about through legislations and a
       regulatory framework governing CSOs. These were methodically introduced over
       a period of time but not in a timely fashion to benefit this operation. As the result,
       the lack of CSOs hindered the delivery of HIV/AIDS services under the project.
      The project did not identify a number of other risks which later materialized and
       manifested themselves as obstacles to project implementation: (i) low
       commitment to targeted interventions for the MARPs; (ii) very high turn-over of
       staff in the MOH and other implementing agencies; (iii) low capacity in
       procurement; and (iv) governance issues.

2.2 Implementation

Despite a slow start, project implementation was on track until mid-2007. An MTR was
conducted in November 2006 which did not identify major issues other than the need to
increase HIV/AIDS interventions for MARPs and strengthen M&E. From early 2008 to
closing, the project became a problem project at several points in time. Although there
was no formal project change or restructuring, the work plan was significantly modified
in 2009 to avoid duplication with the Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis and
Malaria (GFATM) activities. As the result, most of the multi-sectoral activities were no
longer supported by the project.

Positive factors and events which influenced project‟s achievements:

      More funding for HIV/AIDS from the Global Fund: In February 2008, the
       GFATM approved a grant of US$ 2.44 million for Bhutan‟s application „Scaling-
       up HIV prevention services among youth and other vulnerable population groups
       through multi sectoral approach‟ under Round 6. The GFATM grant represented




                                             6
       a significant increase in available resources for HIV/AIDS in the country and had
       the potential to compliment the project funding for better results in HIV/AIDS.
      Commitment of Bhutan‟s Royal Family to the fight against HIV/AIDS: The Royal
       Family demonstrated a high level of commitment to HIV/AIDS control. Their
       highly visible involvement in HIV/AIDS public events and campaigns generated
       good advocacy which worked in the project‟s favor.
      Commitment of implementers at the grass root level: Implementers at the grass
       root level also demonstrated a high level of commitment to the project as well as
       to the response to HIV/AIDS in general.
      The significant increase in the global knowledge on what works in HIV/AIDS:
       For the early HIV/AIDS projects funded by the Bank, the evidence base on what
       works in HIV/AIDS was rather limited. On the contrary, the Bhutan HIV/AIDS
       project was implemented in more favorable environment in which there was a
       significant increase in the global and regional knowledge on HIV/AIDS, both
       from the biomedical and operational points of view.

Negative factors and events which influenced project‟s achievements:

      Severe shortage of human resources: This cross-cutting constraint was identified
       at appraisal as a significant project risk. However, the proposed mitigation
       measures (recruitment of the program manager for NACP, the establishment of
       the Project Management Team or PMT) were inadequate and unable to overcome
       this constraint which existed at various levels of project implementation. Human
       resource constraints were especially prominent in NACP, PMT, the procurement
       team, the Information and Communications Bureau (ICB) as well as in the area of
       Health Care Waste Management.
      Very high turnover of staff at all levels: The above-mentioned shortage of human
       resources was compounded by a very high turnover of RGOB staff and
       consultants working on the project at all levels, including the NACP, PMT, line
       ministry focal points, and the procurement team. For example, during the project
       implementation period there were:
           o five different project coordinators;
           o four changes in the NACP manager position; and
           o three different procurement officers

       In fact, there were periods during which there was no one in charge of the
       program or the project. This problem was exacerbated by poor hand-over
       procedures. Due to the lack of overlap, incoming staff often were not briefed and
       given key project documents by their predecessors. As the result, there was little
       institutional memory of the project in the NACP, PMT and line ministries. This
       severely handicapped project implementation. The Bank team (with only one
       change of task team leader in 2005) was the only factor that remained constant for
       the most part of the implementation period and helped the MOH facilitate
       handovers among their staff by sharing documents.
      Decline in commitment to the project by the MOH leadership: In the second half
       of the project, there were signs of reduced commitment and attention of the MOH


                                           7
    leadership to the project. First, there was the failure to appoint an NACP
    Manager and Project Coordinator for long stretches of time, as noted above.
    Second, when the Project Coordinator position was eventually filled, the MOH
    did not ensure that the person had adequate management skills and experience.
    Third, the MOH did not convene the NAC (which was supposed to meet twice a
    year) in 2010 to provide oversight and guidance for the project. As the result of
    reduced MOH‟s attention, project management was affected after mid-2007.
    Project management, especially with regard to coordination, procurement and
    M&E was particularly inadequate in the last four years of project implementation
    (out of a total of seven years).
   NACP‟s very limited technical support to implementers at lower levels. NACP
    was supposed to be the glue that holds the national HIV/AIDS program together,
    as well as act as the provider of technical support and guidance to various
    implementers. However, NACP‟s leadership role did not fully materialize during
    project implementation due to a shortage of human resources in NACP as well as
    a lack of MOH‟s facilitation for NACP to fulfill its role. As the result,
    implementers especially in the other line ministries and in the dzongkhags
    received very little technical advice and almost no supervision by NACP.
   Lack of NGOs/CSOs as service providers: Elsewhere, it has been demonstrated
    that NGOs/CSOs can be very effective implementers of targeted interventions for
    MARPs. In fact, they have been shown to be better at reaching out to
    marginalized groups such as CSWs, MSM, etc. than government actors.
    Unfortunately, civil society is only nascent in Bhutan and their role has been very
    limited. This greatly hindered the implementation of targeted interventions for
    marginalized MARPs. However, this constraint was beyond the scope of the
    project to address given Bhutan‟s political economy at the time.
   Delayed coordination between the GFATM grant and the World Bank-financed
    project: GFATM funding, while a positive development as discussed above, also
    had untoward effects on the Bank-financed project for two key reasons. First, the
    work program of the GFATM grant was not well coordinated with the World
    Bank-financed project which resulted in duplications of activities, especially in
    2008. This problem was flagged by the Bank team and was subsequently
    corrected in 2009. As a result, the support for multi-sectoral activities was no
    longer included under the project from 2009 onward as they became part of the
    GFATM-financed work program. Second, with the increase in funding and the
    workload, the absorptive capacity of the country was exhausted. This contributed
    to slow disbursement of both the Bank- and GFATM financed activities.
   RGOB‟s investigation of corruption in the MOH: During the last two years of the
    project, the MOH was subject to audits by the Royal Audit Authority (RAA) and
    investigations by the Anti Corruption Commission (ACC) after a series of articles
    in national newspapers in 2009 alleged irregularities in procurement practices in
    the ministry. Due to the RGOB‟s inquiry, both the incumbent and the previous
    head of the procurement unit were temporarily suspended. This left the MOH
    procurement team severely understaffed.
   Limited targeting of most at-risk groups with preventive interventions: Although
    targeted preventive interventions for high risk groups were featured in the PDO


                                         8
        and project design, the implementation of such interventions did not take off in
        earnest during most of the project period. In prevention, there was much a
        stronger focus on information, education and communication (IEC) for the
        general population. This challenge was flagged by the Bank team as early as July
        2005 and consistently raised in the aide-memoires and management letters. The
        Bank team provided support by mobilizing technical assistance in targeted
        preventive interventions for risk groups. Two initiatives – one for IDU
        (implemented by REWA, a NGO) and the other for CSW (by HISC) – made very
        little headway. The IDU initiative ended in February 2008 after less than one
        year of implementation. The CSW outreach program was canceled in December
        2010 due to HISC‟s limited capacity and low commitment by the MOH. In 2010
        and 2011, at the urge of the Bank team, a sexual network study was conducted in
        Bhutan‟s two biggest urban areas of Thimphu and Phuntsholing (with the latter
        being the commercial hub on the southern border with India). On this basis,
        targeted interventions were revived toward the end of the project with pilot
        programs focusing on specific venues (hotels, bars and karaoke clubs) and
        specific population groups (truckers, CSWs) using outreach. However, this came
        too late to make a substantial impact under the project.

2.3 Monitoring and Evaluation (M&E) Design, Implementation and Utilization

M&E Design:

The project design has a strong focus on improving the information base for decision
making in HIV/AIDS with a separate component for this purpose. This very positive
feature was not commonly seen in the first-generation HIV/AIDS projects funded by the
Bank. The project indicators are mostly outcomes in nature, reflecting a deliberate
choice to prioritize higher level results. The methodologies and strategies for data
collection were clearly defined in the PAD. However, there are three key issues with the
M&E design. First, in the Results Framework, the project would need to rely on three
different surveys to generate data for 9 out of 12 project indicators. Each of the surveys
was to be carried out in at least two rounds to monitor progress. The number of surveys
and studies was, therefore, highly ambitious for a small country with limited capacity
such as Bhutan. In particular, the plan to implement three rounds of the general
population survey -- at baseline, midterm and end-of-project -- was excessive for a low-
level epidemic country such as Bhutan and not in line with WHO/UNAIDS guidelines for
second generation surveillance1. Second, the M&E design did not include time-bound
process indicators which could be used on a more frequent basis to monitor project
progress and hold implementers accountable along the lines of “who is responsible for
what output and by when?. As a consequence, the reporting requirements for
implementers at different levels and arrangements for routine monitoring were not


1
  WHO/UNAIDS 2000 Guidelines for Second Generation HIV Surveillance does not recommend
monitoring HIV infection and behaviors in the general population in low level epidemics. Instead it
recommends surveillance systems to focus on most-at-risk groups in such settings,



                                                    9
sufficiently defined in either the PAD or the Operations Manual. Third, baseline data for
several indicators are not reliable. For example, the two PDO indicators and Immediate
Result Indicators No. 1, 7 and 8 would require surveys to generate baseline data.
However, such surveys had not been implemented in Bhutan at the time of appraisal.
Consequently, baseline data in the PAD are unreliable, which, in turn, rendered
corresponding targets unrealistic and not very meaningful.

In the M&E framework, one can infer that the expected outcomes are to be solely
attributable to project inputs and outputs. This is understandable because at appraisal, the
project was the key source of funding for HIV/AIDS in Bhutan. However, during project
implementation, additional resources from GFATM were obtained. In this context, it
should be recognized that GFATM grant contributes to the achievement of the PDOs as
well.

The M&E design is rated as Modest (2 out of 4 point scale).

M&E Implementation:

M&E implementation was a challenge for the project until the very end. Routine data
related to project activities were not collected systematically. There were no standard
reporting formats or reporting schedule for implementers to report project activities back
to the NACP and PMT. There was no information system in the PMT to keep track of
project activities either. In 2005, the project team added 20 new process2 indicators for
the purpose of activity monitoring, although such indicators were not processed formally
to be part of the official Results Framework. While the project could benefit from
additional process indicators, the number of such indicators was excessive and created an
extra burden on the implementing agency which failed to monitor them in a systematic
manner. Subsequently, it fell on the Bank to take the lead in coordinating M&E and data
collection during each mission. The project made little headway in introducing a culture
of information-based planning and decision making. For example, the results of surveys
implemented under the project were not widely disseminated to all implementers as
inputs for their work plans. It was only toward the end of the project that a factsheet was
prepared by the MOH to provide information on key survey findings. Although a large
number of program officers, managers and health workers (641 in total) were trained in
the use of data for management, routine M&E data were not used for providing feedback
to implementers for supervision purposes and/or corrective follow-up.

As discussed above, three major surveys were envisioned by the project, with at least two
rounds per survey. However, due to the limited capacity within MOH, only the following
were carried out:
   -     One round of the HIV/AIDS General Population Survey (GPS) in 2006;



2
  Of the 20 process indicators, two were eventually dropped and 18 remained at project end. Please see the
ICR datasheet for information on the 18 process indicators.



                                                   10
   -     One round of HIV/AIDS Behavioral Surveillance Survey (BSS) for high risk
       groups in 2008;
   -     The first round of the Health Facility Survey (HFS) in 2009; and
   -     The second round of the HFS for a subset of facilities in 2011.

A rapid assessment on sexual networks was conducted in Thimphu (2010) and
Phuntsholing (2011). A retrospective study on the risk factors of HIV/AIDS infections in
Bhutan was also carried out in 2011. All the surveys were implemented late in the
project cycle (around MTR or after), so they could not serve as start-of-project baselines.
Except for the Health Facility Survey, they were not implemented in two rounds;
consequently, it was not possible to gauge progress over time. Some key project
indicators could have been monitored by the surveys, but they were not included in the
survey instruments. For example, the second PDO indicator and process indicator No. 17
could have been monitored by the 2011 Health Facility Survey, but they were not.
Similarly, the Immediate Result Indicator No. 6 could have been monitored by the 2006
GPS and the 2008 BSS, but it was not. This represents a missed opportunity in M&E as
well as a disconnect between the surveys/studies and the Results Framework during
implementation. Nevertheless, the surveys have significantly improved the information
base on HIV/AIDS in Bhutan insofar as they have established baseline data for Bhutan
for the first time. They also provided useful inputs for the development of the 2012-2016
National HIV/AIDS Strategic Plan in Bhutan.

Implementation of M&E is rated as Modest (2 out of 4 point scale).

2.4 Safeguard and Fiduciary Compliance

Safeguards: The project had an Environmental Category B rating. For most of the project
implementation period, compliance with environmental safeguards was rated Moderately
Satisfactory by the Bank team except for the first year of the project when compliance
was deemed Satisfactory. After much delay, most activities in the agreed Health Care
Waste Management (HCWM) Work Plan were carried out. These included development
of HCWM Guidelines and a standardized training module, procurement, distribution of
HCWM equipment and supplies, and training of health care workers in HCWM. Delays
were mostly due to low capacity in both procurement and HCWM. The institutional
arrangements for HCWM did not include fully functioning HCWM committees which,
although established, were not active in all hospitals. Little is known about actual
compliance with environmental safeguards at the facility level as there are no routine
monitoring and evaluation mechanisms in place. The Health Facility Survey in 2009
shows that 65% of facilities complied with national HCWM guidelines. Unfortunately,
the second round of the survey in 2011 did not include HCWM assessment in the survey
instrument.

Financial Management

Generally speaking, project FM arrangements were satisfactory during the life of the
project. These arrangements were mainstreamed into RGoB‟s own country systems
using budgetary, fund flows, internal control and accounting processes. The project‟s


                                            11
financial reports were derived from these systems and proved to be reliable and timely.
However, in the latter part of the project life, several internal control issues were
observed, including the identification of non-project related expenditures during
Statement of Expenses (SOE) and implementation reviews, leading to the rating of the
FM performance to be revised to Moderately Satisfactory.

Similar to other projects in the Bhutan portfolio, grant disbursement was slow. This was
due, in part, to delays in reporting of MSTF expenditures by the dzongkhags.
Dzongkhags are by definition not accountable to the line ministries. This resulted in
difficulties in obtaining financial reports. Oversight by the PMT in the MoH over the use
of project funds for the dzongkhag-level expenditures remained weak.

Disbursement under the project was based on SOEs instead of Interim Unaudited
Financial Reports (IUFR). This required a separate exercise of reconciliation of
expenditures as per books of accounts with withdrawal claims submitted to the Bank by
the Ministry of Finance. Reconciliation did not materialize for the most part of the
project period and most audit reports did not have significant observations by the auditors.

Procurement: The project was procurement-intensive with about 60% of grant proceeds
allocated for the procurement of goods, works and services. Because of five different
entities handling procurement, the procurement planning, monitoring and coordination
became difficult, resulting in delays in the award of contracts from the beginning of the
project period. The PMT, which was to act as nodal agency for the project, could not
reduce the delays despite its best efforts. Such delays in procurement contributed to slow
implementation of various activities such as surveys, BCC activities, the Laboratory
Information System, etc. There were also long periods when the project was without an
updated procurement plan.

Selecting and retaining trained procurement staff was also a major challenge. Even
where trained procurement staffs were available, they were working simultaneously for
many departments and unable to dedicate RGOB procurement procedures were used
instead of agreed Bank procurement procedures. The project also faced problems due to
different procurement procedures of funding agencies, such as the World Bank and the
GFATM. Due to procurement mistakes noted in Bank reviews, misprocurement was
declared in some cases. Problems were also noted in downstream supply chain
management resulting in difficulties in demand forecasting, as well as in monitoring
inventories and record keeping of distributed stocks. There was an overall lack of
standardization, particularly for test kits.

The project would have benefitted from closer Bank guidance and implementation
support for procurement. The Task Team Leader (TTL) did endeavor to obtain this, but
with limited success. For the projects which are handling Bank-financed procurement for
the first time, it is equally important to improve communication between the project team
and the Bank task team so that procedural deviations could be identified and avoided ex-
ante.

2.5 Post-completion Operation/Next Phase

With the closing of the World Bank-financed project, HIV/AIDS activities are being
funded by the Global Fund and RGOB‟s own resources. However, the GFATM grant is
expected to close in 2012, leaving RGOB funding (currently estimated at US$ 0.2m per
year) as the only source of funding for HIV/AIDS. To prepare for the next five-year plan
period, the MOH prepared the Second National Strategic Plan for the Prevention and
Control of STIs and HIV/AIDS (2012-2016) in June 2011. The Strategic Plan aims to
maintain the institutional arrangements for the HIV/AIDS response which were supported
by the project, namely the NAC, NACP, MSTF, selected line ministries, NGOs/CBOS,
etc. The next step would be to cost out the strategic plan to determine the resource
envelope required for the HIV/AIDS response in Bhutan. On that basis, the MOH will
use the cost estimates to mobilize both internal and external resources for the
implementation of the plan.

3. Assessment of Outcomes
3.1 Relevance of Objectives, Design and Implementation

Relevance of PDOs:

The project aimed to reduce the risks of HIV and STI transmission among the general
population and, in particular, among groups with high risk sexual behaviors. At the time
of the ICR, Bhutan remains a very low HIV prevalence country (around 0.2% among
adult aged 15-49 according to UNAIDS estimates), while the neighboring northeastern
Indian states and Nepal have already been experiencing generalized or concentrated
epidemics. The potential cross-border issues in HIV and the importance of intervening
early while HIV prevalence remains low are still applicable. With an estimated number
of 5,000 new cases of STIs per annum, the burden of STI-related morbidity is likely
many times more important than that of HIV, justifying STI control as a public health
priority in its own right. In this context, the objective of reducing the risk of HIV and
STI remains relevant at the time of the ICR.

There is now a general consensus in the area of HIV/AIDS control that in a low
prevalence setting it is critical to improve the coverage and quality of proven
interventions for people whose behavior puts them at high risk of infection, and to
intercept young cohorts of such groups as early as possible before they become infected3.
For this reason, the reference to the general population in the PDO is less relevant, while
the dimension of targeting high risk groups remains highly relevant.

Bhutan has severe constraints in human capacity for HIV/AIDS/STI response. It is
critical to build the country‟s capacity to better respond to HIV/AIDS/STI. While many

                                               13
of the project activities aimed to serve this purpose, capacity building was not reflected in
the PDO.

In summary, the relevance of the PDO is rated as Substantial.

Relevance of design:

The Project has a very comprehensive design with all the elements of a typical national
HIV/AIDS response (prevention, treatment, care and support, institutional strengthening,
capacity building, strategic information, etc.) using a multi-sectoral approach with a
range of implementers inside and outside the health sector at all levels. Although this
comprehensive approach is commonly used in a high prevalence setting, it can still be
relevant for a low level HIV prevalence country with adequate implementation capacity.
However, for a country with both very low HIV prevalence and severe human resource
constraints such as Bhutan, the relevance of this design is not as high. A large number of
components and activities can overwhelm a country‟s implementation capacity. In this
context, a more streamlined design with a stronger focus on interventions for high risk
groups would have been more suitable for Bhutan.

The relevance of design is also impeded by a lack of targeting mechanisms for high risk
groups. Although targeting high risk groups was mentioned as a priority, both the PAD
and the OM did not specify how high risk groups should be identified and targeted.
While almost fifty percent of the people known to be living with HIV/AIDS were from
the capital city, Thimphu, and the largest commercial center on the border with India,
Phuentsholing, there was no explicit geographical targeting in the design.

The relevance of design is somewhere between Substantial and Modest.

Relevance of implementation:

The relatively large number of multi-sector implementers at various levels overstretched
the coordination capacity of the MOH and the PIU. The National HIV/AIDS Program
was staffed by only one full-time person for most of the project implementation period.
This was also the case with the PMT. In this context, managing, coordinating and
monitoring a large program involving six MOH departments/divisions, six non-health
ministries, 20 dzongkhag health authorities and 20 dzongkhag MSTFs as envisioned in
the Operational Manual would be an impossible task. It was very difficult for PMT and
NACP to ensure timely inputs for them, assist in the preparation of annual work plans,
procurement of goods and services, monitoring progress and financial matters, as well as
provide technical inputs. Communications and logistical issues posed great challenges
for the PMT. Consequently, in terms of implementation, the project took decentralization
to the extreme. Implementers, particularly those at the lower levels, planned, budgeted
and implemented their work programs independently with minimal coordination,
technical guidance, support, supervision and monitoring from the central level.




                                             14
There were no specific institutional arrangements for targeted interventions for high risk
groups such as CSWs, IDUs, etc. as envisioned in the PAD and OM. Such interventions
were supposed to be a project priority. Given the dearth of civil society organization, the
project seems to make the assumption that government actors would be the implementers
of such targeted interventions. However, marginalized high risks groups are not the
traditional constituencies of such government bodies (including those at the lower levels
such as the MSTF) and tend to be neglected.

The relevance of implementation is rated Modest.

On balance, the relevance of objectives, design and implementation is rated Substantial.

3.2 Achievement of Project Development Objectives

Assessment of achievement of PDO on the basis of the two outcome indicators

Outcome Indicator 1: Percentage of persons reporting condom use with last non-regular
sex increased from less than 20% at project start to 60% among priority groups and 30%
among the general population at the project end.

While condom use is measured in both the general population and most at risk groups,
the PAD clearly states that in a low prevalence setting like Bhutan, the greatest impact
will be achieved if the target high risk populations are reached with effective
interventions. This reflects also the global consensus in HIV/AIDS control. For this
reason, the coverage of interventions among priority groups is given greater weight.

At appraisal, there were no reliable survey data on condom use in the general population
and high risk groups. The figure used as baseline data in the PAD (namely, less than
20% of condom use) refers to the proportion of condom use among people who used
family planning methods and is health facility based. Therefore, this information is not
suitable as baseline data for this outcome indicator. The lack of reliable baseline data
makes it hard to determine whether the target “60% among priority groups and 30%
among the general population at the project end? was realistic.

During project implementation, condom use was measured in the general population and
high-risk groups. According to the 2006 HIV/AIDS General Population Survey, 74% of
the general population used condoms in last sex with a non-regular partner. According to
the 2008 BSS for the most at risk populations, condom use in last sex with a non-regular
partner was below 60% among female bar workers4 (38%-54%) in both Thimphu and
Phuentsholing and 35% among non-Bhutanese migrant workers in Thimphu. For the
other MARPs, condom use was higher than 60% (Table 1). If the baseline data is

  The 2008 BSS used female bar workers as a proxy for female commercial sex workers. The validity and
reliability of this proxy remains unclear in Bhutan.



                                                 15
presumed to be accurate, it can be concluded that the target was met for the general
population in 2006 and partially met for high risk groups in 2008. However, as the
baseline information employed is not an accurate measure of the indicator, as discussed
above, and there was only one round for the BSS and the GPS, it is not possible to assess
and attribute change to the project with regard to this outcome indicator.

Outcome Indicator 2: Percentage of patients with selected STIs (i.e. urethral discharge in
men, and genital ulcers in men and women) at health care facilities who are
appropriately treated accordingly to the updated national guidelines increased from
<20% at baseline to 60% at project end.

The first round of Health Facility Survey (2009) was implemented late in the project
cycle (five years after project effectiveness). Using a combination of direct observation
and reported knowledge, it showed that only 25–30% percent of patients with STIs were
treated correctly, which was significantly below the target. A second round of the survey
was carried out in May 2011 using a subset of questions in the 2009 HFS instrument. As
direct observation was not used in the May 2011 survey round, information could only be
generated for providers‟ competence in STI management, which is entirely different from
the second outcome indicator. For this reason, comparisons between the two rounds
cannot be made. According to the latest HFS, 70% of health workers know how to treat
urethral discharge, 23% know how to treat male genital ulcers and 28% know how to
treat female genital ulcers. Given the well-known and significant gap between what
providers know and what they actually do6, the percentages of patients with these three
STIs who are appropriately treated according to national guidelines are most likely to be


5
 For female bar workers, there were different questions related to this topic in the questionnaire (condom
use in last sex with new commercial sex partner, in last sex with regular commercial sex partner, etc.),
hence the range of values.

6
 This is also referred to as the “know-do? gap. It is well documented in health literature. For example, a
2009 study by Leonard and Masatu in Tanzania shows that patients systematically receive health services
with quality below required levels. However, administered tests for health workers indicate that the level
of knowledge amongst the health workers is much higher than their practice suggests. (Professionalism
and the know-do gap: exploring intrinsic motivation among health workers in Tanzania. Health Economics.

                                                    16
much less than 70%, 23% and 38%, respectively. This means at project closure, the
percentage of patients with genital ulcers who are properly treated would be well below
the target of 60%.

Assessment of achievement of PDO on the basis of other output data

Given the difficulties to gauge project achievement on the basis of very limited and
incomplete data availability for the two outcome indicators (especially for outcome
indicator number 1), other output data are also examined, especially the coverage of
targeted interventions for high risk groups, which should be the crux of prevention efforts
in a low prevalence setting such as Bhutan.

Despite the stated priority of targeting MARPs, the project made little headway in
improving the coverage of targeted interventions for such groups as discussed above. At
the project end, NACP‟s estimates of active commercial sex workers were between 200
and 300 in Thimphu, and 50 and 100 in Phuentsholing. The HISC outreach program for
CSW was only reactivated toward the end of the project in 2011. Only 32 CSW in
Phuentsholing and less than a dozen in Thimphu were reached by non-peer outreach
workers at project end. Their exposure to the interventions was also very short, less than
six months. Besides these two urban centers, there was neither information on sex
workers in other areas of the country and nor interventions for them. In the absence of a
harm reduction strategy and program, injecting drug users were not benefitting from
clean needle and syringe exchange services or Opioid Substitution Therapy. Little was
known about men who have sex with men (MSM) in Bhutan and the project did not have
any specific interventions for this group.

As the main mode of HIV transmission is heterosexual (more than 90%) in Bhutan, HIV
can be primarily considered as an STI. In this setting, STIs are therefore an important
and sensitive biomarker of high-risk behaviors for HIV transmission. However, the
coverage of HIV interventions among non-HIV STI patients remained low. Accordingly
to the 2011 Health Facility Survey, around one third of non-HIV STI patients received
condoms. Only 19% of STI patients in 2010 and 26% in 2011 (January to April) were
provided with VCT services. This represents a weak link between HIV/AIDS and STI
activities and a lack of service integration. Police, army personnel, truckers and taxi
drivers were better reached with awareness raising and condom promotion, although the
exact numbers of beneficiaries under the project cannot be ascertained. Around 75% of
the general population reported easy access to condoms in 2006 (GPS 2006). Easy
access to condoms was much less for high risk groups: IDU (30%); female bar workers
(30-36%); migrant workers (2-14%); police (24-44%); army personnel (32%); taxi
drivers (62%), truckers (18%-47%) according to the BSS 2008.
For a detailed discussion of the project achievement, please see the ICR datasheet. In
summary, out of two PDO indicators, one is partially achieved if the baseline data is
accepted as accurate, while the other is not achieved. Out of ten Immediate Outcome
Indicators, eight are either not achieved or not monitored and only two targets are met.
The project performed better with regard to additional process indicators with targets for
12 achieved and six not achieved (Table 2).

Achievement of the PDO is rated Modest.

3.3 Efficiency

Due to the fact that the project only has one round of survey data, it is not possible to
conduct economic analyses to assess the project‟s efficiency. However, efficiency is
likely to be Modest for various reasons. First, there was little targeting of the drivers of
the epidemic and geographical hotspots for the most of the project period. Second, the
integration of HIV/AIDS and STI services was limited. Third, the MOH‟s weak
harmonization and coordination of GFATM activities and the project‟s work plan also
made the project less efficient.

3.4 Justification of Overall Outcome Rating

With a Substantial rating for project relevance, a Modest rating for project efficacy and a
Modest rating for efficiency, the overall outcome rating is Moderately Unsatisfactory.

3.5 Overarching Themes, Other Outcomes and Impacts

Project relevance:

(a) Poverty Impacts, Gender Aspects, and Social Development

HIV/AIDS is a well known cause of poverty. By limiting the spread HIV and mitigating
its consequences, the project was expected to help to prevent or reduce HIV-related
poverty. Unfortunately, the extent of the project's poverty reduction impacts cannot be
quantified due to the lack of data. However, given Bhutan‟s very low HIV prevalence as
well as relatively low rate of urban poverty, the impact on poverty measures is likely to
be negligible.


(b) Institutional Change/Strengthening

Institutional strengthening is assessed as substantial. A national HIV/AIDS policy and
the first National Strategic Plan were adopted. These helped lay the foundation for the
second National Strategic Plan which is now under development. Guidelines were
developed and disseminated for VCT, HIV/AIDS care, treatment and support, blood


                                              18
safety, STIs, infection control and health care waste management. A gonococcal
antimicrobial resistance surveillance system was established. Both clinical laboratories
and the public health laboratory were strengthened with the provision of equipment,
training and supplies, as well as the establishment of a national quality assurance program.
The number of laboratories meeting quality standards in HIV testing was 78% in 2011.
The Laboratory Information System (LIS) is now fully operational. NACP was
strengthened in terms of capacity, but not staff numbers. The blood bank network was
significantly strengthened with equipment, training, the development and implementation
of blood safety policies and guidelines with the support of the project. Various staffs in
the MOH were trained, but due to the high turnover, many are no longer working in the
area of HIV/AIDS. With regard to project management, many staff and implementers
were trained in financial management and procurement. MSTFs have been strengthened
and their capacity in working across sectors increased as a result of their involvement in
the project.

While there are only a handful of NGOs/CBOs in Bhutan, the establishment of the first
network of PLWHA (Lhaksam) with the support of the project marked a very important
milestone in civil society‟s response to HIV/AIDS.

4. Assessment of Risk to Development Outcome
The risk to development outcome is significant for the following reasons:

Human resource constraints: Despite the increased capacity in HIV/AIDS control owing
to the project‟s support, Bhutan continues to face tremendous challenges in human
resources for health, in general, and for HIV/AIDS control, in particular. Given the past
trend, high turn-over of staff will remain a problem for the national HIV/AIDS response.
While NACP is central to the management, coordination and M&E of the national
strategic plan, at the time of project closing, it remained severely understaffed.

Nascent civil society: The recent establishment of the first CSO of PLWHA in Bhutan is
a positive development. However, the very few number of civil society organizations in
Bhutan will continue to pose an obstacle to implementation of HIV/AIDS interventions
for high risk groups.

Failure to prioritize targeted interventions for high risk groups: The second national
strategic plan for HIV/AIDS clearly makes the case for targeting high risk groups with
adequate coverage of effective interventions. However, the lack of commitment as well
as the capacity to target such groups remains a significant risk to development outcomes.




                                            19
Adequate financing for the national HIV/ADS strategic plan: With the closing of the
Bank-financed HIVAIDS project as well as the GFATM‟s support coming to an end soon,
it will fall upon the RGOB to continue financing the NSP. So far, the RGOB has been
spending around US$ 0.2 million per year on HIV/AIDS control in addition to World
Bank and GFATM‟s resources. This would call for increased government funding for the
NSP.

5. Assessment of Bank and Borrower Performance
5.1 Bank Performance

(a) Bank Performance in Ensuring Quality at Entry

The project was prepared in a relatively short period of ten months. For project
preparation, the team ensured adequate consultations and detailed preparation for the
start-up period. While the project took a very comprehensive approach to HIV/AIDS and
STI control, preparation and design could have been strengthened by: (i) the development
of a national HIV/AIDS/STI strategic plan during project preparation; (ii) sole focus on
prevention of HIV/AIDS and STI for high risk groups in the PDO; (iii) more focused
multi-sectoral approach and streamlined project design; (iv) adequate risk mitigation
measures for human resource constraints; and (v) more realistic result framework and
targets.

Project preparation benefited from a Quality Enhancement Review in January 2004. A
Quality at Entry Assessment by the World Bank‟s Quality Assurance Group (QAG) was
carried out in July 2005. It praised the project‟s strategic relevance, design, technical,
economic and fiduciary aspects and risk analysis. A Satisfactory rating (2 out of 6, with
1 being the highest rating) was given to the project by the QAG panel. Given the design
shortcomings noted above, the Quality at Entry Assessment may have been over
optimistic in its rating. On the contrary, a subsequent Quality Assessment of Lending
Portfolio by QAG in 2009 gave a Moderately Unsatisfactory rating (4 out of 6) for the
project‟s quality of design, citing inadequate focus on MARPs in PDO and project
approach, complexity of design, and inadequate attention to the institutional constraints.

On balance, the Bank performance in ensuring quality at entry is rated Moderately
Satisfactory.

(b) Quality of Supervision

There was a relatively low turn-over in terms of task team leadership on the Bank‟s side
with only two TTLs throughout the project cycle. The first TTL was responsible for
project preparation and the first year of implementation. The second TTL took over in
November 2005 and worked on the project until its closing. This was helpful for
implementation support, given the high turn-over of the MOH technical staff working on
HIV/AIDS. Supervision missions were conducted every six months on average. The
Bank team involved various HIV/AIDS specialists in supervision, who provided valuable
technical inputs. The Sector Manager also participated in supervision and supported the


                                           20
policy dialogue when the project was at a critical junction. An on-time MTR was
conducted in November 2006. Generally speaking, supervision documents identified
implementation bottlenecks which can be grouped in three categories: (i) HIV/AIDS/STI
technical issues (e.g. targeting risk groups, BCC, social marketing of condoms, surveys);
(ii) financial management, (iii) procurement, and (iv) other project management issues
(e.g. planning and budgeting for results, routine M&E, coordination). The Bank team
was more proactive in the first two groups of issues, and less so for the last two. More
support could have been given to procurement as well as general, non-fiduciary project
management challenges. This type of implementation support would have been as
critical given the limited management and coordination capacity in the NACP and PMT.

The 2009 Quality Assessment of Lending Portfolio by QAG gave a Moderately
Unsatisfactory rating (4 out of 6) for Quality of Bank supervision, citing a lack of
Bank‟s forceful and targeted follow-up on persistent problems, inadequate use of
performance indicators and shortcomings in procurement support and oversight. While
the World Bank team consistently diagnosed an array of problems in project
implementation, many suggestions offered by the Bank failed to be implemented. This
failure indicated that a more fundamental approach could have been used by the World
Bank team such as project restructuring to address underlying causes of implementation
constraints. With regard to health care waste management, although the Bank team
diligently followed up on this topic, the support of a World Bank HCWM specialist was
given only one time. According to the QAG report, as project ratings in Implementing
Support Reports (ISRs) were overly optimistic, there were also issues with the candor and
realism of ISRs. A detailed analysis of Bank supervision is found in Annex 4.

The Bank's performance in ensuring quality supervision is rated Moderately
Unsatisfactory.

(c) Justification of Rating for Overall Bank Performance

With a Moderately Satisfactory rating for Quality at Entry and a Moderately
Unsatisfactory rating for Quality of Supervision, the overall Bank performance is
Moderately Unsatisfactory.

5.2 Borrower Performance

(a) Government Performance

The Ministry of Finance fulfilled all of its obligations related to the project throughout
the project cycle. Government performance is rated as Satisfactory.

(b) Implementing Agency or Agencies Performance

The MOH‟s commitment to the project was high during project preparation, appraisal
and during the first three years of implementation. There was a decline in its
commitment after 2007. At project closure, two of five legal covenants were fully
complied with, two partially complied with, and one complied after delay. Due to severe


                                            21
human resource constraints, NACP was unable to provide adequate technical guidance
and support to the implementers; and the PMT was unable to sufficiently fulfill its project
management and coordination functions. There were strong commitments and good
efforts of MSTF and selected line ministries in HIV/AIDS control, although they
operated without sufficient guidance and supervision by NACP and PMT. Finally, the
lack of targeted interventions for the most at-risk groups is an important indication of the
Implementing Agency‟s failure to give adequate attention and prioritization to this
critical dimension in HIV/AIDS control in a very low prevalence setting like Bhutan.

The performance of Implementing Agency is rated Moderately Unsatisfactory.

(c) Justification of Rating for Overall Borrower Performance

Given the critical role of the Implementing Agency, more weight is given to its
performance in the assessment of the overall Borrower performance. For this reason,
overall Borrower performance is rated as Moderately Unsatisfactory.

6. Lessons Learned
A National Strategic Plan for HIV/AIDS would contribute to the foundation for a
HIV/AIDS project: In the absence of any kind of strategic plan for HIV/AIDS, as was the
case in Bhutan, project preparation should include support for the development of such a
plan prior to appraisal. The plan would then form the basis for project design and
reinforce the “Three Ones? principles in HIV/AIDS response7. It would also help engage
all stakeholders and build stronger commitment.

Focus on most-at risk populations: In a low prevalence setting with severe human
resources constraints, such as Bhutan, the best use of resources (human and financial) is
to focus on HIV/AIDS interventions for MARPs. It is critical to undertake behavioral
surveillance and socio-geographical mapping of MARPs prior to designing policies and
program interventions. This would also provide baseline data for the Results Framework
and helps set realistic targets. In addition, STI patients should be viewed as a MARP and
benefit from BCC and VCT other than STI treatment.

Modality to reach MARPs: Public actors are less effective and motivated to conduct
outreach for marginalized MARPS such as CSW, IDU and MSM. Peer groups should be
mobilized for this purpose.

Streamlining multi-sectoral response: While the multi-sectoral approach can be relevant
for a low prevalence country; activities should be restricted to the most critical sectors



7
  The "Three Ones" principles promoted by UNAIDS are: one agreed HIV/AIDS action framework that
provides the basis for coordinating the work of all partners; one national AIDS coordinating authority; and
one agreed country-level monitoring and evaluation system



                                                    22
given severe human resource constraints, such as in Bhutan. Such a streamlined multi-
sectoral design would facilitate implementation.

Roles of NACP: First, central support to lower-level implementers should not be
overlooked in the context of decentralization, as implementers at lower levels still need
technical guidance and support from NACP for sound decision making. Second, given
the human resource constraints in the MOH, it would have been more efficient if the
NACP, the PMT for World Bank project and the PMT for GFATM, had been
consolidated into a single entity. This would have greatly facilitated the coordination and
management of all HIV/AIDS activities in the country regardless the financing source.

M&E: M&E should be tailored to the country‟s limited capacity and characteristics of
the epidemic. Information should be used to improve the evidence base for local decision
making.

One PMT to manage both World Bank and GFATM projects: Given (i) the need to
coordinate the two initiatives and (ii) human resources constraints in the MOH, it would
have been much more efficient if one PMT had been used to manage and coordinate both
projects.

               Implementation Completion Report (ICR), July 2011

1. Background

By the late 1980s, most countries in South Asia, though not Bhutan, had reported cases of
HIV infection. In an effort to prevent an HIV epidemic from emerging, the Government
of Bhutan instituted the National HIV/AIDS and STD Control Program (NACP) in 1988,
to disseminate public education programs for sexually transmitted infections (STIs) and
HIV. Although HIV prevention measures were prioritized and actualized, HIV entered
Bhutan‟s borders and the first two cases were detected in 1993 in a married couple at a
hospital through active surveillance. This marked the end of Bhutan‟s identity as the only
HIV free nation in the South Asian region.

UNAIDS estimated that there were fewer than 1000 people living with HIV/AIDS in
Bhutan as of the end of 2005 and the country has been classified by the WHO as having a
low-level HIV epidemic (less than 0.02% prevalence) in the general population. The
cumulative number of HIV infections detected was 217 as of mid 2010. These cases
range from farmers in rural villages to government workers in urban settings. HIV
infections have been documented to be spreading in two directions: (1) through the
general population and (2) through marginalized groups of sex workers and drug users.
Approximately 88% of current cases have occurred through heterosexual transmission.
However, mother-to-child transmission is also an important consideration. At present, 18
children (over 10% of the total cases) have been infected through vertical transmission.
Bhutan might be able to avert a potentially major HIV epidemic by increasing their
current HIV prevention efforts. However, Bhutan as a country is currently in a socio-
economically transitional phase, which creates challenges to HIV prevention, such as
increased rural-to-urban migration patterns. This increased urbanization results in the
decreased influence of traditional family and social networks. In addition, 45% of
Bhutan‟s population is less than 15 years of age and 63% of the population is less than 63
years of age [6]. Based on information collected from the NACP and the census, a large
proportion of the Bhutanese population are sexually active and are therefore at risk for
HIV/STI through sexual risk behaviors.

The Royal Government of Bhutan recognizing the threat of the unabated HIV epidemic
in the small society had mobilized resources both internal and external sources to prevent
the spread of the epidemic. The World Bank support for the HIV project has been the
biggest single source financer for HIV prevention from 2004 to 2011.

2. The National HIV/AIDS and STI prevention and control project-World Bank


                                           35
The World Bank Project was formalized in July 2004 with the total grant amount of USD
5.7 million. The project appraisal document was signed between the Royal Government
of Bhutan and the World Bank. The Ministry of Health was responsible for managing the
project. The Goal of the project was to reduce the risk of HIV/AIDS and STI
transmission among the general population, in particular groups whose sexual behavior
put them at high risk. The project was initially signed for the period of five years

The indicators set to measure the performance of the project included:
   (i) Increase in condom use in the last non-regular (paid and casual) sex partner
            among at risk groups and the general adult population;
   (ii) Increase in percentage of patients with selected STIs (urethral discharge in men
            and genital ulcers in men and women) presenting to health care facilities, who
            are appropriate treated accordingly to national guidelines.

The key outcome indicators included:
    Percentage of person reporting condom use with last non regular sex partner
      increased from <20% at project start to 60% among priority groups and 30%
      among general population
    Percentage of patient with selected STIs at health care facilities who are
      appropriately treated accordingly to the updated national guidelines increased
      from <20% in baseline (Yr2) to 60% at project end

The project plan consisted of four main components with the budgetary allocation as
follows:
(i) Prevention of HIV/AIDS and STIs (34%)
Prevention of HIV/AIDS and STI to promote political and societal leadership in the fight
against HIV/AIDS, improve community knowledge and attitudes about HIV prevention,
promote risk-reducing behavior amongst priority groups, and increased access to condom

(ii) Institutional Strengthening and Capacity Building (29%)
Institutional strengthening and building capacity to enhance the ability of national
institution to lead the fight against HIV through training and technical assistance, and will
strengthen laboratory and blood transfusion services

(iii) Care, Support, and Treatment of HIV/AIDS and STIs (18%)
Care, support and treatment of AIDS and STIs to establish VCT services, strengthen
management of STIs and HIV/AIDS (comprehensive care and treatment approach,
including introduction of ART), and improve infection control and waste management in
health facilities.


                                             36
(iv) Strategic Information for HIV/AIDS and STIS (19%)
Strategic information for HIV/AIDS and STIs to promote evidence based decision
making by improving health information management, strengthening operation research
capacity, instituting M&E and second generation surveillance systems.

3. Assessment of the project design
On assessing the project design, it is felt that the project has been comprehensively
designed with detailed project implementation plan (PIP) defining the roles and
responsibilities of both the project management team and implementing units like NACP.
The activities are linked with the overall project goals and objectives. However, the
stakeholders commonly felt that there was inadequate orientation to the World Bank
procurement system across the stakeholders, hence resulting in delay in implementation
and caused confusion at times.

Although the significant share of the project resource had been allocated in the area of
prevention focusing on condom promotion and behavioral change, the project could not
adequately focus on targeted intervention for high risk populations.

The recruitment of the fulltime competent personnel under project was challenging task
for the Ministry of Health. This is mainly due to the shortage of competent national staffs
and poor turnover of the international TAs. The staffs managing the project often had to
shoulder additional responsibilities beyond the project. This issue was not appropriately
considered during the design of the project.

NACP continually faced the issues of human resources shortages over the duration of the
project. PMT should have been merged with the NACP. This could have eased the human
resource shortages and at the same time could have resulted in better overall coordination
of activities and resources.

The stakeholders also felt that the role of the mission team of the Bank to assess the
implementation process was not defined within the project operational manual. The dual
approval process from PMT, MoH and further from the Bank (DC) on majority of the
activities was seen crucial but posed huge administrative burden leading to the delays in
implementation.

5. Key highlights of performances of key stakeholders
Under the support of the project key implementing partners were
     National HIV/AIDS Commission
     National AIDS Control Program
     Line Ministries ( Ministry of Education, Ministry of Home and Cultural Affairs,
       Ministry of Trade and Industry)
     Multi-sectoral Task forces in Districts (MSTF)

National HIV/AIDS Commission (NHAC)
The National AIDS Committee formed in 1993 was upgraded to the National HIV/AIDS
Commission in February 2004 to strengthen national coordination for HIV response and
to guides HIV and AIDS policy formulation and national responses. The NHAC consists
of ministerial representation from all relevant ministries and other institutions. It is the
apex policymaking body on HIV/AIDS with the Health Minister as Chairperson. The
National STI & HIV/AIDS Control program, Department of Public Health serves as the
Secretariat to the NHAC. From 2004 to 2011 ( June ), there were 13 meetings of the
National HIV/AIDS Commission out of which 11 were supported by the World Bank
Project.

Major policies on prevention care and treatment were formulated during the period of the
World Bank. Key policies include, strengthening multisectoal response, infant feeding
policies among children born from HIV infected mothers, and supportive services for sex
workers, and greater involvement of people infected with HIV/AIDS. In addition, care
and treatment for STI were strengthened with the expansion of the syndromic
management of STIs in the country.

National STD/AIDS Control Program (NACP)
NACP was responsible for implementing NHAC policy directives, monitoring and
implementation of HIV/AIDS and STI prevention and control activities at the national
level. In addition, NACP was also responsible for implementation of STI/HIV component
of the project. NACP collaborated and provided technical assistance to other
implementing agencies.

Line Ministries: Several line ministries like the Department of Tourism under the
Ministry of Trade and Industry, the Road Safety and Transport Authority under the
Ministry of Information and Communication, Armed forces and the Multi-Sectoral Task
force in the districts were implementing partners and annual workplans were funded by
the project. The activities were mainly focussed towards general prevention and
contributed towards the component one of the project. The contribution of the line
ministries and especially that of the MSTF have been vital in raising the general
awareness.


                                            41
However the progress of the line ministries was slow due to limited technical and
management capacity at the Dzongkhag and line ministry level which was aggravated by
limited technical support and supervision by NACP and PMT. Further ownership by the
line ministries were not adequate and focal persons assigned didn‟t have adequate time as
they had their own responsibilities of their parent agencies.
From the later part of 2008 funding support for many of the line ministries was
withdrawn as there was duplication with the Global Fund Project.

Civil Society: REWA, an NGO working with drug users initiated outreach intervention
to promote HIV prevention and harm reduction behaviour among drug users, principally
among in- and out-of school youth in Thimphu for a period of 6 months. However the
organization was closed down following some issues external to the project.

The project also funded the initial capacity development of the informal network of
people living with HIV/AIDS. Training manuals were developed and trainings conducted
for the members. The organization has now been a full fledge NGO of people living with
HIV/AIDS in Bhutan.

6. Summary of progress
A lot has been done for the general population through the World Bank Project. MSTF
annual work plan based activities with technical guidance from NACP has been
implemented each year since 2004. Focus of the activities were mainly on creating
awareness on HIV, reducing stigma and discrimination and conducting events during
local festivals. World AIDS Day was observed at the national level and as well as in all
of the 20 Districts each year. Media campaigns by airing HIV messages on the national
television, radio programs and print media targeting the general population were done.

Success among the general population could be indicated from the higher condom use
rates overall in comparison to other countries in the table below. While the populations,
age categories and indicator definitions are not identical, Bhutan seems to have higher
condom use rates overall. GPS, 2008 found that among married male respondents,
condom use at last extramarital sex encounters exceeded 80% with slightly higher rates
among urban males. Among unmarried males, reported use of condoms in last sexual
intercourse was in excess of 75%.

Condom promotion and distribution was done mainly by establishing condom boxes at
the entertainment venues and other sites in all the 20 districts. In the GPS, 75% of
respondents (83% of males, 67% of females) reported easy access to condoms. Condom
demonstration is held in almost all of the MSTF awareness activities. However during the
various monitoring and supervision visits it was found that most of the condom boxes
were empty. There is no replenishment strategy.

The NACP with the support of the World Bank Project developed the VCT guidelines
and trained at least two people from all the hospitals in the country. VCT is being offered
in all the district hospitals. Also two free standing VCT centers under the brand name
HISC (Health Information Service Center) was established in Phuntsholing and
Thimphu. These two places have the highest number of cases detected. An integrated
VCT center was also established at the National Referral Hospital.

In the field of care and treatment, management guidelines for care and treatment of
HIV/AIDS cases were developed and health workers trained on it. Guidelines on PMTCT
were also developed and health workers trained. CD 4 machine procured. Currently about
54 people are on treatment.

STI syndromic management guidelines were also developed and the treatment regimen
were also revised.

Overall about 662 medical personnel were trained on VCT, HIV care and treatment and
STI syndromic management at the central level and cascading training provided to all the
district hospitals.



                                            43
For support of PLHAs, training module for PLHAs was developed and training of
PLHAs conducted. One of the successes of the initiatives taken to work with PLHAs is
the formation of the informal network of PLHAs which is now a fully fledged NGO of
PLHAs in Bhutan.

In order to build the evidence and generate strategic information several studies were
conducted in collaboration with the Research unit, MoH. The following studies have been
conducted with the funding support of the World Bank Project.

Targeted Interventions: While lot of achievement has been made in the general
populations, very little could be done in terms of targeted interventions. All though
numerous plans were made to target groups like the sex workers, the implementation
failed to take off. It wasn‟t until the last year of the project that something solid was
initiated as part of targeted interventions. A packaged program outsourced to the
University of Manitoba was initiated to target high risk groups in Phuntsholing and
Thimphu. A rapid assessment on sexual networks in Thimphu and Phuntsholing was
conducted and venue based interventions designed and implemented through the two
HISCs. Through this project about 69 sex workers have been reached out of which 48 are
registered with the HISCs for regular follow up.

Gaps

Prioritization of so many activities with the general population has resulted in neglect of
interventions with key affected populations. Condom use during first sexual intercourse
among drug users was much lower at 38% (*NBA, 2009) compared to the general
population.

Too much focus on HIV has also resulted in the neglect of interventions for STIs. This
could be the explanation in the slight increase of STIs over the years. 89.6% knew that
condoms can prevent HIV, but very few (34.7%) knew that STIs can also be prevented
by condoms (*GPS, 2008). Less people have heard about STI than they have about
HIV/AIDS. 82 % of the respondents from the armed forces and youths in school have
heard about STIs, which is comparatively lower than their familiarity with HIV/AIDS
(>95%). Only 57.9% out of school youths have heard about STIs indicating a huge
knowledge gap about STIs.*(KABP survey, 2009/GPS, 2008).

Given the fact that there is no condom replenishment mechanism for the condom boxes,
it can be said that the condom boxes have not been effective in terms of making condom
accessible to those who require it and at the time they require it. Therefore the program is
considering alternative strategy of condom distribution.

8. Lessons learnt from project implementation

      Managing multi-sectoral partnerships for HIV prevention: Under the Project,
       multi-sectoral partnership among the Ministries, District Administration and
       Community Based Organizations were explored and implemented. The
       monitoring of the activities was done by the Project Management Team. These
       partnerships provided opportunity to expand the genuine collaboration for a
       multisectoral response. The collaboration could have been further strengthened if
       the memorandum of understating had been signed and progress monitored
       between the PMT and the stakeholders.
      Peer outreach interventions and targeting the most at risk: During the span of
       the project, continued efforts were made to focus most at risk for HIV in the
       Bhutanese epidemic context. Though the approach of focusing on the most at risk
       was slow, the later phase of the project was successful in targeting the people and
       venues where people engage in risky behaviors. The sexual network study
       conducted in Bhutan‟s two biggest urban cities at Thimphu, the capital and
       Phuntsholing the Indo-Bhutan commercial hub was the key information used for
       piloting the peer outreach interventions. These pilot programs focused on the
       venues ( hotels, bars and karoakes) and also intensified interventions among
       specific population groups ( truckers, taxi drivers )
      Making STI services more effective: Prior to the Project, the most common STI
       – gonorrhea was treated with penicillin even though there health staffs knew that
       laboratory evidences showed gonococcal resistance to penicillin. Following the
       pre-project assessment was conducted by the World Bank Project to validate the
       resistance pattern of the gonorrhea to penicillin; syndromic management manual
       was revised in 2006 in which the urethral discharge treatment was modified by
       replacing penicillin by injection ceftriaxone. The gonococcal antibiotic
       susceptibility program was strengthened by introducing five sentinel sites.
      Research and evidence building culture: During the phase of the project, many
       surveys were conducted to assess the existing evidence, evaluate the STI services
       and understand the overall impact in terms of change in behaviors. The surveys
       conducted by the implementing partners enhanced the skills and promoted
       understanding among the health policy makers of the necessity of research to
       inform public health strategies .
      Health system strengthening: Besides focusing on HIV prevention, the Project
       was built with a focus on broad based health system and capacities. The project
       provided opportunity to review in depth and demonstrated improvements in


                                           45
       laboratory services, STI prevention, waste management and infection control
       system and health information system. The project offered avenue for reforms
       such as health care financing
      Dedicated program staffs critical to implement the projects: To ensure smooth
       management of such projects, dedicated management is essential. At the start of
       the project, the Project Management was led by a senior official who was
       assigned the sole responsibility of project management. Subsequently with the
       higher turnover of the project management resulted in the slackening of the
       project activities
      New approaches to logistic and supply management system: The procurement
       staffs at the DVED and the administration unit of the Ministry of Health were
       oriented on the Bank procurement system of goods and consultancies. The
       experience from this project could be used by the MoH and in particular the
       DVED to adapt the procurement manual in future.
      Standard reporting framework: The Project information requirements were
       different from the routine Health Management Information system (HMIS). The
       HMIS was either too slow to adapt or was not adaptive because the forms were to
       be reprinted. The project resorted to developing an independent format which was
       not usually follow up should be included with the project document.

9. Sustaining HIV prevention and way forward:

Tremendous achievements have been made with the support of the World Bank Project in
terms of scaling up targeted interventions, strengthening of care and treatment for
HIV/AIDS, STI management, raising t awareness, and mobilizing political commitment
for HIV/AID prevention. The World Bank is the biggest financer so far for Bhutan HIV
prevention control efforts since 2004 to 2011. The Ministry of Health will find it
challenging to maintain a financial support to the level provided by the World Bank.
However, in order to keep the momentum gained in HIV and STI prevention so far, it is
crucial for the MoH to take serious efforts to secure resources. The following measures
are being implemented to ensure adequate financial support with the aim to achieve
sustainable programming for HIV prevention in the country:

Future plans
    Increase financial resource allocations from the government for STIs, care and
      treatment for HIV and improving surveillance system
    The NACP will propose incremental government resource allocation commitment
      from the RGoB
    ARV procurement and treatment associated costs will be mobilized from the
      RGoB
    The DoPH will pursue with the RCSC for filling up 4 approved vacant positions
      of NACP
    NACP will collaborate with the UN agencies for resource mobilization and
      support for program interventions
    Explore funds for Global Fund for AIDS, TB and Malaria



                                          46
   The Five Year National Strategic Plan is revised with the termination of the
    project. The Strategy will be costed and a detail operational plan is being
    prepared. This will be advocated for funding support from various sources.
