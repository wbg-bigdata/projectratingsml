STAFF APPRAISAL REPORT OF
A THIRD HIGHWAY PROJECT
AFGHANISTAN
I. THE TRANSPORT SECTOR
A.   Effects of Geography and Economic Growth on Transport
1.01      Afghanistan, a landlocked country located in Central Asia, borders
with the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics (USSR) to the north, Iran to the
west, Pakistan to the south and east, and the People's Republic of China to
the extreme northeast (see Map IBRD 14048).  It covers an area of about
655,000 km2, somewhat less than the size of Turkey, of which 12% is arable,
60% is pasture land and the remainder is either desert or mountainous.  Nearly
half of the total area is more than 1,800 m above sea level with some areas
exceeding 5,000 m. The 725 km Hindu Kush mountain range separates the fertile
northern agricultural plain from the arid deserts in the south, making all
overland communications between the north and the south difficult to establish
and maintain. Due to the topographic conditions of the country, rivers are
difficult to navigate which precludes using this low-cost means of transporta-
tion, except for a stretch of about 200 km of the Amu Darya river at the
border with USSR. The climate is sunny and dry, with precipitation varying
between 50 and 400 mm per year, but with extreme daily and seasonal tempera-
ture variation, especially in the northern part. The combination of rough
topography and wide climatic variations make road construction and maintenance
rather costly.
1.02      No population census has been held in the country, and available
population estimates are subject to a wide margin of error. An official esti-
mate of the country's population is about 17 million in September 1978 and
growing at about 2% per annum. Approximately 70% of the population is rural
and widely dispersed, with about half of the total population living in the
Eastern Region, one quarter in the Northern, and the rest evenly distributed
between the Southern and Western Regions. The density of the population
varies considerably, from a few inhabitants per km2 in the most arid regions
to more than 100 inhabitants per km2 in the most fertile ones. The wide
dispersion of the population calls for a rather extensive transport network,
mainly of low volume roads.
1.03      The predominantly agricultural nature of economic activity (agricul-
ture contributes about half the GNP) determines the principal transport needs.
It is estimated that two-thirds of agricultural output is for farm consump-
tion, thereby greatly reducing total transport needs. However, this situation
is probably partly a consequence of the very poor transport facilities in
several areas of the country, that impair production for the market and more
efficient exploitation of the land. About 2.0 million of the total population
are nomads, predominantly engaged in cattle breeding on mountain pastures



-2-
where annual precipitation is adequate to make this way of life possible.
They are scattered all over the country and are largely self-sufficient.
Therefore, their demands on the modern transport system are minimal. The rest
of agricultural production is subject to long distance hauls between the farms
and the main consumption centers in the country as well as those in the
surrounding countries either to be consumed, or for export to farther markets.
The areas suitable for agricultural exploitation are scattered all over the
country into rather small areas, which increases the length of the low volume
roads required.
1.04      The location of the country in the world affects international
transport to and from Afghanistan. Some of the main reasons are:
(i) the country's remoteness from the principal markets;
(ii) frequent cargo transshipments required to arrive at the
final destination, with long and unpredictable transit
times, excessive loss and breakage and, therefore, high
credit costs and insurance premiums;
(iii) the dependence of its international routes on political,
transport, and other conditions in neighboring countries;
and
(iv) the absence of unrestricted access to the sea which
causes long clearing times, because Afghan cargo in
neighboring countries' ports normally receives lower
priority than national cargo.
B.   The Transport System
1.05      Roads provide the principal means of transportation for both
internal and international traffic. Details of the highway sub-sector are
given in Chapter II.
1.06      Domestic civil aviation serves an administrative and social func-
tion, by providing access to areas with poor or non-existent road connections.
Internationally, because of Afghanistan's remoteness, aviation is the most
appropriate means for international business and tourism travel. The coun-
try's civil air transport system has largely been developed over the last 20
years with USA and Russian aid.  It now contains 20 airports and airstrips of
which Kabul, with more than two-thirds of all international and domestic
passenger movements, is by far the most important.  In the period 1969-76 the                 L
international and domestic passenger movements in Kabul increased from 76,000
in 1969 to 118,000 in 1976, or an annual growth rate of about 6.5%.
1.07      No railways exist, except for 600 m of railway line between Torghundi
and the USSR border, because the mountainous terrain makes construction too
difficult and expensive, while the volume of bulk products for long-distance
hauls is at present not significant. In the past, the Government has con-
sidered the possibility of building some 1,800 km of railways with financial
assistance from Iran, but it seems the idea has been discarded.



- 3 -
1.08      The remaining two modes are river transport and pipelines.  River
transport takes place only on the Amu Darya River for international traffic
between Afghanistan and the USSR, with all commercial vessels owned and
operated by the latter. The main river ports are Sherkhan and Hairatan. The
ports are administered by the Port Department under the Ministry of Commerce.
Approximately 100 miles of pipelines link the gas fields around Shebergan with
the Russian border at Kleft. A considerable amount of traffic is carried by
animals, mostly camels and donkeys, even over long distances and on routes
not yet served by the road network.
1.09      As a landlocked country, international transport routes are of vital
significance. The following are the main routes presently used:
(i)  Via the USSR:  This country prohibits commercial road
traffic across the border. However, the USSR, through
its agency Sojuzneshtrans, offers Afghanistan extensive
land transport linkages to the Pacific (via Vladivostok),
to northern Europe and USA (via Leningrad) and to southern
Europe (via Black Sea ports) based upon a combination of
railroad and ship services.
(ii)  Via Pakistan:  With very rare exceptions, all the cargo
to the port of Karachi must be transshipped to Pakistan
railway lines (gauge 1.67 m) mainly at Peshawar which is
1,450 km from Karachi and sometimes at Chacman, a dis-
tance of 938 km. The port of Karachi has considerable
congestion problems and Afghani commerce is often given
low priority. The operation of through trucks between
Afghanistan and India is discouraged by Pakistan, and
the cargo, mainly fruits, must be transferred first to
Pakistan vehicles and then to Indian ones.
(iii)  Via Iran:  Access to the sea is by way of the ports of
Khorramshahar and Bandar-e-Shahpur, both heavily congested
and with time consuming clearing procedures. The ports are
located about 2,300 km from Herat. The cargo is normally
expected to be moved by Iran Railways (gauge 1.435 m) from
Meshed (240 km west of the border), although Iranian trucks
can be used in case of necessity. The transit treaty between
Iran and Afghanistan does not permit the through movement of
commercial vehicles from a city in one country to a city in
the other. However, Afghan vehicles are permitted to operate
up to the rail terminal in Meshed and Iranian vehicles up to
Herat. Afghan vehicles transiting Iran have so far been
permitted to operate without difficulties.
1.10       In 1976 the country's export, import and transit amounted to about
1,000,000 tons; 70% was moved through the USSR, 20% through Pakistan and only
10% through Iran. Main exports in 1976 and their percentage in weight were:
fresh fruits (49%), dry fruits (21%), cotton (11%) and oil seeds (5%).
Similar information for main imports were: petroleum products (59%), sugar



-4-
(19%) and tea (5%).  More than half of the total international cargo of the
country was moved through the river port of Hairatan located at the border
with the USSR. The two countries have agreed to construct a combined road
and railway bridge across the Amu Darya River at Hairatan with technical and
financial assistance from the USSR. When completed, the bridge is expected to
carry most of the traffic between Afghanistan and the USSR.
C.   Transport Policy, Planning and Coordination
1.11      The new Government that took power at the end of April 1978, has
not yet announced its transport policy and national objectives in the sector.
The general impression is that the new Government is aware of the policy-
related problems in the sector and is considering how best to solve them,
particularly with respect to: traffic and vehicle regulations (paras. 2.09
and 2.10), import duties (para. 2.06), truck rates (para. 2.08), etc. These
matters have been discussed during negotiations and the team leader of the
technical assistance team under the project will be available to help the
Government in studying these matters (para. 3.09).
1.12      Table 1.1 shows the country's capital and recurrent expenditures in
1957-1976. During the First and Second Five-Year Plan periods, 1957-1966, the
construction of a suitable primary road infrastructure received top priority,
and transport sector expenditures amounted to 33% of the First Five-Year Plan
expenditures, 1957-1961, and 43% of the Second Five-Year Plan, 1962-1966.
During the Third and Fourth Five-Year Plans, 1967-1976, the emphasis in the
sector shifted from construction of new roads to maintenance and improvement
of the existing network. Transport sector expenditures amounted to 8-9%
of the Third and Fourth Five-Year Plan expenditures. This shift reflects
increased Government emphasis on protecting the considerable investments made
earlier in the highway system and seems to be a change in the right direction.

1972-1976 was computed by mission.

Planning, Kabul, 1972
1969-1976:  First Seven-Year Economic and Social Development Plan
1976-1983, Ministry of Planning, Kabul 1976
1.13      The Ministry of Planning is responsible for overall economic plan-
ning and for coordinating planning by the various agencies in the transport
sector. In the absence of rail-road competition, transport coordination
amongst modes is not one of the principal issues. The agencies responsible
for planning in the transport sector are: The Ministry of Public Works (MPW)
for the main highway network; the Rural Development Department (RDD) for the
rural roads carrying very low traffic volumes; the Afghan Air Authority for
civil aviation; and the Ministry of Commerce for ports. In general, planning
in all transport agencies is still in an early stage of development, often
carried out on a'ad hoc basis.
1.14      As to the MPW, in particular its Road Construction and Maintenance
Department (RCMD), planning was introduced under the First Highway Project,
through a study by consultants, which provided the general principles and
methodology for the preparation and planning of highway projects. Since
then, RCMD has started systematic traffic surveys and the updating of road
inventory. The Government is aware that the data are not always complete



and reliable, and that it does not yet have the necessary expertise for com-
prehensive project preparation. For example, correlation between traffic
counts taken at the same location, but at different points in time over the
year, has not yet been well established. To further improve the situation,
the proposed project provides technical assistance to assist the Government
in this area (para. 3.09).
D.   Previous Projects in the Transport Sector
1.15      In the transport sector, Afghanistan has received three loans from
the International Development Association (IDA) for a total amount of $19
million, two for road improvements and maintenance and a third one for an
aviation project.
1.16      The First Highway Maintenance Project of June 1969 (Credit 158-AF),
for a total amount of $5.0 million, did not become effective until mid-1970
after a long ratification process by the parliament. The project comprised
the first stage of a two-stage highway maintenance program and included:
(i) the organization of the Road Maintenance First Directorate (RMFD) in the
Eastern Region; and (ii) the introduction of more efficient maintenance opera-
tions and the improvement of selected paved highways and of high priority un-
paved roads in the Eastern Region. The project provided also for the purchase
of highway maintenance and workshop equipment, spare parts, and materials.
Until about mid-1971, execution of the project was in general satisfactory
although somewhat delayed mainly because of the long interval before the loan
became effective. The delays were much aggravated, thereafter, mainly due to
management problems; the situation improved early in 1973, after some staff
changes were made and necessary funds were released. The project has been
completed and the Credit was closed on December 31, 1977.
1.17      The Second Road Improvement and Maintenance project of December 1973
(Credit 449-AF), for a total amount of $11.5 million, became effective in mid-
1974. The project is an extension of the previous project by including the
Southern and Western Regions, and consists of: (i) maintenance of about 4,000
km of roads of which 1,800 km to be improved, including purchases of equip-
ment, spare parts and materials; (ii) construction of a highway maintenance
center in Kabul: (iii) technical assistance by consultants to the Road Main-
tenance General Directorate (RMGD), at that time the agency responsible for
the project area; and (iv) training of its staff. The project is being imple-
mented with a delay of about one and a half years due to delays in procurement
and delivery of equipment and in the construction of the highway maintenance
center in Kabul. An amount of US$2.7 million remains undisbursed of which
US$2.2 million has been committed. To enable the Government to complete the
equipment deliveries and construction of the highway maintenance center, the
Closing Date has been postponed from mid-1978 to the end of 1979. A further
extension may be necessary to take care of the vehicle load and dimension
regulation included in the Credit Agreement.
1.18      The First Aviation Project of May 1973 (Credit 374-AF), of US$2.5
million, became effective in November 1973. The project consists of: (i)
substitution by a new Flight Information Center (FIC) in Kabul of an obsolete
facility in Kandahar; (ii) technical assistance by consultants to strengthen



the civil aviation administration; and (iii) a feasibility study by consul-
tants of an airport at Logar to replace the existing airport at Kabul, which
has limited capacity, with subsequent final engineering if justified. The FIC
has been satisfactorily completed and only spare parts procurement remains to
be finalized. Based on the study, the Government decided, and the Association
agreed, not to proceed with the development of a new airport. An accounting
system for the Air Navigation Service was prepared by a consultant. So far
the Government has failed to implement the system or to undertake the institu-
tional reorganization covenant under Credit Agreement. The Association has
indicated to the Government that utilization of the uncommitted Credit funds
(about 30%) would be related to the Government's satisfactory compliance with
the covenants.
1.19      The role of IDA since its first involvement in the transport sector
in Afghanistan has been beneficial in the area of institution building and has
permitted a greater exposure of the country to the whole process of project
preparation and implementation. However, progress has been slow mainly
because of: (i) Government resistance to accept consultant services; (ii)
cumbersome procurement methods; (iii) Government failure to ensure timely
release of local funds; (iv) slow decision-making processes; and (v) frequent
changes of key personnel. The Government seems to be aware of this situation.
During negotiations, the Association was informed that legislation with
respect to access to highways and the use of adjacent land had recently been
adopted and that a draft proposal for axle load and vehicle dimension is being
reviewed by an inter departmental committee.
II. HIGHWAYS
A.   The Network
2.01      The total length of the road network is about 21,500 km, of which
13% are paved, 20% are gravel and the remaining 67% are earth roads (Table
2.1). The present length of the road network is about 3.5 times that in 1957,
when the network was composed of only gravel and earth roads. Over the last 5
years the total length increased 3%, but the increase in asphalt roads was a
significant 15%.
2.02      The backbone of the primary network is the Kabul-Kandahar-Herat-
Mazar-i-Sharif-Kabul road, which encircles the mountainous inner part of the
country and gives access to the agricultural plains in the north and the
desert areas of the south and the west (Map IBRD 14048). After completion
of the Shebargan-Maimana-Herat section in this circular road, the primary
network would be largely in place. However, most of the asphalt paved roads
constructed in the mid-sixties, are gradually reaching the end of their pave-
ment lives. In view of the rapid increase in traffic in recent years, espe-
cially of heavy vehicles, they need strengthening to protect the considerable
investments made in the past. Also, a substantial part of the unpaved roads
need to be upgraded to provide better access to the rural areas. The proposed
project would help to alleviate the above mentioned deficiencies by providing
assistance for highway maintenance and a pavement strengthening program.

B.   Traffic and Road Transport Industry
2.03      The statistical information on transport demand is weak and some-
times contradictory. The main sources of information are annual road traffic
counts carried out by the MPW, toll station data, and special traffic studies
conducted by consultants for specific projects. On a national basis, road
freight was estimated by the Government at about 800 million ton-km in 1968
and at 1,300 million ton-km in 1975, representing an annual growth of around
7%. There is no reliable information on road passenger transport.
2.04      Traffic counts on the primary network (see Annex 1, IBRD Map 14049)
during 1973-77 indicate that the average annual increase in average daily
traffic (ADT) was 12.8%, substantially higher than the estimated annual growth
rate of GNP of 3%. The higher growth rate of traffic is partly due to the
fact that motorized vehicles are gradually replacing the more traditional
means of transport such as carts and transport by camel.
2.05       In 1975, the road vehicle fleet comprised 51,000 vehicles, including
11,000 trucks, 6,000 buses, 14,000 private cars and 13,000 non-private cars
and taxis. The rest of the fleet consists of motorcycles and auto-rickshas.
Table 2.2 illustrates the distribution of the vehicle fleet.

Source:  Traffic Department, Ministry of Interior, August 1977.
The total road vehicle fleet increased during 1973-75 at an annual growth rate
of approximately 15%, with the highest increase in buses (26%), taxis (25%),
and trucks (13%). Unfortunately, information on the fleet is available only
for 3 years and, therefore, no firm trends can be established. The regional
distribution of vehicles in 1975 was as follows: Eastern region 75%; Northern
10%; Southern 10%; and Western 5%. Despite the concentration of vehicles in
the Kabul area, the four regions have a fair share of the vehicle fleet, in
line with their economic development and population.
2.06      Because used and smaller trucks are subject to more favorable import
duties than new and larger trucks, the trucking fleet is markedly skewed to-
ward small and old trucks. The same applies to buses and cars. However, not-
withstanding the current structure of import tariffs for transport vehicles,
the use of larger trucks is increasing because of their lower transport costs
per ton-km. The Government should review its import tariffs to ensure the
most economical age composition of the fleet. This was discussed during nego-
tiations.
2.07      Entry into the road transport market is free and, in general terms,
there are enough trucks on the primary roads and on the better roads of the
secondary road network. The situation is different for the remaining second-
ary, tertiary and feeder roads where it is more difficult to find adequate
transport. On these roads, there is not enough competition among truckers,
and therefore the truck rates are high. The improvements of the secondary and
tertiary roads under the proposed project should promote increased competition
on these roads. The predominant type of transporter is a small one, owning
only one or two trucks. Some of the individual transporters are organized
in transport associations which procure and allocate shipments among their
members. Government goods, which account for about 40% of the total haulage,
are handled by the big associations. The main government goods are: con-
struction materials, cement, petroleum products, sugar, wheat, fertilizers,
wood and minerals.
2.08      Tariffs for road freight distinguish between government goods and
private goods. Official tariffs govern the transport of government goods,
whereas for private goods, tariffs are agreed after a bargaining process



- 10 -
between the shipper or middleman and the transporter. The present official
tariffs of Afg. 1.8 (4.5 US cents) per ton-km on flat roads and Afg. 2.0 (5 US
cents) per ton-km on rolling and/or mountainous roads, without any distinction
in type of cargo or conditions of the road, seem to be below operating costs.
To ensure balanced development of the trucking industry, the Government should
review its freight tariffs. This was discussed during negotiations. During
harvest peaks in summer, tariffs for private goods are generally higher than
the official rate, but in times of low demand, tariffs may decline even below
the official rates.  While there is free entry in the road transport market,
all commercial inter-urban goods transport require an operating permit for
each trip, issued by the General Transport Department (GTD) under the Ministry
of Commerce.  The system enables GTD to establish priorities if demand exceeds
supply momentarily; in general this system works satisfactorily.
2.09      At the present time, there are no regulations on weights and dimen-
sions of vehicles, and especially trucks and buses are often overloaded. A
study by consultants on this subject, financed under the First Highway Project
and updated under the Second Highway Project, recommended a maximum permis-
sible axle load of 8 tons for single axles and 14 tons for tandem axles.
Under the Credit Agreement for the Second Highway Project, the Government
undertook to adopt dimensions and axle load regulations before September 30,
1974, and thereafter to implement them. Although the above date was overly
optimistic, the adoption of these regulations is overdue. The RCMD has
recently submitted draft regulations for review by an inter ministerial
committee. To allow sufficient time for review by the Committee and for the
subsequent legislative steps that have to be taken, the date for adoption of
the regulations has been extended to December 31, 1979.
2.10      On November 15, 1972, a Road Traffic Law was enacted establishing
general principles for the regulation of road traffic behavior. Better
enforcement of traffic regulations and vehicle inspection would help to
improve the situation, but only a long-term process of driver education will
be most effective.
C.   Administration
2.11      MWP has overall responsibility for the construction and maintenance
of roads outside the boundaries of the major cities. Within the MPW the orga-
nization specifically in charge of roads in the project area (the Eastern,
Southern and Western Regions) is the Road Construction and Maintenance Depart-
ment (RCMD).  Responsibility for the planning and construction of rural roads,
not under the responsibility of MPW, lies with RDD, which is directly respon-
sible to the Prime Minister.
2.12      The RCMD was established in 1967 and has since been reorganized many
times to better represent its growing specialization. The present organiza-
tion is shown on Chart C-1. Whereas the RCMD deals, through its improvement
units, with the improvement of existing roads, the construction of new roads
is carried out by the Army Labor Corps, a military organization, under tech-
nical supervision of the RCMD.



- 11 -
2.13       Administrative procedures within the RCMD are generally cumbersome,
in particular for procurement matters. This often leads to unnecessary delays
in equipment repairs, even if spares are available locally.  Although the Gov-
ernment has already taken some measures to simplify procedures, additional
measures need to be taken, Procedures for procurement of IDA-financed goods
have now been well established and do not cause major difficulties.
2.14       In the course of time there have been frequent changes in the man-
agement of RCMD, as well as in lower staff positions. RCMD generally lacks
qualified and experienced medium and lower level staff, resulting in an over-
worked high level staff, which is involved in solving daily problems and
cannot devote enough time to longer-term issues. The recruitment of new,
qualified staff and training of present RCMD personnel and adequate Technical
Assistance is therefore of high priority.
2.15      Technical Assistance under the two previous projects has been
designed to strengthen RCMD capabilities in project identification, prepara-
tion and implementation. The country has thus been exposed to the methodolo-
gies of evaluating highway investments, which represents an important step
towards establishing an adequate highway planning system in the country.
Significant improvements in some areas, such as road inventory, budgetary
allocation, systematic traffic surveys, etc, were made by RCMD as a con-
sequence of Technical Assistance, but in general terms much has still to be
done to fully implement the system. The absorptive capacity of RCMD is
limited, and therefore the progress in the system implementation is slow.
D.   Planning
2.16      Longer term planning, taking into account economic considerations,
was initiated by consultants under the First Highway Project. Under the
Second Highway Project, the concept of the economic evaluation of highway
projects was further widened by the feasibility studies of two road projects,
carried out by consultants. The planning mechanism will be further strength-
ened under the proposed project as explained in para. 1.14. At present the
remaining part of the highway plan for 1976-83 is being modified to reflect
the priorities set by the new Government.  The new plan is to cover the
period 1979-83.
E.   Financing
2.17       Road construction and maintenance is financed from the general bud-
get.  Total expenditures for roads, excluding the RDD roads, amounted to
US$31.9 million in 1976 (Table T-1), including about US$8.0 million for main-
tenance, improvement and pavement strengthening. There is no consistent trend
in the annual expenditures for highways, but they increased markedly in 1975
and 1976.
2.18       The RCMD has started recently to estimate budget allocations on the
basis of a detailed cost breakdown of field operations. The expenditures
projected for maintenance, road improvements and the strengthening program in
the project area for the period mid-1980 to mid-1983 (the execution period of
the proposed project) are estimated at about US$39 million, or about US$13
million annually.



- 12 -
F.   Engineering
2.19      The Engineering Department in RCMD is responsible for the design of
new roads and bridges and also acts as an advisor to provincial and local
authorities. The design standards for new roads, developed under the First
Highway Project (Annex 2), are satisfactory. Because of the difficult terrain
the roads do not always adhere to the chosen standards, but are adapted to the
local situation. The main highways, financed with assistance from the USA
and USSR, were built before uniform design standards were established. Their
standards differ therefore somewhat from the present Afghan standards.
G.   Construction
2.20       There are no Afghan construction firms capable of constructing major
roads. The Government does not encourage private contracting firms and only
one of the domestic publicly owned firms is capable of carrying out earthworks
of some magnitude; at best, if the opportunity were to arise, this firm might
be able to operate under a joint-venture arrangement with a foreign firm.
2.21       In the mid-sixties, the main roads financed by the USA were built
by USA contractors. Since then, because of the absence of any domestic con-
tracting capabilities and the reluctance of Government to engage foreign
contractors, new roads have normally been built by the Army Labor Corps, under
supervision of the MPW. Only recently has the Government been considering
the construction of a road in the Helmand Valley with financing by the Asian
Development Bank, by a contractor from the Philippines. In exceptional cases,
the RCMD has built some minor roads, but it usually handles road improvements
only. The RDD builds only rural roads carrying very low traffic volumes.
H.   Highway Maintenance and Improvement
2.22       The MPW has overall responsibility for highway maintenance.  The
Road Maintenance General Directorate of RCMD is responsible for the main-
tenance of the highways in the Eastern, Southern and Western Regions, and the
MPW for maintenance in the Northern Region, with some assistance from the
USSR. Except for some 300 km of track which are being upgraded by the Army
Labor Corps, the RCMD is responsible for the maintenance of the roads, as
shown in Table 2.1.
2.23       Road maintenance operations are planned and directed from Kabul
and executed by the nine district branch offices (see Chart C-1). With the
completion by the end of 1979 of a highway maintenance center in Kabul (para.
1.17), the Works Division, which carries the direct responsibility for high-
way maintenance, will be in a better position to organize and supervise
its operations. The center will comprise the RCMD's administrative office,
central workshops, warehouses for spare parts, a soils and materials labora-
tory, and a training center. Besides the main mechanical workshop in Kabul,
there is a lesser-equipped workshop in Kandahar while the other districts
have only facilities for minor repairs and regular equipment maintenance.
2.24       Road maintenance has improved under the two previous IDA-financed
projects (paras. 1.16 and 1.17). At present the main paved roads under the



- 13 -
RCMD's responsibility are reasonably well maintained.  The secondary and
tertiary roads are, in general, maintained according to the traffic they
carry, which is acceptable. Tracks are rarely maintained, but a reasonable
effort to improve them gradually is under way. In sum, the current main-
tenance effort should be continued, with the expectation that as the RCMD
gains more experience, the efficiency and the quantity of maintenance opera-
tions should improve. The proposed project is designed to support these
objectives.
I.   Training
2.25      A beginning was made by consultants under the First Highway Project
with the training of the RCMD's staff and personnel. Consultants under the
Second Highway Project have continued with some training courses, but without
much active support by higher authorities. However, in early 1978, the Plan-
ning Division in RCMD has been made responsible for training under a newly
appointed Training Director. In view of the continuing need for better-
skilled personnel the RCMD wishes to reactivate the training with the help
of local instructors and with possible assistance under bilateral agreement.
During negotiations, views were exchanged on RCMD's proposed training program,
the arrangements for its execution and the coordination with the on-the-job
training through the proposed project.
III. THE PROJECT
A.   Objectives
3.01      The proposed project will support the Government's aims and policy
to maintain and gradually improve the highway network. It places emphasis on
protecting present investments rather than on new construction. To this end,
the proposed project will:
(i)  consolidate the improvements made in the maintenance of the
highway network under the two previous highway projects;
(ii) help to further stimulate the development of rural areas by
upgrading access roads to these areas; and
(iii) help the highway organization to improve its capability to
plan and to carry out highway maintenance and improvement
works.
B.   Description
3.02      The project consists of:
(i)   a three-year time slice of a pavement strengthening and
preservation program;



- 14 -
(ii)   a three-year time slice of a road maintenance and improve-
ment program; and
(iii) technical assistance for RCMD.
Pavement Strengthening and Preservation
3.03       Some 670 km of asphalt paved highway comprising about 420 km of the
492 km Kabul-Kandahar road, about 150 km of the 224 km Kabul-Torkham (Pakistan
border) road and about 100 km of the 105 km Kandahar-Spin Boldak (Pakistan
border) road are in various stages of pavement deterioration, ranging from
first signs of failures to near disintegration.  These primary routes, which
carry some of the highest traffic volumes in the country, were constructed or
improved to paved standard in the first half of the sixties with assistance
from USAID. Their design was based on the principle of stage construction,
involving timely pavement strengthening.
3.04      Notwithstanding routine maintenance, some periodic maintenance
and strengthening of some 110 km of the worst sections under the First and
Second Highway Projects, strengthening and preservation of the pavements of
these highways has now become a high priority need. The proposed project
would therefore include a program of strengthening by means of asphaltic
concrete overlays of about 450 km out of the estimated total of 670 km over
a three-year period. Of the remaining 220 km about 160 km will receive a
surface treatment (double surface dressing) to prevent the intrusion of water,
thus preserving the road surface.
3.05      The road sections to be treated will be selected on the basis of
technical and economic considerations which take into account the present
condition of the pavement and the expected future traffic loads.  Depending
on the thicknesses that are ultimately required for the overlays, the total
length of the sections to be strengthened may differ from the presently esti-
mated length of 450 km, whereas the road length to be surface dressed may
also vary from the presently estimated 160 km after all tests on soils and
materials have been completed.
3.06      Part of the equipment for the pavement strengthening program, in-
cluding a 60 ton/hr asphalt mixing plant, has been provided under the First
and Second Highway Projects. On the basis of the available engineering data
a total of about 450,000 tons of asphaltic concrete will be required for the
projected 450 km of overlays.  Since this amount is beyond the capacity of the
present unit within the given time frame, additional equipment for a second
asphalt production and laying unit is included under the proposed project.
Road Maintenance and Improvements
3.07       Under the First Highway Project and the ongoing Second Highway
Project, the Association has financed mechanical equipment and spare parts
for road maintenance and for road improvements in the Eastern, Southern
and Western regions. Technical assistance under these projects helped RCMD
to develop related maintenance and improvement plans and programs to improve
its organizational and operational ability to undertake maintenance works.



- 15 -
Under the proposed project, RCMD would continue to maintain its road network
and upgrade some 300 km of tracks to improved earth roads. To help RCMD to
continue its maintenance and improvement program after the Second Highway
Project is completed at the end of 1979, the proposed project would finance
US$2.4 million (including price increases) for new mechanical equipment and
US$3.3 million (including price increases) for spare parts for existing equip-
ment, financed under the two previous highway projects. The new equipment
will replace equipment which is beyond repair. Technical assistance will be
provided under the proposed project to continue the institutional improvements
initiated and developed under the First Highway Project and the ongoing Second
Highway Project (para. 3.09).
Technical Assistance to RCMD
3.08      The proposed technical assistance would be a vital input to the
pavement strengthening and to the road maintenance and improvement programs.
For this reason the effectiveness of a contract between the Government and the
Consultants will be a condition to the effectiveness of the Credit Agreement.
The technical assistance consists of:
Man-months
1 highway engineering and transportation
expert (team leader)                             36
1 cost accountant                                   18
1 hot-mix plant specialist                         24
1 asphalt laboratory technician                     12
90
3.09      The technical assistance team's function is to help RCMD in the
planning and execution of the pavement strengthening program and in the devel-
opment of the necessary skills of its staff through on-the-job training. The
team leader would coordinate the work of the technical assistance team and be
ultimately responsible for the quality and quantity control of the production
and laying of asphaltic concrete (para. 3.35). He would also be available to
assist RCMD in its highway planning (para. 1.14) and advise the Government in
matters of road transport policies (para. 1.11).
3.10      The cost accountant's function will be to design and help implement
a cost accounting system for the production and laying of asphaltic concrete
for overlays. Since the production and laying of asphaltic concrete can be
relatively easily monitored, it is also a suitable item to introduce the con-
cept of cost accounting in general and to serve as a pilot project for the
setting up of a more comprehensive system for all of RCMD's activities.
3.11      The hot-mix plant specialist and the asphalt laboratory technician
would assist RCMD in the daily operation of the two mixing plants. During
negotiations RCMD indicated that it expected to be able to provide the consul-
tants with the services of two Afghan laboratory technicians. It was agreed
that the consultants would examine their qualifications and experience before
submitting a proposal.



- 16 -
3.12      RCMD has also indicated that it intends to assign to the Consultants
a cost accountant and a hot-mix plant, foreman from its own staff with the
purpose to take over the functions of the respective consultants' staff as
soon as possible.  The assignment of the accountant and hot-mix plant spe-
cialist, employed by the Consultants, may therefore be shortened to 12 months,
respectively 16 months, if the Afghan staff will have gained sufficient expe-
rience after these periods.
C.   Engineering
3.13      The overlay program will be based on an adequate pavement overlay
design.  To enable the Association to determine the ability of RCMD to engineer
pavement overlays, it has submitted the detailed pavement overlay design for
a 50 km section ofthe Kabul-Kandahar road and a preliminary design for the
Kabul-Torkham road and the remaining part of the Kabul-Kandahar road. RCMD's
methodology for the overlay design is acceptable and it is proceeding with the
detailed design of the remaining 400 km.
3.14      Out of the 670 km of roads in various shapes of pavement deteriora-
tion about 450 km have been identified for an asphaltic concrete overlay and
about 160 km for a surface treatment. The final selection for the three-year
time slice will be based on completed detailed pavement overlay design and
also on economic considerations. The methodology for the overlay design has
been established (para. 3.13). An understanding was reached during negotia-
tions on the methodology to be used for the economic evaluation of the pave-
ment overlays. It was further agreed that, before commencing any pavement
works, the RCMD shall provide the Association with a technical and economic
justification for the overlay or surface treatment of each road section
satisfactory to the Association.
3.15      The engineering and economic studies of the pavement overlays will
be submitted far enough ahead of the actual pavement works to avoid delays in
their execution. Because the rate at which the roads deteriorate with time
gives valuable information, the engineering should also not be too far ahead
of the actual pavement works. The proposed method of submitting the justifica-
tion gradually will therefore make it possible to adapt the overlays to the
latest available information.
3.16      Except for the Kandahar - Spin Boldak road the alignment, cross
section and grade of the roads are adequate. No engineering is therefore
required other than completion of the pavement overlay design.  Presently
the only work anticipated for the Kandahar - Spin Boldak road is a surface
treatment of a 35 km section leading out of Kandahar for which no engineering
is required.  Any asphaltic concrete overlay that may be proposed by RCMD for
the remaining part of this road should be considered in the light of frequent
flooding of the road in low lying areas. More elaborate engineering by RCMD
would therefore be required if any works are proposed for the sections subject
to flooding.
D. Cost Estimates
3.17       The overall project cost estimates are in Table 3.1 (see page 17)
which also shows the proposed financing arrangements. Table 3.2 shows the re-
current costs of the three-year time slice for the road maintenance and
improvement program.

3.18       The cost of pavement strengthening is based on a total production
of 450,000-ton asphaltic concrete for overlays, to be produced by 2 asphalt
mixing plants, with a total nominal capacity of 140 ton/hour and working with
an efficiency of 85% for 7 hours/day. It is assumed that the operations will
last 3 years with a working season of 180 days per year. Depending on the
ultimate thickness of the overlays the final length to be strengthened may
vary from the assumed 450 km (para. 3.05). Highway maintenance represents
a three-year time slice of RCMD's program and highway improvement refers to
the upgrading of about 300 km of tracks to improved earth roads (para. 3.07).
E.   Financing
3.19      The proposed overall external financing arrangements are shown in
Table 3.1. As indicated in the table, IDA financing would amount to US$17.6
million, whereas US$4.4 million would be financed by the EEC Action Fund.
The details for the parallel financing were discussed during negotiations.
Details of the specific items proposed for IDA and EEC financing are:
Pavement Strengthening and Preservation
3.20      Mechanical equipment for the second asphalt mixing and laying unit
(para. 3.06) would be financed by IDA and consists of:

3.21       External financing of the pavement strengthening will be effected
through disbursements for equipment for the second asphalt unit (IDA), for
the purchase of an initial quantity of asphaltic bitumen for pavement strength-
ening (EEC) and for IDA's contribution (US$17.50 per ton asphaltic concrete,
paras. 3.42 and 3.43) to the remaining cost of asphaltic bitumen required for
the pavement strengthening, and to the cost of equipment maintenance, mate-
rials and site overheads. The initial quantity of asphaltic bitumen, valued
at US$2.7 million (excluding price increases) and to be financed through the
EEC Action Fund, will be sufficient to cover the first year of production of
asphaltic concrete. During that period RCMD will receive US$17.50 per ton
asphaltic concrete mixed and placed and thus collect the funds for the pur-
chase of additional asphaltic bitumen to continue the operations after the
first year. Asphalt for surface dressing will be entirely financed by IDA as
a separate item.
3.22       Fuels are excluded from the IDA financing because they are imported
from the USSR under a Government monopoly.
Highway Maintenance and Improvements Program
3.23       IDA and EEC financing for new equipment will be for the following
items:
Table 3.4: NEW EQUIPMENT FOR HIGHWAY MAINTENANCE AND IMPROVEMENT
In US$
13 bulldozers                                                1,170,000
4 motor graders                                                240,000

4 water tankers                                                 80,000
1,830,000
Spares, 15% of equipment value                                 270,000
Base Cost                                                    2,100,000
Price increases                                                300,000
Total                                                        2,400,000
Of this amount IDA would finance US$1.1 million (base cost) and the EEC Action
Fund US$1.0 million (base cost).
3.24    IDA would finance the cost of spare parts for existing equipment,
amounting to US$3.3 million (including price increases), of which US$1.6 mil-
lion for spares for equipment purchased under the First Highway Project and
about US$1.7 million for spares purchased under the Second Highway Project.
Technical Assistance
3.25       IDA would finance the foreign costs of technical assistance, as
specified in Table 3.5.

1 Highway engineering and transportation expert
(team leader):  36 man-months at US$7,000/month              252,000

Price increases                                               119,000
Total Foreign Cost                                            670,000
3.26      The average base foreign cost per man-month amounts to about
US$6,100 (including cost of transportation) and reflects the price level of
early 1979 for recruitment on a worldwide basis.
3.27      The proposed IDA Credit of US$17.6 million would cover 62% of the
total foreign cost. Since US$2.9 million (including price contingencies,
Table 3.1) of the foreign cost represents fuel, which is excluded from IDA
financing (para. 3.22), the Association would finance 69% of that part of the
foreign cost which is eligible for IDA financing.
3.28      The EEC Action Fund would contribute US$4.4 million (15% of the
foreign cost). The Government's contribution of US$11.2 million consists of
US$6.5 million foreign cost and US$4.7 million local cost. The tax component
of the local cost is negligible because the import of equipment and materials
for foreign financed projects is exempt from taxes and fuel is not taxed in
Afghanistan.
3.29      During Credit negotiations, the project cost estimates were dis-
cussed and confirmed with the Government. Assurances were obtained from the
Government that it will provide all of the financing, both foreign and local,
not covered by the Association and the EEC, and all other resources needed to
complete the project on a timely basis.
F.   Implementation
3.30      There has been little recent history of highway construction work in
Afghanistan by international contractors. The landlocked and remote location,
lack of assured long-term construction programs and the role seen for the
state in the economy are the main reasons for this situation. Past experience
with IDA financed irrigation and water supply projects has also demonstrated
the lack of interest from international contractors for civil engineering work



- 21 -
in Afghanistan. Similarly, lack of demand combined with Government's urge
to use its own resources has mitigated against the development of local
contractors who could undertake asphalt paving works.
3.31       Under the on-going Second Highway Project, RCMD has gained valuable
experience of asphaltic concrete production and laying. Whilst inefficiencies
and deficiencies exist in the RCMD operation in this area, an adequate base
of experience does exist which could and should be built upon to provide an
in-country ability to carry out this essential maintenance operation.
3.32       In light of this situation, the Government has proposed to carry out
the pavement strengthening through RCMD's own forces. A vital aspect of this
procedure is the technical assistance to assure a smooth running-in period of
the pavement operations. Whilst the use of ICB procedures to attempt to induce
a foreign contractor to undertake the paving works may seem a reasonable alter-
native, experience indicates otherwise. For a road in the Helmand Valley, West
of Kandahar, bids through ICB procedures were received in 1975. The Govern-
ment and the financing agency (Asian Development Bank) rejected all the bids
because of high prices. Three contractors participated in January 1977 in the
rebidding, but the bids were again considered to be too high. Negotiations
with the lowest bidder, a firm from the Philippines, resulted in a lower
offer but at the time of appraisal, (September 1978) a contract was still not
awarded. Attempted use of ICB procedures for the pavement strengthening works
in the proposed project would most likely lead to a similar long protracted
and abortive bidding procedure during which time the vital paved roads will
further deteriorate.
3.33       The implementation of the paving works and the related part of the
implementation schedule (Annex 3) are therefore based on the paving works
being carried out by RCMD forces. Since 50 km of overlay design has been
completed, sufficient of the first year's program has been engineered to
enable an early start to be made with the overlay works, utilizing the pre-
sently available asphaltic concrete mixing plant. The award of a contract
for technical assistance to assist the RCMD in setting up and operating the
unit will be a condition to the effectiveness of the Credit Agreement (para.
3.08). The importance of having the technical assistance team available as
soon as possible after Credit signing for an early beginning of the overlay
works was specifically raised with the Government during negotiations.
3.34       In addition to the paving works, the implementation schedule shows
the detailed timing of the other project items which will be necessary for
satisfactory project implementation, all of which were discussed and confirmed
at negotiations.
Detailed Implementation Schedule
3.35       RCMD will be responsible for the efficient use of the Technical
Assistance team. In respect of quality control of the production and laying
of asphaltic concrete for the road strengthening program, the team leader of
the technical assistance team will have to be satisfied and certify accord-
ingly, for the purpose of disbursement, that the works have been executed in



- 22 -
accordance with the design and specifications and to generally acceptable
engineering standards.  Since the team leader's function as advisor to RCMD
and at the same time as supervisor of work executed by the same agency could
lead to conflicts between the technical assistance team and RMCD, the tech-
nical assistance team will be employed under a contract administered by the
MPW.
3.36      The establishment of quality control is considered vital to the
satisfactorily carrying out of the paving works. During Credit negotiations
assurances were obtained that the paving works will be certified both as to
quality and quantity by the team leader as a condition of disbursement of the
Credit funds directly applied to the asphaltic concrete.
G.   Procurement
3.37      As indicated in para. 3.33, the pavement strengthening works will
be carried out by the RCMD forces. The procurement of IDA-financed equipment
will be through ICB procedures according to the Bank's "Guidelines for Pro-
curement." Procurement of equipment financed by the EEC Action Fund will be
in accordance with the Action Fund's guidelines and were discussed with Gov-
ernment during negotiations.  Spare parts for existing equipment will be
purchased from the original manufacturer or through international shopping.
3.38      To assist the RCMD in the financing of asphaltic bitumen for the
overlay works, an initial quantity, valued at US$2.7 million (excluding price
increases), will be financed by the EEC Special Action Fund (para. 3.21)
and procured in accordance with its guidelines. The remaining quantity
of asphaltic bitumen will not be financed as a separate item, but will be
financed through IDA's contribution of US$17.50 per ton asphaltic concrete
mixed and placed.
3.39      Because asphaltic bitumen represents 30% of the total cost of the
pavement strengthening works, procurement through international competitive
bidding (ICB) according to the Bank's "Guidelines for Procurement" will be
required in order to minimize costs. Asphalt for surface dressing will also
be procured through ICB according to the Bank's "Guidelines for Procurement".
Assurances to this effect were obtained during negotiations.
3.40      The technical assistance will be provided by qualified and expe-
rienced specialists on terms and conditions all acceptable to the Association.
During negotiations assurances were given by the Government to this effect.
In addition, the numbers and types of experts were discussed and confirmed
during negotiations.
H.   Disbursements
3.41      Disbursements from the Credit account and EEC Special Action Fund
account will be made on the basis of:
-    100% of the foreign cost (CIF Kabul) of equipment and spare
parts;



- 23 -
-    100% of the foreign cost of an initial quantity of asphaltic
bitumen for pavement strengthening to a value of US$2.7 mil-
lion (excluding price increases);
-    100% of the foreign cost of consultants' services; and
-    US$17.50 per ton of asphaltic concrete, mixed and placed
according to standards acceptable and certified as such by
the consultants in charge of quality and quantity control.
3.42      Disbursement for pavement strengthening would be made on the basis
of a fixed amount (US$17.50) per ton asphaltic concrete, mixed and placed,
since this would be an incentive for RCMD to efficiently carry out the work.
Any cost increase because of inefficient operations would have to be borne by
RCMD and any substandard execution could lead to rejection by the supervising
consultant. Also, there would be an incentive to produce and place asphaltic
concrete as soon as the mixing plants are operational, the crushers installed
and the initial quantity of asphalt has arrived on site. The proposed arrange-
ment will make project supervision by IDA more complex. However, the advantage
of providing an incentive to RCMD to efficiently produce and deliver a qualita-
tively acceptable end product will outweigh the disadvantage of a more inten-
sive supervision on the part of the Association.
3.43      The amount of US$17.50 per ton for asphaltic concrete is derived
from IDA's contribution of US$7.9 million (US$6.3 million base cost plus
US$1.6 million for price increase) for the production and laying of 450,000
tons of asphaltic concrete.
3.44      The following estimated schedule of disbursements was discussed and
confirmed with Government during negotiations. Any funds expected to remain
in the IDA Credit account after project completion would be cancelled. Any
balance remaining in the account of the EEC Action Fund would be used for the
purchase of equipment for road maintenance and improvement in accordance with
the Action Fund's guidelines for procurement.

I.   Environmental Impact
3.45      The pavement strengthening will not detrimentally affect the envi-
ronment. The maintenance and upgrading of rural roads will improve the rural
environment by providing better access to markets, schools and medical facil-
ities.
IV. ECONOMIC EVALUATION
A.   Benefits and Beneficiaries
4.01      The pavement strengthening program, which is the main item under the
proposed project, is designed to prevent deterioration of vital sections of
primary roads which are part of the backbone of Afghanistan's domestic and
international transport system. These roads carry significant traffic volumes
since they serve important centers of economic activity in the country. They
were mostly built in the sixties and their pavement structures are now too
weak for the traffic they carry. Unless remedial action is taken to upgrade
this vital means of transportation to meet present and future transport
requirements, the roads would break up even with intensive maintenance,
transport costs would rise, traffic would be interrupted, the economy would



- 25 -
suffer, and the Government would ultimately have to face costly reconstruction
works. The proposed strengthening program would prevent these adverse effects
and would benefit the economy by keeping these roads open to traffic, reducing
the cost of transport and maintenance, and avoiding costly reconstruction
works. The preservation program will also be applied to sections of primary
roads and will make it possible to preserve the existing pavements and to
postpone the strengthening of those sections.
4.02      The Government is carrying out satisfactorily a greatly needed main-
tenance program and a well justified program of road improvements under two
previous IDA Credits (paras. 1.16 and 1.17). In support of these programs,
IDA financed about US$12 million of highway equipment. At present, spare
parts are needed to keep this equipment functioning, estimated at a cost of
about US$3.3 million and included for financing under the proposed Credit.
The benefits of these purchases, although difficult to quantify, would be the
value of production foregone from the loss in output of equipment standing
idle for lack of spare parts.
4.03      The present condition of some secondary and tertiary roads does not
economically satisfy the transport demand; many roads have substandard charac-
teristics and lack the capacity to handle the traffic they carry at reasonable
overall transport cost. The proposed purchases of mechanical equipment would
enable the Government to improve these roads. This would benefit the economy
by providing better access and reducing the cost of transport.
4.04      The technical assistance component of the proposed project is con-
sidered to be essential to ensure an adequate and timely execution of the
project pavement strengthening program and has been considered as part of the
cost of that program. At the same time it will continue the process of insti-
tution building and on-the-job training of RCMD staff, started in the two
previous projects.
4.05      Beneficiaries.  The principal direct beneficiaries will be th2 road
users, by avoiding the higher costs of transport as Lhe roads deteriorate.
However, because of keen competition in the transport industry, especially on
the primary network, it is expected that these savings in transport costs
accruing to truckers and other transport intermediaries will be passed on
gradually to producers, consumers and the Government. As an average, a high
75% of the traffic volumes on paved roads are buses and trucks, whose operat-
i-ig costs are about two or three times the corresponding values for passenger
cars. Therefore, about 90% of the benefits will accrue to work and business-
related traffic. The Government will also directly benefit from the proposed
project in sa-ings in maintenance and reconstruction costs, which are espe-
cially hign frr asphalt paved roads, and indirectly from the continuation of
institution building through technical assistance.
B.   Economi  Eva&.uation
(i) Strengtnening and Preservation of Primary Asphalt-Paved Roads
4.06       To ascertain the feasibility of the full 670 km of pavement strength-
ening from which the 450 km in the three-year time slice of the proposed proj-
ect have been selected, it was assumed that each of the sections in the program



- 26 -
will require an overlay of 7.5 cm thickness, which is the most costly solution;
certain sections will probably require a thinner overlay.  On this concept and
based on the present and projected traffic, the economic returns on individual
sections range from a minimum of 19% to a maximum of 59%, with an overall
return of 34%, as shown below. All sections also show an acceptable first-
year return. Details of the analysis are in the Project File.

/1   Assumed thickness of 7.5 cm.
4.07      As indicated in para. 3.14 the Government will submit a technical/
economic study for each section in the three-year time slice for approval by
the Association, prior to the start of any works. These studies are to be
prepared on the basis of detailed pavement design and according to an agreed
methodology and criteria (Annex 4). Each section will have a rate of return
of at least 12%, which is considered to be an acceptable estimat'e of the
minimum attractive rate of return in Afghanistan. Assurances oln this point
were obtained during negotiations.
4.08      The agreed methodology calls for an evaluation of alternative
strengthening options, including stage construction such as for example, a
comparison of overlays at five-year intervals with overlays at ren-year
intervals. However, the former option does not seem to be practical under
conditions prevailing in Afghanistan, principally because of the additional
cost of moving plant, equipment and labor force to another site and because
of the extra burdens it would impose on the administration in pLanning and
implementing the program.
4.09      The preservation program will preserve the existing pavement and
will permit the strengthening to be delayed. Assuming the delay is 3 years,
the benefit/cost ratio instead of doing the overlay now is 1.2.



- 27 -
(ii) Road Maintenance and Improvement Program
4.10      The proposed project would include a three-year slice of a road
maintenance and improvement program, as explained in para. 3.02. This program
would continue and consolidate the improvements in planning, organization,
and execution of maintenance and improvements started under the previous high-
way projects. Although the Government is likely to continue this program,
even if no IDA financing were available, for purposes of determining the basis
for evaluating the economic benefits of this program, it has been assumed that,
without the program, the maintenance effort would be reduced to a minimum.
Traffic has been estimated to grow at an annual rate of 10% during the six-
year period covered by the analysis from mid-1980 to mid-1986. This growth
rate is in line with the increase of traffic in recent years and has also been
adopted in several feasibility studies. Benefits from the program are reduced
transport costs and savings in avoided rehabilitation, which would become
necessary ultimately if the maintenance effort were reduced. Details of the
economic evaluation are in the Project File. On this basis, the ER was esti-
mated at 70% and the benefit/cost ratio at 2.3.
(iii) Technical Assistance
4.11      As indicated in para. 4.04, technical assistance is a critical
element for the appropriate execution of the project and its economic justi-
fication is dependent on that of the pavement strengthening anld maintenance
programs.
(iv) Overall Economic Return
4.12      Under the conservative assumption that all the road links in the
pavement strengthening program would require a thickness of 7.5 cm, the over-
all ER of the pavement strengthening and preservation program and of the road
maintenance and improvement program together would be 42%.  Since at least
some of the links will require a lesser thickness, the overall ER will be
higher.
C.   Projects Risks
4.13      There is a risk that delays may occur in the execution of the pave-
ment strengthening program, because of delays in the procurement of the second
asphaltic concrete production unit, the procurement of asphalt bitumen, or the
employment of the technical assistance consultants. Although these delays
should not affect the economic returns materially, the country would forego
the benefits to be derived from the program during the period of delay.
V. AGREEMENTS REACHED AND RECOMMENDATIONS
5.01      During Credit negotiations agreement was reached on the following
principal matters:



- 28 -
(i) the effectiveness of a contract between the Government
and the Consultants will be an additional condition to
the effectiveness of the Credit Agreement (para. 3.08);
and
(ii) before commencing any pavement works the RCMD will provide
the Association with a satisfactory technical and economic
justification for the overlay or surface treatment of each
road section (para. 3.14).
5.02      The project is suitable for an IDA Credit of US$17.6 million equiva-
lent and for an EEC Action Fund Credit of US$4.4 million equivalent to the
Government of the Democratic Republic of Afghanistan on the usual terms.

STAFF APPRAISAL REPORT OF
A THIRD HIGHWAY PROJECT
AFGHANISTAN
Methodology for the Economic Evaluation of Strengthening the
Pavement of the Kabul-Kandahar-Spin Boldak and Kabul-Torkham Roads
A. Introduction
1.        The objective of the economic evaluation of road strengthening proj-
ects (or of any other kind of investment) is to determine the alternative
pavement strength and frequency resulting in minimum total cost of society,
including the cost to road users as well as the cost borne by the highway
authority.
B. Alternatives
2.        For purposes of evaluating the proposed road strengthening projects
for Bank financing it will be necessary to determine what are the "real" 1/
alternatives. One of course is the "do nothing" solution. Others might be
overlays of different thicknesses, increasing the thickness of the crushed
stone base course, etc. Stage construction, including the frequency of suc-
cessive overlays, shall be carefully investigated to define the optimum timing
of the works. All "reasonable" or "reasonably possible" solutions should be
considered.
C. Economic Costs
3.        After identifying "real" alternatives, their (economic) costs should
be considered.  These costs may be considered in three categories.  The first
is the direct investment (construction) cost, the second is maintenance cost,
and the third, user costs (i.e. direct costs to the users of the roadway).
The preferred alternative must be the least total cost alternative, which will
be determined in terms of present value based on the opportunity cost of
capital (see para. 8). After the least cost solution has been determined,
its economic return, expressed as the internal rate of return, should be esti-
mated by comparison with the "without" solution, as explained in para. 5 below.
1/   "Real" in terms of practical, authentic, sensible solutions.

4.        Considering that there are practically no alternative routes to the
analyzed roads, traffic diversion as a consequence of different conditions of
the road is estimated to be minimal, if any. Therefore, traffic volumes, can
be assumed to remain the same for all analyzed alternatives of each section,
and its growth would also be independent of the studied alternative. Another
simplifying assumption would be to disregard generated traffic because vehicle
operating costs are not expected to be affected substantially under the
strengthening program, during the first few years.
D. Economic Benefits
5.        Once the least cost alternative is determined, then the second step
is to measure the benefits which can be expected to accrue to the Afghani
economy as a whole from the planned investment. As a practical matter, bene-
fits are generally measured for this type of improvement as user cost savings
plus any differences, positive or negative, in maintenance costs. The ques-
tion is, what alternative (to the proposed improvement) should be considered
as the "basis" for evaluation. It appears logical to consider costs to the
user (plus differences in maintenance costs) with the road "strengthened," and
costs that would occur in the "do nothing" or "basis", solution, and which
should only include the cost of normal maintenance operations.
6.        To determine user cost savings, vehicle operating costs of typical
vehicles should be determined for the project alternatives and for the "do
nothing" solution. Vehicle operating costs should include items such as fuel,
oil and lubrication, tyre wear, vehicle maintenance, depreciation, overheads,
and crew. All costs should be priced at its economic value, that is without
taxes and subsidies. To determine the influence of the road surface condition
on vehicle operating costs, tables 508 and 509 of the Highway Maintenance
Program, Stage II 1973-1977, Final Report prepared by Kampsax in June 1973,
could be used. Specifically, considerations should be given to the trade-off
between increasing regular maintenance and the subsequent decrease in vehicle
operating costs.
E. Optimum Timing
7.        The economic analysis should also include an investigation of the
optimum timing of the analyzed strengthening work. As a criteria, the project
should be executed at the right time when the first year return 1/ becomes
greater than the opportunity cost of capital.
8.        An opportunity cost of capital of 12% probably is about right and
should be used in all economic calculations.
1/   The ratio of first-year benefit over capital costs.
