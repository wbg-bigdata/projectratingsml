MEMORANDUM AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT
OF THE
INTERNATIONAL BANK FOR RECONSTRUCTION AND DEVELOPMENT
TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS
ON A PROPOSED
PUBLIC SECTOR REFORM TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE LOAN (PSRTAL)
TO THE REPUBLIC OF ARGENTINA
1.          The following memorandum and recommendation on a proposed loan to
the Republic of Argentina for US$23.0 million equivalent la submitted for your
approval. The loan will be on standard IBRD terms repayable over 17 years,
including 5 years of grace, at the Bank's standard variable rate. It would
help finance a Public Sector Reform Technical Assistance Project.
2.          Background.  Argentina's fiscal deficit has been a principal cause
of macroeconomic instability and its eliminatLon requires the implementation
of fundamental public sector reforms. The economic program of the Government
comprises a set of structural reforms of the Federal Government and the
Central Bank (the PSR program) which will be supported by the Bank through
this Loan, and a proposed Public Sector Reform Loan (PSRL). The PSRL would
contribute to the design and financing of measures to improve the efficiency
of current and investment expenditures, increase revenues while reducing the
distortions in revenue mobilization, and limit recourse to money creation by
disengaging the Central Bank from public finances and creating an independent
monetary authority with limited powers. Bank technical assistance has already
been instrumental in the design of policy improvements and strengthening key
agencies, however, additional technical support is needed to strengthen the
government's capacity to implement the reform.
3.          Rationale for Bank Involvement.  Supporting public sector reform
is a fundamental Bank objective in Argentina. The recently approved Public
Enterprise Reform Adjustment and Execution Loans (PERAL/PEREL) would provide
vital financial assistance and technical support to the Government reform
program in this area. The proposed PSRTAL would strengthen the administrative
and technical capabillities of the National Administration (Central Government,
Special Accounts, and Decentralized Organizations) to carry out the reforms
being supported by the PSRL. The project would extend on activities carried
out under the Bank's 1986 Public Sector Management Technical Assistance Loan
(Ln. 2712-AR), one of whose aims was to develop an analytical basis for the
reform of the public sector. Specifically, the proposed project would
generate required institutional strengthening of the key agencies responsible
for implementing those reforms. Without the support proposed under PSRTAL,
vital reforms--such as the implementation of comprehensive financial
management improvements of the public sector, a modern institutional framework
for control, an effective internal administration of the Central Government,
an efficient administration of customs, and the reorganization and
modernization of the Central Bank and the Superintendency of Financial
Entities (SEF)--would be much less likely to proceed as planned by the
Government given the austere fiscal environment. As part of the collaborative
effort with the Argentine Government in preparing the PSRL, the Bank has been
significantly involved in the design of the reform measures now under
implementation in these areas.

4.          Proiect Obiectives.  The proposed PSRTAL will support:
(a) modernization and computerization of the Customs Department
(Administraci6n Nacional de AMuanas-ANA); (b) administrative reform and
modernization of internal administration of the Central Government;
(c) establishment of a new framework and development of systems for
comprehensive public sector financial management, integrated budgetary
processes and effective control for improved allocation of public resources;
(d) the reorganization and modernization of the Central Bank; and (e)
implementation of a program fer a complete restructuring of the SEF.
S.          Proiect DescriPtLon.  The proposed project would strengthen the
capacity ofs
(a)   the Ministry of Economy by providing consultant services, computer
equipment and software, and loglatical support to (i) manage
economic reforms; (ii) allocate and control public resources by
the design and implementation of an integrated budget and
accounting information system for financial management, budget
programming, execution and control--including institutional
strengthening of the entities that constitute the internal and
external control network; and (iii) administer customs by the
establishment of new administrative procedures and related
computerized information systems;
(b) the Central Government Ministries and the Presidencr by providing
consultant services, computer equipment and software to modernize
its internal administration by developing now uniform procedures
and information systems for personnel, financial resources, and
facilities management;
(c)   the Central Bank through the provision of consultant services,
computer equipment and software to improve its organizational
structure and administrative procedures, develop key information
systems and enhance staff capabilities, with special emphasis on
the SEF.
6.          The matrix of key project activities (Attachment r) includes
information on objectives, activities, outputs, impact, and timing targets.
Evaluation criteria and performance indicators are presented in Attachment It.
The table of activities, inputs, and estimated costs (Attachment 1I1) further
disaggregates the main activities and relates them to project inputs and
costs, and sources of financing. Attachments IV to VIII contain the basic
computerization model that is planned for each project component. The total
project cost is estimated at US$31.5 million equivalent of which US$23.0
million equivalent would be financed by the Bank. The project will be
completed by December 31, 1994, with the closing date of the loan June 30,
1995. Retroactive financing of expenditures made after May 1, 1991 would be
provided up to a maximum of US$1.5 millior equivalent. Selection of
consultanto and procurement of equipment would follow Bank guidelines. The
aggregated cost estimates by component are shown in Schedule A. The
procurement methods and estimated IBRD disbursements appear in Schedule B.
lne timetable of key processing events and the status of Bank Group operations
are shown in Schedules C and 0, respectively. A detalled project description



is given in the Technical Annex. An Executive Summary of the proposed PSRL is
also included as Attachment IX.
7.          Lessons Learned and Proiect Design.  The preparation of the
project has benefitted from previous regional experiences that faced the
following constraints: (a) emphasis on inputs and lack of capacity to complete
the expected outputs and reach the desired technical assistance impact; (b)
soft budget constraints and weak management that allowed the use of resources
for purposes beyond the objectives of the project; (c) widespread
proliferation of individual consultancies that became difficult to control and
costly to administer; and (d) weak counterpart participation and support of
the beneficiary institutions. The design of this project addresses these
constraints, as follows: (a) draws on specific but adaptable action plans and
annual work programs for each component that focus on outputs, define
evaluation criteria and performance indicators to judge project progress, and
identify preconditions for successful implementationt (b) establishes criteria
to improve administration of the project, especially with respect to
procurement; (c) considers that consultant services in most cases will be
pro.,ided by consulting firms or institutions; and (d) emphasizes the
counterpart responsibilities of the beneficiary agencies and, in particular,
staffing of key positions.
S.          Actions Acreed.  During negotiations, agreements were reached on
the action clans for each of the five project components: (a) Customs
Modernization Program; (b) Administrative Reform and Modernization of the
Central Government; (c) Public Sector Comprehensive Financial Management and
Performance Control; (d) Reorganization and Modernization of the Central Bank;
and (e) Reorganization and Modernization of the SEF. Further, the Borrower
and the Bank would agree on specific annual work programs. A condition of
disbursement for any new activities to be financed under the Loan will be
their inclusion in such annual programs. In addition, it was agreed that the
annual work programs would incorporate the following aspects: (a) specific
measures for staffing key positions in the beneficiary institutions; (b)
selection procedures to ensure adequate staff participation in the training
programs; and (c) the actions that will be taken to guarantee sustainability
of the outputs and impact of the Project as its execution ceases. Given the
strong linkage of this project with the PSRL, the following conditions,
originally introduced in the proposed PSRL, were also established for the
PSRTAL: (a) progress on the administrative reform program as delineated in
PSRL, including employment reduction, ministerial reorganization, and an
increase in the salary compression ratio; (b) formulation of the program for
improvement in Customs Administration; (c) presentation to Congress of the
draft Law on Financial Management and Performance Control, the preparation of
which has been assisted by the Bank; (d) a Central Bank reorganization program
as agreed with the Bank; and (e) completion of the restructuring process of
the SEP. During negotiations the Government and the Bank reviewed progress on
implementation of these policy conditions and confirmed that the conditions
have been met. With respect to organization and administration of the
project, the Government will sign a Management Service Agreement Contract with
UNDP-OPS, or another acceptable procurement agency, before Loan effectiveness.
The Government has also stated that it will transfer the existing office
faci.ities and equipment of the Coordinating Unit of the Public Sector
Management Technical Assistance Project (Ln. 2712-AR), upon completion, to the



proposed PSRTAL. Procurement and the contracting of consultants will be
carried out according to Bank guidelines as set forth in Schedule B.
9.          Benefits.  The PSR program is expected to make a significant
contribution in terms of overall economic efficiency gains derived from
increased productivity and effectiveness of the public sector. The PSRTAL
would contribute by strengthening key functions of the institutions in charge
of the economic reform program.
10.         Risks.  The loan faces two risks.  Firgt, progress in achieving
the targets of the PSR program may not be fully satisfactory or proceed more
slowly than desired. In particular, the Government's Administrative Reform
Program might be delayed. This would call into question our technical
assistance activities, since without the reform the project objectives of this
and future operations would be compromised. To lower the impact of this risk,
the proposed loan establishes up-front conditionality in this area. 8econd,
the Government's priorities with respect to the specific TA activities to be
implemented in the various components might change. To minimize this risk,
the disbursement conditions require agreement on action plans, including
specific work programs and terms of reference for each of the project'e five
components.
11.         Recommendation.  I am satisfied that the proposed loan would
comply with the Articles of Agreement of the Bank and recommend that the
Executive Directors approve the proposed loan.

Technical Annex
ARGENTINA
PUBLIC SECTOR REFORM TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE PROJECT
A. BACKGROUND
1.          The proposed Technical Assiatance Loan will support a set of
structural reforms of the Federal Government and the Central Bank being
addressed at a policy level by the proposed Public Sector Reform Loan (PSRL).
The reestablishment of macroeconomic stability in Argentina will require the
implementation of fundamental public sector reforms. The PSRL will contribute
to the design and financing of those measures that would improve the
efficiency of current and investment expenditures, increase revenues while
reducing distortions in revenue mobilization, and limit recourse to money
creation by disengaging the Central Bank from public finances and creating an
independent monetary authority with limited powers.
2.          In Argentina, Bank technical assistance has been instrumental in
the design of economic policies end strengthening related key agencies under
the Public Sector Management and Tax Administration Technical Assistance
Loans. The activities financed under the Public Sector Management Technical
Assistance Project (Loan 2712-AR) developed: (a) an analytical basis for
fundamental reforms that are now being undertaken by the Government with the
support of the PSRTAL in: (i) financial management, budgetary process and
control; (ii) customs administration; and (iii) National Administration
rationalization; and (b) the initial stages of the computerization plans of
the Central Bank and the Superintendency of Financial Entities (8EF). That
Project has also supported the overall design, monitoring, and implementation
of the economic reform program. The Tax Administration Technical Assistance
Project (Loan 3015-AR) is supporting management development and
computerization of the General Tax Office (Direcci6n General Impositiva-D¢I)
to improve revenue collections. The recently approved Public Enterprise
Reform Execution Loan (PEREL) will support: (a) privatization plans of major
PEs in Argentina as well as improvement of the financial viability and service
quality in nonprivatized business units; (b) preparation of further
privatization programs; and (c) strengthening the institutional and regulatory
framework for the sectors in which PEs operate.
B. PROJECT DESCRIPTION
3.          The proposed project would strengthen: (a) the Ministry of Economy
through the provision of consultant services, computer equipment and software,
and logistical support, in its capabilities to (i) manage economic reforms;
(ii) allocate and control public resources by the design and implementation of
an integrated budget and accounting information system for financial
management, budget programming, execution and control, including institutional
strengthening of the entities that constitute the internal and external
control network; (iii) administer customs by the establishment of new
administrative procedures and related computerized information systems; (b)
the Central Government ministries and the Presidency through the provision of



- 11 -
consultant services, computer equipment and software, to carry out a
modernization of its internal administration, on the basis of new uniform
procedures and information systems for personnel, financial resources, and
facilities management; (c) the Central Bank through the provision of
consultant services, computer equipment and software, to improve organization
and procedures, develop key information systems, and enhance staff
capabilities, with special emphasis on the SEF.
4.          The Bank missions that preappraised and appraised the proposed
project visited Argentina in November 1990 and March 1991. The missions
reached agreement with the Government on the scope and main objectives of the
proposed operation and on the action plans and related budgets of the project
components presented below.
I. CUSTOMS MODERNIZATION PROGRAM
(Estimated cost of US$6.8 million)
Maior Problems and Reform Program
5.          To a great extent, the main problem of the Customs Department
(ANA) is the excessive burden of its administration on business activities and
its distortionary effects. In addition, given its relative importance in
revenue generation and effect on other revenues, the management of customs
activities has a critical impact on the fiscal balance.
6.          Economic development is also affected by ANA interventions in its
role as a regulatory institution for private operations linked to the
production cycles of industry and commerce. The direct costs under ANA
discretion play an important part in the formulation of prices in the economys
upward distortions raise costs, while undervaluations reduce them. If the
discretion is applied unevenly among importers--as is true in Argentina--
business will have artificially imposed operational conditions. In addition,
delays in the processes involved in the entry of goods bear additional costs
to importers. Finally, the tolerance of smuggling further distorts the
international trade scenario. For the above reasons: (a) the operations of
ANA should be as streamlined as possible, as well as neutral in terms of the
official determination of value; and (b) their coverage should encompass the
maximum number of transactions, i.e., contraband imports should be kept to a
minimum. Currently, ANA does not satisfy these standards of efficiency and
its operation has proved to be highly distortive.
7.          FLscal performance is affected by ANA operations:  (a) directly as
a function of its coverage of taxable transactions and/or accuracy in
valuations, and (b) indirectly, as a function of the effects of this coverage
and/or valuations on compliance with domestic taxes, in particular VAT and
income taxes. Although no attempt has been made to measure indirect effects,
they are likely to be larger than direct ones because undervaluation is
carried forward simply by being outside the formal VAT circuit.
8.          Currently, the concept of customs intervention includess
(a) control of international trade through the management of duties and taxes
Lmposed on international trade plus the prevention, control and sanctioning of
smuggling; (b) implementing international agreementsl and (c) assistance to



- 12 -
other services and departments in performing their duties, in particular the
collection of internal taxes (VAT and others). In addition, the ANA provides
statistics on international trade.
9.          The main weakness of ANA stems from the way it is conceived.  The
legal framework is very complex and provides immense decision-making
discretion to the Customs National Administrator without accountability. This
makes the system extremely vulnerable to corruption. The administrator is
mpowered to issue resolutions classifying products in accordance with special
regimes, thus creating an environment where tax liability varies according to
taxpayer but not by products. The post of Administrator traditionally has
been a political appointment. This helps to explain the very high turnover.
Under these circumstances, the balance that is achieved is at cross-purposes
with the interests of the State and there are no internal institutional forces
to support change. Discretion without accountability creates a situation in
which external monitoring becomes impossible and the Ministry of Economy
policies are held hostage to the Administrator and other ANA officials.
10.         The problem is widely acknowledged in Argentina.  Some officials
of previous governments have attempted to address it; however, the political
nature of their posts made it impossible for them to sustain occasional
attempts to remedy the situation. For example, in 1985 the Argentine
Government agreed to French technical assistance, the main product of which
would have adapted the technological and administrative setup of French
customs to Argentina. The fulfillment of this agreement was not possible
precisely for the reasons identified above. Under the PSRL, full
restructuring of ANA operations has been conceived from outside the
institution as part of a comprehensive public sector reform program. Once
completed, the reform of customs will assure establishment of an adequate
framework for ANA to perform efficiently.
I1.         The proposed PSRL incorporates support for a restructuring program
that addresses the following main weaknesses in customs operationst
(a) unjustified concentration of normative and operative functions granted to
the ANA Administrator; (b) frequent turnover of Administrators; (c) complexity
of rules and procedures with limited enforcement; (d) lack of monitoring of
AMA performance; (e) lack of efficient and effective personnel policies; and
(f) lack of a computerization program. These actions will contribute to the
transparency, equity, and efficiency of customs activities.
12.         The ANA Administrator position possesses an undue concentration of
normative and operational functions. Ideally, some of the current decision-
making functions of the Administrator should be transferred to the Ministry of
3conomy (NE), and its operational functions performed by operational divisions
within the ANA. To reverse the current concentration of functions in that
authority, a deep revision of customs regulations will be necessary. The
current legal framework is antiquated and too complex. The coexistence of
numerous rules and resolutions impedes transparency of the system, leads to
inadequate interpretations of the law, and favors overlapping procedures that
Importers use to their advantage.
13.         Customs operations in Argentina depend on the effectiveness and
lntegrity of the Administrator. Unfortunately, high turnover has inhibited
the planning of a stable program to realize medium-term objectives. Customs



- 13 -
officials throughout the country seldom provide information to the
Administrator; thus, he is usually unaware of the number, nature, and scope of
operations that take place. This is particularly true in the control area at
the borders, where there is a corps of only 50 customs officers who cannot
realistically be expected to monitor all international exchanges. It is
common practice that when ANA faces a shortage of police officers, staff from
the prefecture or the gendarmerie are called on. In practice, this leads to
confusion over responsibility and seriously compromises the integrity of
customs operations. Personnel services (health and social services) also fail
to meet the basic needs of customs staff. In addition, the current salary
structure should be completely restructured. Current salaries at all levels
are too low to attract and retain staff. Staff are also deprived of a well
planned career development program. Such deficiencies combined with
inadequate supervision cause low morale and promote a climate of corruption
and bribery. The most common forms of corruption are underinvoicing of
imports and processing exports with documents used in previous operations.
14.         The lack of an Integrated automated system for the whole
organization greatly contributes to the ineffectiveness and inefficiency of
administrative, operational, and control functions. The absence of a
mechanism for cross-checking operations has led to weak control over
operations and low detection of irregularities.
ProDosed Assistance
15.         The restructuring and modernization of ANA requires; (a) a
revision of the legal framework to simplify customs norms and procedures,
including integration of some of the decision-making responsibilities now
concentrated in the Office of the ANA Administrator in the Ministry of
Economy; (b) redesign of the organic and functional structure to establish
modern administrative processes, including redefinition of the Administrator's
operational functions and the set up of linkages between the Administrator's
office and the field offices; (c) a comprehensive computerization plan of ANA
operations, as well as of the tariff structure and the valorization function
to generate and provide reliable information and avoid fraud (the automation
plan should include an effective monitoring system to verify that computer
records match actual receipts)3 and (d) a comprehensive personnel policy that
includes a career development framework, a training program and an incentive
system linked to increases in receipts, that would be implemented when the
organizational restructuring and computerization are in place.
16.         The preparatory activities of this component are being carried out
under PSMTAL financing. The proposed PSRTAL would provide support for: (a)
preparing, monitoring and implementing an Automated Plan including a plan of
action over the next three years for the development of a computerized customs
information system within ANA to simplify and improve administrative,
operational, and control procedures. This would include systems development
and its implementation, acquisition and installation of computer equipment,
and establishment of a communications network (US$6.0 million); (b) preparing
new guidelines and procedures including legal framework, and administrative
reorganization, (US$0.3 million); (c) a training program for staff on related
new regulations, plus introductory courses on the proposed information system
(US$0.25 million); and (d) coordination of the project (US$0.25 million). The



- 14 -
total cost of activities to be financed by the Bank is estimated at
US$6.8 million.
Il. ADMINISTRATIVE REFORM AND MODERNIZATION
OF THE CENTRAL GOVERNMENT
(Estimated cost of US$5.6 million)
Maior Problems and Reform Proaram
17.         To reduce public expenditures and rehabilitate an oversized and
deteriorating public administratlve apparatus, the Argentine Government has
embarked on an Administrative Reform Program to streamline employment levels
and rationalize administrative structures and functions in the National
Government. To consolidate the Government's Reform Program, institutional
strengthening and modernization of administrative functions in the National
Government will be needed.
18.         The main objectives of the Government's reform program are the
following: (a) reduce significantly and permanently public expenditures; (b)
strengthen key areas of the Government'. administration and create an
effective administrative apparatus; (c) develop an incentive system to improve
staff productivity and build a strong work force; (d) simplify administrative
norms, deregulate key economic activities, and modernize procedures through
computerized systems. The NatLonal Government's reform program was initiated
in March 1990 (Decree 435/90) and further developed in early September
(Decrees 1757 and 1930/90) and late November of that year (Decree 2476/90).
The immediate measures taken under Decree 435/90 include:  (a) a freeze in
vacancies and promotions; (b) elimination of secretariats and reduction in the
number of subsecretariats; (c) the suspension of collective agreements; (d) a
cap on salaries) (e) elimination of overtime; (f) early retirement for those
within two years of normal retirement; and (g) enforcement of bans against
multiple employment. Under Decree 1757, two Comptroller Executive Committees
were created, one of which, CECRA (Comit6 Ejecutivo do Contralor de la Reforma
Administrativa)o is in charge of the Administrative Reform. This Committee is
composed of high-ranking officers of the Ministry of Economy, and of the
General Secretariat, the Legal and Technical Secretariat, and the Public
function Secretariat, within the Presidency. The main responsibility of this
Committee is to identify the methods and procedures for implementing the
employment reductions and restructuring of the National Government and to
ensure implementation.
19.         Decree 2476/90 establishes a specific action plan for the
implementation of the Government's Administrative Reform Program in the
National Administration (Central Government, Special Accounts, and
Decentralized Organizations). The main elements of this action plan include:
(a) rationalizing organizational structures by reducing the number of
departments (Direcciones Nacionales o Gen3rales) in each ministry and in the
Presidency; consolidation of the internal administrative functions under one
department in each ministry and each decentralized agency, as well as the
consolidation of the legal departments under one unit in each ministry;
reduction in the number of positions by at least 34% in the Central Government
and Special Accounts and at least 40% in the Decentralized Organizations, and
rationalization of administrative positions, not to exceed 33% of the total



- 15 -
personnel of the National Adminictration; (b) limitations on the recourse to
temporary (multiple) employment, which will. only be permitted for technical
and scientific activities; (c) restructuring, privatization, cancellation. or
transferring to the provinces of the Decentralized Organizations and of those
associated with Special Accounts in charge of regulating markets of regional
products, and other agencies specifically identified in the Decree; (d)
restructuring, rationalizing, and institutional strengthening of the
Ministries of Defense, Education and Justice, and of other key agen$ies such
as ANA (National Administration of Customs), the Subsecretariat of
Agriculture, the Subsecretariat of Industry and Commerce, the National
Institute of Public Administration, and scientific and technical agencies; (e)
improvement of public services; (f) privatization of selected services (i.e.,
control of personnel attendance in all agencies of the National
Administration, including maintenance and cleaning services of public
buildings)l (g) technical modernization of the public administration--
development and implementation of computerized data processing systems in all
agencies of the National Administration; (h) improving the incentive system
for key administrative positions in the National Administration through a
Program for Executive Managers, whereby 1,500 key positions will be created
with a salary structure that appropriately reflects the level of the
positions; and {i) aid to displaced workers through temporary income
maintenance, a lump-sum payment, continued payment of social benefits for up
to 18 months, training programs for possible reentry into the public sector,
and creating a special Commission on Private Enterprises to assist those
displaced workers interested in private sector employment.
20.         To date, the Government has achieved the following as part of the
Administrative Reform Program: (a) a freeze in vacancies and promotions; (b) a
reduction in the number of secretariats and subsecretariats; (c) a cap on
salaries; and (d) elimination of overtime. In addition, the program is on
track to effect reductions--62,000 as of February 1, 1991, and 120,000 by
year's end. The ministerial restructuring process is well underway.
Particularly important is the progress reached in the restructuring of the
Central Government. The new organizational structure of five of the eight
ministries (Economy, Health, Labor, Foreign Affairs and Interior) has been
approved by the National Cabinet, two (Education and Defense) are being
reviewed by CECRA, and one (Justice) is finalizing the legal process for the
establishment of its structure as a ministry. The plan for institutional
strengthening of the General Tax Office (DGI) has been approved and the
preparation of the related Decree is in process. The Program for Executive
Managers has been submitted and is in the process of being implemented. The
reconversion program for excess Government workers has been developed and the
Decree is in execution. The Government will implement the required measures
to achieve the agreed wage compression to attain a 7:1 ratio (currently about
3.5:1) from the highest to the lowest wage by late April.
21.         The administrative procedures in the eight Ministries of the
Central Government are in need of redefinition and modernization. There is a
critical lack of computerized systems to facilitate diverse administrative
operations such as personnel management (payroll, attendance, personnel
profile, contracting, etc.), financial management (budget execution and
accounting), facility management (inventory), and procurement. The lack of
computerized administrative functions renders these functions unmanageable and
inefficient. The administrative procedures in their present form involve



- 16 -
complex, cumbersome, inefficient and time-consuming administrative procedures.
Excessive bureaucratic procedures have caused increasingly unwarranted delays
in the daily operations of all ministries. There is a critical need to
establish standard guidelines to simplify and thus enhance internal
administrative procedures. The lack of coordination in the execution of
administrative functions within each ministry represents another critical
constraint. The result is duplication of work in departments, supervision of
activities, and evaluation and control; chronic delays in daily operations;
and inconsistencies on the basis of which administrative functions are
routinely conducted. To remedy these serious constraints and help
consolidate the Government's Reform Program, assistance is needed to
rationalize administrative procedures in the Ministries of the Central
Government, as well as in the Presidency. Decree 2476/90 specifically
stresses the importance of strengthening the Ministries' general
administrative operations; for this purpose, a new institutional framework has
been created for internal administration in the Central Government. This
framework is composed of Central Administrative Departments (Dizecciones
Nacionales de Administraci6n) in each Ministry and the Presidency, and
Administrative Units or Delegations in each core area of the Central
Government (i.e., Subsecretariats in the Ministries and Secretariats in the
Presidency). The proposed assistance would provide support to strengthen and
modernize the internal administrative functions, now under the coordination of
the newly created internal administration networks (Central Departments and
Delegations) in the eight key Ministries and the Presidency, with the
objective of consolidating the Government's Administrative Reform.
22.         There is a critical need to deregulate some of the functions of
the Central Government. A significant number of norms governing economic
activities such as insurance, ports, regional markets, pharmaceutical
products, and quality control for food export are found to be highly complex,
outdated, vague, and, in some cases, redundant. In addition, there Is a lack
of computerized systems for the handling of norms and regulations. These
constraints complicate the decision-making process relating to these economic
activities, which hampers daily operations and brings about unwarranted
delays. The proposed assistance would provide support to (a) rationalize and
simplify the body of norms and regulations governing selected economic
activities, and (b) design and implement a new computerized system for the
handling of streamlined norms and regulations.
23.         The Government's Reform Program includes the decentralization of
certain functions in the Central Government--transfer of public services to
the provinces. The Government is not fully equipped to undertake this effort
and would require support in: (a) analyzing the impact of the transfer of
public services to the provinces; (b) preparing the legal basis associated
with the decentralization effort; and (c) formulating guidelines for tho
actual transfer.
Proposed Assistance
24.         The Government's objectives are to: (a) strengthen the internal
administrative functions of the Central Government, specifically, in the newly
created Central Administrative Departments and their Delegations in the eight
Ministries--Health, Education, Economy, Foreign Affairs, Defense, Labor,
Justice and Interior--and in the Presidency; (b) rationalize and simplify



- 17 -
norms and regulations governing selected economic activities;and (c) ensure
adequate transition of public services to the provinces.
25.         The proposed assistance would provide support for:  (a) the design
of simplified standard internal administrative procedures and preparation of
guidelines for their implementation (US$0.25 million); (b) development,
adaptation and establishment of computer systems for personnel management
(payroll, attendance, personnel profile, contracting, etc.), financial
management (budget execution and accounting), and facility management
(inventories); and procurement in the internal administration networks of the
eight Ministries and the Presidency (US$0.75 million); (c) acquisition and
installation of hardware (US$1.9 million); (d) training in basic management
operations and procedures and related systems (US$0.2 million); (e) the review
of existing norms and regulations governing selected economic activities
(i.e., insurance, ports, regional markets, pharmaceutical products and quality
control of food export), and formulation of recommendations for
rationalization and simplification (US$1.4 million); (f) design and
implementation of a computerized system for the handling of streamlined norms
and regulations (US$0.2 million); (h) the analysis of tne impact of the
transfer of public services to the provinces, preparation of the legal basis
associated with the decentralization effort, and formulatlon of guidelines for
the transfer (US$0.8 million); and (i) coordination and technical management
of the component (US$0.1 million). The total cost of activities to be
financed by the Bank is estimated at US$5.6 million.
26.         The expected results of the activities proposed would be:
(a) formulation and application of guidelines to simplify and thus enhance
internal administrative procedures and to strengthen coordination in the
execution of administrative functions within each ministry; (b) installation
of computer systems to facilitate diverse administrative operations (personnel
management, financial management, facility management and procurement); (c)
trained technical personnel who would be proficient in performing
administrative functions; (d) formulation of a general normative Decree on
deregulation; (e) streamlined norms and regulations governing selected
economic activities that will favor development ol markets and efficiency
gains; (f) installation of computer systems for the handling of norms,
including trained technical personnel in the usage of the normative
information system; (g) legal basis associated with the decentralization of
public services; and (i) guidelines for the preparation and transfer of public
services to the provinces and municipalities. The proposed assistance would
consolidate the Government's Administrative Reform Program through
institutional strengthening and modernization of the Central Government.
III. PUBLIC SECTOR COMPREHENSIVE FINANCIAL MANAGEMENT
AND PERFORMANCE CONTROL
(Estimated cost of US$5.1 million)
Major Constraints in Budaetarv Capacity and Public Sector Financial
Manaaement and Reform Prooram
27.         The legal and institutional framework for financial management,
budget programming,and control does not ensure an efficient and comprehensive
management of public sector resources. The weakness of budgetary capacity



- 18 -
results in an inability to allocate adequate resources and control spending.
The budgetary process is plagued by several problems, including:
(a) insufficient coverage of the various public sector segments; (b) absence
of budget programming and therefore of a regular programmatic review of public
expenditures; (c) inaccurate registries and absence of timely budget data, and
therefore inadequate monitoring of budget execution due to lack of accounting
norms, institutional weakness of the public sector financial authority, and
unenforceable reporting requirements; (d) ex-ante and ineffectual control;
Ce) the breakdown of the public investment planning process and the absence of
a link to the budget; and (f) the lack of computerized information systems to
support financial management, programming, execution and evaluation of the
budget, as well as control.
28.         The Government recognizes the need for both legal and
institutional change to regain control over Argentina's public expenditures.
The National Public Sector requires a legal framework for modern financial
management, including budget and control of expenditures. Accordingly, the
Government with Bank assistance has prepared a draft Law on Financial
Management and Performance Control that would:
(a)   Implement a comprehensive financial management framework for the
National Public Sector, allowing differentiated treatment of the
various segments or components (Central Government, Decentralized
Organizations, Special Accounts, public enterprises, and social
security funds), but guaranteeing an integrated budgetary process;
(b)   Define financial and budgetary authority and assign the
responsibility to the Subsecretary of Finance, Ministry of
Economy, to carry out a comprehensive financial management and an
integrated budgetary process. In addition, would define specific
responsibilities for each key financial management function and
agency (Contaduria General de la Naci6n (CG), Direccidn Nacional
de Programacion Presupuestaria (DNPP), the new office for Debt
Management and the Treasury), as well as for all National Public
Sector entities and executing units (including budget programming,
execution, monitoring and evaluation, as well as reporting
requirements);
(c)   Establish a modern institutional structure for control by:
(i) assigning full accounting responsibilities to the CG
(coordination of the new financial and accounting information
systems, accounting norms, and the preparation of the national
financial accounts); (ii) creating a system for internal control
by transforming the existing SIGEP into a general comptroller of
the Executive (Sindicatura General de la Naci6n-SIGENAC) reporting
directly to the President, and establishing a network of internal
auditing units reporting to the heads of the various government
entities and operating on the basis of auditing norms defined by
SIGENAC and under its supervision; and (iii) restructuring the
Tribunal de Cuentas de la Nacion (TCN) into a new Contraloria
General de la Nacion (CG), an agency for external control, with
full administrative and financial independence. While the
internal control function will support executive managers through
monitoring and audits, the external control function will



- 19 -
essentially be focused on ex-post performance control exempt from
pre-control and performance judgement practices, reporting
directly to Congress, concerning (i) audits performed directly-or
through qualified audit firms, and (ii) the information produced
by the internal control structure; and
(d)   Define the basic principles under which the Executive could make
use of foreign and internal credit and would limit the changes in
the level of indebtedness to the amounts incoroorated in the
budget.
29.         The Government has also undertaken an action program to modernize
its financial management and effectively reconstruct the budget process.
First, it has established a task force to design and implement the new basis
for budget programming, execution, monitoring and evaluation. The advance
preparation of the 1991 budget (sent to Congress in February 1991)
incorporates: (a) an efficient procedure to cope with inflation; (b) a
programmatic review of expenditures taking into account the administrative
reform program and the new policies defined for the public sector;
(c) measures to strengthen public investment planning through approved
analysis and project selection in the budget process; and (d) recommendations
to improve resource allocation in the budget through a better definition of
the nature of expenditures and the associated budget program structure. There
are also ongoing efforts to improve existing information systems in the
Accounting Office, the Treasury, and the Budget Office. These efforts would
be continued to facilitate a completely new and comprehensive basis for budget
preparation, execution, and control beginning in 1992.
30.         Second, the Government, through Decree 2476/90 (November 26, 1990)
on Rationalization of the National Public Administration, has established the
criteria that will guide implementation of a program to reduce the scope and
coverage of earmarked special funds. Previously, Decree 1757 had extended the
power of the Subsecretary of Finance to reassign up to 100 percent of the
funds originating in the accounts. It is expected that the Government will
make progress in the implementation of this program by reducing the coverage
of earmarked funds, incorporating revenues into general revenues, and reducing
functions and expenditures. This will be undertaken in conjunction with the
administrative reforms to eliminate unessential funds and agencies. The full
implementation of the rationalization/elimination program will take place in
about a year and be consistent with a thorough programmatic review of the
budget relative to administrative reform targets.
31.         Finally, to improve transparency and institutionalize further
transactions with the nonfederal public sector (public enterprises and
provinces), the Government intends to limit amounts transferred to these
entities to the amounts approved in the 1991 budget. For the provinces this
would entail supporting transfers only through the Coparticipation Law and
designated special funds. For the public enterprises, explicit but declining
subsidies would be given to the railways as well as a specified level of
transfers from the national oil company (YPW). These budgetary commitments
would complement reforms already underway and supported by the PERAL.



- 20 -
Proposed Assistance
32.         A completely new basis for budget programming, execution and
control would be established to facilitate a comprehensive public sector
financial management framework. To achieve this, the Subsecretary of Finance
has prepared a draft decree to develop an Integrated Budget and Accounting
System for the National Administration. The objectives of the proposed
Integratad Budget and Accounting System (Sistema Integrado de Presupuesto y
Contabilidad - SIPRECO) are: (a) rationalization of budgetary and accounting
procedures; (b) generation of updated and complete public sector financial
information; (c) creation through computerization of consistent and autonomous
financial management in all the entities involved; and (d) incorporation of
modern technologies for efficient administration of public res'urces. The
SIPRECO would include various systems specifically for the Budget Office
(DNPP), the Accounting Office (CG), and the Treasury, as well as systems that
would interrelate them with those for debt management, revenues, and payments.
In addition, the SIPRECO structure would be extended to the internal
administration networks throughout the National Administration.
33.         The Bank, under the Public Sector Management Technical Assistance
Project, has financed: (a) the preparation of a draft of the new Financial
Management and Performance Control Law; (b) a study (being prepared by ECLAC)
to evaluate the existing budgetary process and produce recommendations to
improve budget programming; (c) consultants to improve existing information
systems in CG and the Treasury; and (d) the design of a new accounting system.
34.         The Bank will finance the following activities of this component:
(a) design of the new criteria and establishment of new methods to improve
budget programming and public sector financial management, and more widespread
implementation to ensure efficient resource allocation. This implies the
continuation of activities initiated by ECLAC that now emphasize the
implementation of new methods and techniques (USS0.3 million); (b) preparation
of manuals on the new guidelines (including draft decrees), methods and
procedures (to be applied in budget preparation and execution, accounting, and
internal and external control), as well as related policy guidelines that will
be needed as a result of approval of the draft Law on Financial management and
Performance Control (US$0.65 million); (c) development and establishment of ar.
integrated financial management information system (SIPRECO). This would
include computer hardware and systems development (US$3.15 million); (d)
training and professional enhancement program for officers of key financial
agencies (the Accounting Office, *he Treasury, the Debt Management Office, and
the National Department for Budget Programming), the institutional structure
for control and those of the internal administration network responsible for
the newly integrated financial management and control systems and procedures
(USSO.9 million); and (e) coordination and technical management of the
component (US$0.1 million). The total estimated cost of activities to be
financed by the Bank is US$5.1 million.
35.         The main outputs/impacts of the proposed assistance will be:
(a) implementation of SIPRECO and therefore availability of the required
information for efficient budget execution and control; (b) a new
methodological and administrative basis for public sector financial management
and budget programming, and therefore improved resource allocation in the
budget process; and (c) strengthening of the OG, DNPP, the Debt Management



- 21 -
Office, and the Treasury, the institutions .n charge of the structure for
control, and the internal administration networks of the Central Government to
perform adequately in the reformed financial management and control
environment.
IV. REORGANIZATION AND MODERNIZATION GF THE CENTRA BANK
(Estimated cost of US$3.28 million)
Maior Problems and the Reorganization of the Central Bank
36.         Since the present Government took office in mid-1989, it has
recognized the need to change the Central Bank's organizational structure. At
the request of the Government of Argentina, a Bank Financial Sector Mission
was undertaken in October-November of 1989 with the objective of making
recommendations in this area. The mission, with the assistance of the US
Federal Reserve, identified many problems in the Central Bank's organizational
structure. It made several recommendations, the principal one being that the
Central Bank's core areas be separated into operations and analytical areas,
rather than, as at present, into external and domestic areas, each of which
embrace operations and analytical activities. The spreading of functions
among many and diverse management units has slowed decision-making and
information processing.
37.         The Central Bank's Directors approved a reorganization of the
Superintendency of Financial Entities in July 1990, and carried it out in
September 1990. The general Central Bank plan for reorganization has been
recently approved by its Board of Directors, and the reorganization process is
already underway. The new structure is essentially consistent with the World
Bank's recommendations. The Central Bank has also prepared a draft decree
that would establish its financial autarchy; the proposed decree is being
reviewed by the Presidency and is expected to be approved in the next few
weeks. Finally, it is also expected that the Executive will send to Congross
a proposal for the new Central Bank's Charter that is consistent with the
objectives of the economic reform and incorporates the implications of the
recently approved legislation guaranteeing full convertibility of the austral.
38.         The reorganization plan would reduce the 23 departments to 18.
There would be two basic areas as before, each headed by a Sub-General Manager
(Subgerente General); however, they would be designated a Policy Area and an
Operations Area. Central Bank divisions were organized by subject matter,
e.g., the Financial System Studies and Financing Division compiled statistics
and managed the financing operations. The reorganization would permit a more
precise delineation of operations unit activities. The Central Bank's
accounting system would be reconstituted to reflect this change. In effect,
only operations units would be able to handle accounts, with each operations
unit only able to affect a defined range of accounts.
39.         Under the new organization, the main functions of the Policy Area
comprise: (a) economic, monetary, and banking studies; (b) statistics; (c)
monetary and exchange norms; (d) monetary policyl and (e) external sector.
The Operations Area includes: (a) open-market operations; (b) credit
operations; (c) accounting; and (d) treasury. In addition, there are
operations areas to handle Liquidations of Financial Entities, the



- 22 -
Superintendency of Financial Entities, and the support areas of Administration
and Legal.
40.         The reorganization is likely to encounter some practical
obstacles. The most important is that at present a very small number of
relatively high-ranking staff cperformarry out a large number of crucial
activities. The proposed reorganization would divide these activities between
two or more departments. Appropriately skilled and trained staff may not now
be available to carry out all of the functions as described in the
reorganization. This is part of the problem the reorganization aims to solve.
In following up the reorganization, skills would be disseminated more widely
within the BCRA.
41.         The Central Bank has a severe deficiency in its computing
equipment. It has taken some steps to remedy this deficiency--some computing
equipment has recently been acquired under the Public Sector Management
Technical Assistance Loan (PSMTAL)--but lack of resources has prevented it
from completely solving this problem. The problem may be broadly
characterized as follows. First, in the areas concerned with information-
gathering, data-processing and analysis, there is an acute lack of computing
equipment. The Central Bank's capacity to maintain and process information
for its own use is accordingly limited. Policy-making is hamstrung by the
inability of analysts to simulate even the simplest models of the economy.
This major flaw contributes to the difficulties of undertaking routine daily
activities such as monetary programming, balance of payments programming, and
analysis of financial institutions. A related problem is that access to
information within the Central Bank has become increasingly inefficient.
Second, lack of up-to-date equipment has served as an obstacle to the
modernization of the Central Bank's operational capacity. Information about
transactions is transmitted to the Central Bank's accounting system slowly and
is poorly organized. As a consequence, Central Bank management is often
uncertain about the state of the Bank's policy instruments. The procedures by
which information is transmitted to the accounting department are extremely
deficient, and will require major changes. A particular problem is the
transfer of data between the Superintendency of Financial Entities and the
main part of the Central Bank, which are located eight city blocks apart. The
Central Bank's mainframe computer, which is almost a decade old, is both
obsolete and operating dangerously close to its capacity limit.
Proposed Assistance
42.         The Government's overall objective is to restore the Central
Bank's effectiveness so it can meet its primary objective of ensuring the
external and domestic stability of the austral. To this end, the Government
intends to provide the Central Bank functional independence by promulgating a
new Charter, recapitalizing it, and providing it with the requisite technical
capacity. Activities under the PSRTAL would help strengthen the Central
Bank's technical capacity.
43.         The proposed assistance would provide support fort  (a) staff
training in areas of Central Bank functions including monetary programming,
macroeconomics, financial analysis, and banking (US$0.2 million); (b) external
training for Central Bank staff in open market operations and in international
reserve portfolio (US$0.1 million); (c) training of Bank staff in debt



- 23 -
reporting and management (US$0.08 million); (d) strengthening the management
of data bases and information services, including large debtors, disqualified
checking account holdere, and bank data (US$O.1 million); (e) designing a.
Procedures Manual in conjunction with the planned reorganization (US$0.2
million); and (f) design and implementation of an Automation Plan including
systems development, hardware, and training of Central Bank staff in the new
systems (US$2.5 million); and (g) coordination and technical management of the
component (US$0.1 million). The total cost of activities to be financed by
the Bank is US$3.28 million.
44.         The Central Bank is presently preparing an Automation Plan that
includes a plan of action over the next three years for mainframe
installation, acquisition of personal computers, development of an internal
network, and external linkages (including linkage to the Superintendency of
Financial r-itities). This plan would also include provisions for training in
computer systems for Central Bank staff. An internal committee has been set
up within the Central Bank to plan training programs in various areas in which
Central Bank staff require greater competence (apart from computer skills).
Outside training at the IMF is being considered for Central Bank staff. The
Central Bank will need to set up a committee to begin planning a procedures
manual in conjunction with the reorganization now being implemented and the
Automation Plan. The Central Bank will also need to seek consulting
assistance for its data base management. For training in operations, the
assistance of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York (FRSNY) and the Center for
Latin American Monetary Studies (CEMLA) is being considered. Finally, World
Bank assistance in debt reporting and management is presently under
consideration.
45.         The expected result of the activities proposed would be:  (a)
establishment of computer systems and equipment; (b) successfully completed
course work by staff indicating proficiency in use of the new systemsl
(c) completed course work by staff indicating proficiency in central banking
skills; (d) a useful procedures manual; (e) effectively organized data bases;
and (f) effective and skilled operations staff are to disseminate acquired
knowledge among other staff. The Central Bank would improve its operation,
which would thus permit the authorities to stabilize the macroeconomy more
effectively.
V. REORGANIZATION AND MODERNIZATION OF THE SUPERINTENDENCY
OF FINANCIAL ENTITIES (SEP)
(Estimated cost of US$1.62 million)
Naior Problems and Recent Reorcanization of SSF
46.         The SEF's practices regarding loan classification, provisioning,
and interest, are both lenient and inconsistently applied. Various norms
regarding accounting, liquidity and solvency, control systems, credit
evaluation, liability regulation, and monetary regulation, have over the years
become overly complicated and increasingly ineffective. The internal
organization of the SEF is inefficient, partly because responsibilities were
not clearly delimited, but also because coordination was ineffective. In
particular, the SEF separated staff who analyzed bank reports from those who
inspected banks. Inspection procedures currently emphasize financial
institutions' compliance with reserve requirements, but inadequately assess



- 24 -
solvency and profitability. There is also a human resources problem: many
staff lack the necessary skill to evaluate Argentina's financial institutions.
The SEP's information systems have a number of deficiencies. Moreover, the
8E lacks the data processing capacity to manage the large quantity of
information it must process to supervise adequately Argentina's financial
system. In fact, financial institutions are required to provide far more data
than the SEF can absorb.
47.         Although a large percentage of bank loan portfolios are weak, with
a concomitant problem of improper asset classification, the negative
consequences to the banks under present circumstances are limited since
Argentine banks generally have a high ratio of capital to assets. Even under
present circumstances, however, an effective SEP would be helpful for two
reasons; (a) it would help verify the low (in many cases uegative) profit
flows banks are now earning, and (b) it would help the authorities to oversee
better the process of consolidation that will be essential for Argentine
banking institutions to become effective and efficient. In any case, once the
Argentine financial system returns to active lending, the SEF will have to be
prepared to carry out ar. adequate supervisory role. This is the objective of
the reforms to be supported by the PSRL and the PSRTAL with respect to the
SEP.
48.         In September 1990, the Central Bank undertook a fundamental
reorganization of the SEF. The new organizational structure, by itself, does
not make the SEP more effective; however, it should provide a framework within
which progress can more easily take place. The most important effect of the
reorganization is to end the separation between the analysis and inspection
functions. In addition, the reorganization creates a more streamlined and
adaptable structure. One reporting level has been eliminated at the core of
SEP's control (compilation, monitoring, and analysis of data) and inspection
functions. More importantly, the basic inspection units would be reorganized
to permit flexibility: the management of the SEF can thus constitute its
supervision teams as necessary to accommodate the evolving state of the
financial system. Finally, several units previously outside the SEF but more
appropriately part of the superintendency functions were integrated within it-
-in particular the "norms" unit and the units that evaluate financial
entities, which includes the system that monitors "large debtors."
49.         The new SEF is structured as follows.  The institution is headed
(as before) by a Superintendent, one of the highest ranking staff in the
Central Bank, Sub-General Manager (the position of General Manager is
currently vacant and may be eliminated by the new Charter). There are three
divisions (gerencias), each headed by a manager and comprising several
departments: Supervision, Financial Entities, and Technical. In addition,
there are two separate Departments dealing with administration of the SEF and
control of foreign exchange operations that report directly to the
Superintendent. Under the previous structure, there were four divisions:
Control; Inspections; Authorizations for New Entities; Branches and Agencies;
and Maintenance of Norms. The control and inspection functions have been
separately maintained, wit.n virtually no interaction between analysts and
inspectors.
SO.         The authorities Intend to bring the SEF "up to speed" to support
the process of financial revitalization they hope to bring about in the medium



- 25 -
torm. In the short term, the SEF will deal with the deteriorating situation
in many banks owned by provincial governments. The basic strategy is to
improve the computer capacity of SEP centers by not only training staff for
computerization but simultaneously improving staff skills in SEP procedures.
As a result of reorganizing and computerization, the authorities hope the SEP
wills better process information it receives from financial institutions, and
provide the results of its analysis more effectively and rapidly to decision-
makers. At the same time, the SEP should take advantage of the computer
training it will have to provide, to focus on more up-to-date analyais and
inspection techniques.
51.         The Bank would provide financial and technical support for the
computerization of SEF and subsequent training under the proposed PSRTAL.
Funds from the existing PSMTAL already are being applied in an initial phase
of the computerization program. These funds should enable the SEF to obtain
personal computers for use in implementing pilot procedures that will serve as
the planning basis for future computer operations.
Pronosed Assistance
52.         The PSRTAL would provide support for:  (a) staff training in the
areas of Superintendency functions such as inspection procedures, financial
analysis, banking practices, and economic analysis (US$0.2 million); (b)
revising and updating the various existing norms (US$0.1 million); and (C)
design and implementation of an Automation Plan, including systems
development, computer equipment, and training SEF staff in the new systems
(USS1.24 million); and (d) coordination and technical management of the
component (US$0.08 million). The total cost of activities to be financed by
the Bank is US$1.62 million.
53.         The SEP is preparing an Automation Plan, including a plan of
action over the next three years for installation of its central computer,
acquisition of personal computers, the internal network, and external
linkages, including linkage to the Central Bank main host. The plan would
specify the program for training in computer systems necessary for SEP staff.
The SEF would also establish a training program in areas in which SEF staff
require greater competence other than computers. The SEP also would establish
a program for review of the existing norms. Lastly, it would determine
consultancy needs for database management.
54.         The expected results of the activities proposed would be: (a)
systems in place and installation of main computing equipment and network; (b)
completed course work by staff indicating proficiency in the use of the
equipment; (c) completed course work by staff indicating proficiency in
supervision skills; (d) revised norms, along with procedures in place for
ongoing review of norms; (e) effectively organized databases; (f) properly
inspected provincial banks; and (g) effective and well-skilled staff with
skills well disseminated among its members.  The expected outcome/impact is
that the SEF would operate more efficiently, which would permit the
authorities more easily to detect problems in banks and enable them to act
more quickly to cortrol these problems.

VI. IMPLEMENTATION UNIT FOR THE PSRTAL
(Estimated cost US$0.6 million)
55.         The Project Implementation Unit (PIU) will support the Ministry of
Economy in the management of the Project, as well as in the coordination and
follow-up of activities under the five project components to ensure successful
implementation of the Public Sector Reform Technical Assistance Project.
56.         The PIU will include a Project Coordinator, who will act as Deputy
National Director, and two executive-level professionals (one Computer Expert
and one Management Assistant) --all of whom will report to the National
Director of the Project. To facilitate the administration and related
procurement needed by the Project, the Government will sign a Management
Service Agreement with UNDP-OPS or other suitable management arrangement
acceptable to the Government and the Bank.
C. PROJECT ADMINISTRATION AND IMPLEMENTATION
organization and Implementation
57.         The Borrower will be the Republic of Argentina.  The Ministry of
Economy (ME) will be the Executing Agency. The National Director who will be
appointed by the Minister at least at the level of Subsecretary will head the
PIU and be responsible for overall project implementation. A full-time Deputy
Director will be assigned to the Subsecretary with powers to hire consultants
and request disbursements from the Bank. The functions of the PIU would be
to: (a) manage Bank financing with the support of UNDP-OPS; (b) keep close
contact with the Counterpart Institutions and the Coordinators of the five
components and provide technical support as required; and (c) monitor
compliance with the Bank's legal agreement. In carrying out the proposed
project, the National Director would facilitate the implementation of specific
project components with: (a) the Customs Department for its modernization
program} (b) the Administrative Departments of the Ministries and the
Presidency for the development of new integrated administrative systems and
procedures; (c) the Subsecretary of Finance for development of the new basis
for comprehensive financial management and control; and (d) the Central Bank
and the Superintendency of Financial Entities for the needed support in their
reorganization and modernization efforts.
Procurement
58.         The goods and services to be financed under the project,
summarized in Schedule A, would be procured in accordance with Bank Guidelines
for procurement. Contracts for the procurement of equipment, supplies, and
maintenance items equivalent to US$250,000 or more would be awarded through
ICB; items between US$25,000 and US$250,000 with an aggregate amount not to
exceed US$500,000 would be made through LCB. No contract for the procurement
of equipment is expected below US$25,000; if this case occurs, contracts
valued below US$25,000 up to an aggregate amount of US$100,000 would be
awarded through local or international shopping by requesting quotations from
at least three eligible suppliers. Local manufacturers will be granted a
preference margin according to Bank Guidelines in all contracts for goods
awarded under rCs procedures. The Government's LCB procedures have been
reviewed by the Bank and found acceptable. Consultants for technical



- 27 -
assistance and training services under the project would be selected in
accordance with Bank Guidelines and under terms of reference and employment
conditions satisfactory to the Bank. It is expected that most contracts will
be awarded to consulting firms for more effective project management.
59.         All ICB contracts and the first two LCB contracts for goods will
be subject to prior review by the Bank. All other contracts would be subject
to ex-pogt review by the Bank. In addition, whenever possible, procurement
will be made on the basis of packages of US$250,000 or more.
60.         To facilitate the procurement of equipment and the hiring of
individual consultants, the Borrower has proposed to the Bank to employ UNDP-
OP8. Previous experiences with UNDP-OPS in supporting the management of
Bank's projects in Argentina are good; they have an office in Buenos Aires
with broad experience in handlLng this type of project. In addition, given
that the PSRTAL would finance to a large extent a relatively limited number of
main contracts for goods and consultant services, it is expected that their
administrative commission will be significantly lower than the one applied to
former Bank projects in Argentina. Finally, the respective Management Service
Agreement would specify that UNDP-OPS would follow Bank guidelines for
procurement of goods and contracting of consultant services.
Disbursements and Financing
61.         Disbursements would be made on the basis of Statements of
Expenditures (SOEs) for contracts valued below US$250,000. For every contract
e-ual to or above this amount, disbursements would be fully documented. For
disbursements made through SOEs, detailed documentation providing evidence of
expenditures would be retained by the PIU at ME and/or UNDP-OPS Office in
Buenos Aires, and made available for the required audit and also for
supervision by the Bank. A special account will not be established in this
case because of the service agreement being considered with UNDP-OPS.
62.         The Government's contribution of approximately US$8.5 million
equivalent would essentially consist of counterpart staff, administrative and
computer equipment, office space, supplies, secretarial services, and vehicle
operation to be provided in the different project components.
Accounts and Audits
63.         Separate accounts would be kept for all expenditures made under
the project. The PIU at ME and/or the UNDP-OPS Office in Buenos Aires would
maintain records and accounts for all project activities. The accounts and
SOBs would be audited each year by auditors acceptable to the Bank in
accordance with the Bank's Auditing Guidelines. The audit reports would be
submitted to the Bank not later than six months after the close of each
project fiscal year.

GENERAL DESCRIPTION OF THE COMPUTER SYSTEMS
FOR MODERNIZATION OF CUSTOMS
1.          The System would provide a comprehensive computerization of
all customs operatLons. It would result in simplified and more
expeditious procedures at a time when overall effectiveness and
efficiency of this key agency is being increased.
2.          The specific computer systems would be the basis for a
complete automation of customs management--involving detailed data bases
on tariff structure and other foreign trade policies; the registration
of manifests on the basis of which foreign trade operations take place;
the registration of data on actual exports and imports; and the
associated data for fiscal inspection and statistical purposes. The
nucleus of the system would be developed under a standardized software
environment (UNIX).
3.          Currently, there are 54 customs offices in Argentina.  The
System would be implemented in three stages involving: (a) the three
major customs offices (Ezeiza first as a model office, the Buenos Aires
Port and Aeroparque, together representing 80% of the customs
operations); (b) a group of six or seven offices that cover 95% of the
customs operations; and (c) the rest of the customs offices.
4.          The establishment of the System would require different
types of computer equipment, based on the importance of the customs
office: (a) the largest offices would require superminis/mainframes
with their own set of workstations; (b) local networks with servers
would mainly be used for customs offices supplied in the second stage,
with size capacity varying, according to the vclume of transactions
managed by each office; and (c) personal computers for the rest of the
offices.
5.          In addition, computer equipment facilities in the various
offices would be linked to the main computer center at the National
Customs Administration. These linkages would be established through a
communications network using existing infrastructure; for locations that
have no access to an existing communications network, direct lines or
regular telephone lines would be used.
6.          In order to work in a distributed envir6nment, it would be
necessary to define a distributed management of functions. Currently,
some of the import and export functions are supported in a centralized
implementation.  The installation of two compu;ere, with capacity for
200 workstations in a radius of 20 km (Ezeiza, the Buenos Aires Port and
Aeroparque), would cover the estimated needs.
7.          Both sets of equipment would back up each other and could
act as main nodeg of-the network. Data base duplication at both sites
would contribute to the security of the entire system.

8.          In the intermediate offices, the orimary nodes, procedures and
data would be distributed and daily communication would be established to send
control parameters and software updates.
9.          The amount and type of operations dealt with in the rest of the
offices, secondary nodes, would determine the scope of distribution. In
principle, these customs would capture and validate data and would process it
in the primary node that corresponds to its area of influence.

GENERAL DESCRIPTION OF THE COMPUTER SYSTEM4S FOR THE MODERNIZATION oF
iNTERNAL ADiINISTRATION -o  THE CENTRA  GOCVERNMENT
1.    The planned new systems for modernization of internal administration of the
Central Government would provide adequate tools for effective and efficient
management of personnel, financial resources, facilities and procurement. The
plan covers all the institutions comprising the Central Governmetit (eight
Ministries and the Presidency), for which it is possible and desirable to
establish standard administrative procedures and management information systems.
2.   The systems to be developed would be based on the new administrative
procedures and guidelines that would be developed within the scope of this
project. These systems would provide integrated solutions for the management of
personnel, financial resources, facilities and procurement.  In these three
cases, software design and implementation should be common to all agencies, even
though some minor differences may be introduced given the special needs of some
of the Ministries and the Presidency. The systems development would benefit from
similar existing systems that have been developed for the same purposes in other
countries.
3.    In terms of hardware, the establishment of the systems recognize three
different levels: (a) powerful minicomputers or supermicros for the National
Departments of Administration of the eight Ministries and the Presidencyl (b)
local networks for the twenty main administrative delegations; and (c) personal
computers with printers  for the  smaller  administrative  units.    Another
minicomputer would be required for the Normative System. Its 4 or 5 work.2ations
would  ,e installed in the Direction of Parliamentary Information.  Standard
information for its consolidation would be provided by the computers of each main
component of the Central Government (i.e. by the Secretariat of Public Function).
4.    The computer. equipment configuration and the software design should be
undertaken consistently with the automation plan of the SIPREOO project. The
systems to be installed in the Budget Office (DNPP), in the Accounting Office
(CG) and in the Treasury would have as inputs the outputs of the System of the
Administrative Directions and Services.
5.    In spite actual network linkages are not indispensable because consolidated
information would not generally be used on-line, some communication among the
National Departments of Administration of each Ministry and its dependant
services should be recommended for mailing and data transmission. Direct links
with the mainframes to be installed in the DNPP, CG and the Treasury should be
planned according to the patterns and protocols to be defined by the SIPRECO
Automation Plan.

GENERAL DESCRrPTION OF THE COMPUTER SYSTEMS FOR PUBLIC
SECTOR FINANCIAL MANAGEMENT. BUDGET AND ACCOUNTING
1.          The Integrated Information System for Public Sector Financial
Management, Budget and Accounting (SIPRECO) would provide the fundamental
tools for a comprehensive financial management of the public sector and would
increase the efficiency of budgetary and accounting procedures. SIPRECO
comprlses the computerized systems for budget programming (revenues and
expenditures) and execution, accounting and treasury functions.
2.          Computer equipment would be required for the Budget Office (DNPP),
the Accounting Office (CG), the Treasury and linkages to the administrative
services of the National Pub,lic Administration. Mainframes linked to internal
networks would be required in DNPP, CG, and the Treasury. The systems to be
operated in the administrative offices will be harmonized with those of DNPP,
CG, and the Treasury. Accordingly, their local networks should have the
capacity to interact with the mainframe systems through direct linkages or
indirect transfers of information.
3.          The detailed automation plan is now being prepared; however, the
estimated maximum total cost of the central nucleus of SIPRECO would be
US$4.65 million, US$1.75 million for software and US$2.9 million for hardware.

GENERM. tflSCR!PTION O? THE COMZUTE  §YSTES aTm=
FM, TRE CEN=   BB&
1.    The planned computer systems network (csN) would provide daily support to
the main functions of the Central Banks interoperability with the
Superintendendency of Financial Entities (SEP) and the telecommunication with the
financial entities.   The main functions involves   (i) credit and monetary
operations; (il.) Soreign exchange operationsI and (iii) foreign debt operations.
In addition, it will support the activities of the Policy Studies Area that
involves  (i) economic and financial analysis; (ii) statistics; (iii) policy
formulation; and (iv) international relations.
2.    The design of the computer systems, to be developed and implemented, should
therefore answer to the requirements of operational and analytical functions and
those decisions taken at political and managerial levels. The systems that would
support management of credit an(. monetary, foreign exchange and foreign debt
operations should be highly user oriented (for the staff in charge of those
operations) and provide on-line access. The development of applications should
be based on a data base management system and fourth generation tools in order
to let the operations distribution, statistical analysis, simulations and
projections, as well as the access to information from different work positions.
The DBMS has the mechanisms required to ensure security and reliability of BCRA
data.    This methodology would  allow the  areas  with  analysis  functions
responsibility to select data and process it locally. The administrative areas
would be able to process transaction in the local network and update the Data
Base with summary information.
3.    Data base management systems would bc required for various levels: the
mainframe, local networks and personal computers (PCs). In addition, specific
software systems for monetary and banking analysis, monetary programming, public
sector accounts, and balance of payments and foreign exchange forecasting would
be established.
4.    In terms of hardware, the new systems demand the configuration of a
mainframe that would act as a back up of the BCRA host and local networks linked
to it. In this computer equipment, administrative systems would run-i ncluding
personnel, financial and facilities management. External connections would be
established to allow access to the most important data banks on financial and
foreign trade information worldwide (involving Geneva, New York, Paris and
Brussels), as well as transfers of information to and from the financial
entities. The mainframe would be connected to the SEF server.
5.    Two local networks are required for operational divisions and three for the
technical and administrative areas.   It is estimated that an average of 10
workstations will be needed in each local network.   The minimum desired
configuration of workstation is that of a regular AT.

GENERAL DESCRZPTION OF THE COMPUTER SYSTEMS NETWORK
ER THE SUPERINTENDENCY 0E. FIANCIAL ENTITXES
1.    The planned Computer Systems Network (CSN) for the Superintendency of
Financial Entities (SEF) would provide permanent support for the basic functions
of: (i) inspection and supervision of banks; and (1i) financial and economic
analysis of banks and banking practices.
2.    SEP is in charge of the follow-up, inspection, and supervision of the
banking sector both private and public. Each of these banks provides periodic,
detailed reports on the status of their operations, which must be evaluated by
SEF. The banking sector generates a large amount of information that has to be
accurately classified and processed.
3.    Similar to the proposed computerization plan for the Central Bank, the
Superintendency requires the configuration of a main computer linked to the BCRA
and to local networks installed in the areas of inspection and supervision, as
well as in its technical area in charge of analysis. Local networks could be
configured not only by functions but also by groups of banks.  Total local
networks required involve two for the three main divisions (Supervision.
Financial Entities, and Technical) and one more for administrative systems and
control of foreign exchange operations (departments that report directly to the
Superintendent) and legal operations. A total of 100 workstations distributed
among the 10 positions of each local network and 70 personal computers attached
to the network would satisfy the needs of the SEF.
4.    Given the availability of software for financial and economic analysis of
banks, the workstations in the network would combine this software with IBN-
compatible technology.   The systems to be developed would use data base
manageent systems and 4th generation tools in a portable environment and would
be faced accordingly with the BCRA developments.
5.    The mainframe would support the internal network and main storage data
bases as well as facilitate overall consolidated analysis of the banking sector.
The mainframe would be connected to the Central Bank host.

ARGENTINA
PUBLIC SECTOR REFORM LOAN (PSRL):  EXECUTIVS SUMMARY
1.          Macroeconomic Context.  After two decades of economic
deterioration, culminating in hyperinflation at the end of 1989 and in early
1990, the Government has steadily enacted structural reforms to reduce the
underlying cause of macroeconomic instability--the fiscal deficit. A first
phase of reforms centered on the public enterprises and provincial finances,
but also included the beginnings of improvements in the tax system and the
elimination of the quasi-fiscal deficit. During this phase, macroeconomic
management has sought to control expenditures and raise revenues through
temporary measures that by their nature could not be enduring. The current
program is based on tight fiscal and monetary policies and a fixed, fully
backed exchange rate; inflation has fallen from more than 30 percent monthly
to less than 4 percent in mid-1991. However, public finances remain weak, and
because of the history of hyperinflation and small monetary base, the economic
situation is fragile. While the temporary measures to control the deficit
remain in place, the Government has moved to a second phase of structural
reforms to make the fiscal balance sustainable and revenue and expenditure
activity efficient. These measures hold the key to reversing the economic
contraction that has plagued the country for three years as well as the
secular decline of three decades.
2.          Bank Lending Strateav.  Because the public sector deficit is a
principal cause of macroeconomic instability, low investment and economic
stagnation, the objective of the Bank's program is to help the Government
recast the foundations of public finance to eliminate the structural deficit.
The proposed Public Sector Reform Loan (PSRL) would support changes in the
Federal Government and Central Bank. It would thereby complement a broader
Bank lending program focusing on public enterprises, provincial finances, and
social security reform. Taken together, these reforms are mutually
reenforcing, and imply a comprehensive modernization of the public sector, and
permanent reduction in the deficit. Achieving these objectives would help
reduce inflation permanently and provide a basis for new investment and
sustainable economic growth.
3.          Focus of the Loan.   The program for the Federal Government and
Monetary Authority is to reduce distortions in revenue mobilization, make
fiscal expenditures more efficient, and insulate the Central Bank from the
demands4 of the nonfinancial public sector for inflationary finance. Federal
expenditures comprise about half of the expenditures of the nonfinancial
public sector at the national level. The PSRL will contribute to the design
and financing of structural measures that would improve the efficiency of
current anu IrWvestment expenditures, increase revenues while reducing the
distortions in revenue mobilization, and rationalize public sector financing
by limiting recourse to money creation and by disentangling the Central Bank



- 56 -
Attachment IX
Page 2 of 2
from public finances.   The PSRL is also designed to provide a vehicle to
conduct a dialogue with authorities on macreconomic policy.
4.          Objectives of the Loan.  The proposed quick-disbursing loan
focusing on the federal administration and monetary authority would
specifically support major changes in (i) revenue mobilization through (a) tax
policy and administration to increase VAT revenues as well as impro e
collection efficiency (including a program to improve tax administration and
customs administration); and through (b) closing tax loopholes by reducing tax
subsidies for industrial promotion. The loan would also support (ii)
expenditure rationalization through (a) an administrative reform to reduce
federal employment by about 20 percent by end-1991, eliminate functions and
focus on core activities through ministerial reorganization, and provide
adequate incentives for civil service performance by reversing wage
compression from 2:1 to over 10:1 and strengthen administrative capacities;
and (b) improvements in the budget process through a new public finance law
(that will provide for consistent accounting, comprehensive budgeting, and
proper expenditure registration, control and auditing), a new law to reform
procurement procedures to lower implicit purchasing subsidies to state
suppliers, and stricter definitions of transfers to nonfederal components of
Government. Finally, the loan would help disentangle the financing of the
non-financial public sector through (iii) reform of the Central Bank and its
relation to the Treasury via (a) a new charter that would limit the powers of
the Central Bank to the Government; (b) removal from the Central Bank
functions inappropriate to a monetary authority, such as trade financing, bank
liquidations, and financing the social security payment system; and (c)
support its reorganization to focus on its primary mandate.
S.          Rationale for the Loan.  Without Bank technical assistance and
financing, the Government would have a far lower probability of being able to
implement a reform of this magnitude.  Bank financial assistance will allow
the Government to maintain imports at levels consistent with objectives for
low inflation and necessary reserve accumulation; the Government intends to
use the resources to help finance lay-offs from the public sector. Bank
technical support has already been instrumental in the design of policy
improvements to date and contemplated reforms.
6.          Cooperation with Other Financial Institutions.  The Bank is
working closely with the IMF and IDB in the formulation of the program. IMF
staff have consulted with the Bank on numerous occasions about specific
policies, and have adopted the Bank's recommendations in their own
negotiations with the Government.  The IDB intends to co-finance the PSRL and
has sent parallel missions with the Bank.
