MEMORANDUM AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT
OF THE INTERNATIONAL DEVELOPMENT ASSOCIATION
TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS
ON A PROPOSED CREDIT OF SDR 31.3 MILLION
TO THE REPUBLIC OF TOGO
FOR A TRANSPORT REHABILITATION PROJECT
1.        The following report on a proposed development credit to the
Republic of Togo for SDR 31.3 million (US$40 m equivalent) is submitted
for approval, The proposed credit would be on standard IDA terms with
40 years maturity and would assist in financing a Transport Rehabilita-
tion Project.
2.        Background  and  Strategy.   Togo's  transport  system  serves
national needs, provides an outlet for three landlocked countries and
assures an East-West transit link.  Transit traffic in ton-km exceeds
domestic transport. The competitive nature of transit traffic and the
openness of Togo's economy make an efficient low cost transport system
critical to the Government's development effort. The system comprises a
relatively  extensive  (about  7,500 km)  and  dense  (0.13 km/km2), but
insufficiently maintained road network; a mainl, private sector trucking
industry; a partially run down, lightly trafficked, loss-making railway
system  (about  500 km);  and,  at  Lome,  an  efficient  and  profitable
deep-water port and an international airport in need of passenger and
cargo handling capacity extensions. The Government recognizes the need
to gradually close uneconomic railway services and limit expenditures
mainly to rehabilitation and maintenance.  The Government's transport
sector strategy is to give priority to consolidating past investments,
to ensure that new infrastructure construction is economically justified
and to improve the efficiency of transport operations through better
cost recovery, institutional reform and continued privatization.  The
above strategy is in line with, and would support, the Government's
macroeconomic and structural adjustment policies.
3.        Rationale for IDA Involvement.  The rationale for IDA support
is to help the Government implement a coherent strategy for the trans-
port sector covering a realistic package of policy measures, institu-
tional developments and sector maintenance and investments based on
agreed objectives and annual reviews. This would reinforce preliminary
actions already taken by Togo under SAL 1I, i.e., increasing railway
tariffs and the budget allocation for road maintenance, and phasing out
an uneconomic railway line.  It would be in response to a Government
request that the Association assume a leading coordinating role in the
transport sector.
4.        Objectives.  The main objective of the project would be to
support the Government's sectoral program of improved use, maintenance
and selective rehabilitation of transport infrastructure.  This would
facilitate growth in agriculture, industry, and tourisn and preserve
Togo's major role in the sub-regional transit trade. The project would
also improve cost recovery and road safety, strengthen the institutional
framework, and stimulate the domestic construction sector. Finally, it
would protect essential transport and urban infrastructure from coastal
erosion.

5.        P*oject Description.  The project comprises the Government's
transport sector investment and maintenance program for the period
1988-1990 as well as sectoral policy and regulatory measures and train-
ing.  The program is reasonable in size and administratively feasible,
as it will incorporate measures to resolve the main constraints facing
road maintenance in the areas of funding, executing capacity and, to
some extent, general administrative procedures. Road rehabilitation and
expanded maintenance for all kinds of roads, including feeder roads,
account for about 70% of the project expenditures; new road construc-
tion, including bridges for existing roads, about 14%; coastal protec-
tion about 10%; technical assistance, training, and an element for
future studies account for another 4%, and road safety measures for 2%.
The total transport sector expenditure program will be reviewed annually
in light of needs, funding, and the results of economic and technical
studies.  The routine road maintcnance componient would concentrate on
two pilot provinces; a follow-up operation to extend this part and
consolidate the institutional achievements could be considered in the
light of Government performance under the proposed project. Due to the
magnitude of the coastal erosion along the coast of the Gulf of Benin,
the coastal protection component is limited to protecting the most
valuable assets and monitoring the littoral processes.  Financing for
parts of the program has been agreed in principle with AfDB, BOAD, CCCE,
FAC, FED, KfW, SFD, UNCDF and UNDP.
6.        Agreed Actions.  These fall into three categories.  Firstly,
during negotiations, agreement was reached on the foll-wing:  (a) the
scope of the 1988-1990 sector expenditure program, s eject to annual
reviews, with a minimum  12% ERR for each new project in *.Kcess of
CFAF 200 million; (b) a program to increase domestic funding for road
maintenance; (c) an action plan for institutional reform and strengthen-
ing of the Public Works Directorate; (d) the scope and timing of studies
concerning (i) a program for increasing road user taxes for heavy
vehicles taking into account sub-regional agreements and constraints;
and (ii) the financial status and prospects for the Togolese Railways,
including an action plan; and (e) a program to improve road safety.
Secondly, satisfactory proposals for restructuring the Directorate of
Public Works have been submitted for approval by the Council of Minis-
ters.  Thirdly,  (a) the establishment of the revolving fund for road
maintenance with an initial deposit of CFAF 300 million; (b) reorganiza-
tion of the Public Works Directorate and appointment of senior staff;
and (c) appointment of consultants for the Railway study would be
conditions of effectiveness.
7.        Justification  and  Benefits.   Lack  of  regularly maintained
roads and other infrastructure would increasingly become a deterrent to
economic activity, particularly agricultural development and the impor-
tant transit trade.  Rehabilitation and maintenance of roads and other
infrastructure have very high economic returns leading to substantial
savings of foreign exchange funds, as do improvements in road safety.
The coastal protection component would avoid a potentially calamitous
interruption of phosphate exports vital to the economy, and of trans-
port along the coastal road; loss of these services would result in
serious losses in export earnings and would require costly reconstruc-
tion.  The component would also minimize involuntary resettlement at
An6ho.

8.        Risks.  The main project risks are that the Government may not
be able to fully carry through the institutional aspects to resolve the
main constraints in mobilizing adequate funding for road maintenance,
and the possibility that some donors may offer to finance low-priority
investments. These risks are considered to be acceptable in the context
of the technical assistan:e and implementation arrangements designed for
*           the project and will be further reduced through close project monitoring
and coordination with other aid agencies.
*        R. Reoeadstion.  I am satisfie4 that the proposed credit would
comply wItli ' Aittciies ot Agreement of the Association and recommend
that the Executive Directors approve the proposed credit.
