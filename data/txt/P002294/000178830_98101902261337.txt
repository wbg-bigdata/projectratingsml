INTERNATIONAL DEVELOPMENT ASSOCIATION
REPORT AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT
TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS ON A PROPOSED CREDIT
TO THE REPUBLIC OF SENEGAL
FOR THE SECOND SEDHIOU PROJECT
1.        I submit the following report and recommendation on a proposed
development credit to the Republic of Senegal for the equivalent of US$6.3
million to help finance a second agricultural development project in Casamance.
The credit would be on standard IDA terms. Caisse Centrale de Cooperation
Economique (CCCE) of France would provide a loan of FF 14.2 million (about
US$3.2 million equivalent) to the Governmnent of Senegal for a term of 20
years, including 5 years of grace, with interest at 4.5 percent per annum.
PART I: THE ECONOMY
2.         A report entitled "The Economy of Senegal" (212-SE) was distributed
to the Executive Directors on September 10, 1973. A special mission on public
finance visited Senegal in October 1974; its findings are included in this
report. Country data appear in Annex I.
Past Developments
3.         I)uring the 1900's, the Senegalese economy experienced virtual
stagnation, as real outpult increased less rapidly than population, and per
capita GNP declined. Two factors were responsible for this situatLon. First,
with independence, Senegal lost its privileged position as the center of
French West Africa and therefore had to adjust to reduced economic, administra-
tive, and political dimensions. Secondly, the difficulties of adaptation to
the new situation were compounded in the latter part of the decade when
groundnut production felL by 50 percent due to unfavorable weather and falling
export prices. In 1971, weather conditions improved temporarily, but 1972 and
1973 brought the Sahel's most severe drought in this century. Food emergency
operations alleviated the drought's harmful effects, but both the fiscal and
balance of payments situations sharply deteriorated.
4.         Public savings net of amortization, which had substantially improved
during the preceding years, were all but wiped out in 1972/73 and 1973/74.
Revenues were affected by the decline in economic activity; and recurrent
expenditures were further increased by a rise in salaries to compensate for
the rapidly increasing cost of living, substantially higher debt service
payments, and perhaps most importantly, heavy consumer subsidies which result-
ed from maintaining low domestic prices in the face of skyrocketing food
import prices. Thus, at mid-1974, in spite of a US$46 million higher transfer
to the StabLlization Fund from groundnut sales than in the previous year, the
public finance situatior. was more serious than it had been since 1.960.
This document has a restricted distribution and may be used by recipients only in the performance
of their official duties. Its contents may not otherwise be disclosed without World Bank authorization.



5.         Faced with a difficult situation In public finance, the Government
took a number of steps in November 1974 which were expected to put public
finances on a sounder footing. Consumer prices for rice, sugar, and groundnut
oil were ralsed by 40 to 90 percent to bring them more closely in line with
world market prices and eliminate or drastically reduce subsidles. However,
high world market prices for wheat required an increase In domestic flour
prices whlch the Government was reluctant to pass on to the consumer and which
led to a subsidy on flour. To compensate for the rapid increase In basic food
prices, Government salaries were raised on average by 16 percent, wlth actual
increases ranging from 60 percent for the lower to 3 percent for the higher
salarles. Farmer prices for groundnuts were brought closer to world prices
which were partlcularly high at that moment. The Government thought It could
safely reduce its take from the groundnut crop since world phosphate prices
had increased five-fold. In addition, compensating revenues from the latter
source were assured through expanded government participation In the phosphate
mining company and a 100 percent tax levy on excess profits accrulng from the
prlce rise. However, a good part of the additional public savings was absorbed
by payments for the increased participation in the phosphate mine and the
servicing of debt incurred to finance new investments and state acquisitions
of two foreign-owned public utility companies.
6.         The balance of payments also came under pressure in 1973 and 1974,
in the former year because of a widening of the trade gap and in the latter
year because capital outflows from the private sector partly offset a substan-
tial improvement in the current account. Net foreign reserves at the end
of 1974 stood at minus US$44 million. In January 1975 Senegal drew its
full US$19.2 million allocation under the IMF oil facility.
7.         Balance of payments problems persisted through 1975 largely because
of cyclical factors. The good 1974 crop was harvested at a time when world
groundnut prices were still high; this created an atmosphere of optimism both
In the private and public sectors. At the end of 1974, the state marketing
organization purchased the crop from the farmers at generous prices thereby
injecting massive purchasing power into the economy. In summer 1975 private
and public expenditures were booming, but the bulk of the groundnut crop
remained unsold, world market prices were 30 percent lower than a few months
earlier, and foreign exchange reserves fell rapidly under the pressure of
excess demand. The Government responded by introducing selectlve credit
restrictions which so far have been effective in reducing total credit out-
standlng and stabllizing domestic inflation. Foreign exchange reserves stood
at minus US$66 million by the end of November 1975; this was financed by a
drawing in September of US$11.7 million under the second IMF oil facillty, by
the monetary union to which Senegal belongs, and by the mostly foreign-owned
commerclal banks.
8.        The first half of 1976 will see a continuatlon of the problems
experienced in 1975; the Government's reluctance to cut incomes of groundnut
farmers has encouraged it to maintain producer prices in the face of slack-
ening world demand for groundnut products. Unfortunately, phosphate rock
prlces are weakening as well; this will effectlvely eliminate the cushion



-3-
which has enabled Senegal to absorb the recent rises In oil and other import
costs while lmplementlng a policy of Income distribution in favor of the
rural areas. Hopefully, this income redistribution policy will not fall
victim to the current difficulties Senegal Is experlencing. There are strong
Indications that several OPEC countries are willing to provide increased
capital aid; moreover, there remain substantial sources of addltional balance
of payments assistance the Government can tap such as the IMF, Stabex and the
monetary union to which Senegal belongs. Finally, the Government has already
demonstrated its willingness to use credit restrictions and to elimlnate
costly consumer subsidles to maintain control over the short-term situation.
Prospects
9.        As demonstrated during the last five years, weather conditlons
and groundnut world market prlces remain critical for Senegal's growth pros-
pects. The Government is striving, with our support, to reduce its vulner-
ability to variances In these factors. Its long range program calls for
development of areas less affected by rainfall fluctuations (Casamance and
Eastern Senegal) where cash crops other than groundnuts can be grown. Irriga-
tion is being developed in the arid northern part of the country; this will
reduce dependence on cereal imports. With substantial gains also in industry,
tourism and fisheries, weather conditions and groundnuts by 1980 will be less
decisive factors than today. However, groundnut cultivation is the mainstay
of the economy and provides the livelihood for the majority of the rural poor.
The Government is, therefore, supporting the introduction of animal traction,
fertilizers and crop rotation techniques to raise the productivity of the
groundnut farmer.
10.       The Fourth Development Plan (1973/74 - 1976/77) continues to give
hlghest priority to rural development (36 percent of the total projected
investment during the Plan period), housing/public utilities (18 percent) and
transport infrastructure (16 percent). Industry and tourism, quite justifi-
ably, will have their share Increased from 5 to 10 percent during the Plan
period. Assuming average rainfall conditions, Senegal's growth in real terms
in the remainder of the 1970s will be of the order of 4.5 percent or about
2 percent per capita, whlch Is still a considerable improvement over the past
decade. A new plan is under preparation and will be reviewed in the course
of a basic economic mission scheduled for the Fall of 1976.
11.       The structure of Senegal's balance of payments will gradually im-
prove, but In the next few years the benefits of these favorable trends will
be reduced by falling terms of trade. Tourism, some new export industries
and an Important expansion of phosphate rock mining will provide additional
foreign resources, and the Implementation of existing irrigation plans will
progressively diminish the large food imports for urban centers. These
prospects combined with a favorable long-term outlook for groundnut produc-
tion should result in a healthier trade balance in the early eighties. The
favorable long-term prospects remain contingent on the execution of the
Investment program which will have 'to be largely financed from abroad at a
rate of about US$125 million annually on concessionary terms.     Traditional



- 4 -
sources of aid will probably not suffice, and it will take time before new aid
flows are developed. Therefore, for the coming two or three years supplemental
foreign funds, over and above foreseeable project aid, will be needed.
12.       The financial pressures of the past three years have already led
the Government to borrow on the Eurodollar market for a total amount of US$85
million, partly to roll over previous debts. Part of the expected balance of
payments deficits over the next two or three years could be financed through
access to the expanded IMF facilities or the Stabex fund; but additional
foreign exchange resources at a rate of about $25 million a year will pro-
bably be needed. Assuming that additional borrowing to cover the gap is done
on Eurodollar terms, debt service would increase from six percent of exports
of goods and non-factor services in 1975 to roughly ten percent by the end
of the 1970s.
PART II: BANK GROUP OPERATIONS IN SENEGAL
13.       The Bank Group has had 26 operations in Senegal to date, including
the Eastern Senegal Livestock Project approved by the Board earlier this
month. Total outstanding lending amounts to US$142.0 million, including
fifteen IDA credits, six Bank loans, two blends of Bank and IDA funds, two IFC
operations, and one blend of Bank and IFC funds. Annex II contains a summary
statement of Bank loans, IDA credits and IFC investments as of April 30, 1976
and notes on the execution of ongoing projects.
14.       Execution of these projects, apart from the Railway Project,
is moving forward without exceptional delays. The procurement for the railway
has been slow due to time consuming contract approval procedures, but most
components have now been received or ordered. Two agricultural credits
(140-SE and 404-SE) provided for technical assistance designed to facilitate
the reorganization of the Office National de Cooperation et d'Assistance au
Developpement (ONCAD); these programs did not achieve meaningful results.
Although Government took in early 1975 steps to strengthen ONCAD's management
and financial operations, ONCAD's overall performance has not improved. (see
Annex II).
15.       Ir, view of Senegal's need for substantially higher capital inflows,
the scale of Bank Group lending is expected to increase significantly in the
future. The Bank Group share of foreign aid disbursements (including grants)
is expected to increase from about 6 percent in 1970/71 to 24 percent over
the 1974-80 period. By then the Bank Group is likely to be the largest aid
donor. This will increase the Bank Group's share of the outstanding and dis-
bursed debt from 12 percent at the end of 1973 to about 25 percent by 1980.
IBRD/IDA share in public debt service will probably go up from 2.2 percent
in 1973 to about 8 percent by 1980.



- 5 -
16.       The objectives of Bank Group project lending in Senegal fall under
four main headings. Priority is being given to rural development, including
development of irrigation in the Senegal River Valley Region (e.g., the Debi-
Lampsar Engineering Credit), intensification of groundnut production and di-
versification into new crops and new regions (e.g., the Sine Saloum, Terres
Neuves and Livestock projects and the project described in this report). As
in the past, we would expect our agricultural lending over the next few years
to exceed one-third of the total. Secondly, we have supported diversification
of the economy by lending to the growing industrial sector through SOFISEDIT,
a development finance company established with assistance from the Bank Group
in 1974; two projects just appraised, one a second loan to SOFISEDIT and the
other a tourism development project on the Petite Cote, would further assist
this diversification objective. Thirdly, we have encouraged modernization and
expansion of the country's infrastructure through lending for highways, feeder
roads, railways, and the Port of Dakar; we propose to pursue this effort
through a second Dakar Port project recently appraised. Finally, Government
has asked us to help reorient and expand the country's education system; we
intend to identify a third education project next fall.
PART III:   THE AGRICULTURAL SECTOR
17.       Despite poor soils and erratic rainfall, agriculture is central to
Senegal's economy. Over the period 1971-75 it accounted for about one-third
of GDP and about half of Senegal's exports of goods. In 1975 the sector
employed 70% of the country's labor force and will continue to be the largest
source of employment for the foreseeable future. The rural population has an
annual per capita income averaging US$150.
18.       The agriculture sector has several important characteristics:   farms
of less than 10 ha account for 95% of all production; groundnuts account for
almost 70% of agricultural exports; 60% of the rural population is concen-
trated within about 100 miles of Dakar in the Groundnut Basin; and large areas
in the north and east of the country are suitable only for livestock produc-
tion under extensive grazing. There are significant variations in the distri-
bution of rural population, while cropping patterns differ little between
regions.
19.       The Ministry of Rural Development and Hydraulics (MDRH) has over-
all responsibility for agricultural development. Its most important instru-
ment has been the "Programme Agricole" (PA) which is implemented through
three main channels: (a) local cooperatives; (b) two national agencies --
ONCAD and Banque Nationale de Developpement du Senegal (BNDS); and (c) re-
gional development agencies.
Programme Agricole
20.       PA was started in the early 1960's with the aim of improving produc-
tion and productivity of groundnuts and cereals by providing credit to farmers
through cooperatives and ONCAD for acquisition of animal-drawn implements,
fertilizers, and improved seeds. From 1960 to 1968, production increased by



- 6 -
30%, and yields by 20%. Thereafter, yields and production of groundnuts
declined sharply in the drought years, and have since fluctuated with rain-
fall. Even in good rainfall years, however, output has not exceeded the
record levels of 1968. This suggests that PA in its present form may have
reached the limits of its potential and that further improvements require
stronger extension services promoting more advanced practices, particularly
heavier application of fertilizers and improved cropping patterns.
Cooperatives
21.       Cooperatives have been Government's principal instrument at the
local level for improving marketing and involving rural people in economic
development. Substantial progress has been achieved; Senegal now has about
2,200 cooperatives of which 1,700 are concerned with groundnuts and millet,
and virtually the entire rural population in the Groundnut Basin and in
Casamance is actively participating in the cooperative movement. For a
membership fee of CFAF 1,000, the participating farmer is entitled to
credit for fertilizers, pesticides and agricultural implements provided
under PA. Cooperatives distribute farm inputs, including seeds, to their
members and collect groundnuts and cereals produced by them for eventual
marketing by ONCAD, the state wholesaler.
22.       The management of the cooperatives has not been strong enough
to make them self-sufficient and Government plans to strengthen them.
First, they will be organized into unions that will each market at least
1,500 tons of groundnuts a year; and second, new regional development agen-
cies will train and supervise cooperative management to help them gradually
take over more of the responsibilities now being exercised by ONCAD.
Office National de Cooperation et d'Assistance pour le Developpement (ONCAD)
23.       ONCAD is a national agency created in 1966.   Its present objec-
tives are to: (a) assist and supervise cooperatives; (b) procure and de-
liver farm inputs to cooperatives on seasonal and medium-term credit pro-
vided by BNDS, and to recover such credit; and (c) organize, on a national
scale, the marketing of groundnuts and cereals, including imported rice.
24.       Although the marketing of groundnuts and credit recovery have im-
proved in many respects over the past five years, ONCAD's overall perform-
ance has been poor and its organizational and financial problems have lately
become crit:ical. The agency operates at a high cost and substantial delays
have occurred in both the delivery of inputs and transportation of ground-
nuts. Furthermore, ONCAD has not kept proper accounts or issued financial
statements on time, and it has substantial debts owed to it by the Stabili-
zation Fund.
25.       So far, ONCAD has only been able to continue its operations with
short-term credit provided by the Central Bank through BNDS. At the end of
last year ONCAD's current liabilities were tentatively estimated at about



US$200 million equivalent. About two-thirds of this is seasonal credit
to finance large inventories of cereals destined for market and stocks of
inputs and implements to be distributed to cooperatives; the balance is
to finance working capital pending payments due by the Stabilization Fund.
So far, ONCAD's financial situation per se has not affected the physical
implementation of agricultural projects supported by the Bank.
Banque Nationale de Developpement du Senegal (BNDS)
26.       BNDS was established in 1964 to provide financial and technical
assistance for development projects in the fields of agriculture, livestock,
fisheries, industry, commerce, handicrafts and housing. It is authorized to
provide financing through loans, guarantees or equity participation, and also
to conduct commercial banking activities and manage public funds.
27.       BNDS participates on the regional committees which determine each
year the credit limits for individual cooperatives. It provides the funds
for the procurement of inputs which are delivered by ONCAD to the cooperatives
and distributed by them to their members on credit. All credit to coopera-
tives is guaranteed by the cooperative movement against deposits made with
BNDS, by cooperatives ts well as by Government.
28.       In 1968 and 1970, BNDS ran into serious financial and organizational
difficulties. Government however took prompt action and, with technical
assistance financed by Credit 140-SE, had the bank reorganized and its finan-
cial and accounting procedures improved. BNDS benefited greatly from this.
Regional Development Agencies
29.       Semi-autonomous development agencies organized on either regional
or product lines, and reporting to MDRH, have begun to take over from the
Ministry responsibility for providing extension services to farmers. Three
such agencies have already been organized: (a) Societe de Developpement et
de Vulgarisation Agricole (SODEVA), has been given full responsibility for
extension in the Grounlnut Basin; (b) Societe d'Amenagement et d'Exploita-
tion des Terres du Deli:a (SAED), is responsible for irrigation development
in the Senegal river v.tlley; and (c) Societe pour le Developpement des
Fibres Textiles (SODEF'ITEX), formerly responsible for cotton development
only, is now concerned with all agricultural development in Eastern Senegal.
Two more such agencies are to be created, one for Casamance and the other
for the coastal region north of Dakar. Experience has shown that new cul-
tivation techniques can be rapidly introduced when PA is reinforced by
development agencies providing close extension supervision.
Price Policies
30.       Until 1974, Governemnt's price policies were urban-biased.    To
protect the purchasing power or urban consumers, the retail prices of im-
ported cereals, sugar and vegetable oil were heavily subsidized. This en-
couraged imports and discouraged local food production.   At the same time,



- 8 -
the farmgate price of groundnuts was set well below the corresponding export
level. This strained the balance of payments further by reducing the produc-
tion incentive for Senegal's principal export crop, and imposed a heavy tax on
farmers, which was transferred to a stabilization fund. The fund was used as
a supplementary source of revenue for Government and as a source of heavy
subsidies for fertilizer. The latter, together with subsidies on farm imple-
ments, somewhat improved the farmer's position but may have encouraged the
uneconomic use of inputs.
31.       Because of its difficult public finance situation, Government con-
cluded in late 1974 that it could no longer maintain the urban bias in its
pricing policies. It therefore embarked on a major revision of these poli-
cies which has had a substantial income distribution effect in favor of the
rural population. In November 1974, Government eliminated the subsidy on
imported rice and reduced those on sugar and vegetable oil. At the same
time, it increased the farmgate prices of groundnuts, cotton and cereals;
unfortunately, in 1975 the world market price of groundnuts fell by 25% in
comparison with the previous year, while inflation meant that the subsidies
on farm inputs cost as much as before. The Stabilization Fund now shows a
deficit and is unable to support either producer prices (its earlier surpluses
having been wiped out) or the fertilizer subsidy.
32.       Since 1969, the Bank has asked Government to reduce fertilizer sub-
sidies. The main Government argument is that they are necessary to promote
advanced farm technology, to prevent soil deterioration and to sustain produc-
tion. A study financed under Credit 404-SE, now underway, should provide data
on the production response to fertilizer; Government has agreed to take the
results of this study into account when establishing the future price struc-
ture for fertilizers. In the meantime, Government agreed at the negotiations
of the Sine Saloum project (Credit 549-SE) in April 1975 that it will progres-
sively adopt prices that more closely reflect the full cost of fertilizer, and
that it will consult with the Bank in October/November of each year on fertil-
izer subsidLes for the following campaign. Following discussions on the
latter in December 1975 Government decided to reduce the subsidies for common
fertilizer and urea from 73% and 80% respectively in 1974 to 56% and 30% in
1976. This is expected to result in a deficit of about US$9 million for the
Stabilization Fund in 1976 as compared with US$15 million in 1975.
33.       Similarly, during negotiations of the Sine Saloum project, Government
agreed to adopt progressively more realistic producer prices for the major
agricultural products and to consult with the Bank in April of each year on
the level of these prices for the following campaign. The first such discus-
sions were held in May 1976 on the occasion of the negotiations for the proj-
ect described in this report. Government informed the Bank of the new prices
for the 1976-77 campaign, mainly an increase of about 10% on average for
millet, maize and cotton and no changes for groundnuts and paddy. These
prices provide adequate incentives to farmers and are consistent with current
world market prices.



Ap,ricultural Development Strategy
34.       Government's objectives for agriculture are to increase the output
of export crops in order to improve foreign exchange earnings, and to raise
that of food crops in view of rising demand and imports. At the same time,
Government aims to diversify national output, in order to diminish the impact
of weather and price fLuctuations, and to reduce income disparities through
regional development programs.
35.       Accordingly, Government has undertaken projects to increase
groundnut and millet production and productivity, especially in the Ground-
nut Basin.  Given the concentration of people in that area, this is the
only practical short-term means for improving the livelihood of most of
the rural population. Since, however, the agricultural potential of the
Groundnut Basin is severely limited by unreliable rainfall, Government also
has programs underway to: (a) diversify production through rice and cotton
in rotation with groundnut and food crops in the higher rainfall areas of
Casamance and Eastern Senegal; (b) develop the irrigation potential of the
Senegal River; and (c) encourage migration of farmers from the heavily pop-
ulated areas of the Groundnut Basin towards Eastern Senegal.
36.       To continue implementing the strategy outlined above, Government
recognizes the need to modify many of its policies. Some changes are already
being made; others are necessary, but remain to be decided. With regard to
prices and marketing: first, subsidies should be eliminated as quickly as
possible to improve resource allocation and reduce the drain on public
finances; and second, ONCAD's input distribution and marketing functions
should be decentralized to the regional agencies and cooperatives in order
to improve efficiency and reduce costs.
37.       The establishment of regional development agencies is sound, be-
cause PA is not designed to provide the intensive supervision required to
move farmers to higher levels of productivity and because these agencies
have managerial and administrative advantages over Government departments.
However, they are not revenue earning and Government has so far relied
heavily on available external assistance to cover their costs. The Gov-
ernment is aware that exclusive reliance on external assistance to finance
the operation of the regional agencies would be imprudent in the long run.
Accordingly, and given the high priority of the agricultural sector in
Senegal's development strategy, the Government has decided to study the
necessary structural changes in the allocation of public savings (including
the review of subsidies) to ensure an adequate financial support to the re-
gional agencies.

PART IV: THE PROJECT
38.       The Government of Senegal has requested the assistance of IDA and
the French Caisse Centrale de Cooperation Economique (CCCE) in financing a
second phase of the Casamance Rice Project, Credit 252-SE, which was initiated
in 1971 in the Sedhiou district (see Map IBRD 11923 - Project Area) and is now
nearly completed. The objectives of the Second Sedhiou Project would be to
increase and diversify agricultural and livestock production and raise the
incomes of about 40% of the district's rural population. The project would
be based on improved farm practices successfully introduced under the first
project. The proposed project was prepared by the management of the first
project with the assistance of the Bank's Resident Mission in Western Africa
(RMWA) and consultants (INSTRUPA). It was jointly appraised by IDA and CCCE
in October 1975 and joint negotiations were held in May 1976 with a Senegalese
delegation led by His Excellency, Mr. Ousmane Seck, Minister of Planning and
Cooperation. The appraisal report (No. 1094a-SE) is being circulated sepa-
rately to the Executive Directors. Annex III provides a credit and project
summary.
Project Description
39.       The project's objective would be to encourage farmers to adopt im-
proved crop and livestock production techniques by supplying them with inputs,
credit and technical assistance. The project would bring the 4,150 farm
families (Category I) already participating in the first project to higher
levels of technology and induce 3,250 farm families (Category II) now using
traditional farming methods to adopt the improved cropping techniques which
have proved effective under the first project. In addition the project would
encourage 4,800 families from both groups to take up better livestock prac-
tices. It would also help strengthen cooperatives by management training and
by promoting the organization of cooperative unions.    The project would bene-
fit about 7,400 farm families (80,000 people in all), representing about 40%
of the rural population of the district.    It would be implemented during the
mid-1976/mid-1980 period by the management unit (PMU) established to carry out
the first project.
40.       The proposed project would consist of:
(a) strengthening the existing PMU to enable it to carry out its
additional responsibil Lties;
(b)  promoting the use of improved farm practices, such as destumping,
plowing, use of improved seeds, pesticides, fertilizers, different
cropping patterns and animal traction;
(c) promoting improved livestock husbandry through better animal
health care and use of supplementary feedstuffs;
(d) constructing and operating a feed mill;



- 11 -
(e) establishing water-control schemes for the improvement of
1,650 ha of paddy rice fields, and financing a soil and
hydrological survey of 15,000 ha of potentially irrigable
land (see Map IBRD 11924 - Water Control Scheme);
(f)  settling about 400 farm families on an abandoned Government
farm;
(g) providing training facilities for project staff and farmers;
(h) organizing the supply of farm implements, fertilizer, pesti-
cides, and seeds, and distributing these to project farmers
either for cash or under medium-term and seasonal credit
arrangements;
(i) installing 35 small cooperative-owned rice mills;
(j) strengthening cooperative institutions in the project area;
(k) monitoring and evaluating project activities; and
(1) financing a regional planning unit that would prepare a master
plan for the agricultural development of Casamance and which
would subsequently prepare one or more of the development
projects identified in such a plan.
Management and Organi2ation
41.        The management unit established under the first project, which has
proved satisfactory, would remain essentially unchanged. The project would
fall ultimately under the authority of a Regional Development Agency that
Government proposes tc establish for promoting and coordinating rural de-
velopment in Casamance' (see Section 3.01;(b) of the draft Credit Agreement).
Key project staff would comprise the Project Manager and five Division Chiefs
whose responsibilities would be as follows:
(a)  Extension:  promoting improved agricultural and animal husbandry;
training of field extension workers;
(b) Cooperatives: assisting and supervising cooperatives in credit,
procurement, input distribution and accounting; training of
cooperatives and union staff;
(c) Civil Works: preparing layouts and contracts for civil
engineering works, supervision of works, maintenance of project's
infrastructure, roads and equipment, including rice mills;
(d)  Planning and Evaluation:   programming and monitoring project's
activities and evaluating results; and
(e) Finance and Administration: financing, accounting, personnel,
general services and procurement.

Project Cost and Financing
42.       The total cost of the project based on mid-1976 prices, net of
taxes (US$2.0 million) but includLng contingencies, is US$12.9 million.
Foreign exchange costs are estimated at US$4.2 million, or 33% of costs net
of taxes. The proposed IDA credit of US$6.3 million would be complemented by
joint financing from CCCE equivalent to US$3.2 million. BNDS would contri-
bute US$1.9 million to finance incremental farm equipment and inputs through
seasonal and medium-term credit provided to farmers. Cooperatives would
contribute US$0.1 million to cover 10% of the costs of rice mill construction
and equipment. The balance of project costs would be financed by the Govern-
ment. The financing plan is, thus, as follows:
US$ Million       Percentage
IDA                          6.3               49
CCCE                         3.2               25
BNDS                         1.9               15
Cooperatives                 0.1                1
Government                   1.4               10
Total                  12.9              100
43.       Government and colenders' contributions would be passed on as a
grant initially to PMU, and afterwards to the Regional Agency. Colenders'
contributions would cover the equivalent of total foreign exchange costs
(US$4.2 million) and 61% of local costs (US$5.3 million). The latter would
include allowances paid to civil servants (US$1.3 million), comprising trans-
portation and housing, and arising as a direct result of the secondment of the
staff concerned to the project. The proposed financing, including that of
local costs, is justified, given the relatively low foreign exchange component
of this high priority project and considering the difficulties which Senegal
is facing in raising further its domestic savings in a period of deterioration
of its terms of trade. Total consultants' services would amount to 49 man/
months for a total cost of US$300,000 in current prices, or US$74,000 per
man/year on average.
Procurement
44.       The cost of civil works, equipment, farm implements, and vehicles
would total about US$5.1 million. Individual contracts for buildings, water-
control works, equipment and vehicles costing more than US$50,000 (aggregating
about US$3.4 million) would be awarded on the basis of international competi-
tive bidding in accordance with the Bank Group's guidelines for procurement.
Locally manufactured goods would be allowed a preference of 15% or the level
of applicable import duty, whichever is lower, when comparing domestic with
foreign bids. Contracts for less than US$50,000 (expected to total US$1.4
million), including small buildings and wells, would be awarded on the basis
of competitive bidding advertised locally and in accordance with procedures
which are satisfactory to IDA. Equipment purchases, such as office furnish-
ings and equipment for agricultural demonstrations, in amounts of less than
US$10,000 (totalling US$0.3 million) would be purchased directly from local
suppliers. Consultant services, including expatriate management staff (US$1.5



- 13 -
million), would be obtained according to IDA's normal procedures. Fertilizers
and pesticides (US$1.8 million), provided locally at competitive prices,
would be procured by ONCAD according to local procedures acceptable to IDA.
Seeds (US$0.4 million) would be procured directly by PMU from participant
farmers.
Disbursements
45.       The IDA cre&it would be disbursed pari passu with the CCCE loan in
the ratio of 2:1.   The proceeds of the IDA credit would be disbursed to cover:
(a)  50% of the costs of water control works and buildings---
US$0.67 million;
(b)  44% of the costs of vehicles--US$0.09 million;
(c)  53% of the costs of equipment--US$0.30 million;
(d)  44% of the costs of rice and feed mills civil works and
equipment, net of cooperatives' contribution--US$0.33 million;
(e)  67% of the costs of project personnel on contract and of
allowances paid to civil servants--US$2.90 million;
(f)  60% of the operating costs--US$0.53 million; and
(g) 67% of consLiltant services costs--US$0.15 million.
US$1.33 million would be held unallocated. Disbursements would be against
contracts and invoices for items (a), (b), (c), (d), for costs of expatriate
personnel in (e), and for item (g). Disbursements against local contracted
personnel in (e) and operating costs in (f) would be against statements of
expenditures certified by the Project's Manager and the Finance and Admin-
istration Division Chief, with the supporting documentation retained by PMU
and made available for inspection during supervision missions. It would be
conditions of disbursement against:    (i) the cost of establishing the re-
gional planning unit that the consultants required to carry out the master
plan for the agricultural development of Casamance and prepare follow-up
projects be employed with qualifications, experience and terms and condi-
tions satisfactory to IDA; (ii) the personnel and operating costs relating
to finalizing the above master plan and preparing follow-up projects that
the Government and IDA agree on the specific terms of reference of the con-
sultants responsible for such tasks; (iii) each annual investment program
in rice mills that the Government and IDA agree on each such program; and
(iv) the construction costs of the experimental polder that the results
of the soil and hydrological survey become available and that relating
recommendations be formulated in agreement between the Government and
IDA (Schedule I, para 3 of the draft Credit Agreement).

Benefits and Justification
46.       The project's direct benefits would be increases in output of
groundnuts, cereals, cotton and livestock products. At the end of the
four-year development period the net economic value of project-induced
incremental production in 1975 prices would be about US$4.1 million, rep-
resenting a contribution of about US$3.4 million to Senegal's foreign ex-
change earnings.
47.       The global impact on incomes of both categories of participating
farm families would be as follows: for the 4,150 families in Category I,
average income per capita, in 1975 prices, would increase from US$73 in the
year before the project to US$104 in the project's fourth year. For the
3,250 families in Category II, average income per capita would go up from
US$42 in the year before the project to US$66 in project year four. These
represent annual rates of increase of 9.% and 12%, respectively. In addi-
tion, about 65% of project farmers (4,800 families) would be involved in
project-supervised livestock production; average income per capita from such
activity, including cattle sales and on-farm consumption of meat and milk,
would increase from about US$5 to about US$10 during the project development
period.
48.       The economic rate of return of the project would be 23% over 15
years. Benefit decreases or cost increases of 20% would lower the project's
economic rate of return to 14% and 15%, respectively. The project is expected,
therefore, to bring a satisfactory return to the Senegalese economy.
49.       In addition to the directly quantifiable benefits derived from
increased production, the project would help organize cooperatives to deal
effectively with the procurement and distribution of farm inputs, marketing
of cereals and processing of paddy. It would also strengthen management and
organization of the new regional agency and identify rural development possi-
bilities in Casamance.
PART V: LEGAL INSTRUMENTS AND AUTHORITY
50.       The draft Development Credit Agreement between the Republic of
Senegal and the Association, the Recommendation of the Committee provided in
Article V, Section I(d) of the Articles of Agreement of the Associaiton and
the text of a draft resolution approving the proposed credit are being dis-
tributed to the Executive Directors separately.
51.       Features of the draft Credit Agreement of special interest include:
(i) those referred to in paragraphs 41 and 45 of this report, (ii) cross
remedies in case of suspension or default under the CCCE loan agreement
(Sections 5.01 and 5.02 of the draft Credit Agreement), and (iii) an addi-
tional condition of effectiveness, namely that conditions of effectiveness
under the CCCE loan agreement have been met.

at appraisal have so far been reached. Adequate rainfall ensured a satisfac-
tory 1975/76 campaign, although maize production suffered from heavy rains.
Because of cost overruns, mainly due to the Increased number of extenslon
staff, salary increases and changes in the US dollar exchange rate, funds
available under the Credit will be insufflcient to cover all expenditures
required. However, Government has made available US$960,000 to finance
project implementation between July 1975 and June 1976. Together with un-
disbursed IDA funds (IJS$500,000) thls would ensure enough money to maintain
project activities untll funds available under the second project can be
dlsbursed.
Cr. 253        Technical and Agricultural Education Project; US$2.0 Million
Credit of June 18, 1971; Effective November 30, 1971;
Closing Date: October 1, 1976
All components except the University Institute of Technology (IUT)
have been Implemented., This Item is expected to be completed shortly.
Delay has been due largely to technical problems. A cost overrun of about
US$500,000 on the pro;ject as a whole Is anticipated, which the Government will
flnance.
Cr. 254        Terres Neuves Settlement Project; IJS$1.35 Million
Credit of June 18, 1971; Effective January 31, 1972;
Closing Date: December 31, 1977
The project's settlement program was completed in 1974 as antlcl-
pated at appraisal.  The project has been successful in provlding hlgher in-
comes than expected for settlers and has attracted families with more adult
workers than anticipated in 1974. 300 families have been settled as envi-
saged and there are atout 2,300 people in the six settler villages.    There
are adequate water supply facllities and the necessary social infrastructure
is being completed. Adequate and evenly distributed rainfall ensured good
crops during the last seasons. Societe des Terres Neuves (STN) (the State
Corporation in charge of the project) is taking measures to solve the major
problems relating to flnancial management, audlt and project monitorlng.
The credit is expected to be fully dlsbursed in the near future.

Cr. 314/Ln. 835     Second Railway Project:   US$3.2 Million and
US$6.4 Million Credit and Loan of June 23, 1972;
Effective December 29, 1972; Closing Date: June 30,
1976
The origlnal project was substantially modified to reduce track
renewal works In favor of funds for spare parts for track laying and mainte-
nance equipment and for locomotives. By the end of 1975, US$6.0 million had
been disbursed out of the total Loan/Credit of US$9.6 million; track renewal
had been completed, as well as procurement for workshop rehabilitation and
orders had been placed for all track equipment and spare parts for locomo-
tives under the project; bids for the civil works to rehabilitate the work-
shops had been submitted and were being analyzed. In recent months, as a
result of sustained efforts by supervlslon missions, the railway has been
granted financial autonomy, locomotive avallability has been increased result-
ing in a higher carrying capacity, and steps have been taken to strengthen
technical asslstance. Much improvement is still needed, however, in manage-
ment efflciency, and a proposed Third Railway Project, scheduled for FY 1977,
will focus on this. A drop in international traffic (end of the Mali drought
relief program) and In phosphate traffic (slump in world phosphate market) has
weakened railway finances.
Cr. 336              Site and Services Project; US$8.0 Million Credit of
September 29, 1972; Effective August 31, 1973;
Closing Date: June 30, 1979
Progress in project execution continues to improve, although at a
slow pace. The absence of a program of community development activities
is critical at this juncture and considered fundamental in the promotion of
a vLable community. Thus, a second and follow-up project, has been outlined
aimed essentially at filling this vacuum. Sales contracts for about 1,200
plots have been signed. Plot occupation cannot occur before June 1976, be-
cause of delays In physical works. A further complication is the absence of
a credit line for housing and materials to the project population. Civil
works are proceeding on the second tranche and expected to begin in July 1976
on the third and fourth tranches. Work on the Thies site is expected to begin
in January 1977. With the reduction of the IDA dlsbursement percentage from
67% to 45%, sufficient funds are available to execute two of the three tranches
in the Thies component. The OHLM staffing situation has significantly improved,
and the transfer of responsibilities to a counterpart team almost completed.
The project will continue to receive close supervision to ensure a reasonable
pace of implementation.

Ln. 866             Telecommunications Project; US$6.25 Million Loan of
December 19, 1972; Effective June 5, 1973; Closing Date:
December 31, 1976
Large cost overruns have raised the cost of this project from
US$8.9 million at appraisal to US$19.9 million according to recent estimates.
A co-financing formula was successfully worked out which included a loan from
the French Caisse Centrale de Cooperation Economique (CCCE) of US$4 million,
new French suppliers' credits of US$4 million, and an increased contribution
from our borrower, Office des Postes et Telecommunications du Senegal (OPTS).
The new financial packcage and conditions of the CCCE loan were accepted by the
Senegalese Government and the agreement would enable the project to be com-
pleted as originally appraised. However, recently OPTS has been informed
that the Government intends to levy an income tax on OPTS's profits from
operations in FY 1975 and also for previous years. OPTS has never before
been subject to tax. This change of policy towards the OPTS is causing doubts
about the financing pLan drawn up at the time the CCCE loan was negotiated.
These matters are being discussed with the CCCE and the Government.
Ln. 867             Airport Project; US$3.0 Million Loan of December 19, 1972;
E_fective May 22, 1973; Closing Date: June 30, 1976
All project work was completed, the runway in full operational serv-
ice and the loan fully disbursed by the end of January 1976. The total cost
of the project did nol: exceed the CFA franc costs made at appraisal although
the devaluation of the US dollar resulted in the proceeds of the Bank loan fi-
nancing a smaller percentage of the works than originally contemplated.
Cr. 350             River Polders Project; US$4.5 Million Credit of January 9,
1973; Effective June 8, 1973; Closing Date: December 31,
1977
Procurement has been completed for the main components of the project
and contracts have been awarded. Construction of works is progressing satis-
factorily. The Senegalese authorities requested that the Debi/Lampsar compo-
nents of the project lie deleted from Credit 350-SE and be reformulated within
the broader framework of integrated development of the Senegal River Basin.
The proposed reformulation was agreed upon by IDA and an engineering project
for Debi/Lampsar was appraised in December 1974 and approved by the Board
in April 1975. The credit was fully disbursed by the end of March 1976.
Because of price increases, US dollar devaluation and additional works, the
proceeds of the credit: were not sufficient to complete the projects, despite
the deletion of the Debi/Lampsar component. The project authority SAED
(Societe d'Amenagement. et d'Exploitation des Terres du Delta), is presently
seeking supplementary financing from Government of about US$3.6 million to
complete the project.

1973; Effective November 28, 1973; Closing Date:
December 31, 1978
Implementation of the maintenance program and engineering studies
started about six months behind schedule and execution at the beginning was
slow but has improved since 1975. Engineering studies for the next phase of
pavement strengthening were completed during the first half of 1975. Work
on pavement strengthening began in February 1975, about 18 months later than
appraisal estimates. The pavement strengthening component originally com-
prising 109 km of road rehabilitation had to be reduced to 35 km due to higher
construction costs than expected at appraisal, changes in the exchange rate of
the US dollar and the shifting of funds from pavement strengthening to higher
priority road maintenance.
Cr. 404             Second Agriculture Credit Project; US$8.2 Million Credit
of June 25, 1973; Effective November 28, 1973;
Closing Date: June 30, 1977
The 1974/75 campaign was good: groundnut and cereal production
(1.0 million and 0.7 million tons, respectively) reached their highest levels
since 1969. Demand for short and medium-term credit under the 1975/76 campaign
remained stronger than anticipated, but available credit funds were sufficient
to cover requirements for this campaign, the output of which is expected to be
even higher than that of 1974/75. Government has eliminated the subsidy on some
farm implements and reduced the subsidy on fertilizers from about 73% to 56% of
actual cost. However, the on-going study on fertilizer applications financed
under the Credit should provide a basis for policy review. Major organizational
and financial problems still exist at ONCAD despite technical assistance pro-
vided since 1969. Steps taken by Government in early 1975 to remedy this
serious situation--maintaining staff level, giving ONCAD management more fi-
nancial autonomy and strengthening it with qualified accountants--resulted in
some improvement, especially in accounting. However, ONCAD's overall per-
formance has not improved and the organization remains overstaffed. ONCAD
credit requirements attained record levels, partly because of accumulating
operating losses but mainly because of the large groundnut and millet stocks
and prolonged prefinancing for Government's account.
Ln. S-3              Ship Repair Engineering Loan:  US$0.6 Million Loan of
September 20, 1973; Effective February 5, 1974;

The studles have now been completed; they Indicate low economic and financial
returns, and a relatively high market risk. The Government is exploring pos-
slble financing and ways of reducing the market risk.
Cr. 446             Drought Relief Project; US$3.0 Million Credit of
December 7, 1973; Effective February 5, 1974j
Closing Date: January 31, 1977
The project Is part of the Senegalese plan to rehabilitate people in
drought affected areas by assisting them to redevelop and improve their farms
and lands. Operations, including strengthening of health and water supply
services, have been proceeding satisfactorily and the project is expected to
be completed on schedu'Le.
Ln. 987              SOFISEDIT Project; US$3.0 Million Loan of May 24, 1974;
EfEective November 22, 1974; Closing Date: December 31,
1978
SOFISEDIT was created by the Government in March 1974 for the pur-
pose of providing long-term financing for industry and tourism development.
To recruit the initial staff and to find office 'space took several months and
the company did not start operations until November 1974.   During its first
fiscal year of operations which ended September 30, 1975, SOFISEDIT approved
nine loans totaling US$2.4 million and three equity investments for a total
of US$320,000.  The loan to SOFISEDIT is expected to be fully committed by
the end of 1976 and a second project was appraised in December 1975.
Cr. 530              Second Educatlon Project;  US$15.0 Million Credit of
Fe'bruary 19, 1975; Effective April 22, 1975;
Closing Date: June 30, 1980
The project management unit has been strengthened and is function-
ing well. Design work on the four lower secondary schools is well advanced
and is proceeding satisfactorily in the case of the lower secondary science/
technology centers. Construction at the Dakar Industrial Worker,Upgrading
Center has begun and a tender has been issued for the National Marine Training
School. Equipment lists and bills of quantities of construction materials for
the nonformal rural youth training program have been approved by IDA. The
Hotel/Tourism Training Center-is delayed due to prolonged contract negotlations
between the Government and the selected architectural consulting firm. Also the
Government has yet to complete the terms of reference for a prefnvestment study
of primary education.

SECOND SEDHIOU PROJECT
CREDIT AND PROJECT SUMMARY
Borrower:           Republic of Senegal.
Amount:              US$6.3 million.
Terms:               Standard.
Project
Description:       The project would encourage farmers in the Sedhiou district
of Casamance to adopt improved crop and livestock produc-
tion techniques by supplying them with inputs, credit and
technical assistance. The project would carry the 4,150
farm families already participating in the first project
to higher levels of technology and Induce 3,250 farm
families now using traditional farming methods to adopt
the improved cropping techniques whlch have proved ef-
fective under the first project. In addition the project
would encourage 4,800 families from both groups to take
up better livestock practices. It would also help
strengthen cooperatives by management training and by
promoting the organization of cooperative unions. The
project would benefit about 7,400 farm families (80,000
people in all), representing about 40% of the rural popu-
latlon of the district. It would be implemented during
the mid-1976-mid-1980 period by the management unit estab-
lished to carry out the first project.

Procurement
Arrangements:      The cost of civil works, equipment, farm implements, and
vehicles would total about US$5.1 million.    Individual
contracts for buildings, water-control works, equipment
and vehicles costing more than US$50,000 (aggregating
about US$3.4 million) would be awarded on the basis of
international competitive bidding in accordance with the
Bank Group's guidelines for procurement. Locally manu-
factured goods would be allowed a preference of 15% or
the level of applicable import duty, whichever is lower,
when comparing domestic with foreign bids. Contracts for
less than US$50,000 (expected to total US$1.4 million)
including small buildings and wells, would be awarded on
the basis of competitive bidding advertised locally and in
accordance with procedures which are satisfactory to IDA.
Equipment purchases, such as office furnishings and equip-
ment for agricultural demonstrations, in amounts of less
than US$10,000 (totalling US$0.3 million) wcould be pur-
chased directly from local suppliers.    Consultant serv-
ices, including expatriate management staff (US$1.5 mil-
lion), would be obtained according to IDA's normal proce-
dures. Fertilizers and pesticides (US$1.8 million),
produced locally at competitive prices, would be procured
by ONCAD according to local procedures acceptable to IDA.
Seeds (US$0.4 million) would be procured directly by PMU
from participant farmers.
Consultants:         Total consultants' services would amount to 49 man/months
for a total cost of $300,000 in current prices, or US$74,000
per man/year on average.
Rate of return:      nte economic rate of return of the project is estimated
at. about 23% over 15 years.
