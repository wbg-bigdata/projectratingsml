 Risks and Risk Mitigation   Corruption poses risks for the realization o f the full benefits o f
                             increased infrastructure investment, and reputational risks for the
                             Bank. The procurement reforms included as triggers are part o f
                             the Bank's anti-corruption effort. More generally, I D P L triggers
                             support greater transparency and accountability through improved
                             planning processes, and greater competition and transparency in
                             the development o f PPPs. Bureaucratic capacity i s a constraint on
                             the pace o f reform. Technical assistance i s provided to mitigate
                             the risks.
                             Government commitment to reform i s considered to pose low

         PROPOSED THIRD INFRASTRUCTURE DEVELOPMENT POLICY LOAN
                              TO INDONESIA

                                            .
                                           I INTRODUCTION

1.      Indonesia's commitment to infrastructure reform and improved infrastructure services has not
wavered in 2009, despite the international financial crisis and parliamentary and presidential
elections. Particular highlights for the year include a substantial infrastructure element in the
Government's March fiscal stimulus package, reforms intended to increase sub-national government
spending on piped water services, and implementation o f recent reforms o f land acquisition processes.

2.       The Infrastructure Development Policy Loan (IDPL) series recognizes the' Government's
reform progress and also serves as a central element o f the infrastructure reform dialogue between the
Bank and the Government. The four-loan program i s built around four areas o f engagement: national
infrastructure (eg electricity and roads); sub-national infrastructure (eg water); public-private
partnerships; and cross-cutting governance issues including land acquisition, environment, and
procurement. The common theme in each o f these areas i s increasing the amount and effectiveness o f
infrastructure spending, in order to contribute to economic growth and poverty reduction.

3.       The I D P L program seeks to address the infrastructure backlog that arose following the 1997
Asian financial crisis, when infrastructure investment f e l l from over 7% o f GDP to just over 2% in
2001 (see Figure 1). Infrastructure investment has since risen to over 3% o f GDP, but this level o f
investment has been insufficient to meet the growing demand from existing infrastructure users, or to
address the needs o f the large parts o f the population who do not have access to basic infrastructure
services. The decline in investment was particularly dramatic in the energy sector, and i s now
resulting in widespread blackouts and load-shedding. Investment in water and sanitation has long been
insufficient to expand access to piped water or to begin to develop sewerage systems. Transport
investment has held relatively steady as a proportion o f GDP, but realizing the potential benefits o f an
expanded expressways network and urban mass transport systems i s likely to require significant
additional resources beyond current investment levels.

4.      The Government's infrastructure program addresses these challenges, and the I D P L program
recognizes the most significant elements o f the Government's program. The current single-tranche
operation, for a proposed U S $ 250 million, i s the third loan o f the IDPL series. The I D P L policy

                                                     3
matrix i s set out at Annex 9. The current operation focuses on the most important infrastructure
reform achievements o f 2009, "prior actions" which are critical for the objectives o f the program:

        The Government i s developing a scheme o f output-based grants to sub-national governments
        when evidence i s provided o f new working piped water connections for poor households.
    a   The level o f infrastructure investment by key Government ministries has been substantially
        increased, providing an important foundation for higher economic growth.
        The Government has prepared revisions to Perpres 67, the law which governs infrastructure
        PPPs, extending i t s operation to PPPs o f sub-national governments;
        The Government i s improving the accuracy and transparency o f electricity subsidy forecasts,
        providing greater impetus towards ultimately reducing the subsidy.
        The Government i s establishing new institutions to improve the availability o f long-term
        financing for infrastructure PPPs.
        Recent legal reforms are now facilitating land acquisition for infrastructure projects.
        The Ministry o f Public Works Director General o f Highways (Bina Marga) has established an
        internal taskforce to provide advice and assistance to the procurement committees that are
        responsible for individual procurement processes.

5.      A broader subset o f the Government's program i s supported by a parallel series o f policy
loans by the ADB and the Government o f Japan.' The policy matrix adopted by the ADB and Japan
(set out at Annex 3) gives explicit recognition to a broad range o f the Government's reforms. The
separate series complement each other, with the World Bank's loan series ensuring heightened
attention to the most critical reforms, and the ADB and Japanese series assisting to maintain
momentum across the breadth o f the Government's program. There i s close coordination between the
agencies to ensure consistent messages.

6.      The Country Partnership Strategy, approved in September 2008, provides that D P L loan
amounts will be related to the extent o f policy progress. There i s already evidence o f significant
progress towards achievement o f the overall program's objectives for 2010, as set out in Annex 7.

7.        Because o f the political calendar and the incumbent government's desire to secure financing
o f the 2009 budget prior to the transition, the Government has requested earlier preparation and
approval o f the I D P L than in past years. Given the progress to date on the prior actions and the strong
likelihood in the aftermath o f the July presidential elections that the direction o f reforms will remain
unchanged and the overall commitment to reforms will remain strong and possibly even intensify, the
Bank considers that sufficient progress has been made to justify presentation o f IDPL3 to the Board in
late September, and has responded positively to the Government's request for accelerated processing
o f the loan.

8.       Indonesia has made remarkable progress over the last decade in terms o f macroeconomic and
political stability. Macroeconomic performance since the late 1990's has seen consistent output
growth and rapid decline in external imbalances. Increasing tax revenues have contributed to the
decline in the fiscal deficit. Increased growth has been grounded on increasing private sector
investments and sustained domestic consumption. Under a scenario o f controlled inflation and
moderate interest rates Indonesian citizens managed to improve their living standards and reduce
poverty levels. I addition, as the result o f a sustained decade o f relatively successful political and
                  n
institutional reforms, Indonesia in 2009 i s a highly competitive, decentralized electoral democracy.
Governments at national, provincial, district and city level are elected in free contests, with an
incumbent loss rate o f about 40 percent (one o f the highest o f any competitive democracy). A system
o f checks and balances between legislative, judicial, and executive branches i s increasingly in place,
with no one branch o f Government able to dominate, and few institutional outcomes `guaranteed'.
Where power was once radically concentrated around the presidency, it i s now shared with the
legislature and where power was once concentrated in Jakarta, it i s now shared among 500 odd city,
district and provincial Governments.

9.       The foundation o f macroeconomic and political stability established in the last decade has
helped Indonesia weather the current global economic crisis. Indonesia's growth slowdown has come
relatively later and been more moderate than for most countries. But the global downturn, lower
global commodity prices, and tighter global financing will mean slower growth in 2009 and 2010
compared with recent years. Public finances however remain in good health, with the budget barely in
deficit in 2008 (-0.1 percent o f GDP) and public debt ratios continuing their secular decline. With a
strong fiscal position, Indonesia should be able to cushion the adverse effects o f the global crisis on
vulnerable groups, and provide additional resources for development priorities. In the period 2010-14,
the budget i s expected to increase by more than 30 percent in real terms when compared to the 2005-
2009 period (about US$500 billion in 2008 prices) creating significant opportunities to improve
public services. But in order to seize these opportunities Indonesia will need more effective and
accountable institutions that can translate available resources into better development outcomes. This
will be particularly important as Indonesia embarks on a period o f second generation reforms to
provide, for example, more sophisticated services in infrastructure, better education, and a sustainable
health system.

THE STATE OF THE INDONESIAN'ECONOMY ENTERING MID-2009
 10.     Indonesia's slowdown came relatively later and has been more moderate than for many
countries. GDP growth in the second quarter o f 2009 slowed to 4.0 percent y-0-y, stronger than most
commentators had expected and a relatively modest 2.4 percent points slower than in the year to the
third quarter 2008. (Figure 2) Quarterly data suggest that growth passed i t s trough by the second
quarter. For 2008 as a whole the Indonesian economy expanded by 6.1 percent, only slightly below
2007's 6.3 percent pace. Indonesia's growth held up longer, and the slowdown at the end o f the year,
while sharper than generally expected, was less dramatic than elsewhere in the region. (Figure 3).
Nevertheless, the slowdown late in the year was broad-based as private consumption, exports and
investment all declined, with only weaker imports and expanding Government spending providing
some offset. Through the f i r s t half o f 2009, the most externally-oriented parts o f Indonesia's
economy continued to be impacted by the bleaker global conditions. But domestic demand recovered
somewhat, led by private and Government consumption and the industries supplying that demand,
although this in at least part appears to be due to spending related to the parliamentary and
presidential elections. A notable outlier to the general slowdown was the increase in agricultural
production o f 4.8 percent in 2008, the highest growth since 1992. While agriculture now accounts for
14.4 percent o f total output, it continues to provide most or all o f the income for 42 percent o f
households and solid growth prospects in that sector appear to be feeding into broader economic
confidence.

 11.     After several years o f strong and sustained growth, lifted by rising commodity prices, the
global downturn hit Indonesia's trade flows in late 2008 and early 2009. Indonesia's total exports
reached USD 136 billion in 2008, 20 percent above 2007's exports. But, the fall in commodity prices
and, to a lesser extent, the compression in global demand had the anticipated impact on exports in the
months around the turn o f 2009. The fall in exports in January was the largest in a decade. The
dramatic decline in o i l prices and associated falls in other commodity prices drove much o f this
decline in value. Real exports (in the GDP a measure o f volume) started falling in the third quarter o f
2008, and by the first quarter o f 2009 were almost one-fifth lower than a year earlier (although this
fall may be overstated due to issues with the national accounts price deflators). The second quarter
brought some recovery, with trade volumes rising 7.4 percent, and the recovery in global commodity
prices lifting values by even more (17 percent) compared with the first quarter. Imports are closely
linked to exports and to the rundown o f inventories o f intermediate goods, so they f e l l rapidly as well:
the value o f Indonesia's imports in the first quarter o f 2009 was just over half that o f the peak just two
quarters earlier, while volumes dropped 30 percent over this period. These falls have been
concentrated in intermediate and other energy imports, down 53 percent y-0-y at the February 2009
trough; capital and transport equipment imports in the f i r s t quarter o f 2009 were one-third lower than
in the final quarters o f 2008. Like exports, imports also recovered in the second quarter, by 18 percent
in value terms and 8 percent after accounting for the increase in prices. The net effect o f these falls
was some compression o f Indonesia's merchandise trade surplus which declined from USD 5.8 bn in
4 3 to USD 4.6 bn in 44. This surplus recovered through the first half o f 2009 to USD 7.8 bn in 4 2
(provisional estimate) as, in the first months o f the year, the falls in import values were even more
dramatic than those in exports, and then both recovered at similar rates.

 12.     With lower global commodity prices cutting profits and weakening demand f i r m s have
reduced investment. As noted above, a l l categories o f domestic private demand slowed during the
period o f peak turbulence on global financial markets in the fourth quarter o f 2008. Investment
spending slowed further through the first half o f 2009: by 4 2 machinery & equipment spending was
11.5 percent lower than a year earlier, although growth in construction spending remained robust.
Indonesia did not see the retrenchment in industrial output experience elsewhere in the region: at the
trough in January 2009, industrial output was down 1.7 percent y-0-y, and by May it was 1.8 percent
higher than a year earlier. W h i l e the falls in vehicle production, cement sales, and industrial electricity
consumption were deeper in the first quarter, a l l were recovering in the second quarter.

 13.     In contrast, households appeared to have recovered confidence in the f i r s t quarter. Stable
prices (discussed below) and incomes were further supported by the final tranche o f the unconditional
cash transfer program, spending associated with the legislative elections, and, for rural households, a
strong harvest. W h i l e there are anecdotal reports o f perhaps hundreds o f thousands o f layoffs,
especially from contract labor-hire firms, this appears to have been absorbed elsewhere in the labor
force with the open unemployment rate falling by 0.3 percentage points to 8.1 in February 2009
compared with a year earlier. These factors lifted consumer confidence to 4-year highs, and recent
retail sales indicators have picked up too (Figure 6). Demand for consumer durables, notably
motorcycles and motor vehicles, dipped in the fourth quarter and continued to fall into January before
recovering somewhat in the following months, although compared with the highs o f mid-2008 motor
vehicle sales were down 28 percent and motorcycles down 11 percent (compared with June 2008)
(Figure 7).

14.     Indonesian financial markets have followed the downs and ups o f recent global trends, and
did not suffer a lasting impact from the mid-July Jakarta bombings. After being severely affected in
October and early November, they strengthened with renewed global confidence from late November,
before weakening again in mid-January as market participants' perceptions o f the global situation
deteriorated again. Through the northern spring, Indonesian financial markets recovered by more than
most. This partly reflected the higher sensitivity o f Indonesia's financial markets to developments in
global markets and investor risk appetites. I t also reflected Indonesia-specific developments, including
the Government shoring up its financing through front-loaded bond issuance and entry into a
contingent financing scheme with i t s development partners, the relatively high roll-over and re-
financing rate o f private external liabilities, the general robustness o f the domestic economy, and the
orderly parliamentary and presidential elections. Thus after settling around 11,000 per USD in
December, the rupiah depreciated gradually to well over 12,000, before recovering again to below
 10,500 from early May and around 10,000 from late July (Figure S), one o f the largest appreciations
against the USD in the region. Markets weakened in the hours immediately following the July 17th
twin bombings in Jakarta, but recovered within a day or two and market commentators did not expect
a lasting impact (Figure 9).

 15.     Yields on Indonesian Government bonds, which were especially affected by the global
instability, have returned to the levels o f early 2008. By the end o f 2008 Indonesian Government bond
yields had recovered much o f their October and November losses (when, for example, the five year
bond yield rose to over 20 percent), but were s t i l l at relatively elevated levels. They then retreated
again in line with renewed global risk aversion in the f i r s t quarter o f 2009. As the Government filled
much o f its financing needs early in the year (discussed below), and global risk aversion declined,
Indonesian bond yields f e l l further. Shorter-tenor bonds have recovered most, as the central bank cut
the overnight policy rate and reduced the yields on short-term certificates; longer-dated bonds also
benefited from the post-March reduction in risk averseness. The premium on Indonesian Government
bonds denominated in IDR relative to those denominated in USD narrowed drastically early in 2009,
although by early May the yields on USD bonds especially have recovered somewhat, and the
premium returned to early 2008 levels. Non-residents have also recovered some confidence in
Indonesian Government bonds. They cut their holdings from IDR 107 tr or about 20 percent o f the
total stock at the end o f August 2008 to a low o f IDR 78.7 tr in mid-March, but, with the turn-around
in global financial markets and especially with growing confidence in Indonesia, they became net
purchasers, increasingtheir holdings to about IDR 91 tr or 16.5 percent o f the total by mid August.

 16.     Indonesia's bankers have strengthened their balance sheets in recent years and have little
direct exposure to the financial sector stresses o f U and European banks, but lending growth has
                                                       S
slowed somewhat. In late 2008 bankers cut their loan approvals, especially for SMEs and new
customers, according to anecdotal reports, as bankers become more conservative towards
consolidating their balance sheets in anticipation o f an as yet unrealized increase in non-performing
loans (Figure 12). Total lending grew by only 2 percent over the first half o f 2009. But this slowdown
in lending contrasts with the rapid lending growth o f the first half o f 2008 rather than deviating from
longer-run levels, and it also reflects lower demand for credit as f i r m s reduce their working capital or
lower commodity prices cut financing needs, and credit lines have gone undisbursed. While interbank
lending has been improving since November and there i s sufficient overall rupiah liquidity in the
system, reports suggest that it i s not well distributed with larger banks typically liquid and while
smaller banks have less market access. Other banking sector indicators continue to suggest the sector
remains in relatively good health overall, with banks lifting their capital-to-assets ratio. Non-
performing loan ratios increased marginally at the start o f 2009 and then stabilized (although the data
for April should incorporate the impact o f economic disruption o f November and December given the
lags in defining and reporting non-performing loans) (Figure 13).

 17.     Inflation has fallen sharply with the fall in commodity prices. Reductions in international
prices have passed into domestic and regulated prices (as f u e l prices have been adjusted downward).
Consumer prices have stabilized: they barely increased between November 2008 and June 2009, and
the seasonal increases in July were less than usual, reducing the year-on-year inflation rate to 2.7
percent from a peak o f over 12 percent in September 2008 (Figure 14). This i s despite the rupiah's
deprecation o f up to one-third during this period. The inflation rate has fallen even more for poorer
households whose consumption basket has a greater weight in food. Consumer inflation expectations
are now at their lowest level since early 2005, when actual inflation was running close to 5 percent.
Upstream prices have been falling since mid-2008: even by M a y 2009, as commodity prices had
started to recover, wholesale prices were s t i l l more than 8 percent below their July 2008 peak.

 18.     Indonesia's external position remains sound, though weaker than in 2007. Developments in
global commodity and financial markets buffeted Indonesia's balance o f payments throughout 2008.
The current account recorded a small surplus (USD 0.3 bn) over the full year, much smaller than the
USD 10 bn-plus surpluses o f the previous two years. The bubble in o i l prices in the first half o f 2008
inflated first Indonesia's fuel import bill and then i t s net income deficit as o i l producers transferred
their profits abroad. Portfolio outflows at the end o f 2008 moved the overall balance o f payments into
a deficit o f USD 1.9 billion for the whole year, the first annual deficit since 2001 (Figure 15). The
year-end portfolio outflows were driven by both residents, who shifted USD 2.7 bn into offshore bank
accounts, and non-residents selling down their holdings o f debt securities (net outflow o f USD 3.8 bn
from both corporate and Government securities). These factors turned around in the first quarter o f
2009, with the balance o f payment surplus recording a USD 4.0 bn surplus. The current account
surplus o f USD 1.8 bn reflected a large trade surplus more than offsetting small deteriorations in the
net income deficit and workers' remittances. Non-residents' purchases o f the Government's USD and
IDR bond issuance pushed the capital account into a surplus o f USD 2.4 bn. Other areas o f the capital
accounts were relatively untouched by the turbulence on financial markets, and Indonesia recorded i t s
largest inflows o f foreign direct investment since mid-2005 in the final quarter o f 2008 and the f i r s t

quarters o f 2009.' External loans falling due were generally rolled over (Figure 16). The overall
balance of payments remained in surplus in the second quarter, according to preliminary estimates,
with a wider current account surplus offsetting a capital account deficit o f USD 1.8 bn, and reserves
stabilized above USD 57 bn.

19.      Indonesia's Government i s well-positioned to respond to the downturn. In 2008 the budget
deficit was just 0.1 percent o f GDP, compared with 2.1 percent projected earlier in the year when
international o i l prices and Indonesia's energy subsidies peaked. Revenues were 9.6 percent above
budgeted levels, due to high commodity prices and improvements in tax office administration, while
under-spending continued as it has in recent years. Despite the exchange rate depreciation the debt to
GDP ratio continued i t s secular decline, ending the year near 33 percent. The Government also
recorded a financing surplus o f 1 percent o f GDP, due to i t s lower-than-expected deficit and front-
loaded borrowing strategy. In 2009 the Government has continued this front-loaded strategy o f market
bond issuance, and i t s sales have been benefiting from the falls in yields and willingness to purchase
longer t e r m debt (Table 1). By early August the Government had raised a total IDR 100.7 tr (or about
70 percent) o f i t s IDR 144.1 tr financing target, including USD 3.65 bn o f USD conventional and
sukuk securities and a USD 0.35 bn samurai bond sale (Table 2).

buyers from US, E U and Japan shifting USD 0.65 bn o f orders from China; and Volkswagen, the German

POLICY-MAKERS' RESPONSE TO THE DETERIORATING GLOBAL ECONOMY AND
INDONESIA'S ECONOMIC OUTLOOK
20.      Indonesia's monetary and fiscal policy makers responded quickly to the deteriorating global
economy. Bank Indonesia shifted monetary policy from the anti-inflationary stance o f mid-2008,
cutting interest rates by 300 bps to 6.5 percent between December and August 2009, their lowest level
                                                                       13
under the current monetary policy regime. The Bank has signaled that i t s August rate cut i s likely to
be i t s last, and i t s focus has shifted from supporting activity to monitoring the outlook for inflation in
2010. B I has also reduced the corridor between the interest rate banks receive on deposits at BI and
pay on loans, and, during the peak period o f financial market turbulence, injected liquidity into the
inter-bank lending market.

2 1.     The Government shifted fiscal policy to a more expansionary stance, including a 1.5 percent
stimulus package. In anticipation o f declining revenues and the need for fiscal stimulus, Parliament
approved an accelerated initial revision to the 2009 budget, with a 2.5 percent deficit target and
1.5 percent fiscal stimulus. The revised budget seeks to stimulate demand by expanding Government
spending on infrastructure, and lowering taxes for specific sectors, in addition to the already-
programmed reductions in tax revenues. Given difficulties in programming and lags in spending, the
Government views tax cuts as the fastest and surest means o f short-term stimulus, and their large
share in Indonesia's stimulus package stands out from packages elsewhere. By mid-year, the
Government had spent 34 percent o f i t s budget, slightly better than 2008's 33 percent realization, with
spending higher in all categories apart from subsidies compared with 2008. Domestic revenue reached
IDR 346.7 tr or 40.9 percent o f the full-year target, below the f i r s t half collection o f 43 percent o f
2008 revenue. With the cuts in tax rates, lower commodity prices and compressed trade values, total
first-half revenue was down 18.4 percent on a year earlier.. The excess o f revenues over spending
created an IDR 8.8 tr surplus for the first semester 2009.

 Table 3. Lower oil & gas revenues and energy subsidies have cut the government's share of GDP in 2009,
                           although spending on Government activity is higher

22.     The global downturn, lower global commodity prices, and tighter global financing will lead to
slower Indonesian growth in 2009 and 2010 compared with recent years. The sharp downturn in
global economic activity at the turn o f 2009 combined with the fall in commodity prices imply lower
                                                             14
external demand and reduced incomes in exposed sectors and regions. Domestic demand has also
been slowed by the tightening domestic credit conditions around the turn o f the year and weaker
global outlook into the medium-term, which has reduced investment and purchases o f consumer
durables relative to the peaks o f mid-2008. Together these factors are expected to slow growth to
around 4 to 4.5 percent in 2009, before the gradual recovery in commodity prices from the second
quarter o f 2009 and in the global economy in the second half o f the year pushes growth to around 5.5
percent range in 2010. On the upside, the falls in commodity prices are likely to continue to limit
inflation for some months this year and there i s potential, partly through the judicious use o f monetary
policy, for current l o w inflation expectations to support lower inflation outcomes into the medium
term. In the longer term, growth i s expected to return to potential, which i s based on population
growth, recent investment rates, and Indonesia's improving institutional and investment environment
(Table 4).

23.      Improvements in global credit market conditions suggest Indonesia's considerable external
financing requirements, while s t i l l a source o f macroeconomic risk, are sustainable, and the risk o f
sharp capital outflows had receded by mid-2009 relative to the start o f the year. Scheduled debt
repayments, bond amortizations, and projected current account movements in 2009 sum to a little
under USD 28 bn (Table 5). As noted above, non-residents have returned as net buyers o f ongoing
Indonesian financial assets (e.g. shares or bonds), external debt obligations due in the first half o f the
year have generally been rolled over, while residents' shift o f savings into foreign-currency accounts
appears to have only lasted through the period o f most extreme volatility on global financial markets,
and uncertainty surrounding the size and maturity o f Indonesia's external obligations has declined.
But Indonesia's relatively open capital accounts and historical record mean both remain sources o f
external financing vulnerability. With very conservative assumptions, and given the outcomes o f the
first half o f the year, it appears that any gap between financing needs and inflows through 2009 i s
likely to be small. Nonetheless, while there does not appear to be a significant domestic trigger for
strong capital account outflows, with currency swaps further reducing the risk o f capital flight, there
remains an ongoing, small, but important risk o f large capital outflows, with residents remaining the
largest source o f outflow risk. And this can impact the real economy. Most f i r m s generate financing

                                                                  15
for working capital and investment internally, but o f financing sourced outside the firm, foreign loans
are significant (although these are likely to include intra-company loans), and there i s a preference for
issuing bonds offshore rather than on the domestic market. Anecdotal reports suggest limited use o f
hedging by non-financial f i r m s especially against the foreign exchange risk o f financing obligations,
and there were reports o f pressure on cash flow in some f i r m s when the exchange rate was at i t s lows
late 2008 and in February 2009.

24.     Though the poverty rate did decline from 15.4 percent in March 2008 to 14.2 percent in
March 2009, because o f the growth slowdown, it i s unlikely to fall much further in the year up to
early 2010. The decline in poverty in the year to March 2009 reflected overall economic growth in the
5 to 6percent range, and especially strong results for agriculture, slower growth in food and fuel
prices, and especially the impact o f the Government's 2008-09 cash transfer program to poor and
near-poor households (BLT). With a continued slowing in growth, and the BLT ended in March 2009,
poverty i s unlikely to fall much further by early 2010.

25.      M u c h uncertainty surrounds these projections, to both the down- and up-side. A deeper and
longer than currently projected recession among Indonesia's trading partners, with associated renewed
declines in commodity prices and depreciation o f the rupiah, would lower Indonesia's 2009 and 2010
growth by an additional one-quarter and three-quarters o f one percent to the 4 percent and 4%-to-5
percent range respectively. But there are also upside possibilities, related to domestic and external
factors. For example, Indonesian policy makers could choose to continue with fiscal stimulus package
in 2010 and adopt other measures to support domestic demand for example through improvements in
the investment climate. Further, Indonesian domestic demand and has held up better through the first
half 2009 than most commentators expected, suggesting the pass-through from global events to the
domestic economy not be as great as anticipated, while commodity prices and growth outcomes o f
several significant trading partners have also been above expectations. Plausible above-projection
movements in these variables would add about one-half and three-quarters o f one percentage point to
projected growth in 2009 and 2010 respectively.

26.     Despite the uncertainty, the government's proactive management o f the economy has
provided the requisite stability needed for the continued advancement o f the reform agenda. And the
overall macroeconomic policy framework remains strong enough to warrant continued support for
Indonesia's structural and institutional reforms through DPL-6.

POLITICAL OUTLOOK
27.      As the result o f a sustained decade o f political and institutional reforms, Indonesia in 2009 i s
a highly competitive, decentralized electoral democracy. Governments at national, provincial, district
and city level are elected in free and fair contests, with an incumbent loss rate o f about 40 percent
(one o f the highest o f any competitive democracy). Indonesia has a vibrant political party system,
though ideologies are not strong and candidate selection i s often subject to money politics. A system
o f checks and balances between legislative, judicial, and executive branches i s in place, with no one
branch o f Government able to dominate, and few institutional outcomes `guaranteed'. A vigorous
free media thrives. Where power was once radically concentrated around the presidency, the
executive branch now has to share normal law-making powers with the legislature. Where power was
once concentrated in Jakarta, it i s now shared among 500 odd city, district and provincial
Governments.

28.    Indonesian pride in ensuring high quality, international standard democratic elections since
1999 was blunted by poorly managed 2009 national legislative elections. The central problem was
incomplete and inaccurate voter lists, resulting in millions o f eligible voters not being able to cast


                                                    16
ballots in the April Legislative Election Day, with the Supreme Court intervening at the last moment
to allow voter registration on site in the July Presidential contest.

29.      In the Legislative Election, data collected from civil society observers and party and candidate
poll witnesses illustrated the problems, showing a significantly larger number o f polling stations and
electoral districts reporting logistical problems, incomplete or inaccurate voter lists, and intimidation
or interference by party or candidate observers. In the complicated legislative election, eighty percent
o f polling places were reported to not have been fully equipped with all mandatory materials (proper
ballot boxes, correct ballot papers, clear instructions, finger ink, and tabulation forms).

30.      Despite these outcomes the overall assessment o f the legislative elections was that the
election was not compromised in any meaningful, outcome-altering ways at the national level.
Election observers noted that while the election process was badly managed by the National Election
Commission, there was no systematic disenfranchisement o f specific groups o f potential voters.
Throughout Indonesia, observers witnessed how local officials and communities wrote out clear
instructions for voters, where they improvised secret polling booths, and where local communities
closely watched and monitored the process. This degree o f social control - massive nation-wide "buy-
in" and "guaranteeing o f ' the election process cannot be overestimated and was a major factor in the
overall success o f both this election, and previous elections, in Indonesia.

3 1.    In the legislative contest there was a striking tripling o f President Yudhoyono's Democrat
Party (PD) 2004 vote, the continuing decline o f the Soeharto-era "legacy parties" and poor results by
Islamic parties. Quite dramatic was the plunge for Golkar to about 14.5 percent (down from about 22
percent in 2004) and the continuing slide in support for former President Megawati's Indonesian
Democratic Party o f Struggle (PDIP) to about 14 percent also (down from 18.5 percent in 2004). The
continuing (and growing) appeal o f mainstream, more-or-less secular-nationalist parties, with fully 75
percent o f the vote going to such parties, i s one o f the overall take-aways o f the legislative election.

32.      The July 8 presidential election in Indonesia proceeded smoothly and peacefully. Government
and civil society organizations report relatively few problems in the voting and tabulation. The
National Election Commission's (KPU) voter lists, more accurate than in the A p r i l legislative
election, combined with a Constitutional Court ruling that helped unregistered voters to cast ballots,
significantly reduced the number o f citizens who may have otherwise not been allowed to vote.
Approximately 72 percent o f 176 million registered voters cast ballots in over 450,000 polling
stations.

33.      On July 25th the KPU officially declared the incumbent President Susilo Bambang
Yudhoyono (SBY) and former Bank Indonesia Governor Boediono as winners o f the presidential
election with 60.80 percent o f the votes. In addition, SBY and his vice presidential running mate, won
over 50 percent o f the vote in at least 28 o f the 33 provinces. SBY's victory appears to be not only
nation-wide in scope, but equally strong among almost all income, gender, ethnic and religious
groups. According to post-elections reports the major post election shifts are likely to be: efforts by
SBY to reduce the number o f party-held cabinet seats; and efforts to boost the strength o f the office o f
the President vis-&vis parliament and parties. SBY's Boediono pick vindicates the President's
inclination to choose technocrats and professionals over party figures.

34.        The centrist, pragmatic, conservative approach o f most mainstream politicians has been
responsible for the best aspects o f Indonesian development in the past decade - the sensible, steady,
generally peaceful democratic consolidation and decentralization o f authorities - but this approach
may also slow or blunt some o f the economic reform measures that are widely agreed as necessary. It
i s this Indonesian political preference for wide buy-in and moderation that has blunted the growth o f
any radical parties or allowed overly nationalistkhauvinist appeals to gain traction publically.
                                                    17
However, it i s also this conservative, `don't-rock-the-boat, we can work with anybody' approach to
politics that has slowed or blunted further some o f the economic reform measures or major
infrastructure improvements needed.

           1.
          11     THE GOVERNMENT'S INFRASTRUCTURE REFORM PROGRAM

35.     The priority assigned to infrastructure was emphasized soon after the Government's election,
with a f i r s t Infrastructure Summit in January 2005. The Government's ongoing commitment was
publicly communicated in a further Infrastructure Summit (February 2006), and an Infrastructure
Forum (April 2009). Two infrastructure "policy packages" (Inpres 6/2007 and Inpres 5/2008) have
been issued, setting out hundreds o f policy reforms to be undertaken during 2005-2009, and the
Government has moved steadily to implement this program. Budget allocations for infrastructure
have more than doubled (in nominal terms) since 2005 (Figure 17). The Government has also made
progress in a program o f infrastructure public-private partnerships, including establishing a supportive
regulatory and institutional framework, with some initial transactions now coming to fruition.

                           Figure 17. Infrastructure Budget Allocations

Includes APBN allocations for the Ministries of: Public Works; Transportation; Energy and Mineral
Resources; Communication and Information; and Public Housing.

36.      In response to the international financial crisis, the Government prepared a Rp. 73.3 trillion
(US$ 7 billion) fiscal stimulus package in March 2009, o f which Rp. 12.2 trillion i s allocated for
infrastructure spending. The stimulus package i s intended to be timely, temporary, and targeted.
Infrastructure projects from the Government's existing program (set out in Inpres 5/2008) have been
identified for increased allocations in 2009. Selection criteria for inclusion in the stimulus package
included the capacity to create jobs, as well as readiness criteria such as the existence o f detailed
engineering designs, multi-year projects which can be accelerated, and projects for which any
necessary land i s already acquired. The targeting element o f the infrastructure stimulus package i s
achieved by selecting projects in poorer regions o f Indonesia.

37.    The Government i s currently preparing i t s medium-term plan for 2010-2014, and this i s
expected to maintain a strong emphasis on infrastructure. At the April 2009 Infrastructure Forum, the
Coordinating Minister for Economic Affairs highlighted some o f the Government's targets, including:
    0  providing an additional 10 million piped water household connections, increasing coverage to
       70-80% in urban areas and 40-50% in rural areas by 20 15;
       constructing 1000 km o f toll roads and improving the national roads in Sumatra, Kalimantan
       and Sulawesi;
    0  building new airports and continuing rehabilitation program for existing airports;
    0  improving telecommunications access for rural areas;
    0  developing double track railways in parts o f Java; and developing commuter railways in
       several large cities;
                                                  19

                    1
          in phase 1 ; and
      0   expanding multi-storey housing to address the housing backlog.



ELECTRICITY
38.     The Government has placed high priority on encouraging investment in the electricity sector
in recent years. Nevertheless, there i s a long lead time in contracting and construction, and it will not
be until at least 2010 that substantial new capacity will be brought on line to address power shortages
that have arisen from several previous years o f inadequate investment.

39.      With electricity demand growing at over 6% per year over the past decade, and very little
system expansion over the past decade, the system now has an inadequate reserve margin. Blackouts
are occurring across the country. PLN has installed capacity o f 29,705 MW, and private businesses
have their own "captive" capacity o f around 15,000 M W . Even as the economy slows down,
electricity demand i s predicted to grow at 6.2% over the next two years.

40.     Since early 2006, the Government has been pursuing a "crash" program to procure 10,000
M W (now reduced to 8,721MW) o f coal-fired power plants to be operated by PLN. Table 6 sets out
the financing status for the program as a whole. O f the $4.3 billion needed for investment in new
generation capacity in 2009-10, $3.0 billion o f financing has been secured. Around 3,600 M W o f
capacity i s expected to be commissioned by the end o f 2010. In addition to the public crash program,
PLN has been pursuing private investment in electricity, with IPPs expected to make an increasing
contribution to capacity after 2012. A second 10,000 M W program i s envisaged, including 30-40%
renewable energy sources.




                                                   20
41.      Securing the remaining financing will be challenging. Local banks are approaching their
sector limits, unless explicit Government guarantees are given. Foreign banks have increased their
interest rates for IPPs by 50-100 bps, reduced their project lending limits from $100 million to $50
million per project, and are concentrating on the best prepared international projects.

42.      Even without the global financial crisis, the task o f raising finance for the sector was
complicated by the fact that electricity tariffs have not been increased since 2003, when the average
tariff was brought to the pre-crisis level o f 6.8 cents/kWh. Because o f the significance o f o i l in PLN's
fuel mix; during much o f 2008 the fuel cost alone exceeded the average tariff. T o ensure PLN's
financial sustainability the Government provides a "Public Service Obligation" (PSO) subsidy, which
covers the difference between PLN's costs and the regulated tariffs for different consumer categories.

43.       PLN's PSO amounted to Rp. 37 trillion (US$ 4.2 billion) in 2007. With high fuel prices
during 2008, the cost increased to Rp. 79 trillion in 2008. With lower o i l prices and reduced
dependence on o i l as new coal power plants come on line, the electricity subsidy cost i s projected to
fall to Rp. 55 trillion in 2009 and Rp. 42 trillion in 2010. With much political capital used in reducing
o i l subidies, the Government has indicated that it would not increase electricity tariffs prior to the
2009 election.

44.      In 2008, the Government reorganized P L N and appointed a new Board o f Directors. One o f
the changes was to re-establish a planning unit, which i s helping to improve the orderly development
o f investment projects and assist the government in forecasting the fiscal burden o f PLN's subsidies.
The planning unit was fragmented in preparation for reforms that would have moved Indonesia to an
unbundled competitive market. These reforms were disallowed by the Constitutional Court in 2004, a
result which disrupted reform momentum and i s the root cause o f many o f the sector's current
problems.

45.     Another element o f the recent restructuring i s a move to regional business units. PLN's costs
vary widely by region, and it i s anticipated that this restructuring will facilitate the development o f
responses to region-specific problems. The House o f Representatives i s currently considering a
proposed law which would permit regionally differentiated tariffs, with differing levels o f subsidies
across different regions.

ROADS
46.       The first priority in any road network i s maintenance o f the existing network. In 2006, the
national road network o f 34,628 km included 81% in good or fair condition, 10% in poor condition,
and 9% in bad condition. The Ministry o f Public Works' Directorate General o f Highways aims to
have no roads left in poor or bad condition by 2010, an objective which will be largely determined by
budget availability. T o provide a more systematic link between funding and sectoral performance
targets, the Government i s working towards a medium-term expenditure framework and performance
based budgeting. The Ministry o f Public Works i s acting as one o f six pilot ministries for these
initiatives.

47.     Amendments to the Traffic and Road Transport Policy L a w made in 2009 provide for the
establishment o f a Road Fund. But the finance sources for this fund have yet to be determined, so
development o f the necessary implementingregulations may be a lengthy process.

48.    An important national priority i s the development o f an expressways network, including toll-
roads. Development o f an expressway network would provide an important boost to economic

                                                    21
growth. The National Road Network Master Plan calls for the creation o f 2,885 km o f toll-road
expressways. Almost 700 km o f expressways already exist, although most o f these were constructed
prior to the 1997 financial crisis.

49.     The Government i s seeking private investment to expand the toll-roads network. The
Indonesian Toll Road Authority, BPJT, was established in 2005 with regulatory powers and the
responsibility to prepare projects for private investment. Concession agreements have been signed for
805 km in 22 sections o f toll-roads. Fourteen o f these agreements were signed prior to 1997, and
because o f difficulties in land acquisition have languished, unable to achieve financial close. In
recent years, the Government has taken measures to address the land acquisition problems and to
terminate projects which are s t i l l unable to achieve financial close. The Government has also
tendered several new "batches" o f toll-roads in recent years, and these are in various stages o f
preparation.

50.       Institutional capacity in the road sector needs enhancement. Heavy vehicle overloading i s
prevalent, and road safety i s poor. Road works are often expensive and low quality. The World Bank
i s assisting the Ministry o f Public Works and Ministry o f Transport with a pilot road safety program,
and pilot testing performance-basedcontracts for road maintenance, including vehicle loading control.

PIPED WATER
51.    In recent times, the national Government has recognized the important contribution it can
make to the sector's performance, notwithstanding that service provision i s the responsibility o f local
governments. Elements o f an overall strategy are emerging, but sectoral reform i s s t i l l at an early
stage.

52.      In late 2008, the Vice President announced that the Government would seek to provide an
extra 10 million household piped water connections over five years. This would roughly double the
number o f people with access to piped water, and would cost in the order o f US$ 8 billion. The goal
i s ambitious, particularly when contrasted with the low levels of investment over the previous decade.
The goal can be criticized for not addressing the need to improve commercial operations in order to
deliver water through the new connections, or for not addressing the need to improve bulk water
supply. Nevertheless, this announcement has focused the attention o f the national government on a
clear target, and has given rise to several new schemes intended to assist with the objective.

Sectoral Background

53.     Approximately 18% o f the population, or about 40 million people, currently have access to
piped water. In 200 1 responsibility for water services was decentralized to sub-national government.
"Big Bang" decentralization o f funding and responsibilities exceeded local governments' expenditure
capacities. Water sector investment declined from an average o f US$ 400 million in the 1990s to
under U S $ 45 million in 2005, about one tenth o f what i s needed to achieve the 2015 Millenium
Development Goals. The sector's problems include:

   0   low service coverage;
   0   debt arrears o f PDAMs and their owning local governments, which effectively act as legal
       barriers to new borrowing (which i s needed to fund new investment);
   0   absence o f long-term finance for the sector on terms which are consistent with affordable
       tariffs;
   0   poor financial performance o f PDAMs, including low tariffs and low collection rates, resulting
       in low credit-worthiness;


                                                  22
       weak capacity in local financial institutions to appraise the credit-worthiness o f local
       governments and PDAMs.
       concerns about the incentives and capacity o f some local governments which see PDAMs as
       cash sources, rather than as investment destinations with the purpose o f improving services for
       their residents;
       poor governance o f PDAMs, which has permitted some local governments to take "dividends"
       from even loss-making enterprises;
       l o w technical capacity and performance in most PDAMs;
       excessive fragmentation o f PDAMs, hindering the realization o f economies o f scale and
       sharing o f scarce management skills;
       reluctance by some local governments to undertake significant investments, in some cases
       because o f concerns that competitive tenders could expose them to personal liability in the
       event o f misprocurement.
       weak performance monitoring and reporting in the sector.

Debt Restructuring

54.     In 2008, the Ministry o f Finance moved to address a long-standing obstacle to the flow o f
finance into the sector. Ministry o f Finance regulations prohibit new borrowing by PDAMs if they or
their owning governments (PEMDA) have arrears on debt on-lent by the central Government. Even
though the amounts o f debt arrears are often relatively small, these regulations have operated as a
legal obstacle to new borrowing by PDAMs that cover a large proportion o f the country's population
(see Table 7).


                     Table 7 Population in PDAM areas by arrears level, 2004




55.      Ministry o f Finance Regulations No. 120/2008 and 153/2008 set out a scheme o f debt
restructuring for PDAMs and local governments, aimed at eliminating debt arrears (see B o x 1). The
program i s accompanied by new regulations which permit the Ministry o f Finance to intercept fiscal
transfers to local government, in the event that arrears recur. O f the 170 PDAMs with arrears, 70
have submitted applications for debt-restructuring, o f which 16 have been approved. The Ministry o f
Public Works i s providing technical assistance to PDAMs to help them to prepare the business plans
which are a pre-condition for entering into the debt restructuring program.

56.     The Ministry o f Public Works has also introduced a scheme intended to provide incentives to
"healthy" PDAMs that are not in need o f debt restructuring, to provide household connections. A
budget o f Rp. 207 billion ($20 million) i s available during 2009, and grants o f Rp. 1 million ($97) are
available for each new piped water connection.




                                                   23
                     Box 1 PDAM Debt RestructuringUnder P M K 120/2008

Applications for PDAM debt restructuring must include:
        the previous year's audited accounts;
        the past year's work plan and budget;
        a forward 5-year business plan prepared by the PDAM and endorsed by the relevant mayor.
        a statement by the relevant mayor o f willingness to support the PDAM in i t s financial
        restructuring.

Criteria for acceptance into the scheme include:
         tariffs higher than basic costs (as specified in Ministry o f Home Affairs Regulation 23/2006).
         appointment o f a Board o f Directors subject to a "fit and proper" test, conducted by the
         relevant mayor.

The business plan must set out the proposed debt restructuring schedule, and must also specify targets
and corrective actions for tariff increases, water loss levels, service coverage, employee numbers per
1000 customers, days o f outstanding debt, loss, investment, and total debt. The business plan i s
approved and monitored by a Committee including representatives from the Ministry o f Finance,
Public Works, Home Affairs, Bappenas, and the State Audit Agency.

Debt restructuring applies to arrears on interest, as well as any other fees imposed as a result o f a
PDAM being in arrears. Debt forgiveness o f 40%, 50% or 60% i s provided where the relevant local
government has high, medium, or low fiscal capacity. The remaining amounts o f the arrears must be
converted into investments in the PDAM.

Incentive Grantsfor Sub-National Governments

57.     Direct responsibility for improving PDAM performance rests with local governments. While
the Ministry o f Public Works has a history o f involvement in the piped water sector, and i s
maintaining i t s involvement in funding and technical supervision o f some projects, ultimately the
technical and financial capacity to deliver piped water services will need to be developed at the
subnational level.

58.     The Ministry o f Finance and Ministry o f Public Works have developed an output-based grant
scheme which will provide grants to sub-national governments whose PDAMs provide new piped
water connections to poor households. This scheme provides incentives to sub-national governments
to work towards national goals, while leaving the onus on the sub-national governments to determine
how best to achieve those goals.

59.    Elements o f the scheme include:

       Grants ("hibah") will be provided to the governments after connections for poor households
       have been installed and operated for 3 months.
       The grants will be between Rp. 2 million ($175) and Rp. 4 million (about a quarter o f the
       estimated cost) per connection depending on the targeted number o f connections, and a
       maximum o f Rp. 20 billion per district during 2010-2014.
       Participation in the scheme will be subject to an application by the local government.
       Approvals for participation in the scheme will be subject to an overall budget cap which i s
       currently envisaged at a level corresponding to 1.5 million new connections over 5 years.


                                                  24
60.      This scheme i s a promising development on several fronts. The planned level o f finance will
make a significant contribution towards the goal o f expanding service coverage. By focusing on
desired outputs, it provides incentives to overcome a range o f problems arising in different PDAMs.
By focusing on the sub-national governments rather than the PDAMs, it provides incentives to the
entities with the power to address some o f the most important governance issues in the sector. And
the scheme provides incentives to local governments to improve capacity, with the Ministry o f Public
Works playing an appropriate verification role rather than i t s traditional implementation role.

Financingfor the Water Sector

61.    In order to encourage local bank finance to flow into the sector, a new Presidential Regulation
29/2009 has been issued which provides for a government guarantee o f 70% o f funds borrowed by
PDAMs from local banks, as well as interest rate subsidies for the loans.

62.     Elements o f the scheme include:
        T o be eligible to participate, a P D A M must: be in the debt restructuring program or not have
        arrears to the Ministry o f Finance; must have a full cost recovery tariff; and must have a
        BPKF' audit indicating that it i s in "healthy" condition.
        The government will pay interest subsidies on the loan equal to the difference between the
        interest rate on the loan and the Bank o f Indonesia rate, up to a maximum o f 5% and subject
        to an overall budget limit.
        The central government will guarantee 70% o f a commercial loan taken out by the PDAM,
        but in the event o f default will have recourse for 40% o f the loan against the owning local
        government, and for the whole o f the loan against the PDAM. The local government's
        obligation will be recorded as a debt to the central government, and will be secured by an
        intercept over general fiscal transfers (DAU and DAK).
        The loan must be appraised following technical criteria established b y the Ministry o f Public
        Works.
        The P D A M will pass all i t s revenue through a nominated bank account, and must give the
        lending bank the authority to deduct funds from the bank account in the event that the P D A M
        defaults.

63.     The scheme has the virtue o f leveraging additional finance into the sector, and almost all
countries subsidize their piped water systems to some degree. Nevertheless, the scheme has several
weaknesses:
        It i s possible that the scheme will not induce large levels o f investment. There are many
        restrictions in the scheme which may impede the scheme's adoption by PDAMs and local
        governments. Even bearing just 30% o f the risk, local banks may be wary o f lending to
        PDAMs.
        If there i s a large take-up o f the scheme, and the available budget expands over time, the
        guarantees may expose the Government to high fiscal risks. Local banks, including
        development banks owned by regional governments, may not have strong capacity to appraise
        accurately the riskiness o f loans to PDAM, and the risks that they take will be passed on to
        Government.
        Commercial bank lending involves higher interest rates than can be obtained by governments
        (through bonds or from donors), and i s currently short term. A financing scheme focused on
        affordability would seek first to take advantage o f alternative finance sources with lower
        interest rates and longer tenor.
        The scheme i s not targeted to particular classes o f investments or particular policy objectives.
        Government might, for example, prefer to prioritize investments which expand access for
        poor people.
                                                   25
PUBLIC-PRIVATE PARTNERSHIPS
64.     The Government i s pursuing PPP transactions in all infrastructure sectors, including toll
roads, power plants, natural gas pipelines, rail, ports, bulk water plants, airports, and
telecommunications projects. Modest results are beginning to show. Some short sections o f toll-
roads and small bulk water treatment plants have commenced operation. Construction has
commenced on over U S $ 2 billion o f new PPP projects, including power plants, toll-roads, and water
treatment plants.

65.     Slow progress has generally been the result o f poor project preparation, with inadequate
background analysis undertaken prior to tendering, resulting in unrealistic expectations by tendering
agencies. Learning from past errors, the Government has begun to strengthen the project preparation
process, and i s placing greater reliance on external advisers. An electricity plant in central Java i s
being prepared with the assistance o f an IFC advisory mandate, with bidding (ie RFP) expected to be
launched in September. The ADB has mobilized a PPP project development facility, funded by a U S $
26.5 million loan, and a U S $ 7.56 million grant provided by the Netherlands. The facility i s currently
providing support to 20 national and sub-national PPP projects, including toll-roads, ferry terminals,
bulk water supply systems, railways, an airport, and a telecommunications project. The emphasis o f
current support i s on improving the quality o f feasibility studies prior to bidding.

66.      The Ministry o f Finance may currently authorize guarantees or direct financial support only
for PPPs which comply with Perpres 67, which requires three bids received in a competitive tendering
process. Given the infancy o f Indonesia's PPP program, the requirement o f three bids has proven to be
a practical barrier to projects for which government support may be economically justified. Revisions
to Perpres 67 are being prepared which would authorize negotiations with successful bidders in cases
where fewer than three bids are received. This would open the way for the provision o f Government
support to a wider range o f transactions. The revisions being proposed would also extend Perpres 67
to projects o f sub-national governments. The draft revisions have passed through a process o f review
at officials' level, and have now been circulated for final Ministerial approval before Presidential
signature.

67.       Finally, the Government i s developing institutions to support infrastructure financing. The
Indonesia Infrastructure Financing Facility (IIFF) will mobilize funds to provide the long-term local
currency debt that i s desirable for PPP projects and provide commercially focused technical advice in
the preparation o f infrastructure PPPs. The IIFF will be operated as a private non-bank financial
institution, with a mandate to provide long-term finance and technical expertise to support increased
private investment in infrastructure. The initial capital raising for the IIFF has been completed, and it
i s expected to be established as an operating company by the end o f 2009.

68.      A Guarantee Fund i s being prepared to ensure the availability o f government funds to honor
guarantees given to private infrastructure projects. The amount o f money available in the fund will
cap the level o f contingent liabilities the Government may assume. Government Regulation 3 5/2009
provides for the establishment o f the Fund with a capital base o f $100 million. It i s envisaged that
these modest funds will be used to focus on pre-construction start risks associated with government
actions, such as allocation o f land and issuance o f permits and licenses. The World Bank i s assisting
the Ministry o f Finance Risk Management Unit in the design o f the Guarantee Fund, and has also
been requested to provide a $100 million guarantee or loan to expand the potential operations o f the
Guarantee Fund.

LAND ACQUISITION
69.     Acquisition o f land for public purposes i s a frequent source o f delays in infrastructure
projects. Over the past year, the Government has moved to implement regulations that were adopted
                                                  26
in 2007 by the National Land Agency (BPN Regulation 3/2007, pursuant to Perpres 65/2006).
Among other matters, the new regulation provides that land acquisition committees (which are
appointed by local governments) should use independent appraisals o f market valuation o f land, rather
than using the assessed taxation value (which i s typically below market value) as the basis o f
negotiations for land acquisition. The regulation specifies a mechanism by which land acquisition for
a particular development can proceed once agreement on compensation i s reached in respect o f 75%
o f the required land area, or if 75% o f affected landowners have agreed to the level o f compensation.
For any remaining land that i s in dispute after 120 days, the assessed market value can be "consigned"
to the District Court, where it i s held while the court resolves the outstanding disputes over the level
o f compensation. In the meantime, construction can proceed.

70.     A Land Working Group was also established in 2007, with the aim o f identifying additional
measures to improve the procedures. The Working Group i s chaired by the Head o f the National Land
Agency (BPN), and includes members drawn from the Coordinating Ministry o f Economic Affairs,
BAPPENAS, Ministry o f Public Works, and the Ministry o f Home Affairs. In 2008 the Working
Group prepared an action plan, which has largely been implemented during 2009. A large part o f the
action plan involves implementation and "socialization" o f the new regulation 3/2007, including
through preparation o f technical guidelines and training sessions with local governments.

71.     The Government has now successfully implementedthe new procedures on several occasions,
including the consigning o f funds to a court while remaining disputes are addressed. It appears that
the new process i s successful in accelerating land acquisition. B P N has also taken measures to expand
the areas o f operation o f licensed independent land appraisal firms, to facilitate greater use o f their
services. B P N has also given high priority to the route o f the proposed trans-Java expressway, having
completed all surveying along i t s proposed route, and giving priority to the valuation o f sections for
which investment i s most likely to proceed.

72.     The Government i s also taking measures to address the financing o f land acquisition, which
has been a major blockage to toll-road development. A revolving land fund was established by the
Ministry o f Public Works in January 2007. The fund finances land acquisition for toll-roads, and i s
reimbursed by the concessionaire when land acquisition i s completed. The Ministry currently faces
excess demand for the facility, which currently has Rp. 1.4 trillion. For a group o f toll-road
concession contracts that were signed prior to 1997 but which have not yet moved to financial close,
the Government has also established a Rp. 4.9 trillion "land-capping" fund. This limits the payments
to be made by concessionaires for land acquisition to 1 10% o f the costs initially envisaged (calculated
by reference to the project's internal rate o f return). As o f February 2009, the land acquired for the
654 km trans-Java toll-roads constituted 15% o f the total land that will eventually be required.

MANAGING ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACTS
73.      The Government's annual work plan includes the environmental actions to be addressed in
each budget cycle. Some o f the items mentioned include development o f debt for nature swaps,
reducing environmental pollution, reducing smoke and haze from forest and land fires, rehabilitation
o f forests and degraded lands, conservation o f natural resources, improving environmental
management through the spatial planning process, and developing environmental data and
information. Within this program, the initiatives most relevant for purposes o f the I D P L program are
initiatives to improve solid waste management and to improve environmental impact assessment and
management.

74.     The new Municipal Waste Management Law, enacted in early 2008, aims to reduce the
generation o f solid waste by encouraging communities to "reduce, reuse, recycle", and also aims to
improve the handling o f solid waste, through improved separation o f types o f waste and processing

                                                   27
prior to final treatment. Only about 50% o f Indonesia's solid waste i s actually collected, 1520% i s
properly disposed, and less than 2% i s treated (recycled or composted). About 85% o f small cities
and more than 50% o f medium cities dispose of their waste in open dumps. The Government i s
currently preparing regulations needed to implement the law, in the areas o f solid waste reduction,
solid waste handling, and specialhndustrialwaste. The regulations are expected to be approved by the
end of 2009.

75.     Indonesia has decentralized responsibility for environmental impact assessment, known in
Indonesia as AMDAL. All 33 provincial governments and 55% o f kabupatenkota governments have
AMDAL agencies. The Ministry of Environment has undertaken two surveys o f the quality o f
environmentalassessments performed by these agencies. While quality i s improving, the most recent
survey s t i l l found that 21% of assessments were poor quality. The Ministry i s undertaking measures
to improve the quality o f the work performed by these agencies, including through the licensing o f
AMDAL commissions, the certification o f commission members and trainers, and the establishment
o f an AMDAL training center.

76.      The Government has prepared proposed revisions to the Environment Law, which would
among other matters impose sanctions for non-compliance with the AMDAL process and strengthen
public consultation. Parliament i s now debating the proposed revisions, and it i s expected that the
revised law will be approved by the current Parliament.



MINISTRY OF PUBLIC WORKS GOVERNANCE ISSUES
77.    The Ministry of Public Works (MPW) accounts for a considerable part of the national
government's public infrastructure investment program, including U S $ 2 billion per year delivered
through the Directorate General of Highways. Measures to improve governance in MPW include
improvements along the length o f the project cycle from planning and design through payments and
audit.

78.     Planning and contracting form: The Government i s moving towards a Medium Term
Expenditure Framework, with MPW one of four government agencies selected to pilot the reforms.
The reforms will help, among other matters, to improve and guarantee the level of resources dedicated
to maintenance. In addition, the government i s planning to pilot performance-based contracting for
maintenance, which should improve the efficiency of the maintenance process.

79.     Oversight: The Government i s piloting a system o f contract oversight that relies on
contracted engineering firms acting as responsible agents rather than in an advisory capacity. In the
new arrangements, the engineer specified in FIDIC contracts as the overseer i s clearly specified by
MPW to be the contracted engineering firm, rather than MPW officials. The system provides
considerably greater authority and responsibility for successful project delivery to the engineering
firm.

80.      Transparency and Disclosure: The Ministry o f Public Works website (www.pu.rro.id)
provides a high standard of information disclosure, exceeding the information availability of most
public works ministries in developing countries. The website includes the Ministry's budget, planned
roads and other works, the results of all tenders including winners and losers and bid prices, audit
reports, and the quarterly financial reports for a l l World Bank projects (the last i s not required by the
World Bank).




                                                    28
8 1.    Procurement: One international benchmark suggests general levels of integrity and
transparency in public procurement in Indonesia are comparatively strong,2 but this contrasts with
Transparency International's assessment o f general levels o f corruption, which ranks Indonesia as
 126' of 180 countries in 2008 (an improvement from 143'd o f 179 countries in 2007). Certainly a
number of issues and potential problems remain - many o f which are being addressed by MPW. In
particular, collusion remains a significant problem in road projects in Indonesia, affecting recent
donor-funded projects. Not least for this reason, the MPW has moved to strengthen procurement
systems and procurement support.

82.      To support the procurement process, MPW has introduced an advanced e-procurement
system. The system handled 4,000 contracts last year. It currently allows publication o f
advertisements o f projects, availability o f bidding documents on line for free download, online
clarifications and queries and notification of contract awards on line. All DGH national roads
contracts in a l l regions and a l l value o f contracts are processed through the system. To date MPW has
been constrained in allowing submission o f bids on-line due to the lack of digital signature legislation.
However this has been recently enacted and DGH intends to full e-procurement once supporting
regulations are put in place. A team from MIT i s currently analyzing the impact o f the move to e-
procurement. Early indications are that the change has resulted in a significant increase in the number
of people obtaining bidding documents, but it i s less clear that there has been a significant increase in
the number of bids made.

83.     To support the multitude of procurement committees in MPW and improve quality and
promptness of their reviews DGH i s establishing an Advisory Team in DGH staffed, funded and
mandated to provide support to DGH tender committees. The Advisory Team i s responsible for
providing guidance and advice to tender committees, evaluating problematic procurement procedures
and providing recommendations for improvement consistent with existing regulations, and
disseminatinginformation on the use o f Government standard bidding documents.

84.      The Directorate General for Construction and Human Resources Development (BPK-SDM),
i s responsible for developing procurement policies that apply across the ministry. AusAID and BPK-
SDM have agreed to terms o f reference for a scoping study that i s intended to identify issues, and
propose an action plan for strengthening the unit. The study i s expected to commence in July and run
for several months.

85.     Audit: The MPW Inspector General (IG) has a broad set of priorities set by management
covering the minimization of leakage, improved quality o f public works and support for good practice
in project management. The IG has recognized the need to move towards systematic risk assessment,
develop a manual for technical audits and expand training, and has developed an action plan for
reform (Table 8). Implementation of the action plan i s behind schedule. AusAID and the World Bank
are working together to provide technical assistance in the implementation o f the reform action plan,
and consultants have recently been mobilized to provide this support.

                 IV.   BANK SUPPORT TO THE GOVERNMENT'S STRATEGY

LINK TO THE INDONESIA COUNTRY PARTNERSHIP STRATEGY
86.      The Country Partnership Strategy (CPS), "Investing in Indonesia's Institutions", was
approved by the Board in September 2008. It covers the period FY09-FY 12. I t recognizes Indonesia's
emergence as a more confident middle-income country and repositions the World Bank's modest but
strategic partnership role in supporting a country-led development strategy and the Government's own
core programs and policies. Continuing and deepening the long-standing focus o f the Indonesia
program on governance, the strategy recognizes that more effective public institutions are the key to
better development outcomes in the future.

87.       The IDPL series addresses five o f the seven core areas o f engagement set out in the CPS:

      0   The CPS aims to support central government systems to enhance public financial management
          and governance. The IDPL series addresses procurement processes in the Ministry o f Public
          Works;
      0   The CPS aims to strengthen decentralized local governments and institutions to increase the
          impact o f public spending. The IDPL series seeks the development o f an incentive
          framework to improve water and sanitation.
      0   The CPS aims to enhance the environment for private sector development. The IDPL series
          embraces a range o f measures intended to promote infrastructure PPPs.
      0   The CPS aims to increase the level and efficiency o f public and private investment in
          infrastructure. All o f the measures o f the IDPL series share this goal.
      0   The CPS aims to strengthen Indonesia's capacity to address environmental challenges. The
          IDPL series seeks improved solid waste management and improvement in environmental
          impact assessment.

88.     The CPS envisages a flexible World Bank Group country financing envelope, potentially
varying significantly up or down around a notional annual IBRD investment of about US$ 2 billion.
The amount o f policy lending in any year i s driven by the extent o f policy reform undertaken. In
FY10, the proposed policy loan amounts are US$ 750 million for DPL 6 and U S $ 250 million for
IDPL 3.



COLLABORATION WITH OTHER DEVELOPMENT PARTNERS
89.     In assessing Indonesia's suitability for policy lending, the IMF and the World Bank in
Indonesia consult regularly on macro-economic and sectoral issues. The Bank coordinates closely
with the Fund in i t s regular post-program monitoring and Article IV missions. In addition, the Bank,
the Fund and development partners have worked closely on the Public Financial Management (PFM)
agenda. The separate macroeconomic DPL series provides a platform to push the reform agenda in
areas where both institutions are working.

90.      The World Bank, the ADB, and the Government o f Japan are a l l supporting the Government's
infrastructure reform program, and there i s close coordination between all three development partners.
The ADB and Japan have a separate but related series o f policy loans, focused on a large subset o f the
Government's reforms. The reforms being recognized by the Bank's IDPL series are a smaller subset
of the Government's reforms, focused on areas o f high priority to the Government, and where the
Bank i s closely involved in dialogue with the Government.



                                                    31
91.     The "Infrastructure Reform Sector Development Program" (IRSDP) i s a cluster o f three
policy-based sub-program loans, supported by the ADB and the Government o f Japan. The ADB's
planned loan timing i s November 2006, November 2008, and November 2010. The Government o f
Japan's loans follow the ADB's loans with a delay o f a few months. The World Bank was closely
involved in preparation o f the IRSDP.

92.     The IRSDP policy matrix i s set out at Annex 3 . Cross-references to items in the IRSDP policy
matrix are included in the I D P L policy matrix at Annex 9, to indicate the overlap and mutually
supportive nature o f the two programs. The IRSDP program i s organized into three themes:
        Cross-sectoral reforms, including the institutional and policy framework for private-sector
        participation, measures to mobilize long-term finance for infrastructure, and the delineation o f
        responsibilities o f national and local governments in infrastructure provision;
        Sector-specific reforms in roads, ports, airports, railways, electricity, o i l and gas, water supply
        and sanitation, and telecommunications, addressing sector planning, cost recovery,
        competition, independent regulation, market access and prevention o f misuse o f market
        power, and reform o f subsidy policies.
        Facilitation o f preparation and execution o f well-structured PPP transactions.

93.     The ADB's f i r s t two IRSDP loans were for U S $ 400 million and $280 million respectively.
The Government o f Japan has adopted the ADB's policy matrix and has provided parallel policy loans
in March 2007, and February 2009, each for US$ 100 million. The ADB i s not providing a loan in
2009 to coincide with the World Bank's I D P L 3 ; nor will Japan. Both the Government and the ADB
are content with the planned timing o f the IRSDP operations. There i s regular dialogue between the
Bank, the ADB, and the Government o f Japan to ensure consistency o f policy messages.



RELATIONSHIP TO OTHER BANK OPERATIONS
94.     The I D P L series i s complemented by existing and proposed World Bank Group infrastructure
operations which, in addition to expanding infrastructure networks and promoting household access to
services, address high priority sector-specific institutional issues.

95.       Historically the Bank played an important role in the energy sector, but pulled back
substantially in the aftermath o f the Suharto era. More recently, significant effort has been made to re-
establish a strong engagement in the sector, with a particular emphasis on renewable energy. The
current portfolio includes the Java-Bali Power Sector Restructuring and Strengthening Project,
helping PLN to improve efficiency and reliability, and the Domestic Gas Markets Development
Project, helping to expand natural gas as an alternative to coal. Projects currently being prepared
include additional finance for the Java-Bali project, and a loan for hydro-electric development on the
Upper Cisokan River. An electricity transmission investment project and a geothermal renewable
energy development project are also envisaged. W h i l e the I D P L engages with high level policy
makers on issues o f the overall level o f tariffs and subsidies, the engagement obtained at the project
level i s fundamental to the implementation o f any eventual reforms in subsidies and tariffs, as well as
wider technical and commercial reforms.

96.     The Bank has played a similarly important role in the development o f Indonesia's roads, but
the project pipeline has slowed in recent years with difficulties experienced in respect o f governance.
The current portfolio includes the Second Eastern Indonesia Road Transport Project and the
Strategic Roads Improvement Project. A Western Indonesia National Roads Improvement Project
and a High Grade Highway Project are under discussion. The I D P L series provides a forum for


                                                    32
engagement on governance issues within the Ministry o f Public Works, which may over time ease
some o f the difficulties experienced with the Bank's road projects.

97.     Despite the chronic problems in piped water, the Bank has no current investment loans in the
sector. GPOBA grant-funded output-based aid projects are being conducted in Jakarta and Surabaya,
but otherwise Bank engagement i s primarily through trust-funded technical assistance. For many
years P D A M debt arrears have acted as a legal barrier to Ministry o f Finance approval for on-lending
o f Bank funds to most PDAMs. The debt restructuring reforms recognized in I D P L 2 are a significant
breakthrough for potential lending into the sector, although it will s t i l l take time for the debt
restructuring to occur. While reforms recognized through the I D P L can help to provide incentives to
sub-national governments or to improve the flow o f finance to the sector, the nitty gritty work o f
improving PDAMs' commercial and technical operations would be best supported by a program o f
investment projects. An Urban Water Supply and Sanitation Project, supporting investments in three
PDAMs, was recently approved by the Board.

98.      In support o f the PPP program, the Bank and IFC are jointly investing in the Indonesia
Infiastructure Finance Facility. This operation directly supports one o f the I D P L 3 triggers, and i s
timely given the financing difficulties for private infrastructure investment being experienced as a
result o f the global financial crisis. The Ministry o f Finance Risk Management Unit has requested a
$100 million World Bank guarantee or loan to support the proposed operations o f the Guarantee
Fund, establishment o f which i s an I D P L 3 trigger.

99.      If the I D P L program i s extended beyond the current series, consideration could be given to
selective engagement in additional sectors. The Bank has an extensive program o f community driven
development projects with significant infrastructure components. A proposed project addressing
Special Allocation Grants (DAK) i s intended to improve the effectiveness o f intergovernmental fiscal
flows in stimulating infrastructure investment. A project i s being prepared to address flood control
and urban planning in Jakarta. An existing Marine Electronic H i g h w q Project, funded by a GEF
grant, aims to improve safety and the environment in the Malacca Straits. And there are proposals for
an investment project in the rail sector, to support sectoral restructuring.



LESSONS LEARNED
100.     The initial design o f the I D P L program reflected general World Bank experience in the design
o f policy loans, as set out in Box 2 and discussed more extensively in the I D P L 1 Program Document.
The lessons learned over the past year relate to the specifics o f the I D P L program. This experience
suggests the usefulness o f the I D P L dialogue in advancing new ideas with key policy makers, as well
as the importance o f regular dialogue on the triggers, both to maintain momentum and to refine
agreement on policy content.



ANALYTIC'AL UNDERPINNINGS
 101,    The analytical underpinnings o f the I D P L program were set out in the I D P L 1 Program
Document. Chief among them i s a major cross-sectoral World Bank report, "Indonesia, Averting an
Infrastructure Crisis: A Framework for Policy and Action", which was published in 2004, and which
was substantially adopted by the Government. The cross-sectoral analysis o f critical infrastructure
issues was updated as part o f the 2007 Public Expenditure Review. In 2008, the Bank commenced a
study looking at issues o f land acquisition, in support o f the I D P L program. An update o f the 2004
infrastructure review i s currently being prepared, to provide a briefing to the incoming Government,
and to provide updated analytical underpinnings for the I D P L triggers for 20 10.

                 Box 2 Applicatian o f Good Practice Principles on Conditionality

Principle 1: Reinforce Ownership
The vast bulk of the IDPL program embodies reforms which have been at the center o f the
Government's own program and where there could be no doubt of the Government's own
commitment to the reform objectives. In such areas, the IDPL dialogue i s used to make suggestions
for improvements in the way in which the Government works towards its own objectives. In one or
two areas, the IDPL dialogue has been used to advance reforms which were not initially within the
Government's main program. In such areas, the IDPL dialogue has been used to convince key policy
makers o f the need for action, building championship for the reforms. The agencies directly
responsible for the relevant reforms have been given the task of identifying ways to address the
Government's underlying objectives. Thus, for example the Coordinating Ministry o f Economic
Affairs has championed reform o f land acquisition processes, but the national land agency, BPN,
chairs the Land Working Group, with support from the Coordinating Ministry. The Land Working
Group has drawn together multiple agencies to identify the underlying issues and develop responses
to them.

Principle 2: Agree up front with Government and partners on a coordinated accountability
framework
The policy matrix represents an agreed framework by Government and the Bank, involving
considerable overlap with an ADB budget support operation covering infrastructure. The matrix
reflects considerable discussion and agreement within government and subsequently with the Bank
regardingresponsible ministries and agencies accountable for the satisfaction of triggers.

Principle 3: Customize the accountability framework and modalities o Bank support to country
                                                                           f
circumstances
The policy matrix entails a subset of key reform measures that are part of the Government's broader
development program. Although the Bank i s engaged in dialogue across a number o f infrastructure
policy issues, many policy actions are left outside the scope o f the IDPL to take into account country
circumstances and the political economy. At the same time, trigger satisfaction has been supported by
a range o f technical, analytical and lending assistance provided by or coordinated with the World
Bank Group in areas including public-private partnerships and support for institutional development
in the MoPW.

Principle 4: Choose only actions critical for achieving results as conditionsfor disbursement
Triggers for the IDPL are refined over time, based on the indicative triggers established the previous
year. The trigger list i s focused on areas critical for achievement this year in order to ensure overall
outcomes of the lending series in 2010.

Principle 5: Conduct transparent progress reviews conducive to predictable and performance-
basedfinancial support
Regular missions are conducted to discuss with the Government progress towards each year's
indicative triggers. The IDPL loans are made annually, coinciding with the Government's fiscal year,
in order to enhance predictability of financial support.

    V. THE PROPOSED THIRD INFRASTRUCTURE DEVELOPMENT POLICY LOAN

102.     The I D P L program i s intended to increase the level and effectiveness o f infrastructure
financing, addressing the backlog o f infrastructure investment that arose in the decade following the
1997 financial crisis. Inadequate infrastructure currently acts as a constraint to Indonesia's growth
potential - most obviously in the case o f current widespread electricity blackouts, but also in hidden
costs o f severe traffic congestion, the health costs o f inadequate water, sanitation, and solid waste,
and the opportunity cost o f a non-existent national expressways network. The Bank's 2004 study,
"Averting an Infrastructure Crisis", identified potential infrastructure investments o f US$4.7 billion
that could boost GDP b y 2.4%.

 103. T o improve outcomes in infrastructure sectors, the I D P L program addresses financing directly
provided by the national government, the incentives for sub-national governments to improve
infrastructure delivery, and the policy environment for private infrastructure investment. The principal
intended benefit o f these elements o f the I D P L program i s a contribution to economic growth and
poverty reduction.

104. The I D P L program also supports related governance reforms, addressing risks associated with
increased infrastructure spending. These risks include social dislocation associated with land
acquisition, environmental impacts, and corruption. The I D P L program contributes to the policy
environment in each o f these areas, encouraging the Government to better integrate these concerns
into i t s infrastructure reforms.

 105.    The big picture o f the Government's infrastructure reforms i s one o f solid progress across a
broad front, with the I D P L reforms representing just a subset o f the entire set o f policy reforms.
Inevitably some reforms move faster than others, and progress emerges in unexpected areas. During
the course o f the I D P L program, the Government's attention to issues o f piped water has greatly
exceeded the expectations o f many seasoned sector experts. Indeed the progress this year i s one o f the
major justifications for the loan size. One o f the main obstacles to toll-road development has been
land acquisition, and here the Government appears to have made significant progress in recent times,
both through reforming legal processes and through the establishment o f special funds for land
acquisition. The introduction o f e-procurement has been an important innovation in the Ministry o f
Public Works.

106. In contrast, since the beginning o f the I D P L series it has been known that no significant
changes could be expected to electricity subsidies before the 2009 election. Progress i s gradually
being made in the area o f PPPs, but the overall results have been less than anticipated by the
Government early in i t s term. Improving road maintenance i s one o f the objectives o f the I D P L
program; while progress i s being made in terms o f outcomes, this has been largely achieved through
increased spending rather than significant experimentation with new ways o f operating. The I D P L
program has served as a useful forum for engagement with the Ministry o f Public Works on
governance issues, but substantial reforms will take time.

107. Reflecting the mixed progress in various reform areas, it i s necessary each year to adapt the
prior actions to reflect their evolution from the previous year's indicative triggers. Table 9 provides a
summary o f the changes to the indicative triggers defined in I D P L 2. The advanced timing o f this
year's operation (nine months after I D P L 2), combined with the transition period following the
election, has meant that some actions are at the advanced draft stage, and await swearing in o f the new
Government for formal approval or other actions to complete implementation. Examples include
revisions o f the program structure for DG Highways, formal approval o f which awaits the new
Government; revisions o f Perpres 67, which s t i l l needs Presidential signature; establishment o f the
Guarantee Fund, which while legally established s t i l l needs appointment o f a Board in order to be
                                                   35
established as a company; revised environmental legislation, which i s currently being debated by the
Parliament; and draft waste management regulations, which are s t i l l being finalized. In each o f these
cases, the Government's progress and continued commitment to reform i s evident. I t would be
possible to delay approval o f IDPL 3 in order to provide the time for greater progress in each o f these
areas, but on balance it was felt more important to meet the Government's request to conclude loan
negotiations with the current administration since there i s little doubt that the reforms are advancing.
In each o f these areas, the achievement o f the overall program objectives remains on track for 20 10.

108.      In the case o f implementing regulations for the Law on Solid Waste, the progress made this
year i s judged to be insufficient to be considered implementation o f the indicative trigger. Solid
progress has been made in drafting two out o f three regulations, but it falls short o f having a full set o f
completed drafts awaiting approval. The trigger has been shifted to IDPL 4, and i s expected to be
satisfied by the end o f 2009.

109.          Concerning the indicative trigger on the Ministry o f Public Works Inspector General, very
l i t t l e action was taken over the course o f the year. Progress will rely on technical assistance, to be
provided by consultants. These consultants have only recently been mobilized. They are now
working with the Inspector General to improve understanding o f issues such as risk-based auditing,
and have conducted a stock-take o f staff training and skills. By October 2009, an audit plan for 2010
will have been developed having regard to important risk factors. A training needs analysis i s
expected to be completed by the end o f 2009, and suggestions for reform o f audit manuals will be
completed by early 2010. A revised trigger for IDPL 4 has been developed which incorporates these
measures. The overall objective for the four-year IDPL program i s the production o f effective internal
audit reports, and their timely implementation. This objective remains achievable by the end o f 2010.

POLICY AREA I NATIONAL INFRASTRUCTURE
             :
Prior Action I : Maintain proposed 2010 APBN allocation for national infrastructure at least 30%
over 2007 level.

Evidence o Achievement: President's budget address to Parliament August 3, 2009
          f

111.     The final budget submission to Parliament w i l l not be made until after the Board date, but the
budget proposal for 2010 i s already well-defined. Table 10 sets out the current baseline budget
proposal for 2010. The baseline does not commit the full amount o f the available fiscal envelope,
providing flexibility for the incoming Government to announce increased spending on new initiatives.
It i s anticipated that the final approved budget's infrastructure allocation w i l l exceed the current
budget proposal.

 112.    An important recommendation o f the World Bank's 2004 study, Averting an Infrastructure
Crisis, was that Indonesia should substantially increase infrastructure investment. While improving
the quality and effectiveness o f spending are important, and are addressed through other IDPL
reforms, addressing the infrastructure backlog also requires an increase in the funds allocated to
infrastructure investment. This trigger addresses the part o f national infrastructure investment that i s
directly within the control o f the national government. The APBN allocations are the amounts
proposed to the Parliament, for purposes o f the forthcoming year's Budget. The monitoring indicators
examine the actual amounts invested during the IDPL program.

113.     For purposes o f this trigger, national infrastructure i s defined to include expenditure by the
Ministry o f Public Works and the Ministry o f Transport, Increasing budget allocations for these
ministries i s an important element o f the Government's strategy o f increasing overall infrastructure
investment.

Evidence o Achievement: Publication on PLN website
          f

114. Publication o f the PSO breakdown i s intended to stimulate public debate about the
beneficiaries o f the subsidies, thereby raising political pressure for reform. The forward estimate i s
intended to improve inter-ministerialcooperation at a point in time when it i s possible to influence the
key investment decisions which subsequently determine the operating and fuel costs.

 115.    The 2008 PSO breakdown (by region and consumer category) has been published on PLN's
website. The PLN PSO subsidy cost was Rp. 37 trillion in 2007 and Rp. 79 trillion in 2008. As
indicated in Table 11, 49.6% o f the subsidy goes to social consumers (eg hospitals) and R.l
consumers (the households most likely to have low incomes), meaning more than 50% o f the subsidy
i s received by higher income households, businesses, and government consumers. Java-Bali
accounted for 78.8% o f energy sales and 55.4% o f total subsidies, while areas outside Java-Bali
accounted for 2 1.2% o f sales and 44.6% o f total subsidies.

    feeding in assumptions from the RUPTL (approved by the Ministry o f Energy) as well as budget
    assumptions from the Ministry o f Finance. The projections are made on the assumption o f no change
    in consumer tariffs. With lower oil prices and reduced dependence on oil as new coal power plants
    come on line, the subsidy cost i s projected to fall to Rp. 53 trillion in 2009, and Rp. 43 trillion in
    2010. Thereafter, it has been assumed that fuel prices will rise again, resulting in subsidy costs o f Rp.
    53 trillion in 201 1 and Rp. 63 trillion in 2012.

    PR.01.02/BP.09/1066/2009

    117. In conjunction with development o f the Government's next five year plan (2010-2014),
    Bappenas i s engaged in a process o f redefining program structures to improve accountability. The
    Ministry o f Public Works i s one o f six government agencies, from more than 50, that have been
    selected to be the subject o f efforts to define objectives and outputs, permitting measurement o f the
    achievements o f ministerial directorates. The revised program architecture will be better aligned with
    responsibilities o f individual directorates. Accountability for achievement o f results will be enhanced
    when individual directorates are responsible for achievement o f individual performance indicators.

     118. Bappenas has issued guidelines for line ministries to prepare their revised program structures,
'   including objectives and outcomes. D G Highways has prepared a draft program structure, including
    objectives and outputs, and this has been discussed and agreed at the working level between Bappenas
    and D G Highways. Bappenas has been concerned to ensure that the new structures are approved by
    the incoming government, so that although the work i s in a sense completed, formal approval will not
    occur until January 2010.

     119. The Ministry o f Public Works, working with the Ministry o f Finance, has issued guidelines
    for the administration o f a scheme which will provide grants ("hibah") to sub-national governments
    after new piped water connections for poor households have been installed and operated for three
    months. The scheme i s authorized under recent regulations issued by the Ministry o f Finance for the
    provision o f conditional grants to sub-national governments (PMK 168/2008 and PMK 169/2008).
    The grants will be between Rp. 2 million ($175) and Rp. 4 million (about a quarter o f the estimated
    cost) per connection depending on the targeted number o f connections, and a maximum o f Rp. 20
    billion per district during 2010-2014. A budget request i s being prepared by the Ministry o f Public
    Works for funding o f Rp. 3 trillion, corresponding to 1.5 million new connections over 5 years.
    AusAID i s preparing a A$20 million grant which will finance around 60,000 connections, and the
    Ministry of Public Works i s in discussions with Bappenas concerning the level o f funding that will be
    provided from the State Budget. The Ministry o f Public Works has requested funding o f Rp. 3
    trillion, corresponding to 1S million new connections over 5 years.

120. If successful, this scheme could be readily expanded by the central government, as a means o f
achieving the Government's goal o f 10 million new piped water household connections. It could also
serve as a useful model for the use o f fiscal incentives for sub-national governments. Initial
socialization efforts with PDAMs and local governments suggest a strong level o f interest in
participation in the scheme.

                                                          f

Evidence o Achievement:
          f                      Coordinating    Minister for     the   Economy    Circular   No.    S-
S1/IwEKoN/08.2009

 121.   Perpres 67/2005 i s the Presidential Regulation governing the procurement o f infrastructure
PPPs. Among other matters it requires competitive tendering and specifies conditions under which
government support may be provided to PPPs. The Government has taken stock o f experience over
the past few years, and has prepared amendments to Perpres 67 to address i t s known weaknesses. All
relevant ministries have reviewed, commented, and agreed on the proposed content o f the
amendments. The draft has now been circulated by the Coordinating Minister to provide a final
opportunity for comment by Ministers, prior to Presidential signature.

122.     One o f the weaknesses o f the existing regulation i s that it does not provide for government
support to projects o f sub-national governments. For example, the absence o f any legal framework
for providing government support was one o f the obstacles facing the failed Jakarta monorail project.
The draft amendments would permit the issuance o f direct fiscal support or government guarantees
for projects o f sub-national governments.

123. Perpres 67 permits the termination o f PPP contracts in the event that the project sponsor fails
to achieve financial close within 12 months o f contract signing. But under the current definition o f
"financial close" it i s enough for financiers to have agreed to provide finance subject to various
conditions precedent. Even if such conditions are never satisfied, the sponsors claim the Government
has no right to terminate the contract. The draft amendments would define "financial close" as
occurring when a loan agreement has been signed for the funding o f the entire project, and at least
part o f the loan has been drawn down to begin construction. In this way, indefinite failure to satisfy
conditions precedent will trigger contract termination.

124. At present, the Ministry o f Finance may only authorize guarantees or direct financial support
for PPPs which receive three bids in a competitive tender. Given the infancy o f Indonesia's PPP
program, this requirement has proven to be a practical barrier to many economically desirable
projects. The draft amendments would permit government support in the event o f less than 3 bids
being received, provided that the transaction i s rebid at least once.

 125.    Finally, the amendments will require that any transfer o f shares by a PPP project sponsor
prior to the commencement o f commercial operations will require Ministerial approval having regard
to the purchaser's capacity to continue the project.

126.    The original indicative trigger defined in I D P L 2 was "hiring o f a private firm to act as a
transaction adviser on a success fee for at least one PPP transaction." Bappenas i s keen to use the
success fee mechanism, but has been concerned about whether or not this form o f procurement was
legally permitted. Discussions with the LKPP, the chief procurement organization, have established

                                                 41
that there are no legal barriers, but the delay has meant that the original trigger will not be satisfied in
time for appraisal in August. Accordingly, the current trigger i s proposed as a substitute.

Prior Action 6: Issuance o Government Regulation establishing the Guarantee Fund.
                          f

Evidence o Achievement: Government Regulation No. 35/2009,
          f

127.   A Government Regulation establishing the Guarantee Fund has been approved by the
President. Other measures s t i l l required for the legal establishment o f the Guarantee Fund include
preparation o f the articles o f association and appointment o f the Board o f Directors and Board o f
Commissioners.

Prior Action 7: Mobilization offinance for the Indonesia Infrastructure Financing Facility (IIFF).

Evidence o Agreement: Founders' Agreement, dated June 30, 2009.
          f

128.    The Indonesia Infrastructure Financing Facility i s intended to mobilize long-term finance for
use in private infrastructure projects. Capitalization o f the IIFF will occur in stages, as i t s operations
expand. Contributions from the Government, the World Bank, IFC, the ADB, and the German
Government (Deutsche Investitions und Entwicklungsgesellschaft, DEG) have been approved by the
respective institutions (see Figure 18). The last approval was the $140 million World Bank/IFC
investment, approved by the Board in June 2009.

 129.   For purposes o f establishing and incorporating the company, the initial equity contributions to
the IIFF total $10 million. The equity contributions will be increased to $200 million over 3-5 years,
and the Government will also furnish $200 million o f subordinated debt. These contributions will be
leveraged to raise more than U S $ 1 billion o f private finance from domestic and international markets,
over 4-6 years. The Government, the World Bank, and the ADB, are contributing to capitalization o f
the company through a public parent company, P.T. Sarana Multi Infrastructure (SMI). With
mobilization o f the start-up capital now complete, the Government expects to appoint Board members
and register the IIFF as a new corporation by October 2009.

POLICY AREA IV: LAND ACQUISITION, ENVIRONMENT, AND PROCUREMENT
Prior Action 8: Satisfactory implementation o the Land Working Group's action plan.

Evidence o Achievement: BPN Circular No. 396/ND/DII/VIII,2009
          f

 130. In 2007, the Government established the Land Working Group and two sub-committees, with
membership drawn from the national land agency (BPN), the Coordinating Ministry o f Economic
Affairs, Ministry o f Housing, Ministry o f Public Works, and BAPPENAS. The "land banking" sub-
committee deals with issues o f land zoning and purchase o f land in anticipation o f future
developments. The "land acquisition" sub-committee has developed the action plan that i s targeted by
this trigger. The actions taken under the action plan are addressed in.

131. The land action,plan identifies a set o f issues which the Land Working Group considered to
be key obstacles to timely land acquisition for infrastructure projects. N o t all o f the actions identified
at the end o f 2008 have been undertaken, but there has been significant progress in reforming land
acquisition procedures, particularly with a move to increased reliance on independent appraisal as the
basis o f valuation, rather than tax assessments; socialization o f new procedures permitting land
acquisition funds to be consigned to a court pending resolution o f disputes over the quantum o f
compensation, application o f the court consignment mechanism, and measures to increase the supply
o f independent appraisers and land surveyors. Overall, the Bank considers that the actions taken
represent satisfactory implementation o f the action plan. The measures taken appear in practice to
have accelerated land acquisition processes, an important objective o f infrastructure reforms. The

INDICATIVE TRIGGERS FOR IDPL 4
Indicative Trigger 1. Increase the real APBN allocation for national infrastructure proposed for 2011
beyond the real level allocated in 2009, by an amount corresponding to the real increase in actual
spending achieved between 2008 and 2009.

 134.    Ensuring that infrastructure expenditures are maintained or increased in real terms has been
one of the central planks o f the IDPL program. The Minister of Finance i s keen to increase the budget
allocations for national infrastructure, but only if there i s demonstrated ability by the Ministries of
Public Works and Transport to actually spend those funds. Accordingly, the Minister has asked for a
trigger which provides incentives for the line ministries to increase their actual budget outcomes.

Indicative Trigger 2. Review o basic electricity tariff and level and coverage o subsidy, including
                              f                                                  f
                                                                                   f
optionsfor automatic adjustment in response to cost changes, and better targeting o subsidies.

 135. During 2009, an election year, the Government will not make any commitments concerning
the direction or magnitude o f any potential changes to electricity tariffs or subsidies. In 20 10, a review
o f these matters should be possible.

Indicative Trigger 3. Preparation o medium-term plan and budget submissions by Ministry o Public
                                  f                                                     f
Works based on medium-term budget ceilings.

136. Bappenas expects to begin implementation of its proposed medium-term expenditure
framework in 20 10.

Indicative Trigger 4. Development o draft regulations establishing a Road Preservation Fund with
                                       f
revenues derived directly f r o m charges related to road use, and embodyingprinciples o transparency
                                                                                        f

                                                    45
137.    Articles 29-32 o f the new Traffic and Road Transport Law (22/2009) provide for the
establishment o f a Road Preservation Fund. The details o f this fund remain to be determined.
International experience suggests that there i s likely to be considerable debate over issues such as the
degree o f independence o f the entity that administers the fund, or hypothecation o f road charges.
Senior Indonesian policy makers share the assessment that it i s unlikely that complete agreement will
be reached on such issues within one year. Accordingly, the trigger proposes the development of
draft implementing regulations, as a way o f using the IDPL dialogue to inform and influence the
drafting, taking account o f international experiences.

138. This indicative trigger i s a replacement for a trigger that was initially proposed as part of
IDPL 1. The original trigger proposed "80% o f required maintenance/preservation budget received
and applied to national roads by 2010."       The Government uses a road maintenance model to
calculate the funds that would be optimally applied to road maintenance in the absence o f any budget
constraints. During the most recent preparation mission the Government advised that only around
40% o f the "required" budget i s currently made available for road maintenance, and that a shift to
80% i s not achievable over the next year.

139.     During the appraisal mission the team will discuss possible alternative triggers with the
Government. One possibility would be a replacement trigger focused on improving road
management: "expanded utilization o f output and performance-based road contracts (OPRC)". OPRC
i s currently being piloted under the Bank's SRIP project, and the Bank i s looking to expand this
experience in a new project.

Indicative Trigger 5. Provision o long-term loans to 25 PDAMs.
                                 f

I t i s anticipated that the measures the Government i s currently undertaking in the water sector will
induce multiple long-term loans to PDAMs, assisting in the goal o f expanding access to water
services. Over the next year the Bank will review the measures, having regard to matters that include
the targeting o f subsidies, affordability o f water tariffs, fiscal risks borne by the Government, and the
commercial focus o f PDAMs.

Indicative Trigger 6. Financial close o 2 PPP projects, prepared and tendered in compliance with
                                       f
Perpres 67.

Despite the many PPPs under preparation, the IDPL program seeks just two projects reaching close by
2010. The IDPL program has been designed with deliberate conservatism, to avoid pressing for
undue haste in completion o f PPP transactions. Possible candidate transactions include the Central
Java power plant being prepared by IFC Advisory Services, and several bulk water treatment plants.

Indicative Trigger 7. Operationalization o the Guarantee Fund including staff and operating
                                         f
procedures.

The Government i s committed to the development o f the Guarantee Fund. The design phase i s s t i l l
ongoing, and the actual progress made towards its operation will need to be reviewed over the course
o f 2010.

Indicative Trigger 8. IIFFfully staffed and operational.

It i s anticipated that the IIFF will be staffed and operational by early in 2010.

Indicative Trigger 9. Adoption o implementing regulations for the Law on Municipal Solid Waste
                                f

handling and specialhndustrial waste. It i s anticipated that they will receive Presidential approval by
the end o f 2009.

Indicative Trigger I O . Implementation o full transaction-based e-procurement system for all Ministry
                                         f

This will require actions by the Ministry o f Communications, to provide implementing regulations for
the recent law which permits electronic signatures; and action by LKPP to authorize amended
procurement processes.

Indicative Trigger 11. Satisfactory implementation o the Ministry o Public Works' Inspector
                                                     f             f

Consultants have been mobilized to work with the Inspector General, and risk-based auditing will be a
particular focus o f this work.

POVERTY AND SOCIAL IMPACT
140. A review o f the poverty and social impacts o f the I D P L program i s at Annex 5. The I D P L
program i s intended to lead to increased investment plans over the next several years, which in turn
will take several years to induce construction and delivery o f infrastructure services. In general, the
poverty and social impacts o f increased infrastructure investment will be positive, through the benefits
o f induced economic growth, and through the direct provision o f infrastructure services.

141. Potential negative impacts include traffic accidents associated with increased road usage,
social dislocation and inadequate compensation for land acquisition, and potential price increases for
electricity and water services. Recent years have seen increased efforts by the police to improve
reporting o f accidents; increased efforts by various cities to improve public transport which may assist
in reducing road accidents (about 60% o f which involve motorcyclists); and World Bank roads
projects included measures to promote improved design standards, helping to reduce the cause o f
accidents. The Bank i s engaging with the Government through the Land Working Group to address
issues associated with land acquisition, including social dislocation and inadequate compensation.
The recent history o f Indonesia's treatment o f fuel price increases suggests a capacity to balance the
negative impacts o f price increases against other social benefits through democratic processes, and to
introduce compensation where appropriate.

142. The linkages between the prior actions recognized in I D P L 3 and the social impacts described
in Annex 5 are summarized in Table 13.

                                                          growth and through the direct provision o f
                                                          infrastructure services; and will also tend t o induce the

    ENVIRONMENTAL ASPECTS
     143.    Successful implementation o f the I D P L program i s likely to lead to increased and improved
    infrastructure services, with both positive and negative environmental consequences. Annex 5
    describes the nature o f these potential effects, and reviews the Government's capacity to deal with
    these effects, and the measures being put in place to strengthen this capacity.

    144.     Many o f the reforms supported by the I D P L program will help to improve environmental
    outcomes. Increased sanitation, potentially higher electricity prices to promote energy conservation,
    promotion o f recycling and sanitary landfills, and improved AMDAL processes are all reforms which
    would help to improve the environment. On the negative side, the I D P L program seeks increased
    infrastructure investment, which carries risks o f negative environmental effects. These potential
    effects include greenhouse gases and other emissions from increased electricity generation capacity,
    air pollution associated with traffic on increased road capacity, and local environmental impacts
    associated with construction works for all forms o f infrastructure facilities. Among the latter, the
    most significant effects would arise from road construction in environmentally sensitive areas.

    145.      Measures are underway to address all o f these classes o f negative effects. Following on from
    i t s successful hosting o f the 2007 B a l i Climate Change Convention, the Government has developed
    several initiatives demonstrating high-level commitment to addressing climate change. An important
    step to improve air quality was taken with the elimination o f leaded petrol in 2007 and individual
    cities are taking measures to promote public transport. The Ministry o f Environment i s taking
    measures to strengthen the capacity o f sub-national governments to manage local environmental
    impacts, and the Ministry o f Public Works has recently enhanced i t s environmental standards related
    to road development.

    IMPLEMENTATION, MONITORING AND EVALUATION
    146.    The monitoring and evaluation framework for the I D P L Program was discussed in the I D P L 1
    Program Document, was slightly revised in I D P L 2, and i s summarized in Table 14. Annex 7 sets out
    progress towards the target indicators and will be updated during the appraisal mission.

FIDUCIARY ASPECTS, DISBURSEMENT AND AUDITING
147.    Annex 8 sets out an extensive evaluation o f the government's public financial management
systems, including a conclusion that adequate protections are in place to support policy lending.
Reforms aimed at strengthening the public financial management system are included in the separate
macroeconomic D P L series.

148. The Borrower i s the Republic o f Indonesia and this operation i s a single-tranche IBRD loan o f
US$250 million that would be made available upon loan effectiveness, as all policy actions supported
by the loadcredit would have been completed prior to Board presentation. For the IBRD loan, the
Government has confirmed that Indonesia would borrow this amount as a Variable Spread Loan
(VSL) in U S $ currency with annuity repayment schedule linked to commitments.

 149.    Loan disbursement will follow standard Bank procedures for Development Policy Lending.
The loan amount will be disbursed into a foreign currency account o f the Borrower at Bank Indonesia
that forms part o f Indonesia's official foreign exchange reserves. The equivalent Rupiah amount will
immediately be transferred to the General Operational Treasury (SBUN) account o f the Borrower that
i s used to finance budget expenditures, as the loan i s intended to be used to support the general
government budget. The Borrower will provide to the Bank a written confirmation that this transfer
has been completed, and provide to the Bank any other relevant information relating to these matters
that the Bank may reasonably request. Disbursements o f the loan will not be linked to any specific
purchases and no procurement requirements have to be satisfied, except that the Borrower i s required
to comply with the standard negative l i s t o f excluded items that may not be financed with Bank loan
proceeds. Ongoing discussions with the Government on the overall reform program in the
infrastructure being supported by this D P L will form the basis for reporting on substantive policy
issues.

R I S K S AND R I S K MITIGATION
Corruption (high risk)

150. Infrastructure investment i s vulnerable to corruption at all stages o f the project cycle.
Potential corruption in Indonesia poses risks that the full development potential o f the increased
infrastructure investment sought by the I D P L series will not be realized. It also poses reputational
risks for the Bank, in being associated with all forms o f infrastructure through the I D P L series.

151. There i s no simple mitigation strategy. The Bank i s pursuing multiple anti-corruption
initiatives in Indonesia, including in respect o f infrastructure. There are anti-corruption initiatives in
multiple Bank infrastructure projects, and the procurement reforms included as triggers are part o f the
anti-corruption effort. More generally, I D P L triggers support greater transparency and accountability
through improved planning process, and greater competition and transparency in the development o f
PPPS.

Government Capaciv (high risk)

152. While the Government may be committed to reform objectives, the ability to translate that
commitment into practical reform achievements i s limited by the capacity o f the bureaucracy. In
several areas o f the I D P L program, reform has been slower over the past twelve months than

                                                    51
    anticipated by the Government at the time the program was agreed. This has typically been the result
    o f l o w capacity, and weak bureaucratic coordination across ministries.

    153. Mitigation strategies include realism o f triggers, based on likely reform progress, and the
    provision o f technical assistance. A wide range o f donors are supporting the Government's
    infrastructure reforms, across all areas o f the I D P L program.

    Government commitment (low risk)

    154. I t now seems very likely that the President Yudhuyono will be re-elected, and that the broad
    Government directions will be maintained over the next five years. Nevertheless, there will be some
    changing o f ministers, and the new Government can be expected to announce several new initiatives.
    This may pose risks for the achievement o f some indicative triggers in 2010. The mitigation strategy
    for this risk i s inherent in the nature o f a D P L series: if the new Government i s not committed to
    maintaining reform momentum, the 20 10 operation could be delayed or cancelled.

`   Macroeconomic Stability (moderate risk)

      155. The main risk i s the possibility o f financial disruption because o f sudden (and large) capital
     outflows. In recent years there have been significant improvements in Indonesian macroeconomic
     indicators which translate into improved resilience to external shocks. But risks nevertheless remain,
     especially during a period o f global financial turmoil. Indonesia's external position remains sound
     with the current account ending 2008 in a small surplus o f USD 0.6 bn. After declining by close to
     USD 10 bn in September and October, foreign reserves have subsequently been relatively stable,
     rising slowly from USD 50 billion dollars to USD 57.6 by the end o f June, equivalent to more than 4
     months o f imports and official debt repayments. In addition to i t s own official reserve holdings,
     Indonesia has also gained access to various bilateral and multilateral swap arrangements. Both
     Government and external debt-to-GDP ratios have declined to the 30 to 35 percent range and Bank
     and Fund debt sustainability analyses indicate that Indonesia should be able to withstand various
     crises, measured as a shock to the exchange rate or interest rate while sustaining debt payments.
    However, Indonesia i s a financially open economy and there are significant foreign holdings
     especially in the stock market and Government bonds. Portfolio outflows at the end o f 2008 moved
    the overall balance o f payments into a deficit o f USD 1.9 billion for the whole year, the first annual
     deficit since 2001. The year-end portfolio outflows were driven by both residents, who shifted USD
     2.7 bn into offshore bank accounts, and non-residents selling down their holdings o f debt securities
    (net outflow o f USD 3.8 bn from both corporate and Government securities). Indonesian corporations
    are believed to have reasonably well diversified finance and to not be significantly leveraged, but, for
    historical reasons domestic capital markets are quite volatile. A significant depreciation could affect
    some corporations and result in rising NPLs and erosion o f bank capital. In addition, the Indonesian
    Government has large gross financing needs over the next few years and the availability and cost o f
    this gross financing poses risks despite the generally strong fiscal position. Debt service in 2009 plus
    mobile external bond and equity holdings begin to add up compared with reserves. A prolonged
    recession with continued risk aversion episodes may pose challenges from a balance o f payments
    perspective. Mitigating these risks will require solid cooperation between Bank Indonesia and the
    economic ministries to reassure bond holders that their investments are safe (from inflation and
    exchange movements) while crowding in private investment to the extent possible through the kinds
    o f structural reforms supported by the DPL. The Government has moved very proactively to deal with
    the various threats.

    156.    Subsidies also pose risks for macroeconomic stability. As international o i l prices decline
    subsides also fall, but commodity price reversions also remain possible. There remain significant
    subsidies on f u e l and electricity in Indonesia, despite the increase in administered fuel prices (28.7
                                                       52
percent) in May 2008. At present, marginal changes in world prices are budget neutral but fixed fuel
prices and the subsidies they create represent a threat to fiscal sustainability in the longer term (not
too mention their opportunity cost, regressivity and that they do not promote efficiency). While a plan
to move to market prices would be first best, this i s likely on hold until after the election in 2009
because of the political risks involved. But as the Government's decision to raise administered fuel
prices last May demonstrated, if the economic situation warrants it, the Government has been willing
to make difficult decisions. In the meantime there are ongoing efforts to reduce subsidies in other
ways. Most immediately there i s a program to introduce LPG (subsidized but less so) in urban areas
while phasing out kerosene (the most subsidized fuel). In addition, the budget for 2009 proposes that
the regions share in the cost o f fuel subsidies, thus reducing their impact on the central Government
and shifting it to the regional Governments that have been running surpluses.

             proceed with the Third Inhstructure Development Policy Loan (IDPL-3) and to brief you on
             recent significant achievements in implementing its infrastructure policy reform agenda, and to
             outline the further progress we anticipate in the challenging year ahead. In the interests o f
             brevity, we focus on those actions within the broader reform agenda that have been included in
             the IDPL policy matrix. The letter should accordingly be read in conjunction with our letter of
             October 28 2008 to yourself, the President of the Asian Development Bank and the President
             of the Japan International Cooperation Agency, as this describes the broader context o f these
             reforms. In sum, for 2009, we request that the World Bank provide an Infrastructure
             DevelopmentPolicy Loan of U 250 million dollars.

             Macro Economic, F&wl and Politkol Context
                      A decade of sustained economic, financial and governance reforms has enabled
             Indonesia to weather the global fmancial and economic orisis economic far better than many
             analysts predicted. While the challenges have been difficult, the economy has continued to
             grow robustly, the banking sector h s been little impacted by housing debt-related problems
                                                 a
             that have caused turmoil in the US and elsewhere, and costs o f the fiscal stimulus package we
             elected to provide has bem well within the limits o f fiscal prudence.
                    Economic growth for the fmt semester o f 2009 i s at 4.2%, which i s significantly less
            than the 6% projeoted when the 2009 Budget was finalized, but still was the third highest in
            Asia after China end India Exports and imports slowed by 14.4% and 20.4% respectively,
            but this was offset by growth o f 16.4% in government consumption, 5.7% in public
            consumption, and 7.6% in investment. We are now expecting growth for the full year to be
            around 45%.
                     Inflation has declined sharply from the year-on-year rate o f 11 .I% 2008, and we
                                                                                         for
            expect the equivalent figure for 2009 to be 5%. During the period from March 2008 to March
            2009, the Rupiah weakened sharply from around 9,100 to around 12,100 to the US Dollar, but
            has since quickly recovered to its present level o f around 9,900. This reflects a growing
            international confidence in Indonesia's economic fundamentals, which has been little affected

by recent terrorist bombings in the Mm'ott and Ritz-carlton, Jakarta. We currently project
the exchange rate will average Rp10,OOO to the U dollar during 2010. Slowing inflation has
                                                 S
enabled Bank Indonesia to progressively reduce its benchmark 3-month interest rate h m a
recent peak of around 11.5% in November 2008 to its current level of around 6.65%. We
expect the rate to be maintainedat around 6.5% during 201 0.
         The 2009 State Budget Law provided for very modest increases in Central
Government revenues and expenditures as compared with the audited outcomes for 2008.
However, it was quickly recognized that amendments would be needed in light of the fast
deteriorating external environment, and agreement was reached in February to increase the
planned deficit h m 1% o f GDP (Rp51.3 trillion) to 2.5% (Rp139.5 trillion) and to provide a
fiscal stimulus package totaling Rp73.3 trillion. This comprised Rp56.3 trillion for tax
reductions and Rp17.0 trillion for increased spending, with Rp12.2 trillion of the latter being
for infrastructure. The increaseddeficit ir being financed from sourxs includingcany-over of
unspent budget funds fium 2008, standby loans from the World Bank and other partners, and
domestic bond issues.
                                                                             s
          Looking forward to 2010, the priorities for the Draft State Budget a presented to the
DPR on August 3 include: maintaining and expanding programs to improve the welfare o f the
poor; continuation o f ongoing fiscal stimulus programs, including for infiwtructure
development; supporting economic revival, including through provision o f tax and duty
incentives; continuing the ongoing bureaucratic reform; and maintaining education's share o f
total Central Government spending at 20% or above. The proposed fiscal deficit o f Rp. 98
trillion is significantly below the amended figure for 2009 and equates to 1.6% o f projected
GDP.
        As you are aware, 2009 General and Presidential Elections have been conducted
peacefully. President Yudhoyono has been reelected in one round. Markets generally
perceived the growth and political stability outcomes positively and financial markets have
continued to strengthen, while inflation continues to fall to multi-year levels. We are confident
that the outcomes will ensure continuity of the key policies adopted by the current
Government while also enabling the deepening of governance reforms and sharper focusing of
energy and other subsidies.

Infrastructure Development and Reform Program
    The Government's comprehensive medium-term infrastructure development and policy
reform program aims to:
        Increase the capacity, extend the coverage, and improve the condition of infrastructure
       networks and facilities through increasedpublic and private investment;
       Enhance infrastructure service delivery through raising efficiency and driving down
       costs;
       Improve the financial viability of public infrastructure enterprises through tariff and
       subsidy policy reforms that ensure continued affordability o f basic services for the
       poor; and
       Improve safety standards and limit adverse environmental impacts.
Improving governance is a common theme that runs across all initiatives.
        The adopted action plan, which i s adjusted regularly in the light of experience and
evolving circumstances, i s very broad in scope, with the IDPL program focusing on a
relatively small subset o f high priority initiatives.

Recent Achievements and Future Prioritia
CentralGovernment injmiructure Spending:
         Expenditure allocations for infrastructure development and maintenance have
increased substantially in recent State budgets. In particular, funding for the Ministry o f
Public Works (whose responsibilities include development and maintenance o f the national
mad network) and the Ministry of Transport (which manages Central Government
expenditures on, among others, railway, port, and airport infrastructure) has risen from
Rp34.98 trillion in the 2007 budget to Rp48.11 trillion in the amended 2008 budget, and to
Rp51.73 trillion in 2009 budget. Although infrastructure spending i s proposed to decline
slightly to Rp 49.94 trillion in 2010, it i s still 42% higher than for 2007.
         These increases have been achieved despite greatly increased spending on subsidies,
notably for fuel and power, and on education, where in 2009 the share of overall budget
spending reached the constitutionally mandated 20% Ievel for the first time. We are
accordingly confident that-with an improving external environment, lower primary energy
prices, and more sharply focused subsidies--the incoming Government will have ample fucal
space to maintain infrastructure spending at a level well above 30% o f the 2007 allocation.
        In parallel with raising the level o f State Budget infrastructure spending, the
Government i s ais0 striving to improve expenditure effectiveness.           One important
manifestation o f this is the ongoing initiative which encompasses redefining State Budget
expenditure programs and activities so as to better align with agency organization structures,
establishing meaningful program performance indicatoa, and adopting medium-term
expenditure frameworks (MTEF) and performancebased budgeting in line with the
requirements o f the 2003 State Finance Law.
        A11 agencies are now in the process o f revising their program structures in line with
the guidelines issued by Bappenas for preparing the 2010-2014 Medium Term Development
Plan (RPJM). The amended structure for programs managed by the Ministry o f Public Works,
including preservation and development of the national road network, has been agreed in
August 2009.
         The Ministry of Public Works is one of six agencies selected to pilot the use of MTEF
and performancebased budgeting processes for the 2011 State Budget. Guidelines for this
have been developed by Bappenas and the Ministry o f Finance, drawing on advice from the
World Bank and other partners, and were issued in July. The DirectorateGeneral o f Highways
sees considerable benefits stemming from these important reforms, and its already well
established road pavement and bridge management systems position it to contribute effectively
to the pilot initiative.
         As noted previously, the Government has signaled its intent to ensure that spending on
subsidies, including compensation provided to State-owned enterprises for public service
obligations (PSOs), i s in future focused more sharply on the poor. This will pose some
difficult challenges and require careful planning. As the first step, it will be necessary to build
public awareness and understanding o f the enormous opportunity cost of poor subsidy
targeting. With t h i s in mind we have required PT PLN to make available, on its website,
information on the subsidies flowing to its various customer categories in 2006, 2007 and
2008. In addition, PLN has also posted the agreed thme-year forward projection o f annual
electricity PSO payments on the assumption of no tariff increases. During 2010 we plan to
conduct a comprehensive review o f the current electricity tariff and PSO policy with the aim,
among others, o f ensuring subsidies more precisely targeted. Considerationwill also be given
to re-introducing automatic tariff adjustment for certain customer categories so as to better
manage fiscal risks.

Regional GovernmentInfmstructure Investment
         The Government accords very high priority to enabling much-needed new investment
in urban piped water services and to improving management o f the more than 350 municipal
water utilities (PDAMs). Important steps have already been taken in 2006, when the Minister
of Home Affiirs issued tariff guidelines aimed at enabling full cost-recoverywhile providing a
lifeline tariff for the poor, and in August 2008, when the Minister o f Finance established a
voluntary debt restructuring program for PDAMs with arrean on debt service payments to
Central Government. The latter has attracted considerable interest despite stringent eligibility
conditions which include compliance with the above tariff policy. Of the 175 PDAMs with
payment arrears, 85 have already applied to participate in the debt reshvcturing program, with
15 applications having been approved by the Policy Review Team, 62 applications currently
under review, and 8 applications rejectedor refened back.
        In June, a central Government loan guarantee and subsidy scheme, designed to enable
PDAMs to borrow on affordable terms from participating domestic banks, was established by
Presidential Regulation 29/2009. The scheme is open to PDAMs participating in the debt
restructuring program or having a `healthy' audit rating, and that meet other conditions
including establishing an escrow account for water revenues. The PDAM default risk will be
shared 30:40:30 between the lending bank, Cenml Government, and respective local
governmenf with the local government being required to agree use o f the fiscal grant
`Intercept mechanism' to backstop payment o f its obligations in the event a guarantee is called.
        In parallel, the Government is preparing to implement an output-based scheme for
incentivizing PDAMs to connect new customers and, in particular, low income customers.
The adopted model will enable participating PDAMs to obtain a fixed grant for each new
connection which has delivered water for at least 3 months, with funds being channeled using
the new regional grants mechanism established by the Minister of Finance in November 2008.
The Australian Government has agreed to fimd a large scale pilot program under its Water and
Sanitation Initiative and implementation o f this will commence shortly. Discussions are also
currently ongoing among the concerned Government agencies to fmalize an expanded program
which would be funded in large part from the State budget.
Public-Private Partnerships
         The results of the Government's efforts to mobilize increased private investment in
infrastructure.through Public-Private Partnerships have fallen short of expectations, and it i s
recognized that future prospects have been adversely impacted by greatly increased risk
aversion in international and domestic credit markets. The underlying impediments to further
progress in this a m have been identifiedand we are.working systematically to address them.
          Cenhal to these efforts is the ongoing initiative to refine Presidential Regulation
67f2005 on Public-Private Partnerships, which specifies requirements and procedures for
project preparation, screening and prioritization, tendering, and implementation, and defines
policy for the provision o f Central Government direct and contingent support. Lessons of
experience have helped identify several areas where its provisions need to be amended or
supplemented. These include clarifying the authority of Central Government to provide
support for sub-national projects and the right o f contracting agencies to terminate projects
which fail to secure fmancial close and first debt drawdown within twelve months. The draft
o f the revised PresidentialRegulation has now been cleared by all Ministers concerned prior to
its transmittal to the President for signature.
         Land acquisition problems have continued to impede the realization of certain types of
major infrastructure projecc notably toll roads. The Government i s committed to utilizing the
powers conferred by existing laws to enable timely purchase of needed land and property at
fair prices through processes that properly respect existing ownership and usage rights. To this
end, a Land Working Group was established under the chairmanship o f the National Lands
Agency (BPN) to develop and coordinate the implementation o f a comprehensive plan of




                                          57

action. Implementationof this i s now underway and the results to date are encouraging, with
land acquisition having already been completed for several key toll roads which had
previously suffered long delays.
         Another key factor impeding realization of sound PPP projects has been the inability
of developers to secure long-term fmancing on suitable tern. The banking sector has limited
capacity to provide such financing due to its heavy dependence on short-term deposits while
domutic capital markets are still relatively underdeveloped. The Governmenthas committed
to address this through initiating the establishment o f two new institutions. The Indonesia
Infi-astructunFinancing Facility (IIFF) is in process o f being established as a private non-bank
financial institution to provide a range o f fmancial products and advisory services.
Government will be an indirect minority shareholder and other shareholders will include ADB,
IFC, DEG and private investors. IIFF i s expected to commence operation in Octoberthii year.
        The InfrastructureGuarantee Fund i s also in process ofbeing established with the dual
objectives o f increasing the credit enhancement value o f guarantees provided by the Ministry
of Finance and strengthening the management o f infrashuctun-related contingent liabilities.
GovernmentRegulation 35t2.009,which was issued in May, provides for its establishment as a
Stateowned limited liability company under the direct supervision of the Minister o f Finance.
The initial paid-up capital of Rpl trillion will be sourced from the 2009 State budget. The
World Bank has advised on the design o f this new institution and the Government has
requested further support from it in the form of a loan to increase its financial capacity.
         Efforts are also continuing to develop a pipeline o f soundly prepared projects that
comply fully with the requirements o f Presidential Regulation 67/2005 and will be capable o f
attracting investors and lenders in the cumnt financing environment. We are optimistic that
the proposed Central Java 2 x lOOOMW coal-fired super-critical steam power plant, which has
been prepared with transaction advisory assistance h m IFC, is one such project. More
generally, we are confident that it will be possible during 2010 to reach financial close on at
least two fully compliant PPP projects.
Environment and Governance
       During the past year, the Government's efforts on the environmental front have
focused on securing needed improvements to Law 23/1997 on Environmental Management.
The proposed changes to Law 23/1997 are designed among others to improve the
environmental impact assessment (AMDAL) process and strengthen its enforceability. Draft
amendments were delivered to the DPR in late 2008 and are currently being deliberated. It is
expected that the amendment will be enacted within the term ofthe current parliament.
         As noted previously, governance improvement i s an overarching theme o f the
Government's reform agenda and is being pursued through numerous channels, most o f which
are not specific to infrastructure. However, in view o f the large and rapidly increasing funding
allocated for infrastructure works through the State Budget, the Ministry o f Public Works has
been selected to pilot improvements in procurement processes and internal control
mechanisms.
          The Directorate General o f Highways is continuing to use partial e-procurement for all
civil works on the national road network, and we are confident that regulations now being
drafted will enable implementation o f full procurement from 2010. To complement this
initiative, the Director General o f Highways has established a procurement task force for the
purposes of supporting and advising individual procurement committees in handling complex
procurement problems. The Ministry's Manpower and Construction Industry Development
Agency has meanwhile embarked on a complementary but broader initiative to assess
procurement capacity problems and identify constraints which impair the Ministry's ability to
secure best value for money. This i s expected to result, among othen, in specific proposals for
addressing identified abuses in the current system for conhctor certificationand licensing.

         In parallel, the Ministry's Inspectorate General has embarked on the implementation
o f a comprehensive action plan centered on the use ofrisk-based audit processes. A risk-based
methodology has been developed, and has been used in preparing the audit plan for 2010.
Staff training has also commenced.


ConcludingRemarks
        We are conscious that the current level of inflastructure investment i s still well below
that needed to sustain economic growth at the pace required for the creation of adequate new
employment opportunities or for accelerating expanded access to basic infrastructure services.
However, we are also confident that the measures developed and implemented over the past
four years provide 'a sound platform for moving forward, and that the recent election results
will ensure continuingcommitment to the adopted reform agenda coupled with an enhanced
capacity to shape and drive its implementation.

                              Indonesia

On July 13,2009, the Executive Board of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) concluded the
Article IV consultationwith Indonesia.'

Background

Indonesia entered the current global crisis with strong initial conditions. Aided by a generally
favorable global economic climate that prevailed prior to the recent crisis, Indonesia's
fundamentals were strengthened through sound macroeconomic policy implementation,
including prudent debt management and developing a sound financial sector. Economic growth
averaged about 6 percent since 2005, fiscal performance was strong, the current account was
in surplus, both public and external debt dropped to about 30 percent of GDP, and international
reserves rose to a relatively comfortable level.

Notwithstandingthe initial impact of the global crisis, the economy has rebounded in 2009.
During the last quarter of 2008, various factors-falling commodity prices, liquidity problems in
sane segments of the banking sector, default by a private sector conglomerate on its
obligations, and general global risk aversion-led to a sharp deterioration in market conditions.
However, with relatively strong corporate and banking sector balance sheet positions, high
capitalization and profitability of the banking system, and a series of mitigating policy measures,
the economy was able to absorb the impact of the Crisis. These factors, combined with the
stronger than expected recovery in Q1 of 2009, have boosted domestic and foreign investor
confidence.

  Under Article IV of the IMPSArticles of Agreement, the IMF holds bilateral discussions with
members, usually every year. A staff team visits the country, collects economic and financial
information, and discusses with officials the country's economic developments and policies. On
return to headquarten, the staff prepares a report, which forms the basis for discussion by the
Executive Board. At the conclusion of the discussion, the Managing Director, as Chairman of the
Board, summarizes the views of Executive Directors, and this summary is transmitted to the
country's authorities.

The economy's resilience to the weak global conditions was evident in the stronger than
expected GDP growth in Q l of 2009 that vas supported by particularly strong consumption, as
private consumption benefited from a large election-related spending stimulus. External
accounts also improved in Q1 as the current account was positive from a nonoil trade surplus
and the financial account registered a surplus due to demand for sovereign debt securities. CPI
inflation has decelerated rapidly since October 2008 reflecting the weaker economic conditions
as well as falling commodity prices.

Macroeconomic policy responses have kept appropriate pace with the evolving economic
conditions. Bank Indonesia has been on a monetaty-easing cycle since December 2008,
consistent with lower inflationary pressures and slowing domestic demand. The policy rate has
been cut by 275 basis points to 6% percent. A fiscal stimulus package of about 1.4 percent of
GDP was announced in February 2009. The fiscal space for the stimulus was made possible by
solid performance over several years that has resulted in a decline in public debt. Moreover, the
flexible exchange rate has served well as an external shock absorber.

Banking and corporate sector indicators are generally robust, and have proved resilient to the
crisis. Financial soundness indicators improved in 2008-profitability rose and the capital base
strengthened further. Coming from a period of rapid credit growth in the last two years, and in
light of the uncertain economic climate, credit expansion has decelerated on a monthly basis
since December 2008. Indonesian companies have over time reduced their vulnerabilities,
including lowering leverage ratios, raising profrtability, and reducing their exposure to external
liabilities.

Executive Board Assessment

Executive Oirectors welcomed the resilience of the Indonesian economy, which owed much to
strong initial fundamentals and appropriate policy responses. Private consumption, supported
by the fiscal stimulus package, has kept growth positive and among the highest in the region.
The financial sector has recovered from the adverse initial impact of the global turmoil, and
investor sentiment has improved in recent months. Nevertheless, Directors noted that, although
the economic outlook for 2009 remains positive, another round of global risk aversion could
adversely affect external liquidity, demand, and growth prospects for Indonesia. It will therefore
be important that the authorities strive to achieve the appropriate policy mix, and promptly
adjust it as needed, to preserve macroeconomic and financial stability.

Directors welcomed the fiscal stimulus plan for 2009 and underscored that timely and efficient
implementationof the spending program, especially on infrastructure,would be critical to
sustaining the economic recovery. They considered it appropriate to maintain some of the
stimulus in 2010, given the available fiscal space. While some Directors pointed to financing
and capacity constraints, most saw room for a somewhat higher fiscal deficit than currently
planned, noting that such a level remains consistent with continued debt consolidation over the
medium term, an indication of the authorities' record of fiscal prudence.

                                                 3


Directors commended the authorities for the progress in fiscal reforms toward a consolidated
Treasury Single Account, simptifred budget execution procedures, and strengthened cash
management. They encouraged the authorities to build on the momentum of past reform efforts
to enhance budget flexibility and improve public resource management. Further strengthening
tax administration and IowerEng energy subsidies would help create fiscal space for priority
infrastructure and social expenditures.

Directors generally considered that the monetary policy easing since December 2008 was
timely and appropriate in the face of decelerating inflation and weakening investment. Going
forward, they supported a more cautious stance, given ample liquidity in the banking system,
long lags in monetary transmission, and the risk of a reversal of capital flows. Directors
encouraged the authorities to continue to strengthen the monetary policy framework. Strong
commitment to the medium-term inflation targets, as well as publication of inflation forecasts,
would help guide inflation expectations and enhance policy credibility.

Directors stressed that exchange rate flexibility has served the country well in recent months,
and remains an important shock absorber. They noted the staff's assessment that the current
level of the real effective exchange rate is broadly in line with fundamentals, and that reserves
are at a comfortable level. Most Directors considered it prudent nevertheless to build larger
reserve buffers gradually over the medium term to preserve investor confidence in the event
that global risk aversion deteriorates. Some others believed that the current level of reserves
and the various contingency arrangements should provide an adequate cushion.

Directors welcomed the robustness of the banking sector, with banks recording strong capital
positions and improved profitability. The crisis management measures recently introduced by
Bank t ndonesia have helped alleviate liquidity pressures and restore market confidence.
Directors looked foryvard to early parliamentary approval of the Financial Safety Net law, ulhich
would help strengthen the legal framework for bank resolution. They emphasized the
importance of a further strengthening of the early warning systems, and of continued close
supervision of banks, particularly small and medium-sizedbanks exposed to liquidity risk.
Directors looked forward to the forthcoming Financial Sector Assessment Program (FSAP) to
help identify priordies for further financial sector reform.

ANNEX 5: POVERTY AND SOCIAL IMPACTS

1. The positive impact on poor people o f policy reforms supported by the I D P L series can be
broadly categorized along two dimensions. First, by relieving infrastructure bottlenecks to
growth, reforms will increase average per capita incomes, including the incomes o f poor people.
Second, by increasing access to infrastructure, policy reforms supported under the I D P L are
likely to have a direct impact on the incomes (and broader quality o f life) o f poor people.
Caveats to this broadly positive picture concern the timing o f likely impact, negative externalities
o f infrastructure rollout likely to have a particular impact on the poor and possible reforms of
infrastructure pricing.

Current Status o f Infrastructure Services for the Poor

2.    While the country's underlying economic indicators are strong, and the poverty headcount
has fallen to the pre-crisis level, poverty reduction remains a critical challenge in Indonesia.
Today 16.5% o f the total population (and 20% o f the rural population) i s living under the poverty
line (set nationally at Rp.166,697, and Rp 146,837 in rural areas, per capita expenditure per
month). In addition, there are large regional disparities in the poverty level, with some districts
exhibiting poverty rates o f over 50%. Matching such disparities in income are disparities in
access to, and quality and price, o f infrastructure.

3,      While the proportion o f non-poor households with access to all-year passable asphalt roads
i s 75.9%, only 60.9% o f poor households have access to such roads. The problem i s particularly
acute for the rural poor, where only 53.0% o f poor households have access to all-year passable
asphalt roadsmgAccording to the 2005 PODES village survey, only 60% o f all villages have
access to asphalt roads (Table One). Furthermore, lack o f road maintenance, particularly in rural
areas, i s a considerable issue in this sector. While the national road network i s in good condition,
with 95% paved and 88% in good to fair condition, much o f the district and village road network
(that most used by rural poor) i s in poor to bad condition. This has a significant effect on the
livelihoods o f poor people and access to services such as education and health care.

4.    Access to water and sanitation infrastructure services in Indonesia i s currently highly
regressive (Table Two). Over one half o f poor households lack access to sanitation (compared to
under a third o f non-poor households). Again, over one half o f poor households lack access to
safe water, compared to 42% o f the non-poor. Preliminary analysis o f 2007 data suggests that
only 17% o f the population has access to piped water, from P D A M and other sources. O f the
households that have access to safe water, 52% have individual privately owned sources of
drinking water (pump or well), and 25% have a jointly owned source (communal tap). Indonesia
has one o f the highest rates o f self-supplied water at both the individual and community level.
Thus the majority o f the population i s "self-provisioning".

5.    Twenty-five percent o f households pay for water, including both piped water and other
sources (vendors, etc). The average price o f water piped from plant (2004 cost inflated to 2006
prices) i s Rp. 1,500/m3. This varies from one area to the next, ranging from Rp. 340 (Lombok) to
a high o f Rp 4,367 (Jakarta), as does the cost o f household connections which range from Rp.
300,000 to Rp. 1,000,000 (Jakarta) - see Tables Three and Four. Water companies are
subsidized and the average level o f cost recovery i s 80%. Water piped from other sources costs

an average o f Rp. 21,200, water purchased from vendors costs Rp 47,700/m3, packaged or bottled
water costs Rp. 326,600/m3. Given the concentration o f piped (from plant) water provision
amongst wealthier urban households these water tariffs are highly regressive in impact.

6.    Rather than use vendors, most households haul water themselves. Their cost o f supply i s
accounted for by the time taken to collect water. Nationally, 64% o f households hauling water
spend 5 minutes or less to access water for daily use, 29% spend between 5 and 29 minutes, and
8% spend 30 minutes or more. Having to haul water has a dramatic impact on usage. Nationally
households with access to piped water use 11 times more water than those without access. This i s
even more marked for poor and rural households: those with access to piped water use up to 25
times more water than those with no access, which has significant health and sanitation
implications.

7. Official household access to electricity was 55% in 2005, although informal connections
are common, raising access rates." According to the 2007 Susenas, 88% o f the population has
access to P L N electricity, 90% o f the non-poor and 77% o f the poor. Approximately 3 to 4% o f
the PLN-unserved population (mostly in rural areas) use non-PLN electricity and the rest use
energy from other sources. There i s a big gap in the level o f usage between different types o f
household: urban households use on average 60% more electricity than rural households, and the
poor use 64% less than do non poor households. Average monthly expenditure on P L N
electricity for poor households i s Rp. 18,699, compared to Rp. 47,380 for non poor households
(Data from the 2007 Susenas).

8.     The Bank's report Electricity for All suggests that in 2006, people in rural areas outside o f
Java-Bali were paying an average o f about $2/month on energy. Poor households were on
average using about 40KwWmonth o f electricity. Full cost recovery for 40KwWmonth outside
o f Java-Bali was estimated at $6/month. More generally, P L N estimates that the average small
household consumer (Rl, 450VA) sees subsidies which account for 40% o f supply cost. In the
absence o f a breakdown quintile o f the R1/450VA sub-category, we can assume that o f all the
P L N customers these would be the poorest. Thus reducing R 1 subsidies would have a regressive
effect."

The Poverty Impact o f Reforms Supported under the IDPL Series

9.    All o f the reforms embodied in the I D P L are intended to support economic growth and
aggregate welfare through improvements in the quality, efficiency and reach o f infrastructure
provision. In particular, a key objective o f the I D P L series i s to restore national infrastructure
expenditure to a more appropriate level. Previous analytical work by the World Bank has
suggested that inadequate investment in infrastructure i s already acting as a bottleneck to growth,
so that increased investment could be expected to give a substantial boost to GDP (Box 1).

10. Prior to the crisis, the poverty elasticity o f growth i s estimated to have varied between
-0.81 (1987-90) and -2.60 (1984-1987). As o f 2004 the poverty elasticity o f growth was -2.1 (See
Table Five). Conservatively assuming that infrastructure investment i s a comparatively
inequitable source o f growth, a 2.4% increase in GDP per capita associated with improved
performance o f infrastructure sectors would s t i l l be associated with a decline in the poverty index
by more than 2%.

 11. In fact, previous analytical work by the Bank has suggested that infrastructure has
traditionally been an important part o f equitable, or pro-poor, growth in the country. Making the
New Indonesia Workfor the Poor notes that "from 1970 onwards, large and sustained reductions
in poverty in Indonesia have only occurred during periods o f sustained economic growth.. the        .
pro-poor performance for these three decades was based on a conscious strategy that                      ...
integrated the macroeconomy with the household economy by lowering the transactions costs of
operating in markets.. ... transaction costs fell markedly through the construction o f roads and
other infrastructure that enabled the poor to be connected to the growth process.. ." Analysis by
the ADB suggests a similar result for electricity, and that a 1.0% increase in government
investment in roads i s associated with a decline in poverty by 0.3% over five years (the largest
impact o f any government investment).'*

12. Before the crisis, growth in Indonesia was considerably more pro-poor than it has been
recently. Between 1980 and 1999, the bottom quintile o f the income distribution saw
consumption rise at rates faster than average. Since the crisis, the bottom quintile has seen
considerably slower than average income growth.13 A number o f factors account for this change

                             Annex 5: Poverty and Social Impacts


including stagnant employment growth, high food prices and an extremely sluggish performance
in agriculture.

 13. The poverty elasticity o f growth i s significantly lower in rural regions o f Indonesia than in
urbanized regions (-0.5 in Papua compared to -2.5 in Java/Bali, for example). Declining
expenditure on maintenance o f and investment in infrastructure may have played some role in
slowing agricultural growth and reducing the ability o f rural people to benefit from continued
growth in services - increasing transport costs faced by farmers and consumers as well as
reducing access to markets. Prior to the 1997 crisis, over 7% o f GDP was spent on infrastructure
investment. By 1999, this had declined to closer to 3%, where it has remained. The Bank's
recent Rural Investment Climate Assessment found evidence o f drastic underinvestment in road
maintenance and rapidly declining road quality in the period since 1999. National figures
suggest that between 2000 and 2006, the percentage o f national and provincial roads in good or
fair condition has fallen 16% and 26%, respectively. A return to higher investment and
maintenance expenditure in infrastructure may be one factor in restoring the pro-poor impact o f
growth.

14. International experience also indicates strong direct linkages between infrastructure service
provision and poverty reduction. Reliable, affordable and cost-effective provision o f
infrastructure services can help in improving health and education outcomes (reducing levels o f
child mortality from water borne diseases, respiratory illnesses, better access to schools and
clinics) and indirectly in reducing the fiscal burden o f governments to create space for other
expenditures. Improved access to reliable infrastructure services can also increase the general
welfare o f poor households through reductions in the opportunity costs (both time and money)
associated with finding imperfect alternatives to meet essential needs.

 15. Indonesian experience matches this international pattern. Making the New Indonesia Work
for the Poor suggests that better access to roads and telecommunications "are associated with
 significantly lower poverty." Access to an all-year passable road i s associated with a 7.7%
 increase in consumption in urban areas and a 3.1% increase in rural areas. This i s even higher
 for certain areas such as Papua where it reaches over 20%.

16. Better quality improves the pro-poor impact o f infrastructure. Improved quality roads,
measured by a proxy o f higher average speed traveled between village and provincial capital,
raises per capita expenditure, with an elasticity o f 0.06. Infrastructure can have a particularly
dramatic effect on non-farm earnings in rural areas. The Bank's Rural Investment Climate
Assessment concluded that the percentage o f rural household income derived from non-farm
enterprises was more than twice as high in villages where there were no blackouts as in villages
suffering blackouts more than weekly. And non-farm income was more than twice as high in
villages with a concrete or asphalt road as in those connected only by a dirt road (See Figure 1 on
constraints to rural enterprise identified by surveyed entrepreneurs).

17. The costs o f inadequate water and sanitation are substantial and the health and
environmental costs in cities are especially high. Considering those 70 million people who use
and share public and other non-private forms o f sanitation facilities, it i s estimated that the cost
o f poor sanitation Cjust measured by waiting and walking time) i s in the order o f Rp 530,000
(US$56) per person per year, or almost 2.6% o f GDP.14 Overwhelmingly, poor people do not

have access to networked water and sanitation. They pay considerably more than networked
consumers per liter o f water. And they do not benefit at all from a system that starves PDAMs o f
investment resources in order to subsidize consumption. A redirection o f subsidies from
consumption to rollout would be overwhelmingly pro-poor.

18. A recent survey o f those currently without access to electricity reported that 87%
mentioned the high cost o f connection as a barrier to access compared to 4% who mentioned
high monthly bills." And existing consumption subsidies favor the wealthy connected over the
poor. In 2005, the Government provided Rp. 11 trillion o f subsidies to the electricity industry.
Because o f differential access and lower levels o f usage, the poorest 10% o f Indonesians
benefited from an estimated Rp. 900 billion o f subsidies, while the richest 10% received Rp. 1.3
trillion. As with water, redirecting consumption subsidies to rollout and supply regularization
would be overwhelmingly pro-poor.

19. Reforms supported by the I D P L will play a role in extending access, through increasing
infrastructure investment at the national and local level. Several I D P L reforms are focused on
supporting the government's strategy to increase household access t o quality services, including
rural electrification and access to piped water. Network expansion will reduce the regressive
quality o f existing infrastructure access, although international experience suggests that the
poorest sections o f the community are usually the last to be connected. Policies addressing sub-
national governments' incentives to invest in infrastructure may also, in time, improve the
provision o f rural roads. And support for more rational pricing should help target (needed)
subsidies at those households that are most in need -first, those unconnected to networked
services and, second, the connected poor.

Caveats -Potential Negative Impacts o f Infrastructure Reform and Investment

20. Caveats are necessary to this broadly positive picture. First, the welfare effects o f many o f
the I D P L policy reforms are likely to take a decade or more to be realized. While it i s to be hoped
that improved maintenance supported by better planning and operations may help preserve the
quality o f infrastructure over the short term, many o f the policies supported by the series are
intended to improve governance over the next few years, which will induce new investment
plans, which in turn will induce infrastructure construction. The process o f construction may
yield some benefits in terms o f employment alongside some social dislocation. But only when
construction o f new infrastructure i s completed do the full benefits begin to be realized.

2 1. A second caveat regards potential negative impacts o f infrastructure expansion.
Notwithstanding the many social benefits o f improved infrastructure, there may be some social
costs associated with expanded infrastructure investment. The negative externalities o f expanded
infrastructure reach and use often fall disproportionately on the poor. Poor people suffer from
the impacts o f related pollution (including particulate and N O x exposure from transport and
energy) as well as from traffic accidents (see B o x 2).

Box 2: Traffic Accidents
Indonesia i s experiencing a growing road safety problem with 30,000 fatalities occurring
annually, and an estimated annual level o f injury above 1,000,000. With rapidly growing
motorisation, mainly through motorcycling, this situation i s highly likely to deteriorate further in
the immediate future and with further road construction. Fatality rates per 10,000 vehicles in
2004 were 8 times higher in Indonesia than in Australia, and more than twice the level in
Malaysia. 90% o f all road casualties in Indonesia are in the economically productive 15 to 50
year old age group. Total annual costs o f road crashes in Indonesia (in 2002) are estimated at Rp.
35 trillion, corresponding to 1.9% o f GDP and 9.9% o f the value o f total national expenditure on
investment in physical assets.

22. Land acquisition associated with road construction may have adverse social consequences.
Regarding land acquisition in particular, Indonesia's current standards o f compensation do not
meet World Bank standards, particularly in respect o f loss o f livelihood. Furthermore, even land
acquisition under World Bank projects has had a mixed impact (Box 3). Indonesia's land
acquisition systems do to provide compensation for relocation to those without formal title. The
I D P L reforms which envisage improved compensation standards may help to mitigate the
adverse social consequences.

Box 3: Land Acquisition and Relocation
A review o f the land acquisition and resettlement operations associated with the World Bank's
Indonesian lending operations found that during F O - FY04, the portfolio had 15 projects
                                                    Y O
involving land acquisition and resettlement, which affected approximately 20,000 households.
Urban and transport sector projects accounted for nearly 85% o f the affected households. Almost
all projects that involved resettlement were sectoral investment projects, which typically
consisted o f large number o f subprojects with relatively small, localized resettlement impacts. A
larger proportion o f affected households were urban households engaged in petty business,
artisan trade and unskilled labor. Common resettlement measures consisted primarily o f cash
compensation for acquired land and replacement housing in case o f displacement. Follow-up
review found that nearly two thirds o f the households moved to relocation areas moved out of
these sites eventually for want o f livelihood opportunities.

23.   A third, but only partial, caveat regards pricing reform. Given the cost o f a piped water
connection, piped water may not be an economically feasible option for the poorest rural
households even if investment levels increase and prices are rebalanced from connection charges
towards usage charges. The average household expenditure per month i s Rp. 1,470,287; the
current cost o f connection for piped water can range from Rp. 300,000 to Rp. 750,000,
representing up to half the average monthly consumption for the average household. For the
poorest quintile, whose average monthly consumption i s Rp. 6 18,186, these fees are prohibitively
high.

24.    The timing o f changes, if any, to electricity subsidies and pricing has not been specified in
the I D P L reforms, but measures calling for their review have been included. This i s with the aim
o f reducing their regressive impact. Upward electricity tariff revisions would adversely affect
those who already have connections, but would help to expand the rate o f connection,


                                                                                                  90
                                   Annex 5: Poverty and Social Impacts


particularly in the eastern provinces where poverty rates tend to be higher. Over the coming 4 to
5 years, the Government i s committed to expanding access to new users, in particular
households, and to streamlining the tariff structure with a view towards gradually increasing
tariffs on a sliding scale for each category of user (ie the lowest level household users will only
see on average smaller incremental quarterly increases than higher level users, starting in 201 1.)

25. Indonesia demonstrated its capacity to divert spending from regressive pricing subsidies to
pro-poor expenditure with the reduction of f u e l subsides in 2005 (See Figure Two). The
government reallocated a total of US$1.7 billion in 2005 away from the regressive f u e l subsidy
to pro-poor sectors and programs with better-founded development objectives (the PKPS-BBM
programs). A similarly motivated effort to further reduce fuel subsidies and/or to retarget
electricity subsidies could have a similarly dramatic impact on poverty.

ANNEX 6: ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACTS

1. The I D P L program promotes policies and institutional structures that will contribute in the
medium term to infrastructure investment. Though infrastructure investment can have environmental
consequences, the main purpose o f the I D P L engagement i s to improve the management and
promotion o f investment in the types o f infrastructure needed to increase growth, reduce poverty, and
increase service delivery and household access to infrastructure services.

2. I t i s not possible to identify precise environmental effects o f the policies recognized in the I D P L
program. Some policies designed to increase infrastructure investment will have positive
environmental and health outcomes (e.g., water and sanitation facilities, better solid waste
management, policy changes in pricing o f fuel and power that encourage conservation and efficiency).
Other policies intended to increase access to infrastructure services may have negative effects for the
environment (eg roads and power plants). S t i l l other policies directly target the Government's
capacity to manage environmental impacts o f infrastructure service delivery (eg. revisions to
environmental impact assessment legislation). In most cases it will take the best part o f a decade for
policies that are designed to increase infrastructure investment to flow through into new investment
plans, construction and operation o f facilities, and for environmental consequences to be felt.

3.     Nevertheless, if the I D P L program i s successful it i s likely that individual policies will have
significant environmental effects, both positive and negative. The I D P L policies - including policies
that address national government, sub-national government, and the private sector - are focused
particularly on four infrastructure sectors: energy, roads, water and sanitation, and solid waste. The
I D P L series also contains policy reforms expected to strengthen some key GO1 environmental
policies, including the environmental impact assessment (AMDAL) process and municipal solid
waste management. The following discussion describes the nature o f these potential effects, and
reviews the Government's capacity to deal with these effects, and the measures being put in place to
strengthen this capacity. l6

Increased electricity investment

4.    The Government's energy plans include increased investment in electricity generating capacity,
with likely negative consequences in respect o f climate change and other more local effects. The
Government's current plan i s to increase reliance on coal over 20 years, from 24% to 30% o f total
energy use, and to expand the use o f biofuels from 1.3% to 5% o f total energy use. Increased
domestic coal consumption may contribute to air pollution, including COz (global warming) and SO2
(acid rain) emissions, and has the potential to lead to more extensive strip mining - affecting
threatened forests in Kalimantan and Sumatra. A major expansion o f production o f biofuels could
lead to more conversion o f forest area into o i l palm plantations.

5.     The Government recognizes the challenges created by climate change and has shown high
political commitment for successful climate change actions. The President o f Indonesia has expressed
commitment to climate change action at international venues in 2007. Indonesia has also achieved

specific country policies supported by the operation are likely to cause significant effects on the country's
environment, forests, and other natural resources. For country policies with likely significant effects, the Bank
assesses in the Program Document the borrower's systems for reducing such adverse effects and enhancing
positive effects, drawing on relevant country-level or sectoral environmental analysis. If there are significant gaps
in the analysis or shortcomings in the borrower's systems, the Bank describes in the Program Document how
such gaps or shortcomings would be addressed before or during program implementation, as appropriate.

                                                                             N
global visibility by presiding over the Conference o f the Parties o f the U Framework Convention on
Climate Change in Bali in 2007, as a leader o f the troika countries in the negotiating process up to
20 12, as a founder o f the Forest-1 1, and as a leader in the global Finance Ministers' dialogue process.
The Government has developed two programmatic documents on climate change: a National Action
Plan Addressing Climate Change (December 2007) and the Development Planning Response to
Climate Change (final version, June 2008). The Government also formed a National Commission on
Climate Change in July 2008, headed by the President and involving 15 key ministries. The new
institutions and policies that are emerging from the new focus on climate change could lead to a
reconsideration o f the energy policies noted above.

6. In terms o f measures specifically addressing Indonesia's f u e l mix in electricity generation, the
Government i s encouraging the connection o f natural gas pipelines to existing combined cycle gas
turbine plants, which will reduce greenhouse gas emissions by permitting substitution away from
current diesel fuel. The Bank i s preparing an investment project aimed at showcasing developments
in geothermal energy, which could play a significant role in Indonesia's electricity supply and would
also contribute to reduced greenhouse emissions. Indonesia i s a non-Annex 1 country and has no
greenhouse gas emissions reductions targets under the current international climate regime.

Reduced electricity subsidies

7 . Through increased transparency concerning the costs and benefits o f current pricing policies,
the I D P L program encourages the Government to consider reducing electricity subsidies. Reduced
energy subsidies would restrain the growth o f energy demand, reducing the need for investment and
hence mitigating the negative consequences o f electricity investment outlined above.

8. Higher o i l and electricity prices could induce household and industrial consumers to switch to
other energy sources, with both positive and negative environmental consequences. Analysis o f the
consequences o f the 2005 reductions in o i l subsidies, prepared for D P L 3, suggested:
    0   Lower overall consumption o f petroleum based fuel (10- 15%) by households, transport and
        industry, implying a reduction in air pollution;
    0   Only minor effects on overall economic growth, meaning any reduction in industrial timber
        demand would be insignificant.
    0   Some f u e l switching and more active consideration o f alternative fuels for the future, possibly
        leading to more fuel efficient technologies and lower growth o f fuel demand.
    0   A trebling o f the price for kerosene (the main energy source for cooking) reduced
        consumption by 13%, comparable with annual demand fluctuations attributable to other
        causes. Even if there were significant switching into fuel wood in rural areas, the FA0 and
        CIFOR have studied the issue intensively since the 1970s and concluded that fuel wood i s not
        a significant driver o f deforestation or land use change.
    0   Industrial fuel switching away from o i l could lead to substitution towards coal (with negative
        consequences) or towards natural gas (with positive consequences). In the short term,
        industrial f u e l consumers, including P L N and other electricity generators, were constrained in
        their ability to switch fuel sources. In the longer term, Indonesia i s increasing i t s reliance on
        coal.

9. The fuel substitution effects o f higher electricity prices can be analyzed along similar lines to
the higher o i l prices examined in D P L 3. Overall, the environmental consequences o f higher
electricity prices are likely to be dominated by the positive effects o f reduced growth o f electricity
demand.




                                                                                                        97
                                 Annex 6: EnvironmentalImpacts
Increased Roads Investment

10. Increased road investment i s likely to contribute to increased vehicle use, and increased air
pollution, particularly in urban centers. Air pollution's annual costs have been calculated at $500
million in Jakarta and $100 million in Surabaya. These costs are typically borne disproportionately by
low income groups who are more likely to be exposed to pollution and less likely to be able to afford
mitigating measures.

11. Indonesia's vehicle fleet i s one o f the major contributors to air pollution, with energy
production, industry, and forest fires constituting other important sources. Recent analysis o f
Jakarta's air indicated significant levels o f lead, suspended particulates (soot, smoke dust and liquid
droplets), carbon monoxide, carbon dioxide, nitrogen dioxide, and sulfur dioxide. The City o f Jakarta
has several initiatives aimed at improving air quality, including the use o f compressed natural gas in
buses, conversion o f the city's tuk tuk fleet to compressed natural gas, promotion o f public transport,
and development o f sidewalks to promote walking for short distance travel. At the national level,
Indonesia has adopted an array o f legislation addressing air pollution, including emissions standards
for vehicles, but enforcement o f these standards i s weak. Happily, the use o f lead in petrol was finally
ended in 2007. The significant reductions in fuel subsidies, in 2005 and 2008 are also important in
terms o f slowing the growth o f vehicle emissions.

12. The World Bank has recently conducted an "Analysis o f Fuel Quality and Air Pollution Issues
in the Road Transportation Sector". The analysis identified six policy options for reducing air
pollution and greenhouse gas emissions, o f which three were studied in detail: improvement o f fuel
quality to meet Euro fuel standards; revitalization o f compressed natural gas use; and provision o f tax
incentives for fuel-efficient vehicles. Cost-benefit analysis suggested that a combination o f tax
incentives and improved fuel standards would yield the highest net benefits. The World Bank's
engagement in this area i s continuing with a further study underway on emissions reduction
opportunities and policies in the manufacturing sector.

13. Increased road investment will also include new road construction, and will result in associated
project-specific environmental impacts. The strength o f Indonesia's systems for management o f such
impacts i s discussed below under AMDAL and the improvements in the law that will make these
project specific impacts easier to manage and mitigate. Environmental standards for national roads
projects o f the Ministry o f Public Works have recently been improved to address matters such as the
siting o f workers' camps in forests, removal and replacement o f trees, specifications for quarries,
washing roads works vehicles near rivers, etc.

 14. New or improved roads can also increase access to fragile habitats such as natural forests,
contributing to their degradation. Assistance i s being provided to the Ministry o f Forestry to improve
forest monitoring and the transparency o f information. Both measures can help to better plan roads so
that they minimize conflict with forest management. In addition, the Aceh Forest and Environment
Project i s providing information to the reconstruction process concerning possible negative impacts o f
road-building as well as alternative routes.

Increased Investment in Water and Sanitation

15. Poor P D A M performance has contributed to excessive reliance on private wells, and excessive
groundwater extraction and subsidence in parts o f Indonesia. L o w rates o f sewerage and sanitation
coverage cause widespread contamination o f surface and groundwater. As a result, Indonesia has
experienced repeated local epidemics o f gastrointestinal infections and has the highest incidence o f



                                                                                                       98

typhoid in Asia. Economic losses attributable to poor sanitation are conservatively estimated at 2% o f
GDP."

16. The I D P L program seeks to create the conditions for increased investment in water and
sanitation, which will have positive environmental consequences as well as positive implications for
people's health. International experience suggests that PDAMs will need to improve their financial
situation through increased sales o f piped water before major progress will be made in addressing
sanitation.

Improved Solid Waste Management

 17. The I D P L program recognizes the national Government's initiatives to improve municipal solid
waste management. Indonesia's largely uncontrolled disposal o f solid waste has become a growing
threat to the quality o f water, air, and land. Informal dumps contaminate surface and ground waters,
and encourage pests and pathogens that spread communicable disease. This threat i s compounded by
the lack o f environmentally sound waste disposal and treatment facilities. The Government's new
municipal solid waste management law, and the associated "socialization" and capacity building by
the Ministry o f Environment are important efforts to reduce these sources o f pollution,

The Government's systems for Managing Environmental Impacts

18. The Government's annual work plan includes the environmental actions to be addressed in each
budget cycle. Some o f the items mentioned include development o f debt for nature swaps, reducing
environmental pollution, reducing smoke and haze from forest and land fires, national movement for
the rehabilitation o f forests and degraded lands, conservation o f natural resources, improving
environmental management through the spatial planning process and developing environmental data
and information. These goals are backed by an increasing financial commitment to environmental
actions (Table 1).

19. Among government ministries, the Ministry o f Public Works i s responsible for the greatest
infrastructure activity. The Directorate General o f Highways, within MPW, has established an
environmental unit to ensure appropriate treatment o f environmental issues in road planning and
construction.

20. A Special Allocation Fund (DAK) for Environment was instituted in 2006, providing fiscal
transfers to sub-national governments for environmental initiatives. Funding nearly tripled in 2007 to
Rp. 3 52 billion, indicating the Government's commitment to improving environmental outcomes.

21. The Government has prepared draft legislation, which will amend and improve the existing
Environmental Management Law. The new legislation i s a trigger for I D P L 3. The amendments
address matters including:
        Standards and rules for ambient air and water quality, emission and effluent quality,
        environmental impact assessment, business licensing and environmental management
        documentation, and environmental investigations;
    0   Roles and responsibilities o f central and sub-national governments;
        Rights o f communities and environmental organizations to make allegations and request
        investigations;
    0   Implementation o f environmental management and monitoring o f businesses;
        Sanctions for violations related to contamination o f the environment, the environmental
        impact assessment process, or business license conditions.

22. Environmental impact assessment i s critical in planning new infrastructure, and in managing the
environmental consequences o f construction and operation o f infrastructure. The World Bank has
supported the Ministry o f Environment in analyzing the strengths and weaknesses o f Indonesia's
existing impact assessment regime, known as AMDAL. Focusing on the AMDAL elements o f the
new legislation, the proposed amendments would include:
        Changing the requirement for assessment from projects above a certain financial size to
        projects which would have a significant environmental impact.
        A requirement that every business that i s expected to generate significant environmental
        impacts should conduct an environmental impact assessment to obtain a business license.
        A requirement that environmental mitigation measures identified in the AMDAL, and the
        follow-on management and monitoring plans must be included as conditions in business
        licenses.
        Authority for civil servant investigations including monitoring and inspection, and ability to
        report violations directly to a prosecutor, rather than going via the police as i s currently
        required.
        Sanctions for the violations o f environment elements o f business licenses or breach o f
        AMDAL process requirements, including j a i l terms and fines (eg. 6 months and/or Rp. 1
        billion (US$ 100,000) for carrying on a business without having conducted a necessary
        AMDAL).

23.   The Ministry o f Environment i s also engaged in measures to improve the capacity o f sub-
national environmental agencies responsible for conducting AMDALs. Measures include:
        Conducting surveys to examine the quality o f assessments prepared by these agencies;
        "Socializing" (ie publicizing to relevant stakeholders) the regulatory framework for
        decentralized AMDAL;
        Providing training and certification for environmental assessors;
        Developing the roles and functions o f local governments, and developing a code o f conduct
        for interactions between local councils and civil society; and


                                                                                                 100
                               Annex 6: EnvironmentalImpacts
        Building a new system of fiscal transfers including accountability and transparency in the
        Kabupaten budget and an open inclusiveprocess for its formulation and implementation.

24. The Bank has recently prepared a Country Environmental Analysis to strengthen the Bank's
understanding o f environment and natural resource management challenges, and propose specific
recommendations on how to achieve more effective results. Part of this analysis has already included
a review o f the Government's and donors' priorities and activities. Further analysis i s required to
determine whether the environment and natural resource categories that obtain most funding are the
sectors most in need of funding. The workplan for the CEA has been discussed in a stakeholder
workshop. I t i s intended that this work will be completed during FY09.

Baseline:                        Limited actions to address existing AMDAL known weaknesses, and
                                 lack o f technical and financial capacity for review, approval and
                                 monitoring o f AMDAL functions at local level.
Latest information:              The Ministry o f Environment i s undertaking several measures to
                                 improve the quality o f AMDAL reviews undertaken by local
                                 governments:

Indicator 11:             Decline in the open-dump disposal o f solid waste (MoE).
Baseline:                 Open dump waste disposal i s 53% in large and medium cities and 85%
                          in small cities.
Latest information:       The IDPL 3 team has not been able to verify the baseline specified in
                          IDPL 1, The Ministry o f Environment currently reports that 90% o f
                          cities use open dumping. Nevertheless, the Ministry o f Environment
                          indicates that open dumping will be eliminated within 5 years, so that
                          there i s likely to be clear evidence o f satisfaction o f the target indicator
                          by the end o f 2010. The Ministry defines open dumping by reference to
                          UNEP classification, having regard to a range o f factors. These factors
                          are reflected in Adapura ratings which are reported annually by the
                          Ministry o f Environment, and which may serve as a useful indicator o f
                          progress towards the target indicator. Adapura ratings assess landfills on
                          the presence o f various physical indicators, such as whether there are
                          facilities for leachate treatment, whether there are monitoring wells to
                          assess the quality o f water flowing underneath city dumps, whether
                          different sorts o f waste are placed in different zones within the dump,
                          etc. Higher scores indicate improvements.

ANNEX 8: PUBLIC FINANCIAL MANAGEMENT


                           I. Background and Analytical Underpinnings

1. The IDPL 3 operation will provide general budget support to the Indonesian Government and
will be executed through i t s public financial management systems. With a view to assess the attendant
fiduciary risks and proceeds o f this development loan, this annex summarizes the current state of
these systems, maps the reforms efforts being conducted, and provides an outlook with regards to
overcoming current reform challenges.

2.      Public Financial Management reform, as previously outlined in the 2001 White Paper,
continues to be at the center of attention o f Indonesian policy-makers, with the global economic
downturn having added further urgency to the agenda: Indonesia anticipates a substantial reduction in
both tax revenues and foreign exchange reserves resulting from the pending trade deficit. The
exchange rate has weakened, driving up the cost of foreign debt servicing, and the unemployment rate
i s likely to increase, which will adversely impact the poverty rate.

3.     The wave of crisis i s fortunately tempered by a decline o f world oil prices. The decrease in oil
prices has resulted in a reduction of o i l subsidy, and thus provided more fiscal space in the budget for
the fiscal stimulus necessary to counter the effects o f the global economic downturn. Also, as a result
o f the ongoing efforts among Indonesian key stakeholders, well-sustained reforms have mitigated the
impact of this downturn on the country's economy. Nonetheless, PFM systems in the country now
face unprecedented challenges to ensure efficient and effective budget allocations and disbursements,
in line with the policy responses to the global and domestic economic turmoil.

4.    In face o f these challenges, the commitment o f key stakeholders in the budget process to
vigorously pursue the reform agenda remains unwavering and strong. The evolving agenda continues
to be broad-based, comprising (i)improving results-orientation in state budget planning and
development, (ii)   improving budget and treasury management, (iii)   strengthening monitoring and
evaluation of public expenditures and programs, (iv) improving the public procurement systems, and
(v) improving Government accounting and audit functions. In sum, the agenda i s designed to improve
how revenues are raised, how funds are allocated, used, and accounted for - both at the central and at
the regional level.

5.    IDPL 3 operates in tandem with the separate macroeconomic DPL series. DPLs 1-5 have had
public financial management as an area of focus and have contributed to many of the significant
improvements made in the past few years. With PFM improvement remaining one key focus also for
DPL 6, this loan will be an equally crucial instrument for the Government to flexibly, and in a self-
determined fashion, underpin and flank i t s reform targets. The priority policy actions related to the
area are discussed in detail in the DPL 6 program document.

6.   The subsequent assessment draws on recent economic and sector work undertaken by the World
Bank and other development partners. The assessment also draws on the ongoing policy dialogue and
advisory services providedthrough the GFMRAP and the associated PFM Multi-Donor Trust Fund.

              1 . Reform Priorities: Achievements, Challenges & the Way Forward
               1

            1. Improving Results-Orientationin State Budget Planning and Development

7. To facilitate policy-based budgeting, the Indonesian Government continues to prioritize the
implementation of Performance-Based Budgeting (PBB) and the Medium Term Expenditure
Framework (MTEF). MoF and BAPPENAS have been working together in developing a road map for
the implementationof PBB in Indonesia starting from FY 2009 as required in the State Finance Law.

8.     Based on the PFM reform framework as legislated, they have started revising the existing
program structure used for planning and budgeting purposes to align programs with organizational
structures and with the development agenda defined in the RPJM. The new program structure will be
incorporated in the next RPJM for 2010-14, and i s intended to be used during 2010 for the budget
preparation process of FY 20 11. For the past years, the existing RPJM (2004-09) has been further
elaborated through the annual work plan (RKP) process which guides aggregate allocations in the
state budget. This has contributed to improving the coherence of policies and priorities, and their
alignment with the state budget.

9.    Budget submission templates (RKA-KL) are currently being revised in order to simplify budget
submissions and link them more closely to programs. A Planning and Budgeting Reform Manual on
Program Restructuring, MTEF and PBB has been finalized by DG Budget and BAPPENAS, and has
been issued under a circular signed jointly by the Minister of Finance and the Minister for
BAPPENAS. The contents and procedures of this manual are now being socialized to all the budget
holders. It i s anticipated that the reforms prescribed in the manual will be implemented in the 201 1
budget preparation process. Forward estimates at the aggregate level, based on MTEF, were
introduced in the 2008 and 2009 state budget.

10. MoF i s also in the process o f building its capacity to manage strategic performance management
based on the Balanced Scorecard (BSC) performance management tool. The possibility of interfacing
some BSC indicators with corresponding PBB indicators being developed to monitor and evaluate
program implementationi s being explored.

11. Generally, there i s still a need to deepen and sustain the momentum in Indonesia's budget
system reforms. The continuing objective i s to establish a results-based orientation in state budget
planning and development, and to ensure closer linkage between policy, planning and budgeting in
accordance with the intent of the Law on State Finances. To this end, the Government's capability in
assessing the impact o f alternative policy decisions on key economic and fiscal indicators, including
strengthening o f the system for managing data and statistics, needs to be further enhanced. Also, staff
in various ministries requires more training and orientation regarding PBB and MTEF
implementation.

 12. In terms of legislative oversight, the Parliament's (DPR) role in shaping the state budget and
fiscal policy has been institutionalized by law, and the capacity of the DPR budget committee in
examining detailed budget allocations with respect to macro-economic framework and fiscal policies
i s being strengthened. Also, budget documentation has significantly improved. The Budget
Commission in DPR i s currently discussing proposals for the enactment o f a new law on "The Role
and Authority o f `DPR (Susduk)" which includes the institutionalization o f a Parliamentary Budget
Office. .

13. However, the DPR continues to face a number of structural challenges particularly in the areas
      building independent support and research capacity to support legislative budget review; (ii)
of: (i)

                                                                                                   109
                             Annex 8: Public Financial Management
general capacity development in budget analysis and oversight including familiarity with PBB and
MTEF; and (iii)   follow up o f external audit findings to ensure that the executive i s held accountable
for transparent and efficient budget execution. Capacity-building o f DPR i s thus to remain an
important pillar in the reform-framework.

                            2. Improving Budget and Treasury Management

14. Though significant advances have been made in the budget preparation side, actual expenditures
continue to deviate from plan. Indonesia thus remains committed to smoothing budget implementation
and execution through modernization o f the treasury system. Most o f the regulations to support the
implementation o f the State Treasury Law o f 2004 have been established while others are being
finalized. The design and implementation o f an automated treasury payment and budget preparation
system (Sistem Perbendaharaan dan Anggaran Negara, or SPAN) i s in hand. SPAN, as a cross-cutting
reform, will increase the timeliness, reliability and transparency o f budget disbursement and reporting
as well as improve the capability o f managers in the efficient management o f public resources.
Business process improvements in the area o f budget formulation and budget execution have started
and are expected to be completed within the next 18 months. The change management aspects related
to the implementation o f SPAN will be addressed from early 2010 till the completion o f the pilot
phase. The SPAN turnkey implementation vendor has been selected and the contract signed on July
10th 2009.

15. A new Treasury Transformation Directorate, which will focus on SPAN implementation, has
been established. Ministerial decrees establishing a project governance system for SPAN have been
issued. SPAN i s projected to become operational in the central treasury beginning 2011, and then
rolled out to the KPPNs and pilot line ministries starting 2012. I t will then replace the multitude of
financial data processing applications currently used by Government institutions.

16. Latest challenges for M o F in the SPAN implementation process include a review and
reformulating o f the chart o f accounts and the strengthening o f PUSINTEK's capability to serve as a
central I C T services provider for SPAN. The capacity building needs for both preparatory and
implementation activities under SPAN will thus be considerable, and tapping o f advisory services to
facilitate the implementation o f treasury reforms in general, and SPAN in particular, will be
necessary. Also, there i s a recognized priority for building the capacity on accounting standards,
including migration to accrual accounting and related requirements for training o f staff.

 17. Cash management has improved significantly with the continued implementation o f the
Treasury Single Account (TSA), and since 2007 the TSA for expenditure management has been made
operational in all M o F Treasury offices. An annual census o f Government bank accounts had revealed
that a large number o f accounts were s t i l l outside the coverage o f the TSA, and the TSA arrangement
also did not adequately cover bank accounts used for revenue collection. However, extension o f the
TSA to cover revenue bank accounts i s expected to be rolled out from July 2009 to January 2010. A
staged implementation o f this reform has started with collecting bank branches in the Central region
followed by the Western, and Eastern regions. M o F and BI have already signed an agreement
providing for payment o f interest on Government cash balances held in the TSA with BI.

18. Cash flow forecasting has been rudimentary and the poor quality o f cash forecasts i s one o f the
factors resulting in year-end bunching o f expenditures. The accelerated draw down o f Government
cash balances in December perpetuates wasteful procurement practices and also impacts monetary
policy. The recently concluded joint WB-IMF assessment o f GOI's Asset and Liabilities Management
(ALM) indicated that the uncoordinated management o f the gross asset-liability portfolio o f the GO1
and BI could lead to substantial risk to the overall balance sheet. The risks need to be mitigated


                                                                                                    110
                             Annex 8: Public Financial Management
through optimization o f borrowing and better reserve management. Critical TSA implementation
milestones have been incorporated as performance indicators in the D P L series.

       3. Strengthening Monitoring and Evaluation o f Public Expenditures and Programs

19. T o ensure more effective public spending, improved capacity to analyze the efficiency and
effectiveness o f public spending i s essential. BAPPENAS has recently established a separate
department and designated a Deputy to monitor and evaluate public expenditures with designated
responsibilities for sector-based and regional evaluation as well as reporting o f development
performance. Several analytical pieces have been produced in the last few years, and efforts by
BAPPENAS and M o F to improve the quality o f public spending aimed at improving the delivery o f
public services should be bolstered. The formulation o f the RPJM for 2010-14, which i s coterminous
with the coming presidential term, i s now well underway.

20.   The monitoring and evaluation o f the implementation o f the new RPJM will require
BAPPENAS to continue and expand the expenditure analysis at the sector level (e.g., education,
health, agriculture, and infrastructure). A deeper understanding o f spending at the sector level should
also enhance general capacity to implement performance based budgetingin the pilot agencies.

                            4. Improving the Public Procurement System

21. The past few years have witnessed improvements in the public procurement environment.
Keppres No. 80/2003 provided a national public procurement regulation that meets most o f what i s
generally regarded as accepted international practice, including basic principles: transparency, open
competition, economy and efficiency. This decree also paved the way for establishing a regulatory
body for public procurement. With the introduction o f Keppres No. 80/2003, a previous certification
("pre-qualification") process for suppliers/ providers o f goods and services was, in most instances,
abandoned by the Government. Keppres No. 80/2003 also established the basis for sanctions,
complaint-handling and requirements for certification of users. Perpres No. 106/2007 was signed in
December 2007 establishing an independent agency, the Lembaga Kebijakan Pengadaan BarangJasa
Pemerintah (LKPP) or National Public Procurement Agency, that i s responsible for sustainable,
integrated, focused and coordinated planning and development o f strategies/policies/regulations
associated with the procurement o f goods/works/services using public funds. This institution reports
directly to the President o f the Republic. In addition to the Chairman, who heads LKPP, and an
Executive Secretary, there are four departments, each headed by a Deputy with responsibilities for (i)
Strategy and Policy Development, (ii)      Monitoring-Evaluation and Information Systems, (iii)
                                                                                              Human
Resources Development, and (iv) Legal Affairs and Settlement o f Objections respectively. The LKPP
i s currently operational with plans for further staffing.

22.    While Keppres No. 80/2003 was a welcome development for the country, the public
procurement system s t i l l has significant deficiencies in its regulatory and, more importantly,
implementation aspects. There has been slow progress in the development o f procurement regulations
anchored b y a law; slow progress in the development and use o f standard tools in terms o f bidding
documents and users manuals; collusion and corruption practices in the bidding process as well as
concerns over the efficiency o f the compliant mechanisms and sanction measures are s t i l l significant.
However, the most significant deficiency i s the absence o f professional procurement management and
weakness in procurement capacity in implementing agencies, especially at the provincial and district
levels.

23. This i s supported by the findings o f some analytical tools and reports such as the self-diagnostic
assessment conducted by the GO1 in 2007 using the Base-Line Indicators (BLIs) tool developed under


                                                                                                     111

The assessment of the BLIs presents a "snapshot" comparison of the actual system against the
international standards or the "model system" that the BLIs represent. Baseline bench marking of
Indonesia's procurement system in June 2007 showed it scoring 62.5 percent for the Legislative and
                                        )55
Regulatory Framework (PILLAR I , percent for Institutional Framework and Management
Capacity (PILLAR I )     ,
                      I 59.3 percent for Procurement Operations and Market Practices (PILLAR 1 1        1)
and 69 percent for Integrity and Transparency of the Public Procurement System (PILLAR IV) in
comparison with recognized international standards. While the establishment o f LKPP would increase
                              1
the overall score for Pillar 1 , the assessment indicates that there i s significant areas that would need
improvement.

24.   The LKPP i s currently moving on parallel tracks to reform the public procurement system as
follows:

25. Legislative and regulatory framework: the LKPP i s currently working on two tracks: The
preparation of a new procurement law and the revision of Keppres 80/2003. The preparation and
enactment of a new procurement law may be a lengthy process due to the requirements o f it being
passed through Parliament which will require significant stakeholder consultation process, consensus
building as well as overcoming possible opposition from interest groups. As an interim measure,
LKPP i s in the process of reviewing Keppres No. 80. The main reason for this revision i s to re-
organize it into different sections dealing with specific topics and referring to mandatory use o f a set
of national standard bidding documents. This process i s behind schedule due to the methodology of
work being carried through a committee, which generates lengthy discussions and needs for consensus
building. LKPP expects to have a draft of the revised Keppres no.80/2003 by August 2009, to be
submitted for inter-ministerial review. While the actual issuance of the presidential decree might be
delayed for political reasons it should be acknowledged that having a revised Keppres and i t s
potential endorsement by October this year, represents an important reform step that might even lead
to changes in the way the 2010 budget i s implemented.

26.    Currently, there are no national standard bidding documents that are used regularly by a l l
Government agencies in the country. Some implementing agencies (such as the Ministry of Public
Works) have developed standard bidding documents for their own use. NPPO (the predecessor of
LKPP), through the support of ADB, has drafted eight National Model (Standard) Bidding Documents
being (1) An Explanatory Guide, (2) Goods with Pre-qualification, (3) Goods with Post-qualification,
(4) Works with Pre-qualification, (5) Works with Post-qualification, (6) Other Services with Pre-
qualification, (7) Other Services with Post-qualification, and (8) Consulting Services, and that are
now available in a draft form. The use o f these documents i s s t i l l not mandatory and they are being
used on a pilot basis. I t i s important for LKPP to collect final comments from users on these
documents, improve them and mandate their use on a national basis. One of the improvements would
be to harmonize such documents with those of InternationalDevelopment Partners such as the World
Bank, ADB, JBIC and AusAID.

27. The approach o f LKPP towards preparing a procurement law and reviewing Keppres No.
80/2003 i s reasonable and will ensure phased progress within the GO1 agenda as well as the working
mechanisms between the different agencies (LKPP, ministries, parliament etc..). To maximize the
opportunity for reform when preparing a procurement law, it i s important to take into consideration
that a number of laws have been enacted since 2000 that impact, or make reference to, public
procurement. These include construction law, state finance, treasury, audit and small-scale business.
The pace o f Indonesia's decentralization reforms has impacted on public sector procurement at a l l
levels of Government, with ministers, governors, and even mayors able to issue decrees, regulations
and instructions. The plethora of regulations i s often inconsistent and many regulations do not meet


                                                                                                     112
                             Annex 8: Public Financial Management
accepted international practice. Consequently, national procurement reform and the need for national
procurement policies and standards are critical. Indonesia's legal framework for public sector
procurement can best be strengthened by anchoring it with an overarching consolidated and
comprehensive national public sector procurement law at the highest level that (i)    establishes the
fundamental principles and procedures applicable to all public sector procurement, (ii)
                                                                                      establish clear
responsibilities for a permanent procurement management function within implementing agencies,
(iii)
    amends other laws that refer to public sector procurement and ensures that such a law has the
necessary authority in a decentralized environment.

28.     In the meantime, the review o f Keppres No. 80 should attempt to address some o f these issues
within the possible scope o f a presidential decree introducing improvements to the current situation. It
i s also important for the current revisions to take into consideration simplifying Keppres so it can be
more "user friendly" with clear responsibilities for a permanent procurement management function.

29. Public procurement function and capacity building: There has been growing concern, both
by the Government and the international development partners over the pace of project
implementation. Significant delays and slow disbursement seem to occur across the entire P F M cycle.
Projects reported delays and difficulties in budget preparation and approval, budget execution, and
implementatiodprocurement. Specifically, there are concerns with the organization o f the
procurement management function as well as the capacity o f procurement committee members. While
Keppres 80 requires certification o f all procurement committee members, the current certification
process does not support the development o f procurement capacity and the current ad-hoc nature o f
managing procurement inhibits the build-up o f sustainable knowledge within implementingagencies.

30. LKPP i s currently conducting a competency level survey to determine the different levels of
competency required for carrying procurement tasks and existing gaps. It i s also in the process o f
recruiting a long term international expert to support the development o f a national strategy on
capacity building. In addition, LKPP i s developing different models for the introduction o f central
procurement units at ministries and local Governments.

31. In the meantime, there are several ongoing activities to improve procurement management in
implementing agencies. The Directorate General o f Highways (DGH) in M o P W i s in the process of
establishing a `procurement team to support overall procurement in the DGH. This i s a trigger for
I D P L with a possibility o f having a future trigger expanding this to the other two directorates in the
Ministry o f Public Works. On the other hand, M o F has established a significant precedent in the
country by creating a procurement function with an Echelon I1 level manager. At the local level, there
are some ongoing activities supported by the Bank funded local Governments' projects (ILGRIP and
USDRP).

32. In summary, there are several initiatives on this area but progress has been very slow. The
absence o f professional procurement management in implementing agencies, fragmentation o f
procurement responsibility and weak procurement capacity are the most important impediments to
improving public procurement in the country. LKPP should focus i t s resources on the development of
a human resources strategy that can tackle the challenges in this area. LKPP should support the
ongoing pilot activities in MoF, DGH and some local Governments to ensure success o f these pilots.
The human resource strategy should also respond to the need o f strengthening the capacity o f
Government auditing agencies to carry procurement audit. Another important aspect would be to
develop a set o f performance indicators to monitor the procurement performance across implementing
agencies and units within these agencies. These should be a limited number o f key indicators that
could be collected through e-procurement systems.


                                                                                                     113
                                    Annex 8: Public Financial Management
33, Corruption, sanctions and independent appeals mechanism: Despite improvements in the
public procurement system, concerns remain over corrupt and collusive practices. While addressing
this requires an overall governance strategy, there are several important elements in the procurement
system that can support such a strategy, for example an independent complaints mechanism, an
effective sanctions mechanism, and improving transparency in the procurement process through the
use of e-procurement.

34.   Keppres No. 80/2003 requires the establishment o f a complaints handling mechanism.
However, this i s not set up independently but within each implementing agency. LKPP i s now in the
process of finalizing its strategy to approach complaints handling. It i s currently weighing different
modalities for managing the complaint handling and the role of LKPP. While it i s imperative to
develop procedures for an independent complaints handling mechanism, LKPP should avoid
becoming the agency to which these complaints are addressed but rather develop a system and
monitor i t s efficiency and reliability.

35. The sanctions mechanism i s operated by each implementing agency according to Keppres 80
requirements. There i s no clarity on the effectiveness of this system which warrants an assessment to
be conducted by LKPP on the effectiveness of the current sanctions mechanisms and possible
improvements in the implementationprocess.
36. E-procurement: The Ministry of Public Works, Ministry o f Communications and Information
and the City of Surabaya have a l l been at the forefront in the development of e-Government
Procurement (e-GP) technology. The LKPP i s currently taking the lead on behalf of the Government
for implementation o f e-GP in Indonesia at a national and sub-national level. The critical issue now i s
to develop a roadmap for the development o f e-GP in the country, setting the roles o f the different
stakeholders, and the responsibility for ensuring minimum inter-operability and core data standards
for the various e-GP providers to comply with.

                         5. Improving Government Accounting and Audit Functions

                                  Accounting and Reporting on Budget Execution

37. Even though the aggregate Government Annual Financial Statements have been prepared in a
timely manner for the last five years, they continue to receive a "disclaimer" audit opinion on from
the external auditors. One o f the reasons cited for the "disclaimer" opinion i s internal control
weaknesses in the preparationo f financial statements. Thus the top priority for GO1 i s to improve the
quality of financial statements to get out o f the disclaimer status.

38.   There has been improvement in the number of line ministries receiving favorable opinions from
the external auditors. The number of line ministries with clean opinion has increased from 7 in 2006
to 16 in 2007 to 34 in 2008. The number o f ministries with disclaimers has come down from 33 in
2007 to 18 in 20081. Nonetheless, the overall financial statements continue to receive a "disclaimer
opinion". The Ministry of Finance i s straining to get out o f the disclaimer status in 2009.

39.    Capacity constraints in the line ministries are the biggest challenge. The number o f trained
accountants in line ministries and sub national Governments i s low and the quality of their work needs
improvement. DG Treasury has an ambitious training program in place which targets training of at
least one person for each of the country's 22,300 working units (SatKer) by 2010. 9,000 people have
been trained already and around 7,600 people each are expected to be trained in 2009 and 2010.
However, this i s only a short term solution and in the long term, there i s a need for a sustained and

'For 2008, out of 82 line ministries, 34 have received a clean opinion, 28 a qualified opinion and 18 a disclaimer. 2 of the line
ministries are yet to receive their final audit report.

                                                                                                                             114
                             Annex 8: Public Financial Management
continuous training o f staff from line ministries. There i s an Education and Training Unit within M o F
which i s considering a plan for working with regional universities to institute such a program.
However, the plans are at an early stage at this point.

40.   The annual financial statements are prepared on an accrual basis and there i s a plan to move to
full accrual accounting for line ministries and sub national Governments by 2014. The accounting
standards for accrual accounting have already been drafted and are currently undergoing a review
process.

41. Thus, even though there i s considerable improvement in the quality o f accounting and financial
reporting, and the future direction seems to be good, human resource issues continue to be a
significant constraint.


                                  Internal Controls and Internal Audit

42. The PEFA assessment o f 2007 classifies weaknesses in control execution a significant risk to
reforms introduced in other areas o f PFM. The internal audit function in the country i s classified as
fragmented and characterized by weak capacity.

43.   The key reform priorities in the area o f internal control and internal audit are: (a) r o l l out o f
SPAN; (b) implementation o f COSO control framework and (c) strengthening o f internal audit
function o f GOI.

44.   The r o l l out o f SPAN, targeted for 2011, i s expected to strengthen internal controls by
introducing a formal commitment control system in the line ministries, ensuring adherence o f the
budget ceilings and reducing the time lags in processing payments and budget revisions. The contract
for providing the SPAN turnkey solution has already been signed on July 10th. Limited capacity in
M o F and other line ministries and ownership o f the program are key challenges. The P F M team in
the Bank i s closely engaged in the process. A business process review i s underway and change
management consultants are expected to be on board in the next few months to help DG Treasury deal
with human resources issues through the transition.

45.    Through Government Regulation (PP) 60/2008, GO1 has adopted COSO as i t s internal control
framework. The regulation embraces the core principles o f COSO framework in a comprehensive
manner. However, the key challenge i s in the implementation o f the framework. The GO1 regulation
entrusts BPKP with the role o f designing the internal control implementation, provide guidance and
training to the line ministries on COSO implementation. In June 2009, BPKP and MoF, with
assistance from the Bank, organized COSO workshops for management and auditors to better
socialize the concepts and implementation experiences related to COSO. BPKP i s in the process o f
preparing an ambitious strategic plan for COSO implementation which may start through some pilots.
The limited capacity at BPKP in implementing major reforms and limited interest from the
management o f line ministries remain significant challenges. As a part o f its implementation strategy,
BPKP i s seeking support o f expert staff and continued socialization to meet these challenges.
However, implementation o f COSO i s currently only at planning stage and implementation on a pilot
basis may begin only in 2010.

46.   PP 60/2008 also gives BPKP the mandate for strengthening the internal audit function in the
country which i s currently fragmented and suffers from a serious lack o f capacity. The quality o f
audit by IGs in line ministries and Bawasdas in local Governments remains sub optimal with little
focus on risk based audit. A Bank funded peer review o f BPKP in 2008 concluded that even though

                                                                                                       115
                                Annex 8: Public Financial Management
  BPKP follows international standards o f auditing, there are some weaknesses in i t s practices. BPKP
  has drawn an action plan to specifically address those weaknesses. Lack o f trained and skilled
  auditors and scale o f the country with Bawasda auditors in over 500 locations makes the task o f
  reforming the internal audit function in the country really challenging. BPKP's proposal on
  strengthening o f the internal audit function in the country which i s under preparation and i s expected
                 S
  to cost over U D 40 M, i s aimed at instituting a framework for the internal audit function in the
  country and a systematic capacity building and continued education for internal auditors at all levels.
. However, the proposed i s in early stages o f preparation and may need strong support from the Bank
  and other development partners to be effective.

                                                  External Audit

 47.   B P K has the mandate to audit all Government entities including State Owned Enterprises
 (SOEs) and has grown considerably in terms o f budget allocation, number o f regional offices and the
 number o f auditors it employs2. The main priority at this point i s technical capacity building o f the
 B P K staff. ADB has been supporting B P K through i t s STAR project which will come to an end next
 year.

 48.   B P K performs financial, performance and special purposes audits. The audits are undertaken in
 accordance with B P K auditing standards which are generally in line with international auditing
 standards. B P K has an arrangement with NAO Australia on technical skill transfer in the area o f
 performance audit and has benefited from the trainings and staff exchange program with NAO.

 49.    B P K has been able to submit the audited financial statements within 5 months o f the end o f the
 fiscal year for the past five years. B P K also submits interim audit reports to the Parliament every six
 months.

 50. B P K i s currently undergoing a peer review process with the Dutch Supreme Audit agency. The
 process i s expected to identify critical areas for the development o f the institution and B P K expects to
 draw a comprehensive institutional development plan based on the peer review results that will be
 available later this year. B P K may need financial and technical assistance to implement such an
 institutional development plan at that time.



                          6. ReformingRegional Public Financial Management

 5 1. Sub-national P F M reforms have failed to produce their expected results. Decentralization has
 provided sub-national Governments with significant resources and responsibilities. More than one-
 third o f public spending i s now executed by sub-national Governments. This level o f expenditure
 requires an adequate regulatory framework, together with sufficient P F M capacity, at the sub-national
 level if it i s to be fully effective. In order to address this need, in 2005 the central Government passed
 comprehensive legislation on P F M reforms at the sub-national level, with the aim o f mirroring
 reforms already being implemented at the center. However, most regions lack the technical and
 human resources to implement the reforms. For example, sub-national Governments are obliged by
 law to report certain fiscal and financial information to the central Government within a clear
 timeframe. In reality, many sub-national Governments struggle to meet their deadlines for submission.


   The number of BPK staff has risen from 2854 in 2004 to 4382 in 2008. The annual budget for 2009 i s Rp 1.7
 trillion in 2009 compared to Rp 234 billion in 2004. The number o f regional offices has risen from 7 in 2004 to
 33 in 2009.

                                                                                                              116
                               Annex 8: Public Financial Management
52. Current budget allocation and disbursement practices contribute to fiscal discipline at the
central level but they constrain successful financial management at the local level. Allocations to
individual sub-national Government units are formally issued after the passage o f the central
Government budget in October prior to the fiscal year in question and commence through derivative
regulations (e.g., ministerial decrees). W h i l e this may appear to allow sufficient time for sub-national
Governments to finalize their budgets, in reality budget allocations o f shared non-tax revenue (oil and
gas) are frequently issued close to the beginning, or first few months, o f the fiscal year. The notional
allocations are frequently underestimated by the central Government and disbursements from the
center to the regions are back-loaded towards the end o f the fiscal year. This i s because the transfers
in the final quarter are based on actual revenues, which are usually higher than projected revenues.
53. Sub-national Governments are struggling to spend their increasing budgets and have built up
reserves in recent years for three main reasons. First, sub-national Governments often underestimate
their revenues due to lack o f revenue-management capacity, compounded by the under-budgetingo f
transfers by the central Government. Second, delays in the budget approval process and lack o f
implementation capacity result in under-spending o f budgeted programs by sub-national
Governments. Third, sub-national Governments may not have the capacity to spend the resources at
their disposal when these resources increase significantly and abruptly. This was the case with the 64
percent increase in DAU from 2005 to 2006, which led to a significant increase in sub-national
Government reserves.

54.   Some challenges in addressing the constraints in P F M at the sub-national level include: (i)
providing timely estimates from the sectoral ministries o f revenue-sharing transfers; (ii)
                                                                                          building the
capacity o f sub-national Governments to manage accumulated reserves; and (iii)         improving and
streamlining the budget approval process. The need to streamline the budget approval process in
particular affects Law No. 33/2004, which stipulates that provincial and district budgets must be
approved by the Ministry o f Home Affairs and the provincial Government, respectively. This process
may be one factor contributing towards lengthening the budget approval process.

55. In order to address the financial management issues and challenges at the sub-national level, the
central Government has implemented several reforms.


      1. `Burden-sharing policy'
           Introduced in 2009, this policy incorporates major subsidies, including fuel subsidies, into the
           DAU pool allocation. The policy will increase the accuracy o f transfer projections during the
           full fiscal year, given that there i s a disincentive for the central Government to under-estimate
          the o i l price assumption, especially in relation to regional transfers. A more rational o i l price
           assumption will lead to better estimates o f revenue-sharing which, in turn, will help sub-
          national Governments to better plan their budgets.

          Two actions are needed to optimize this policy. First, the central Government should establish
          a system to regularly monitor quarterly revenue-sharing transfers, as stipulated in L a w No.
          33/2004. Second, the central Government, through the relevant agencies, needs to improve
          production estimates for revenue-sharing, especially if back-loaded transfers at the end o f the
          fiscal year persist.

      2. Late budget approval sanctions
          Starting from 2008, the Government has applied sanctions to improve the budget approval
          process. Based on Government Regulation (PP) No. 56/2005 and M o F Decree No. 46/2006
          regarding the Regional Financial Information System, provincial and district Governments
          have to submit their annual budgets to the M o F before January 3 1 o f the corresponding fiscal


                                                                                                          117
                             Annex 8: Public Financial Management
        year. Sub-national Governments that miss the deadline by at least one month will receive a
        warning letter to submit their budget before March 3 1. If a sub-national Government has not
        submitted i t s budget by that date, the MoF, in coordination with the MoHA, can sanction the
        sub-national Government by postponing the transfer o f i t s DAU (25 percent o f monthly
        transfers) until the budget i s submitted.

        This sanction initiative has resulted in more timely budget submissions. Between 2006 and
        2007, 54 percent o f sub-national Governments approved their budgets after March. In 2008,
        the year the sanction was introduced, 87 percent o f sub-national Government submitted their
        budgets to the M o F before March. If the Government wishes to ensure the effectiveness o f
        this reform, the M o F should continue to monitor sub-national Government budget
        submissions.

56.   The M o F can also assist sub-national Governments in managing reserves and surpluses by
strengthening the regulatory framework for sub-national financial management. In doing so, the M o F
should develop guidelines for regions on the accumulation and use o f reserves. These guidelines
should help sub-national Governments use their reserves more effectively, for example, by (i)      settling
outstanding, arrears, given that about 85 percent o f sub-national Governments in arrears could clear
these arrears by drawing on reserves; and (ii)      where sub-national Governments have constant or
increasingly high levels o f reserves, using them to increase investment in public infrastructure.

                                 7. Governance and Anti Corruption

57. Public confidence towards the Government's efforts in combating corruption has been slowly
restored over the past few years, as reflected in a number o f opinion polls and corruption perception
surveys, but concerns are mounting as to whether the fight against corruption will continue as
vigorously or as effectively in the next five years, given what appear to be strengthening efforts to
reduce the effectiveness o f the well-regarded Corruption Eradication Commission (KPK).

58. The Corruption Eradication Commission (KPK) continues to take the lead in investigating and
prosecuting high profile corruption cases. At an unprecedented level, politicians and high ranking
Government officials are under investigation or have been convicted o f corruption, including
members o f the parliament, the former national police chief, former governors and officials o f the
central bank and heads o f local Government. Even after the recent arrest for a murder charge o f the
chair o f the Commission, KPK has been proving i t s effectiveness as an independent law enforcement
agency. The Attorney General's Office has also created an Anti Corruption Task Force to improve
effectiveness o f corruption investigation and prosecution.

59. Recently, however, there have been attempts to weaken the KPK. Since in 2006, the
Constitutional Court declared that the Anti Corruption Court - a special court currently trying cases
investigated and prosecuted by KPK - was unconstitutional and extended i t s l i f e to 3 years, the law
governing both the K P K and the Court has to be revised soon. The administration i s taking this
opportunity to propose the Corrupt Crimes Court Bill which, if passed, will shrink the proportion o f
ad hoc judges from a majority to a minority o f judicial panels thereby rendering the Corrupt Crimes
Court very similar to the regular courts that have largely failed to punish corruption. The bill would
also end KPK's power to prosecute cases itself requiring instead that the problematic Attorney
General's Office conduct all prosecutions.

60. Apart from stronger enforcement against corrupt practices, civil service and judicial reform
remains at the heart o f the Government's strategy in the fight against corruption. The Government
plans to expand the ongoing c i v i l service reform to other agencies under the leadership o f MenPAN.

                            Annex 8: Public Financial Management
While the Ministry still lacks the necessary capability to monitor, evaluate and drive bureaucracy
reform, Government agencies are undertaking significant reforms. The Supreme Court, in particular,
has undergone significant restructuringand as a result, the quality of i t s decisions has improved. The
majority of Supreme Court decisions has been in favor of, or has reinforced a strong stance against
corruption.

6 1. While civil service reform i s taking a steady pace, the future of KPK and the mainstream efforts
to investigate and prosecute corruption will depend on the outcome of the revision of the law on Anti
Corruption, the law governing KPK, and the law on the Anti Corruption Court. In addition, it also will
depend on the budget allocated for KPK (in the previous budget year the Parliament cut down the
budget proposed by the KPK).

                                1 1 Key Areas for Future Attention

62. In the period ahead, progress on the following key ongoing PFM reforms will need to be closely
monitored:

       Ensuring coherence and momentum in PFM reform.
       Deepening the reforms of the central Government budgetary systems to ensure policy
       orientation in budget formulation and execution.
       Ensuring greater integrity and more effective management o f public funds through continued
       implementation o f a TSA, automating the treasury payments system and the institution o f
       measures to prevent the proliferation o f off-budget bank accounts.
       Implementation of a new treasury system, extending implementation of Government
       Accounting Standards and re-engineering of underlying business processes at spending
       agencies to ensure relevant and reliable financial reporting.
       Extending modem financial accountability and management processes to sub-national
       Governments in a coordinated manner and bringing these fully in line with emerging national
       standards.
       Improving the M & E capacity of BAPPENAS by expanding the expenditure analysis at the
       sector level and developing a deeper understanding of spending at the sector level.
       Developing a roadmap for the development of e-Government procurement in the country,
       setting the roles of the different stakeholders, and the responsibility for ensuring minimum
       inter-operabilityand core data standards for the various e-GP providers to comply with.
       Developing a human resources strategy that could tackle the challenges in procurement
       reform such as the development o f a permanent procurement management function in
       implementing agencies, develop a sustainable capacity building approach and support the
       development of training institutions in universities and private sector.
       Continuing to develop human resources in the area of Government accounting and reporting.
       Preparing a strategic plan for COS0 implementationwhich may start through some pilots.
       Strengthening the internal audit function in the country by modernizing the internal audit
       institutions in the country, providing intensive training to the internal audit staff and by
       establishingsynergistic relationshipsbetween the BPKP, Inspector Generals, and Bawasdas.
       Continued strengthening of the Supreme Audit Agency (SAI) of the country (BPK) through
       technical assistance.
       Improving the management o f reserves and surplus by strengthening the regulatory
       framework for SNG financial management.
       Continuing to monitor SNG budget submission and the implementation of sanctions for late
       performers.


                                                                                                   119
                             Annex 8: Public Financial Management
          Streamlining Law No. 33/2004, which requires the Ministry o f Home Affairs to approve
          provincial and district budgets, so as to expedite the process o f budget approval.
      0   Promulgating a law on the special powers o f KPK, the powers o f the Anti Corruption Court,
          and the role o f non-career or ad hoc judges.

63. Many o f these reforms are being actively considered and prioritized and implementation plans
are being developed by the Government. Implementation i s well underway in regard to the TSA and
the institutional framework for procurement.

64.   The capacity to centrally monitor these and other reforms has recently been established at the
Secretary-General's office o f the MoF. Indonesia would benefit from a coherent reform plan or
strategy to ensure proper phasing and coordination o f PFM reforms. This would also allow for
enhanced monitoring and accountability within the Go1 and thus provide additional momentum and
direction to reform efforts.

                                  Management o f Foreign Exchange
65. The foreign exchange control environment i s assessed to be generally satisfactory. The country
i s no longer subject to the Extended Arrangement from the IMF. Bank Indonesia (BI) was last subject
to the transitional procedures under the Fund's safeguards assessment policy in 2002. That
assessment recommended remedial action to address a number o f vulnerabilities in the audit
arrangements o f BI. The main recommendations have been implemented, including the establishment
o f an independent audit committee at B I and the publication o f BI's audited financial statements.
Audited financial statements for BI for 2008 have been reviewed and the audit report issued by the
BPK contained an unqualified opinion.


                                          N.    Conclusion

66.   Indonesia has established a sound legal and administrative framework for modem PFM.
Changes in the legal and regulatory architecture are now largely complete and the momentum has
shifted towards implementation o f new PFM practices.

67. Known weaknesses in financial management and accountability continue to be gradually
addressed through the PFM reform program discussed above. The development partners are actively
engaged in this process. Key elements o f the reforms are supported by the DPL triggers, as well as
the GFMRAP project and initiatives supported by development partners. However, much remains to
be done, and it will take time to realize the full impact o f these reforms.

68. Although the pace o f implementing the planned reforms has been somewhat slow over the past
year, the trajectory o f reform i s in the right direction and the current Government continues to
demonstrate a commitment to continue the task o f completing the planned reforms in PFM. Taking
these into consideration, the Bank assessment team does not propose putting in place any additional
fiduciary arrangements for this operation.
