1. Project Context, Development Objectives and Design

1.1 Context at Appraisal

Albania transitioned away from an extremely closed, autarchic socialist system only in 1992.
At that time, Albania's administrative system was considered chaotic and ineffective. Its
administrative culture - a combination of many influences - emphasized security over service
delivery. The capacity of public administration was weak; the system, stemming from a party
focused environment, was highly politicized. Corruption was pervasive in every facet of the
public sector. Citizens feared public administration and did not trust it to provide even the
most basic services in a fair or impartial way.

The financial collapse in 1997 was a watershed event in Albania's transition from its
communist past. It highlighted the problems of Albania's economic governance capacity and,
from an administrative standpoint, reaffirmed and highlighted the inefficacy of a public
administration, unable to enforce its laws and regulations. As the public's confidence in
Albanian institutions had been significantly eroded by the recent events, restoring the public's
trust in the government became the main priority of the government. In order to achieve this
objective the capacity of the public administration needed to be dramatically strengthened.
The donors concurred with this assessment.

IDA, starting with the 1998 CAS, considered governance and institution building as one of
the central planks of its intervention and identified the need to adopt and implement reforms
to build an accountable and transparent state as the most important challenge facing the
Government of Albania. Over the next several years, the Albanian Government, in
partnership with donors, emphasized institutional reform and capacity building and developed
a comprehensive strategy to strengthen the public institutions for more effective governance.

On matters of public administration, the Government's strategy focused on addressing two
inter-related sets of interventions: (a) strengthening public financial management, including
the management of both public expenditures and revenues; and (b) strengthening human
resource management.       The Government worked with donors on the public financial
management agenda by strengthening core public financial management units (Ministry of
Finance, Supreme Audit Institute, Procurement Directorate within the Office of the Prime
Minister) as well as the financial management units within each line agency (e.g., budget
departments within line Ministries). On matters relating to public sector human resource
management, the reform strategy envisaged addressing this issue in two major stages: civil
service reform and broader public sector human resource management reform. During the
first stage, the reforms aimed to create the managerial and professional nucleus required to
lead any serious efforts to improve the accountability and performance of public institutions.
Subsequently, in a second stage, the reform would address the larger body of public
employees to improve productivity and accountability for their work and ensure that public
policies, programs and services are delivered reliably and cost-effectively.

During the first years of the reform, the government focused on improving the legislative
framework to ensure that its objectives could be achieved. By 1999, and prior to the approval
of the credit under review by this ICR, the Government had identified and adopted a large
number of measures which provided important institutional capacity to strengthen the public
administration.     Supported by the Structural Adjustment Credit (SAC), and Public
Expenditure Support Credit, the government undertook a number of pivotal actions which
defined the framework of reform. Among them, Parliament revised the Civil Service Law in
November 1999, and an independent Civil Service Commission (CSC) was created and
staffed. The Department of Public Administration (DoPA) was strengthened and placed in the



                                                1

Prime Minister's Office to help it manage across government departments. The recruitment of
50 civil servants under transparent, competitive, merit-based procedures as established under
the human resources management legislation was completed.

In addition, the Government issued a decree revising the public sector salary structure and
completed functional reviews of the Council of Ministers (CoM), Ministry of Finance (MoF),
Ministry of Justice, and Ministry of Local Government and begun implementing the
recommendations so as to enhance policy formulation and coordination.

The Public Administration Reform Project (PARP), under review in this ICR, was an
investment credit aimed at supporting the implementation of this ambitious reform agenda.
The credit targeted governance and institution building to support both the public expenditure
management and the human resource management agendas. It was complemented by a long
series of policy based adjustment operations and extensive economic and sector-related work
as well as related activities financed by other donors.

1.2 Original Project Development Objectives (PDO) and Key Indicators (as approved)

The Project Development Objective indicated in the Project Appraisal Document (PAD)
(Report No. 20059-ALB) is:

The Government of Albania has adopted a comprehensive policy reform program to
strengthen Albania's weak institutional and governance capacity. This policy reform program
is being supported by a Structural Adjustment Credit, which was approved by the Bank in
June of 1999. The overall objective of the proposed Public Administration Reform Project is
to provide required resources for technical assistance, training, goods and incremental
operating costs that are needed to implement the Government's Institutional and Public
Administration Reform agenda effectively.

The Development Credit Agreement (DCA) states the objective of the project to be:

The objective of the Project is to assist the Borrower to improve its capacity with regard to
policy formulation and coordination, and administrative performance so as to create
conditions that will encourage the Department of Public Administration of the Borrower to
improve their service delivery.

The core set of measures of impacts on institutional performance to monitor intermediate
institutional impacts is indicated in the PAD. It includes an extensive list of indicators, some
of which were intended to help the Government focus attention on the longer-term objectives
of its reform effort, and to capture the more immediate and concrete progress. They include:

Policy and Public Expenditure Management: (i) aggregate fiscal discipline including
inflation rate, revenue predictability, and fiscal aggregates; (ii) strategic prioritization
including policy volatility, delays in auditing, and deviation from functional appropriations
and (iii) operational efficiency including representative deviation by spending units at sector
level, and transparent, competitive procurement

Public Sector Human Resource Management: (i) fiscally sound pay and employment
practices including the number of civil and public servants in comparison with international
practices, and fiscal weight of public employment in comparison with international practice;
(ii) competitive and non-arbitrary remuneration including civil service pay (vertical and
horizontal compression), and comparisons with the private sector; and iii) human resource
management based on rules, performance and fairness including rule credibility, and limited
incidence of political appointees in the civil service

1.3 Revised PDO (as approved by original approving authority) and Key Indicators, and
reasons/justification

There were no formal revisions of the PDO during the life of the project. However, to give
them greater specificity for ease of operational monitoring, a rephrased PDO was used by the
task team in project progress monitoring from June 2002. These indicators were also backed
by the detailed impact monitoring effort built into the project. When Quality Assurance Group
(QAG) assessed the quality of supervision in 2004, this revision in the PDO was reported.
The rephrased PDO is:

Improve key dimensions of public sector institutional arrangements and practices in Albania,
including:
     Budget formulation practices that more effectively support rational budget allocation
        decisions
     Budget execution practices that better support effective management by budget
        institutions
     Continued affordable human resource management



                                                        3

      Employment conditions within the civil service that make it easer to attract, retain and
         motivate qualified civil servants
      More meritocratic and depoliticized management of the civil service
      Policy formulation deliberations that are more contestable.

In the latter part of project implementation, the following PDO indicators were used in the
Implementation Status Report (ISR).
      Integrated Planning System approved by CoM and launched
      Treasury modernization system fully operational in MoF, all District Treasury Offices
         and pilot-tested in line ministries and local governments
      Civil Service Law (CSL) effective and enforced

The set of indicators specified in the PAD was continuously monitored by the Government
and the Bank throughout project implementation.

1.4 Main Beneficiaries,
(original and revised, briefly describe the "primary target group" identified in the PAD and
as captured in the PDO, as well as any other individuals and organizations expected to
benefit from the project)

The direct beneficiaries of the Project as identified in the PAD include: (i) the government;
(ii) the citizenry; (iii) line ministries involved in relevant policy coordination; (iv) ministers
and other political appointees; (v) civil servants; (vi) MoF; and (vii) public administration in
general. In addition, the Department of Public Administration (DoPA) is the direct beneficiary
of the Project as specifically mentioned in the Development Credit Agreement.

1.5 Original Components (as approved)

The project includes components addressing three crucial elements of the Government reform
strategy: (i) public expenditure management strengthening, (ii) human resource management
strengthening; and (iii) policy formulation and coordination strengthening. The project also
included a fourth component to handle (iv) management of the project itself.

1. Public Expenditure Management (US$5.74 Million)

This component addressed five elements of the public expenditure management system: (a)
budget formulation; (b) budget execution (including treasury); (c) macroeconomic and fiscal
forecasting and analysis; (d) accounting; and (e) procurement. In addition, it aimed to
strengthen the management of the Ministry of Finance (MoF) itself. Strengthening of public
expenditure management was to be supported by a range of activities including technical
assistance, training and computer hardware and software complementary to the TA and
training.    The Project envisaged building capacity in targeted pilot sector ministries in
formulating strategic and realistic budget plans that are able to link policy programs and
priorities with available resources. Key activities under subcomponents are listed below.

Subcomponent 1: Strengthening the strategic focus of the budget formulation (US $ 0.77
million) which includes support for the preparation and the implementation of a medium term
expenditure framework (MTEF); implementation of organizational changes and streamlining
the core functions of the Budget Department (BD); improvement in the legal and regulatory
framework for the budget process and classification (in cooperation with the IMF); and
training in budget formulation techniques.

Subcomponent 2: Strengthen treasury functions (US$ 2.57 million) which includes support for
development of a system for improving the revenue accounting in the Treasury; a long-term



                                                 4

periodic advisor to assist in improving cash management functions of the treasury department
and to assist in the implementation of a Treasury Ledger System.

Subcomponent 3: Strengthening macroeconomic and fiscal analysis (US$0.87 million)
including support for the implementation of agreed organizational changes; a long-term
periodic advisor for the review of the functions of the two macro departments, the economic
and fiscal forecast/analysis capacity, and fiscal statistics reporting; and relevant training.

Subcomponent 4: Strengthen accounting functions (US$0.46 million) including a long-term
periodic advisor to assist the Accounting Department and relevant training.

Subcomponent 5: Strengthen general management capacities (US$ 0.75 million) including a
long-term periodic advisor to assist the MoF; training on public expenditure management and
study tour on governance for key MoF staff; and establish the information technology (IT)
department in the MoF.

Subcomponent 6: Strengthen procurement policies and practices (US$0.32 million) including
a periodic-long term advisor to provide advice to Public Procurement Agency (PPA) on
improving procurement practices; assist PPA staff to prepare and disseminate procurement
enabling regulations, guidelines and manuals; and training.

2. Human resource management (US $ 2.32 Million)

This component included three sub-components: (a) implementation of the recently enacted
Civil Service Act; (b) strengthening of the Department of Public Administration, which is
lodged within the Office of the Prime Minister; and (c) supporting the establishment of the
Albanian Institute of Public Administration. Strengthening of public sector human resource
management was to be supported with technical assistance, training and computer hardware
and software complementary to the TA and training. Key activities under subcomponents are
listed below.

Subcomponent 1: Implement the Civil Service Act (CSA) (US$0.58 million) including a
periodic long-term advisor to provide ongoing advice on CSA implementation in such areas
as framework and procedures; marketing of CSA and its implementation strategy; support to
public agencies as they implement CSA; and monitoring and evaluation of CSA
implementation

Subcomponent 2: Strengthen the Department of Public Administration (US$1.50 million)
including periodic long-term advisor to provide ongoing advice to DoPA management on
such issues as pay and employment control; human resource management; and DoPA
organization and management; strengthen DoPA capacities to control public sector pay and
employment; assistance to ministries in establishing pay and employment control and
monitoring capacities; strengthen DoPA capacities to support modern human resource
management practices within Albania's public sector; and strengthen structure and
management of DoPA

Sub component 3:        Assist in Establishment of the Institute for Training in Public
Administration (ITPA) (US$0.24 million) including periodic long-term advisor on
establishment of Public Administration Training Institute; design, build and assist in
implementation of simple system for tracking training received; and assistance to ITPA and
DoPA staff in undertaking pilot evaluations of ITPA training targeting and impacts




                                                5

3. Policy formulation and coordination component (US$ 0.40 Million)

This component aimed to strengthen the professional (civil service) capacities to provide the
Council of Ministers (CoM) with policy analysis and support the policy coordination
function.   Strengthening of policy formulation and coordination was envisaged to be
supported with technical assistance, training and computer hardware and software
complementary to the TA and training. The TA was meant to support the Government's
efforts to build stable professional capacity within the Council of Ministers (CoM) to provide
systematic analyses of policy issues and tradeoffs raised by legislative and policy proposals.

Key activities under this component are: a periodic long-term advisor to provide advise to
PM, CoM and Secretary General on the means of strengthening the strategic focus and
effectiveness of CoM's policy formulation and coordination efforts; and associated training.

4. Project Management (US$ 0.51 million)

This component aimed to (a) ensure project management and implementation including
supporting all the required project administration capacities (e.g., accounting, audit,
procurement, disbursement management, monitoring and evaluation), and (b) supporting
several specific initiatives for monitoring and publicizing the intermediate impacts of the
Government's institutional and public administrative reform program. The project
management component envisaged to support both normal project management requirements
as well as technical assistance required to galvanize support within Albania for establishing
the capacity to systematically monitor and publicize the impacts of policies and programs.
Activities to be supported included:

Sub-component 1: Demonstrating the importance and means of systematically monitoring
and publicizing the impacts of policies and programs (US$0.35 million) including surveys;
publicity campaign; and produce and publicize assessment of the publicity and citizen
feedback campaign.

Subcomponent 2: Management of the Public Administration Reform Project (US$0. 16
million).

1.6 Revised Components

By the time of mid-term review in May-June 2003, it became apparent that the
implementation of the Treasury System requires more resources than originally allocated. In
light of the importance of this system in ensuring strengthened budget execution, the
Government and the IDA agreed in August 2004 to reconfigure the resource allocations
between components. A major part of financing was covered by: (i) use of unallocated funds;
(ii) reduction in the original scope of some contracts; and (iii) financing by DFID for
technical assistance needs in budget formulation subcomponent. It eventually resulted in a
reallocation of 25 percent of the project budget involving a total of $ 2,181,168 of allocations
to various sub-components.

The components for which allocations were dropped or reduced included: TA for budget
formulation (covered by DFID), strengthening of the Treasury and accounting function,
strengthening of management capacity, support to ITPA and the survey of public expenditure
management, HR management and anti-corruption issues. The unused balance of the macro-
economic and fiscal analysis sub-component was also reallocated. The re-allocated funds
were mostly allocated in favor of the Treasury System component which increased from $ 2.6
million to $ 5.0 million. A fair amount of reallocation occurred within components. The
eventual differences in allocation for individual components were between +16.8 percent
(Component 1) and -25.9 percent (Component 2) [Annex 1].


                                               6

In terms of expenditure category, the technical assistance category was reduced by 19 percent,
goods category was increased by 95 percent, and incremental operating costs were increased
by 50 percent. Unallocated resources were reduced from $650,000 to $479,000 (mainly to
keep a safeguard against SDR / USD fluctuations over the course of this project).

The development of a Human Resource Management System (HRMS) was added as a new
activity under the Human Resource Management component in this reconfiguration. The first
effort to establish an HRMS was with funding from the EU. In late 2003 it became clear that
this attempt was not successful, due to contractual issues and because this HRMS was
designed to be a stand-alone data base. The majority of the resources allocated to this activity
were aimed at providing technical assistance, and some small equipment purchases.

1.7 Other significant changes
(in design, scope and scale, implementation arrangements and schedule, and funding
allocations)

In 2005, the center left coalition which had governed Albania since 1997 was replaced by a
center right coalition. The new government sharply reduced the Council of Ministers staffing.
While the policy analysis and coordination function was maintained within the Council of
Ministers, responsibilities for management of the Public Administration were delegated to the
Ministry of Interior and DoPA became an independent agency under the supervision of the
Minister. This delegation of responsibilities had an impact on the project, in terms of timing,
implementation and outlook for some of the reforms.

There were three extensions of this project. The first occurred on August 20, 2004 and was for
a period of 18 months. The second occurred on June 15, 2006 and was for a period of four
months, while the third one was on October 31, 2006 for a period of 45 days. Overall the
project was extended by almost 24 months to December 15, 2006.

2. Key Factors Affecting Implementation and Outcomes

2.1 Project Preparation, Design and Quality at Entry
(including whether lessons of earlier operations were taken into account, risks and their
mitigations identified, and adequacy of participatory processes, as applicable)

The quality at entry was moderately satisfactory. This judgment balances the alignment with
the Government's Public Administration Reform Program, the strong donor coordination at
entry, the good work undertaken to prepare the Civil Service part of the project, and the
excellent coordination of the program with adjustment lending and ESW work on the positive
side against the complex design and the lack of adequate prior preparation for the
implementation of the Treasury System.

Strengths of the program at entry

Leading up to the project, there was extensive economic and sector work, including a Country
Economic Memorandum (CEM), Country Financial Accountability Assessment (CFAA) and
a Country Procurement Assessment Report (CPAR), social assessments, a governance and
anti-corruption report, and a Public Expenditure Review (PER). Significant analytical work
continued throughout the program, and helped to place Albanian reforms in the context of
international development experience, which the client appreciated. In addition, an effective
country dialogue helped shape and inform the development of the program.                Strong
coordination between the Country and Sector Units greatly enhanced the quality of the work
leading up to the approval of the credit.



                                               7

The project was complemented by several other investment operations, including health,
education, social services, land development, agriculture services, legal and judicial services,
as well as various adjustment operations such as the Stuctural Adjustment Credit (SAC), the
Poverty Reduction Support Credit (PRSC) series and the Development Policy Loan I (DPL I).
These investment operations provided the technical assistance that was relevant to the
development and implementation of the broader policy changes and allowed the Public
Administration Reform project to focus on its core mission.

The adjustment operations helped push ahead significant cross-cutting reforms in
governance--for example, the Medium Term Expenditure Framework process (MTBP in
Albania) was well supported by the PRSC, which in turn contributed to improving the
prioritization of resource allocation in the social sectors. Additionally the SAC/PRSCs
supported the establishment of a legal framework which created an important first step to
carrying out the reforms under implementation in the PARP. The key example is the Civil
Service Law. Subsequent adjustment operations built on the existing civil service reform
framework and designed core prior actions aimed at enforcement of the existing law. This
emphasis on enforcement proved effective.

Weaknesses of the program at entry

The objective of putting two sets of reforms under the umbrella of a single project was to
improve the odds of collaboration between the two central agencies leading each of these
reforms; i.e., MoF and DoPA. Yet experience with these sets of arrangements seems to
indicate that engendering the needed collaboration in practice is quite difficult and rarely
materializes solely on the basis of project coordination. Instead, including public expenditure
reforms and public administration reform in the same investment instrument only added
complexity to project implementation. It also increased the need for disparate skills within the
supervision team. In this context it is important to note that the Bank tends to make standard
allocations for supervision notwithstanding the project's complexity.

The implementation of the Treasury System and Human Resource Management Systems
should have been better prepared. More focus should have been placed on ensuring that the
appropriate human resource capacity was in place (hiring IT staff ahead of the
implementation), as well as ensuring that the coordinating body within the Ministry of
Finance were established.     These actions would have ensured that processes would be
reviewed and streamlined ahead of the project IT system implementation.

However, these measures would have significantly delayed Board presentation of the project
and there were merits perceived to have the investment project approved at the same time as
the SAC as leverage from the SAC helped spur the Government to move on key preparation
elements.    Given this strategic choice to go ahead with Board presentation despite the
inadequate preparation of the Treasury System component, the project's implementation
timeframe should have been extended to take into account the system's incomplete design.

Additionally, deficiencies in initial system design proposed by the consultants and poor
performance of the IT suppliers contributed considerably to a budget overrun and a slippage
during the implementation of both the Treasury System and the Human Resource
Management System.

Finally, given the polarized nature of the Albanian political system, dialogue on the Civil
Service Law could have benefited from a more comprehensive participation of the opposition
in consultations. Efforts were made to include experts close to the then opposition into
different focus groups and preparatory committees, and the various smaller opposition parties
who were represented in Parliament were also consulted. Yet, it appears that the Democratic


                                               8

Party, the largest opposition party- which was boycotting the Parliament- was not sufficiently
included in the process. The law accordingly was seen as a "majority law" and became the
focus of very strong attacks once the opposition came to power.

2.2 Implementation
(including any project changes/restructuring, mid-term review, Project at Risk status, and
actions taken, as applicable)

Some of the design shortcomings became quickly apparent, and the project team attempted to
address them during implementation. At mid-term review, as a result of the availability of
substantial grant financing for similar activities from other donors, and to accommodate the
increased estimated cost for the Treasury System, there was a considerable reallocation of
resources among components. Additionally, the HRMS, originally part of an EU-financed
project, was also added to the project. A number of activities considered essential within the
scope and objectives of each component were added.

The quality of supervision was assessed by QAG in September 2004 and the overall rating
was Highly Satisfactory. Project supervision missions, which provided guidance to the PIU
and implementing agencies, facilitated communication and resolution of inter-agency
obstacles, were carried out approximately twice per year. A Mid-Term review was held in
May-June 2003. The project required three extensions for a total period of about two years.
Disbursements were slower than initially projected in the PAD, due partly to optimistic
procurement schedules and reconfigured activities associated with the Treasury System, based
on a detailed assessment of its cost. During implementation, the project team was able to
identify problems encountered by the PIU and implementing agencies as they arose, and to
provide effective assistance in resolving them. For example, the team held weekly monitoring
conference on the Treasury System component to overcome implementation challenges in a
timely manner. The team used the resources to maintain appropriate balance between HQ and
field staff. It was very effective in exploiting synergies with other relevant projects and
activities in Albania including SAC, PRSC series, and the 2006 Public Expenditure and
Institutional Review (PEIR).

The project implementation was rated unsatisfactory between January-December, 2002 due to
slow disbursement. It was again rated unsatisfactory for a period of six months between June
2006 and the project closing in December 2006 due to implementation difficulties with the
Treasury System. This rating was also aimed to pressure the government to address slower
than expected disbursements.

2.3 Monitoring and Evaluation (M&E) Design, Implementation and Utilization

Monitoring and Evaluation of outcomes was an important component of project design,
played a very significant role throughout the life of the project and appears satisfactory. The
PIU continued monitoring the set of indicators agreed with the Bank. Key indicators specified
in the PAD were continuously monitored throughout project implementation. Additional
indicators were added and some adjustments were made. A series of indicators on outcomes
of all components were also utilized in the policy dialogue of associated adjustment
operations.

The indicators used appear adequate, and the client has internalized them in the daily work of
the agencies that are using them. These indicators have been successfully used by both the
Government and the Bank throughout the life of the project and have appropriately informed
the dialogue between the Bank and the Government during the period under review. The use
of monitoring indicators to assist in policy dialogue and implementation of the project greatly
enhanced the quality of the project implementation.



                                                9

2.4 Safeguard and Fiduciary Compliance
(focusing on issues and their resolution, as applicable)

Satisfactory financial management capacity and systems were developed early on and
maintained throughout the life of the project. Audits were compiled on time and did not
highlight any major irregularity.

As for procurement, the implementation unit did an excellent job in preparing the terms of
reference and the bidding contracts and procurement of the contracts generally occurred
without problems. Monitoring of project procurement and contract execution was careful,
timely and detailed. There were only two areas in which there were issues associated to
contract execution, one relating to the provision of hardware and software necessary for the
implementation of the Treasury System, and the other to provide technical assistance in order
to devise improved management systems for Subordinated Agencies.

With regards to the Treasury System, very substantial differences between the supplier and
the client led to significant delays which affected the implementation of the component.
Resolution of these issues required the involvement of the Bank team as well as management.

With regards to the contract relating to the management of subordinated agencies, after
several attempts to receive an improved product from the supplier, the executing agency
refused to accept the draft final report from the consultant and terminated the contract,
withholding the final payment (approximately 30 percent of total contract award).

2.5 Post-completion Operation/Next Phase
(including transition arrangement to post-completion operation of investments financed by
present operation, Operation & Maintenance arrangements, sustaining reforms and
institutional capacity, and next phase/follow-up operation, if applicable)

The project informed and enabled introduction of important policy measures and contributed
to achievements of parallel adjustment operations such as the Structural Adjustment Credit
(SAC) and the Poverty Reduction Support Credits (PRSC). The implementation of the
reforms supported by the Public Administration Reform Project continues to be the focus of
consistent monitoring and support in connection with the Development Policy Loans (DPL),
the first of which went to the Board in March, 2007.

While the current CAS does not provide explicitly for a follow-on operation, there may be a
need for additional technical assistance support from the Bank and other donors to sustain the
reform achievements to date, especially in the area of human resource management, budget
execution (Treasury System), and policy management.

The Government has secured additional support from the donor community to enhance and
implement the Integrated Planning System (IPS) devised through credit support.           The
European Union, in the context of its Stabilization and Association Agreement with Albania,
has a large and extended program to ensure achievement of a broad range of public
administration reform measures over the short and medium-term. A broad range of donors
remain committed and involved in ensuring improved outcomes in different areas of concern
to this credit.

3. Assessment of Outcomes

3.1 Relevance of Objectives, Design and Implementation
(to current country and global priorities, and Bank assistance strategy)

The project objectives are consistent with the Country Assistance Strategy as highlighted in
the past three CAS documents dating back to 1998. The Bank's current Country Assistance
Strategy for Albania, approved on January 10, 2006, identifies weak governance and
pervasive corruption as the major obstacles to improving the business climate and eliminating
poverty. It points to limited government effectiveness and inadequate regulatory quality as
the main factors inhibiting private sector development. It notes that controlling corruption is
the most pressing governance challenge for Albania, pointing to pervasive state capture and
the infiltration of criminal elements in state entities.

To address these challenges the CAS urges the development of a comprehensive reform
agenda, centered on improving governance and strengthening institutions. While governance
is not specifically addressed in this project, it aimed at strengthening public sector institutions
to ensure appropriate implementation of such comprehensive reforms as a medium term
expenditure framework and civil service reform.

3.2 Achievement of Project Development Objectives
(including brief discussion of causal linkages between outputs and outcomes, with details on
outputs in Annex 2)

Notwithstanding adjustments in spending categories, the delays in implementation, and the
challenges posed by an ambitious public administration reform effort under the circumstances
of transition, the Project appears to have largely achieved its project development objectives
for the following reasons:

Public Expenditure: The project was instrumental in initiating the Medium Term
Expenditure Framework (MTEF) process in Albania. The MTEF process was based on
discussion during the preparation of this project. During implementation, by establishing
close linkages with the activities financed by both the World Bank (Structural Adjustment
Credit, PRSC series, Public Expenditure and Institutional Review) and other development
partners (primarily DFID), the project helped create momentum for the MTEF process. In
addition, the number of ministries that prepared sector strategies linking expenditures to
strategies increased from 4 in the 2001-03 MTBP to 10 in draft 2006-08 MTBP1. A technical
assistance for macroeconomic and fiscal analysis supported by this project developed an
input-output model for better economic forecasting. The project helped prepare a
comprehensive set of implementing regulations for the application of the procurement law.

Key indicators of institutional performance show encouraging trends. The fiscal aggregates
generally improved, revenue predictability was enhanced, and inflation rate remained stable at
a low level. Improvement in revenue predictability suggests strengthened capacity for
macroeconomic and fiscal analysis. Some indications of improvements in public procurement
are also reported in Table 1.

The capacity for budget management and execution is expected to be further strengthened
when the full-scale operation of the Treasury System starts. While the project successfully
installed a fully functional treasury system against significant challenges e.g. limited IT
capacity (infrastructure, IT team/staff) and short time frame, its full impact on budget
execution is yet to materialize. The system is still in a trial phase. The MoF is also running the
new system in parallel to the existing system. It is expected to be fully operational in January
2008. Strong commitment and continuous effort of the Government to roll out this system are
critical to ensure sustainability and success of the system.

Human Resource Management: The implementation of the new Civil Service Law (CSL)
and instituting an improved human resource management practice are uneven. Achievements
made in the early stage of project implementation were severely tested when the new
Government was formed in 2005. The incoming Government carried out a retrenchment of
more than 600 staff (over 30 percent of the existing staff) in 11 ministries. A number of these
have been challenged in the appeals process and in the courts. As such, the project can be
viewed as succeeding in establishing an institutional framework in which the basic principle
of due process and reduced arbitrariness appear to have withstood this significant challenge.
Following intense policy dialogue with the Bank and close scrutiny of the DPL program, the
new Government has reiterated its commitment to preserve the autonomy of the civil service
and its depoliticization. All key political parties have expressed support for the aims of the
law and appear on balance to accept its provisions.

The Project directly contributed to creating and nurturing a small civil service cadre hired
through largely transparent processes. The proportion of central administration employees
appointed based on the CSL has steadily increased. Various technical assistance provided by
this project helped control overall public sector employment cost and at the same time
increase its relative attractiveness vis--vis private sector opportunities and provide better
public services. Functional reviews of government institutions and agencies were conducted
with recommendations for restructured public administration. Table 2 shows some of the key
indicators of institutional performance relevant to human resource management.

The retrenchment which took place in 2005-2006 exposed a number of worrying signs in the
future of the CSL including: (i) non-compliance with the procedures in the CSL; (ii) lack of
consultation with DoPA on actions taken in some ministries; and (iii) increased application of
appointments on temporary contracts for new positions created. In January and February 2006
the Civil Service Commission (CSC) received 278 complaints, equal to the average over a full
year. As of March 2006, in 67 percent of the cases the CSC has decided in favor of the
appellant. The findings of the CSC indicate that the procedure for removal of staff was not in
compliance with the CSL and that the grounds for removal were lacking (i.e. the decision was
taken without a proper assessment of performance or did not follow the CSL regarding
restructuring of positions). In addition, cross ministerial influence of DoPA over civil service
issues was undermined by the decision of the new Government to transfer it from Prime
Minster's office to the Ministry of Interior. The Government attributes most of the changes to
the new philosophy of smaller government based partly on the functional reviews supported
by this project. These changes may be part of normal course of transition experienced in
comprehensive civil service reforms in many countries.

Policy Formulation: The project has positively contributed to improving policy formulation
by improving the Government's capacity to manage foreign aid and by supporting the
Department for Policy Development and Coordination. A key output under this component is
the Integrated Planning System (IPS), which was approved by the Council of Ministers
(CoM) in April 2005. The IPS constitutes a broad planning and monitoring framework
designed to ensure that the Government of Albania's core policy and financial processes
function in a coherent, efficient and integrated manner. It provides a mechanism to integrate
the planning and budgeting processes encompassing the National Strategy for Social and
Economic Development (NSSED), the MTBP and the annual budget cycle. It would also help
manage sectoral policies and foreign aid and by supporting the Department for Policy
development and Coordination.

Two core processes that cover all government organizations and activities include: (i)
National Strategy for Development and Integration (NSDI); and (ii) MTEF (Medium-Term
Budget Program (MTBP) in Albania). The IPS aims to provide a set of operating principles
and supporting structures to ensure that government planning and monitoring as a whole takes
place in as efficient and harmonized way as possible. Strong commitment has been expressed
by the Government and a number of development partners. A multi-donor trust fund has been
established in the World Bank to support its implementation after the completion of this
project.

3.3 Efficiency
(Net Present Value/Economic Rate of Return, cost effectiveness, e.g., unit rate norms, least
cost, and comparisons; and Financial Rate of Return)

As an institution-building project, quantitative computations of rates of return are not
applicable.

3.4 Justification of Overall Outcome Rating
(combining relevance, achievement of PDOs, and efficiency)

Rating: Moderately Unsatisfactory

The achievements highlighted above have positively impacted on laying the base for: (i)
improved policy formulation, analysis and coordination; (ii) professional, merit-based civil
service and increased accountability; and (iii) improved policy and program implementation.
While this ICR recognizes the achievements made against difficult circumstances, the project
was not able to fully consolidate the expected benefits from the Treasury System



                                                13

implementation, the largest sub-component of the project. The effort to develop the database
for the Human Resource Management System has been halted. The DoPA, the key
organization in CSL implementation, is facing severe challenges due to factors exogenous to
the project. Therefore, it rates the overall outcome as Moderately Unsatisfactory.

A concerted effort was made to provide effective support to strengthen the capacity of budget
formulation, macroeconomic and fiscal analysis, and MoF's general management capacity by
linking a number of ongoing activities financed by the Bank and other donors. Institutional
performance indicators on policy and public expenditure management show generally positive
trend.

The project helped implement a Civil Service Law that is consistent with good international
practice and has significantly improved civil service management practices in an environment
where none existed before. These practices fundamentally changed the behavior and the
practices and the incentive structure of politicians (ministers) in hiring and firing decisions. It
created an environment governed by due process, which -by and large- is being followed.
This is a sharp contrast with the situation before the implementation of the law in which
employees, independently of their rank, function or performance were at risk of arbitrary
termination by those more powerful or better placed than them, and appointment process was
not very transparent. The project managed to support the implementation of fundamental
reforms despite a very polarized and tense political environment, limited institutional
capacity, and several changes in heads of key implementing agencies.

Despite these achievements, the project experienced a number of setbacks over the course of
its implementation. The Treasury System, which became the dominant component of the
project in the latter part of project implementation, became operational only in March 2007.
The system is not yet ready to serve as the solid foundation for expenditure management. A
component which was added to the project in the later stages of implementation -the Human
Resource Management System- which would have provided institutional capacity to
effectively monitor human resources has not, to date been successfully implemented. Implicit
weakening of DoPA's influence over management and control of civil service issues could
have lasting impact on overall public sector human resource management. Despite World
Bank efforts to prevent this move, the Department of Public Administration has been
downgraded over the past eighteen months by moving it from the Prime Ministry to the
Department of Interior. The experience of the past eighteen months suggests that DoPA is
tangential to the Ministry's main priorities of security and decentralization.             In this
environment, the ability of the department to ensure respect of the human resource rules and
regulations across ministries has been negatively impacted.

As indicated in the PAD, this is the first phase of a longer-term reform. International
experience suggests that the implementation of institutional reforms of this kind is hardly ever
linear. Despite the shortcomings in fully achieving the objectives at project closure, with
strong commitment by the Government, it is possible that the project could constitute the
beginning of a long period of improvement in public administration.

3.5 Overarching Themes, Other Outcomes and Impacts
(if any, where not previously covered or to amplify discussion above)

(a) Poverty Impacts, Gender Aspects, and Social Development

There is no direct poverty, gender or social impact on the population. Indirectly however, the
project has contributed to better managed resource allocation through strengthened budget
formulation and analytical capacity, to improved policy coordination and execution for
effective management of the economic growth and poverty reduction strategies, as well as



                                                14

other social and economic programs. An effective and functional Treasury System will
enhance the transparency of budget execution and reduces fiduciary risks.

(b) Institutional Change/Strengthening
(particularly with reference to impacts on longer-term capacity and institutional
development)

The capacity of the Ministry of Finance to formulate the budget based on sound analysis was
greatly improved as a result of the project's support. In particular, the successful and ongoing
implementation of a MTEF is likely to have a long term effect on this department capacity
and institutional development. Once the Treasury System becomes fully operational as
expected in 2008, it will serve as the foundation for strong budget execution capability.

The project successfully undertook functional reviews of different departments, which in
some instances, were implemented by ministries over the past several months. The number of
ministries in Albania was reduced from 18 to 14. These changes are expected, in some
instances, to improve the government's ability to successfully implement policy.

Finally, the IPS that was developed, with support of the project, is likely to make positive
contribution to improving policy formulation. The IPS successfully transitioned the change of
Governments in 2005 and has generated support from a substantial number of development
partners who are prepared to support the IPS implementation through a multi-donor trust fund
established in the World Bank.

Outcomes and impacts of the project were within expected range.

3.6 Summary of Findings of Beneficiary Survey and/or Stakeholder Workshops

The World Bank Albania Country Team organized on January 28 and 29, 2007 a Joint
learning event with the Government of Albania on issues of Governance and anti-corruption
which are at the center of the activities under review by the project. The complete transcript
of the proceeding is provided as reference in annex 6, along with a complete list of
participants. Below are the relevant findings of this workshop

There is broad consensus across the political spectrum that the efforts undertaken to create a
professional, depoliticized civil service in Albania are positive and need to be fostered and
preserved. There is a broad acknowledgement that despite some perceived weaknesses, the
CSL is a positive step forward, and that the outcomes of the changes in terms of efficacy of
government resulting from the implementation of these reforms has been positive. The
opposition and the Government are united in asserting that the autonomy of the civil service
and its de-politicization must be preserved.

Yet, opposition and the Government now disagree on whether the reforms to date have
achieved appropriate level of de-politicization. The present Government, upon assuming
power, dismissed a large number of people within the civil service, the Customs and the Tax
Authority. These changes have been bitterly opposed by the opposition which considers them
politically motivated and in direct contradiction to both the spirit and the letter of the Civil
Service Act.

During his intervention, the Prime Minister indicated his government's sentiments that the
current administrative system and the present Civil Service Law, while a good start, could be
improved. Additionally, he indicated government's concern that in the present circumstances,
the civil service cannot attract or retain qualified staff. The Prime Minister confirmed the


                                               15

strong determination of his government to foster decentralization and he highlighted the
marked increases in fiscal transfers from the Central Government to local governments in the
last two budgets. Nonetheless, there must be a more orderly and accountable process to civil
service changes, and for a more comprehensive approach to support decentralization.        The
Prime Minister stressed that corruption remains a very important issue negatively affecting
the development in Albania. He reaffirmed his commitment to root out corruption and his
government's "zero tolerance" for organized crime, nepotism and corruption, especially
within public administration. He reviewed progress made by the Government in its first 15
months in office in the fight against crime, budget reforms, reducing informality and fostering
decentralization.

Civil service reform and the retrenchments that took place in the wake of the changes which
brought the current majority into power have received a lot of attention and discussion during
the Learning event. The Opposition indicated that most of those changes were politically
motivated and impacted not only the civil service but also many other branches of public
administration. The Government attributed most of the changes to the new philosophy of
smaller government which resulted in reducing the number of ministries from 18 to 14 and
then following the recommendations of the "functional review" for government institutions
and agencies which aimed at streamlining operations and organizational structures across the
public administration. Further reforms of the civil service remain contentious and continued
discussion of this agenda, encompassing the majority, the opposition, representatives of the
donor community and civil society, is needed.

Participants agreed that governance matters to Albania and it is crucial that the World Bank
remain engaged on this important agenda to support national efforts. The Governance Filter
(GF) in the CAS is important for raising development effectiveness of the World Bank
support program and it was agreed that it has brought more rigor and focus to the support
program to the Country. Going forward, participants affirmed the importance of upgrading our
knowledge base through more analytical work on Governance and Anti Corruption (GAC). It
was also suggested that the World Bank program has to be flexible, innovative and pragmatic
in its entry points to support GAC agenda. The highest priority should be given to building
core government systems to reduce the scope for abuse and corruption. The World Bank
Group should also focus on supporting a smaller and effective government by enhancing
further efforts for liberalization and privatization. Within sectors, strategies have to be
prepared with more focus on service delivery improvements (e.g., health sector).

Participants agreed that public administrative reforms are most difficult. The developments in
this sector call for a renewed emphasis on de-politicization and relative autonomy of the civil
service. The agenda requires broader national consensus and the Government by itself cannot
achieve progress. The World Bank will continue its support provided that the process of
national debate and consensus building (particularly among political parties) is initiated.
Finally, participants confirmed the importance of continuing to establish baselines and
databases to continuously monitor progress and results in the area of GAC.

4. Assessment of Risk to Development Outcome

Rating: High

The sustainability of project achievements and thus the Development Outcome at this stage
remains difficult to assess. There are two significant arguments to maintain an optimistic
outlook about the sustainability of the Development Outcome  Firstly, the Civil Service law,
while having been significantly tried by the change to government, when the law was
implemented, appears to have survived as a safeguard for due process. The new Government
has indicated its willingness to observe the redress mechanisms for civil servants, and the
respect for the process, highlighted by the law, has restored some integrity to the law.


                                              16

Secondly, the budget formulation process and analytical capability, strengthened through the
project, will serve as the core foundation for appropriate fiscal management. The
implementation of IPS will also contribute to longer term strategic investment planning and
execution.

On the other hand, there are significant risks to the development outcomes as well. The
Government has indicated its intention to amend the Civil Service Law. Any change in the
law which does not have a widespread consensus is likely to prejudice its implementation.
The Civil Service Law only affects a very small portion of total Government employment, but
any expansion in its application cannot proceed well without improving the personnel
performance evaluation system.       Providing employment guarantees without an adequate
evaluation system provides an opportunity to make political appointments and protect them
from changes in governing majorities. Any expansion of this law without significantly
improving the performance evaluation system will certainly ensure that any hiring undertaken
by this majority will be overturned by the next government.

While the Treasury Management is now functional, its final impact on budget execution at
this stage is difficult to assess. The system has been operational only since March 2007. The
Treasury Department is currently running the system in parallel with the previous system, and
the full operation is planned from January 2008. The implementation of the system is at a
critical juncture. As is usually expected in any large scale information system implementation,
there will be technical adjustments needed to address user needs and local environment. The
most critical action required at this stage of implementation is clear commitment from the
senior leadership of the organization to sustain and operationalize the system. It would entail,
among others, visible demonstration of support for the system and allocating adequate
resource for technical support and other adjustments.

The HRMS supported by this project is also in a similar state while leadership support in this
case is visibly weak. The project successfully created a workable tool to facilitate human
resource management process for public sector organizations and agencies. Institutional
commitment would be required to reactivate the database development process.

5. Assessment of Bank and Borrower Performance
(relating to design, implementation and outcome issues)

5.1 Bank Performance

(a) Bank Performance in Ensuring Quality at Entry
(i.e., performance through lending phase)

Rating: Moderately Unsatisfactory

The Bank was proactive in supporting the Government in the design of the Civil Service Law,
the strengthening of the public administration department and in supporting the Human
Resource Management process as a whole. It provided very adequate resources to intensely
support a massive reform program and adequately staffed the team to support the effort. It
successfully pursued donor coordination and cooperation and established excellent working
relationships with the counterparts both at the technical and the political level. Project
implementation experience suggests that given the capacity constraints and the complex
environment, a more focused operation including fewer, better linked components would have
been preferable.

The identification and the support of enabling Information Technology Systems (such as the
Treasury System and the Human Resource Management System) were less successful.



                                               17

Realistic assessment of the scope of work required in these components became apparent
during project implementation stage. The lack of adequate IT resources in Albania became
additional challenge for the project. Under these circumstances, the identification and hiring
of appropriately qualified IT staff, the completion of a suitable and acceptable conceptual
design by consultants, and the effective establishment of coordination and project
management mechanisms should have occurred ahead of Board Approval.

Alternatively the implementation time for the project should have been lengthened to allow
for the proper identification and preparation of the project to be completed. Failure to take
these steps severely affected the subsequent implementation of the project and led to
significant delays.

(b) Quality of Supervision
(including of fiduciary and safeguards policies)

Rating: Satisfactory

The Bank involved a very adequate mixture of headquarters and field based staff for
supervision. The project was supported in the early stages by a full-time field based Public
Sector Specialist and at the later stages, with IT staff monitoring project implementation. In
addition the project benefited for most of the time during the implementation of two full time
public sector specialists, a public sector management specialist (informatics), and a
procurement specialist, and other high level staff at different times of implementation."

The team was proactive in managing and attempting to find solutions to the challenges that
arose during implementation, among them the inadequate funding for the Treasury
Management System and the complex implementation of this component.

Project supervision was reviewed by the Quality Assessment Group (QAG) in 2004 which
rated supervision Highly Satisfactory, pointing to its considerable knowledge of the country
and the sector/project, the high degree of staff continuity and the use of resources of field-
based Bank staff/expertise, without reliance on outside consultants or resort to trust funds.

With intensive effort by the team and strong commitment of the Borrower, the Treasury
System became operational shortly after project closure. Whether this system can have an
impact on enhancing budget execution practice depends on the results of the efforts currently
being made by the MoF to bring the system into full implementation nationwide. There is a
question as to whether the project should have been extended further for the Bank to provide
timely support at this critical juncture.

(c) Justification of Rating for Overall Bank Performance

Rating: Moderately Satisfactory

Given a difficult reform program in a very challenging and complex political environment,
the project succeeded in completing the envisaged activities albeit with delay. During
implementation, it proactively addressed the design problems and succeeded in pushing the
process ahead.




                                               18

5.2 Borrower Performance
(a) Government Performance

Rating: Moderately Satisfactory

As expected, given the nature of the Albanian polity, government performance was not
linearly successful, but on the whole positive.

In the wake of the 1997 crisis, the government courageously undertook to implement a
comprehensive reform program aimed at improving public sector management.                       It
aggressively passed a significant number of key legislation aimed at instituting an enabling
legislative environment for the implementation of reforms ahead of Board Approval. It
supported the implementation of these reforms by adequately staffing the executing agencies.

Over the course of implementation, the Government's commitment to the project was
sometimes ambivalent. Implementation of the Civil Service Law was frequently hampered by
the use of temporary contract hiring, in contravention of the law. Additionally, in 2005, the
change in government tested the implementation of the Civil Service law and reversed some
of the project's achievement and cast a significant doubt on the sustainability of the reforms.
The implementation of the Treasury System component faced various challenges.

The recent events in 2007, leading to the approval of the Development Policy Loan seem to
indicate a potentially renewed commitment on the part of the Government to the objectives of
the project and to the successful implementation of the reforms.

(b) Implementing Agency or Agencies Performance

Rating: Moderately Satisfactory

The unit entrusted with the project implementation Unit for Implementation of the Public
Administration Reform Program (UIPARP) on the whole successfully managed the project's
procurement process.

The Department of Public Administration (DoPA) was a very successful department while in
the Council of Ministers, appropriately executing the reform, undertaking civil service
management control adequately.        Despite objections by the Bank and other donors, its
effectiveness was significantly eroded by the dismantlement of the Council of Ministers and
the consequent placement of this Department within the Ministry of Interior. Over the past
eighteen months, the unit has been unable to perform its duties adequately, hampered by both
practical difficulties, such as the absence of a physical office, the lack of internet connection,
and institutional neglect within the Ministry of Interior. This situation has affected project
implementation of the Human Resource Management Agenda and especially the successful
implementation of the Human Resource management system.

The Ministry of Finance had a difficult time over the life of the project implementing the
Treasury Management System, due to the lack of institutional capacity within the ministry to
handle the implementation of a complex IT-based treasury management system. While the
team managed to complete the system ahead of project closure, sustaining this system remains
to be a challenge.




                                               19

(c) Justification of Rating for Overall Borrower Performance

Rating: Moderately Satisfactory

The borrower has undertaken a complex reform program in a difficult environment. The
divided nature of the Albanian polity has had repercussion on a very sensitive program.
Public Administration continued to be the forum for the majority and opposition to clash.
Despite this situation, subsequent governments have overall manifested their support for
reform while incurring significant delays in implementation.

6. Lessons Learned

The Bank's role in promoting public administration reform in accession countries is
delicate and essential but requires very strong coordination with other development donors,
especially the EU. The Bank's influence, already quite strong in the area of governance
reform is sometimes enhanced when countries begin the EU accession process; especially
when it employs policy lending instruments in tandem with investment/TA lending. While
coordination between the EU and the Bank works generally well, with the EU looking to the
Bank to support its work on Public Administration Reform, the impact of dissonant
perspectives between the Bank and the EU can have negative impacts on the implementation
of institutional reforms In this instance, the European Union's strong endorsement of the
Government's efforts in addressing corruption in the customs and tax authorities was
interpreted as an endorsement to violate the legal safeguards protecting civil servants from
firings.   As a result, frequent and close coordination is required between the Bank's
implementation level activities and the EU's broader governance and political discussions to
ensure that the messages that are sent are not mis-interpreted.

Maintaining a narrow focus on the development objectives and the project design ensures
improved supervision and allows better utilization of supervision resources.               In this
instance, including a treasury management system into what was essentially a civil service
project, did not produce the desired increased cooperation between DOPA and the Ministry of
Finance, and instead added complexity into project implementation, which may have caused
delay in the project. It also increased the need for disparate skills within the supervision team.
In this context it is important to note that the Bank tends to make standard allocations for
supervision notwithstanding the project's complexity. Additionally, because the treasury
system was embedded as a portion of a bigger project, it was hard to get the required
governmental attention to its problems.

A divided polity requires ensuring commitment and ownership for reforms that goes beyond
the Government. During the preparation, the team adequately assessed commitment of the
Government to the reform, and got excellent cooperation in return. This ensured that the first
several years of implementation of the project proceeded smoothly. Yet the reform could
have benefited from the buy-in of the then leading party in the opposition. This, given the
DP's boycott of the Parliament would have been difficult, in all likelihood, would have
potentially increased the preparation time for the project, and fewer reforms would have been
achieved, but it could also have ensured that when the opposition took power, the backlash
could have been less severe. If strengthening of the public administration is to go forward in
Albania, reforms undertaken need to have bipartisan support and ownership.                    The
establishment of a separate commission to deal with public administration reform within the
Parliament is potentially one way to ensure that this ownership is achieved.

Complementarity with adjustment operations has positive effects which should continue to
be pursued. The twinning of investment and policy-based operations worked well in the
public administration reform project, especially at the end of the implementation phase. In a
country with limited capacity, the investment operations provided the capacity building,


                                               20

transfer of resources, and implementation push, while the adjustment operation provided the
impetus to ensure that difficult cross-cutting and policy agenda items were achieved. This
was the case, for example, in ensuring that the adverse effects on the integrity and
independence of the civil service resulting from the arrival to power of the new government
were mitigated.

Difficult automation projects, such as the Treasury Management System require adequate
project planning ahead of implementation, especially in terms of properly identifying
accompanying reforms, human resource requirements, capacity building requirements and
other peripheral issues. This reduces the risks of delays and reduces the costs requirements
for such investments. International experience in implementation of core systems seems to
indicate that resource allocation for implementation of these systems is consistently
underestimated in developing world environment, especially where there are capacity
constraints as in the case of Albania. When countervailing reasons to proceed with the project,
despite lack of preparation for IT elements in a project, project design should take these
deficiencies into account and ensure the project implementation appropriately sequences
preparation activities and the implementation period is lengthened to ensure appropriate
implementation of the project.

7. Comments on Issues Raised by Borrower/Implementing Agencies/Partners
(a) Borrower/implementing agencies

During his intervention in the January stakeholder workshop, the Prime Minister pointed out
that there are some weaknesses in the current system and the Civil Service Law. Additionally,
he highlighted his concern that the civil service cannot attract or retain qualified staff to it.
The number of applicants was systematically monitored throughout the life of the project.
This data seems to indicate that the number of applicants tended to increase during the life of
the project, seemingly indicating that Civil Service positions were considered attractive by the
general population.

With regards to the Civil Service Law, the comments received from the Ministry of Interior
note that due to overall positive achievements made, the assessment for the CSL
subcomponent should be higher than Moderately Satisfactory. The comments further note that
the retrenchment occurred as a consequence of the structural changes of the line ministries.
This ICR concurs that positive achievements were made, and that the existing law can be
improved to further clarify the modalities for appeal against administrative decisions which is
currently solved by referencing it to Civil Procedure Law as well as to address the rigidity in
recruitments which does not enable the prompt recruitment of civil servants. Finally the
remedies foreseen in the law for unlawful decisions concerning recruitment can be further
strengthened as today they consist essentially in being placed on a waiting list in the unlikely
event a new position opens up. As for the subcomponent to strengthen DoPA, Ministry of
Interior's comments note the time constraint and positive progress in the reforms directed and
managed by DoPA. The assessment of this ICR is based on the level of achievements made
compared to the original intention to strengthen DoPA as well as incomplete implementation
of HRMS.

The process of evaluating and discussing possible reforms to this sensitive area require
dialogue which encompasses representatives of the entire political spectrum and could
potentially include representatives of civil servants themselves. Moreover, any changes in the
law should follow a significant improvement in those areas in which implementation has been
lacking, especially in the area of performance evaluation.

The comments submitted by the IT Department of the Ministry of Finance, which managed
the Treasury System subcomponent, note diverse challenges they faced including availability
of necessary skills, infrastructure, and time, and commendable efforts made by the team for


                                                21

the implementation of this subcomponent. This ICR recognizes the achievements made by the
team which enabled the Treasury System to become operational shortly after the closure of
this project despite these challenges.

(b) Cofinanciers

UNDP, DFID, SIDA, EC and other development partners have commended the Bank on its
leadership role in following up on public administration reform. This support was expressed
by the provision of a Trust Fund for training of MoF staff, and the commitment to establish a
MDTF in support of the implementation of the IPS.

It was planned that the Swedish International Development Cooperation Agency (SIDA)
supports the implementation of information and communication technology (ICT) training
through a trust fund (Grant No. TF055990). A grant provided through this trust fund was to
provide support to enhance the ICT knowledge and competence within the MoF and DoPA.
More specifically, the trust fund was expected to provide professional ICT training of
designated staff in the MoF and DoPA to administer information technology systems,
including training on relational databases outside of Albania and on-site technical training.
The Grant became effective on February 28, 2006. The original grant amount was SEK
1,791,700. However, the Grant had to be cancelled because: (a) there were delays in the
recruitment of IT staff; (b) relevant positions were filled by temporary staff instead of civil
servants as was originally intended; and (c) the remaining time was too short to conduct this
training.

(c) Other partners and stakeholders
(e.g. NGOs/private sector/civil society)

During the ICR mission, as well as during the subsequent stakeholder's meeting, the team
consulted a number of Parliamentarians and asked them to discuss the outcome of the project.
During those meetings, many MPs indicated that the Bank should have consulted with
Parliament more systematically in the preparation of the loan and during its implementation.

International experience does indeed suggest that in order to create enabling conditions for
consensus building and political will, it is necessary to widen the scope of consultations
across all sectors, not just focusing on Government alone. The continued support for the Civil
Service Law, in particular by the current President of the Republic, and by a large number of
the MPs in many different political parties indicates that adequate political support for the law
can be generated outside of the government.

Annex 2. Outputs by Component

1.        Public Expenditure Management: Moderately Unsatisfactory

1.1. Strengthen the strategic focus of the budget formulation: Satisfactory

The stated objectives of this subcomponent were largely achieved. Much of the support for
designing and implementing the Medium-Term Expenditure Framework (MTEF) was
provided either directly by Bank staff (e.g. through the Public Expenditure and Institutional
Review  PEIR (2001)) or through DFID-financed consultants. The project was instrumental
in initiating this process. The key technical assistance activity planned under this component
was dropped as part of the restructuring in 2004.

The Bank team effectively built on past work in this area including Public Expenditure
Support Credit (1999) and a Structural Adjustment Credit (1999) in addition to PEIR (Box 1).
These complementary sets of technical assistance helped the Government to design and
implement the initial two rounds of a MTEF. As part of the Project, a consultancy service
contract to provide support and assistance to the MoF and line ministries in deepening and
strengthening the MTEF was envisioned. The procurement of this contract was announced
and proposals were received from three bidders. However, since the price offered by all
bidders substantially exceeded the budget amount and DFID financing became available, this
tender was cancelled. The amount allocated for this contract was subsequently reallocated to
the treasury system component. Substantial efforts were made, with successful outcome, to
link the MTEF process based on three-year rolling plan and the Integrated Planning System
(IPS) based on planning for longer time horizon. More information on achievements made in
the development and implementation of the IPS is presented in the section under Policy
Formulation component (Component 3).


                                   Box 1: MTEF and Budget Formulation

   During the period under review, the Government has undertaken seven cycles of its Medium Term Budget
   Process (MTBP), and it has institutionalized it by making it an integral part of its National Strategy for Social
   and Economic Development (NSSED), linking the planning of priorities with appropriate budgeting over the
   short to medium-term. In 2004, the MoF started issuing a budget circular to help prepare the 2005 budget
   based on the 2005-07 MTBP. The number of ministries that prepared sector strategies linking expenditures to
   strategies increased from four in the 2001-03 MTBP to ten in draft 2006-08 MTBP according to the ICR for
   PRSC 3. A Public Investment Identification and Appraisal Cycle (PIIAC) Manual was issued together with
   the Budget Circular by MoF at the end of May 2004. The Budget process has become more transparent, and
   information is readily available to the public through Government's efforts to make document available to
   members of Parliament for scrutiny and by publishing the MTBP on the MoF website. The status of the
   Budget Department was upgraded to that of a General Department to increase its authority and roles in the
   process of analyses, formulation and management of budget.




1.2 Strengthen treasury functions: Moderately Unsatisfactory

With regards to budget execution the project's ability to achieve its development objectives
remains in doubt and accordingly should be rated moderately unsatisfactory.

This subcomponent went through major reorganization during project implementation and it
evolved into the dominant part of the project for the latter part of project implementation. A
careful assessment of the cost of this activity revealed that it would require considerably
larger financial resource than originally anticipated. Due to recognition that treasury



                                                       24

modernization is an essential complement to the budget formulation reforms, a decision was
taken between the Borrower and the Bank to increase the allocation for this subcomponent by
making use of the "unallocated" funds, reductions in scope of work under other contracts, and
the use of remaining funds in the Recovery Program Technical Assistance Project (RPTAC).
Additionally at the time of mid-term review in May-June 2003, it was recognized that the
implementation of the reforms and the development of the system would entail an extension
in the project timeline.

The development of the Treasury System was planned to be implemented in four stages
including: (i) preparatory studies for system design and development of single-entry Ledger
and related data warehouse ("Quick-Wins"); (ii) implementation of Quick-Wins using an
intranet link between the MoF and the Tirana Treasury Office; (iii) parameterization and
acquisition of the Treasury System to be implemented nationwide; and (iv) implementation of
the Treasury System. The Quick-Wins were developed and piloted successfully in Tirana
Treasury Office, but as it was designed as a simple piloting tool, it was not possible to scale it
up for wider use. The full-scale Treasury System became operational two months after the
closing of the project. It was envisaged during the discussion for restructuring that the
technical installation would be completed around July 2006. Therefore, this is a delay of
about seven months. The implementation was completed within revised budget. Original
technical design was expanded considerably to accommodate current functional needs and to
support future requirements. The system is currently running in parallel with the old system
and full nationwide operation is planned to begin from early 2008.

The system became operational only recently (March 2007) and therefore its impact on
budget execution is too early to emerge. As part of this subcomponent, an upgrade of the
Government's debt management and financial analysis system (DMFAS v.5.3) was also
implemented. Interfaces with external systems including those of the customs, tax, Bank of
Albania, and DMFAS were developed.

After the completion of the project, key challenges to ensure strengthening of budget
execution through the use of the newly introduced Treasury System include whether the
Government succeed in: (i) providing adequate institutional support for sustaining the system;
(ii) building adequate IT capacity within MoF through hiring of IT specialists to better
interact with the suppliers and develop system management skills; and (iii) making interfaces
with external systems fully operational. At this critical juncture of system roll out, firm
commitment and support from the MoF senior management is strongly needed. With regard
to (ii), the Bank provided continuous advice to create an adequately housed, furnished and
staffed Information Technology Department since the preparation stage. The IT Department
was created in MoF, but throughout the project implementation, the IT Department continued
to suffer from understaffing. This is due partly to difficulty in retaining highly skilled
personnel.

1.3 Strengthen macroeconomic and fiscal analysis: Satisfactory

In terms of macro-economic and fiscal analysis, the results are satisfactory. The major work
under this subcomponent, a technical assistance for macroeconomic and fiscal analysis, was
completed before the restructuring. As a result of this technical assistance, an input-output
model for better economic forecasting was developed. It provides a tool for the MoF for
producing tax-specific revenue projections by sector. It also allows analysis of the impact of
additional production by sector, or expenditures of various types in policy analysis and cost-
benefit analysis. The overall average accuracy of revenue predictions as measured by the
percentage of deviation of actual from projected revenues improved from -6.35 percent in
1999, a year before the MTBP process was introduced, to -1.10 percent in 2005.




                                              25

1.4 Strengthen accounting function: Moderately satisfactory

In terms of strengthening accounting function, the results are moderately satisfactory. The
original allocation for this subcomponent was US$0.46 million. The support for the
Accounting Department was provided through technical assistance (US$55,000) for the
consolidation of the disparate accountancy systems in place at the time. This activity was
introduced also to help the Government meet one of the PRSC conditions. The
recommendations on the accounting system provided through this assistance were
incorporated into the designing of the Treasury System.

1.5 Strengthen general management capacity: Moderately Satisfactory

In terms of strengthening MoF public expenditure management functions the project outcome
is moderately satisfactory. A functional review of the Ministry of Finance was undertaken as
part of overall functional reviews conducted under Component 2. Job descriptions and
classifications for each department were prepared; technical/professional skills according to
the needs of each department were identified and the departments for the most part were
appropriately staffed; the internal audit function within the Ministry of Finance was
successfully reviewed and improved; the annual assessment of Ministry of Finance's activities
and results are duly published on the Ministry's website. Training to develop and provide
training required to strengthen general management capacities within the MoF was delivered.

The information technology department in the Ministry of Finance has been set up, although
with long delays and difficulty. While the IT needs assessment was successfully undertaken,
the identification of adequate staff was drawn out. The Government faced tremendous
challenges in hiring and retaining adequate IT skills. To address this challenge, the
Government made a decision in 2005 to increase the salary of IT specialists at all the
ministries to provide incentive to stay. In spite of this measure, difficulty still persists. As for
this project, the need to strengthen IT capacity within MOF was critical for effective
implementation of the Treasury System subcomponent. The delay associated with the
adequate staffing of this department affected the implementation of the Treasury System.

1.6 Strengthen procurement policies and practices: Moderately unsatisfactory

The project provided support for technical assistance through consultancy service. This
assistance helped prepare a comprehensive set of implementing regulations, which would
underpin and clarify the application of the procurement law, and a set of standard bidding
documents and standard forms of contract for the procurement of goods, civil works and
services, as well as a User's Manual to offer public officials guidance on their applications,
and the Standard Bidding Documents. A series of procurement training courses for staff of the
public Procurement Agency was conducted.

Overall, significant progress was made in improving the legislative framework for public
procurement. A combination of assistance in this area was provided through: (i) this project;
(ii) the Country Procurement Assessment Report (CPAR) which provided recommendations
to strengthen the capacity of the Public Procurement Agency (PPA); and (iii) PRSC-2, which
was instrumental in accomplishing the enactment of the amendment of the Law on Public
Procurement. Transparency was improved through the regular publication of the Public
Procurement Bulletin. Information on procurement legislation, PPA structure, and other
related issues are posted in PPA's website. Statistics indicate that procurement is becoming
more competitive. In 2001, 22 percent of all contracts based on contract value were procured
through international competitive bidding. In 2004, this figure reached 38 percent. The use of


                                               26

national competitive bidding was essentially unchanged, a marginal increase during this
period from 49 percent to 50 percent.

While these achievements are encouraging, there are concerns about the implementation of a
legislative framework. The PPA does not have reliable data on the extent of direct
procurement conducted in the system, and its annual report is not comprehensive, accurate, or
public. The CPAR (2001) had concluded that a good procurement law is being undermined by
poor application and lack of enforcement owing to weakness of the PPA and use of
uncompetitive procurement methods. In 2006, the Country Fiduciary Assessment Update
(CFAU) has found no improvement in this situation. The rating on Competition, value for
money and controls in procurement (Indicator 19) by the Public Expenditure and Financial
Accountability (PEFA) Public Financial Management Assessment is D+ based on its
assessment that: (i) available data shows that less than 50 percent of contracts above the
threshold are awarded on an open competitive basis, but the data may not be accurate (Score
C); (ii) although regulatory environment establishes use of open competition as preferred
method, there are weaknesses in the system that results in overuse of direct procurement
(Score D); and (iii) existing system on complaints review is poorly designed (Score C).

2.       Human Resource Management: Moderately Satisfactory

The implementation of the law is rated moderately satisfactory. The role of DoPA was
strengthened as intended, but the decision taken by the new Government to move this
function from the Council of Ministers to the Ministry of Interior significantly undermined
the achievements made during project implementation. Finally, the development of the
Human Resource Management Information System, an activity which was added as a result of
the mid-term review, has not been achieved.

Subcomponent 1: Implement Civil Service Law (CSL): Moderately Satisfactory

The Law on the Status of the Civil Servant (Civil Service Law  CSL) passed in November
1999 (during the preparation of this Project) is consistent with good international practices,
and Albanian public administration has benefited by the enactment from this law. With this
law, the framework for competitive, transparent recruitment and selection procedures were
put in place. Civil service management practices have been set up and have had a very
important impact on the behavior, the practices and the incentive structure of politicians
(ministers) in hiring and firing decisions. It created due process which by and large, despite
substantial difficulties, is being followed, and replaces the previous system in which any civil
servant, independently of grade or function could be fired at the whim of anyone with
sufficient authority. This is a stark difference from the previous system which was subject to
arbitrary and non-transparent human resource management practice. A large scale
retrenchment conducted after the change in government in September 2005 presented
concerns for the sustainability of the achievements made during the early phase of project
implementation. The general principles put in place by the CSL, nevertheless, appear to have
kept intact throughout these events.

Civil servant intake through competitive process demonstrates improvement. The percentage
of new appointments by contract, a major route for non-competitive intake into government,
fell to 0.3 percent in 2005 (second quarter) from 16 percent in 2001 (fourth quarter). The
number of civil servant positions that were subjected to a performance appraisal improved
from 59 to 89 percent over 2002 and 20042.

Reform Program (UIPARP)


                                                 27

Due process protections were incorporated in the CSL to limit post-political-change turnover
within the civil service. The project supported this process through technical assistance which
provided useful written and oral advice on CSL implementation e.g. pay policy, salary
structure, recruitment system, and communication strategy among others. The Civil Service
reforms were put to a severe test when a total retrenchment of more than 600 staff or over 30
percent of the existing staff in 11 ministries took place after September 2005 (after the change
of Government). The first step for this major downsizing of the public administration was to
reduce the number of ministries from 17 to 14, partly founded upon the assessment supported
by the project (see functional reviews in subcomponent 2). Key concerns revealed in this
process are: (i) non-compliance with the procedures in the CSL for the process of
restructuring or closing of institutions, organizational units or job positions; (ii) lack of
consultation with DoPA during the restructuring process for some ministries (MoF, Ministry
of Interior); and (iii) increased number of application of appointments on temporary contracts
for new positions, many of which were rejected by DoPA. Many complaints were filed to the
Civil Service Commission (CSC). In January and February 2006, the CSC received 278
complaints, equal to the average over a full year. As of March 2006, in 67 percent of the cases
the CSC has decided in favor of the appellant. The findings of the CSC indicate that the
procedure for removal of staff was not in compliance with the CSL and that the grounds for
removal were lacking (i.e. the decision was taken without a proper assessment of performance
or did not follow the CSL regarding restructuring of positions)3. This process is a testimony of
functioning appeal system.

The motivations for these measures have varied. Of relevance in this instance is the
contention from the current government that the employees who were hired as civil servants
were not necessarily hired on the basis of merit, casting some doubt on the impact of the Civil
Service Law. In fact, staff holding positions that became civil service positions after the CSL
was enacted, were confirmed in those positions if they received a "satisfactory" performance
evaluation during the first round of performance evaluations under the CSL. While this is a
fairly weak test of performance and qualifications, it aimed to avoid a full fledged lustration
process, notorious for turning into means of purging a public administration of anyone not
loyal to the party in power.

During implementation period some areas for improvement have become apparent. Among
them, the system of appeal against administrative decisions is too general in the law. It is
solved by referencing it to Civil Procedure Law.                Moreover the Civil Service Law
demonstrates rigidities in its hiring process which prevent the timely hiring of civil servants
when positions open up. Labor contracts which are currently used to address this problem,
when used excessively countermand the law which clearly defines which positions are civil
service positions. Finally the remedies foreseen in the law for unlawful decisions concerning
recruitment are ineffective and consist essentially in being placed on a waiting list in the
unlikely event a new position opens up.

The implementation of the CSL has been subject of review during project implementation.
Changes were contemplated to improve its implementation. As agreed under the PRSC 3,
amendments to the CSL had been agreed and were submitted to Parliament with the aim to:
(a) improve the efficiency of recruitment process; and (b) expand the coverage of the CSL to
include a larger number of positions in central and local government (approximately 7,000
positions would be covered by the CSL). These amendments were under review at the time of



3In 2006, a total of 737 complaints were filed to CSC. While it is not clear whether all of these
complaints were directly linked to the retrenchment took place in 2005, it shows dramatic increase
compared to the number of total complaints filed in 2005 which counted 337. Out of 737, 702 were
resolved, in which 477 (68 percent) were in favor of appellant. 144 cases were referred to the Court of
Appeal of Tirana, which upheld CSC's decisions except for 12 cases.

election in July 2005. However, these amendments were subsequently withdrawn from
Parliament.

Subcomponent 2: Strengthen Department of Public Administration: Unsatisfactory

The project supported improvement of DoPA's capacity through the systematic provision of
long and short term technical assistance to the department. The technical infrastructure-
hardware, software as well as training- were provided, but the building of the database has
been very slow and incomplete and the trial application of the payroll remains incomplete.

The project financed several studies on how to improve management of public administration
in Albania. The project also supported the undertaking of functional reviews of all ministries.
These reviews were intended to analyze the functions of all ministries and their subordinate
units, and to review the capacities and institutional arrangements to discharge of these
functions. The reviews were completed with active participation by the ministries concerned.
The majority of the recommendations were taken into consideration e.g. the proposal to
reduce the number of ministries from 17 to 14 was fully taken into consideration. The
suggestion regarding the number of the General Director positions was partially implemented
(11 out of 20 proposed changes). Additionally, the project supported a first level review of
subordinate institutions, but it was not completed due to a dispute with the consultant and
DoPA's determination that the studies did not address the terms of reference.

While the project succeeded in making positive contribution for most part of project
implementation, over the past eighteen months the progress achieved in strengthening this
department has been reversed by its transfer into the Ministry of Interior. Over this period its
authority has been reduced. In the new structure the department is suffering from neglect,
relegated to inadequate buildings, without proper facilities and with no real influence to affect
changes across departments. The development of the HRMS, which was added to the project
at midterm review, was not implemented in part as a result of DOPA's loss of influence. The
technical infrastructure  hardware and software were provided, but the building of the
database has been very slow and incomplete. The exercise has been halted at the time of the
preparation of this ICR. The trial of the payroll system also remains incomplete.

Sub component 3: Assist in Establishment of Institute for Training in Public Administration
(ITPA): Moderately satisfactory

The Institute for Training in Public Administration (ITPA) made substantive progress during
project implementation. The ITPA implemented its Three Year Strategic Work Plan 2002-
2005, which provided a strategic and integrated approach to the program delivery of the
Institute. ITPA has also developed a strategic vision for development of the institution up to
2015. During 2003, 1,167 civil servants were trained, seventy two courses were developed
and a total of 200 training days were offered. ITPA received assistance from several donors
(SIDA, EU, UNDP). Some technical assistance was provided through advice and
recommendations by the consultant firm hired under the subcomponent 1 (CSL) to ITPA on
the Three-Year Strategic Business Plan and identification of training needs. It was recognized
by the Bank mission in June 2004 that the main constraint to further growth of ITPA was the
lack of its own building, which had to be refurbished at the time. Under the original project
concept, a separate consultancy service to support the strengthening of the ITPA had been
planned ($200,000). In light of a shift in their needs and in response to required increase in
the budget for the Treasury System subcomponent, the Government and IDA agreed to re-
allocate the budget allocated to this sub-component to finance the implementation of the
Treasury System.

3. Policy formulation and coordination component: Satisfactory

The objective of this component was to reduce the number of overlapping and conflicting
strategies and recommendations that seemed to inundate policy makers and prevent them
from achieving coordinated and coherent policy objectives. The project successfully focused
on strengthening policy development and analysis capacity within the Prime Ministry to
undertake this function, specifically through the Department for Policy Development and
Coordination. The technical assistance imparted was quite successful and the team's decision
to delay the implementation of activities in this component until promising enabling
conditions emerged significantly contributed to the success of this component. Through
project assistance the Government developed an Integrated Planning System (IPS), which was
approved by the Council of Ministers (CoM) in April 2005. IPS constitutes a broad planning
and monitoring framework designed to ensure that the Government of Albania's core policy
and financial processes function in a coherent, efficient and integrated manner. Two core
processes that cover all government organizations and activities include: (i) National Strategy
for Development and Integration (NSDI); and (ii) MTEF (Medium-Term Budget Program
(MTBP) in Albania). IPS aims to provide a set of operating principles and supporting
structures to ensure that government planning and monitoring as a whole takes place in as
efficient and harmonized way as possible. Strong commitment has been expressed by the
Government and a number of development partners. This system will be implemented and
expanded over the next few years through US$8 million in technical assistance from various
donors.

4. Project Management: Highly Satisfactory

Normal project management activities were undertaken competently by the PIU in the
Council of Ministers.     The PIU produced excellent quality semi-annual project reports
throughout, which greatly assisted the project's implementation, and clearly informed all
stakeholders on the project and the reform progress. Additionally spot surveys of citizens'
perceptions were successfully undertaken.

                           GOVERNANCE AND ANTI-CORRUPTION

                                     28-29 JANUARY 2007

Exactly after one year of the endorsement of the Board of the Executive Directors for
Albania's CAS (http://sitesources.worldbank.orgINT/Albania/Resources/CAS_English.pdf),
the World Bank Albania Country Team organized a Joint learning event with the Government
of Albania. The learning event aimed to raise the awareness of the Bank country team
members and key government officials of governance challenges in Albania; the Bank
enhanced Governance and Anti-Corruption (GAC) strategy, as well as the Governance Filter
introduced in the Bank 2006 CAS. The event also aimed to deepen knowledge of Bank
colleagues regarding the Government's experience in addressing governance and fighting
corruption and to get a first hand assessment on the effectiveness of the Bank relevant support
programs. The findings of the Joint learning event will be shared with other Country Teams in
ECA region and to be used as an input in the CAS Progress Report for Albania planned in
FY08.4

The Government team was headed by H.E. Prof. Dr. Sali Berisha, the Prime Minister. It
included, H.E. Ilir Rusmali, the Deputy prime Minister, and key cabinet ministers and senior
government advisors. Ms. Orsalia Kalantzopoulos, the Country Director for ECCU4 led the
Bank team in the event. The Bank delegation included the country manager, two sector
managers (ECSPE and ECSPF), core Albania task team leaders and most of the staff in the
World Bank Office, Tirana. A selected number of representatives from the Opposition, the
donor community and civil society organizations participated to the event and provided
interesting and valuable feedback, making this a rare opportunity to have both the opposition
and the majority discussing topics constructively around the same table.

The country team members concluded that the introduction of the GF in the CAS has
improved project quality, strengthened the focus on results and is helping the country team to
strengthen mechanisms for participation, transparency and accountability for every project
and program. Country team members confirmed that the Filter has not increased preparation
time for new projects, but highlighted the major difficulties that have emerged from the loss
of essential capacity in public administration following recent retrenchments in the Civil
Service. The team called for an orderly and accountable process to civil service changes, and
for a more comprehensive approach to support decentralization. The team also assessed
progress in undertaking Economic Sector Work as envisaged in the CAS. Team members
appreciate the programmatic approach of the Public Expenditure and Institutional Review and
poverty work and suggested ways to improve the sequencing of analytical and advisory work
over the next two years to feed into the design of new projects and support programs

In his keynote speech to the Joint Learning Event, Prime Minister Berisha stressed that
corruption is the cancer of development in Albania and elsewhere. He reaffirmed his
commitment to root out corruption and his government's "zero tolerance" for organized crime,
nepotism and corruption.




4The Joint Leaning Event was supported with a grant from the World Bank ECA Knowledge and
Learning Committee.

He reviewed progress made by the Government in its first 15 months in office in the fight
against crime, budget reforms, reducing informality and fostering decentralization. In the
livelily discussions that followed his presentation, the Prime Minister answered questions
from the World Bank staff as well as the representative of Opposition. In his answers he
expressed the frustration of his government with corruption in the legal and judicial system
and in the office of the prospector which prevented his government from pursing cases of
corruption and state capture. He also confirmed the commitment of his government to
preserve the autonomy of the civil service and its depoliticization despite some weaknesses in
the current system and the Civil Service Law. According to him, the civil service cannot
attract or retain qualified staff to its services. He also confirmed the strong determination of
his government to foster decentralization and he highlighted the marked increases in fiscal
transfers from the Central Government to local governments in the last two budgets. During
the same session, the Minister of Education and Sciences, Mr. Genc Pollo, reviewed reforms
undertaken in his ministry to reduce corruption, improve service delivery and outcomes.

Civil service reform and the retrenchments that took place in the last year in the wake of the
changes which brought the current majority in power have received a lot of attention and
discussion during the Learning event. The Opposition indicated that most of those changes
have been politically motivated and impacted not only the civil service but also many other
branches of public administration. The Government attributed most of the changes to the new
philosophy of smaller government which resulted in reducing the number of ministries from
18 to 4 and then following the recommendation of the "functional review" for government
institutions and agencies which aimed at streamlining operations and organizational structures
across the public administration. Further reforms of the civil service remain contentious and
continued discussion of these agenda, encompassing the majority, the opposition,
representatives of the donor community and civil society, is needed.

The second session of the Leaning Event focused on the World Bank new enhanced GAC
strategy for which extensive consultations took place ion Albania in December 2006. This
was followed by presentation on the salient features of the GF of the 2006 CAS as well as the
experiences from other countries with strong emphasis on governance (e.g., Indonesia and
Bangladesh). Lively discussions on global trends in governance and perceptions about
corruption, the role of the Bank in supporting member countries to improve governance
structures and the lessons learnt from other countries and best practices followed the
presentations in this session.

The third session of the program aimed to address three questions: (i) how can the Bank GAC
strategy assist Albania in its implementation of the GAC agenda; (ii) has the CAS Governance
Filter improved development effectiveness of the Bank support program; and (iii) what are the
needed refinements in the Bank CAS? Participants were divided into two groups to enhance
discussions. The outcomes of these deliberations were summarized in the fourth plenary
session.

Overall most participants confirmed the importance of the World Bank support to the
Government efforts to improve governance structures in Albania and the importance of
continuing the engagement on GAC agenda and public sector reforms. A number of proposals
and suggestion were made in the two parallel sessions. These include: (i) the importance of
building country systems (e.g., treasury, procurement, financial management, human
resources management system, one stop shop for business registration,                  etc); (ii)
comprehensive evaluation of corruption in specific sectors (e.g., health sector where many
participants felt the system has failed completely to deliver good public services); (iii) the
Bank should help enhance transparency in decision making by enhancing the debate,
including with opposition, when discussing GAC agenda; (iv) more emphasis on Monitoring
& Evaluation, establishing baselines, and availability of reliable and timely data; (v) the Bank
should bring more to Albania best practices and international experiences in successful GAC

interventions; (vi) the World Bank, together with other donors, were called upon to promote
donor coordination in GAC agenda to avoid sending mixed signals; and (vii) as much as the
Bank could further bolster its support of government policies, it would also require enhanced
accountability on the part of the government.

In the final sessions of the Joint Learning Event participants agreed that governance matters in
Albania and it is crucial that the World Bank remain engaged on this importance agenda to
support national efforts. The Governance Filter (GF) is important for raising development
effectiveness of the World Bank support program and it was agreed that is has brought more
rigor and focus to the support program to the Country. Going forward, participants affirmed
the importance of upgrading our knowledge base through more analytical work on GAC. It
was also suggested that the World Bank program has to be flexible, innovative and pragmatic
in its entry points to support GAC agenda. The highest priority should be given to building
core government systems to reduce the scope for abuse and corruption. The World Bank
Group should also focus on supporting a smaller and effective government by enhancing
further efforts for liberalization and privatization. Within sectors, sector strategies have to be
prepared with more focus on service delivery improvements (e.g., health sector).

Participants agreed that public administrative reforms are most difficult and recent
developments in this sector calls for a renewed emphasis on de-politicization and relative
autonomy of the civil services. These agenda require broader national consensus and the
Government by itself cannot achieve progress. The World Bank will continue its support
provided that the process of national debate and consensus (particularly among political
parties) is initiated.5 Finally, participants confirmed the importance of establishing baselines
and databases to continuously assess progress and results in the area of GAC.

The Minister of Finance reaffirmed the strong commitment of his government to make
progress in improving governance and reiterated the Government appreciation for the role of
the Bank and the need of his government for more support in this area particularly by bringing
best international practices. The Country Director also affirmed the importance of GAC
agenda for Albania and emphasized the long-term nature of the governance challenges. She
called for perseverance and steady progress. She also called for comprehensive assessment of
incentive structures within sectors to devise lasting solutions for elimination of corruption.
She stressed the importance of reforming the energy and health sectors to realize tangible
progress and to change perceptions. She also underscored the importance of legal and judicial
reforms in Albania.

Honorable Mr. Minister,

In response to Your letter no. 4083, dated 06/06/2007, with subject "Comments
required regarding the project conclusion report on "Reforms in the Public
Administration", concerning the component "Human Resource Management", we
make the following comments:

The "Human Resource Management" component, in this report is assessed as
moderately satisfactory. According to the report, this general assessment was
influenced by:

     Continuation of development of the "Civil Servant Status" law, after 2005.
       One of the arguments used is the fact that after the complaints in the Civil
       Servant Commission, a considerable number of Civil Servants have gained the
       right to return in their former position.

     The passage of subordination of the Public Administration Department from
       the Prime Minister's Office to the Minister of Interior. This has been viewed
       as inappropriate, with effects in the legal influence of the Public
       Administration Department and in the law compliance in general.

     Non-functioning of the National Register of Civil Servants.

With reference to the above mentioned, we will sort our comments according to the
subcomponents:

    1. Implementation of the "Civil Servant Status" law




                                           39

This subcomponent has been assessed as moderately satisfactory. Herewith we clarify
that:
    a) The component has been assessed positively until the end of 2005 (the
        beginning of the project is 1999) and has received a negative assessment after
        this period, because of lay-offs of civil servants, judged as not being in
        conformity with the civil servants legislation;

    b) Has been appraised as positive achievement the creation of a civil service and
        the organization of public competition procedures;

    c) Has been appraised as positive achievement, the functioning of the complaint
        system for the decisions taken from the institutions;

    d) Has been appraised as negative, the fact of giving a political influence to the
        administrations, thus not offering security of stability and continuity.

Based on what was said, we consider that the project has reached overall positive
achievements, reflecting in the approval and implementation of the civil service
legislation, as well as in the increase in the capacity of the public administration and
management of human resources. The creation of a civil service cannot be a basic and
easy process, but it requires effort and strengthening of capacities in the long-term
plan, to make possible the stability of the administration. Despite this, we stress again
that the lay-offs of the civil servants have come as a consequence of the structural
changes of the line ministries and the structuring of the number of ministries.

As a conclusion, we consider that the assessment for this component should be higher
than the one given in the report.


    2. Strengthening of the Public Administration Department

This component as been assessed as unsatisfactory; the argument used is that, because
of the transferring of the Public Administration Department from the Prime Minister's
Office to the Ministry of Interior, the influence of this department has lowered in
bringing reforms forward. Also, the emphasis has been placed in the inadequacy of
the working environment, technical equipments in place, which have influenced the
results of their work.

Concerning this assessment, we clarify that despite some problems with the extension
of the Public Administration Department thought, in the first moments (end of 2005),
afterwards the Albanian Government has put all its effort in the channeling of all the
civil service management procedure through this department. We want to emphasize
here again, that in the report the above mentioned subcomponent has been assessed
positively until the end of 2005.

Despite the above, we want to stress that Public Administration Department, despite
the reform in the Human Resource Management field, proposes, manages and
implements two other very important fields of the reform in the public administration,
such as: the reform in the remuneration field and the reform in the functional and
structural review of the public administration institutions. We want put emphasis on



                                            40

the fact that these two directions of the reform, are being brought forward by the
Public Administration Department, as it was done before.

For all the above mentioned, we judge that despite some problems at the end of 2005,
the components should not be assessed as unsatisfactory, taking into consideration not
only the time span of the project, but also the very good progress of the reforms in the
remuneration field and the one on the functional structural of the institutions, which,
as we emphasized have been directed and managed throughout all the time by the
Public Administration Department.


    3. Assistance to the Training Institute of the Public Administration

This component has been assessed as moderately satisfactory. Concerning this
evaluation, we believe that it should have been higher, as the activity of the ITAP has
been appraised not only in between local institutions, but also from foreign partners.
The foundation of a new institution and achievement of successes of contemporary
level in the forecasting standards and in offering training should have been valued
more in the framework of this project.

Thanking you for the understanding,

Mr. Haldeda,

Concerning the report on the project conclusion on the "Reforms in the Public
Administration" we express that we have no remarks.
According to the component for the Management of Public Expenditure where the
"Budget Formulation" was a subcomponent, as expressed also in this report in
paragraph 1.6 "Reviewed Components" as well as in paragraph 3.2 "Achievements of
Objectives of the Project in Public Expenditure", because this subcomponent was
financed by the DFID, the funds of this subcomponent were reallocated for the
strengthening of the treasury system, another subcomponent of this component.

Thank you,

Subject:        Comments on a project conclusion draft-report on "Reforms in the
                Public Administration"




In response to your request, concerning comments to be given on the project
conclusion draft-report on "Reforms in the Public Administration", we express as
follows:
In its point 1.3, the macro-economical and fiscal analysis started in 1999 until 2005 is
described. The input-output economical forecast model has started to be applied in the
Ministry of Finances in 2000.
The forecasts achieved by the input-output model are only for the revenue with a
"tax" nature, while not including those revenues from "independent budgets" and with
a "non-tax nature". The model has been implemented in 2000 and we are not able to
make a comparison plan  facts for the period 1999-2005. Also we can say that the
planned data during these years have not been saved in separate databases.
As a consequence, based on the input-output model, we are not able to comment on
the level of improvement of revenue forecast, as given in the report (from -6.5% in
1999 to -1.10% in 2005)
