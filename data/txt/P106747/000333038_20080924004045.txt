Tranching      Single tranche of SDR 12.2 million to be releasedupon credit effectiveness.

Description    The proposed DPC is a stand-alone operation that builds on a recently
                ended series of PRSCs. The actions supportedby this credit are included in
                the common Performance Assessment Matrix agreed jointly between the
                government and donor Budget Support Group, and focus on two thematic
               areas: improving public sector management & transparency, and
                strengtheningefficiency andaccountability insocial service delivery.

Benefits        The credit serves to engage the new Nicaraguan authorities in a policy
                dialogue early on, while they are preparing and consulting their up-dated
                PRSP and to maintain continuity in providing needed budget support with
                predictable periodicity.

Risks           Nicaragua exhibits several vulnerabilities that pose a threat to the
                development objectives expected under this operation, including a tense
                internal political environment, which could hold up economic reactivation
                by impairing the investment climate, a fragile macroeconomic framework
                and vulnerability to external shocks, including a slowdown in the U.S.
                economy and further hikes inoil and food prices, and a limitedinstitutional
                capacity, which could paralyze the public investment program, overstretch
                the budget andresult ina deterioration ofpublic services.

                              DEVELOPMENT POLICY CREDIT
                             TO THE REPUBLICOFNICARAGUA


                                        I.INTRODUCTION



1.      This program document proposes a single-tranche, stand-alone Development Policy
Credit (DPC) for the Republic o f Nicaragua. This DPC builds on the recently ended series of
Poverty Reduction Support Credits (PRSCs)'.          It is being proposed for strategic reasons to
engage the authorities in a continuing policy dialogue and in the interests o f maintaining a
predictableperiodicity inbudget support disbursements, while the authorities prepare and consult
their up-dated Poverty Reduction Strategy (PRS).

2.       As indicated in the last PRSP Progress Report,2 the authorities intend to strengthen the
PRSP in response to what has been perceived as a very slow poverty reduction response to the
strategy implemented so far. In particular, the authorities are seeking to deemphasize the
privatization agenda, replace the previous `cluster development strategies' with small and
medium enterprise development models, and promote universal access to basic social services by
lowering their costs. More generally, the revised strategy puts more emphasis than before on
facilitating participation by small and medium producers in the growth process and on
maximizing access to opportunities.

3.      While the strategic emphasis has shifted, the development objectives that are being
pursued by the authorities remain largely the same as before. The authorities have expressed a
strong commitment to the objectives o f poverty reduction that were outlined in the PRSP
prepared by the previous government (denoted the National Development Plan), as well as an
intention to preserve continuity with various key elements o f that strategy, such as maintaining
fiscal and monetary stability, meeting the MDGs and taking advantage o f CAFTA-DR to expand
and diversify exports. The authorities' commitment to maintaining macroeconomic stability is
underlined by the IMF's approval o f a new three-year PRGF arrangement for Nicaragua on
October 4, 2007, for an amount o f SDR 72.5 million. Completion o f the first review under the
PRGF arrangement i s scheduled for mid-September 2008.

4.       IDA'Sresponse to this shift in development strategy has been to explore different
modalities o f service delivery (e.g., private versus public), and focus particular attention on
linking public expenditures and other actions to poverty and social development outcomes.
Many o f the newly proposed activities are still being fleshed out. Therefore, the DPC will focus
on a selective number o f program areas with a proven record o f development impact and where
there i s common ground with the government, while holding off support in other areas until
further information from continuing analytical work becomes available.



1. The proposed DPC is precededby a Programmatic Structural Adjustment Credit (PSAC) approved in March
2003, and two PRSCs, approved in January 2004 and November 2006.The Implementation Completion Report for
the precedingPRSC series was completed inDecember2007; ReportNo. ICR0000684.
2. Report No. 40882-NI, dated September 18,2007.

                                                   1

5.     The preparation of this operation reflects a strong commitment to aid harmonization. In
May 2005, IDA and 8 other donors that make up the Nicaraguan Budget Support Group (BSG)
signed a Joint Financing Arrangement (JFA) with the government. The JFA commits the
signatories to base the policy conditionality of their budget support operations on a common
PerformanceAssessment Matrix (PAM), which is reviewedjointly on an annual basis. The prior
actions for the proposed DPC are based on a subset of actions contained in the most recent
version of the PAM, which was agreed with the government in November 2007. The current
PAM stands out vis-a-vis previous PAMs incontaining amuch smaller number of policy actions;
only 20. While this aspect limits the choice of reform activities that can be supported by this
operation, the selected actions are promising and the harmonized approach has important
advantages for the government inmaking best use of its limitedinstitutional capacities.

6.     The policy actions supported under the proposed DPC focus mainly on public sector
strengthening, with an emphasis on public sector management and transparency, and on
strengthening the efficiency, monitoring and accountability of basic social services. These
actions are drawn mainly from the first two of the four thematic areas covered by the common
PAM, which are (i)macroeconomic stability and improvement of public sector and financial
management, (ii)promotion of greater social and human capital development, (iii)inclusive
economic development, and (iv) strengthened governance and accountability.           These four
thematic areas are broadly consistent with the focus of IDA'Scurrent Country Partnership
Strategy (FY08-FY12), whose lending program is anchored in a series of annual budgetary
support operations.

7.       PresidentDaniel Ortega and the SandinistaParty (FSLN) assumed office inJanuary 2007
after an absence from power of 17 years. President Ortega won the residential with 38 percent
                                                                                        P
of the vote; the next two runner-ups split the Liberal Party vote.                         Even though it emerged
victorious from the elections, the FSLNonly controls 38 seats of the 92-seatNational Congress,
while the two Liberal opposition parties control 45 seats. The new Administration, therefore,
needs to rely on political alliances with members of the opposition in order to pursue its
legislative agenda. This is not an easy task, as political tensions remain high and give rise to
recurrent governance concerns.

A. RecentEconomicDevelopments

8.       After dropping to less than 1 percent in 2002, economic growth recovered to average
around 3.2 percent over 2002-2006; or around 1.3 percent in per capita terms. This growth
performance remains somewhat lackluster in comparison to the growth experienced by its
Central American neighbors and in other lower middle income countries worldwide.
Nicaragua's growth also was markedby strong year-to-year fluctuations that reflect the country's
high vulnerability to external shocks and impedea steady program implementation. Both factors
have contributed to the lack of faster progress inpoverty reduction since 2001.

9.       The most dynamic growth sectors during this period have been the transport &
communications sector, financial intermediation and manufacturing.                                Agriculture, whose
economic reactivation played an important role inpoverty reduction during the secondhalf of the
 1 9 9 0 ~has been exhibiting only modest growth since 2002. From a demand perspective, an
           ~
important source of growth has been the increase in exports, including maquila, which have
doubled since 2002 to reach US$2.3 billion (or 40 percent of GDP) in 2007. An important
stimulus to domestic consumption has been the rapid growth of private remittances, which more
than doubled since 2002 to reachan estimatedUS$740 million in2007 (or 13 percent of GDP).
Imports also increased significantly during that period, driven inpart by rising oil prices. Even
so, the Balance of Payments Current Account improved modestly since 2001-02, permitting a
significant accumulation of gross international reservesto over 3 months of imports.

 10.     The Bolafios Administration applied prudent fiscal policies, which succeeded in
progressively reducing the overall public sector balance after grants, from a deficit of 5.4 percent
o f GDP in 2002 to a surplus of 0.7 percent in 2007. This fiscal improvement was mainly
achieved through fiscal revenue growth (in response to several tax and administrative reforms),
some improvement in the operating balances of public enterprises, a significant decline in the
operating losses of the Central Bank, and the decline in interest obligations as a result of several
debt relief initiatives (especially after Nicaragua reached the completion point under the HIPC
Initiativeinearly 2004).

least 35 percent o fthe vote and a five-point lead over his nearest rival for a first-round victory.

11.       Nicaragua's overall positive economic performance since 2002 was supported by a
PRGF-arrangement approved by the IMF in December 2002 and a series of budget-support
operations from the World Bank (PSAC, PRSC-I and PRSC-11) and other donors. Although
progress under these arrangements occasionally stalled, the authorities eventually succeeded in
bringing the program back on track again. Accordingly, the World Bank disbursed the second
tranche of PRSC-I in March 2006 and approved a one-tranche PRSC-I1 in November 2006,
while the IMF successfully concluded its eleventh (and final) program review under the PRGF
arrangementinDecember2006.

12.       Macroeconomic management has remained broadly favorable during the first year of the
Ortega Administration, which succeededinnegotiating a new PRGF program that was approved
by the IMF Board in October 2007. The authorities have kept a tight rein on public finances,
with the result that the primary and the overall fiscal balance outcomes for 2007 turned out to be
much better thanprojected, though partly on account of an under-execution of public investment
projects. All quantitative performance criteria established in the PRGF arrangement through
end-2007 were met with ample margins, and all planned structural reforms have been
implemented, though with some delays. Economic growth, on the other hand, has remained
elusive. It only reached 3.8 percent in 2007, or slightly below the program projections (4.2
percent), while the inflationrate (Dec-to-Dec) turned out to be considerably higher thanprogram

                                                                  4

projections (17 percent versus 7.3 percent).                 This outcome is mainly attributable to several
external shocks, which included a category 5 Hurricane (Felix) in early September 2007,
followed by an unusually wet rainy season and rapidly rising international prices o f basic grains
and fuels, rather thanto a weakening policy stance.

13.      Economic performance has weakened during the first six months o f 2008 mainly due to
the deteriorating external environment. Key factors contributing to this deterioration are the
economic slowdown in the global economy and particularly in the United States, and rising
international energy and food prices.                While rising global fuel and food prices are largely
responsible for keeping inflation indouble digit levels:               shortages inducedby a national transport
strike and wage pressures also have contributed to the rising price momentum. Wages have
increased inline with the overall inflation rate, but the size o f the public wage bill is projected to
decline as a percentage of GDP in 2008. Macroeconomic policies have continued to be sound
amidst the deteriorating external conditions, with the result that most o f the quantitative
performance criteria under the PRGF program through June 2008 also were met, except for a
slight shortfall inthe accumulation o fNet International Reserves.'

14.      Inspite of a positive macro policy performance, completion of the first PRGFprogram
review was delayed by threats to the stability o f the financial system that were triggered by a
court decision inApril 2008 that suspended the debt service on central bank bonds (CENIS) held
by the two largest banks, pendingthe outcome o f a legal investigations6These CENIS represent a
substantial portion o f the affected banks' total assets, so the debt service suspension brought into
question their ability to meet minimumreserve requirements. Since then, several developments
have reduced the threat o f financial instability: in July 2008, the two banks agreed with the
central bank on a further restructuring o f the outstanding bonds (extending their maturity to 20
years and reducing their interest rate to around 5 percent), while the Attorney General agreed to
withdraw the earlier legal challenges and the Superintendence o f Banks has agreed to exercise
temporary regulatory forbearance and phase-in the application o f more stringent accounting
norms that came into effect in January 2008, to avoid an immediate impairment o f the banks'
capital position. While these steps have eliminated an immediate threat to financial stability, a
more durable solution is needed to safeguard the financial system, involving ratification o f the
central bank's board o f directors o f the restructuring deal negotiated with the two banks and the
definition o f a time-bound program by the Superintendence o f Banks to limit regulatory
forbearance. Inthis regard, the authorities have sent to the National Assembly nominations for


4.  In2007, Nicaragua's inflation rate shot upmuch more inresponseto external food and fuel price shocks than in
the other countries in the region. Three factors have contributed to this phenomenon: an unusually large weight
attached to food prices in Nicaragua's Consumer Price Index, the maintenance o f market-based fuel prices (which
results in a full pass-through o f international fuel price increases onto domestic fuel prices), and the coincidence o f
adverse weather conditions duringNicaragua's main harvest season (September-October) with rising international
food prices.
5.  This shortfall, which amounts to US$14 million below the programmed accumulation, is very small in
comparison to the over-compliance o f US$148 millionwith the end-2007 target.
6. The CENIs in question were issued during the 2000-01 banking crisis to cover the difference between
performing assets and liabilities o f insolvent banks that were intervened at the time and absorbed by two private
banks. These CENIS, which originally had a maturity o f up to 3 years, were indexed to the US Dollar and yielded
an interest rate o f 14.5 percent, were restructured in 2003 with a maturity o f 10 years and an interest rate o f 8.25
percent. The court decision inApril 2008 suspendingdebt service on these CENIS questioned the transparency o f
the bankresolution process, the amounts ofthe CENIS issued, andthe bondrestructuring in2003.

the vacant positions of the central bank board7and the Superintendence of Banks has agreed to
present a calendar for phasing out regulatory forbearance. These developments are being
monitored by the IMF inthe context of the PRGF arrangement.

B. MacroeconomicOutlookandDebt Sustainability

15.     Economic growth is expected to end up between 3.0 and 4.0 percent in 2008, reflecting
the adverse external developments described earlier (para. 13), and projected to converge
thereafter to a long term rate of 5 percent, buoyed by continuing export growth and a favorable
investment environment supported by CAFTA, as well as stabilizing commodity prices.
Inflation is expected to remain high at around 15 percent in 2008, before coming back down to
single digits thereafter, consistent with the application of prudent fiscal and monetary policies
supported under the PRGF arrangement. The program supported by this arrangement builds on
the earlier progress made inreestablishing macroeconomic stability, while generating additional
fiscal space to raise poverty reduction spending without compromising debt sustainability and
boosting growth through measures to improve economic returns on public investments and raise
investor confidence. As discussed inthe 2007 PER, the generally positive mediumterm outlook
also is conditioned on the authorities' capacity to successfully address several important fiscal
challenges that include (i)         the fiscal imbalances created by the growing central government
revenue transfers to the municipalities mandatedby Law 466, (ii)              avoiding a wage-prices spiral
from developing in response to the spiking inflation in 2007 and 2008 ,(iii)                growing resistance
to price adjustments inkey sectors affected by rising oil and food prices (iv) a growing actuarial
deficit of the pension system that will eventually trigger its collapse in the absence of reforms,
and (v) the budgetary impact of seekingto universalize public servicesby loweringtheir costs.

16.     A joint IDA-IMF Debt Sustainability Analysis (DSA) was completed in August 2007
(see 2007 CPS). The analysis indicated that the risk of Nicaragua experiencing debt distress i s
moderate, but manageable, provided that sound macroeconomic policies are applied.
Nicaragua's external debt innet present value (NPV) terms declined from 40 percent of GDP in
2005 to about 28 percent of GDP at the end of 2007, on the basis of full delivery of all scheduled
HIPC, post-HIPC and MDRI debt relief.'               On the internal front, Nicaragua's public domestic
debt, which amounted to almost 20 percent of GDP (inNPV terms) at the end of 2007, has also
been declining rapidly and is programmed to fall below 10 percent of GDP by 2010. In
summary, even though the overall public debt of approximately 48 percent of GDP (in NPV
terms) i s still high, leaving Nicaragua vulnerable to internal and external shocks in the short
term, the overall debt ratio has been declining rapidly. Moreover, the results of the joint DSA
conclude that the fiscal stance of the program presented by the Nicaraguan authorities should
result infurther declines inthe public debt ratio over the medium term. A DSA update prepared
in mid-2008 by the IMF to include information on private debt and ALBA-related financing
concludes that Nicaragua still has a moderate, but manageable, risk of external public debt

7. Three central bank board members resigned in May to protest the handling o f this issue, breaking the quorum
neededfor board decisions. This impedescentral bank ratificationof the bond restructuring agreement and hampers
monetary policy management. Since the central bank board is elected by the members o f the National Assembly, a
cross-partisan agreement is needed to overcome this institutional roadblock.
8.  There have been some delays inthe delivery of debt relief, so that the nominal value o f the external debt only
declined from 85.5 percent o f GDP in 2006 to 59 percent in 2007, instead o f the projected 36 percent. The
remaining decline i s projected to take place in2008.

distress. In any case, the authorities will be facing a very difficult policy environment in the
short to mediumterm, which is marked by the global economic slowdown (especially inthe U.S.
economy), rising oil and fuel prices, continued domestic political tensions, and approaching
municipaland regional elections. (The associated risksare discussedinparagraphs 90-93.)

C. PRSPImplementation

17.       Nicaragua is one of the poorest countries in Latin America, with a per capita gross
national income of US$ 990 in 2007 (Atlas method) and a total population of 5.2 million.
According to the 2001 Living Standards Measurement Survey (LSMS), 46 percent of the
population lived below the national poverty line, while 15 percent lived in extreme poverty.
These figures reflect a significant decline inextreme poverty since 1993,and a modest decline in
terms of overall poverty rates. Since 2001, however, the process of poverty reduction appears to
have stagnated, as the data from the 2005 LSMS indicate no significant change in either the
overall and extreme poverty rates.' This negative outcome is likely to be related to Nicaragua's
lackluster growth performance since 2001,particularlyinagriculture (on which many of the poor
rely). On a more positive note, the 2005 LSMS results also show that the average depth of
poverty (distance from the poverty line) has continued to decline, and that the degree of
inequality, as measured by the Gini index on consumption, has fallen. Poverty remains heavily
concentratedin rural areas and associated with agricultural sector activities, which still account
for 17percent of GDP; a relatively large share by regional standards.

Note: This Table's assessment of whether progress in meeting PRSP goals is on track or not is based on the rate of
progress made up until2005 in relation to the intermediate 2005 target and under consideration of the end (2015)
target. It does not take into account subsequent policy efforts that may have been taken to accelerate progress
toward meetingthe MDGs.

18.        The progress made in recent years toward achieving the other PRS goals also has been
mixed and raises concerns about future poverty reduction prospects. Less than two-thirds of the
goals were met in 2005-06, and half of the MDGtargets are off-track (see Table 2). Moreover,

from 45.8 percent in2001 to 46.1 percent in2005, while the extreme poverty rate fell slightly from 15.1 percent to
14.9percent.

has been uneven, as (i)educational efficiency remains low, with high rates of primary school
repetition and low completion, (ii)   the failures to advance on the health MDGs for maternal and
infant mortality are linked to slow progress in peri-natal care, and (iii) coverage of basic
                                                                               the
water and sanitation services, which is critical for reducing child malnutrition, remains deficient.
The authorities have expressed concern about the slow progress in achieving the PRS goals in
their PRSP-I1First Annual Progress Report presented in July 2007 and have already begun to
modify public interventions in the education, health, water and sanitation sectors in an urgent
effort to strengthenPRS implementation.

D. MainDevelopmentChallenges

19.      To improve PRSP implementation and achieve the MillenniumDevelopment Goals, the
rate of progress inNicaragua needs to be steppedup significantly. As summarized in the 2007
Country Partnership Strategy, this will require overcoming the following development
challenges:
        Maintaining macroeconomic stability, which will require keeping public spending under
        control, resisting growing pressures on public sector wages, pairing the increase in fiscal
        transfers to the municipalities with proportional transfers of spending responsibilities, and
        correcting the actuarial deficits of the pension system. This i s especially challenging inthe
        context of the government's policy of seekingto universalize access to public services.
    0   Pursuing; public sector efficiency by improving the professionalism of the civil service,
        expanding the use of financial management systems, providing greater freedom of
        information to allow citizens to hold government more accountable and strengthening the
        quality and targeting ofpublic spending.
    0   Building a competitive investment climate by overcoming key infrastructure and
        regulatory bottlenecks to allow taking better advantage of global markets. The limitations
        inelectricity supply androad network are critical bottlenecks inthis regard, together with
        high levels of bureaucratic redtape and insecure property rights. Boosting the productivity
        of the rural poor to help them compete globally presents a special challenge that will
        require expanding their access to productive infrastructure (water, roads, rural telephony
        and rural electrification), improving the system of agricultural extension services, and
        providingmore secure landrights.
    0   Maximizing human potential through access to quality education and adequate nutrition
        and health services. Though primary enrollment has increased significantly in the last
        decade, high drop-out and repetition rates remain problematic, and access to pre-school
        and secondary education is severely limited. Curriculums need to be revised for greater
        relevance and investment in vocational and secondary education needs to increase. In
        health, the big challenge is to continue expanding the coverage and quality o f primary
        health services in affordable ways. Chronic malnutrition remains alarmingly high and
        requires immediate attention through multi-sectoral interventions. Also, special efforts
        are required to provide social services to the isolated and traditionally marginalized
        populations on the Atlantic coast.
    0   Improving governance is a cross-cutting ingredient critical for all aspects of the
        developmentprocess, and requires strengtheningthe regulatory systemfor public services,
        more secure property registration and titling systems, and greater public accountability,
        includingthrough a stronger Comptroller General's office and social accounting systems.

                              111.     THE GOVERNMENT'SPROGRAM


A. The PRSPUpdate

20.     The poverty reduction strategy prepared by the Bolaiios Administration, titled "Plan
Nacional de Desarrollo 2005-2009", representedan update of the earlier "Estrategia Reforzada
de Crecimiento Econdmico y Reduccidn de la Pobreza" that was completed in 2001.
Responding to the slowdown inpoverty reduction, the Ortega Administration i s inthe process of
updating the strategy further for the period 2008-2011,under the name of "Plan Nacional de
Desarrollo Humano", PNDH. The PRSP update is scheduled to be completed in September
2008.'0

21.     The PNDH is expected to buildon the longer term poverty reduction strategy presented
in earlier strategies, placing greater emphasis on social development and inclusive growth. In
this regard, the authorities have indicated a commitment to maintain continuity with certain key
elements of the earlier strategies that have been considered successful.                    These include (i)
maintaining macroeconomic stability and ensuring public debt sustainability as prerequisites for
reducing poverty, (ii)advancing on key social goals towards meeting the MDGs, (iii)
diversifying the export base and leveraging regional free trade agreements, including CAFTA-
DRYin order to increase access to external markets," and (iv) preserving a policy environment
conducive to attracting more private investment, includingfrom foreign sources.

22.     The authorities also have indicated a commitment to change certain elements of the
existing poverty reduction strategy. Important changes to be emphasized in the PRSP update
are: (i)switching from the current project-loan approachto sector-loan approach inthe context of
sector-wide approaches, (ii)        refocusing from the "cluster strategy" promoted in the previous
PRSP, that was viewed as favoring larger more establishedeconomic agents, towards supporting
production by the poorest households and small & medium sized enterprises (SMEs), including
by providing increased access to credit for these sectors, (iii)discontinuing the privatization
agenda, which i s viewed as not having worked well, especially inthe electricity sector and social
security, (iv) refocusing international development assistance to be more in line with the
objectives o f the updated PRS, and (v) improving access to public services in health and
education, inpart by providing these services free of charge to beneficiaries and incoordination
with other line ministries. An overall objective guidingthe authorities inupdatingthe PRSP is to
increase ownership of the strategy, particularly in the articulation and implementation o f key
structural reforms.




10. Dissemination of PRS-relatedinformation as well as other developmentpolicy relevant materials is posted on
the Technical Secretariat to the Presidency'swebsite: httv://www.setec.aob.ni/publicaciones.shtml
11. The trade policy agenda includes: promoting CAFTA implementation; advancing on trade negotiations with
the Bolivarian Alternative for Latin America and the Caribbean (ALBA), the European Union and the Caribbean
community (CARICOM); and continuing negotiationsfor the CentralAmerican Customs Union.

                                                         9

B. Key Policy Areas

23.     The priorities of the Ortega Administration for the short and medium term are
summarized in the Government's Economic and Financial Program 2007-2009 (EFP), which
complements the longer term poverty reduction strategy that is currently under preparation. The
EFP views wealth creation and poverty reduction as inseparable elements of the country's
economic and social development. It hopes to achieve this dual objective by emphasizing the
following four lines of action:
       Reactivating the economy, stimulating productivity and enhancing competitiveness to
       combat poverty and malnutrition through continued macroeconomic stability (supported
       by a Fund program), a strengthened fiscal policy (tax reform, disciplined public
        spending), pursuit of free trade alliances (CAFTA and others), creating a healthy
       investment climate, improved property rights, the promotion of small and medium
       enterprises, and special attention to agro-industry and tourism sectors.
        Improving social equity and opportunity through access to free health and education
        services, career-long training of the work-force, recapitalization of rural poor households
        (`Bono Productivo '), social protection (with special attention to children aged 0 to 6 and
        school feeding programs), Social Security reform andhousing programs.
       Increasing the coverage and quality o f infrastructure (energy, water & sanitation,
       transport) and promoting a more sustainable development process through better
       biodiversity, watershed andnatural resourcemanagement.
        Improving governance and accountability through decentralization, greater citizen and
        civil society participation, better public financial management, strengthened control
        mechanisms (audit institutions) and more transparency in public operations (enhanced
       access to public information).

24.     O f the various policy and reform initiatives being developed by the Ortega
Administration, this DPC proposes to focus on two broad lines of actions that deal with (i)
improving public sector management and transparency, and (ii)strengthening the basis for
ensuring greater efficiency and accountability inthe delivery of social services. The first line of
actions includes measures to professionalize the civil service, modernize public financial
management and promote greater transparency in public management though better access to
public information. The second line o f actions includes measures in the areas of education,
health, nutritionand water & sanitation services. Each is discussed below.

B.1 ImprovingPublicSector Management and Transparency

Civil Service Professionalization

25.     Key Issues. Politicization and a high turn-over of public sector employees have been
long-standing problems in Nicaragua's public sector. Civil Service Law No. 476, approved in
November 2003, sought to address these problems by providing the normative framework for a
progressive merit-based professionalization of the civil service. Although work advanced<in
implementing this new framework, progress had been slow, mainly due to problems of
implementation and budget constraints. That is, the Civil Service Office had been conducting
the accreditation processes using a centralized approach supported by a small group of


                                                 10

consultants that were responsible for carrying out a set o f complex activities in different
agencies, which proved to be overwhelming. Similarly, the lack of sufficient fiscal resources
prevented the generalized application of an integrated salary policy. Although the government
succeeded in designing a new Reference Salary Table (RST) for the civil service, a
comprehensive adjustment of salaries to the levels recommended in the RST would have raised
the overall public wage bill beyond existing fiscal constraints.

26.     Important issues that need to be addressed in the area of civil service reform are (i)  the
dissemination of the civil service law, which is still unfamiliar to many staff inhigher positions
and new personnel, (ii) needto decentralize the functions and responsibilities concentrated in
                          a
the Directorate of Public Function (DPF) to the human resource offices of line agencies in the
interests of introducing greater flexibility to speed up the accreditation process, (iii)
                                                                                        completing
the preparation of civil service manuals to help implement the new classification, promotion,
performance, remuneration andtraining systems, with the involvement of all the humanresource
offices in line agencies, (iv) the strengthening of the Civil Service Appeals Committee (CSAC),
inorder to limit the amount of discretion inthe hiring andfiring ofpersonnel, (v) the training of
civil servants to improve public administration, and (vi) the legal vacuum produced on account
of a lack of clarity with respect to the implications of the Labor Code for the Civil Service Law.

27.      Government Actions.       With the overall objective of institutionalizing public sector
employment and restoring full control over human resource management, the Government's
strategy contemplates the following actions: (i)continuing the accreditation process under the
Civil Service Law in accordance with the Government's Strategic Plan for the Civil Service, (ii)
strengthening the civil service institutional regulatory and oversight functions to be exercised by
the CSAC, (iii)   implementing a gradual absorption of consultants into the civil service, and (iv)
strengthening the Government's human resource administration in the context of a stable
macroeconomic framework.

28.      Inregardto the civil servants accreditation process, the Government succeeded inraising
the total number of accredited civil servants from an estimated 5,800 at the end of 2006 to over
7,600 in March 2008, and expects to raise this total to around 10,000 by the end of 2008,
representing about 9 percent of all central government staff.         Looking further ahead, the
Government i s planning to have accredited about 18,000 civil servants by 2010, representing
around 17 percent o f total central government employees. (This represents around 83 percent of
all public employees that are eligible to be accredited under the Civil Service Law.) To achieve
this acceleration in the accreditation process, the government intends to further decentralize
human resource management procedures by strengthening and empowering human resource
management units at the institutions level. The Bank is supporting this effort as part o f the TA
activities to be implemented under the PSTAC.

29.      The advance inimplementing the Civil Service Law No. 476 through the accreditation of
an estimated7,517civil servants by the end of 2007 is aprior action for this DPC.

30.      Expected Results. The preceding human resource and civil service management
initiatives are expected to modernize human resource management systems in the country. By
2010, Nicaragua should be able to count on a more stable and professional cadre of civil


                                                   11

servants, as the government will have (i) completed the accreditation of at least 18 percent of all
central government employees (or around 83 percent of those eligible to be accredited under the
Civil Service Law) and (ii)  strengthenedthe humanresource management administration of the
public sector in the context of a stable macroeconomic framework. Although the accreditation
process covers a relatively small portion of total public sector employment, it is expectedto have
a major impact on public sector efficiency. This i s because it covers most administrative staff in
the central government, especially the mid-leveltechnical staff administering projects andpublic
investment activities. These are the employees that traditionally have beenaffected by high tum-
over rates associated with changes in political regimes, contributing to disruptions in program
execution and low public sector productivity. As these employees are accredited under the new
civil service regime, the amount of turnover should decline significantly, permitting greater
continuity in public sector operations and an improved matching of staff skills and job
competencies.

Public Financial Management and Information Systems

3 1.    Key Issues in Public Financial Management. Nicaragua's public financial management
(PFM) has improved significantly in recent years. The Financial Management and Budget
Regime Law No. 550 of August 2005 represents a high point inthis process. The law improved
the controls over financial resources, implemented a single treasury account, strengthenedthe
budget system, and implemented the Medium Term Expenditure Framework (MTEF). In
addition, the Government improved its debt management through a new and comprehensive
legal framework (Law No. 477), andthe development of new systems for debt management. The
Government also has advanced in implementing the Public Procurement Law No. 323 of 2003.
However, the application of Law 323 has brought to light some significant weaknesses in the
legal framework that governs the control over public procurement, especially with regard to
authorizations for direct procurement basedon emergency and national security reasons.

32.     Another area of public financial management that exhibits weaknesses are the internal
and external audit controls mechanisms. The country only has had one audit based on
international standards performed on its government budget (for the 2005 executed budget).
Even then, the audit report was not delivered on time and has not been sent to the National
Assembly, leaving gaps in the accountability process. Moreover, since there are no significant
sanctions or penalties associated with the findings publishedby the General Comptrollers Office
(CGR), its control capacities are very limited.

33.     While the implementation of the public sector's integrated financial information system
(SIGFA) has advanced significantly, there remains much scope for improving coverage and
completing the integration of its budget, accounting, treasury and debt systems. Inaddition, it is
important to consider the adoption of the budget classification according the Manual of the
International Monetary Fund (IMF) of 2001. Since adoption of this new budget classification
would imply a new system design, it is necessary to evaluate its financial cost and technological
implications.

34.     Government Actions. The Government is committed to the modernization of PFM, as
reflected in the recent achievements in strengthening the budgeting, treasury, accounting and


                                                 12

public credit systems inthe public sector. These achievements include (i) the number o f
                                                                               raising
public entities that are using a medium term expenditure framework (MTEF) from 18 inthe 2007
government budget to 25 in the 2008 government budget, (ii)        the initiation o f wire transfers to
effect payment to municipal governments, and (iii)the launching o f an improved debt
management system (SIGADE-Integrado) that integrates into one data-base the public debts
administered by the finance ministry and central bank, which heretofore were recorded
separately. This set o f achievements i s a prior action for this DPC.

35.     The authorities are also inthe process o f designing a medium-term PFM modernization
plan. The plan will seek to (i)    develop and expand the institutional coverage o f SIGFA, (ii)
strengthen the system o f financial statistics in the public sector, (iii)modernize the finance
ministry, including the tax and customs administrations, and (iv) revise the budget classification
according to the IMF Manual o f 2001,following a review and impact evaluation, to allow for the
implementation o f a results-oriented budgeting and accounting process, and facilitate the
expansion o f MTEFs to all sectors.

36.     The Government i s developing a public assets inventory system (Sisterna de Bienes del
Estado, SIBE) to improve the quality o f financial statements through the effective
implementation o f the norm on public assets usingthe SIGFA system. It is also preparing a debt
strategy, with technical assistance support from IDA, inline with the new legal framework given
by Law No. 477. This will clarify responsibilities, limits and procedures for contracting new
public debt and permit a more prudential debt management. In addition, the government i s
proceeding to integrate the debt information system (SIGADE) with SIGFA to improve controls
and the quality o f the data, while seeking to improve the structure o f the internal debt through
renegotiations inan effort to enhance debt sustainability.

37.     Concerning procurement issues, the government will continue the implementation o f the
procurement information system supported by the Inter-American Development Bank (IDB). In
addition, the government is implementing the development o f the interfaces between SIGFA and
the procurement system. As a first step, the e-based procurement system web site
(www.nicaraauacompra.nob.ni) will disseminate the key procedures and stages o f the
procurement process such as the initiation o f the process, the results o f the evaluation, and the
selected contractor.

38.     Finally, the MHCP and the CGR are seeking to institutionalize the annual audit o f the
executed budget inaccordance with Law 550. Inthis context, accountability mechanisms will be
strengthened through the subsequent follow-up o f audit report recommendations by the CGR and
the internal control units, andby the submission o fthe audit reports to the National Assembly.

39.     Expected Results. By end-2008, at least 20 central government agencies are expected to
be operating with the SIGFA cash module, while 6 administrative units in MINSA should be
operating with the main SIGFA module. Also, in all areas where the financial system i s
sufficiently developed, central government employees should be receiving their payments
through electronic transfers, providing a more secure payments environment. The development
o f the SIGFA-SIGADE interface and o f the SIGFA-SNIP interface should be completed, with
both interfaces operating satisfactorily.     Finally, the physical inventories o f moiable assets


                                                  13

should have been incorporated into the public assets inventory system (SIBE) for three pilot
institutions inthe central government. Over the mediumterm, the SIGFA and SIGADE modules
will also be completely integrated with the e-procurement system, andthe financial reports of the
non-financial public system will be presented with the revised budget classification system,
using SIGFA's new web-based platform, to be developed. Furthermore, 49 public entities are
expected to be implementing a MTEF by 2010, or almost double the number in 2008. In this
regard, the government will implement also a system to follow-up in physical terms the goals
and indicators includedinthe MTEFs for all central government entities. The integration of the
budgeting, treasury, accounting and debt management systems i s particularly important because
it permits the emergence of synergiesthat are not available fromjust modernizing these systems
individually.

40.      Key Issues regardingAccess to Public Information. Government and civil society have
advanced on the transparency fkont with the development of newmechanismsto promote greater
social accountability. Inparticular, NGOs have developed pilot projects to measure the quality
of basic services (health, education and use of municipal transfers) at the municipal level, while
several line ministries, including M T I and FISE have developed programs to increase citizen
participation inthe monitoring and evaluation of the services they provide. Nevertheless, the lack
of adequate access to public information has been identified as one of the major obstacles to
more effective participation and social accountability. Access to public information and key
development indicators i s neededfor increased transparency and accountability in management
ofpublic funds and improvements inthe delivery of basic services

41.      Government Actions. Efforts to achieve a consensus on a Law to grant Freedom o f
Access to Public Information had been underway for several years, with IDA assistance,
including support for an established group of civil society organizations that took an active role
inthe designofthe law. Its passage was expectedunder PRSC I,but more time was neededto
obtain consensus on its content. IDA continued to support consensusbuilding and the Law was
passed in May of 2007 and became effective on December 22, 2007. The "Grupo Promotor"
also worked closely with the government to draw up the Law's implementing regulations (No.
81-2007), which were published in the Official Gazette on January 9, 2008. To promote the
implementation of the law, the Presidency also issued Decree No. 117-2007 (published in the
Official Gazette on January 10, 2008), instructing all public sector entities to establish pubic
information offices inaccordancewith the law.

42.      ExpectedResults. Followingthe publication of the Law's implementing statutes, gradual
implementation of the law will initiate with the establishment of five Public InformationOffices
in five line ministries during 2008. The government also is planning to further open public
information offices in other public entities at a rate of 5 new offices per year. Civil society
organizations are continuing their efforts to disseminate the law at the national and municipal
levels and Bank trust funds will be used to support compliance by the regional autonomous
governments on the Caribbean Coast.

43.      Key Issues regardingthe Oualitv of Public Information. Although significant resources
havebeendedicatedto PRS expenditures, it is recognized by the authorities and donors alike that
their effectiveness needs to be enhanced. Poverty expenditures currently comprise about one-


                                                14

half of the entire budget envelope, representing more than 13 percent of GDP. Their impact in
terms of poverty reduction and on the intermediate indicators, however, has been disappointing.
A first step towardimprovingthe impact of anti-poverty spendingis the existence of information
systems that permit a closer monitoring of PRS implementation on a more regular basis. In
addition, as an increasing proportion o f fiscal resources is transferred directly to the
municipalities, achieving the PRS objectives will also depend increasingly on spending at the
local level. Thus, it will also be important to have a better understanding o f municipal
expenditures, and be able to identify existing overlaps of responsibilities at the central and
municipal levels. The 2006 budget allocated about US$60 million (or about 6 percent of total
central government income) for municipal transfers, while the 2007 budget allocated around 7
percent of total central government income for suchtransfers. Inorder to contribute to the impact
of PRS spending, these transfers need to respond to PRS objectives while supporting locally
identifiedpriorities.

44.      PRS indicators, includingpoverty trends and the MillenniumDevelopment Goals (MDs),
have beenmeasured and monitored every four or five years through the use o f Living Standards
Measurement Surveys (LSMS) and Demographic & Health Surveys (DHS), as well as other
survey data collection instruments. The authorities and donors have recognized the need to
monitor these PRS indicators on amore frequent, andpreferably annual, basis.

45.      Government Actions. The Government is in the process of updating its PRS and has
committed to continue producing annual reports on progress in implementing the PRS. The
authorities have also committed to preparing annual analyses o f public expenditures, especially
those related to the execution of poverty reduction spending, and include this information inthe
PRS Update and Annual Progress Reports. These documents are expected to include data on
progressinreaching the PRS/MDG/PRSC targets.l2

46.      The Government also plansto design and implement a poverty spending monitoring and
evaluation system that incorporates quality issues, such as incidence, coverage, efficiency and
effectiveness indicators. Plans also include identifying a methodology to measure the poverty
indicator annually andalso monitor PRS socio-economic indicators on an annualbasis.13

47.      Expected Results. Implementing these plans will allow for improvements in impact and
follow-up of PRS spending. They can potentially enhance the allocation, quality and targeting of
PRS spending. In order to do so, it would be important that expected results incorporate

 12. Improvements in the impact and follow-up of PRS spending (incidence, coverage, efficiency and
effectiveness) should aid in improvingthe decision-makingprocess for (i)    identifyingpriorities inthe extensionof
basic service provisionto under-servedpopulations, (ii)suggesting neededreforms to social sectors, (iii)    selecting
areas for improvements inpublic humanresourcemanagement, (iv) enhancingpublic expenditure management and
project appraisal, (v) suggesting preferred investments in social and infiastructure services, (vi) recommend
modificationsto policiesandprogramsaimedat supportingjob creation, accessto productiveassets by the poor, and
support to medium- and small-scale investment, and (vii) identify areas for improved coordination and
rationalizationofprogramsanddonor support.
 13. Regardingthe measurement and monitoringof poverty and PRS socio-economic indicators, it will be crucial
for the new methodology to continue providingthe basis for consistent estimation and analysis of poverty trends.
Attention should be given to comparability issues in measuringand monitoring the evolution of poverty and PRS
socio-economic indicators over time. For this purpose, it will be importantto consider international best practices in
poverty measurement andmonitoringofMDGs.

municipal expenditures to improve PRS local implementation capacity while strengthening
reporting, transparency and social auditing. These plans would enable donors to better monitor
the execution o f public expenditures, and would also contribute to determining whether
analytical work i s influencingpublic policy.

B.2 Strengthening Efficiency andAccountability in Social Service Delivery

48.     The efficiency o f public service delivery in the social sectors and in water & sanitation
has beenhighlighted as a key element o f the new administration's agenda. This calls for a series
of efforts to strengthen monitoring systems and accountability mechanisms, promote clear
standards for the delivery o f services, and improve the quality of services through improved
management o f human resources, improved curriculum and staff qualification (education) and
protocols (health and nutrition). The DPC supports efforts in these critical areas in education,
health, nutrition and water.

Education

49.     Key Issues. The education system has made important strides in expanding coverage
with primary enrollment rates reaching 86 percent in 200614. However challenges remain with
respect to access, equity, efficiency and quality at all levels, as well the central challenge o f
strengthening institutional capacity and efficiency inthe sector. While net enrollment rates have
increased inall levels between2000 and 2006, they remain low for pre-school(52.1 percent) and
secondary education (43.6 percent). Repetition rates have also remained high and virtually
unchanged since 2001, and the proportion o f students that complete primary education in the
allotted time remains low, at 41 percent in2006. Education quality is low by regional standards,
and has not improved since 2002. Nicaragua's gross primary and preschool enrollment rates are
low compared to other countries with similar levels o f development, and primary school
completion rates and average school attainment are among the lowest in the region (with
Guatemala and Haiti). With respect to education quality, Nicaragua has the highest pupil-teacher
ratio inLatin American inbothprimary and secondary schools, and its teacher work force i s also
one o f the least qualified in the region15, with 26.3 percent and 51.7 percent o f teachers
unqualified in primary and secondary education respectively. The twin challenges o f ensuring
continued expansions in access, especially in rural areas, and continued improvements in the
quality o f teaching and learning continue to be the cornerstones o f the education agenda at all
levels. These call for stronger accountability mechanisms to monitor progress and performance
andto improve the allocation o fresources.

50.     Government Actions. The key objective in education o f the current administration i s to
provide universal public primary education and reduce illiteracy. The authorities believe that
certain elements o f the school autonomy program introduced under earlier Administrations, and
backed by the Education Law 413 (Art. 16), were not conducive to the attainment o f this
objective. Accordingly, an early action taken by the government was to terminate the financial

transfers to schools while a proposal for an improved mechanism is being designed. The
Government i s currently developing its new strategy, which is to include the following actions:

    Establishing learning objectives, measuring outcomes and promoting standards. This
    includesthe dissemination of the results ofthe 2006 student learning achievementtests to the
    national education commissions and on the web portal of the Ministry of Education, the
    promotion of standards and social accountability, and the preparation and implementation of
    a national strategy for student learning achievement to support continuity of national and
    international efforts to monitor the quality of education. This is a key element for improving
    the allocation of resources, targeting capacity strengthening efforts and for generatinggreater
    accountability.

    Improving the quality of primary and secondary education through improved teacher
    training. This includes the development of the "Plan Nacional de Forrnacibn de Maestros" to
    reduce the prevalence o f unqualified teachers in primary and secondary schools and its
    implementation.

    Developing and implementing a new curriculum based on new didactic and pedagogical
    practices, to respondto the analysis of the 2006 studentlearning achievementtests.

    Implementing in a successful manner the strategy to ensure primary schools in rural areas
    offer the full cycle of primary education, through the expansions of schools offering the
    multi-grade modality, if needed, an increase in the number o f classrooms and teachers in
    targeted areas.

51.     The Government's publication of the results of the 2006 student learning achievement
tests, together with its preparation of a plan to disseminate these results to all teachers, school
directors and civil society during 2008. is aprior action for this DPC.

52.     Expected Results. By the end of 2008, it is expected that the results of the 2006 student
learning achievement tests will be disseminated largely in all the educational centers, with the
participation of the education community and civil society, and that didactic guides for teaching
of SpanishandMathematics will be distributedwith a view to improve the pedagogical practices
of primary school teachers. This represents a very important initial action for introducing greater
awareness about education standards and accountability, as a necessary step toward improving
efficiency and quality in education. Other results expected from the broader set of actions
contemplated by the government in this sector include (i)                 a reduction of the share of non-
qualified teachers16 in primary and secondary schools, (ii)               improvements in student learning
outcomes, and (iii)    an increase in the share of students completing primary education on time
(especially inrural areas).

Health

53.     Kev Issues. The MDG infant and child mortality goals are within reach, reflecting
important advances in access to basic health services over the past decade. However, maternal
mortality remains high and pre-teedteen pregnancyrates are the highest inLatinAmerica. Also,


 16. Teachers are defined as qualified if they have a teaching certificate and have the aredsubject knowledge for
the gradelsubjectthey are teaching.

progress in improving provision o f key services appears to have stalled during 2000-2005,
especially in areas such as the coverage o f pre-natal care (which oscillated between 72 and 75
percent), the share o f births attended by health personnel (between 53 and 58 percent), and the
coverage o f polio vaccination (between 85 and 87 percent). Within the health system, there are
still large inequities in access to, and quality of, health services across socio-economic groups
and regions. Inaddition, the public sector has focused largely on curative health inthe past. The
efficiency o f public expenditures, the stewardship role o f the health ministry (MINSA), multi-
sector coordination to improve health and nutrition outcomes, targeting priority investments to
less served areas, outreached activities o f core interventions, private and public partnerships to
reach remote areas, drug management and the capacity o f the Ministryto implementthe national
health strategy require further strengthening.

54.      Government Actions. The new strategy focuses on the implementation o f a preventive
health strategy, providing basic and specialized health services with higher quality and better
targeting mechanisms, and the development o f an articulated strategy for the Caribbean Coast.
This will be done through the implementation o f the Family and Community Health Model
(Modelo de Salud Familiar y Comunitario, MOSAFC), which integrates interventions to
promote maternal health, nutrition, reproductive health and HIV/Aids strategies, by seventeen
decentralized local area health systems (SILAIS). In terms o f internal efficiency, MINSA has
developed a plan that involves a revision o f the human resource allocations, the fiduciary
capacities o f the central administration and the supervision and monitoring o f the regional
decentralized units. Key actions beingplanned by the Government inthis sector include:

   The implementation o f the National Health Services Strategy (Estrategia Nacional de
   Servicios de Salud) through the MOSAFC, with a focus in the regions with the highest
   mortality andwith mechanisms to monitor the quality o f birth services.

    A greater emphasis on prevention and promotion o f better health practices with an effective
    community mobilization, reflected in an increase in the share o f resources dedicated to
    prevention and promotion services, and

    Improvement in the access to, and quality of, services, with special focus on the poor and
    vulnerable groups.

55.      The Government's implementation of a plan to reduce maternal mortality in the six
departments with the highest maternal mortality incidence (Matagalpa, Jinotega, MAN, M A S ,
Chontales and Managua), focusing on the adoption o f new procedures to improve access and
quality o f services, i s a prior action for this DPC.

56.      Expected Results. Inresponse to these measures, the authorities expect to achieve (i)  an
increase in coverage o f deliveries in health institutions by professional health care providers,
especially in those municipalities with high mortality rates, (ii)  improvements in the quality of
services through the mainstreaming o f the MOSAFC, measured by the reduction inwaiting times
and the quality o f birthservices, and (iii) development o f a programto improve the quality o f
                                               the
services. In particular, it is expected that the proportion o f births attended in health units will

increase, at the national level, from 62 percent (in 2006) to 78 percent (in 2008) and to 79
percent (in2010).'~

Nutrition

57.      Kev Issues. Although the prevalence of stunting inNicaragua for children under 5 years
old declined since the late 1 9 9 0 ~more than one child in five (22 percent in 2005) still suffers
                                              ~
from chronic malnutrition - mostly as a result of poor access to health and water/sanitation
services and inadequate knowledge and caring practices. This has dramatic, irreversible, impacts
on their health, cognitive development and lifetimeproductivity and hence a large impact on the
economic development of Nicaragua. At the current rate of decline, it would take over 20 years
to eliminate stunting as a public health issue. To reachthe related MDG goal, rapid advances are
needed across several sectors, including expanding access to water and sanitation, expanding
growth promotion inchildren under 2, launching prevention campaigns, and improving access to
maternal and child healthcare and practices. In addition, the country does not currently count
with mechanisms to monitor the nutritional status of its population, or with clear protocols for
child growth monitoringand counseling.

58.       Government Actions.            In the past few years Nicaragua has developed a number of
innovative preventive health and nutrition programs, including a community-based program
(PROCOSAN) and an early child development program (PAININ) managed through the
Ministry of the Family (MIFAM) that actively engages families, communities and service
providers in maintaining the adequate growth of young children. The administration has made
addressing chronic malnutrition a top policy priority, as reflected by: (i)                     the inclusion of this
indicator inthe framework of the multi-donor budget support financial agreement; (ii) revival               the
of the national nutrition and food security commission, led by MINSA, to promote an inter-
institutional approach to improve nutrition amongst children; and (iii) launch of the National
                                                                                          the
Micronutrient Program focused on supplementation (vitamin A and iron) and fortification (salt
with iodine, sugar withvitaminA, and flour with ironandfolic acid). Key actions beingplanned
by the Government inthis sector include,

0    Strengthening the national nutrition monitoring system (SISVIN) to allow regular follow up
     andanalysisof all healthy children's check ups;

0    Adoption of standardized protocols and instruments, and establishment of a system to
     monitor children's health and nutrition, in the context of implementing the early child
     development program (PAININ) in66 poor municipalities;

0    Adoption of a national plan for the reduction of chronic malnutrition focused on children
     undertwo; and

0    Mainstreaming o f standardized protocols o f a growth promotion system in the Family and
     Community HealthModel (MOSAFC).


 17. This increase in coverage does not follow a linear progression. The large initial increase inthe proportion of
institutional births is largely due to the reduction in the cost o f the relevant basic health services. These costs were
considered to have been a major barrier to access in the past. Subsequent gains in the proportion of institutional
births are projected to accrue more slowly, as they require the expansion of basic infrastructure and medical
personnel to very remote areas.

                                                            19

59.      The initiation of a process to strengthen Nicaragua's child nutrition and development
monitoring system by updating standards and developing new instruments in the context of the
PAININ program in 66 poor municipalities (with an emphasis on prevention and promotion of
health amongst pregnant and lactating women and children under the age of two) is a prior
condition for this DPC.

60.       Expected Results. By the end of 2008, it is expected that the instruments necessary for
the implementation of the child growth promotion protocols will be defined, including the base
line inthe 66 municipalities where the PAININ program is to be implemented. Over the medium
term, these actions are expected to contribute to a significant reduction in the prevalence of
chronic malnutrition among children under the age of 2 in the areas of intervention (poorest
municipalities of Nicaragua), the capacity to monitor the evolution of chronic malnutritionat the
national level, and the multi-sectoral coordination of efforts to combat chronic malnutrition
among children under two years of age. The absence of a baseline and clear protocols for
monitoring the nutritional status of children under 2 years has severely limited the government's
capacity to monitor the nutritional status of children. With the implementation of this prior
action, the government will be in a position to monitor child malnutrition on an annual basis,
permitting an earlier and better government responseto the evolution o f malnutritionindicators.

Water and Sanitation

61.       Key Issues. Water and sanitation access rates in Nicaragua are among the lowest for
Latin American countries. According to the Nicaragua Poverty Assessment Report (2007), it is
unlikely that Nicaragua will reach the 2015 MDG target for water (85 percent), due to existing
management practices and low investment levels. The MDG target for sanitation (73 percent) is
very unlikely to be achieved by 2015 as well'*. The World Health Organization (WHO) and
UNICEF Joint Monitoring Program (JMP/2006) report that total access to improved water
supply is 79 percent and to improved sanitation 47 percent. Access to safe water inurbanareas i s
relatively high (90 percent), with 84 percent of the urban population having access to a piped
water connection. However, continuity, quality and efficiency of water service provision in
Nicaragua are generally poor, so effective access to water might be lower. The share of water
that does not generate revenues is estimated at 56 percent and interruptions in the provision are
common. The current administration wants to prioritize measures for increasing effective water
coverage inurban areas, especially in Managua. Sanitation coverage, on the other hand, i s low,
with 56 percentofurbanpopulation having access to improved sanitation (as definedby the Joint
Monitoring Program) and only 22 percent to a sewerage conne~tion.'~Access to improved water
supply in rural areas has increased significantly from 46 percent in 1990 to 63 percent in 2006,
but only 27 percent has access to a piped water connection, hence, investments for increasing
access to water in rural areas remain a challenge. The Joint Monitoring Program reports that
access to improved sanitation inrural areas has increased from 24 percent in 1990 to 34 percent
in2006.


18. NicaraguaPoverty Assessment Report, The World Bank, 2007. ReportNo. 39736-NI
19. In Managua, only 20 of 142 neighborhoods have access to a sewerage network constructed by the national
urban water utility, ENACAL. This lowers both public confidence in the utility and willingness to pay for the
service, furthering the well-known vicious cycle ofpoor quality of service resulting inpoor revenues.

                                                        20

62.     Limited institutional capacities (including the regulator, INAA, and the sector policy-
making body, CONAPAS), an inconsistent legal framework, and excessive political interference
have been the underlying factors impeding water coverage expansion and service quality
improvements. A positive development in strengthening the sector framework was the recently
approved Law of National WatersY2'which creates the National Water Authority and the
National Council of Water Resources (focused on integrated water resources management) and
proposes a new institutional arrangement where ENACAL is responsible for strategic planning
and investment in water and sanitation in urban areas, while FISE is responsible for the rural
areas. The new administration, however, also is reluctant to promote private sector participation
in this sector, with the result that ENACAL eliminated two ongoing private management
contracts for two major cities. Nevertheless, ENACAL has expresseda commitment to generate
the same efficiency results as the private sector and has recently proposed a revision of tariffs
that could open the badly needed discussion on hidden and indirect subsidies. It will be
important to monitor and support ENACAL's progress as it is the main service provider inurban
areas.

63.      The sector has been lacking sound financial policies, while decisions on expenditure
priorities, particularly investments, have been largely driven by emergency and political
considerations, very rudimentary planning by ENACAL and FISE, and donor offers of grants
and concessionary loan financing*'.           Donor contributions cover almost all investment
financing22.Sector performance still has to improve interms of facilitating access of the poor to
water and sanitation services, complemented by a comprehensive approach to sanitation and
hygiene, under a sound sector financial planning and better focused subsidies that improve the
effectivenessof public expenditures.

64.      Government actions. The government issued implementing regulations for Law 620 on
November 7, 2007 (Official Gazette No. 214) and has ensured that the newly created National
Council of Water Resources and the National Water Authority have adequate resources to
function inthe 2008 budget. It has also recently presenteda draft update of the National Water
and Sanitation Strategy. These actions seek to ensure a shared vision on the management of
water resources in the country, including in the water and sanitation sub-sector.                      Sector
investments will contribute to enhancing the quality of life of population by improving health
and hygiene through safer water and sanitation services. Government agencies in charge of
serving rural and urban population will seek to ensure effective coverage of water services, i.e.
the percentage of households that have access to water with quality and continuity (and not as
measured by the number of existing connections). Nonetheless, a baseline and adequate
indicators for these goals deserve further discussion, including its adequacy in the case of rural
water. The World Bank also is supporting the expansion of water coverage in urban and rural
areas through two separate water and sanitation projects, which are concurrently under

operational performance, withproject support from IDB.

65.     The Government's enactment of regulations to begin implementingthe National Water
Law N o . 620, passed in August 2007). which modernizes the sector institutional framework, i s
aprior action for this DPC.

66.     Expectedresults. With the official approval of the Regulations for the Law of National
Waters, which came into effect on March 4, 2008, and an updated Water and Sanitation Sector
Strategy in 2008, the authorities have modernized the sector institutional framework and,
thereby, eliminated an important institutional bottleneck to water coverage expansion and service
quality improvements. With respect to potable water services in urban areas, the government
expects to increasethe effective coverage level from 65 percent in2007 to 70 percent by the end
of 2008, and to 82 percent by 2010. The authorities also are seeking to expand water and
sanitation targets in rural areas, for which they are in the process of preparing a baseline for
measuring future advancesinthe effective coverage rates.


              IV.     BANK SUPPORTOF THE GOVERNMENT PROGRAM


A. Linkto the CPS

67.     Proposednew lending inthe Country Partnership Strategy for FY 08-12 is anchored in a
series of annual budgetary support operations to engage the government on key policy reforms,
while selectively undertaking up to five or six new investment operations in areas where the
Bank has comparative advantages. New financing indicatively amounts to US$240 million for
the five years covered by the CPS, plus an additional allocation of $12.7 million that became
available following conclusion of the IDA 15 replenishment, of which $80 to $100 million could
be provided through budget support. These operations, together with the associated technical
assistance credit (PSTAC-2) would allow the Bank to engage in the overall reform program of
the Government in governance and public sector modernization, the investment climate and
improvements in social service provision, as well as to maintain engagement in the social
sectors, for which no new investment operations are envisaged. New investment operations
would be limited to urban and rural water and sanitation, public sector management, land
administration, and rural roads. Table 3 shows the link betweenthe lines of actions supported
under the proposed DPC and specific CPS outcomes to which these actions are expected to
contribute.

B. Collaborationwith the IMFand Other Donors

68.      Duringthe period covered by the last CAS andInterimStrategy Note, and during the first
year of the new CPS, the Bank has collaborated very closely with the IMF and other donors.
With respectto the IMF,this collaboration has taken several forms, including Bank participation
inIMF missions and reliance on each other's findings inorder to avoid duplication and ensure
consistency of advice to the authorities. The collaboration has beenparticularly close inthe areas
of public expenditure and financial management, civil service reform and the energy sector. The
Bank andthe IMF also undertook ajoint debt sustainability analysis inthe summer of 2007. The
Bank has also advised the Fundon the non-binding social sector indicators included inthe new
PRGF agreement for 2007-2009, whose letter of intent was signed in August of 2007. In
addition, a JSAN was prepared in 2006 and another will be prepared upon receiving the
Government's revised National HumanDevelopment Plan inmid-2008.

69.      In May 2005, the Bank and members of the donor community that provide budget
support to Nicaragua, signed a Joint-Financing Arrangement (JFA) and developed a first
common Performance Assessment Matrix (PAM), which was intended to facilitate the
monitoring and evaluation of the Government's policy actions. A new P A M matrix, muchmore
streamlined, was negotiated with the government in November 2007 and i s the basis for the
proposed DPC.          The Bank's participation in the Budget Support Group (BSG) reflects the
importance being given to policy-based lending and to harmonizing efforts, especially in the
areas of public expenditure and financial management, governance and the development o f
social and human capital development. DPC preparation and the design of its monitoring and
evaluation provisions were especially closely coordinated with the BSG.

70.      No direct co-financing is expected for this DPC. German financial cooperation through
KfW, which co-financed PRSC Iand 11, does not include budget support for 2008, due to a
decision of the German parliament to review this instrument. (Nevertheless, KfW plans to

                                                      23

maintain support for the water and sanitation sector, which has been a focal point for the KfW,
through sector-specific instruments.)

C. Relationshipto other BankOperations

71.      Virtually all areas of PRSC Iand I1were linked to the Bank's investment portfolio in
Nicaragua, and associated analytical and advisory activities, and this practice will be continued
for the DPC and subsequentPRSCs. While the DPC would continue to provide policy backing
for sector investment operations in particular areas, the investment credits and analytical and
advisory activities provide implementation follow-up and data necessary for monitoring and
evaluation. Supervision of the DPC and subsequent PRSCs i s virtually an ongoing process;
every related Bank investment project supervision and AAA mission is responsible for the
surveillance of the related DPC policy actions. As stated above, no new investment operations
are envisaged at this time inthe human development sectors, meaning that the DPC and possible
follow-up budget support operations become key vehicles for engagement.

D. LessonsLearnedfrom PreviousPRSCs

72.      As pointed out in the Implementation Completion and Results (ICR) Report of PRSC-I
and PRSC-11, a basic finding from the two preceding budget support operations is that even
though all prior actions to trigger the credits have been met, the number and share of people
living inpoverty was not reduced. This unsatisfying outcome may be reflecting one or more of
the following: (i) instruments for measuring poverty in all o f its dimensions may be too
                       our
weak to reflect the impact of policy measures supportedby the PRSCS?~(ii)                 the policy measures
may take a longer time to exert their full impact thanthe three year period over which impact has
been measured, and (iii) policy actions in question may simply not have been effective for
                               the
reducing poverty. In response to this basic finding, the DPC focuses on strengthening the
information basis for monitoring and delivering basic social services, while advising the
authorities to give particular attention to the development of adequate monitoring and evaluation
systems inupdating the country's poverty reduction strategy.

23. As noted earlier, even though the share of the population residing under the poverty line has hardly changed
between 2001 and 2005, the average distance to the poverty line diminished significantly, which arguably reflects
some reduction in poverty that is not captured by the poverty rate. More importantly, the intervals over which
poverty has been measured inNicaragua- generally every 3 to 5 years - are too long to give adequate feedback to
the authorities on whether their policies are havingan impact onpoverty or not.

                                                         24

73.   Other important lessonspointed out inthe ICR Report are the following:

   Close and real coordination with other development assistance partners is essential to the
   success and continuity of policy-based lending, as it provides the necessary financial and
   political leverage. Nevertheless, national ownership of a reform agenda i s a critically
   necessary condition that became evident throughout the last CAS and ISN periods.
   Institutional reforms can only be successful with political consensus and unwavering
   government commitment, at all levels, for a sustainedperiod oftime
   As in many countries, national development efforts and donor coordination have been
   hampered over the years, not only by weaknesses of national leadership in development
   planning, as evidenced by the long delays in the production of the 2005 version of the
   National Development Plan and its revision by the Ortega administration, but also by the lack
   of planning continuity from administration to administration. Nicaragua will need ongoing
   support to strengthen its planning capabilities at sector and national levels to establish a
   strong framework for the effective and sustainable orientation of donor assistance.
   Single-tranche operations, wherein all prior actions are accomplished before Board
   presentation, have fewer operational difficulties and provide the right incentives to the
   borrower, by rewarding self-determined and self-decided actions, rather than "buying" policy
   reforms that can always be reversed subsequently. Ideally, these should be yearly operations.
   From the borrower's perspective, this also allows closer coordination with the national
   budget cycle and more predictability of financial assistance. Accordingly, the amount of the
   operation needs to be commensurate with its one-tranche design, as well as the timing o f
   intendeddevelopment objectives. For this to be possible, the Bank needs to assign sufficient
   administrative resources for project preparation. Finally, yearly operations allow closer
   harmonization with other donors, particularly those in the BSG which has a pre-defined
   schedule for supervision agreedinthe JFA.
   Indicators for achievement of Policy Development Objectives should be directly linked to
   prior actions supported by the operation to provide a consistent basis for ex-post evaluation.
   However, there is still a need for the GON to increase its capacity to monitor and evaluate
   and to produce reliable in a timely manner. The Bank should, in coordination with other
   donors, continue to support the strengthening o f Nicaragua's national statistical agency,
   INIDE, and its systems for Monitoring and Evaluation, as well as administrative systems of
   key line ministries. The possibility to introduce some incentives for reporting monitoring
   indicators, including the possibility of reducing disbursements in cases of non-compliance,
   should be analyzedby operational policy staff.
0  Over the last five years the Bank has greatly strengthenedits in-country presence andthat has
   been an important factor in improving capacity to monitor the PRSC matrix and has
   strengthenedthe Bank's leadership role in policy dialogue, especially within the context of
   the Budget Support Group.

E. AnalyticalUnderpinnings

74.    The Bank has prepared several analytical and fiduciary reports on Nicaragua over the
past few years that were taken into account in the design of the proposed operation. These
reports include a Development Policy Review (2004), Country Financial Accountability
Assessment (2004), Public Expenditure Review (2007), Institutional & Governance Review
(2007) and Poverty Assessment (2008). The main findings from each of these analytical studies
andtheir links to the DPC policy matrix are summarizedinAnnex 3.

F. StakeholderConsultations

75.    Preliminary consultations on the provision of budget support to Nicaragua already had
takenplace in2007 inthe context ofthe consultations onthe Country Partnership Strategy 2008-
2012.    These earlier consultations were followed up during the appraisal mission for this
operation with several meetings with representatives of various non-governmental organizations
that includeduniversities and other research centers, labor unions, women's organizations, rural
networks, municipal associations, environmental organizations, the private sector and the
Council on Economic and Social Policies, CONPES). In addition, meetings were held with
members of the Economic Commission of the National Assembly. During these meetings, the
participants demonstrated a high level of commitment, in spite of strong differences in
viewpoints in many of the areas addressed by the DPC. Various organizations expressed the
need to reach a national consensus on fundamental aspects of the country's poverty reduction
strategy (Plan Nacional de Desarrollo Humano), and voiced support for the policies directed at
strengtheningand modernizing public sector management(prior actions 1 and 2 for this DPC) as
useful instruments for combating corruption and promoting greater citizen participation. With
regardto the social sector measures supported by the DPC (prior actions 3-6), participants inthe
meetings expressed concern about the slow progress made heretofore in improving social
indicators and indicated a need to redouble efforts inthis area. On the whole, the meetings drew
a generally positive response from all the participants, who asked to be maintained informed
about any new developmentsinrelation to the DPC.


                           V.      THE PROPOSEDOPERATION


A. OperationDescription

76.    The proposed DPC is a one-tranche, stand-alone credit operation to support the
implementation of the initial phase of the Nicaraguan government's new development program.
Itbuildsonthe recently endedseries ofPRSCsandserves as an instrumentfor dialogue with the
government as it prepares and consults its up-dated poverty reduction strategy, which it expects
to complete in September 2008. The policy matrix presented in Annex 2 summarizes the key
actions supported by this credit, with a focus on two broad thematic areas comprising (i) public
sector and financial management, and (ii) social andhumancapital development.




                                               26

77.     No triggers for a follow-up operation have been proposed, given that this DPC is
conceived as a stand-alone operation. Nevertheless, the policy matrix in Annex 2 also presents
follow-up activities that are beingplannedby the authorities inthe mediumterm.

B. Prior Conditionsfor the DPC

78.      The policy actions supported by this DPC are drawn from the common Performance
Assessment Matrix (PAM), which was agreed between the Government and the Budget Support
Group, including IDA, inNovember 2007. The PAM includes 20 programmatic lines of action
and associated indicators to serve as measuresof program implementation. Six of these twenty
lines of action are being proposed as triggers for this operation, in addition to the over-arching
condition that calls for the maintenance of an adequate macroeconomic framework.                            These
actions, which would have to be completed prior to Board presentation to enable the
disbursement oftheproposed credit amount, are listed inBox 1.


                         Box 1. Prior Actions for Board Presentation of the DPC

    Implementation of Civil Service Reform. The Government has advanced in the implementation of Civil
    Service Law No. 476 through the accreditation o f public servants covered by the law (excluding teachers, health
    workers, policemen and soldiers) inline with its Strategic Civil Service Plan.

    Modernization of Public Finances. The Government has made satisfactory progress in modernizing public
    finances on the basis o f Laws Nos. 440, 477 and 323 through measures that have strengthened the central
    government's budgeting, treasury, accounting and public credit functions.

    Dissemination of EducationAchievement Results. The Government has presentedits report on the results o f
    the 2006 student learning achievement tests to the national education commission and on the Ministry of
    Education's web page, and prepared a planto disseminate these results to all teachers, school directors and civil
    society during2008.

    ReducingMaternal Mortality. The Government has begunto implement a planto reduce maternal mortality in
    the six departments with the highest maternal mortality incidence (Matagalpa, Jinotega, MAN, M A S ,
    Chontales and Managua), focusing on the adoption o fnew procedures to improve access and quality o f services.

    Improved Monitoring of Child Nutrition. The Government has initiated a process to strengthen its child
    nutrition and development monitoring system by updating standards and developing new monitoring instruments
    in the context of the PAININ program in 66 poor municipalities, with an emphasis on preventive care and
    promotion o f health among pregnant and lactating women and children under the age o f two.

    Improved Legal Framework for Water & SanitationServices. The Government has enactedthe regulations
    to begin implementing the National Water Law (No. 620 o f August 2007), which modernizes the sector
    institutional framework.


79.      The six prior actions being supported by this DPC build on earlier efforts supported by
previous PRSCs. This is particularly true for the actions inthe area of public sector management
and transparency, which continue along the same programmatic lines as before. While the other
prior actions also buildon earlier reform efforts ineducation, health andnutrition, other elements
of the sector strategies have changed under the current administration, with the consequencethat




                                                        27

only some o f the policy areas identified inthe PRSC-I1Program Document as potential triggers
for future budget support operations are includedinthe PAM or inthis DPC.                    24


80.       Inaddition to achieving the prior actions listed inBox 1, the Nicaraguan authorities also
have succeeded in maintaining a stable macroeconomic framework. As indicated earlier
(paragraphs 12-13), macroeconomic management has remained broadly favorable since the
Ortega Administration assumed office, though inflation jumped to double digits, mainly
reflecting supply shocks. Fund staff noted that all quantitative targets under the program through
end-2007 were met with ample margins, as well as most quantitative targets through end-June
2008, except for a small shortfall in the accumulation of reserves. Also, all structural criteria
established in the PRGF program through end-2007 have been met, albeit with some delays.
Completion of the first review nevertheless was delayed on account of the threat to financial
stability triggered by a court order in April 2008, suspending the central bank's debt service on
bonds heldby the two largest Nicaraguan banks. As discussed earlier (paragraph 15), corrective
actions were subsequently taken to reduce this threat and the IMF expects to complete the first
PRGF program review by mid-September2008, assuming the implementation of the remaining
prior actions that were still pending as of mid-August 2008. These prior actions refer to the
formalization of the banking superintendence's decision to grant forbearance in applying certain
accounting standards, and the publication of a report on official external aid. Both prior actions
are expectedto be completed by end-August 2008.

C. ExpectedOutcomes

81.       The measures and reforms supported by this operation will be evaluated on the basis of
outcomes that can be measured at the end of 2008 or early 2009. These expected outcomes are
summarizedinTable 5 andpresentedinmore detail inthe DPC Policy Matrix inAnnex 2. Table
5 also presents the medium term government objectives relating to each of these outcome
indicators. These are presentedfor overall program tracking purposes, in the understanding that
they are likely to require additional policy measures beyond those supported under this
operation.

D. CreditAmount

82.       The total credit amount proposed for this operation and envisaged inthe CPS is US$ 20
million equivalent.       This is lower than the amounts disbursed in previous PRSCs, which
averagedUS$ 33 million per tranche. Once the program re-design i s completed inthe context of



24. The Program Document for the Nicaragua PRSC-I1had tentatively identified(inBox 5) eight policy areas of
expected progressthat could be supportedunder a new series of PRSCs. These policy areas comprise (i)        the titling
and registration of indigenous territories, (ii)approval of a national properties registry law, (iii)reforms of the
school autonomy regime, (iv) de-concentration of water enterprises managed by ENACAL, (v) legal and
institutional reforms inthe electricity sector, (vi) design of a comprehensive public sector wage law, (vii) measures
to improve the impact of poverty reducing expenditures, based on incidence studies, and (viii) the revision of the
municipal and fiscal transfer laws as part of a decentralization strategy. While this DPC supports actions in the
areas of education, water & sanitation, human resource management and the targeting of poverty-reduction
spending, the type of actions being supported are substantially different from those envisioned by previous
Administrations.

   an updated PRSP and the authorities develop a track record in program implementation, future
   budget support couldbe scaledup.



                                Box 2. Good Practice Principles on Conditionality
Principle 1: Reinforce Ownership: This operation has been designed around the new priorities expressed by the
Ortega Administrationin its progress report on the implementation of Nicaragua's PRSP-I1(National Development
Plan) and its Economic and Financial Programdocument (2007-2010), both of which were completed in August 2007.
In several cases, these priorities represent significant changes from those held by the previous administration and
reflected inprevious PRSCs. Since the authorities have not yet completedthe update of the PRSP, this operationwas
designed as a stand-alone operationbased on recently completed actions, without committingthe authorities to future
actionsthat are still inthe process ofbeingdefined.

Principle 2: Agree up front with the government and other financial partners on a coordinated accountability
framework - The prior actions listed in the policy matrix for this operation were drawn entirely from the joint
PerformanceAssessment Matrix agreedby the Government and Budget Support Group (of which IDA is a member) in
November 2007. IDA and the other members of the Budget Support Group are committedto this approach under the
Joint FinancingAgreement signedin2005.

Principle 3: Customize the accountability framework and modalities of Bank support to country circumstances.
The number of prior actions and triggers proposedin the policy matrix for this operation is significantly lower than in
previous budget support operation inNicaragua. This reflects an effort to limit the complexity of the operation in view
ofthe government's limitedimplementationcapacity, as well as to facilitate donor coordination.

Principle 4: Choose only actions critical for achieving results as conditions for disbursement. The policy matrix
has been simplified to include only 6 prior actions that needto be met in order to disburse the DPC, in addition to the
maintenance of an appropriate macroeconomicframework. As this is a stand-alone operation, no triggers have been
identifiedfor subsequentoperations.

Principle 5: Conduct transparent progress reviews conducive to predictable and performance-basedfinancial
support. The Bank, working closely with the IMF and other members of the Budget Support Group, is scheduledto
meet regularly with the government (under the auspices of the finance ministry) to review progressandassist as needed
inaddressingemerging issues. A review of the commonPerformanceAssessment Matrix, which will provide a list of
potentialtriggers for subsequent budget support operations, is scheduledto take place early during the annual budget
preparationprocess (June-September)to ensure predictable access to budget support resources.

                            VI.      OPERATION IMPLEMENTATION

A. Povertyand SocialImpacts

83.     The policies andmeasures supportedby this operation are expected to have a significant
impact on poverty-reduction and social indicators inNicaragua, provided that the government i s
able to follow through as plannedover the mediumterm. These policies and measures operate
mainly by helping to,

    strengthen public sector management through the modernization of public financial
    managementandthe creation of a stable, professional civil service, and
    improve the quality of social services, thereby improving the prospects of achieving the
    MDGs ineducation, child nutrition, maternal mortality and water & sanitation, through (i)               a
    better capacity to monitor and evaluate social service delivery with the publication of student
    learning achievement results and development of new instruments to monitor child
    malnutrition, (ii)the adoption of new procedures to reduce maternal mortality in poor
    municipalities, and (iii)    the implementation of a strengthened institutional framework for
    water & sanitation sector development.

84.     TheNicaragua Development Policy Review (2004) drew attentionto the needto improve
the quality and coverage of education and to improve governance, as two key determinants of
growth inNicaragua. The lack of sustainedgrowth, inturn, was identified as the main reasonfor
the slow progress in poverty reduction. With regard to governance, the CFAA (2004) drew
attention to shortcomings in the areas of public financial management and in the quality of the
civil service, both of which are being addressed in this DPC. The Poverty Assessment Update
(2007), together with previous PRSP Progress Reports, has drawn attention to the slow progress
being made in Nicaragua in achieving the MDGs pertaining to chronic malnutrition, maternal
mortality and access to water and sanitation services. Another relevant background study
includes a Poverty and Social Impact Assessment (PSIA) on the water & sanitation sector (in
2005), which drew attention to the needto revise water tariffs and system of water subsidies to
create a more sustainable sector financial framework, while taking into account the limited
payment capacitiesby poor fa mi lie^.^'

B. Implementation,MonitoringandEvaluation

85.     The program supported by this operation is being implemented by a Government team
led by the Ministryof Finance (MHCP), supportedby the vice-Ministry of External Relations in
charge of external cooperation and by the Planning Secretariat inthe Ministry of the Presidency
(SEPRES), and including representatives from each government agency involved in the policy
areas covered by the DPC (MINED, MINSA, MIFAM and INIDE). The monitoring of the prior
actions for this DPC and the evaluation of results at the end o f 2008 will be carried out by the
IDAtask team incollaboration withthis Governmentteam.


25.  Other PSIAs carried out for Nicaraguainrecent years analyzethe impact and incidence of (i)Public Spending
(2007), (ii)
           the Public InvestmentProgram(2005), (iii)the Educationfor All - FastTrack Initiative(2004) and (iv)
Tax Reform(2004)

                                                     31

86.     As the measures supported under the DPC form part of the PAM, the monitoring and
evaluation process will be closely coordinated with the other members of the Budget Support
Group in the context of the mid-termreview of the Program Assessment Matrix scheduled for
May of each year, with follow-up actions negotiated at the annual PAM review tentatively
scheduledfor September/October of eachyear.

87.     As noted earlier (paras. 45-46) the government is planning to prepare annual analyses of
public expenditures, especially those related to the execution of poverty reduction spending, as
well as to design and implement a poverty spending monitoring and evaluation system that
incorporates quality issues, such as incidence, coverage, efficiency and effectiveness indicators.
Plans also include identifying a methodology to measure the poverty and PRS socio-economic
indicators on an annual basis. As these plans materialize, they will also help in monitoring
progress inthe areas supportedby this DPC.

C. FiduciaryAspects

88.     The PFM diagnostics underpinning this operation include a Country Financial
Accountability Assessment (2004), Public Expenditure Review (2007), and Institutional &
Governance Review (2007) prepared by the World Bank, and a Public Financial Management
(PFM) Report preparedjointly by the Bank and other donors in 2006. These have concluded
that, in general, Nicaragua's public financial management systems are adequate for this
operation. The PFM Report notes that while challenges remain, the government has taken
important steps to strengthenits public fiduciary control framework. This i s an ongoing process
that is being supportedby IDA through the PS-TAC and that forms part of the actions supported
by this DPC series inthe area of public financial management.

89.     The Technical Memorandum of Understanding of August 24, 2007, agreed betweenthe
Government and IMF in connection with the current three-year PRGF arrangement, points
toward some gaps in the financial reporting, audit and control mechanisms of the Central Bank
of Nicaragua that were identified by an IMF safeguards assessment mission in July 2007. The
Memorandum also notes that the authorities are seeking to strengthen these mechanisms in an
expeditious manner. IDA will collaborate closely with IMF staff in monitoring the progress
made by the Authorities in implementing the key measures required to strengthen the control
mechanisms.

D. DisbursementandAudit

90.     IDA would make the single loan disbursementto a dedicated account that forms part of
the country's official foreign exchange reserves at the Central Bank of Nicaragua. The
disbursement would be made upon IDA'Sassessment that none of the prior actions for Board
presentation has been reversed. After the deposit of DPC proceeds, the Central Bank of
Nicaragua would immediately credit the disbursed amount to the Ministry of Finance Treasury
Single Account, thus becoming available to finance budgeted expenditures. Within a week of
this operation, the Ministry will accordingly provide the Bank with a written confirmation. The
Central Bank of Nicaragua i s the financial agent of government. Basedon the review o f external
audit reports and the experience with special accounts for investment lending, nothing came to

                                                32

the attention ofthe Bankthat would indicate that the banking control environment into which the
loanproceedswill flow is other than adequate.

E. EnvironmentalAspects

91.     The specific policies and actions supported by this operation are not expected to entail
significant impacts on the environment, forests and other natural resources. As noted in the
Program Document for PRSC-11, most of the environmental policies and practices inNicaragua
are based on the Environmental and Natural Resource Law o f 1996, which is administered by
MARENA. This law establishes the conditions under which an environmental assessment of
development activities is required and the procedures to be followed in preparing such
assessments, while mandating public consultations with the affected partieskommunities to
discuss potential impacts and their mitigation. A Country Environmental Analysis (CEA) for
Nicaragua has been programmed for FY09 to examine pressing environmental issues, evaluate
institutional capacities and constraints, and develop strategies for promoting environmentally
sustainable development.

92.      Policy actions intended to expand effective coverage of potable water in urban areas
would require particular attention in terms of increased production of potable water, more
efficient water systems to deliver the service and improvements in the sewer network and
wastewater treatment. The US$45 million Managua water and sanitation project under
preparation (Board date in the first half of FY09) is a category B project. It does not include
funding for wastewater treatment, but will help ENACAL extend the water and sewer network in
the capital city - the largest system of the country. The proposed water works usually generate
only minor negative environmental effects, most of them temporary. The extension of the sewer
network does create a potential environmental impact which is being looked at inthe context of
an on-going Environmental Impact Assessment prepared by ENACAL with funding from the
PHRD grant linked to the preparation of two IDA water projects. This work will provide
ENACAL with a set of specific environmental mitigation measures to be taken during project
implementation. On the other hand, the positive impacts are to be seen in terms of better
environmental conditions inurban households that contribute to important health outcomes such
as reducing water-related diseases, child malnutrition and maternal mortality.

93.      Nevertheless, the fact that a large wastewater treatment plant i s being built in Managua
with funding from KfW andthe Nordic Fund (designedto serve the expecteddemanduntil2020
considering the projected expansion of the sewer network by ENACAL), to which all of the
coverage extension i s to connect, will be a strong mitigating measure interms of improving the
sewerage service and the sanitation of Lake Managua (the second largest reservoir of water in
the country). ENACAL also is putting inplace differentmeasures to improvemaintenanceof the
systems, reduce nonrevenue water and losses, and it is carrying out institutional campaigns on
the use of potable water and preservation of water resources in coordination with other
institutions that will participate in the new water sector institutional framework created by the
newLaw ofNationalWaters andits Regulations that came into force this year.

F. Risks andRiskMitigation

94.    Nicaragua exhibits several important vulnerabilities that pose a threat to the development
objectives expected under this operation and the budget support operations that are expected to
follow.   These main sources of risk in this regard refer to (i)a fragile macroeconomic
framework, coupled with a vulnerability to external shocks, (ii)           the political environment, and
(iii)limitedinstitutionalcapacitytoimplementprograms. Eachisdiscussedbelow.
     a

95.     Macroeconomic Risks.            Although Nicaragua has advanced far since 2001 in
consolidating is macroeconomic framework, its overall public debt levels still remain high inthe
short to mediumterm, presenting a moderate risk of debt distress inthe event of adverse shocks.
As a small, open economy, Nicaragua is very vulnerable to movements inthe terms of trade, as
well as to natural disasters, such as hurricane Mitch and last year's hurricane Felix. The high
level of dollarization also poses a significant risk for the financial system. In that setting, the
near term risks facing Nicaragua are tilted to the downside. The most immediate macroeconomic
risk for Nicaragua is given by the economic slowdown in the U.S. and neighboring trading
partners, coupled with high food and fuel prices,26and the possibility of further price hikes. This
could lead to a significant drop in exports and remittance flows, put a brake on growth and
weaken the country's international reserve position.                   Three important risk-mitigating
developments inthis context are the recent approval of new PRGF arrangement with the IMF, an
increase in prospective aid flows from Venezuela and a better aid coordination mechanism
brought about with the creation of the Budget Support Group and agreement to participate in a
Joint Financing Agreement. Supervision of the DPC and the existence of a PRGF arrangement
provide a mechanism for monitoring macroeconomic developments in Nicaragua and alerting
against any destabilizing developments, while collaboration through the BSG facilitates a
concerted aid response when needed. Also, natural disaster risks are being partially addressed
through A M that aims, among other, to helpdesign a regional risk insurance mechanism.

96.     Political Risks. The Ortega administration has publicly announced its determination to
provide a welcoming environment for private investors. Informal discussions with private sector                ,

representatives,however, reveal an uncertain investmentclimate, which worsened inresponseto
the temporary government intervention of the privately owned oil refinery in 2007, the court-
induced suspension of central bank debt service inApril 2008, and ongoing tensions betweenthe
Executive branch of government (in alliance with the Judiciary) and the Legislative branch.
Adequate collaboration by the Legislature is needed to restore the quorum in the board of
directors of the central bank, without which the conduct of monetary policy will become
increasingly difficult. In the absence of improvements on these fronts, private investment
spending -which will be critical for raising the growth rate and reducing poverty - i s unlikely to
materialize. Another political risk refers to the approaching regional and municipal elections.
The two autonomous regional governments onthe Atlantic coast have elections scheduledfor the
end of 2008, while municipal elections in the rest of the country are scheduled for 2009. Both
will create pressures on the authorities to step up pre-election spending in an effort to accelerate
economic activity. Such measures could lead to a derailment of the program with the IMF.


26Although the current account of the BOPhas widened in 2007 and 2008, reflecting higher oil import prices, it
    remains comfortably financed with concessional external assistance and without posing an apparent threat to
    debt sustainability.

                                                    34

While IDA'Scapacity to mitigate these risks i s limited, given their political nature, efforts will be
made to engage key political leaders in annual consultations, and in collaboration with other
membersofthe BSG,to buildconsensus around some key policies.

97.     InstitutionalRisks. Nicaragua's limitedinstitutional capacity poses an important risk in
the context of new government initiatives that seek to promote universal access to social services
or credit by offering them free of charge or at subsidized rates (para. 22). Such initiatives may
not be fiscally sustainable and so would either undermine fiscal discipline or result in a
substantial deterioration inthe quality of social and other public services. To mitigate this risk,
Bank staff has beenseekingto engage the authorities inearly discussions on the elements of the
PRSP. There is also the risk that the limited institutional capacity of the government will prevent
follow-through on key actions planned for the mediumterm, beyond the prior actions taken for
this operation. This latter risk is being mitigated partly by the ongoing PS-TAC, as well as by
the ongoing and planned investment projects in the education, health, nutrition and water &
sanitation sectors, which are providing technical and other assistance in the implementation of
actions that are being supportedby this operation.

Mister
Robert B. Zoellick
President
World Bank
Washington, D.C.


                                                         Subject: Letter of Development Policy


Dear Mister Zoellick:

Since the Inauguration Day on January loth 2007, the Government of Reconciliation and
National Unity (GRNU) of the Republic of Nicaragua has announced publicly its priorities
focused on poverty reduction and economic growth, featuring a different strategic vision and an
innovative approach in designing social and economic policies, highlighting the social policy.
Macroeconomic stability and sustainability of both public finance and external accounts are also
relevant goals neededto create incentives that encourage economic growth and investment. We
are committed ourselves to create economic and institutional conditions in support of improved
public and private investment climate that revitalize fully the productive forces inorder to create
high-quality jobs.

Our social policy is consistent with the poverty reduction goal and it aims to ensure the delivery
of health, education, sanitation, food, social welfare, housing, and professional training services
andproducts for the poorest.

The GRNU promotes the citizen-based democracy so the people actually take part in processes
such as decision-making, management and evaluation of policies, plans and programs at
national, regional, departmental and local levels, as well as in problem-solving or making best
use of opportunities in neighborhoods, communities, districts or municipalities in form of self
management or joint management with the government structures. This course of action aims to
foster the integration o f citizens into the development process as both builders and direct
beneficiaries, acknowledging the right of each and every person to subsistence and human
realization.

The GRNU has reached an economic and financial agreement with the International Monetary
Fund (IMF) for 2007-2010, whereby the most important social affairs critical to the most
susceptiblepopulations were prioritized. This is an important sign not only for the private sector,
but also for vulnerable populations who need education, health, safe water and food. Within the
framework of this agreement, the government and donors ensure resources needed to fulfill the
goals and targets set forth inthat agreementthereof.




                                                51

However, this Administration expects not only favorable macroeconomic outcomes, but also the
improvement of major humandevelopment indicators above all else. Inthis sense, the fulfillment
of short and medium term poverty reduction indicators will accompany macroeconomic
indicators to assess the Economic - Financial Program performance. The rest of governmental
policies and actionsturn aroundthe accomplishment of this factor.

During the negotiations held with the IMF and the WB, as well as with Donors and the Budget
Support Group, it was agreed to write up a document that contains the priorities of the
Government of Reconciliation and National Unity, including its links with the previous National
Development Plan (as milestone regarded by Donors) and links with changes and continuum
factors.

In 2003, the International Community, during the Consultative Group meeting in October,
learned about a revised approach of that strategy called the National Development Plan (PND).
In 2007, the GRNU set out the need for reviewing this Plan to integrate its strategic vision in
how to fight poverty. Since early 2008, different commissions have been working on different
topics embraced by the new plan and inJuly 2008, the final draft of this Plan will be engrossed
andpresented.

Targets remain essentially the same, in terms of poverty reduction, economy revitalization,
enduring stability to attract foreign investment and improved human development indices.
However, the deterioration suffered by social sectors so far, the crises faced by public utility
companies and the soaring unemployment and inflation rates weighing Nicaraguan workers
down have determineda new order of priority that calls for changes inthe PND strategic content;
that is, changes introduced indefining policies and programs with direct impact rather than poor
populations. The foregoing construes the importance of loans insupport of development policies
as a bridge between the previous National Development Plan and this new National Human
Development Plan, which will be completed inthe middleof the year.

ThisNational Development Planwith ahumanface shall become a NationPlanto overcome the
poverty by means of the organization, participation and mobilization of the people, by working
together to intertwine programs permanently with the National Government, Local Governments
and Communities. A new generation of programs and projects will rise from new cooperation
agreements held with multilateral and bilateral development agencies, in line with the new
governmental priorities, looking for better investment and external indebtednessoutcomes.

The National Human Development Plan i s to be engrossed and presented to the International
Community inJuly 2008. Insteadof waiting untilits completion, on behalf of the Government of
Nicaragua, Iam hereby requesting this Development Policy Loan due to strategic reasons, such
as the macroeconomic stability and an ongoing fmitful policy dialogue for maintaining a
foreseeable periodicity inbudget support disbursements.

The Development Policies supported under this Credit are in line with four major guidelines or
development policy goals that are integral part of the new National HumanDevelopment Plan, as
follows: (i)Maintainmacroeconomic stability and improve public management; (ii)    Decreasethe
numbers of people living under poverty and abject poverty conditions by improving their


                                                52

standards of living and expanding the coverage of basic services package; (iii)Foster an
inclusive economic development by facilitating an appropriate business climate and supporting
the small enterprise and small farmers; (iv) Improve governability andjustice.



DEKELOPMENTPOLICY GOALS

I. MAINTAIN MACROECONOMIC STABILITY AND IMPROVE PUBLIC
       MANAGEMENT

MacroeconomicManagement

2007 was a year full of relevant economic and financial events that affected the economy in
different ways. On the one hand, the national economic activity benefited from the growing
world's demand for export primary commodities, including prices on the rise. These factors
helpedmaximize advantagesderivedfrom free trade agreements.Nonetheless, onthe other hand,
note that the skyrocketing oil prices have affected negatively production costs as Nicaragua i s
entirely an oil importer.

Note also that major foreign aid flows and the significant World Bank's support in the external
trade debt repurchaseprocesshelpedimplementthe governmental economic - financial program
and, concurrently improved the country's solvency status.

The fulfillment of goals and commitments set forth in the economic and financial program
regarding tax and monetary matters ensured the continuance of the macroeconomic stability,
which inturnpropped up the optimal performance of economic affairs in2007. Au contraire, the
power industry structural deficiencies translated into power outages that negatively affected the
production and prices. In addition, delays in executing the public investment program and
unexpected vile weather phenomena were the main causes that prevented the economy from
growing at the rate projected inearly 2007.

Real GDP for 2007 was 3.8'30, slightly lower than expected by the Central Bank of Nicaragua
(4.2%). Accumulated inflation rate peaked 16.9%, exceeding the figures projected in the
economic financial program. Underlying inflation, quite the opposite, stayed in a single-digit
rate.

From the supply's side, the most responsive activities were trade, financial brokerage,
transportation, communications, manufacturing and stockbreeding. The most dynamic businesses
interms ofjob creation were trade andthe manufacturingindustry.Concomitantly, the micro and
 small enterprises continued being the major job creators. They globally embrace 81% of people
with a job. The open unemployment rate was 4.9% (5.1% in November 2006). Despite of this
decreasing trend, the Employment Survey in 2007 still reflects high informal employment rates:
 62.7% (64.4% in 2006). The rise of employment rate was escorted by a nominal wage rise
though lower than inflation rate. Thus, the average real wage dropped by 6.6% despite of the
adjustedminimumsalary rate inforce as of June 2007.


                                                53

From the demand's side, major thrust came from consumption and private investments in
machinery and equipment, which offset the decreasing construction activities. Consumption
dynamics were propped out by a rising real income available and to a lesser extent by lower real
interest rates and expanding loansizes.

International reserves rose significantly (US$140 inexcess to the expectedlevel), covering up to
3.5 months of imports though the balance ofpayment current account deteriorated far beyond the
expectations, especially in view of skyrocketing oil prices, including oil by-products. The
expenses overrunning the income explains itself the current account deficit, which accounted for
up to 17.5% of the GDP. At sectorial level, the private sector accounts for most of the current
balance of payment deficit by increasing GDP by 5.3 points in comparison with 2006. On the
other hand, the public sector improved its overall deficit before donation by 1.3%.

Regarding taxes, for two years in a row, the Non Financial Public Sector has had a cash surplus
after donations that accounted for 1.6% of the GDP (0.7% in 2006). This i s caused by both a
good managementof income andthe support provided by donors, combined with an execution of
capital expenses lower than expected. These components compensated the increasing focused
expense (13.2% out of the GDP). Income continues being a key element in fiscal outputs. They
rose from 27.4% of the GDP in 2006 to 28.6% in 2007. This result comes mostly from INSS's
recovery portfolio, managerial improvements and a stronger operational position held by most
public companies.

Prospects for 2007 refer to make GDP grow not less than 4% and hold inflation back to a single
digit rate. This projection considers that the negative effect derived from U S economy slowness
will be offset by the positive thrust driven by agricultural recovery (plentiful basic grains
harvests, increased coffee production and boosted dynamism in agricultural and industrial
fields), as well as expanded construction activities derived fiom the public investment
expenditure. We also look forward to solving the electricity deficit, the continuance of high
international prices for our export commodities and the still strong world's economy growth.
Considering that the uncertainty in the international context i s rising, potential impacts on the
Nicaraguan economy causedby any change inthis sense are being closely monitored.

Fiscal policy shall remain in line with the economic - financial program, which sets out a goal
for the Consolidated Public Sector Financial Deficit to C$2.1 billion C6rdobas (approximately
1.8% out of the GDP). The National Budget has consistency with this criterion. We continue
endorsing the commitment to ensure a wage and salary policy corresponding to the increasing
nominal GDP. About 500 new teachers and 600 new health workers will be recruited to improve
the delivery of services inthese areas, inorder to fulfillthe MillenniumDevelopment Goals.




ImprovePublic Sector Management

To reach this goal, the GRNU is promoting an improved public service management and
transparency by turning civil servants into full professionals and upgrading public finance
management and social and poverty-related informationandmonitoring systems.


                                                 54

a. Civil Service Professionalization. Large-scale firing and hiring of civil servants following
  new political administrations have been a major obstruction that hinders the public sector's
  efficiency. To deal with this problem, they passed in November 19fh2003 and enacted in
  Decemberthe Civil Service andAdministrative Career Act No476 inthe GazetteNo235, and
   came into effect on June 8'h 2004 as public service and administration regulation,
   establishing the principle of job stability for public servants based on merits, capabilities,
   specialization and professionalism. It also establishes the following civil service entities: 1-
  the Civil Service Appeal Commission; 2 - the National Civil Service Committee; 3 - the
   MHCP Public Service Department; 4 - Human Resources Authorities. It also creates the
   Civil Service Position Classification System as database to define and implement the human
   resources management systems, as well as duties and rights and disciplinary procedures to
   settle any controversy or penalize any violation.

   For this reason, the government is promoting the Civil Service Accreditation Strategic Plan,
   having as medium-termobjective to accredit roughly 18,000 officials who represent 17% of
   civil servants working for the Central Government. In this sense, the Civil Service has
   accredited 7,517 public sector employees by late December 2007 and it i s expected to
   accredit at least a total o f 10,000 public sector employees (accounting for 9% o f the central
   government officials) by late 2008.

   Furthermore, the government is also supporting the institutional strengthening o f the Civil
   Service Appeal Commission (CSAC), which i s expected to be staffed and budgeted
   appropriately by late 2008.

   This type of actions will provide civil servants with jobs stability and ensure also the
   experience, expertise, know-how and historical memory in governmental agencies and
   ministries. Likewise, it stabilizes the investments on qualified human resources. We also
   carry on the commitment to ensure a humanresource managementpolicy consistent with the
   nominal GDP growth as part of a stable macroeconomic framework.


b. Improve Public Finance Management and Social and Poverty Data Monitoring and
   Information Systems
   So far, we have achieved significant attainments inmodernizing budget, treasury, accounting
   and debt management systems, but they need to be interwoven together to accomplish
   significant synergetic effects. Thus, the governmental strategy is based on implementing a
   Public Finance Modernization Plan aimed to (i)     develop and expand the SIGFA institutional
   coverage, especially in social sectors; (ii) strengthenthe public financial statistical system;
   (iii)modernize the MHCP (including the Internal Revenue Service - DGI and the Customs
   Service -DGA). The Plan will be implemented within the legal framework defined by the
   following laws: Budget and Financial Administration Act No550, the Public Debt Act No
   477, and the Government Procurement and Public Works Act No323, which reflect previous
   efforts to modernize public finance matters.




                                                 55

Improving the expenditure quality will become efficient by strengthening the Medium-Term
Budget Framework (MTBF), which i s currently employed by 25 entities and is expected to
be used by other 24 agencies by late 2010. Furthermore, the budget classification system
will be revised to have a result-oriented public budget and accounting development process
to strengthenthe implementation of a medium-termexpenditure framework (MTEF).

Regarding the debt management, the Government has been making efforts to integrate the
external debt databases administered by the Central Bank ofNicaragua and the domestic debt
databases administered by the MHCP by means of the SIGADE- Integrated Debt
Management System. This system has been in place as an integrated database since
September 2007. Having 2010 as medium-term goal, it is intendedto bring together SIGFA,
SNIP, SIGADE and the Government Procurement System. Currently, tests have been
implementedto develop a link between SIGFA and SIGADE and a financial link between
SIGFA and SNIP. Likewise, they are puttinginplace the State-ownedAssets System(SIBE)
in public agencies and entities to further control public assets. In this year, a SIBE pilot
project will be implanted in three public ministries (MINREX, MARENA and MHCP) to
assess its performance and make adjustmentsas appropriate for replication purposes.

They have launched electronic payments through Electronic Funds Transfer (EFT) in
municipalities where the financial system is available, superseding the old telephone-based
system. The new electronic fund transfer procedure employs SIGFA platform.

Some of specific public finance goals to be achieved by late 2008 are, including but not
limited to: 20 central government agencies using the SIGFA-based Monthly Cash
Programming, whereby central government officials are paid through electronic funds
transfers where available and 6 MINSA decentralized implementing units employing SIGFA
(Hospitals and SILAIS).

This Administration is intended to implement a monitoring and evaluation system to track
major development indicators, including a poverty-based calculation and baseline inview of
the absence of appropriate information and monitoring systems that restraints the
government's capability to fight poverty. This would enhance the successful implementation
of the National Human Development Plan. The Government - through the Nicaraguan
Development Information Institute, INIDE- intends to conduct ongoing household surveys
to:

    1. Establish an information system to track and monitor the labor market in Nicaragua
        andprovide informationrecurrently about the poverty evolution.
    2. Have informationinhandto compute net changes inemployment and unemployment
        volumes.
    3. Generate information about social, population and economic indicators to support
        policy-making and decision-making processes.

Ongoing household survey i s to include a module for household characteristics and public
services available. The income module was further refined for ongoing poverty evolution

       ABJECT POVERTY CONDITIONS BY IMPROVING THEIR STANDARDS OF
       LIVING AND EXPANDING THE COVERAGE OF BASIC SERVICES
       PACKAGE

Strengthenthe Deliveryof BasicSocial ServicesPackage
a. Increase efficiency, quality and accountability in Primary Education. The Government
   of Reconciliation andNational Unity (GRNU) aims as one of its major objectives to improve
   the education quality for Nicaraguan children. Thus, it is implementing a series of education
   policies and strategies that would have a short and medium-term impact on improved public
   education services as a result of the inherited absence of key strategies neededto increasethe
   primary education quality, associated to learning achievement monitoring, outcome
   indicators assessments andlearning standards.

   Inthis context, the educationpolicy is intendedto ensure free quality universal educationand
   decrease illiteracy rates. Achieving these goals impliesto design five core education policies:
   a) More Education, which refers to decrease illiteracy and increase preschool, primary and
   secondary education coverage; b) Improved Education to upgrade the education curriculum
   and school teacher training; c) Other Education to transform the education system's values;
   d) Participatory Decentralized Education Management to foster the linkage among all local
   and national education-related actors as an enterprise to be undertaken by all; e) All
   Education Levels to put together the different building blocks of the education system.

   The Government of Reconciliation and National Unity (GRNU) has launched a plan to
   rescue the education system, acknowledging that humancapital investment i s the linchpin of
   Nicaragua's economic and social development. To realize this principle, it has formulated a
   long-term education strategy aimed to retrieve the fundamentals of education, recognizing
   the Nicaraguan teacher as the pith and marrow of development and create quality education
   oriented to meet the needs of Nicaragua. This strategy i s launched under unfavorable
   circumstances, with an evolution falling behind for years, a deteriorated infrastructure,
   inadequate stocks of human capital and no resources available. The Government o f
   Reconciliation and National Unity (GRNU) is calling the International Community to come
   together to deal with this situation and at the same time develop this sector.

   Actions in the pipeline and in progress include: (i)   Implementa National Teacher Trainin   ,a
   Plan for primary school teachers; (ii)  Establish a baseline to put into operation a 4thand 6
   grades and 9* and llth curriculum; (iii)Conduct trial tests in pilot schools
                                 grades


                                                 57

  implementing the new curriculum for comparison purposes in 2009 and 2010 to feedback
  changes carried out; (iv) Put into action an strategy that ensures the education continuum in
  rural schools with an incomplete supply package.

  The government has the National 3'd and 6' grades Spanish and Math Achievement Tests
  Results Report for 2006, which was presented to the National Education Commissions and
  posted in the MINED website. It has developed a plan to disseminate said results among
  teachers, school principals and education community in2008. Inlate 2008, it is expectedthat
  National Spanish and Math Achievement Tests Results are widely disseminated among 750
   schools with the participation of the education-related community and civil society
  organizations. Also, 9000 3'd and 6'      grades Spanish and Math teaching guides will be
   facilitated to improve teachers' education practices.

b. Increased Access to Quality Health Services, with Special Emphasis on Poor
   Communities
   The health sector is one the most backward sectors interms of level, quality and coverage of
  health services. Maternal and infantile death rates are the highest indicators in Central
  America; infant nutrition levels are precarious and the health system coverage in rural areas
   i s bare little or nothing. A number of factors have a bearing on this situation, ranging from
  the health model strategic vision to the absence of appropriate funds allocated to the sector.
  Maternal death rate and pre-teen pregnancy rates are among the highest figures in Latin
  America, while access to health services, particularly inpoor communities, is almost hitting
  the bottom.

   Inthis sense, the health policy aims to increase public health service quality and coverage
   nationwide, with emphasis on poor communities. The Government of Reconciliation and
  NationalUnity (GRNU) has commencedits healthprogram by delivering free health services
  throughout the public health system to eradicate the private healthcare scheme within the
  public health system, including charges for these services. Furthermore, it is allocating
   increasingly resources to support a medicine supply program comprising expendable medical
   supplies, stocks of humanresources and nonmedical suppliesneededto meet the demandfor
   ambulatory and hospital healthcare. Likewise, the government i s renewing foreign assistance
   agreements inline with this healthpolicy.

   Inorder to decrease these negative indicators, the GRNU intendsto implement the National
   Healthcare Service Strategy through the Family and Community Health Model (MOSAFC)
  throughout the 17 SILAIS. It encompasses interventions in maternal care, nutrition,
   reproductive health and HIV/AIDS, employing revised procedures that put emphasis on
   preventive health.

   Regarding healthcare services renderedunder the social security scheme, the Government is
  promoting a healthcare insurance model that contains new regulations for the healthcare
   insurance companies that have undertaken this responsibility as well as the active
   involvement of the public health system in delivering these services. It is also foreseen to
  expand the medical benefit package in favor of Social security account holders by using in
   fullthe paymentsmadeunderthiscategory.


                                               58

  We have started implementing a plan to drop maternal mortality rates, focused on adopting
  innovative procedures to increase healthcare access and quality in the six top-ranked
  departments with death rates higher than the national average rate for the past five years
  (Matagalpa, Jinotega, RAAN, RAAS, Chontales and Managua). This has led to increase
  institutional birth delivery coverage, hoping to attain 78% nationwide by late 2008 if
  comparedto 62% in2006.

  This Maternal, Perinatal andNeonatal Death Containment Plan, includingan implementation
  monitoring schedule for prioritized SILAIS (RAAN, M A S , Chontales, Matagalpa, Jinotega
  and Managua) comprises a format to monitor the Maternal, Perinatal and Neonatal Death
  Containment Plan progress, as well as continuing follow-up by means of technical SILAIS
  visitation reports to keep an eye on the Maternal, Perinatal and Neonatal Death Containment
  Planperformance and generate comparative mortality status reports.

c. Strengthening the National Children's Growth Promotion and Systematic Nutrition
  MonitoringSystem.
   Over 20% of children suffer from chronic malnutrition due to the poor access to safe water
   and health services and the absence of proper mechanisms to monitor nutritional status in
  children under two years old. Inadequate feeding and nutrition during the most critical years
  of childhood, from intrauterine stage through the first three years reflect largely the high
  chronic under-5 malnutritionrates. This is a major public health concern and one o f the main
  intergenerational poverty transmission mechanisms.

   Fully aware of this situation, the Government of Reconciliation andNational Unity (GRNU)
   i s updating the children's growth and development surveillance standards through a pilot
   InfantGrowthandNutritionMonitoring Systemto beimplementedin66 municipalities, with
   emphasis on health prevention and promotion in breastfeeding or pregnant women and
   children under two years old. This system will be eventually integrated into MOSAFC. The
   Government has already developed and is currently implementing an ongoing national plan
   to decrease chronic malnutrition.

   Inlate 2008, the instrumentsneeded(including a baseline) to implementthe Infant Growth
   and Nutrition Monitoring System targeting under-2 children should in place across the 66
  poorest municipalities. Taking into consideration the fact that the child nutrition status
   capturesthe impacts from bothprimary health care andnutrition interventions, the nutritional
   monitoring system in the long run should be integrated into the national public health
  network and provide a sound basis for the health and nutrition program reporting. However,
   since administrative data inherently are biased (due to non randomly measurement
   exclusions), they need to be supported by painstaking surveys that infer accurately the
   nutritionaloutcome trends

   These actions aim to decrease chronic malnutrition indicators in under-2 children and to
   establish coordination and inter-sectorial intervention mechanisms to fight malnourishment
  nationwide.



                                               59

d. Improve Health and Sanitation by IncreasingWater Supply and Sanitation Coverage
   andQuality.
   Water supply in the Capital City, major cities and rural areas is deficient. Most poor
   population has no access to water supply while the pollution affecting natural sources of
   water jeopardizes the healthof the most vulnerable segments.

   This Government found out that state-owned water supply and sanitation companies were so
   undercapitalized that infrastructure, machinery and maintenance equipment are heavily
   depreciated. Neither previous governments nor international donors provided adequate
    support neededto solve water supply structural problems, which reflect hightechnical losses.
   Water supply and sanitation access rates inNicaragua rank among the lowest rates in Latin
   America, partially due to an inadequate legal framework that has hindered service quality
   improvements.

   As part of our ongoing efforts to increasethe WSS sector-wide performance, we are updating
   theNational Water Supply andSanitation Strategy, includingthe following focal points:
           Attain financial and technical sustainability and endeavor to reach social and
            environmental sustainability.
       0    Strengthen decentralized management systems by transferring functions and
           responsibilities to departmental andregional offices.
           Implement emergency investments to mitigate water supply shortage or deficiency
           problems.
           Increasewater supply coverage inurbanareas up to 85% in2012.
            Intensifypublic awarenesscampaignsto preserver water resources.

   Inorder to have amediumand longterm impact, we are launching aninvestment programto
   rehabilitate and expand the water supply sector infrastructure to expand coverage, decrease
   technical losses and preserve and clean up bodies of water within a financial sustainability
   framework. An important contribution to this Line of Action was the enactment by the
    GRNUof the National Water Act No620, inforce as of March2008. This law will empower
    us to improve the institutional framework of the water supply sector. Actions intended to
    improve and expand water supply systems in urban zones will bring up drinking water
    effective coverage from 65% in2007 to 70% in2008 and up to 82% in2010. Inrural areas, a
    WSS investment program will be implemented, containing alternative system solutions
    neededto improve access to water supply services, prioritizingthe poorest ruralpopulations.

    In order to assess the effectiveness of these measures, the Water Supply & Sanitation
    InformationSystem (SISAPS) will be establishedto provide timely informationfor informed
    decision-making  .


111.   FOSTER AN INCLUSIVE ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT BY FACILITATING
       AN APPROPRIATE BUSINESS CLIMATE AND SUPPORTING THE SMALL
       ENTERPRISEAND SMALL FARMERS




                                               60

To strengthenthe inclusive economic development and increasethe national productive capacity,
the GRNUi s implementing the following lines of action:


    0  Foster a sustainable rural development with gender equality that favors the efficient and
       effective delivery of services provided by public and private sectors, prioritizing small
       and medium producers and their families, farmers, rural wage workers, indigenous
       peoples and ethnical communities. To measure the completion progress in this goal, an
       Annual Report on Land Tenure Security (ISTT) will be developed and released as
       appropriate.

       Increase the national productive capacity by upgrading and expanding electricity
       generation to cut down power outages and shift the power matrix inthe mediumterm to
       renewable sources of power inmediumterm by streamlining red-tapeprocedures to grant
       power generation licenses infavor of new electricity license holders who would increase
       the renewable energy-basedcapacity.


    0   Promote access to financial services under conditions fostering inclusive economic
        development. Therefore, we are establishing a Guarantee Fund to provide over 56,420
        users with loan services in2008, comparedwith 36,000 users benefitedfrom Usura Cero,
        PRORURAL and SMEs Development programs. Regarding this topic, the GRNU plans
        to decrease poverty by increasing SMEs competitiveness to enter domestic and
        international markets.


    0   Another important part of the inclusive economic development refers to the increased
        national productive capacity by improving the road infrastructure nationwide. In this
        sense, we are furthering the Road Maintenance Fund (FOMAV) by enforcing the
        mandatory taxes, as to support in the medium term (2010) 5,600 kilometers in
        comparison with 2,765 kilometers rehabilitated in2007


IV.     IMPROVEGOVERNANCEAND JUSTICE

The core elements of this goal are Justice, Women's Rights, Ethics and Transparency inPublic
Management, Freedom of Public Information, and Access to the Land. However, rather thanthe
GRNU, the Judiciary is directly responsiblefor the former. The Judiciary is willing to strengthen
the self-determination andfairness ofthe administration ofjustice andwomen's access tojustice.
They will monitor the percentage of judicial officials who have been selected on the basis of
individual merits or competitive examination out of the total numbers of officials appointed in
accordance with the Judiciary Administration Law and/or relevant regulation. This percentage
would reach 80% by late 2008.

Interms ofwomen's rights, the GRNUispromoting and highlightingwomen's involvement and
leadership in all aspects and this Administration is endeavoring in safeguardingwomen's rights.
Hambre Cero program aims largely women to empower and turn women into economic agents.
It is expected to benefit over 14,000 in 2008 if compared to 4000 women in 2007. Efforts are




                                                61

being made indeveloping and promoting the National Gender Policy, including relevant follow-
upmechanism.

Ethics and Transparency in Public Management as well the Freedom of Public Information are
priorities for this Government. We are engaged in developing and implementing an Anti
Corruption Strategy and the National Transparency Plan. Regarding the Freedom of Public
Information, the President's Office has issued an executive order to all state ministries to
establish Public InformationOffices in conformity with the Freedom of Public Information Act
No621 passed on May 16* 2007 and its regulations passed this gthday of January 2008. Our
short-term goal is to have at least five public informationoffices working inaccordancewith the
Article 20 of the Freedomof Public InformationAct No621,so the offices render their first 2008
report. Opening public informationoffices inmajor state ministries and other public agencies i s a
medium-termgoal, whereby by late 2010 at least 15 state institutions should be equipped with
public information offices, in compliance with the Article 20 of the Freedom of Public
InformationAct.

The issue of property and access to the land tenure is another critical matter to be solved. A
cadastral survey is on progress to regulate property. Efforts are being made to strengthen
SIICAR and concurrently maintain and improvelegal security.


Final Considerations

All these short and medium term actions are to accomplish a steady economic growth, a
sustainable development, and a decreased poverty level, within a macroeconomic framework
managed conscientiously and the implementation of public policies needed to fulfill the
Millennium Development Goals as well the Human Development Targets underscored in this
letter. The World Bank support translated into a Development Policy Loan becomes critical to
ensure these objectives. Therefore, the Government of Reconciliation and National Unity
(GNU) is herebyapplying for andrequesting the approval of saidloan.

Development        The main determinants o f growth in Nicaragua are public infrastructure
Policy Review      development, education attainment, financial sector deepening and
                   improved governance. The main recommendations within each sector
ReportNo 23095-NI
(7 December2001)   are presented below:

                   1. Improve public infrastructure services in (1) transport, by expanding
                   the paved road network, better road maintenance and sector institutional
                   strengthening, and in (ii)    energy, by expanding rural electrification, the
                   regulatory framework and promoting private sector participation and
                   diversifyingenergy sources.

                   2. Improve education achievement by increasing school coverage above
                   4' grade, access to pre-school and teacher quality, among other, through         No. 3
                   accelerated implementation o f the school autonomy program and
                   achievement testing.

                   3. Strengthen the financial system through the maintenance o f a sound
                   fiscal framework, depoliticizing the judiciary and strengthening creditor
                   rights, developing the sector legal and institutional framework (e.g.,
                   property registries, commercial code, pledges over assets), reducing the
                   burdeno ftaxation on financial intermediation and strengthening banking
                   sector regulation and supervision.

                   4. Improve governance through the implementation o f the civil service
                   law, the CFAA action planto improve public financial management, the            NOS. 1-2
                   CPAR action planto modernize public procurementand a comprehensive
                   reform programto reduce administrative barriers.

Public              Several important vulnerabilities, if not properly addressed, could
Expenditure         undermine fiscal discipline. These include: (i) growth in current
                                                                         the
Review              transfers (reflecting increased fiscal transfers to the municipalities
                    mandated by Law 466); (ii)the growth in public wages, which is
ReportNo.39807-Nl   sustainable only with rapid productivity growth; (iii) actuarial deficit
                                                                            the
(19 June2007)       o f the pension system; and (iv) a looming energy crisis. To address
                    these challenges, the PER draws attention to the needto,
                    0   develop a political consensus on a decentralization strategy that
                        results inmore explicit linkage between central government transfers
                        and expenditure responsibilities of municipalities,
                        develop and adopt appropriate framework legislation for a public            No. 1

                        sector remunerationpolicy,
                        encourage more investment in the energy sector by creating a more
                        stable policy environment for private investors, and
                    0   introduce pension reforms over the medium term to reduce the
                        actuarial deficit to a fiscally sustainable level

                    The total amount o f public infrastructure and social spending inNicaragua
                    appears to be adequate given the country's economic capacity, but there is    NOS. 6
                                                                                                       3 -

Governance           telecommunications sector, but faces serious difficulties in the
Review               electricity sector, andwas weak inthe water and sanitation sector.

ReportNo.39817-h!I   2. Progress needs to be made to ensure the independence and
                     professionalismofregulatory institutions.

                     3. The approval of the draft Law on Public Registries, which has been
                     under congressional review for a few years, would make the registry
                     system more reliable.

                     4. The State has not, to date, beenable to recuperateany resources as a
                     result of its investigations due to the lack of follow up in the judicial
                     system.

                     5. The Comptroller's Office needs to allocate adequate financial and         No. 2
                     humanresources to undertakethis annually.

                     6. The recent approval of the Freedom of Access to Public Information

Economic performance has weakened due to a more challenging external environment.
Economic activity has slowed, reflecting a further rise in oil prices and declining U.S. growth,
and real GDP growth is now projected at 34percent in 2008. Headline inflation jumped to
23.6 percent in July, owing mainly to the increase in commodity prices, and core inflation has
also beenrising due to second-round effects. The current account deficit has widened, reflecting
higher oil prices and imports, partly offset by buoyant export growth. The deficit i s financed
through FDI and official aid, however, and gross international reserves exceeded U S $ l.lbillion
in August (3%months of imports), up about US$80 million over the past 12 months. Fiscal
outcomes for 2007 exceeded program targets-an overall consolidated public sector surplus of
0.9 percent of GDP compared with a deficit of 1 percent of GDP-due mainly to delays in the
execution of investmentspending.

However, macro policies have remained prudent, and performance under the PRGF-
supported programhas been broadlysatisfactory.All quantitative performance criteria (PCs)
through end-2007 were met with large margins. Available data through end-June indicate that
most quantitative PCs were also met, except for a small shortfall in NIR accumulation, which
however followed a much larger-than-programmed accumulation during 2007. The structural
reform agenda has also beenimplemented, albeit with some delays, including a budget for 2008
consistent with the program; increases in electricity tariffs; legislation discouraging electricity
theft; and an action plan to revamp public financial management practices. Completion of the
review was delayed following the suspension of debt service on public bonds (CENIs)during a
legal investigation, potentially risking two major banks to become severely undercapitalized,
with significant implications for financial stability. Restructuring agreements were reached in
June/July, and a bond swap was implementedinAugust.

The authorities' revised program for 2008 reflects their continued commitment to sound
policies. The 2008 fiscal stance remains unchanged, but the 2009 fiscal program envisages a
slower pace of consolidation to help protect vulnerable groups from the commodity price shock.
While measures to boost food production should help to reduce inflation over the mediumterm,
monetary policy will needto remain vigilant, and continued resistance to wage pressures will be
key to avoid a wage-price spiral. Electricity sector reforms will be sustainedby keeping tariffs in
line with costs and enforcing the new anti-theft legislation. Inthe financial sector, the authorities
intendto move quickly to re-establish the central bank board-presently      without a quorum-to
restore the institutional framework for monetary policy and provide the CENI restructuring
agreements with a legal basis. Also, the Superintendency will ensure banks comply over an
agreed period with prudential norms and improved accounting standards. The authorities also

                                                73

intendto strengthen aid monitoring and transparency, including by publishing a biannual report
on the sources and uses of all official aid inflows.

Against this background, staff is recommendingapproval of the first review and a small
augmentationunder the Poverty Reductionand GrowthFacility (PRGF), to helpNicaragua
cope with the negative impact of last year's natural disasters. An Executive Board meeting has
beenscheduledfor September 10.
