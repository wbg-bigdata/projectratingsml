A: Program Purpose and Project Development Objective
The Latvia Health Reform Program seeks to support the Government of Latvia to implement a
long-term health services restructuring strategy. It is based on the agreed Government Letter of
Development Program addressing key health policy issues (see Annex 3). An Adaptable Program Loan
(APL) is perceived to be the appropriate instrument to use for this rapidly developing transition economy
since it provides flexibility on one hand and assures consistency of policies on the other.
The purpose of the program is to achieve a sustainable performance-oriented health system where
health care providers are rewarded for quality and efficiency; each patient has his/her own primary health
care doctor of his/her choice; health insurance coverage ensures access to affordable and effective health
care; and continuous progress is made with regard to priority health status targets. Progress towards this
purpose will contribute to the improved welfare of the Latvia population as measured by gains in health
status and public satisfaction with the national health system.
The development objective for Phase I of the APL (current project) is to create a framework for a
modem and effective health care system, including policy reforms, institution building and skills
development for the health financing system, health investment policy, primary health care reform,
hospital restructuring and effective public health programs. Phase II would provide support to a
Consolidated Health Investment Program (CHIP) to directly support investments into health service
restructuring. The summary of Phase I and II of the Health Reform Program is in Annex 1, Attachment
1.

1. Key Performance Indicators:
The following indicators will be used to measure the achievement of the program purpose.
Progress towards these indicators will be monitored during the implementation of both phases of the
program.
* All acute medical and surgical admissions treated in multispecialty hospitals.
* Overall acute (multispecialty) hospital bed to population ratio no more than 5 per 1,000.
* 75 percent of hospital admissions referred by General Practitioners by 2005.
* 80 percent of the population is served by newly qualified general practitioners financed
through capitated primary health care contracts by 2005.
* Selected proxy indicators for health behavior improved by 2005.
* Proportion of population reporting restricted access to health services because of financial
and/or geographical reasons reduced to 5 percent by 2005.
Trigger indicators for Phase II measure progress during Phase I towards policy objectives. They
will be assessed as part of monitoring and evaluation arrangements for Phase I of the project. Trigger
indicators are described in Attachment 2 to Annex 1.

B: Strategic Context
1. Sector-related Country Assistance Strategy (CAS) goal supported by the project (see Annex 1):
The current CAS was discussed by the Board on May 19, 1998 (Report No. 17706LV). The
CAS outlines five areas for Bank support to Latvia: economic management; private sector development;
support to reshape the State's role; development of sub-national government capacity; and provision of
improved social services, including health care. An improved health care system will be a means to
improve the welfare of the Latvian people through improved health status and satisfaction with the
national health care system.
2. Main sector issues and Government strategy:
Latvia is a small, urbanized country (69 percent) with a population of 2.5 million (1997) located
in the middle of the three Baltic States. After high inflation and sharp declines in income and social
indicators during the initial years of independence (1991), the economy has stabilized and growth has
resumed. Latvia is implementing reforms for transition to a market economy and membership in the
European Union (EU) (see Annex 11).
Main health sector issues are common with other CEE/FSU countries. Aggregate health
indicators have deteriorated compared to the pre-transition period (pre- 1991), leaving Latvia with a
significant gap in health status in comparison with the EU countries Latvia wants to join. The health
system does not proactively address the root causes of ill health because of a lack of effective public
health policies and programs. The health system is also not able to reactively cope with the increased
burden of ill health because of an inefficient health care delivery and health financing system. Declining
public funding for health services and lack of maintenance of and investments into health care
infrastructure exacerbates the situation.

has been negative since 1991, because of       1990      1.60       4.91       47.14

women. Contributing factors to this negative
trend that has severely affected the working age population (Table 2) are deteriorating socio-economic
conditions during transition, behavioral health determinants of immediate impact (alcohol related injuries,
poisonings, suicides), and increased mortality from health conditions amenable to health care
interventions (perinatal mortality, CVD mortality, TB)2
Birth rate per 1,000 population declined from 13.0 in 1991 to 7.9 1996; mortality increased from 13.1 to peak
16.4 in 1994 and subsiding to 13.8 in 1996,

capacity and leadership to
comprehensively address the above root causes of non-communicable disease mortality. Effective health
protection measures such as substantial increase of tobacco price or removing subsidies from high fat
content food products are not being implemented. In 1998, specific excise duty on cigarettes translated to
LVL 0.08 (US$0.14) per pack of cigarettes. Overall tax content of retail price of most popular cigarette
brands of LVL 0.6 (US$1 equivalent) was about 28 percent which is far below EU recommended 50
percent and does not create significant price barriers for tobacco consumption. There is also lack of
effective health promotion programs and a lack of clearly defined targets to measure Latvia's progress in
improving on major CVD risk factors.

substantial rationalization of specialized hospital capacity.6

An inefficient health care delivery system could be characterized by excessive, poorly organized,
low quality hospital infrastructure as well as a poorly distributed mix of human resource skills (too many
specialist physicians, too few skilled nurses and managers). Structural inheritance from the Soviet health
system, an inappropriate policy framework and low institutional capacity are contributing factors to
inefficiency. Although the number of hospital beds has declined over the past few years and hospital
production shows efficiency gains, the main efficiency indicators remain below international benchmarks
(Table 5). Single specialty and small hospitals still make up quite a significant share of inpatient capacity
(0.8 and 0.7 per 1,000 population respectively) hindering economies of scale. Estimates about remaining
excess capacity in hospitals vary from 11,000 to 15,000 beds (40-55 percent). In 1998, 1.5 percent of
hospital beds were in the private sector.7 Ineffective primary health care was a by-product of and has
now become a concomitant cause of this hospital oriented health care system.

Inefficient management of health expenditures. Latvia has taken considerable steps in reforming
the health financing system towards clear separation of purchasing and provision of health services and
increased autonomy and pluralistic ownership of health care providers. As of January 1, 1998, 33 local
sickness funds began the process of merging into eight Regional Sickness Funds (minimum 200,000
population coverage). By design they are expected to correct for earlier problems of inefficient risk
management and administration, regional inequities in per capita health spending and incomplete
separation of purchasing and provision functions at the municipal level. However, several inefficiencies
persist: (a) public finances for health services are channeled through two separately managed programs
("multiple pipes"); (b) there is an inappropriate provider payment methodology; and (c) investment
expenditures are managed inefficiently.
Multiple pipes. Currently, public funds flow through two separately managed programs. The
income tax-financed Basic Program (about 50 percent of total public health expenditures in 1997) is
managed by new regional funds; the budget financed State Program (including specialized and tertiary
health care services) is managed partly by the MOW and partly by the State Compulsory Health
Insurance Central Fund (SCHICF). This arrangement has allowed several inefficiencies to persist: (i)
expensive specialized health services have been protected from financial pressures to restructure; (ii) has
enabled uncoordinated financial flows to these providers as they also provided Basic Program services to
regional Sickness Funds; (iii) created regional inequities about access to tertiary care as State Program
was not population based thus favoring inhabitants of few big urban centers. A comprehensive,
predominantly "single pipe" public health financing system would improve efficiency of public
expenditure.

The current provider payment methodology provides few incentives for efficiency improvements:
(i) Government run tertiary care hospitals are still financed based on inputs such as personnel, beds, etc.;
(ii) Basic Program hospital services are financed by bed-day and specialist outpatient services by fee-for-
service thus creating incentives to increase volume; (iii) prohibitive costs of outpatient drugs make
patients seek inpatient care and contribute to a potential equity problem of 25-fold difference in private
spending between the lowest and highest income population deciles (see Figure 2).

Inefficient management of investment expenditure. Financial flows for maintenance of capital
stock and regular re-investment were hit harder than overall funding for health services. In 1994
investment expenditures were at 1/10 of the 1990 level which is not sustainable over the long termn. A
decrease in separate investment revenue stream has partly been compensated by decentralizing decision
making and liberalizing the use of operational revenue by hospital managers. However, the Government
strategy to control cost-escalation by reducing reimbursement unit value has led to unsustainable
provision of services at the expense running down the capital. Today, public investment program
decisions are made without clear criteria and not linked to operating expenditures. There are under-
investments in some sub-sectors that could contribute to improved efficiency and quality of health system
through modern technologies. Roles for regulation and investment functions in decentralized settings are
not defined: (i) there is uncertain legal and regulatory framework governing health providers' access to
capital; (ii) there is fragmentation and lack of uniformity of approach to investment project design,
appraisal and approval; (iii) there is fragmentation and lack of capacity to monitor incidence, progress
and success of investment projects; (iv) there is lack of clarity concerning investment under current
provider payment mechanisms. Efficiency and affordability of overall health sector investment program
would greatly benefit from integrated management of donor, commercial and public investments.
Budget allocation lacks stability, transparency and predictability. The impact of inefficiencies in
the health care delivery system and the difficult process of reforming the system have been aggravated by
macro-economic instability of real decline in economic growth during the early 1990s (Figure 1).
Although the economy turned around in 1996 and grew by 6 percent in 1997 with continued growth
expected to be sustained in the medium term, public spending on health is forecasted to decrease further
as share of GDP (See Table 6). The overall health expenditure (private and public) amounted to 6.1
percent of GDP in 1996. This is a comparable indicator for similar economies. But there is need for a
more transparent and predictable base for budget allocation for health to allow for longer term planning



Page 7
and reduced scope of political interference. Currently the sources of public health spending consist of a
predictable 28.4 percent earmark on income tax and a somewhat uncertain allocation from general budget
revenue. Development of a modem "technical" basis for budget allocation that is consistent with
ongoing health financing reform would give the system stability to plan for restructuring in the medium
and long term.
Declining public funding on health is being compensated by increasing private expenditures:
estimated Ls 22.6 per capita (US$38 equivalent) in 1996, a significant 33 percent of overall health
expenditures. Direct household expenditures on health care included co-payments (15-25 percent of
service price), outpatient drugs (mainly non-subsidized), public and private services not covered by
Sickness Funds and to a lesser extent, for private services as an alternative to public services. There are
considerable differences in private spending between high and low income groups possibly indicating
access problems, in particular to outpatient drugs (Figure 2). The IFC8 estimates that the potential
demand for fully private health care provision and insurance would be one to four percent of the total
population (25,000 - 100,000 people) but they would be younger and healthier than the population on
average.
Weak institutional capacity and a vaguely defined institutional framework hinders
implementation of the new health financing principles. The proposed purchaser/provider split has created
needs for new institutions, new roles and responsibilities, clear by-laws and transparent administrative
procedures, new accountability mechanisms, new skills for health insurance and business-like hospital
management, and appropriate management information systems. Options for incorporation of public
agencies have been limited to publicly held not-for-profit joint stock and limited liability companies.
Whereas respective regulations provide for substantial autonomy and flexibility, they do not provide
assurances for clear public accountability. Success and credibility of the reform depends on the
appropriate response to such institutional needs and the appropriate legal status for organizations
involved.
The Government strategy to address the main sector issues is defined in: (i) "Strategy for
Health Care Development in Latvia" adopted by the Cabinet of Ministers on September 24, 1996; and in
(ii) Government regulations on implementing health reforms passed during 1997, including Health Care
Law, Physicians Practice Law and a number of Cabinet health financing regulations.
The Government health strategy to tackle deteriorating health indicators emphasizes programs
and initiatives to promote healthy behavior, to decrease tobacco, alcohol consumption and drug-abuse; to
improve maternal and child health; to improve mental health; and to improve reproductive health
education. This would be achieved through establishing a credible baseline of the prevalence of main
indicators and risk factors in the relevant areas and implementing effective health protection measures
and health promotions programs. The Government also plans to reorganize its environmental health
program, including, a number of inter-sectoral initiatives for compatibility with EU standards. In order
to harmonize the excise tax system with EU requirements, the Government plans to adopt new laws on
excise tax for tobacco products and alcoholic beverages, including raising respective taxes to be more in
line with EU requirements. Currently, only socio-economic factors, not public health arguments are
considered in determining the rate for tax increases.
The Government strategy to improve efficiency is to rationalize secondary and tertiary health
care services supplied through a mix of regulated market and planning measures: (i) create appropriate
a Baltics Health Care Sector Study. Draft, 1998. International Finance Corporation. Project Files.

incentives through contract improvements and the introduction of a PVQ and DRG9-based hospital
reimbursement system; (ii) develop restructuring plans for regional health systems with participation of
RSFs as long term funders/purchasers of services, local governments as owners of hospitals and hospital
management; (iii) establish a general practitioner-based primary health care model as a gatekeeper to
secondary care services.10 The Latvia Development Strategy for the Secondary Health Care System
proposes that state hospitals will be consolidated through developing multi-specialty hospitals; closing or
transforming small hospitals into nursing care hospitals, PHC centers or social care institutions;
transforming single specialty hospitals into long-stay hospitals by moving current services to
multispecialty hospitals or outpatient settings.
The Government strategy to improve certainty and stability of health financing is to establish
targets for total health expenditures and state budget allocation for the health insurance budget see (Table
6). For FY99, total expenditures for health (exclusive of World Bank loan financing and patient fees) will
increase by 17 percent in nominal terms over the 1998 expenditures. For FY 2000-2001, the State basic
budget financing for health services (exclusive of patient fees) will be not less than 10 percent of state
basic budget revenue with investment financing included in the special health insurance budget.
Throughout the period 1999-2001, the Borrower will ensure that the earmark of the income tax revenue
for health care services remains not less than 28.4 percent of total revenues.

To improve the efficiency of financial flows in the health sector the Government will gradually
consolidate public health funds into "single pipe" to be allocated to sickness funds based on risk adjusted
capitation formula. The target is to reach 90 percent "single pipe financing" by FY 2000 (see Table 6).

funds. The Government has already consolidated 33 local sickness funds into 8 regional sickness funds
(RSFs) (see map and Table 7). This arrangement provides opportunity for effective purchasing of health
services and regional health services planning. Transactions between the SCHICF and regional funds and
between regional funds and providers are regulated by standard contracts. The Government plans to
strengthen SCHICF and RSF institutions to enable more effective management of the new planning and
purchasing functions. To contain public expenditures at a sustainable level, the health financing
regulations also define a system of co-payments and a negative list of entitlements.

publicly funded but privately provided services. Private co-payments are being restructured: a 15
percent across-the-board co-payment with an objective to raise additional revenue has been replaced by a
flat co-payment system with annual and per admission ceilings. This will still reduce the moral hazard
problem and increase personal responsibility for health but at the same time it will not restrict access for
poor and chronically ill patients. In addition, the reimbursement system for outpatient drugs needs to be
extended and restructured to reduce incentives that have increased the demand for inpatient care, and to
reduce inequities in access to essential drugs.
The Government has recognized that understanding and acceptance of health care reforms by the
general public as well as by the key stakeholders is critical for successful implementation of change.
The Ministry of Welfare has established a Public Relations Unit to improve the Government
communications function. Plans have been developed for institutional strengthening of the unit and
implementation of sustainable communication activities.
3. Sector issues to be addressed by the project and strategic choices:
Deteriorating    Much of the causality of declining health status is beyond the reach of the health care
health          system. However, the health care system can have an impact on health conditions
indicators     that are directly amenable to health care interventions, such as perinatal mortality,
secondary prevention of CVDs, TB, emergency care for injuries and acute health
conditions. The health care system can also play a leadership role in primary
prevention of ill health through a well defined inter-sectoral public health strategy,
adequate surveillance, operational research, promoting legislation with positive public
health externalities and commissioning/implementing effective health promotion
programs. The current project focuses on general practitioner based primary health
care reform as a professional conduit of effective secondary prevention programs and
developing institutional capacity for modern public health interventions.
Lack of         To operationalize capacity to develop and implement effective public health policies

strategy with priorities and measurable targets; and (iv) a sustainable financing
mechanism. To increase the rate of excise tax increase on tobacco and alcohol

products, the public health argument for reducing consumption through considerable
price increases needs to be considered and supported by credible operational research.
This diagnosis and proposed intervention under the current project are in line with
WHO analysis and recommendations. I 1 Progress in key components of effective
public health policy is measured by selected trigger indicators.
Inefficient     Excess hospital capacity is the most salient feature of this issue. An enabling
health care     environment needs to be created for the successful rationalization of hospital capacity
delivery system  including: appropriate financial incentives of at least medium term certainty; feasible
basis and institutional capacity for health services master plans development; clarity
of roles and responsibilities between management and owners of hospitals;
development of new evaluative functions (e.g. technology assessment); viable
alternatives for hospital care and strategies and activity programs to engage
stakeholders in achieving political consensus on hospital rationalization. It was
recognized through policy dialogue, informal sector work and project preparation
activities12 that such an enabling environment does not exist in Latvia. Key strategic
decisions about developing such an environment were made based on best
international practice and Latvian political context and they include developing
regional health services master plans in collaboration with the regional health services
funders (regional sickness funds), developing general practitioner-based primary
health care system as an alternative to hospital care, and establishing a Technology
Assessment function linked to the health financing administration. The second phase
would directly support restructuring efforts.
Inefficient     Through policy dialogue under the SAL, Latvia has taken several steps to improve
management of  management of health care expenditures, e.g. introducing purchaser/provider split and
health          perfornmance based payment methods, consolidation of 33 local health insurance
expenditures    funds into 8 regional funds. Outstanding issues include fragmentation of public
health expenditures between two separate programs, inadequate contracts and
underdeveloped medium and long term strategy for public/private mix, and little
institutional capacity to fully implement reform. Strategic choices related to the
current project include establishing a feasible scope for the "single pipe" funding
mechanism (what proportion and by when); selecting health care provider payment
methods and continuing to improve quality of contracts; reviewing the public benefits
package to ensure access to services for the vulnerable and to maintain appropriate
incentives. The "single pipe" mechanism is highlighted as the most important policy
measure to be monitored through the initial loan condition and trigger indicators for
the APL second phase. Other strategic issues, including institution building and
development of policy tools, are more process oriented and continuous progress will
be monitored through normal project monitoring mechanisms. Appropriate outcome
of policy development will be a precondition for the second phase of the APL.
Lack of         The Government is looking for several options to improve the technical basis for state
stability,      budget allocation for health. Strategic choices included, a matching grant to the
transparency    earmarked portion of income tax or allocation based on needs of the uninsured
and             (legitimately non-contributing population). The former would be administratively
predictability of simpler but politically more contentious. The latter is administratively more complex,

change          publicly owned, not-for-profit joint-stock company; municipal limited liability

option will have to secure protection of public interest and clear accountability as well
as be feasible for performing technical functions. The appropriate legal status of
SCHICF and hospitals will be developed during the first phase of APL.

Description of Project Components:
A. Implementatiion of Health Care Financing Reforms. The project would support
implementation of the health financing policy framework as defined in the Government reform program:
improve effectiveness of budget process, develop payment models for health care providers and
contracting system, strengthen institutional capacity of health insurance funds by providing training in
general management as well as in technical functions of health insurance, develop medical and financial
audit capacity, develop client relations, provide appropriate premises and establish an initial country-wide
health financing management information system. The counterparts for this component are State
Compulsory Health Insurance Central Fund, Department of Budget and Finance of MOW and regional
sickness funds.
The project will finance foreign and local technical assistance, seminars and short term study
tours to learn from relevant international experience, civil works, office equipment and furniture,
computer hard and software including application software development, publication of information
materials, television and radio broadcasts, and client surveys.
B. Development and Restructuring of Health Care Services. The project would support the
MOW to develop a consolidated health investment and capital financing policy; develop effective
capability in the MOW, SCHICF and RSFs to undertake health service planning, set investment priorities
and monitor the investment program; develop health technology assessment capacity in the Health
Statistics and Medical Technologies Agency; develop an agreed methodology and training in investment
project appraisal; support development of regional and national health services master plans, an
associated Consolidated H[ealth Investment Program and capital financing plan; support a pilot hospital
restructuring project; develop a standard legal framework for public hospitals; train hospital managers;
develop capacity for training and retraining of primary health care providers and support pilot PHC
projects; develop capacity for surveillance of non-communicable diseases and related risk factors, support
operational public health research, developing a national public health report and priorities; and support
pilot health promotion and disease prevention programs. The counterparts of this component are the
Ministry of Welfare, SCHICF and regional sickness funds, Latgale Sickness Funds Region, the Health
Statistics and Medical Technologies Agency, the Medical Academy, and the Center of Professional
Medical Education.
Under this component, the project will finance foreign and local technical assistance, fellowships,
seminars and study tours, relevant literature, computer hard- and software, civil works, medical
equipment, publications, training equipment and supplies, selected health promotion programs and
incremental recurrent costs during the life of the project.
Phase II will support major restructuring across Latvia through implementation of regional health
care plans and the roll-out of PHC reforms, continued development of management capacity in the
hospital sector and development of a framework for periodic updating of regional and national health care
plans.
C. Implementation of Health Reform Communications Strategy. The project would
strengthen the capacity of the MOW to design and implement health policy communication strategies.
The counterpart for this component is the Public Relations Unit of the Ministry of Welfare.
The project will finance local and foreign technical assistance, study tours, seminars, print
materials, TV and radio spots, public opinion surveys and incremental recurrent costs of campaign
management. Public health awareness will be incorporated into these spots.



Page 13
D. Project Management. To ensure effective management and timely implementation of the
project, support would be provided to strengthen the PCU of the MOW which now manages the Welfare
Reform Project. This component will also support development of the Project Implementation Plan for
the Phase II of the APL.
2. Key policy and institutional reforms supported by the project:
The Government is expected to undertake the following policy interventions:
A. Health financing reform.
*  Consolidate public health funding into a "single pipe" channeled through SCHICF and RSFs
based on a risk-adjusted regional capitation formula. A larger size risk pool (minimum 200,000
people) will allow for efficient administration and adequate risk management for most health
problems. The target for the year 2000 is 90 percent "single pipe" financing. [A trigger indicator
for Phase II of the APL.]
*  Develop health care provider payment methodologies: a DRG and global budgeting for hospital
care and capitated methodology for primary health care providers. [A trigger indicator for Phase
II of the APL.]
*  Implement health care provider payment methodologies: a DRG and global budgeting for
hospital care and a capitated methodology for primary health care providers. [During Phase II of
the APL.]
*  Pass regulations defining the legal status of hospitals, the institution of general practitioner, and
health insurance funds. These regulations should define the property rights, autonomy and
accountability of management, and the rights and obligations of owners and managers of health
care institutions. [A trigger indicator for Phase II of the APL.]
*  Revise health care investment and capital financing policy and develop a consolidated health
investment program.
B. Health system restructuring.
*  Develop national and regional master plans for reconfiguration and rationalization of hospital
capacity.
*  Develop policies and regulations to support effective implementation of General Practitioner-
based PHC system.
*  Develop sustainable primary health care providers (re)training capacity.
*  Gradually introduce General Practitioner gate-keeping role.
*  Pilot effective coordination between PHC and social services.
C. Public health reform.
* Establish national public health priorities and targets. [A trigger indicator for Phase II.]
*  Improve monitoring of the population's health status and major risk factors; establish a health
behavior surveillance system; and plan and complete a comprehensive health survey every four
to five years.
*  Gradually increase tobacco excise tax to those comparable to EU levels. [A trigger indicator for
Phase 11.]
*  Improve health promotion infrastructure and human resources.
* Improve non-governmental organization advocacy activities.

4. Institutional and implementation arrangements:
The Project would be implemented over two years through the Ministry of Welfare, utilizing the
already-existing administrative structure of the Project Coordination Unit (PCU) established in 1996 for
the Welfare Reform Project. The PCU Director reports directly to the Minister of Welfare. A Health
Project Coordinator was appointed during preparation and would work in parallel with the Social Welfare
Project Coordinator. The Health Project Coordinator is directly accountable to a Project Director who.
oversees the work of the PCU and overall project implementation. The Project Steering Committee
would provide oversight and policy guidance during the project implementation. The PCU is already
staffed with experienced procurement and financial officers, and will continue to function throughout the
completion of the Program as proposed for 2004.
During project preparation, the component working groups representing various stakeholders
prepared project activities. A Project Steering Committee chaired by the State Minister of Health, acted
as the main decision-making body for the program and project design. During implementation, entities
targeted with the project will be responsible for project implementation as outlined below and in the
Project Implementation Plan (PIP). Each implementing entity, line department, or authority will be
responsible for appointing a component or activity coordinator who would work closely with the PCU in
overseeing implementation:
(i) Project Director: Under-Secretary of State for Health: Chief executive overseeing project
implementation and achievement of the project's development objectives;
(ii) Project Coordination Unit (PCU): Monitor progress in achievement of project outcomes
through project monitoring indicators; conduct procurement; maintain project accounts and
records; liaise with project entities, donors, and the Bank; host an Annual Implementation
Review as the basis for approving annual Health Investment Programs; administer the use
of Loan and SIDA funds; oversee technical assistance;
(iii) State Compulsory Health Insurance Central Fund (SC:HCF) Oversee implementation of
Component A. Implementation of Health Financing Reforms. For this purpose the SCHICF
will maintain a Working Group, retain MIS manager and MIS Specification Team;
(iv) MOW Budget and Finance Department: Oversee implementation of Component B 1.
Investment Policy Development;
(v) MOW Health Department: Oversee implementation of the Components B.2 Support to PHC
Reforms and B.3 Support to Hospital Restructuring Program;
(vi) MOW Public Health Department: Oversee implementation of Component B4: Support to
Public Health Reform;
(vii) MOW Public Relations Unit: Oversee implementation of Component C: Implementation of
Health Reform Information and Communications Strategy.
Donor Coordination: The PCU would work closely with the Investments and Credit Policy Unit
in the Department of Budget and Finance of the MOW which is responsible for coordinating the
participation of other donors. SIDA provided significant technical assistance in the development of a
regulatory framework of the operation of central and regional insurance funds and will continue to take a
lead role during project implementation through the provision of parallel financing for this component
(SIDA Grant of US$2.0 Million). The SIDA Grant would also be administered by the PCU.
Monitoring and Evaluation: The PCU will: (i) be responsible for collecting data and closely
monitoring the implementation of all project activities according to agreed monitoring indicators; (ii)
liaise with the respective implementing entities to ensure performance indicators are being collected and
monitored; (iii) monitor performance and assess progress in achieving the Project and Program
Development Objectives and specific Outputs. (Project and Program Monitoring Indicators and Phase II



Page 16
Indicators).
Annual Implementation Review: The PCU would prepare and organize an annual
implementation review on progress towards policy objectives as well as on project implementation
progress. Three reviews would be held during the two and a half year project: (i) project appraisal and
negotiations in September/October 1998; (ii) about one year from the date of effectiveness,
approximately January 2000; and (iii) evaluation of trigger indicators in June 2000. A comprehensive
final evaluation would be carried out at the completion of the project as part of the Implementation
Completion Report (ICR).
Progress Reporting: Semester progress reports for the Project will be prepared by the PCU
according to an agreed format, and will be based on the contribution of individual reports prepared by
Component or Activity coordinators. Semester Progress Reports will become due August 31 and
February 15 for the preceding semester period. Agreed Progress Reports will include a format for
reporting on benchmarks and monitoring indicators.
Accounting, Financial Reporting, and Auditing: The existing Welfare Reform PCU has a
financial management system in place to record and report all assets and liabilities and financial actions
of the project. Health project management will be integrated with the existing PCU. Separate accounts
will be maintained for the Health Project for all project components according to internationally accepted
accounting standards. Supporting documentation for SOE expenditures will be maintained separately by
Withdrawal Application and will be made available to Bank officials for review. Financial reports will be
included in Semester Progress Reports. Annual independent project audits will be carried out by
independent auditors acceptable to the Bank under agreed terms of reference. Audit reports will be
submitted to the Bank within six months of the completion of the Government's fiscal year.
D: Project Rationale
1. Project alternatives considered and reasons for rejection:
No-project altermative. The perceived value added of the project is to support the Government to
leverage policy reform. Given that political will exists, resources are needed to secure some critical
inputs, produce successful pilots to secure positive feedback on reform, and ensure stakeholder
engagement and approval. Post-socialist transition economies do not have a tradition of adequately
financing reform efforts which is further exacerbated by the high opportunity cost of recurrent
expenditure dollars. Well designed project funds would mitigate the risk of loosing commitment and
credibility of the reform compared with no-project alternative.
Bank loan instrument. Standard sector investment loan and adaptable program instruments were
considered. The context for the selection of a loan instrument is set by the need to assure consistency of
the general direction of the reform program across several elections cycles and the need for flexibility to
adapt to a rapidly developing transition economy environment and likely need for some adjustments.
Such a context calls for a phased approach. A standard investment loan would fail in the short term, it
lacks of flexibility, and there are few opportunities to maintain policy dialogue and leverage. An ideal
instrument would fall between the standard sector investment loan and adjustment loan for which
Adaptable Lending Program is perceived to be the best fit.
Size of the loan. Latvia has been a very conservative borrower, the Government debt in 1996
was 8 percent of GDP. The size of the operation was influenced by what is acceptable to the Government
and yet still sufficient to leverage policy changes. Annual project disbursements amounting to about



Page 17
three percent of the overall annual health spending were perceived to be affordable to the Government
and sufficient to support the policy program.
Specific design issues. The design of the project was based on a productive and cooperative
relationship with the Government of Latvia facilitated by policy dialogue under the Structural Adjustment
Lending process. The discussion of alternatives for the project design is linked to discussion of
alternatives for the key policy decisions as described above (Section B.3).
2. Major related projects financed by the Bank and/or other development agencies (completed,

3. Lessons learned and reflected in the project design:
Lessons learned from other health projects in the ECA region are as follows:13 (a) health sector
reform is a lengthy, politicized process and expectations for the reform process have been too optimistic
for both the World Bank and the client countries; (b) institutional aspects of reform are as important as
technically proficient strategies; (c) greater attention needs to be paid to the political economy of the
reform through marketing reforms to lawmakers, the medical community and the public; (d) projects
have been too complex; and (e) adequate resources need to be committed for supervision of projects.
The current project emphasizes capacity building and developing an adequate communications
strategy. An APL is expected to allow for management of complex policy issues through a phased
approach allowing for less complex design for each phase and better monitoring of progress. The
political dimension of the reform was explicitly raised and analyzed using Computer Assisted Policy
Analysis.14 This analysis enabled the mapping of all relevant stakeholders and their positions with
regard to reform, the design of reform communication and stakeholder involvement strategies as part of
the project to mitigate adverse political outcomes.
The project team recognizes that the program will require an adequate supervision effort.
Integrated project management with the Welfare Reform Project Coordination Unit, which is performing
well, is expected to mitigate risks of possible project management problems.
Most Bank projects in Latvia that are under implementation are performing satisfactorily or
better. More recently, few problems have occurred in projects involving tariff adjustments, however,

Page 18
these issues do not apply to the current project.
4. Indications of borrower commitment and ownership:
Government commitment to the policy program and the project has been demonstrated through
policy dialogue with the Bank over the past four years, including several policy steps taken under the
Structural Adjustment Program. Key policies have been agreed in the Letter of Development Program
and the policy matrix which is the basis for the activities of the current project.15 A series of
Government regulations launched the key reform activities January 1, 1998. Organization of the project
preparation process included most top civil servants in respective policy areas and it is expected that they
will continue to serve through the possible changes in the Government political level. The Government
commitment to health reform and the project was also confirmed during the June 1998 visit of the Vice-
President of the World Bank, ECA Region.
Organization of the project preparation process through a high level project Steering Committee
and broad based working groups with clear mandates also proved the Government's commitment to
develop a project consistent with policy objectives and ensuring broad ownership. Three workshops
were organized to get feedback from the main stakeholders and one stakeholder conference to finalize the
policy matrix and project design.
5. Value added of Bank support in this project:
Although the Bank funds are relatively small compared to the overall health sector spending, the
value added of these funds function to: (i) act as catalyst and leverage for some long term policy
strategies; (ii) secure funding for some critical investments to ensure sustainability and credibility of the
health care reform; and (iii) mobilize and consolidate donor support.
E: Summary Project Analysis (Detailed assessments are in the project file, see Annex 9)
1. Economic (supported by Annex 5):
[X]Cost-Benefit Analysis: NPV=US$ 16.0 million;
Introduction. The main economic effects of Phase I of the program come from using the
resources of the health care system more efficiently. These effects are divided into 2 parts: (1) the effects
on system expenditures holding quality constant; and (2) the economic effects of quality improvements.
The indirect economic effects are also quantified, and the welfare effects of longer lives with lower
morbidity are noted (but not quantified).
Methodology. Keeping quality constant, the investments and policies are expected to save
money in the system. This savings can be divided into 3 elements:
(1) change in the mix of procedures purchased, toward more extensive use of ambulatory care
for a given diagnosis;
(2) an overall reduction in the number of services purchased, through improved tracking of
expenditures to reduce fraud, errors, waste, and duplication; and
(3) a reduction in the cost per admission, through the reduction in excess capacity, thus allowing
the capacity to be used more efficiently.
15  Letter of Development Program, Annex 3. Policy Matrix in Project Files.



Page 19
Elements (1) and (2) are realized in Component A: the development of the purchaser function.
Element (3) is realized in Component B: the consolidation of excess hospital and polyclinic capacity.
The strengthening of the General Practitioner system as an alternative and gatekeeper to hospital care also
factors into the Element (3) as a long term contributor to efficiency gains. In the analysis reported below,
these effects are analyzed separately, holding the other constant.
Next, the interactive effect of these policies as well as other policy changes is considered. This
interactive effect is expected to be quite strong. This is because better purchasing without capacity
rationalization will still result in high overall costs per inhabitant which are too high current quality
levels. If secondary care capacity is not reduced pari passu with improvements in contracting, cost per
bed day would rise substantially as bed days purchased fell, because the same fixed costs would be
spread over fewer bed days. Likewise, capacity rationalization needs the push from the financial
incentives of better purchasing. Otherwise, the political will to change is much weaker, so fewer closures
will result.
The overall quality of health care services purchased needs to increase if Latvia is to make a dent
on its poor health status indicators. Most important is the need for quality improvements in services
delivered, especially in family practice, diagnosis and treatment techniques (e.g. the treatment of TB), and
improved public health program which lead to behavioral change. Many of the quality improvements
supported in the project will have direct cost-lowering effects. Other cost efficiencies will stem from
improved selection of investment projects, although most of the benefits will be realized in the later years
of the program.
Public health activities of the Phase I will focus on identifying the main public health priority
areas and proposing cost-effective strategies to address those. The choice of strategies will draw on the
best international practice and evidence in selected areas. Phase II of the program will provide direct
support to these public health interventions and economic impact will be analyzed prior to the Phase II.
Also, the Phase I will support operational research in tobacco and alcohol consumption economics to
provide arguments for the increase of excise duties for these health damaging goods. Price barriers, sales
and advertising restrictions and other regulations accompanied by targeted and evidence based health
promotion measures are the most effective measures to influence health damaging behavior and at the
same time producing fiscal benefits for the state budget.
The overall fiscal effect of the proposed project is also considered. During appraisal, agreement
was reached with the Ministries of Finance and Welfare that, in the absence of a major fiscal crisis, health
expenditures will at least remain constant in real terms to support the reforms. Increased expenditures are
needed not only to raise system quality, but in addition to address the high excess demand in the system
for procedures (even at the existing level of quality). In addition, since independence, investment has
trickled down to a very low level. The physical plant has depreciated sharply, and must be refurbished if
even current quality is to be maintained.
As a result, total health care expenditures are not expected to go down in real terms or as a share
of the public budget during the project period or after. The savings generated by the improvements in
efficiency will be used for: (i) purchasing more procedures and loan charges; (ii) increased cost of inputs
to improve quality; (iii) investments to improve quality; and, (iv) consumption (higher salaries, lower
patient fees).
The project should also reduce the time that the population spends in the hospital and in getting
access to health care. This should increase productivity and economic growth.



Page 20
The time period for the economic analysis is 5 years, as the PV is positive by this time. The size
of the economic benefits after this point depend critically on the content and success of the next stage of
the project. In the economic analysis of the next stage, a longer time period will be employed.
Results of the Analysis
Improvements in purchasing. The costs for the improvement in purchasing are the costs of
Component A (less the economics training in the MoW), including recurrent costs over 5 years, and the
loan charges for the proposed Bank financing. The benefits (efficiency gains, reductions in fraud) are
calculated as a percent of health care service expenditures. The net present value of the stream of
benefits minus costs is equal to US$ 24.3 million, or 12 percent of 1998 health care expenditures.
Rationalization of capacity. The costs for the improvement in capacity are the subcomponents
B2-3, and the loan charges for the proposed Bank financing for these components. The benefits are the
savings in system-wide hospital fixed costs from closing hospitals and wings of hospitals. The net
present value of the 5 years stream of benefits minus costs is equal to US$ (-0.17) Million. The negative
net present value is explained by high upfront cost of training and re-training of general practitioners.
However, the net present value will become positive after 6 years and the investment will produce an
internal rate of return of 34 percent after ten years when critical mass of newly trained general
practitioners will have begun practicing efficient and effective treatment modalities under appropriate
financial incentives and most of the polyclinics will have been merged with hospital outpatient
departments. This analysis does not quantify the expected improved quality of service provided by
newly trained primary health care providers that an important indirect benefit of the project.
Project as whole and cost-effectiveness analysis. In this stage, the whole project costs (including
the recurrent expenditures for the 5 year period) are included. In addition to the benefits calculated
above, this calculation considers the extra cost savings beginning in year 3 from the synergistic effects of
the project as a whole, the increased return to investment spending from better project selection
(beginning year 5), and the cost savings improvements in public health programs will bring. The net
present value of the strearn of benefits minus costs is equal to US$ 16 million, or 7.6 percent of 1998
health care expenditures.
Sensitivity analysis. The project would still have a positive NPV of US$1.6 Million after 5 years
and IRR of 34% after ten years if project benefits be reduced by 75% and no synergistic effects occur.
Such pessimistic scenario may occur when macro-economic situation of the country will be less
favourable and implementation of the Government health reform program less successful
Fiscal impact. Total project costs are less than 5% of recurrent public health expenditures.
Health expenditures are expected to at least grow with total public expenditures, if not with total
economic growth in order to meet the quality targets of the project. Given that the total income elasticity
of demand for health care services in OECD countries is about 1.4 and it is probably even higher in
Latvia, if expenditures are contained within this envelope it will represent a major fiscal effort. In
addition, if the tobacco tax is raised according to project goals, additional revenues of about US$7.2
million over the project period could be realized.
Cost effectiveness analysis (Policy development, Public Health, Communications, Project
Coordination). The activities under these components do not allow for standard cost effectiveness
analysis. However, cost effectiveness arguments were considered for implementation arrangements. The
project includes significant training packages for policy development. Cost effectiveness has been an



Page 21
important factor in the design of these packages. All include local consultants as partners to foreign
consultants, to insure the development of local capacity. For example, in the investment policy
development component, most of the local training and materials and manual preparation will be done by
a local consulting firm with guidance provided by an international consultant. Communications
component activities and project coordination functions will be merged with existing Public Relations
Department of the MOW and World Bank Project Coordination Unit implementing the Welfare Reform
Project. Such arrangements will ensure synergies and cost effective resource use.
2. Technical
Component A: Implementation of health financing reforms. This component will establish the
SCHICF and the RSFs as active managers of the health care budget and purchasers of health care on the
part of their populations. The development of a sophisticated purchasing function is in a limited number
of health insurance funds is recognized internationally as one of the best methods for controlling costs
and insuring cost-effective use of resources in a decentralized system such as Latvia. The consolidation
of 33 local sickness funds to eight RSFs is much more appropriate for a country of Latvia's size.
The management information system. The MIS will have the purpose to collect, aggregate,
distill, correlate, analyze, and otherwise process medical diagnostic and treatment data that originate at
PHC providers and hospitals/polyclinics. Under the project, the specific application software comprising
the MIS will be developed for operation at SCHJCF, the Medical Statistics Bureau, and the Regional
Sickness Funds. Interfaces for data provision and inquiry into the database and statistics will also be
provided to Branch Offices of the Sickness Funds and to hospitals. General practitioners will receive a
special personal computer-based software package to be developed for collecting and reporting the data
required from them. The main functions and benefits of the MIS are described in Annex 2 of this PAD.
As part of the project team, an MIS working group, with the assistance of Swedish consultants
financed from the project preparation grant, developed a detailed approach to the implementation of the
MIS, which was further refined and agreed during project appraisal. Accordingly, the MIS would be
procured through an especially thorough specifications stage assisted by best-qualified international and
local experts, followed by competitive bidding (ICB) for the selection of a turnkey contractor which will
deliver all required hardware and standard software, integrate it with existing equipment, arrange the
installation of local and wide area network facilities, and design, develop, and install the MIS application
software.
Turnkey procurement by ICB, as planned, will almost certainly result in a contractor
development team blending best and up-to-date practice with local talent, a solution providing a
maximum likelihood of success, fastest realization, competitive costs, and best technology transfer effect
for the country. From overwhelming experience in other World Bank projects, it is furthermore known
that only the private sector has the flexibility needed for mobilizing a team of the effective size and skills
characteristic of this kind of endeavor. For all these reasons, the proposed turnkey contract approach is
viewed as the best technical option.
The turnkey procurement is designed to establish an initial, yet functional and country-wide MIS.
Further development and completion of the MIS would be pursued after stock taking of the situation at
the time and selection of the most practical approach.
Component B: Development and restructuring of health care services. The investment policy
development proposals will establish a centralized priority-setting mechanism for major capital
investments, while decentralizing smaller capital investment decisions to regional and institutional level,
accompanied by training and advice to equip regional organizations to carry out this role, and by clearer
financial incentives (similar institutions will face a similar cost of capital) and stronger monitoring
arrangements. This type of model for decision-making represents current best practice in public health

systems in Europe and Australasia. This component will also support development of a health technology
assessment and licensing function in a quasi-independent state-owned agency. Given Latvia's pluralistic
ownership of health service providers, this approach to management of investment in technology and
dissemination of evidence-based medicine is justifiable. The project will support development of higher
technical standards of health technology assessment, investment appraisal and priority-setting.
The overall strategy for health care development is in line with the best international practice.
The separation of PHC under the direction of General Practitioners, from secondary and specialist care is
appropriate and suitable for Latvia. The use of the methodologies of population health needs assessment,
health service planning, and hospital facilities functional planning to develop national and regional master
plans for reconfiguring secondary care services is a robust and appropriate tool to help an oversized,
formerly centrally-directed health system adjust capacity and move into a more decentralized
environment. The justification for using a centrally-directed planning in Latvia is two-fold. Firstly, the
scale of the adjustment needed is very large and hence requires pro-active change-management, to build
and sustain a constituency for controversial change, and to mitigate adverse impacts. Secondly, a
centrally-coordinated process will make best use of technical assistance to strengthen limited capacity and
support planning activity at regional level. Decentralized mechanisms to be developed under Part A and
Component B 1 of the Project will reinforce the objectives of the planned health service reconfiguration.
The emergency care plan will support rationalization of hospital services by planning a network
of ambulance stations that will achieve maximum travel time standards and higher quality emergency
care services. The plan appears to be technically robust, and is targeted at areas of poor quality identified
on the basis of measured outcomes of emergency care.
Component C: Implementation of Health Communication Strategies. This component will use
well known techniques such as focus groups, surveys, and ad campaigns to: (a) assess public knowledge
and views about the health care system; (b) prepare clear and understandable messages about the reform
program. On the basis of this research, it will also develop programs in the RSFs to strengthen public
feedback into the reform process at the community level. Use of these techniques is highly appropriate in
Latvia today as the society becomes more open and interest groups strengthen. These techniques have
been effective in other ECA countries in strengthening the social reform process.
3. Institutional:
Ministry of Welfare has shown strong political determination in taking key steps for
implementing health sector reforms. Policy design has been supported by the Bank assistance through
SALs and EU/PHARE and other bi-lateral technical assistance programs. However, to ensure success
and sustainability of the reforms, the implementation of reforms requires investments into institution
building and consensus building. The project is particularly designed to support these needs.
Uncertain legal status of SCHICF, RSFs and health care providers is currently somewhat
hindering implementation of some aspects of health reforms. Health insurance organizations are
currently proposed to be incorporated as public not-for-profit joint stock or limited liability companies
which poses some risks in terms of protecting fiduciary responsibilities for public funds and
accountability. Public Agency legislation is being drafted as an option in the framework of general civil
service reform and will be considered for health insurance organizations. Similarly, different forms of
legal status of public health care providers are causing an uneven playing field for access to public
investment funds. The policy matrix and the Government Development Program have identified these
issues and they are being addressed under the project. Institutional uncertainties prompted also phasing
of the APL program so that key institutional decisions will be addressed in Phase I and monitored through
Phase II trigger indicators before significant investments will be made in the health care delivery system.

Latvia has currently nine IBRD projects under implementation: solid waste management, welfare
reform, highway, municipal services development, Jelgava district heating project, three enterprise and
financial sector development and Liepaja environment projects. The proposed health project will be
supported by the PCU of the existing Welfare Reform Project which will support generic functions such
as procurement, disbursements and secretarial support by trained and experienced staff. Additional staff
will be hired for pure health project related tasks.
4. Social:
Parallel to the project preparation, a social assessment (SA) of poverty was carried out to
complement World Bank and UNDP projects and studies underway. 16 The study also addressed health
and health system issues. The main findings of the study were: (i) self-perceived deterioration of health
because of poor living conditions and stress; (ii) distrust in the skills of local practitioners in rural areas;
(iii) lack of understanding of health care benefits and personal obligations; (iv) unaffordable out-of-
pocket payments; (iv) lack of investment in preventive care. The proposed project will invest in
developing better quality PHC services, preventive public health activities and in the reform
communication activities to address some of the identified issues. Health financing reform addresses
unaffordable co-payments through replacing a 15 percent co-payment system with flat-fees with annual
and per admission ceilings. Informal payments are expected to decline in line with adjusting public
reimbursement prices to real costs, defining benefits package and the Government health reform
communication activities. The results of the SA were used in the design of the household survey to be
undertaken 1998/1999 that will provide quantitative information on the prevalence of the above issues,
design policy interventions during the future phases of the reform program and provides an instrument to
monitor access to health services.
During project preparation, Latvian experts carried out a stakeholder analysis with regard to the
proposed health care reform program and planned stakeholder consultation and participation strategy.
The analysis used Computer Assisted Political Analysis (CAPA) methodology to describe the political
dimensions of policy decisions and design effective strategies for influencing policies' feasibility. The
analysis organized descriptive information on policy content, key stakeholders (position, power, networks
and coalitions), policy consequences, interests of stakeholders, opportunities and obstacles for change.
The Government also employed a public relations firm to conduct public opinion research, focus
group interviews to identify public's and stakeholders knowledge and positions vis-a-vis health care
reform. This information was used to design public communications component of the project as well as
stakeholder and public engagement activities during the project preparation period.
Key social risks identified include those associated with the lack of stakeholder understanding
about health reform in general, the proposed hospital restructuring process, the resistance of key
stakeholders to the integrated restructuring of secondary care and the development of primary care. The
proposed project design intends to mitigate these risks through the implementation of an enhanced
stakeholder communication and involvement plan, the development of incentives for specialists through
retraining opportunities and assistance in establishing primary health care practices and through
demonstration effect of pilot primary health care and hospital restructuring projects.
5. Environmental assessment: Environmental Category C
If any, then a positive environmental impact is expected from facility rehabilitation projects,

stemming from better energy efficiency. Policy measures to introduce smoke-free public and working
space environment are also expected to have beneficial environmental impact.
6. Participatory approach:
The Government working method to develop policies and the project was to mobilize different
stakeholders through broad based working groups and several stakeholder conferences. Altogether five
working groups were created: Health Financing, Primary Health Care, Secondary Care Restructuring,
Investment Policy and Public Health. The working groups included representatives from stakeholders
relevant to particular policy area and component. The size of a working group was in the range of 4-19.
During the working process, feedback and broader discussion was arranged through several stakeholder
conferences: Health Financing Reform conference in May 1997, Health Reform and Initial Project
Design Conference in March 1998 and Stakeholder Project Design Workshop in May 1998. The
conference participation was in the range of 40-100. A three-day Project Design Workshop used
LogFRAME model and state of the art participatory methods, and was facilitated by a professional
participation program and a project management specialist.
F: Sustainability and Risks
1. Sustainability:
Financial sustainability is ensured through improved stability and certainty of the overall
financial envelope for the health system based on agreement reached with the Government about targets
for general level of health financing. Economic analysis demonstrates positive return on project
investment. The project does not generate significant incremental recurrent costs. Political risk and
sustainability issues are addressed in the table below.
2. Critical Risks (reflecting assumptions in the fourth column ofAnnex 1):

For the purpose of clarifying the meaning of the "single-pipe financing," the following definitions were agreed
during negotiations: (i) Health Care Services is the entire special health care budget plus the amount allocated
to finance health care items in the State basic budget (net of transfers to other budgets and p:-tient fees), and
the investments in the health care service sector financed by the State Investment Program; (ii) Single Pipe is
the amount allocated from the special health care budget to RSFs for the payment of health care services, plus
the amount allocated for administrative expenses.

Annex 2
Latvia Health Reform
Project Description
COMPONENT A. Implementation of Health Care Financing Reforms (US$ 8.3 million)
This component is designed to support the implementation of Latvia health financing reform
through supporting the key institutions involved in the reform.
A.1 Strengthening of Health Financing Policy (US$0.86 million)
The objective of this subcomponent is to establish a rational, predictable, transparent and stable
policy environment for managing the revenue and expenditure side of the health financing system. The
system should provide the Latvian population with quality, efficient, equitable and accessible service and
provide appropriate incentives for health care services providers. The component is closely linked with
and builds on the EU/PHARE supported project that will be completed by the expected effectiveness of
this project.
Elaboration of the Health Care Budget Allocation Model. The project will support activities
to (i) further elaborate and improve the "technical basis" for state budget allocation for health; (ii)
consolidate management of health expenditures into a single pipe, i.e. basic budget allocated to the
regional sickness funds based on risk-adjusted per capita formula. This process builds on the preparation
activities for the Latvia FY 1999 budget. For "technical basis" of the budget allocation, the Government
has decided to use targets for total health expenditures and state budget allocation for the health insurance
budget for 1999-2001. Under the project the Government will continue to explore a need based
approach to define the budget allocation to cover health needs of uninsured people (legitimate non-
contributors) and data from the MIS emerging under Phase I of the project will further strengthen the
Government's means to optimize the allocation of health resources.
Development of health care services payment models and contracts. The project will
support activities to develop DRG based PVQ contracting system for hospital care and a per capita based
payment system for primary health care (PHC) providers. The new payment system will be rolled out
during the Phase II of the health sector development program 2001-2004. Development of standards and
prices is an integral input to the payment system development. The project will also support activities to
pilot PHC fund holding in selected sites. This subcomponent is closely linked with MIS development
subcomponent that will support sickness funds, the Medical Statistics Bureau, and hospitals with
computer hardware and special purpose software, and PHC providers with special purpose software, for
the management of reports and financial transactions per service contracts.
Definition of basic benefits package. The project will support activities to review and define
the health services entitlement package commensurate with the available financial envelope. The
activities will be linked with Agency of Medical technology and Health Statistics (AMTHS) that will
provide recommendations on efficacy and cost-effectiveness of services that are considered for inclusion
to or exclusion from the basic benefits package.



Page 38
Definition Roles and Responsibilities of SCHICF and RSF. The component will support
activities to define and clearly establish appropriate legal form for State Compulsory Health Insurance
Central Fund (SCHICF) and Regional Sickness Funds. SCHICF will be incorporated either under public
agency law which is currently in the draft form or under not-for-profit joint-stock company law. Feasible
and acceptable to the Bank option will be defined and executed under the Phase I after legal analysis of
options and achieving consensus among main stakeholders.
The project will finance foreign and local technical assistance, seminars and short term study
tours to learn from relevant international experience.
A.2 Strengthening Institutional Capacity of Health Insurance Funds (US$2.20 million)
The objective of this subcomponent is support development of adequate infrastructure, skills mix
and necessary technical functions of the key institutions involved.
Renovation of SCHICF facility. The project will support renovation and furnishing of the
building SCHICF will be moving in 1999/2000.
Training programs and skills development. The project will support activities to provide
training for the following target groups (description of content): (i) all staff in SCHICF and RSFs and
provider representatives (aims and objectives of health care reform, organization, roles and
methodologies); (ii) managers in the MOW, SCHICF and RSFs (general management, change
management, leadership and authority, negotiation theory, conflict resolution, counseling, effective
communication); (iii) project managers in the MOW, SCHICF, RSF (project management); (iv) top
management in MOW, SCHICF, RSFs (team-building); (v) members of RSF Boards (aims and objectives
of health reform, purpose of a board mechanism, exercising political influence and accountability through
representation in the board); (vi) technical staff in the RSFs directly involved in the management of
contracts with the service providers (purchasing process, contracting methodology, negotiations theory,
evaluation of performance, benchmarking, needs assessment and epidemiology, main indicators of
provider efficiency); (vii) special target groups inside the health insurance system, e.g. personnel
management, medical and financial audit, secretarial support staff, etc. (specific training tailored to
specific needs, e.g. financial accounting, computer skills, etc.).
Development of Financial and Medical Audit Systems. This technical function has been
singled out as a priority for effective monitoring and control of the contracting process with health care
services providers. The project will finance an appropriate off-the-shelf accounting software and training
of staff.
Strengthening public relations function of the health insurance system. The activities
complement another subcomponent of the project supporting MOW in implementing health reform public
communication strategy. This subcomponent will focus on issues specifically pertinent to the functions of
SCHICF and RSFs, such as activities to inform and get feedback from general public about their rights
and obligations with regard to their health entitlements under Latvia health financing system; keep health
care services providers informed about the governing health insurance - health services provider
interface; and, issue regular reports on health insurance system performance to the Government,
Parliament and general public. The project will also support up-to-date communication means, such as
Internet.



Page 39
The project will finance foreign and local technical assistance, seminars and study tours, civil
works and office equipment and furniture, publication of information materials, television and radio
broadcasts, client surveys.
A.3 Implementation of a Management Information System (MIS) (US$5.23 million)
This component will support further development and implementation of modern management
information systems for the SCHICF and RSFs as well as development of special purpose software for
health care providers to effectively manage the purchaser/provider interface. The component builds on
information needs assessment for MIS and comprehensive conceptual framework for a health information
model developed during project preparation process.
Elaboration of health information model and technical platform. The activities will finalize
work on defining the needed information content and information flows for the effective functioning of
the health insurance system. The component takes into account needs to manage DRG/PVQ based
hospital and per capita based PHC payment systems, needs for aggregate analysis of national health
accounts and required financial reporting and planning for future health expenditures.
Development of standard reporting system for hospitals. The project will support
development of special purpose software for management of purchaser/provider interface, provide
hardware to selected hospitals, and training for end users.
MIS for SCHICF and the territorial sickness funds. The project will develop special purpose
software for effective information management in the nine territorial funds and their branch offices,
provide these offices with hard- and software for local area networks (LANs) and train end users.
Develop standard analytical reports and ad-hoc inquiry tools which support benchmarking,
new provider payment models, and PHC planning The data gathered, processed, and distilled by the
MIS will, among others, serve: (i) to provide up-to-date information on insured population (via a patients
registry) for needs assessment and budget allocation formulae; (ii) the management of per capita based
PHC contracts; (iii) to enable the tracking of cross-boundary flows of patients and the counter-checking
of the related financial transactions. The MIS will also allow the Medical Statistics Bureau to increase
the number, and improve the usefulness, of its reports.
Development of special purpose software for PHC providers. Software will be developed for
PHC practices to effectively meet the financial management and reporting requirements set by per capita
PHC financing methodology.
The project will finance foreign and local technical assistance, computer hard and software,
customized application software development, training seminars and study tours, publication of manuals.
COMPONENT B: Development of Health Care Services (US$8.10 million)
B.1 Investment Policy Development (US$0.93 million)
Policy development sub-component will focus on elaborating national health care investment
policy; development of proposed policy instruments and institutional capacity to implement this policy.
The subcomponent builds on the Investment Policy Note developed by the Government and prepares



Page 40
CHIP and capital financing plan for implementation of health services restructuring projects in the Phase
11 of the proposed APL.
Elaboration of national health sector investment and capital financing policy. The project
will support functions of Ministry of Welfare and SCHICF to set investment policy, and conduct
investment planning and monitoring procedures at national and regional levels. The project will support
development of an Investment Procedures guidelines document, delineating "strategic" investments
requiring national or regional approval and "routine" investment decisions delegated to provider
institutions, clarifying the roles and responsibilities of different levels of administration, setting out
criteria and procedures for priority-setting, and establishing monitoring and evaluation of investment
projects. The guidelines will be followed in developing the CHIP for Phase II. The project will also
support development of a. capital financing plan for Phase II, underpinned by a consistent and robust
regulatory and allocation framework for access to investment funds by health care providers to ensure
similar providers face a similar cost of capital for similar investments, irrespective of ownership status or
source of finance.
Development of Appraisal Methodology and Institution building. Support will be provided
to the MOW, SCHICF and RSFs to strengthen their capacity to regulate and monitor health sector
investments and to a quasi-independent Agency of Medical technologies and Health Statistics (AMTHS)
which will determine what medical technologies are permitted in the Latvian health system based on
evidence of efficacy and cost-effectiveness, and advise on technology investment proposals included in
the National and Regional Master Plans. The AMTHS will also promote evidence-based medical practice
among health care professionals. The project will also support development of a manual for project
design, appraisal and cost-effectiveness analysis, and support training programs for health fund staff in
economic and financial analysis of investment projects, and for AMTHS staff in health care technology
assessment.
Hospital Legal F'ramework. The project will support development of a standard legal
framework and monitoring arrangements for all public hospitals, state and Municipal, to enable all
hospitals to be reimbursed for service provided (rather than inputs), and to exercise appropriate autonomy
over purchases of inputs End routine investments. The framework will balance increases in autonomy
with strengthened monitoring arrangements and appropriate financial duties and incentives. This will be
supported by development of institutional management models and unified accounting systems.
The project will finance foreign and local technical assistance, seminars and study tours,
literature and training materials, office refurbishment for the Agency of Medical Technology and Health
Statistics (AMTHS), and computer hard- and software.
B.2 Support to Primary Health Care Reform (US$2.58 million)
Primary health care (PHC) implies General Practitioner (GP) based outpatient health care
services that integrate "traditional" primary health care functions (e.g. immunization), primary and
secondary prevention of non-communicable diseases (health education and screening) and personal
curative health care services aimed at responding to common health problems and providing altematives
to hospital care. The aim of the component is to develop PHC provider training capacity, train GPs and
allied medical personnel, elaborate policy framework and instruments, establish pilot practices in selected
regions and evaluate early results of the pilots. Phase II will support the roll-out of the reform through all
country.



Page 41
Policy development. The project will support the Ministry of Welfare in elaborating an
appropriate legal framework for general practitioners, and development of practice guidelines and
protocols, including (i) screening and diagnostic procedures; (ii) medical case management; (iii) reporting
to the national and sub-national health authorities. These guidelines will take into account other country
experiences through specialized literature, technical assistance and study tours. Ministry of Welfare will
also evaluate early results of the pilot practices and make adjustments for larger scale roll-out in Phase II
of the APL. The activities are closely linked with the health financing component that will develop PHC
financing model and software for managing health insurance-PHC services interface.
Training of GPs and allied PHC professionals. PHC strategy calls for substantial investment
into training and re-training of primary health care personnel and codification of professional standards.
The activities will support developing training capacity and supporting training and re-training of PHC
professionals in the Medical Academy, Medical Faculty of Riga University, Postgraduate Training
Institute and Nursing College. Selection of the training institute will be conducted through a tender
based on terms of reference and procedures acceptable to the Bank.
Pilot PHC practices. The project will support establishing pilot PHC practices in selected sites
that will undertake practical training activities. Integration of polyclinics in GP reform will also be tested
in selected sites. These practices will also participate in the piloting of PHC payment methodology and
the changes in physician and nurses practice behavior. Results will be used to make adjustments for roll-
out PHC reform in Phase 11 of the APL.
The project will finance foreign and local technical assistance, training equipment and supplies,
specialized literature, computer hard and software, study tours and fellowships.
B.3 Support to Hospital Restructuring Program (US$3.17 million)
Latvia's secondary care development strategy foresees provision of secondary care through a
homogenous network of public health care providers, the basic unit of which will be a multispecialty
hospital providing a comprehensive set of secondary care services, including emergency care. Current
single specialty hospitals will transfer their acute care services and functions to multispecialty hospitals.
Current "small" hospitals or those single specialty hospitals which do not become multispecialty
emergency centers will have the following options: (i) conversion into a PHC center, (ii) conversion into
an intermediate care inpatient facility ("community hospitals"), providing low intensity health care,
rehabilitation and social care for patients who no longer need to be in an acute care hospital, but who are
not yet able to return home; (iii) conversion into a nursing home (in partnership with municipal social
care services) providing longer term nursing care (e.g. for the elderly, mentally ill etc.); (iv) sale to the
private sector for conversion into a nursing home; or, (v) if no longer appropriate as a location for health
or social care services, closure and disposal. The optimum number and location of multispecialty
hospitals, long-stay and social care beds and the strategy dealing with small hospitals will be developed
through national and regional master plans during Phase I of the APL (policy development component of
current project), with associated investment plans for Phase II.
The project will conduct necessary analytical and political consensus building tasks for the
preparation of implementing regional health services restructuring programs, and will implement a pilot
hospital restructuring project in Latgale region.
Developing regional health services master plans. Project will support the development of
agreed planning methodology for undertaking needs assessment for appropriate supply and distribution of



Page 42
hospital services in each region and nationally; undertaking such analysis on regional and national level
and considering viable options for the new configuration of secondary health care services consistent
with restructuring of primary health care; developing and building consensus around health services
restructuring plans in regions and nationally and developing detailed investment projects to support and
facilitate regional and national restructuring and consolidation plans. These plans will be supported by
Phase II of the proposed APL. This component will build on the experience of donor-supported
(Sweden, Denmark) pilot master planning projects and will pursue further mobilization of donor support
for this project.
The objective of the pilot project is to provide an example of implementing Latvia health
services restructuring strategy and to develop PCU and client capacity to implement investment projects
involving civil works and equipment procurement. Larger scale hospital restructuring programs will be
undertaken in the subsequent phases of the APL. The pilot site was selected based on the following
criteria (see Table ) and commitment of local authorities.

Hospital Management Training. The project will support establishment of a hospital
management training center within an existing medical education facility, which may be assisted by
donor finance for training needs analysis and faculty development. Thirty senior managers and over 600
middle managers will be trained in Phase I to prepare them for increased responsibilities in Phase II.
Emergency Care Development. The project will support development of a higher-quality
emergency care system to accompany reductions in the number of hospitals providing emergency care.
There will be an assessment of training needs for new roles for emergency care personnel, strengthening
of the emergency care training facility, and training of emergency care personnel.
The project will finance local and foreign technical assistance, training, seminars, civil works,
medical equipment, computer hard and software, and severance payments.
B.4 Support to Public Health Reform (US$ 1.43 million)
The component will strengthen the Government capacity to proactively address the main public
health challenges of the Latvia population through the following activities.
Strengthening public health surveillance function. The project will support establishing and
institutionalizing a survey instrument to measure the prevalence of key health status determinants,
including health behavior, attitudes, availability and understanding of related informnation. This
instrument will be conducted regularly at 2-year intervals and will provide the basis for public health
decision making and evaluation of progress towards achieving national and sub-national targets in key
health problem areas. The project will build capacity for conducting surveys as well as result analysis.
Developing a public health report and strategy. The project will support developing a
National Public Health Strategy and a National Public Health Report. These documents will build on the
result of public health surveillance and will establish national public health priorities, define relevant
indicators and targets and describe strategies to tackle the priority public health issues. The project will
also support activities to build consensus around the strategy and institutionalizing regular publishing of
national public health reports.
Strengthening key public health institutions. The project will support the Department of
Public Health (DPH), Center of Health Promotion, Institute of Public Health and Inter-Sectoral Public
Health Committee in training their staff, ensuring access to up-to-date international body of knowledge
and establishing adequate infrastructure.
Developing public health policies. The project will support activities to facilitate development
and enactment of specific pieces of legislation with strong public health externalities, for example
regulatory acts on increasing tobacco excise tax, smoke-free public facilities, ban of tobacco advertising,
etc. The activities will include relevant operational research (tobacco economics study, alcohol and
injuries) as well as support for consensus building.
Implementing selected health promotion programs. The project will support selected small
health promotion programs in CVD, TB, mental health and drug abuse areas.
The component will be implemented by the Department of Public Health of the Ministry of
Welfare and the National Center for Health Promotion. The component will finance local and foreign
technical assistance, stakeholder seminars, fellowships and study tours, publications, training equipment



Page 44
and supplies, computer hard and software, selected health promotion programs, and incremental recurrent
costs during the life of the project.
COMPONENT C: Implementation of Health Reform Communications Strategy (US$ 0.61 million)
The goals of the longer term public and stakeholder communications plan are to improve public
knowledge and awareness of health reform; improve stakeholder knowledge, awareness and support of
health reform; help the public better understand their rights regarding access to health care services;
establish an understanding of the appropriate utilization of services and personal responsibility for health
and the use of health services; and, build public support for government initiatives as health reforms
evolve. Activities undertaken under this project will support the institutional strengthening of MOW
Public Relations Unit and implementation of a two-year public communication strategy.
The two-year communications strategy will aim at creating improved delivery and use of health
care services by generating a greater sense of awareness of health and health reform issues among the
public and stakeholder groups. The objectives of the plan are to: explain health reforms and why they are
taking place; identify how the public can most effectively and appropriately access health services and
participate in the health insurance program; explain how society as a whole will benefit from reforms;
identify the role of physicians and other care providers; build credibility and support for health reform
initiatives by replacing misinformation and misunderstanding with practical knowledge; and, build a
renewed sense of personal responsibility for health. The two-year strategy would be built in three annual
campaign blocks of six weeks duration for each campaign. This will allow maximum impact in message
reinforcement as well as allow for modification of certain campaign elements as the health reform
evolves. Strategic campaign management issues include optimum timing, sustained messaging, right
media mix with appropriate market reach/impact, continual monitoring and evaluation, e.g., public
opinion polling, media coverage, and gathering of political and stakeholder responses, and campaign
adjustments to reflect evolving issues.
The project will finance local and foreign technical assistance, study tours, seminars, print
materials, TV and radio spots, public opinion surveys and incremental recurrent costs of campaign
management.
COMPONENT D: Project Management (US$ 0.50 million)
The overall objectives of the project management component would be to ensure that: (i) the
project is implemented in a timely fashion to achieve its agreed Development Objectives; (ii) Project
activities are coordinated and monitored with timely feedback to management and stakeholders; (iii)
funds are spent in accordance with procurement guidelines with due attention to economy and efficiency;
and (iv) stakeholders have Project ownership and receive the benefits from the Project inputs in a timely
fashion.
To achieve these objectives, it is essential that the project include a strong project management
component which would have responsibility mainly in two areas: (i) to act as facilitator for Project
entities or line departments which are the beneficiaries of institutional development activities supported
under the project; and (ii) to be responsible for all project financial, managerial, and administrative
responsibilities required to implement the Project in a coordinated and integrated fashion with multiple
key players and financiers.



Page 45
The Project would be implemented over two years through the Ministry of Welfare, utilizing the
already-existing administrative structure of the Project Coordination Unit (PCU) established in 1996 for
implementation of the Welfare Reform Project. A Project Steering Committee, chaired by the State
Minister of Health, would be responsible for strategic and policy decisions, and for overseeing project
implementation and achievement of the project's development objectives. The Steering Committee has
guided the preparation process with the support of a Health Project Coordinator. The Health Project
Coordinator would be directly accountable to the Deputy State Secretary of Health and Project Director.
The PCU is already staffed with experienced procurement and financial officers, and will continue to
function throughout the completion of the Program as proposed for 2004. The Health Project would
finance about six staff in the PCU: Health Project Coordinator, Public Health and Implementation
Specialist, Accountant, Procurement Specialists (2), and Secretary.
Project Coordination and Organizational Structure: During the project preparation phase,
Component Working Groups representing various stakeholders prepared project activities under guidance
and supervision of the Project Steering Committee. During implementation, stakeholders and entities at
the central and local levels responsible for health care management, financing, and service delivery will
be directly responsible for project implementation as outlined below and in the Project Implementation
Plan (PIP) (see Organizational Chart in Attachments to Annexes). Each implementing entity, line
department, or authority will be responsible for appointing a component or activity coordinator who
would work closely with the PCU in overseeing implementation:
(i) Steering Committee (SC): Project decision-making body endorsing project activities. SC
membership is: State Minister of Health (Chairperson); Secretary of State; Deputy Under-
Secretary of State for Health-Project Director; Budget and Finance Department Director; Health
Affairs Department Director; and Project Coordinator.
(ii) Project Director: The Deputy State Secretary of Health acts as the Project Director and:
Chief executive overseeing project implementation and achievement of the project's development
objectives;
(iii) Project Coordination Unit (PCU): Monitor progress in achievement of project outcomes
through project monitoring indicators; conduct procurement; maintain project accounts and
records; liaise with project entities, donors, and the Bank; host an Annual Implementation
Review as the basis for approving annual Health Investment Programs; administer the use of
Loan and SIDA funds; oversee technical assistance;
(iv) State Compulsory Health Insurance Central Fund (SCHICF): Oversee implementation
of Component A, Implementation of Health Financing Reforms. The SCHICF will maintain the
Working Group, recruit an MIS Manager and establish an MIS Specification Team for finalizing
MIS procurement documents;
(v) MOW Budget and Finance Department: Oversee implementation of Component B. 1,
Investment Policy Development;
(vi) MOW Health Department: Oversee implementation of Components B.2, Support to PHC
Reforms, and B.3, Support to Hospital Restructuring Program;
(vii) MOW Public Health Department: Oversee implementation of Component B.4, Support to
Public Health Reform;
(viii) MOW Public Relations Unit: Oversee implementation of Component C, Implementation
of Health Reform Information and Communications strategy.
Donor Coordination: The PCU will be responsible for coordinating the participation of other
donors in project-related activities. SIDA provided significant technical assistance in the development of



Page 46
a regulatory framework for the operation of central and regional insurance funds, and will continue to
take a lead role during project implementation through the provision of parallel financing for this
component (SIDA Grant of US$2.0 Million). The SIDA Grant will be administered by the PCU.
Monitoring and Evaluation: The PCU will be responsible for: (i) collecting data and closely
monitoring the implementation of all project activities according to agreed monitoring indicators; (ii)
liaising with the respective implementing entities to ensure performance indicators are being collected
and monitored; (iii) monitoring progress towards achieving trigger and other performance indicators for
the Policy Matrix; and (iv) assessing progress in achieving the Project's Development Objectives and
specific Outputs.
Annual Implementation Review: The PCU will prepare and organize an annual implementation
review of progress achieved during implementation of Phase I of the project. Results of these reviews
will be the basis for approval of the Second Phase of the APL. The PCU will also oversee the preparation
work for the Implementation Plan for Phase II of the APL, which would immediately follow the
successful trigger assessment. A comprehensive final evaluation will be carried out at the completion of
the project as part of the Implementation Completion Report (ICR).
Progress Reporting: Semester progress reports will be prepared by the PCU according to an
agreed format, and will become due February 15 and August 31 for the preceding semester period.
Agreed Progress Report formats will include a format for reporting on benchmarks and monitoring
indicators.
Accounting, Auditing, and Financial Reporting: (i) Accounts and Audits: The existing PCU,
currently managing the implementation of the Welfare Reform Project, will also maintain separate
accounts for the Health Project for all project components, according to internationally accepted
accounting standards. A Chartered Accountant has been providing technical assistance to the PCU,
including the use of accounting software, and its accounts were audited by Arthur Andersen, which won
the competition for the audit. The audit presented a clean opinion, and the MOW will implement the
recommendations of the Management Letter. The Government has agreed to finance an annual
independent audit for the Health Project accounts, according to terms of reference acceptable to the Bank.
The counterpart budget is included in the project cost estimates. (ii) Special Account: A Special
Account would be opened and maintained in DEM, in a commercial bank acceptable to the Bank, with an
Initial Deposit equivalent to about four months' expenditures; (iii) Financial Reporting: Financial
reports will be included in Semester Progress Reports. Supporting documentation for SOE expenditures
will be maintained separately by Withdrawal Application and will be made available to Bank officials for
review.

Background
Latvia's main health issues are similar to other European countries. Aggregate
health indicators have deteriorated compared to the pre-transition period. As a
result, health status in Latvia has deteriorated in comparison with EU countries
Latvia wants to join.
In 1997 the population in Latvia was 2,480 million and the average life span was
63.9 years for males and 75.6 years for females. Total mortality of the male
population was 2,041 per 100,000, and for females - 972 per 100,000. Currently, 56
percent of adults in Latvia die of cardio-vascular disease. This is one of the highest



Page 48
rates in the world. The morbidity rate from tuberculosis has increased 2.3 times
since 1991, and drug addiction has also been on the rise.
The Health system does not address the root causes of ill health because of: (i)
ineffective mechanisms for optimization of coordination and planning of the health
care system; (ii) the fragmentary nature of the financing structure and ill-defined
"basket" of services; (iii) an excessive amount of low quality hospitals; (iv)
disproportion human resources (to few skilled nurses and managers); (v)
restrictions on the ability of patients, to choose a medical establishment; and (vii)
ineffective public health policies and programs to address high priority health
problems.
To address these problems we have started to implement reform in the health
sector. The strategic directions for the reform are the following: (i) reform of healt]h
financing and development of investment policy for the health care system; (ii)
restructuring and development of the health care system based on the prepared
strategy of primary and secondary health care; and (iii) improvement of the
population's health through effective public health measures.
Health financing reform
At the time independence was restored in Latvia, the health care system was
funded from the state and municipal budgets. In 1993, reforms to the system began
to reflect financing based on work actually performed. The Central Settlement
Fund (the State Sickness Fund) was set up for the purpose of systematic
management of health care financing; thirty-three municipal sickness insurance
funds and three industry sickness insurance funds were established. In 1996 the
Government began gradual implementation of compulsory health insurance in
Latvia to ensure stable and equal funding per capita in the whole country and
guarantee a certain level of health care. As a result, at the beginning of 1997
financial resources for health care were centralized.
A year later, to reduce administrative costs and to reform the health financing
system towards clear separation of purchasing and provision of health services and
increased autonomy of health care providers, the government consolidated existing
municipal and industry sickness insurance into eight regional sickness insurance
funds.



Page 49
We intend to establish a rational, cost effective and transparent system of health
care planning and financing which will meet the needs of the population. We will
implement the development plan for the State Compulsory Health Insurance
Central Fund and regional sickness funds and will carry out the reform of health
care financing based on the concept of money following the patient, not the service
unit.
Health System Restructuring Reform
In 1996 the government accepted The Strategy For Health Care Development in
Latvia which determined as a priority the development of a family doctor based
Primary Health Care (PHC) model. Physicians practice (currently there are 361)
and centers of primary health care (currently 4) were set up. However, at the
beginning of 1998, there were still only 1,316 doctors and 800 middle-level
medical personnel employed in primary health care, and their qualifications did not
meet the requirements of a high quality PHC system.
We are planning to undertake measures for further development of primary health
care and the establishment of a network of providers of primary health care
services in Latvia. The latter includes: (i) the development of quality standards for
primary health care; (ii) training of the providers of primary health care; and (iii)
arrangement of practices for family doctors.
At the beginning of 1998 there were 118 hospitals in Latvia including 43 multi-
profile hospitals, 48 local and 27 specialized hospitals. The structure of providers
of services for secondary health care is not optimal and does not ensure patients'
with high quality, rational and cost-effective medical services. The state investment
program  in hospitals is irregular and lacks a system  for setting priorities. In
addition, investment is largely limited to state institutions.
We plan to develop a transparent and sustainable health sector investment program
and to build relevant institutional capacity. We also intend to optimize the structure
of providers of secondary health care services through consolidation to achieve
increased quality of secondary health care services, cost effectiveness and a
rational availability to patients.
Public Health

According to the estimate of national experts, Latvia ranks as one of the highest
countries in Europe in terms alcohol consumption per inhabitant -- consumption
exceeds 12 litres annually. In 1997, 67 percent of men and 26 percent of women
were smokers. Accidents, poisoning and other external factors were among the
main causes of death in 1997. Their number increased (from 156 per 100,000
inhabitants to 158 per 100,000 inhabitants). Every tenth case involved the use of
alcohol.
The Ministry of Welfare in co-operation with the World Health Organisation
(WHO) has developed a long-term development programme for broader public
health activities including health promotion. According to the strategy, we will
carry out professionally managed measures for improving health to facilitate
improvement in the quality of life for the population and patients, including
educating the population on issues related to health care, prevention of ailments
and risk factors.
Reform Implementation Plan
To continue to improve health care system in Latvia and achieve effective
utilization of resources assigned for this purpose, in cooperation with the World
Bank, we have commenced a long-term development program to support Latvian
Health reform. The goal of the Latvia Health Reform Program is to improve the
effectiveness, quality and availability of health care services to the population.
We plan to implement the Latvia Health Reform Program in phases. In order to
launch health-financing reform and establish institutional and policy framework for
health care delivery system restructuring, the following steps will be undertaken
during Phase I (1999 - 2000).
Health financing reform will improve the transparency and predictability of the
health financing system by: preparing a multi-year budget with monitorable
indicators; eliminating earmarks for the State Compulsory Health Insurance Central
Fund (reserve, administration); setting a target of maintaining the current level of
real health care expenditures for 1999 - 2001 through a combination of state
budget financing and earmarked income taxes; allocating 90 percent of current
expenditures to eight regional health insurance funds to purchase services by
budget year 2000, and introducing allocation based on a risk-adjusted capitation
formula, administered by the State Compulsory Health Insurance Central Fund.



Page 51
We will ensure sustainability of the health financing in the following way: in 1999,
total expenditures (exclusive of World Bank Loan financing and patient fees)
would increase by 18 percent in nominal terms over the 1998 expenditures; in 2000
- 2001, state basic budget financing for health care services (exclusive of patient
fees) will be not less than 10% of state basic budget revenue. Investment financing
will be included in the special health insurance budget; the earmark of the income
tax revenues for health care services remains not less than 28.4% of total revenues.
We intend to strengthen the institutional development of the health insurance funds
and develop a management information system for them. By 2001, DRG/PVQ-
based hospital services contract methodology will be developed.
We will develop an investment strategy and financing plan for Phase II. This will
be based on national and regional masterplans and will invest in the highest value
projects regardless of hospital ownership or source of finance to support health
system restructuring. With the help of a systemized and streamlined investment
policy the structure for providers of health care services will be rationalized and
made cost-effective. By the end of 2000, standard hospital legal framework will be
established and the CHIP will be developed according to agreed methodology and
relevant masterplans.
The development of primary health care is a high priority in Latvia. We intend to
develop an appropriate legal framework for family doctors and will undertake
training and re-training of providers of primary health care services. We also plan
to establish model PHC practices in selected sites that would also undertake
practical training activities.
We will continue public health institution building activities to strengthen
institutional capacity to analyze data and propose effective public health
interventions and will develop public health surveillance capacity to ensure
availability of adequate data for decision making. We will carry out public health
studies to support development and approval of antismoking legislation. By the end
of 2000, well-defined and publicly approved public health strategy with priorities
and measurable targets will be developed.

We recognize that understanding and acceptance of health care reforms by the
general public as well as by key stakeholders is critical for successful
implementation. We intend to strengthen institutional development of the Public
Relations Unit and to implement sustainable communications activities.

Annex 5
Latvia Health Reform
Economic Analysis Summary
Introduction
The analysis focuses on the costs and benefits that can be expected from the proposed project.
The assumptions used to calculate the net economic benefits of the project in terms of the internal rate of
return (IRR) and the net piresent value (NPV) are based on Latvia data, informal studies and project team
estimates as well as international experience (see Table D to this Annex).
Economic Analysis
The economic analysis is a cost-benefit analysis where both the costs and benefits are measured
(or estimated) in money terms. On the costs side, both current and investment costs are considered
irrespective of source of finance. The benefits are limited to direct financial benefits that are measurable
and some indirect economic benefits that are likely to occur as a result of the project. In addition, there
are likely to be other intangible benefits such as improved quality and health status, better access, etc.,
that are not quantified in the analysis. The analysis is based on costs and benefits over a five year period.
All costs and benefits are presented in 1998 prices (no adjustment for inflation). The discount rate used is
6 percent.l All figures are presented in Latvian Lats (LVL).
The costs of the project and the expected benefits are estimated in three main areas each
including components that work against similar targets: (i) Institutional Development of Health Financing
Agencies that aim at strengthening the role of the purchasers through development and implementation of
new payments models and contracting system; (ii) Health Care Services Restructuring through Primary
Health Care reform and optimization of hospital capacity; and (iii) Policy Development that considers the
total costs and benefits of the project including synergistic effects and indirect financial benefits.
Institutional development of health financing agencies
The different subproject investments to improve the purchaser functions are analyzed
simultaneously. These include programs to improve effectiveness of budget process, develop payments
models for health care providers and improving the contracting system. A substantial part of this
component is an investment in a Management Information System (MIS) for sickness funds.
The analysis uses an assumption that access to information improves decision-making and the
efficiency of production. The value of information could be derived from the production function of a
health care organization, which shows the relationship between use of inputs and the quantity of
production. The production is not only a function of the use of inputs but also of human capital, its skills
and knowledge to store, retrieve and use existent information.
The discount rate is set to reflect the social rate of time preference. In the literature there is a discussion about
the choice of discount rate. Drummond et al. (1997) recommend a lower discount rate if future costs are not
inflated. Consultant report in project files.



Page 57
The international experience of implementing a purchaser/provider split in a budget-based health
system shows a yearly increase in productivity of 3 to 6 percent.1 In this analysis, improved productivity
is estimated at I percent of health service expenditures the first year and up to 3 percent at the end of the
period.
This component of the project has total costs of LVL 5.0 million, total benefits of LVL 19.6
million; and a net present value of LVL 14.6 million. More detailed information on the analysis of this
component is presented in Table A of this Annex.
Health Care Delivery Restructuring
The analysis includes the expected economic impact of developing regional and national health
services masterplans, a pilot project in the Latgale region and investments and training in Primary Health
care (PHC).
Changes in the patterns of illness and changes in medical technology will reduce the need for
inpatient beds. In order to realize economic gains from this change it will be necessary to restructure the
hospital services. This requires a planning exercise by hospitals, owners of hospitals (local governments)
and sickness funds about the closure and reconfiguration of some health care facilities and certain
services to be consolidated into larger units. The project supports development of regional and national
health services masterplans as well as a pilot project in the Latgale region. Investments in primary health
care will be important as an alternative to in-patient care. It is expected that the structural reforms will
force cutbacks in beds, admissions and fixed capacity at hospitals.
Project support for restructuring of the Latvian health care system is expected to have a
significant impact on hospital admission rates, average length of stay (ALOS), number of beds and bed-
days and the size and quality of the physical plant of hospital facilities. The change of treatment
modalities from hospital care to outpatient and primary health care is expected to reduce in-patient
utilization by 5,000 bed-days annually up to 20,000 bed-days saved at the end of the Program. The pilot
project in the Latgale health region will also produce savings LVL 200,000 annually based on local
calculations.2 However, it is important to note that the major implementation activities will take place
during Phase II of the Program during 2001-2004.
This sub-component has total costs of LVL 3.2 million; total benefits of LVL of 3.0 million and a
net present value of LVL (-118,000). The negative present value of the investment after 5 years is due
to high upfront investment into training and re-training of General Practitioners. However, the
component starts to pay off after six years as more and more newly trained primary health care providers
will begin to practice modem treatment modalities under appropriate financial incentives and most of the
policlinics will merge with multi-purpose hospital outpatient departments. After ten years, the
investments would yield an estimated internal rate of return of 30 percent. More detailed information
on costs and benefits of this component is presented in Table B of this annex.
The Swedish health authorities (the County Councils) showed such increase in productivity during the period
of implementation of a purchaser/provider split model (the Federation of the County Councils 1994).
Econometric tests shows that these changes are significant (Gerdtham, Rehnberg & Tambour 1998). Also the
introduction of self-governing trusts in the hospital sector in the NHS in U.K. shows an improvement in the
use of hospital capacity (Smee 1995). Consultant report in project files.

Policy Development and the Project as a Whole
In this section the total costs and benefits of the Project are analyzed. In addition to the results of
the analysis of the previous sections, costs and benefits related to investments in implementing the health
financing policy framework, development of modern public health programs, and consolidated health
investment and capital financing policy are considered. Also, costs of implementing the health reform
communications strategy and project administration are added.
The benefits of investment in policy framework and public health program development are
difficult to quantify. The analysis assumes an improved rate of return on investments from better
investment decisions estimated at 10 percent of present investment from year 2002. The yield from
investments in public health programs is estimated at I percent savings of total health care expenditures
from year 2001 onwards. In addition, savings from synergistic effects of several sub-components are
estimated at I percent of health care expenditures from year 2001. Indirect benefits from productivity
gains from reduction of disability days are expected to incur from shorter ALOS and less admissions to
hospitals. Since most patients are either elderly, children and other people not at work, the assumption
was made that about 20 percent of all bed day savings result in productivity gains.
Training of general practitioners and allied medical personnel is also expected to improve the
quality of care in terms of better skills of primary health care providers as well as continuity and
comprehensiveness of care. In fact, one of the objectives of the reform program is to improve
populations' satisfaction with the health care system. As all the investment costs related to GP training
were included in the analysis of the health care delivery restructuring component, quality improvement as
a non-monetized indirect benefit can be added zero cost.
The summary of estimated total costs and benefits of the project has a total cost of LVL 17.4
million and total benefits of LVL 27.0 million and a net present value of LVL 9.6 million. The project
investments would yield an estimated internal rate of return of 56 percent after ten years. More
detailed information of summary analysis is presented in Table C of this annex.

from tobacco tax that is a
component on the public health
program (Table 1). The assumption is based on an increase of tobacco excise duty by LVL 0.01 the first
year and then LVL 0.02 the following year. At the end of the Program in 2005, the price of a pack of
cigarettes is expected to be on average LVL 1.2, of which LVL 0.58 will be taxes (according to EU
recommendations). The price-elasticity is estimated at [-0.5] based on intemational experience.  The

ex,tra revenues that come from increased tobacco tax would not necessarily be allocated to health care.
Still, it will strengthen the public finances and contribute to the sustainability of health care financing.
The sustainability of the project is analyzed by relating the costs of the project to the total health
care expenditures (HCE), total public expenditures and GDP to determine the overall burden of the
proposed project on public finances and overall economy (Table 2). Real GDP growth is assumed to be 6
percent annually, share of the total government spending to decline from 36.0 percent in 1998 to 32.5
percent in 2002. The project investment will represent a proportion of health care expenditures during
the life of the project that is deemed to be sustainable for the Government spending and economy in
general.

Sensitivity analysis
The present analysis are based on key assumptions of a favorable macro-economic environment,
Government commitment to the changes proposed in the Government reform program supported by this
Project, as well as a number of technical assumptions about projected savings (financial benefits).
The macro-economic development is one of the most important determinants of health care
spending. The projected growth of GDP is estimated to be 6 percent over the next 4 years. International
comparisons show that the income elasticity of health expenditures across countries is greater than I
(from 1.15 to 1.31) which means that health spending grows at a faster rate than the growth of the overall
economy.1 International experience also confirms the Latvia experience that the health care sector is
very sensitive and suffers during economic recessions.
Stable and long-term financing of health care. The Latvian health care system showed an
unstable pattern regarding revenues due to economic problems outside the health care sector. Especially
the investments in health services decreased during the recession period. The commitments to maintain
the 28.4 percent earmark on income tax and a 10 percent general budget contribution for health
expenditures, following through on consolidating financial flows into a "single-pipe" and a commitment
I   OECD (1995).

to sustainable health investment program are crucial factors for stabilizing and effectively control the
growth and allocation of health care resources.
The development of the purchaser function in terms of strengthening the institutional capacity of
sickness funds will be a determinant for a more efficient use of resources. The replacement of "fee-for-
service" payments by global expenditure and service volume contracts will give the sickness funds a
stronger positions in the allocation of resources. The success of sickness funds will be dependent on their
competence and skills as purchasers.
The commitment to the national and regional masterplans regarding restructuring of the hospital
sector are crucial for releasing resources. If restructuring in terms of closing smaller hospitals,
concentrating surgery capacity, etc., does not take place then the financial savings of the project are not
likely to occur.
The organization of Primary Health Care (PHC). An expansion of PHC would not automatically
lead to a reallocation of resources from hospitals. The incentives (pecuniary and non-pecuniary) given to
doctors as well as patients will be important for the development.

The net present value of the project financial flows is reduced to LVL 957,000 and expected internal
rate of return to 34 percent after ten years, still strongly supporting economic rationale for the Latvia
health reform program and the project.

Procurement Arrangements and Allocation of Loan Proceeds
A. Procurement Methods and Thresholds
Procurement of Works (US$2.7 Million): Civil works would be contracted in accordance with
the Bank's published Guidelines: Procurement under IBRD Loans and IDA Credits (January 1995,
revised January andAugust 1996, and September 1997), through National Competitive Bidding
procedures acceptable to the Bank, adapting the Bank's Standard Bidding Document for Small Works.
The Borrower has accepted and is currently utilizing the Standard NCB document for Small Works
developed by the ECA Region. Civil works under the project only include refurbishment for existing
facilities for central MOW facilities, health care facilities in the Project's Pilot area, and for the offices of
the Central Health Insurance Fund (SCHIF). It is expected that about 8 contracts would be awarded, not
exceeding US$500,000 each, and up to an aggregate of US$1.6 million, while the refurbishment of the
SCHIF building would be Government-financed.
Procurement of Goods (US$6.6 Million): Procurement of goods would be carried out in
accordance with the Bank's published Guidelines. Procurement under IBRD Loans and IDA Credits
(January 1995, revised January and August 1996, and September 1997). Goods to be financed under the
Loan include medical and office equipment and furniture, computer hardware and software, production
and dissemination of mass media materials, and vehicles. Contracts estimated to cost above US$300,000
would be procured through International Competitive Bidding (ICB) procedures (total aggregate amount
of US$4.6 Million). Contracts estimated to cost above US$75,000 but less than US$300,000 may be
procured through International Shopping (IS) procedures (total aggregate amount of US$0.6 million)
Contracts estimated to cost less than US$75,000 may be contracted through National Shopping (NS)
Procedures (total aggregate amount of US$ 1.1 million). Procurement of equipment for the SCHIF
(US$0.3 Million) would be Government-financed.
Procurement of Consulting Services and Training (US$7.7 Million): Services would be
carried out in accordance with the Bank's published Guidelines: Selection and Employment of
Consultants by World BankBorrowers (January 1997, revised September 1997). Services to be financed
under the Loan include consulting services; training courses 1, fellowships, and study tours; research
studies and surveys. The majority of Bank-financed contracts for technical assistance and training would
be awarded on the basis of Quality and Cost-Based Selection (QCBS) procedures (US$5.1 million).
Contracts under US$100,000 for training, fellowships, seminars, and study tours would be contracted
through Selection under Fixed Budget (SFB) procedures (US$0.3 million). Individual consultants
would be contracted in accordance with procedures for Selection under Consultant Qualifications
(SCQ) according to the Bank Guidelines (US$0.3 million). Included in the project are technical
assistance services financed through a grant from the Government of Sweden (Sida) for US$2.0 Million,
to be administered by the Client. Procurement of technical assistance under the Grant would also be
carried out according the Guidelines.
Except where such services would be procured as an integral part, and tightly related to the purposes of, a
Goods procurement, e.g., in Information Technology.

Brief statement
Responsibility for conducting all procurement under this Project will be within the MOW's PCU and its
procurement experts. Currently the PCU has two procurement experts, one responsible for procurement of
goods and works, and the second expert focusing on procurement of services and consultant contracts. The
Appraisal mission reviewed the existing capacity of the PCU to conduct procurement of works, goods, and
services under this project. The PCU is currently using the Bank's standard bidding documents, and the
Govemment accepts the use of the Bank's procurement Guidelines, and standard ICB and agreed NCB
documents are already in use. It is acknowledged that some improvements are needed, in particular,
procurement planning and contract management. Accordingly, the project envisages procurement training to be
financed both through the Loan and through a Sida Grant.
