I. Introduction

1.       This Project Paper seeks the approval o fthe Executive Directors to provide an additional
grant inan amount o fUS$1.6 million to the Bhutan Education Development Project (EDP),
(Credit 3820-BHU).

2.       The proposed additional grant would help finance costs associated with a financing gap
for the construction o f two additional schools, to bring the total number o f schools under the
project to 28, approximately the same as the project's original target o f 29.

3.       To address growing concerns over long construction times and scarcity o f materials used
intraditional constructionmethods (e.g., timber, stones), as usedunderprevious Bank-financed
school construction inBhutan, a newbuildingmethod using light gauge steel frame (LGSF)
technology has been introduced inthe buildingsector inBhutan for the first time underEDP.
While LGSFbuildingtechnology has beenusedextensively inother parts o f the world, this i s
the first time it is being usedinBhutan. Duringproject preparation, estimates were made o f
likely costs, although more accurate cost informationwas to be gained duringthe course o f
implementation. With approximately halfthe schools planned under the project now completed,
the project has more detailed cost estimates, resultingina downward revision to 26 from the
project's original target o f 29 new middle and higher secondary (some o f which have primary-
level classes).

4.       Additional financing will allow for the construction o f an additional two schools.
Additional classroomblocks at these and other schools beingconstructedunder the project will
allow the project to achieve its overall target o f an additional 10,000 student places at the
primary and secondary school levels.

5.       There are no multi-or bi-lateral agencies co-financing EDP.

11.      BackgroundandRationalefor AdditionalFinancinginthe amountof US$1.6million

6.       The original Credit amount for the EducationDevelopment Project was SDR 22.0 million
(US$31 million equivalent). The Credit was approved on August 23,2003, and the project was
declared effective on October 10, 2003.

7.       The project's original development objectives were to support Bhutan's five-year
education development program to expand access to primary and secondary education, and
improve educational quality at all levels. The overall scope o f the project i s to support the Royal
Government o f Bhutan (RGOB) inimplementation o f its gthFive-Year Plan (2002-2008), and
the continuation o f education sector development activities through the follow-on 1Oth Five-Year
Plan (2008-2013). The program i s underpinned by the education sector strategy for achieving
Bhutan's Vision 20/20 which provides a framework of development principles to improve quality
o f life o f its citizens and founded upon Bhutan's uniquedevelopment philosophy o f "Gross
National Happiness".

8.      EDPhas three components:

        (i) Expandaccesstoprimaryandsecondaryeducation;
        (ii)Improverelevanceandqualityofeducationatalllevels;and
        (iii)Institutionalstrengthening.

9.      There have been no changes to the original objectives, design or scope o f the project
since effectiveness, and the project i s expected to complete all activities and achieve its
development objectives by the planned closing date o f December 31,2009. Disbursement i s
currently 61 percent. The project underwent a mid-termreview inM a y 2007, and progress
toward achievement o f the Project Development Objectives (PDO) was judged to be satisfactory.
Ratings have remained satisfactory (either satisfactory or moderately satisfactory), with the
exception o f a moderately unsatisfactory rating for procurement inthe April 2007
Implementation Status Report following delays inthe supply o f steel which were deemed to be
largely beyond the control o f the Ministry o fEducation (MOE), the main implementing agency.
There i s substantial compliance with the Credit covenants. The current audit report for 2006-
2007 i s now overdue by over nine months. The delay is attributedlargely to the disruptions inthe
normal functioning o f the civil service duringthe runup to the country's first multi-party
elections. The task team has been incontact with RGOB counterparts to resolve this immediately
and an assurance has been obtained from RGoB that the audit report will be submitted before
end-April2008. The receipt o f the overdue audit report would however, be a caveat for this
proposal to be taken forward for submission to the Executive Board o f the World Bank.

10.     A special feature o fthe project is that inachieving the above goals, it also aims to address
the risingproblem o f youth unemployment through the training o f grade 10 school leavers in
LGSF assembly. LGSF-trained workers are later hiredby contractors for buildingthe schools
under the project. The move away from traditional labor-intensive and low technology building
approaches through the adoption o f LGSF provides an opportunity to shift mindsetso f youth
regarding employment inthe buildingsector, which, to date, has beenregardedas low status and
occupied mainly byunskilledmigrant labor from neighboring India.

11.     The introduction o fLGSFbuildingtechnology was done underEDPinthe absence o f
specific costs for this type o f construction inthe Bhutan context. While LGSF building
technology has been usedextensively inother parts o f the world, it had not been used inBhutan
prior to EDP.Duringproject preparation estimates were made o f likely costs, although more
accurate cost information to be determined as the school buildingprogram progressed. This has
ledto a downward revision o fthe project's original target to construct 29 middle andhigher
secondary schools to 26 schools. Additional financing will allow for an additional two schools,
bringingthe total to 28 schools to be built under the project.

12.     Two unforeseen events have impacted the project. First, a disruption inthe supply o f steel
occurred inmid-2006, which slowed implementation o f the project's school buildingprogram
for a period o f approximately 14 months. For carrying out school construction activities, the
project was reliant on a single steel supplier, who after the second cycle o f school construction
was determined to have supplied steel below specifications and, thereafter, ceased to provide
adequate supplies o f steel to allow for the smooth continuation o f the buildingprogram. The



                                                  2

MOEtook immediate remedial steps to addressthe situation, new suppliers were identified and
the supplyo f steel resumed. Second, aparticularly heavy and long-duration monsoon season in
2007 damaged a number o frural roads, thus impedingdelivery o f buildingmaterials to some
school construction sites inthe east and south o f the country.

13.     There are three maintypes o f cost escalation which have yielded a financing gap for
which addition financing i s sought:

    a. delays inthe school building program over a period o f approximately 14 months in2006-
        2007 due to unavailability o f steel at construction sites (i-e., as noted above, due to
        problems with the supplier and the heavy 2007 monsoon), raised the cost o f LGSF
        assembly contracts, particularly given that contractors were required to retain the services
        o f LGSF assembly-trained youth, who otherwise would have sought other employment
        andnot been available once the supply o f steel resumed;
    b. global steel prices have risen approximately 40 percent since project effectiveness due to
        highlevels o fconsumption, particularly inneighboringChina; and
    c. given Bhutan's mountainous and slide-prone terrain, additional site development has
        been requiredat some sites to install retaining walls and other land-slide preventative
        measures.

14.     From 400 students in 1960, Bhutan's education systemhas expanded to over 125,000
studentsat the primary, secondary and tertiary levels, comprising approximately one-fifth o f the
country's population. Successful expansion o fprimary enrollment over the past decade has
created enormous pressures, particularly at the secondary level (grades 9-12). Bhutan has
determined grade ten to be the final year o f the cycle o f `basic education' which all youth are
expected to attain. Secondary enrollment doubled inthe period 2002-2007, and this trend is
expected to continue.

15.     Bhutan has achieved the first MillenniumDevelopment Goal (MDG) education target to
attain 100percent gross primaryenrollment. All other MDG education targets, with the
exception o f that pertaining to female participation at the tertiary levels, are on-track to be
achieved. As with the primary school completion indicator, there have been similar
enhancements inthe secondary school completion rates from an annual average o f 65 percent in
2000 to 74 percent in2005. Since 1990, grade seven completion has increased from 35 to nearly
90 percent. This underscores the need for sufficient provision at the secondary level as increasing
numbersofchildrencomplete the fullprimary cycle. Enrolment at the secondary level has grown
rapidly with annual average increases o f 13 percent since 1995, and net secondary enrollment to
grade 10 i s now nearly 80 percent. The tertiary level target for increased gender parity can only
be achieved ifsufficient numbers o f girls complete the full secondary cycle. For this, the
provision o f an adequate number o f student places at the secondary level i s essential.

16.     The cost o f secondary school provision is relatively highas most secondary schools are
outside urban centers and require student hostels, plus additional structures such as kitchens,
teachers' quarters and washroomhathing facilities. Additional financing to EDP is required to
maximize the efforts currently underway to help Bhutan achieve its secondary level enrollment
targets and universalbasic education.

111.    ProposedChanges

 17.    There are no proposed changes to the project's development objective, design or scope.
The project is expected to achieve its original target o f an additional 10,000 student places (3,000
at the primary level, and 7,000 at the secondary level), despite a reduction inthe total number of
schools to bebuilt, given that additional classroomblocks have either been constructedor are
plannedat a numbero f schools built under the project.

 18.    Implementation arrangements will remain the same with the MOE as the main
implementing agency, and the School Planning andBuildingDivision (SPBD) responsible for
managing the school construction component. No change to the Credit Closing Date i s planned.

 19.    Delayed completion o f schools under the second and third cycles o f school construction
(five schools per cycle) was the result o f a disruption insteel supplies. However, there have been
general delays o f approximately three to six months at all sites. As the project i s scheduled to
close inDecember 2009, a recent supervision mission held inFebruary 2008, specifically to
examine the school construction schedule, agreed with the School Planning and Building
Divisionthat it will closely monitor construction works toward completion within the project
period. It was also agreed that a revised work-plan, factoring inthe delays that have occurred so
far, will be ready for the next full supervision mission, scheduled for early-May 2008.

IV.     Consistencywith the CountryAssistance Strategy(CAS)

20.     The EducationDevelopment Project was determined to be fully consistent with the CAS
ineffect at appraisal. Since project effectiveness, anew CAS hasbeenpreparedandis ineffect.
EDP continues to be wholly consistent with the CAS, which has as one o fits three pillars the aim
to `expand access to better infrastructure, improve access and quality o f social services, and
connect communities to markets'. A second CAS pillar i s to `promote private sector
development and employment; EDP i s consistent with this pillar given the project's aim to train
out-of-school youth ina new buildingtechnology and shift mindsets among youth toward
employment inthe buildingindustry. Finally, the CAS places strong emphasis on sound
environmental management as a cross-cutting theme, toward which EDP's use o f LGSF
construction technology is consistent as it aims to reduce reliance on stones and timber for
school construction.

V.      GovernanceandAnti-CorruptionMeasures

21.     On December 31,2005, H i s Majesty the Fourth King decreed that an Anti-Corruption
Commission (ACC) be established. The ACC currently has a staff o f 27, having recently hired
nineadditional staffto manage an increasing caseload. As parliamentary democracy is being
introduced inthe country, the Anti-Corruption Commission i s seen as a key institution for the
proper functioning o f democracy, and in-linewith other measure to ensure good governance.

22.     Corruption complaints are addressed internally by the MOE, as evidenced this year with a
thorough investigation into science equipment procurement. MOE formed ajoint verification
team and a ministerial investigation committee investigated embezzlement o fNu 13m inthe
purchase o f science and lab equipment. The investigation was carried out incollaboration with
the RoyalAudit Authority o f Bhutan and received extensive press coverage M O E forwarded the
case to the Office o f the Attorney General through the cabinet secretariat for further action (Le.
criminal prosecution)

23.     Under the IDA-financed Education Development Project, it has been suspected that the
supplier o f steel for the construction o f schools engaged infraud bypurposefully bidding at a
low price with the intention of later supplying lower quality materials. The M O E has reported the
case to the Anti-Corruption Commissionwhich i s investigating the case and will possibly
blacklist the supplier.

VI.     EconomicAnalysis of Cost Overrunor FinancingGap

24.     The economic analysis carried out at preparation focused on secondary/higher education,
and examined the demand and supply for skills and demand-supply mismatches. A cost-benefit
analysis was also carried out to quantify the rate o f returnon the project. The cost-benefit
analysis assumed that the project would lead to both higher internal efficiency o f the system, as
well as higher external efficiency through making school leavers more marketable. The project's
expected economic rate o f returno f 14 percent calculated at appraisal is anticipated to remain the
same with the introduction o f additional financing.

VII.    ExpectedOutcomes

25.     The proposed additional grant would help finance costs associated with a financing gap
for the construction o f two additional schools, to bringthe total number o f schools under the
project to 28, approximately the same as the project's original target o f 29.

VIII. Benefitsand Risks

26.     Additional financing to EDP i s beneficial inthat it will bringthe project close to its
original target o f constructing 29 new secondary schools, yet adhering to the overall target
number of additional student places. Itwill also ensure that, through the construction o ftwo
additional schools, there will be continued employment for youth trained inLGSF assembly, and
for whom there i s no guarantee o f employment inLGSFbuildingonce the project i s completed
(although it is hoped that LGSF technology will be adopted by other sectors inBhutan,following
the example and experience o f EDP).

27.     There are no new risks to be identified as a function of additional financing being made
available, since the project's development objectives and implementation arrangements remain
the same as at the time o f appraisal.

IX.     FinancialTerms andConditionsfor the AdditionalFinancing

28.     The sole financial term whichis differentunder the proposed additional financing is that
the additional amount o f US$1.6 million will be made available to RGOB on 100percent grant
terms for IDA.Per the IDA 14 assessment for Bhutan, the country is eligible for 100percent
grant financing given its highlevel o f indebtednessassociated with large-scale borrowing,
mostly from neighboring India, to finance a large hydro-power project. Bhutan's debt profile is
expected to change as the new power generation facility which has been commissioned starts
generating domestic revenues for the country.

29.     The project's financial management arrangements will otherwise remain unchanged. The
existing financial management arrangements for the project with some enhancements are
considered as adequate and capable o f providing the Bank and the RGOBwith accurate and
timely information on the status o fthe project and the use o fBank funds. The enhancements are
primarily aimed at streamlining the financial management arrangements andaligning the same
with the country systems.

30.     The key changes being proposedinclude: (a) project hnds will be depositedinadvance
into the designated account maintained inNgultrums, to be opened at the Bank o f Bhutan; and
(b) replenishments into the designated account will bebased on interim unauditedfinancial
reports andwill be processed by Department o f Public Accounts on a quarterly basis. The
interimunaudited financial reportswill provide information on expendituremade inthe previous
quarter and forecast for two subsequent quarters. Quarterly disbursements would be made based
on these financial reports, providing funds for two subsequent quarters after adjustment for past
disbursements.

                        Annex 1: FinancialManagementArrangements
            BHUTAN: AdditionalFinancingfor EducationDevelopmentProject

Introduction

1.      The Education Development Project with the original Credit allocation o f US$31million
was approvedon August 23,2003 and the project was declared effective on October 10,2003.
There have beenno changes to the original objectives, design or scope o f the project since
effectiveness and the project i s expected to complete all activities and achieve its development
objectives by the planned closing date o fDecember 31,2009. Disbursementis currently 61
percent. The project underwent a mid-term review inMay 2007, and financial management
perfonnance has beenrated as 'Moderately Satisfactory'.

2.      An additional grant o fUS$1.6 million is presently beingsought to help finance costs
associated with a financing gap for the construction o ftwo additional schools. Implementation
arrangements will remain the same with the MOE as the main implementingagency, and the
SPBD responsible for the school construction component.

3 .     This assessment o f financial management arrangements has beenundertaken in
accordance with OP/BP 10.02 and the Financial Management Practices inWorld Bank financed
Investment Operations -Manual, November 2005 and has been undertaken with a view to
determining the adequacy o f the financial management arrangements at the MOE, RGOB to
provide assurance that the proceeds o f the loan are usedfor the purposes for which the loan was
granted.

Key LearningfromImplementationExperiencesof EDP

4.      The financial management arrangements for the project have beenby and large,
considered satisfactory. MOE has made considerable efforts, assisted by the Bank's task team to
improve the quality and timeliness o f quarterly interim unaudited financial reports (IUFR) and
these are considered acceptable. The IUFRs are based on BAS generated reports and help
enhance the level o f reliability and correctness o f the reports.

5.      Based on the lessons emerging from EDP experience, the following issues were
examined further during this appraisal to assess their impact on the financial arrangements
   .
designed for this project.

        RGOB's FinancialRules & Regulations require that all expenditures incurredunder
        externally funded operations are pre-financed from the Special Account (or Designated
        Account) for the project. The Special Account has been untilrecently, operated by the
        Department o f Aid & Debt Management (DADM),now mergedinto the Department o f
        Public Accounts, and i s maintained inUS$. Thus for all project related expenditures, a
        two step process is followed: (1) PMU sends fundrequests to DADM,who withdraws the
        Ngultrumequivalent amount from the Special Account and transfers the same to the
        General BudgetFundAccount; and (2) On confirmation o fthe deposit inthe GBLF,



                                                  7

 DPAreleases the funds to the PLC Account o fthe PMU. This essentially means that the
 project staff needs to keep close track o f the exchange rates for each transaction and
 ensure that the same exchange rates are used to report the actual expenditures inthe
 Statements o f Expenditures (SOE). This i s a fairly laborious method and requires
 considerable time and effort o f the accounting staff. Insubsequentprojects (RAP2), it has
 been agreed with RGOB that the DesignatedAccount be maintained inNgultrumthus
.eliminating the need to make transaction level currency exchanges.

 The SOE method o f disbursementrequires the P M Uto follow a separate track o f
 reporting for the project expenditures at the transaction level. This manner o f reporting
 runsinparallel to the standard accounting andreportingprocesses o fproject
 expenditures, as inBAS, Bhutan's own computerized Budget & Accounting System).
 With no inbuiltinternal control measures for reconciliation o f expenditures reportedin
 the SOE and the IUFRs(based on BAS reports), the exposure to risk that the
 expenditures reportedmay not be correct or reliable remains high.New initiatives taken
 bythe World Bank and RGOB to move towards report-based disbursements inall new
 Bank financed operations has helpedeliminate or mitigate this risk substantively. This
 also helps inmoving forward the agenda on use o f country systems.

 Replenishment o f the Special Account i s often affected by delays insubmitting
 withdrawal applications because the time taken by the P M Uto prepare the SOEs or the
 P M Uproviding the DADMwith inadequate or incorrect information, which needs
 several corrections. Inaddition, irregular submission o f the bills by the contractors often
 results inlumpiness o fpayments. As a result, the Special Account would be exhausted.
 Disbursementsbased on IUFRswill allow the quantum o f the advance to beresponsive to
.fundrequirements.

 Issues on the quality and timeliness inthe submission o f IUFRshave been noted - IUFRs
 for the quarter ended 31December 2007 have been submittedinApril 2008. Inorder to
 ensure the correctness and timeliness o f the IUFRs,the World Bank task team has been
 working alongside with the accounting staff o fthe P M Uoften providinghandholding
.support inthe preparation o f the IUFRs.

 Timely submission o f audit reports has beenan area o fconcern inBhutan.The current
 audit report for 2006-2007 i s now overdue by over ninemonths. Inthis case, however,
 the delay is attributed largely to disruptions inthe normal functioning o fthe civil service
 duringthe runup to the country's first multi-party elections. The task team has beenin
 contact with RGOB counterparts to resolve this immediately and an assurance has been
 obtained from RGOBthat the audit report will be submittedbefore end-April2008. The
 receipt o f the overdue audit report would however, be a caveat for this proposal to be
.taken forward for submission to the Executive Board o f the World Bank.

 Slow progress has beenmade inthe implementation o frecommendations made by the
 Bank implementation support missions with respect to: (a) accounting for innovation
 grants; and (b) maintaining commitment tracking records. These measures are aimed at
 strengtheningthe financial management processes at the project level.

  Adequacyof FMArrangements

  6.      The existing financial management arrangements for the project with some enhancements
  may be considered as adequate and capable o fproviding the Bank and the RGOBwith accurate
  and timely information on the status o f the project andthe use o f Bank funds. The enhancements
  are primarily aimed at streamlining the financial management arrangements and aligning the
  same with the country systems.

  7.      The key changes beingproposed include (a) Project funds will be deposited inadvance
  into the designated account maintained inNgultrums, to be opened at the Bank o f Bhutan; and
  (b) replenishments into the designated account will bebased on IWRs and will beprocessedby
  D P A on a quarterly basis. The IUFRswill provide information on expenditure made inthe
  previous quarter and forecast for two subsequentquarters. Quarterly disbursements would be
  made based on these financial reports, providing funds for two subsequent quarters after
  adjustment for past disbursements.

  8.      There have been delays inthe submission o f audit reports for 2006-2007 owing mainly to
  disruptions inthe normal functioning o f the civil service duringthe runup to the country's first
  multi-party elections. The latest overdue audit report was received inApril, 2008.

  9.      The FMrisk rating for the supplemental project i s currently rated as Modest, which will
  bereviewed and revisedas needed duringperiodic missions.
