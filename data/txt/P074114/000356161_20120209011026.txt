1. Project Context, Development Objectives and Design

1.1 Context at Appraisal

1.     Bhutan has a far-reaching development approach based on strategies articulated in
successive five-year plans centered on the overarching goal of increasing people’s “Gross
National Happiness? (GNH). Since the late 1950s when the first non-monastic schools
were established, the country has progressively established and expanded a system of
public education characterized by free access and merit-based promotion. The World
Bank accompanied Bhutan in this endeavor from the beginning of the Sixth Five-Year
Plan (FY88-92) by supporting a series of three education projects, of which the Education
Development Project (EDP) is the third1.

2.     At the start of the first IDA education investment in Bhutan in 1988, the Primary
Education Project, 57,000 students were enrolled in 190 schools and institutions. At EDP
appraisal, enrollment had grown to 125,000 students at the primary and secondary
education levels in 408 schools, and 2000 students at the tertiary level in nine institutes of
higher education. The primary school gross and net enrollment rates were 81 and 61
percent, respectively (2002). Girls’ participation was an impressive 47 percent.

3.      Rapid enrollment increases at the primary level placed considerable pressure on
the education system, especially at secondary level, as increasing numbers of students
completed the full primary school cycle to the end of grade 6. At EDP appraisal,
projected enrollment increases over the period 2002-2007 were more than 20,000
students for grades PP (kindergarten) to grade 6; 15,000 for grades 7-10; and 5,000 for
grades 11-12. Expanding intake capacity would stretch domestic resources. Unit costs for
school construction were high because of the country’s difficult mountainous terrain and
the remoteness of many settlements. Unit costs for learning materials were also high
since the major portion was imported from India and had to be transported to interior
regions of Bhutan. The quality of education was a concern, despite significant initiatives
taken prior to EDP. Only 71 percent of those entering primary school completed the full
seven-year cycle; 13 percent of students repeated grades every year; students’
performance in public examinations was showing a decline in learning outcomes; and
employers were questioning the responsiveness of secondary and higher education to
labor market demands.

4.     The Royal Government of Bhutan’s (RGOB) Ninth Five-Year Plan (9FYP; 2002-
2007) placed a high priority on the education sector. The issue of access featured strongly
given the need to absorb the increasing number of students completing the full primary

  The first Primary Education Project, effective September 6, 1988, became the first social sector
investment financed by IDA in Bhutan.



                                                1
schooling cycle and following on from Bhutan’s concerted efforts to attain global
“universal primary enrolment? and “education for all? targets. Second, the issues of
education quality featured prominently, in line with earlier reform initiatives to improve
the quality of teaching-learning, including the “New Approach to Primary Education? in
the late 1980s. The 9FYP set the following goals:

   Increase basic education from grade 8, to grade 10;
   Enhance the quality of education to achieve competency in language, communication
    skills including ICT, and Mathematics comparable to international standards;
   Increase the proportion of students promoted from grade 10 to 12, from 38 percent to
    56 percent;
   Develop a higher education system under the umbrella of a national university with
    federated colleges responsive to the needs of society and the economy;
   Strengthen and improve pre-service and in-service teacher education to meet the
    challenges of a rapidly growing education system;
   Strengthen institutions and human resource capacities at all levels for improved
    education management and planning (school, gewog, dzongkhag, central ministry);
   Enhance the literacy rate from 54 percent to 80 percent.

5.      In the early 1990s the Royal Government determined that there was a need
quickly to expand the number of student places at the secondary level. Traditional
approaches to school building using large quantities of stone and timber, along with labor
intensive construction techniques which necessitated large numbers of un- and semi-
skilled workers from neighboring India, were seen as inadequate to meet the need for a
significant number of new and upgraded schools, particularly at the middle and higher
secondary levels. The ambitious targets the RGOB set for its 9FYP could not be achieved
by continuing with conventional methods of construction, compounded by concerns over
the impact on the environment from the extraction of stones and timber. A major shift in
the approach was deemed necessary, and this became a primary focus of the EDP.

6.      In view of the substantial financing needs for achieving the 9FYP goals in the
education sector, the RGOB: (i) earmarked 15 percent of the Plan’s budget for education,
to enable education spending to increase by 50 percent in real terms by 2008-2009; and
(ii) developed a program framework to coordinate assistance from different sources. The
economy was expanding at a growth rate of about six percent per annum, but the Royal
Government still needed external financing to meet its development goals for the
education sector. The World Bank’s support was sought through the EDP to: (i)
consolidate gains from IDA’s previous two specific investments in the education sector,
particularly to increase the sector’s intake capacity to accommodate growing demand; (ii)
address the link between education and the labor market for enhanced labor productivity;
and (iii) scale up and catalyze initiatives which had the potential for yielding the greatest
impact on learning outcomes.

1.2 Original Project Development Objectives (PDO) and Key Indicators

7.       The overall program objective stated in the PAD was to support Bhutan's
education development program under its 9FYP to expand access to primary and
secondary education, and improve educational quality at all levels. The PDO was stated
in a slightly enhanced version in the DCA: The objectives of the Project are: (a) to assist
in the implementation of the education development program in the Ninth Five-Year
Plan; and (b) to that end, to expand access to primary and secondary education and to
improve the quality and relevance of education at all levels. The outcome indicators
selected to monitor the project and evaluate its achievements are in the ICR DataSheet.

1.3 Revised PDO (as approved by original approving authority) and Key Indicators,
and reasons/justification
N/A

1.4 Main Beneficiaries

8.     The IDA PAD identified the primary beneficiaries as:
 10,000 additional children in the primary and secondary school age cohorts who will
   have schooling places; many from rural and/or isolated settlements;
 all primary and secondary students in the country benefiting from quality
   enhancement initiatives; and
 200 school leavers, plus additional technical and engineering professionals in the
   Royal Government and private sector who would benefit from training in the use of
   light gauge steel frame (LGSF) building technology introduced for the first time into
   the Bhutanese construction sector under EDP.

9.     The secondary beneficiaries of the project were employers who were expected to
be able to access a higher quality labor pool as a result of quality improvements in
secondary and tertiary programs. The country at large was to benefit from an education
system that would be more demand-driven and relevant to labor market needs.

1.5 Original Components (as approved)

10.    The project was divided into three main components and had a total of ten sub-
components. Component 1, the school building program, was by far the largest
investment area under EDP, with nearly three-quarters of the project’s estimated
financing allocated to school construction at appraisal:

Component 1: Expand access to primary and secondary education. One of the key
project objectives was to create 3,000 additional places at the primary level and 7,000
places at the secondary level. This was to be achieved through:

(i) Construction of 29 schools, of which, according to the DCA, four were to be new
    secondary schools, and 25 upgraded/extended primary and secondary schools;


                                            3
(ii) Construction of a warehouse for storage of LGSF construction materials; and
(iii)Provision of institution-based and on-site training in LGSF technology to school
     leavers, the School Planning and Building Division (SPBD), and local contractors.

Toward the end of the preceding IDA project, the Second Education Project, a pilot
financed by the Government of Denmark in use of LGSF building technology had been
started at one school and accepted by the MOE. In view of the wider scale application of
this new technology under EDP, it was deemed critical to build up capacity at various
levels, including in the School Planning and Building Division (SPBD) of the MOE and
among local construction contractors. Adoption of the LGSF technology under EDP was
also expected to promote the construction sector as a viable means of employment for the
increasing number of Bhutanese youth entering the labor market. It was hoped that a
modern and technologically sophisticated construction technology such as the LGSF
would appeal to Bhutanese school leavers.

Component 2: Improve quality and relevance of education at all levels. This supported
the continuing drive for improved quality of education that was a priority under the 9FYP.
The first three sub-components focused on primary and secondary education, and the
fourth on the Royal University of Bhutan (RUB). The component aimed to:

(i) Enhance effectiveness of teaching and learning through (a) revision of the
     mathematics curriculum; (b) expansion of the school library development and
     supplementary reading programs to about 300 primary and secondary schools; and (c)
     establishment of about 15 additional resource centers (supplementing those financed
     under the previous IDA-financed education project and UNICEF), to support clusters
     of nearby schools, particularly in remote areas;
(ii) Finance innovation grants, to assist selected primary and secondary schools in
     carrying out locally designed, school-based quality enhancement schemes;
(iii)Expand the existing IT education program for middle and higher secondary schools
     by: (a) implementing a newly developed IT curriculum; and (b) developing a small
     cadre of IT specialists to spearhead wider application of IT education;
(iv) Establish a secretariat in line with the master plan for the Royal University of Bhutan
     (RUB), to create a nodal point for academic programming and quality control within
     a new, federated system of colleges and other tertiary level institutions. The two
     interventions were: constructing and equipping a new building to house the offices of
     the RUB Vice Chancellor, Registrar, and other core offices; and providing technical
     assistance for preparing the University’s strategic development and funding plans.

Component 3: Institutional strengthening. This component focused on two key inputs:
(i) human resource development (HRD) and (ii) upgrading physical capacities. HRD was
critical for enhancing the MOE’s planning, management, leadership, and monitoring and
evaluation (M&E) systems. EDP was to finance: (i) fellowships to MOE staff for further
studies in their professional fields; (ii) training to dzongkhag (District) Education
Officers; and (iii) scholarships for graduate studies in English and Mathematics for
selected teachers. For the M&E, there was support for (i) improving and institutionalizing


                                             4
tools for measuring learning achievement; (ii) developing new instruments to assess the
relevance of education/training to labor needs; and (iii) conducting targeted studies
particularly for providing feedback on promising approaches for improved teaching-
learning. The second input, physical infrastructure, addressed constraints within MOE
and at dzongkhag levels. EDP was to construct: (i) a new complex to house all MOE staff
at one location to improve coordination and administrative efficiency; and (ii) new
education stores to address inefficiencies in storage and distribution of learning materials.

1.6 Revised Components
There was no change in the agreed components during the lifetime of the Project.

1.7 Other significant changes

11.    Four significant changes were made during implementation:

(i) Scaling up with additional financing: IDA Grant H374-BT was approved on July 15,
    2008 in the amount of SDR 980,000 (US$1.6 million at the time of signing). This was
    motivated by a cost increase in the school building program assessed at that time to
    be 40 percent over the estimate at appraisal, and to utilize effectively an additional
    IDA allocation to Bhutan available toward the end of the IDA 14 cycle.

(ii) Change in target number of schools: The number of schools was changed from that in
     the DCA, and there were site changes from the initial Project Implementation Plan
     (PIP). The changes were to adjust to a shift in RGOB priorities, not foreseen at
     preparation, to develop regional clusters of schools to accommodate more efficiently
     the increasing student enrollment at the secondary level. The project built nine new
     middle (MSS) and higher secondary (HSS) schools, compared to the PIP’s provision
     of two new schools at these levels, and expanded/upgraded four lower secondary
     (LSS) and 15 MSS and HSS. This increase in the number of new schools beyond the
     PIP’s initial provision required additional expenditure on account of site development
     works, boarding facilities, and the costlier requirements of science and computer
     laboratories at the higher grade levels.

(iii)An extension of the project closing date until June 30, 2011 was approved in April
     2010, in order to complete work at six sites where school construction was delayed.

(iv) Decision to drop construction of the MOE complex: The construction could not be
     realized due to a change in RGOB’s plan to include the MOE Secretariat within a
     larger development scheme to house ten ministries. This implied a 300 percent
     increase in cost compared to what had been allocated for the MOE construction under
     EDP, as well as concerns over the viability of the larger scheme on both technical and
     financing grounds.

2. Key Factors Affecting Implementation and Outcomes

2.1 Project Preparation, Design and Quality at Entry

12.     The overall objectives in the project design were broad but consistent with the
sector issues identified in the 9FYP. This reflected the RGOB’s leading role at project
preparation and design stage, and implementation readiness. EDP encompassed the
development objectives of the national education framework described in the 9FYP; what
was needed was financial and technical support for implementation. The PAD was
prepared in line with these objectives. Key Performance Indicators were chosen to
evaluate the project’s progress and results in terms of both broad development in the
education sector, such as net and gross enrollment rates, as well as more programmatic
outputs such as progress in introducing IT education in secondary schools. EDP spanned
two five-year plan periods (9FYP and 10FYP), and was consistent with the access,
quality and institutional strengthening goals of both.

13.     Lessons taken into account: The EDP was designed to build on the two previous
IDA-financed projects such that the series of investments would help maintain consistent
growth in the education sector and, more specifically, ensure access at each subsequent
level of education from primary to higher secondary. The previous IDA-financed projects
supported education sector development, including strengthening capacity of its human
resource base, for the sector’s eventual bifurcation from the Ministry of Health and
Education in 2003, and establishment of the RUB that same year. Lessons from the
previous IDA-financed operations and international experience were incorporated into
EDP’s design, including curriculum reform, incentive grants to schools, and the critical
importance of M&E for gauging progress and impact of investments in the education
system. A key lesson accounted for in EDP’s design was the need for MOE to establish
accountability among its full time staff to coordinate, manage, and deliver EDP.
However, school construction delays encountered in the previous projects suggest it
would have been prudent to include more modest disbursement projections for the first
two years of EDP, particularly as EDP was introducing the new LGSF technology.

14.     Needs assessments and risks: The PAD was prepared in consultation with
stakeholders’ assessments and benefited from needs assessments which helped to discern
potential risks to implementation. It identified a number of risks, with an overall rating of
“modest.? Two were rated “substantial,? viz. the risks that (i) human resource capacity
might not be ensured at an early stage and (ii) it might prove too difficult for Bhutan’s
implementation and construction capacity to manage the increased size and complexity of
EDP’s school building program. The apparent success of MOE’s initial stages of piloting
LGSF technology at one school was a first important step toward transition to the use of
the technology under EDP. Nonetheless, with the move from building to manufacturing
(which was the critical shift under EDP), it was clear there was a significant lack of
knowledge and experience with LGSF technology at all levels in Bhutan’s construction
sector, from design to supervision to construction. Capacity building during the first



                                             6
phase of implementation was seen as critical, and the preparation process further had the
foresight to require in-country training of contractors as a pre-requisite to bidding.

2.2 Implementation

15.     The project was not rated as a problem project at any point in its implementation
period.

16.     The main factor that contributed to successful implementation was the MOE’s
dedication to deliver, supported by regular monitoring of the Bank task team. EDP was
fully integrated into the regular structures and functioning of the MOE with no separate
project implementation unit established to manage the project. Line directors had
responsibilities for specific sub-components. The school construction program was
executed by the SPBD. Overall coordination was carried out by the Policy and Planning
Division under the supervision of the Education Secretary.

17.      Project implementation experienced some challenges in the first three years.
Although experienced in building schools, and the LGSF approach was proposed by
SPBD’s lead architect, SPBD stepped into managing a greatly expanded program with a
major technological innovation. As opposed to utilizing a traditional project cycle starting
with design to bidding to implementation, a new component i.e. LGSF training had to be
introduced to address the lack of knowledge base within the industry. Start-up difficulties
included some unanticipated (longer) initial worker training in LGSF technology,
resulting in the first year of implementation being earmarked for capacity building before
construction could start. This led to slower than projected disbursements at the start of the
project and raised concern by Bank management. However, once sufficient LGSF
knowledge and technical capacity were in place to start construction of the first batch of
schools, SPBD was able to expedite the school building program, even with additional
facilities (e.g. dormitories, classroom blocks) at some sites. The original disbursement
projections were regained by FY10.

18.      The conversion of design to use LGSF was carried out by SPBD with technical
assistance from a specialist from a renowned technical and training institute, TAFE
Australia. An independent technical review conducted by SPBD on completion of the
first pilot school pointed out a number of design deficiencies, particularly concerning
seismic detailing. Modifications were subsequently included in the EDP school designs.

19.  Significant factors which affected implementation and were largely outside the
RGOB and/or implementing agency’s control were:

(i) Dependency on import of construction materials: In the region, a sudden demand for
    steel increased its market price. This was largely attributed to high demand for Asia-
    sourced steel for the Beijing Olympics. Consequently, this was a factor in the overall
    escalation of EDP’s costs for the school building program, by 40 percent, compared



                                             7
     with estimated allocations at appraisal. (Other factors in the cost increase were
     associated with expansion in the school building program during implementation.)
(ii) Natural disasters: Heavy monsoons during summer seasons and cold winters affected
     the workflow. Monsoons affected timely supply of materials, particularly steel, to
     construction sites. Cold winter weather hampered labor retention at some work sites,
     especially in northern and high altitude parts of Bhutan. Bhutan’s mountainous terrain,
     fragile road networks, flooding and landslides caused further construction delays. In
     early 2007, supplies were not reaching Bhutan following the collapse of a major
     bridge on the land route between Kolkata port and Phuentsholing.
(iii)Shortage of skilled labor: RGOB restrictions on the issuance of work permits for
     foreign (i.e. Indian) laborers hindered the smooth execution of the school building
     program. The remoteness of some school construction sites affected labor retention.

20.     Other than for school construction, none of the MOE staff – including the EDP
project coordinator in the Policy and Planning Division - was solely earmarked for the
EDP. This meant its deliverables could not always be the top priority when other
responsibilities intervened. An additional factor affecting implementation was the MOE’s
human resource development program, to which the EDP contributed significantly with
scholarships for ex-country training. Some staff who would have been best suited to
manage specific project interventions at critical points were absent for extended periods.
While RGOB stood to gain long-term benefits from this human resource upgrading, this
posed short-term constraints for the smooth implementation of EDP.

21.     The Mid-Term Review of the project assessed that the appraisal had under-
estimated financing requirements for the school building program, and had been unable
to account for unforeseen circumstances regarding steel supply. This led to a requirement
for additional IDA financing for EDP.

2.3 Monitoring and Evaluation (M&E) Design, Implementation and Utilization
22.   The ICR rates this overall as Moderately Satisfactory.

23.      M&E Design. Use of the Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) in the Results
Framework of the PAD would provide evidence of progress toward achieving the PDO,
although both the number and scope of the KPIs were ambitious. Not all KPIs were
included in regular ISR updates. The span of the KPIs – across the entire education sector
– was disproportionate to the main focus of the IDA investment. This may be justified by
the fact that project interventions, outside construction, were meant to be catalytic for
wider developments across the education sector within the framework of the 9FYP.
Counterpart financing, including staff time, was not quantified, although the policy of the
Royal Government is to finance capital costs using external resources and to finance
recurrent costs with domestic resources. Even though there is not a one-to-one link
between KPIs and specific outputs of the project, the indicators were designed to include
some which were more process-oriented. This is particularly the case for Component 3,
institutional strengthening.



                                             8
24.     M&E implementation and utilization. RGOB and Bank teams fully utilized
periodically collected data to monitor progress of the project and progress toward
achievement of the 9FYP goals. The EDP-supported Education Monitoring and
Assessment Guidelines (2003; revised ongoing) for MOE, dzongkhag officers and school
heads consolidated MOE’s data collection into a more coherent system. One principal
benefit was the streamlining of Annual Education Statistical Reports, which the MOE has
produced regularly since the late 1980s. Through periodic critical assessments of M&E
capacity and data reliability over EDP’s implementation (including the 2006 Quality of
Supervision evaluation by IDA), data collection and analysis have progressively
improved to the extent that administrative data from Bhutan’s education sector is
comparatively more reliable than many other countries at similar stages of development.

25.    EDP’s provisions for impact studies on interventions to improve education quality
and for a tracer study of school graduates entering the labor market could have more
vigorously enhanced MOE’s M&E capacities to consolidate qualitative and statistical
analysis, as well as to provide feedback into processes of curriculum development, school
planning and management. Instead, the various surveys and analytical work under EDP
were the responsibility of MOE line divisions. This lack of centralized planning and
implementation of analytical work resulted in a number of studies not being carried out.

2.4 Safeguard and Fiduciary Compliance
26.    The ICR rates this overall as Moderately Satisfactory.

27.     Safeguard compliance of the project is rated as Satisfactory. The project was a
Category B for environmental safeguards, and also triggered the safeguard on Indigenous
Peoples. Throughout project supervision, the Bank team consistently rated these two
aspects as “satisfactory.? Site visits to schools for the ICR found some areas for
improvement. These most typically related to inadequate water and sanitation facilities,
notably pertaining to maintenance. For example, the use of PVC piping for water systems
and sewage, which is the common standard in Bhutan modeled on Indian construction
practices, may be inappropriate for Bhutanese schools due to its low strength and
problems of cracking in cold temperatures. This is turning out to be a constant
maintenance issue for schools.

28.     Fiduciary compliance is rated as Moderately Satisfactory. This is consistent with
supervision assessments over two-thirds of the project lifetime. This is further justified on
the basis that the project agreement called for a separate finance officer dedicated to EDP,
but in reality the MOE Finance Officer carried out regular administrative duties in
addition to EDP. There were periodic delays in submission of financial reports, resulting
in late submission of audit reports. In the first half of the project, it was challenging to
manage EDP’s two Special Accounts against the need to incur very large expenditures
for school construction. There were procedural delays in reimbursement until a decision
was made at the MTR to merge the accounts and increase the overall allocation level.




                                             9
29.     Procurement is rated by the ICR as Moderately Satisfactory. This is justified on
several grounds. First, no issues were found during procurement post reviews or ex post
audits over the duration of the project. Second, the procurement capacity assessment at
appraisal judged that the MOE had built up significant experience under the previous
IDA-financed projects. Consequently, procurement thresholds were raised for EDP.
Given the size of procurement activities under EDP, the procurement capacity assessment
recommended increasing the number of procurement technicians. RGOB agreed to add
an Assistant Procurement Officer before Credit effectiveness. The capacity of staff was
enhanced through training. Third, there was a systematic plan for handling the LGSF
procurement which accounted for a different approach to packaging and phasing of
procurement for the phase-wise construction of schools using new materials. This called
for: (i) procurement of major materials centrally and (ii) bifurcation of the school
building program into three main components for procurement purposes (i.e. site
clearance, assembly works and supplies).

30. Despite the commendable performance above, the ICR does not judge that a fully
satisfactory rating is merited for procurement management for the following reasons: (i)
it was difficult for MOE to maintain consistently satisfactory procurement capacity; there
were frequent changes in staff over the lifetime of the project, and many of the new
arrivals were not familiar with IDA procurement guidelines and procedures, leading to
delays in processing; and (ii) procurement issues were responsible for delays in the
school construction program.

31.     Disbursements. Reviews by the project’s periodic implementation support visits
noted that bills received and paid through the office of the Chief Administrative Officer
were processed within a week, whereas it took a longer time to process payments through
the Administration, and Finance Division (AFD). The main explanatory factor is the
processing time required for AFD to obtain funds from the Ministry of Finance (MOF),
linked to high-value contracts for the school building program. Each time a bill was
submitted for payment, AFD had to obtain funds from MOF. Disbursements picked up in
the fourth quarter of 2009 and rose impressively, exceeding forecasts through until the
end of the project.

32.     The project disbursed 100 percent of the original Credit 3820-BHU of SDR 22
million as well as 100 percent of the IDA Grant H374-BT of SDR 980,000 (equivalent to
US$31 million and US$1.6 million, respectively, at time of signing). Taking into account
exchange rate gains from a weakened dollar versus SDR, the historical amount disbursed
by the project was a total US$35.68 million.

2.5 Post-completion Operation/Next Phase

33.    RGOB is maintaining EDP investments after project closure and refining reforms
begun during the project’s lifetime. This is seen, for example, in the performance
management system (including “performance contracts? and self-assessment tools) taking
deeper root at all levels of administration, from central to school levels, and throughout


                                           10
the tertiary sub-sector. Significant new developments are the recent designations of the
Royal University of Bhutan and the Bhutan Board of Examinations (now the Bhutan
Council for School Examinations and Assessment) into autonomous agencies. Each is
extending its core mandate, staffing up, and is accountable to a greater degree for its own
fund-raising. Given the relatively small size of the IDA envelope for Bhutan and the fact
that the education sector received the largest portion of IDA financing for most of the last
three decades, and that most IDA lending is now in the form of Development Policy
Credits (budget support), RGOB has decided not to use IDA financing for education
sector development under the new Country Partnership Strategy for FY11-14. Capacity
remains a major issue constraining RGOB’s development efforts, and the Bank continues
to play its role as “knowledge bank? for education through analytical and advisory
activities, including a public expenditure review and a policy note on higher education
reform with emphasis on quality assurance and development of a tertiary level
accreditation framework.

3. Assessment of Outcomes

3.1 Relevance of Objectives, Design and Implementation
34.     The overall relevance of the project objective, design and implementation is rated
as Significant.
 Alignment with development strategy: EDP was fully in line with RGOB’s
    development strategy defined by the 9FYP and 10FYP. MOE is applying experiences
    gained under EDP in proposing priorities and strategies for the 11FYP which was in
    early stages of preparation at the time of the ICR.

   Objectives: The aims embodied in the EDP remain highly relevant and consistent to
    successor operations the RGOB is undertaking using its own funds.

   Design: EDP’s design was highly relevant and crucial to the needs of Bhutan,
    particularly to expand access, especially for disadvantaged children; improve the
    quality of teaching and learning; and strengthen the institutional foundation of the
    delivery system for primary education. EDP clearly performed well. Not only did
    more students come into the system, but they have also been provided with better
    quality education. EDP support to strengthen core government administration is seen
    in the depth of RGOB’s decentralized management, the increased efficiency and cost-
    effectiveness, and the greater autonomy of key agencies in service delivery. However,
    on capacity building, the project design could have paid greater attention to
    articulating more specific implementation strategies. Having more explicit targets for
    process-oriented KPIs would also have been beneficial to guide implementation.

   Implementation: After initial delays, the pace of implementation improved and the
    MOE and Bank made significant efforts in tackling challenges which arose, in part,
    due to unforeseen factors affecting the school building program, as noted earlier. The
    delays resulted in a need for a project extension and cost escalation. The potential for
    conducting impact evaluations could have been more fully exploited to build up a


                                            11
      strong empirical base of evidence for EDP’s contribution to improved teaching and
      learning. Overall, however, the project was implemented effectively and brought to a
      successful close.

3.2 Achievement of Project Development Objectives

35.     The significant upward trend in nearly all of EDP’s key performance indicators is
testimony to the role of the MOE in leading implementation of EDP. The increase in
student places at the MSS and HSS levels can be directly attributed to EDP. While it is
not appropriate to attribute quality and institutional gains solely to EDP, it can be said
that the project played an important catalytic role toward ensuring these improvements.
Specifically for the IDA investment, the success of Component 1 was largely responsible
for the full disbursement under the project. All three aspects of the PDO were
successfully reached. The PDO and intermediate outcome indicators for the achievement
of each of the three aspects in the PDO, along with relevant 9FYP objectives, are
presented in the tables below, and rated. The outputs of activities undertaken in support
of the PDO are described in Annex 2.

PDO 1: Assist in implementation of education development program of the 9FYP

36.      The overall rating for PDO1 is Satisfactory.

37.    The management of basic education was strengthened at the center, dzongkhag
and school levels through comprehensive human resource development and staffing, as
well as improved decentralized supervisory and monitoring systems at the center,
dzongkhag and school levels. Within MOE, the Administration and Finance Division


                                                     12
(responsible for procurement and financial management), the Human Resource
Management Division (responsible for recruitment, deployment and management of all
personnel of the MOE), the Policy and Planning Division (responsible for education
planning, policy formulation and monitoring of all education programs in the country as
well as donor coordination), and the SPBD benefited significantly from EDP. This came
through targeted training as well as the experience of managing the project. The overall
result was a stronger foundation for coordination and management across the sector than
was present at EDP’s inception. At the dzongkhag level, the Dzongkhag Education
Officers and teachers were trained in education planning, policy and management and
curriculum leadership. The large dzongkhags now have up to three Assistant Dzongkhag
Education Officers managing and providing professional support services to schools.
Bhutan is well on track to achieve UPE and the Millennium Development Goals in
education.

38.     The ICR’s desk review of the last six (2005-2010) Annual Education Conferences
shows overall improvement of the education system as viewed by the Dzingkhag
Education Officers, school principals and MOE officials. Quality improvements are seen
in the areas of curriculum, deployment and promotion of teachers, on-time delivery of
textbooks (revealing the success of decentralization of the procurement system), and
computer education /literacy. The need for capacity development of teachers and support
staff, and demand for more financial assistance to schools are among the concerns which
continue to call for attention. The Dzongkhag Education Officers have expressed interest
(November 2011) in the sector’s continued use of LGSF construction technology.

39.     The consolidation of institutional and professional capacity is also evident
throughout the federated system of the Royal University of Bhutan. In addition to the
large Secretariat building constructed with EDP funds, the RUB benefited from external
technical assistance which helped to develop the “Wheel of Academic Law,? the
academic regulations which now govern the university. Technical assistance to RUB’s
Strategic Plan 2004-2013 resulted in a core document that served as the basis for the
RUB’s development under the 10FYP. With all required infrastructure and facilities in
place for its network of colleges and institutes, RUB was delinked from the Royal Civil
Service Commission in July 2011 and is now an autonomous institution. It has a total
capacity of 5,000 students, with plans to expand to 9,000 students by 2013.

41.     The strong upward trend in sector indicators is documented in the ICR DataSheet.
This section concentrates on the IDA investment – school construction – which
contributed to the 9FYP objectives to increase basic education up to Grade 10, well up
into secondary education. Under EDP, school construction was allocated nearly three-
quarters of the project estimated financing at appraisal; the amount was increased by 25
percent during implementation. The result was that EDP exceeded the targets for spaces
to be created to accommodate the increased number of students graduating from the
primary, lower secondary and middle secondary schools. The final number (28) of
schools, while less than expected (29), did not reduce the original target for additional
student places. Instead, the project created 16,320 student places. This was achieved by
establishing bigger schools at the middle and higher secondary levels to make more
efficient use of available resources. The project built nine new middle and higher
secondary schools compared to the PIP provision of only two new schools at this level.
Of the nine new schools, six are located in the remote areas of Sarpang, Trashigang,
Lhuntse and Zhemgang.

42.     The project also built an estimated 33 percent more science and computer
laboratory spaces, as well as ten percent more boarding places compared to what was
envisaged in the PIP, due to the expanded investment in new construction at middle and
higher secondary levels. One new feature of EDP schools was the creation of teacher
spaces with individual workstations in a teacher room in the administrative building,
providing a place for teachers to plan their lessons. The use of the LGSF technology in
particular clearly cut down the use of local construction materials, which are scarce and


                                                    14
expensive, as experienced in the earlier IDA projects. Use of LGSF was also opportune
as it came at a time when there was intense competition for available resources and labor
due to the rapid growth in the private sector housing and hydro power projects. The
adoption of LGSF reduced the typical school construction time by 50 percent, based on
comparisons with earlier IDA-financed projects: with LGSF, the labor time was
approximately 11 person days per square meter compared with 23 under the prior project.

43.     From the safety perspective, the earthquakes in September 2009 and September
2011 which shook Bhutan and damaged many houses did not have any reported visible
effect on the school facilities built using LGSF technology. This was confirmed by an
RGOB inspection team that visited all EDP schools, and the ICR team visits to 13 of the
28 schools. The MOE is considering the revival and further use of LGSF technology
during the 11FYP period, which demonstrates confidence in the new technology for
schools.

44.     EDP was key to the introduction of the new LGSF construction method – the first
of its kind in Bhutan – not only for the benefit of school construction to meet urgent
access needs, but also to provide skills development and new employment opportunities
for youth who are normally not attracted to labor-intensive low wage employment offered
by the building industry.2 The pioneering of LGSF technology also helped build capacity
of the local suppliers and Bhutanese entrepreneurs.

45.     Finally, SPBD not only introduced a new construction technology for school
construction in Bhutan, but built up the genesis of an industry from scratch, including the
training of construction workers and capacity building within the construction industry.
SPBD was a highly successful implementation arm of the MOE, built up over three IDA-
financed projects, with a winning combination of professional and technical experience
with youthful enthusiasm. Support from MOE was apparently constant and this allowed
the particularly complex challenge of building a large number of schools in a short period
of time under EDP to be addressed.




2
  With the introduction of the LGSF technology, there is also a positive interest in youth (boys and girls) to
take up this kind of work. A total of 290 LGSF workers were trained in the use of LGSF technology,
surpassing the original target of 200, which was possible due to the innovative approach taken by MOE for
implementing the training program, which included financial incentives. The ICR notes the commendable
commitment and dedication of the LGSF workers, as evidenced by their positive outlook and persistent
performance even when they were posted to remote construction sites; the ICR interviews with several
contractors confirmed this. Some of the workers the EDP trained are now working at the level of site
supervisors/ managers. Compared to the conventional building worker, the higher level of education of
LGSF workers has made them more adaptable to the private market and to prospective building industry
employers.

       improving the quality and relevance of education. There was no effect on these
       interventions when financing for the component was halved as a result of the decision
       that EDP would not finance construction of the MOE complex.

       47.      Progress and results were satisfactory in the areas of:

            Curriculum reform in Mathematics for PP to Grade 12: Major initiatives were carried
             out to make the curriculum more relevant to the Bhutanese context, age-appropriate
             and to include international best practices. In addition, the EDP financed procurement
             of mathematics textbooks, which were not in the PAD at appraisal. The reformed
             curriculum is now in practice for PP through Grade 12. Results are being seen in
             improved examination scores: for example, there has been an impressive increase in
             the average Grade 10 scores in math, from 39 percent in 2002 to 52 in 2010.

            Supply of supplementary reading materials to schools: Supplies of supplementary
             materials in English, Dzongkha, and mathematics, as well as library books, were
             distributed to 546 (against a planned 296) primary and secondary schools. The
             majority of schools have functional libraries for the first time in their existence.



                                                          16
     Expansion of the IT education program to all secondary schools in the country: The
      EDP activities laid the foundation for extending IT to the entire country; computer
      literacy has reached even to community schools in remote regions. The impact of the
      EDP initiatives has reached beyond the scope of the project, as it has been
      complemented by follow-on programs, in part financed through domestic resources.

     Development of higher education under the umbrella of the Royal University of
      Bhutan: The development of the RUB has been described in a previous section. It can
      be added that the rapid evolution of the RUB was complemented by the establishment
      of Bhutan’s first private college, the Royal Thimphu College (RTC), which is
      affiliated to the RUB and began offering degree level programs in 2009. Another
      significant development was Bhutan’s Tertiary Education Policy approved by Cabinet
      in February 2010. This was the first time the country articulated objectives and
      policies for tertiary education as a sector.

48.      The ICR found more moderate progress and/or impact in the areas of:

     Resource Centers (RC): Despite the dedicated advocacy of the MOE’s Curriculum
      and Professional Support Division (CPSD) for the RC approach to support clusters of
      schools, the RCs were generally assessed to have limited impact. Some RCs attracted
      teachers’ interest to share and learn new teaching approaches, and to access resources
      such as photocopiers and computers, but RCs suffered from a lack of technical back-
      up and limited support for maintenance (beyond the initial financing from EDP).
      Underperformance of the RCs was a frequent theme in the Bank’s supervision visits
      during which the Bank and MOE teams explored potential measures for
      improvements, including recruitment of volunteer expatriate teachers from abroad.

     National program of in-service for teachers: EDP supported numerous in-service
      training functions. However, work was delayed on a strategy to address in-service
      needs within a comprehensive national plan that would also take account of an overall
      shift in policy away from national in-service workshops for teachers held during the
      long winter school holidays. The delay was partly due to overloaded staff in the MOE
      units who were to have taken the strategy development forward. During EDP’s final
      year, and using other resources, the MOE contracted a renowned international
      consultancy firm to develop the strategy.

     Innovation Grant scheme: Coordinated by one of the MOE divisions, this program
      got underway early on (2004). Dzongkhag committees reviewed and screened
      proposals. Grants were awarded to 36 schools. While results have not been formally
      assessed, the ICR interviews with a sample of school heads revealed, retrospectively,
      positive anecdotal evidence that the grants gave impetus to local initiatives to
      improve the quality of teaching and learning. Funds had been used to purchase
      laptops, solar panels and generators, and other teaching aids. This scheme lacked
      some degree of ownership from the start, as its introduction was of keener interest to
      the Bank preparation team than to MOE.


                                             17
   Tracer study to track the quality of school leavers and tertiary graduates: MOE was
    hesitant that the tracer study could add value to other information already available on
    youth and the labor market, so this study also lacked ownership from the start. Its
    introduction was of greater interest to the Bank preparation team than to MOE. While
    Bhutan carried out a national census in 2005, MOE judged this would be disruptive
    for field work on a tracer study. The terms of reference for the tracer study were
    prepared in 2006, refined, and finalized in 2010. The PPD completed the study and a
    first draft report on results just as EDP was closing. The report highlights
    recommendations for responsive policies and programs in the context of high youth
    unemployment and under-employment in Bhutan. As a consequence of the delay in
    conducting the tracer study, the MOE did not establish a baseline or track progress on
    two of the KPIs originally in the Results Framework of the PAD, indicators related to
    the employment success of school leavers and graduates.

3.3 Efficiency

49.     The economic analysis (Annex 3) presents retrospective cost-benefit and fiscal
sustainability assessments of the EDP against the assumptions underlying the analysis at
the time of project preparation. Based on estimates at appraisal, the project yielded an
Economic Internal Rate of Return (EIRR) of 14 percent and a Net Present Value of
US$2.24 million.

50.     From the data available to the ICR, completion rates, especially at the secondary
level, have increased by about 20 percent. Employment rates for graduates at both the
secondary and tertiary levels improved by more than ten percent – unemployment falling
from about 12 percent to eight percent for secondary graduates, and to five percent for
tertiary graduates. In terms of wages, the data show that wages in 2010 for graduates are
roughly similar to those predicted in the PAD. Using these data, the EIRR is 16 percent
and the Net Present Value is $3.03 million, which are higher than the projections at
appraisal. In sum: Benefits and costs (Rating: Satisfactory). Internal Efficiency (Rating:
Satisfactory).

3.4 Justification of Overall Outcome Rating

51.     Table 4 provides a summary of scores of different aspects of project outcomes,
using a six-point scale and weights assigned to reflect the relative importance of different
factors. The end result is an Outcome rating of Satisfactory. The elements in the
respective categories “Relevance? and “Efficiency? are weighted evenly. This is based on
the ICR’s findings, described above, that each element is equally strong. The weight
given to PDO2 in the “Efficacy? category is consistent with the proportionately larger
amount of the IDA investment that went to infrastructure.

3.5 Overarching Themes, Other Outcomes and Impacts

(a) Poverty Impacts, Gender Aspects, and Social Development

52.     The most significant contribution of EDP was the increased access to middle and
higher secondary education, particularly for girls, thereby helping to achieve gender
parity at these levels. Gender parity has already been attained at lower levels. An
achievement unequivocally attributed to the EDP was the creation of an alternative
avenue for school leavers to take up vocational jobs by making work in the construction
industry more attractive; and the participation of girls in the construction sector, which
had hitherto been a predominantly male dominated industry. Of the 290 construction
workers trained under the project, 50 percent reportedly were girls. In addition, school
construction supported by EDP provided access to schools in remote locations where
service was formerly limited. While an empirical analysis has not been conducted,
evidence supports the fact that the construction of schools in remote areas has led to an
increase in the number of first generation learners form poor households being able to
attend school.

(b) Institutional Change/Strengthening

53.     Strengthening of country capacity effectively to address the policy priorities of
the national education framework was a critical part of the EDP and occurred at multiple
levels beginning with the national policy making level (e.g. curriculum reform) down to
the level of service delivery in schools. A key intervention for institutional strengthening
was the Human Resource Development Program which provided scholarships and
fellowships for off-site study as well as in-situ training tailored to the needs of the


                                                  19
beneficiaries. The establishment of the RUB Secretariat was supported by the project, and
RGOB provided the necessary resources that enabled it to function effectively to the
point of take-off as an autonomous institution. The professional evolution of the Bhutan
Board of Examinations (BBE) was supported, and it has demonstrated a high level of
competence in the leading role it plays in Bhutan, and the recognition gained in the
region and internationally. Both EDP and the previous IDA-financed education project
supported development of BBE. From July 2011, the BBE was accorded status as an
autonomous Bhutan Council for School Examinations and Assessment – with a core
mandate for Secondary School Examinations and Certification, Assessment and
Monitoring, training services, research and publication in the areas of examination,
assessment, and quality of learning.

(c) Other Unintended Outcomes and Impacts (positive or negative)
54.    None.

3.6 Summary of Findings of Beneficiary Survey and/or Stakeholder Workshops
N/A

4. Assessment of Risk to Development Outcome
Rating: Moderate.     .

55.     The overall risk to development outcome is rated moderate. The objectives in the
EDP PDO remain high among RGOB’s priorities as it prepares its 11FYP. The project in
conjunction with MOE’s additional inputs to scale up several of its interventions
(including reform of curricular and examination content to make them more relevant to
the Bhutanese context, in-service teacher training programs, school and institutional
performance self-assessments, and IT assisted instruction) and the successful
implementation of the LGSF technology have laid a stronger foundation for the continual
strengthening of activities under the remaining period of the 10FYP and later under the
11FYP. Continued investment by the RGOB will be crucial to ensuring that the
established system continues to function well and that additional reforms such as the new
tertiary education policy will be implemented effectively. Several development partners
have indicated their intention to scale down or end support to Bhutan at the end of the
10FYP since Bhutan’s GNI is now above US$2,000 and it approaches middle income
status. There is strong momentum at the policy level to sustain reform and development
in the education sector. The RGOB will need to manage the risk that human resource
capacity could continue to be a constraint in implementation.

5. Assessment of Bank and Borrower Performance

5.1 Bank Performance
(a) Bank Performance in Ensuring Quality at Entry
Rating: Moderately Satisfactory




                                           20
56.    The PAD was meticulously prepared in line with the sector issues identified in the
9FYP. Project preparation took 14 months from identification to Approval and required a
reasonable 60 staff weeks. The number and scope of the KPIs were consistent with what
was needed to monitor progress of EDP and sector development more broadly. However,
the range of indicators and assumptions that many of the baselines would be established
by activities undertaken in the first phase of implementation were ambitious in light of
the education sector’s evolving capacity. The preparation team under-estimated the costs
for school construction using the LGSF technology, which led to delays in
implementation and the need for additional financing; but it is understandable that the
appraisal may have had difficulties since the LGSF technology had not been used before
in Bhutan, and its supply chain was largely untested and subject to geo-political factors
beyond Bhutan’s control. It is unclear how the preparation team computed the expected
US$8 million counterpart contribution from the RGOB, particularly since the DCA
shows 97-100 percent financing by IDA for all categories. During implementation, the
RGOB followed the DCA. It was assumed that RGOB was expected to base its
expenditures on recurrent costs, but these were not quantified. As a result, the tables in
Annex 1 of the ICR, based on actual RGOB expenditure on the EDP up to project closure
may suggest that RGOB did not follow through on counterpart funding.

(b) Quality of Supervision

57. Rating: Satisfactory. Bank supervision was regularly conducted every six months,
filing a total of 16 ISRs; half were carried out before the MTR. The Aides-memoire
candidly assess progress and constraints, and the ISRs show a highly interactive dialogue
between the TTL and Bank management in the seeking and provision of guidance on
positions to communicate with the RGOB. The Bank Task Team Leader (TTL) had been
a member of the preparation team and managed the project until it closed. Additionally,
in the last year of the project, the TTL was based in Thimphu as the World Bank’s
Representative to Bhutan and maintained ongoing dialogue with MOE regarding EDP.
This continuity as well as the TTL’s in-depth knowledge of Bhutan were assets in
maintaining a supportive presence with government counterparts. Bank managers were
consistent in advising that adequate attention be given to the EDP interventions to
improve quality and relevance of learning, so these would not be overshadowed by the
effort on school construction, and the Bank team worked to ensure that systems were put
in place to enhance the focus on quality. Managers encouraged the Bank and MOE teams
to carry out the impact assessments in order to understand better what worked in the
change process of bringing about higher quality outcomes in teaching and learning. The
Bank team, including its financial management and procurement units based in Delhi and
Chennai, India, not only conducted portfolio and fiduciary reviews, but also provided
advisory support appreciated by the MOE team, particularly to help fill skills gaps when
MOE staff redeployments at several points brought in new project officers unfamiliar
with IDA procedures. Regular and joint inspection by the Bank, MOE and SPBD staff
invested heavily in maintaining the quality of construction and materials. The Bank’s
expert in school construction (architect consultant based in India) was included in all
supervision visits except the last one, for which the ICR arranged for an external


                                           21
consultant to make site visits and assess the overall results of the school building program.
The Bank’s Indian consultant also visited the EDP school sites in between the full team
supervision missions, particularly accessing the east of Bhutan from Guwahati, Assam, to
monitor construction at schools which were otherwise several days’ drive from Thimphu.

(c) Justification of Rating for Overall Bank Performance
Rating: Moderately Satisfactory.

58.     Based on the two assessments above, which derive from desk reviews of the ISRs,
Aides-memoire, and interviews conducted by the ICR team, overall Bank performance
was moderately satisfactory. The task team and senior management were consistently
motivated by their commitment to promote the best interests of the Client and the project.
The Bank was responsive in approving additional IDA financing to meet increased costs
of the school building program, justified on the evidence that the reasons for cost
escalation were largely outside the control of the RGOB. Testimony to the strongly
collaborative relationship between the Bank and the RGOB is the latter’s agreement to
take on, from its own, additional domestic resources, any residual financing to cover final
payments to close the construction contracts.

5.2 Borrower Performance
(a) Government Performance
Rating: Satisfactory

59.     RGOB participated actively in project identification, and the 9FYP provided a
solid framework for project preparation. At the technical level, a key MOE/RGOB input
to the preparatory process was the pilot of the LGSF technology at one school that was
completed in the first year of EDP. From beginning to end during implementation, MOE
senior management showed a high level of dedication and commitment to achieving good
outcomes under EDP as well as productive synergies with parallel actions supported by
RGOB’s own resources. In the first year of EDP implementation, when the number of
candidates for the LGSF training program was too low to meet requirements of the
construction program, the MOE intervened with incentives in the form of training
stipends paid per trainee to contractors who trained additional Bhutanese workers in
LGSF technology. This proved so successful that the number of candidates rose beyond
the original target. From midpoint in 2010, MOE proactively took on the direct
management of contracts for the remaining civil works in order to deliver the agreed
number of schools by project closure.

(b) Implementing Agency or Agencies Performance
Rating: Satisfactory

60.    The quality of the substantive dialogue on the range of issues discussed under
EDP was rich and productive; a good sense of candid collaboration prevailed at all times
between the MOE and the Bank task team. MOE had a strong vision for education sector
development and the cumulative benefits of the three consecutive IDA-financed


                                            22
operations since 1988. MOE employed its sense of the sector’s readiness to take on EDP
activities and deferred some interventions in Components 2 and 3 until later in the project.

61.     At a technical level, what stands out is the impressive performance of the SPBD
in pioneering the introduction of LGSF technology for the entire country, and admirably
managing an ambitious school building program. Other aspects of project management
can be considered moderately satisfactory. Embedding the project in the MOE was at the
same time a strength and a challenge because successful implementation required the
attention of staff which regularly faced competing demands for their time. In particular,
this appeared to crowd out the conduct of impact evaluations of EDP activities.
Furthermore, for a large part of project interventions in Component 2 it had been
assumed that the requisite knowledge and capacity for implementation would either be
available or would emerge during implementation. This did occur for some interventions,
including the curricular reform managed by the Curriculum and Professional Support
Division (CAPSD). CAPSD had built real in-house expertise as a result of previous
human resource development under earlier IDA-financed projects. In other areas, staff
showed reluctance to act because they were less sure how to tackle the specific issues.

62.     A staff member at the Policy and Planning Division was responsible for overall
coordination of EDP. The person in this position changed three times over the project’s
lifetime. This along with periodic changes in MOE staff who were managing specific
EDP components, and changes in financial accounting and procurement staff, contributed
to uneven technical oversight during implementation and results are evident in the
moderately satisfactory ratings given to financial management, procurement, M&E and
PDO3. New incoming staff would have benefited from hand-over actions carried out with
the predecessors. Although there were delays in procurement and an initial disbursement
lag under EDP, implementation issues were resolved and construction and procurement
targets were me. Civil works were supervised and built to a high standard.

(c) Justification of Rating for Overall Borrower Performance
Rating: Satisfactory

63.     This rating is based on the overall satisfactory compliance with due diligence in
fiduciary aspects – there were no unresolved procurement or financial management issues
at the end of the project – the strong performance of the SPBD, and the decisive
participation of MOE’s senior management which kept momentum for EDP to deliver
satisfactory results. The strengths highlighted above offset the weaknesses.

6. Lessons Learned

64.      General:

     Government leadership is crucial to the achievement of success in large scale national
      programs and to ensuring that all available resources both internal and external are
      maximized during implementation and to sustain the project assets after it ends.


                                             23
     The phasing of large, sector-wide investments in a planned sequence and with a
      program framework that coordinates assistance from different sources better enables
      gains to accumulate over time and to be refined for maximum impact. Well structured
      and unified coordination and management mechanisms, and a functional M&E
      system, are crucial for successful implementation and for assessing the impact of
      investments. Student learning achievement is especially challenging, as it is slow to
      change, and improvements system-wide are less likely to take root from time-bound,
      “projectized? inputs.

65.      Project-specific:

     The broad scope of the EDP put some of the smaller components at risk. The project
      design covered many aspects of the sector, and included a large number of small sub-
      components with limited funding. In the context of a ministry with limited capacity,
      and a project heavily focused on construction and large procurement items, there was
      limited support, at times, for some of the minor components.
     With the end of World Bank Group financing of the Bhutan education sector, it will
      be important for MOE to maintain a significant degree of construction related
      professionalism built up over the years, to act as a technical resource for further
      education expansion over the 10FYP and 11FYP, for LGSF use in schools, and for a
      comprehensive national maintenance approach to preserve the amazing stock of
      schools built up over a relatively short period of 20 years.
     While the EDP has improved the quality and relevance of education, it did not focus
      (by design) on vocational and soft skills, which is something that employers are
      demanding more of. This could represent a significant concern and, moving forward,
      the RGOB would be well advised to continue the efforts now underway to pay
      significant attention to this area.
     EDP seamlessly included support to areas targeted under earlier IDA-financed
      education projects in Bhutan, particularly for the longer-term commitment required
      for meaningful and sustained improvement of teaching-learning. This helped foster
      ownership and continuity in education system development in Bhutan, even during
      Bhutan’s 2008 transition to democratic governance wherein political manipulation of
      development planning could have started to pose a concern.

 Annex 3. Economic and Financial Analysis

 I. Introduction

 1.      EDP supported Bhutan’s objectives for the development of the education system,
 including a significant increase in access to the primary and secondary cycles, and
 improved quality and demand responsiveness of secondary and tertiary education. The
 project supported the Government’s strategy of creating a well-educated populace.

 2.      The continuing high demand for education among students and parents led the
 government to embark on a significant expansion plan to increase access to high quality
 secondary and higher education relevant to the needs of the labor market. Ensuring
 quality and relevance at a time of high demand for education, a major physical expansion
 of Bhutan's education system, and an expanding private sector, were major challenges
 that were addressed through the EDP, as shown below. Enhanced focus on access and
 quality led to improvements in both the number of children going to school as well as on
 improved learning taking place at schools (as measured by improvements in the internal
 efficiency of the system). Finally, external efficiency also improved owing to the system
 producing students more relevant to market needs. Notwithstanding these improvements,
 continued investment in the education system in the coming years is necessary to ensure
 that the gains in terms of access, quality and efficiency are sustained and improved upon.

 3.     This annex provides a short description of the demand and supply for skills and
 also examines the returns to education as well as the fiscal sustainability of the system.

 II. The Market for Skills

 (a) The Supply of Skills at the Secondary and Higher Levels

 4.     There have been several positive and significant developments in the education
 system in Bhutan over the past few years.

 5.      Partly owing to support provided by the EDP program, Bhutan has been very
 successful in raising enrolments in the secondary and tertiary education system (Table 1)
 with enrolments close to doubling in high school and increasing by over 400 percent in
 higher level institutions.

                Table 1: Growth in Secondary School Enrollments (1996-2000)

                                                  34
6.      EDP also enhanced focus on girls education and a very positive development over
the past few years has been the achievement of gender parity – while in 2002 girls
constituted only about 45 percent of total enrolment at the secondary level, by 2010 this
number had risen to just over 50 percent – marking the important achievement of the
gender parity MDG at the secondary level in Bhutan. Gender parity also exists at the
primary level.

7.     Another significant achievement has been the growth of private provision of
education – with about 50% of students at the higher secondary level enrolled in private
schools as compared to only 30% at the time when EDP was initiated.

8.     While access to the system has improved over the past few years, some of the
most impressive gains have been on improving the internal efficiency of the system
which can be seen as a proxy for improved system quality (Table 2).

9.     On all indicators – repetition rates, dropout rates, transition rates – the system
shows encouraging improvements as compared to the pre-EDP statistics. So not only did
more students come into the system over the past few years, but they have also been
provided with better quality education.

(b) The Demand for Skills and Demand-Supply Mismatches

Bhutan’s Labor Market

10.     There has been a significant increase in the labor force, labor force participation
rates and the number of people employed since 2002. From about 60 percent in 2002, the
labor force participation rate has increased to over 67 percent by 2010, with the labor
force increasing from about 227,000 to 334,000 – a significant annual increase of about 5
percent. Inspite of this fairly substantial increase – employment growth has impressively
kept up – with overall unemployment rising just marginally from 1.9 to over 3 percent
over this time period. Employment growth in the private sector has been high –
especially in the construction, manufacturing and hospitality sectors. The 2010
Investment Climate Survey, for example shows that the median Bhutanese firm reported
an increase in sales by 36 percent and in employment by 25 percent between 2006 and
2008.

11.    However, as shown in Figure 1, unemployment rates among the 15-24 age group
remain high at close to 10 percent. By education level – the unemployment rate for
secondary graduates is 8 percent while it is 5 percent for university graduates. While
these numbers have declined from unemployment rates of about 12 percent for these
graduates in 2002, they do point to the fact that the education system needs to be better
geared to the needs of the local labor market.




                                            36
Demand-Supply Mismatch

12.     Skills shortages remain a significant issue – especially with the rapid growth of
the private sector. 13 percent of Bhutanese firms lack of appropriate skills is a major
constraint to further growth.




13.    As seen above, this proportion increases by firm size. One hypothesis is that
while EDP has improved the quality and relevance of education, it did not focus on
vocational and soft skills – which is something that employers are demanding more of.
This could represent a significant concern and, moving forward, the Government would
be well advised also to pay significant attention to this area.

III. Cost Benefit Analysis

14.     The project was expected to lead to both higher internal efficiency of the system
as well as higher external efficiency – through making students more marketable. It
should be kept in mind that while the labor market information systems have improved,
there are still gaps in the labor market information system – particularly in the data on
wages – which make the analysis less than perfect.

15.    Benefit stream. The assumptions underlying the analysis at the time of project
preparation were:
      The benefits from the project are predominantly through improvements in
       secondary education outcomes. While students in primary education will also
       benefit from the project, these benefits are assumed to be small and are hence
       ignored. On the tertiary side, it is assumed that 10 percent of the benefits accrued
       are as a result of the project;
      Benefits are assumed to arise from improved internal efficiency of the system –
       which is proxied for by improved completion rates – and increases in external


                                            37
       efficiency of the system – proxied for by higher employment probabilities as well
       as higher starting wages of graduates;
      Completion rates are assumed to increase by 10 percent for both secondary and
       tertiary education over the life of the project;
      In terms of gains in employment – it is assumed that the project will lead to higher
       employment in the formal non-agricultural sector;
      Formal employment is also assumed to increase by 10 percent for both secondary
       and tertiary education over the life of the project. While it may be more
       appropriate to use a measure of employment elasticity to compute the potential
       increase in employment, reliable numbers do not exist;
      In terms of wages, it is assumed that as a result of improvements in quality and
       relevance by the end of the project – average starting wages of secondary
       graduates will match the average starting wages of current tertiary graduates (an
       increase of around 20 percent). Starting wages of tertiary graduates are also
       expected to increase by the same proportion over the life of the project.

16.     The benefit stream is computed as the increase in the present value of lifetime
earnings as a result of the assumptions made above. The estimated direct costs of the
project comprise the project investment.

17.    Based on these assumptions, the project yielded an Economic Internal Rate of
Return (EIRR) of 14 percent and a Net Present Value of $2.24 million.

18.      Based on the data available – completion rates, especially at the secondary level
have increased by about 20 percent. Employment rates for graduates at both the
secondary and tertiary levels have improved by more than 10 percent – unemployment
falling from about 12 percent to eight percent for secondary graduates and to five percent
for tertiary graduates. In terms of wages, the data show that wages in 2010 for graduates
are roughly similar to those predicted in the PAD. Using these data, the EIRR is 16
percent and the Net Present Value is $3.03 million, which are higher than the projections
at appraisal.

19.    It should be borne in mind that the real rate of return is likely to be somewhat
higher reflecting positive externalities and longer-term intergenerational social benefits
which come with increased levels of education, including lower fertility rates and
improved health outcomes to which it is difficult to assign monetary values.

V. Fiscal Sustainability Analysis

20.     With the economy growing more rapidly (on average) than predicted by the data
at time of appraisal, and education expenditures as a share of government expenditures
rising to over 16 percent by 2010, analysis shows that the government has easily been
able to absorb the recurrent costs implications of EDP.




                                           38
21.    Government expenditures in 2010/11 were about $454 million, and total
education expenditures were about 72 million. Recurrent expenditures are estimated at
around 65 percent of total education expenditures – hence they were $47 million in
2010/11. For purposes of this assessment, it has been assumed that recurrent costs are
comprised of salaries (including wages and benefits), materials, and repairs and
maintenance. According to estimates undertaken by MOHE, taking into consideration
the recurrent cost implications of the new schools to be constructed during the EDP
period, the recurrent costs for the system was expected to be about $29 million in
2010/11. This is well within the actual recurrent costs for 2010/11 which are $47 million
– implying that the system is financially sustainable in the post EDP era.

Summary of Borrower’s ICR

1.      The following provides a brief synopsis of the borrower’s ICR that assessed
results of the project.

I.        The Project: Objectives and Preparation

2.      The project supported the expansion of educational opportunities and
improvement in education quality at all levels. The project composed of three main
components: (a) Expanding access to primary and secondary education; (b) improving
quality and relevance of education at all levels; and (c) Institutional strengthening.

3.     From its inception, the project was strongly focused on and adhered to the agreed
development objectives which did not change through implementation. The PAD was
prepared in consultation with the stakeholders’ assessment and needs-based assessment
and was aligned with the goals and objectives of the Ninth Five Year Plan.

4.      EDP inherited a number of objectives from earlier IDA projects and incorporated
lessons learned from the Primary Education Project and Second Education Project in its
design. Importance was given to: (a) expansion and upgrading of existing schools rather
than new construction; (b) preparing the master plan to maximize the use of available
land; (c) adoption of the Light Gauge Steel Framework (LGSF) methodology for
construction; (d) regional distribution of schools; (e) improvement of school curriculum
in core subjects such as Maths, Science and English; (f) capacity development at the
central, dzongkag and school levels, and; (d) building strong monitoring and evaluation
measures.

II.       Achievement of Objectives and Outputs

5.      There was significant improvement in enhancing access to quality education,
improving the quality and relevance of the curriculum, increased IT connectivity and
computer education, improved examination results and monitoring and evaluation. Some
of the key results include:

         Increase in the NER and GER for grades pp-6 from 62 percent and 81 percent
          respectively to 95.1 percent and 120 percent respectively between 2002 and 2011;
         Completion rate at Grade 6 increased from 71 percent to 100 percent between
          2002 and 2011;
         GER in grades 7-10 increased from 49 percent to 88 percent and GER in grades
          11-12 increased from 18 percent to 49 percent;




                                             44
      Progress on gender parity with ratio of girls to boys increasing from 47 percent to
       50.1 percent for pp-6 grades and from 45 percent to 57.6 percent or 7-10 grades
       between 2002-2011;
      Improvement in average pass rates for Grade 10 and 12 students in public
       examinations and improvement in average scores in English, mathematics and
       Science;

6.      Additionally, there is an overall improvement in the education system with the
Annual Education Conference (AEC) instituted in 2007, providing a platform for DEOs,
principals and officials from different levels discussing issues and challenges faced and
coming up with recommendations for improvement of the education system. Information
from the AECs suggests that the qualitative aspects of education have been getting
greater emphasis – computer education, curriculum, school monitoring, delivery of text
books, teacher requisition and deployment and teacher promotion. The need for capacity
development of teachers, support staff to ease workload of teachers, long-term teacher
training are issues that are garnering greater attention. Obviously, more needs to be done
in all these areas. The issue of supply of textbooks and teaching learning material has
also been addressed owing to the decentralization of procurement to the Dzongkhags.
Component 1: Expanding Access
7.     The improvement in indicators is influenced by6 increased access at all levels.
The construction/expansion of new schools and expansion and upgradation of existing
schools in addition to other initiatives undertaken by the government benefited the
students coming from both urban and remote areas. A total of nine new schools were
constructed and 21 were expanded/upgraded. A total of 408 classrooms were created
against the planned 316. The project also increased boarding spaces from the planned
100 to 120.

8.      The use of LGSF technology cut down the use of local construction material
which are scarce and expensive and helped cut short construction time in some cases by
as much as 50 percent. The introduction of LGSF technology also had significant
positive externalities as it led to skills development and new employment opportunities
for youth.

9.     The quality of the new technology was further proved when the earthquakes of
2009 and 2011 which damaged many houses and buildings did not have any adverse
impact on the schools built under the project. The DEO’s have expressed the need to
adhere to the LGSF construction technology with improved school designs. The features
of the LGSF technology – short construction times and earthquake resistance are well
regarded by end users.




                                           45
Component 2: Improved Access, Quality and Relevance of Secondary and Tertiary
Education

10.    The development and revision of curriculum, textbooks, teaching learning
materials, introduction of computer education, provision of innovation grants and
resource centers are initiatives undertaken under this component. Furthermore, this
component has also established the Secretariat of the Royal University of Bhutan.

11.     Core subjects such as Mathematics, English and Science were also reformed to
ensure that the curriculum is relevant to the Bhutanese context. In addition,
supplementary reading materials have been supplied to more than 400 schools (against a
target of 296). The procurement of library books, textbooks and stationary for schools has
now been decentralized to the school level. 15 resource centers (RCs) were established
under EDP to serve as a hub for professional development for their cluster schools
teachers. All RCs were operational by mid-term; however there are constraints in the
planning and implementation of RC programs, especially owing to capacity constraints.
Efforts are underway by RGOB to mitigate these constraints and enhancing capacity of
the RCs.

12.     Innovation grants have been provided to 36 schools to allow them to use
local/community initiatives to address school-specific problems. Beneficiary schools
received LCD projectors, laptops, reading materials. However this program has not been
rigorously evaluated as yet.

13.    The introduction of IT curriculum in middle and higher secondary schools has
been extremely successful. Computer literacy has reached community schools in remote
corners of the country.

14.     The project has also constructed the office of the Royal University of Bhutan and
built the capacity of the staff in proper functioning of the governance and administration
of the university.

Component 3: Institutional Strengthening

15.     The capacity of the Policy and Planning Division, responsible for education
planning, policy formulation and monitoring of education projects, and that of the School
Planning and Building Division (SPBD) – an agency responsible for major school
construction – have been strengthened under the project. The efficiency of the SPBD has
improved considerably and the division continues to implement civil works, and provides
technical assistance to the Dzongkhags in building school infrastructure. Procurement
and financial management capacities – residing in the Administration and Finance
Division have also been enhanced. At the Dzongkhag level, the DEOs and teachers were
trained in education planning, policy and management and curriculum leadership areas.
Capacities were built up through long and short-term study tours and technical assistance.



                                           46
16.     The project also strengthened the education monitoring division and supported the
Ministry to implement a decentralized system of monitoring. DEO’s and ADEO’s were
trained and required to visit schools twice a year and report to EMSSD which in turn
reported to the Ministry. School self-assessment tools and school improvement plans
were also developed. Furthermore since 2010, a performance monitoring system was
developed to assess schools.

17.     Two national assessments were also carried out (in2005 and 2008) by the Bhutan
Board of Examinations (BBE) with technical support from the Australian Council of
Education Research (ACER). The project built high-level capacity in BBE to carry out
the assessments.

18.     Furthermore, school library development, supplementary reading programs and
the resource center were also evaluated during the course of the project. Finally, a tracer
study was carried out in 2010 to assess the employability of graduates of the education
system.

19.  One sub-component which was not undertaken was the establishment of a new
MoE Secretariat owing to budget shortfalls.


III.       Major Factors Affecting Implementation

20.      One remarkable achievement of the IDA assisted projects has been the
involvement of RGOB from project preparation through implementation with high levels
of ownership throughout. The RGOB accords highest priority in continued improvement
in access and quality and accordingly continually supports and supplements the project
activities even after the project has ended in order to maintain the momentum where the
cost benefit is positive in the foreseeable future such as e.g. exploring ICT education,
curriculum reform, decentralization of procurement of textbooks.

21.   Some factors outside the control of the implementation agency which affected
implementation included:

          Dependence on import for construction materials and the unanticipated increase in
           the price of steel which led to cost escalations beyond project allocations.
          Natural disasters – flooding and earthquakes delayed construction.
          Shortage of skilled labor – which hindered the smooth execution of construction
           work.
          Two special accounts – Maintaining two special accounts was a hurdle during
           initial phases of project implementation. These accounts were clubbed together at
           MTR.
