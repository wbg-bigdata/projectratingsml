I. LOAN AND PROJECT SUMMARY
Borrower:           Federative Republic of Brazil
Executing           The federal Technical Assistance and Rural Extension
Agencies:           Agency (EMBRATER) and the state/territorial associate
agencies (EMATERs/ASTERs)
Amount:             US$155.0 million equivalent
Terms:              Repayment in 15 years, including 3 years of grace, at the
Bank's standard variable interest rate
Project
Obiective:          The proposed project would aim to increase the scope,
efficiency and effectiveness of the National Agricultural
Extension System (SIBRATER).
Project
Description:        The proposed project is a follow-up to the Agricultural
Extension I Project (Loan 1568-BR), which was approved in
May 1978. It would consist of: (a) the further
institutional strengthening of EMBRATER and of the
EMATERs/ASTERs; (b) expansion and improvement of
extension services; (c) improvement in applied extension
mettiodology; (d) strengthening of farmer/extension/
research linkages; (e) provision of training and
technical assistance and studies; and (f) expansion of
social extension and community development programs. The
project is expected to improve the incomes and living
standards of Brazilian farmers and their families by
increasing their productivity and supporting the greater
participation of women in agricultural production and
related homecraft activities.
Beneficiaries:      Some 700,000 small-scale farmers are expected to benefit
directly from the project. In addition, some 150,000
rural families would benefit from social extersion and
community development services for the first tAme.
Project Risks:      Identifiable risks include: (a) problems of institutional
coordination in achieving expected administrative
efficiency; (b) the degree to which appropriate new
production packages are available; (c) the degree to
which these packages are accepted by farmers; and (d)
delays in counterpart funding which could occur
particularly at the state level. Much was achieved under
the first project to improve institutional coordination
between the Federal and state levels. In designing and



2-
preparing the proposed project, further instltutional
constraints were clearly defined and would be remedied
through appropriate procedural and staffing changes.
The proposed closer linkages among farmers, extensionisto
and research scientists have been specifically designed
to ensure that the problems of the farmers are being
addressed by research scientists, and that the new
production packages would be increasingly available for
adoption by farmers. With the Increased priority being
given to extension services by the Federal and state
governments, the risk related to the timely provision of
counterpart funds, would be minimized.

II. THE AGRICULTURAL SECTOR
Agriculture in the National Economy
2.01      Agriculture in Brazil has traditionally been the main source of exports
and employment, though a relatively small contributor to GDP. In 1970,
agriculture accounted for 12% of GDP, 44% of the economically active population
and 67% of total exports. In 1984, these figures were 13%, 30% and 38%,
respectively. Throughout the 1970s, there was a rapid expansion (5% per annum) in
Brazil's agriculture; during the recession in the early 1980s, output and
investment stagnated and then recovered in 1984 and 1985 (Annex 1, Tables 1, 2,
and 3).
2.02      The performance of the sector in the 1970s masked sharply disparate
rates of growth between regions, farm types and individual crops. The most
dynamic expansion was with products that rely on heavy capital investment or high
levels of seasonal inputs, such as soybeans; citrus, tobacco, cocoa, and sugarcane
on large commercial farms in central and southern Brazil. Much slower growth
rates, and in some cases declines, were recorded for such staple crops as rice,
maize, beans, manioc and potatoes (Annex 1, Table 4).
2.03      These trends in agricultural output were reflected in agricultural
trade. In the 1970s, the rapid growth in agricultural exports depended heavily on
soy products, orange juice, cocoa, tobacco and sugar. Of total agricultural
exports of US$2.09 billion in 1970, only 15% were accounted for by these five
crops. By 1980, they accounted for over 50% of Brazil's US$9.43 billion of
agricultural exports. After 1980, the value of agricultural exports hardly grew
at all, except in 1984, when coffee and orange juice were aided by highly
favorable price movements (Annex 1, Table 2).
Current Agricultural Development Policy
2.04      The primary objective of the Government's agricultural policy is to
restimulate sectoral growth after several years of declining investment and
relatively low output growth. Target growth rates for 1986-1989 in the National
Development Plan are 5% per year for the sector as a wholc, 4.5% for food crops
and 5.5% for export crops. The target increase in the cultivated area by 1989 is
3 million hectares for food crops and 1.5 million hectares for export crops. In
addition to expanding the area under production, the plan calls for increased farm
productivity through expanded use of irrigation and further emphasis on research
and extension. The plan puts emphasis on land reform as a means of reducing
economic and social inequalities in rural areas. A reduction in regional
inequalities is to be achieved by directing public investment to those areas most
in need, especially the North/Northeast. As discussed in the National Development
Plan, Government action to meet its objectives for the agricultural sector will
focus on six policy areas: (a) price stabilization; (b) increased farm
productivity; (c) expanded cropped area and agricultural infrastructure;
(d) agrarian reform; (e) trade; and (f) rural credit.
Agricultural Technical Support Services
2.05      The two major technical services that can be expected to have a key
effect on increasing agricultural productivity and production are the generation
of new technology, through research, and the extension of that technology to the



-4-
farmer. Brazilian agricultural research and extension services are briefly
described below.
2.06      Agricultural Research.  The Brazilian Company for Agricultural Research
(EMBRAPA) is the institution responsible for promoting, coordinating and executing
a Government-sponsored research program throughout Brazil: the National
Agricultural Research Program (PRONAPA). It comprises regional (natural resource-
oriented), national commodity-based (production-oriented), and state-level
(adaptive and production-oriented) research programs. The Bank supported
Agricultural Research I and II Projects (Loans 1249-BR and 2016-BR) have had a
significant impact on the institutional and technical capacity of EMBRAPA to
implement these research programs.l/ During 1976-85 PROi,APA produced about 75
regional and crop specific technology packages or production systems. However,
this new technology has not been widely adopted by the small farmers, and, with
the assistance of the extension services, EMBRAPA now intends to identify the
reasons for this low rate of adoption and take corrective measures, particularly
in the new areas now being brought under cultivation.
2.07      Agricultural Extension Services.  At the Federal level, the Brazilian
Technical Assistance and Rural Extension Company (EMBRATER) formulates,
coordinates, monitors and evaluates the National System for Technical Assistance
and Rural Extension (SIBRATER). Field level extension activities are carried out
by associate state companies (EMATERs) or territorial agencies (ASTERs); with the
sole exception of the extension agency in the State of Sao Paulo, these agencies
are part of SIBRATER. EMBRATER's strategy and commodity emphases in the provision
of extension services are guided by the Government's objectives of:
(a) guaranteeing adequate supplies of reasonably priced food in the domestic
market; (b) increasing opportunities for rural employment; (c) crsating exportable
commodity surpluses where tiare is a comparative advantage; (d) encouraging
agroindustry processing of food products and related services; (e) improving the
standard of living for rural families and strengthening community ties; and
(f) preserving the natural resource base and protecting the environment.
2.08      The number of farms in the area covered by SIBRATER (i.e., excluding the
State of Sao Paulo), is estimated at about 4.9 million, including the more than
4.0 million small farms (less than 100 ha each) which comprise the main target
group for the agricultural extension service (Annex 1, Table 5). Currently, only
1.2 million farms, or 24% of the total, have access to agricultural extension
services under SIBRATER. Extension coverage varies by region, with 16-17% in the
lesser-developed North and Northeast regions; 30%, Centerwest; 34%, Southeast; and
39%, South. These regional variations partly reflect large differentials in
productivity of existing extension staff. In the South and Southeast regions
where there has been greater experimentation with the use of group extension
methods, the ratios of farmers to extensionist are about 120 to 1, as compared to
the Ncrtheast (99 to 1), the Centerwest (88 to 1), and the North (77 to 1)
(Annex 2, Tables 1, 2 and 3). EMBRATER plans an increase in overall extension
coverage from 1.2 to 2.6 million farms over the period 1986-89. This would
require a substantial increase in the efficiency of the existing extension
service, drawing on the experience of the southern regions with the use of group
extension methods.

Experience," OED, September 1, 1983.



-5-
2.09      The imp( tance of social extension and community development services
being provided by th" extension agencies as a complement to their purely
agricultural extension work is now baing more fully recognized.  These services
include the provision r-f technical support to rural families in developing
alternative income opportunities (e.g., home vegetable gardens, homecrafts), and
to youth and farmer associations. Currently, about 534,625 rural families and
1,815 youth groups are benefitting from these servicea. A substantial expansion
in the coverage of these services is planned (para. 3.09).
Bank Involvement in the Agricultural Sector
2.10      The Bank has made 33 loans, totaling US$2,026.2 million, for
agricultural and rural development in Brazil. These include one agricultural
credit and export loan for US$303.0 million and one supplemental financing loan
for US$30.5 million, both under the Special Action Program; three, amounting to
US$519.2 million, for agroindustries; two, tozaling US$60.5 million, for livestock
development; one for US$18.2 million for grain storage; two, amounting to US$100
million for agricultural research; one for US$100 million for agricultural
extension; one for US$100 million for a Land Tenure Improvement Project; and 21,
totaling US$794.8 million, for various settlement, irrigation and rural
development projects, 15 of which are located in the Northeast, two in Minas
Gerais, and four in the North and Northwest.
2.11      The Project Completion Report for the Lower Sao Francisco Polders
Project (Loan 1153-BR) showed that beneficiaries' net incomes increased beyond
original estimates, and small farmers were capable of moving successfully from
subsistence to commercial agriculture. The PCR for the Agricultural Research I
Project (Loan 1249-BR) indicated that the project achieved the goals set at
appraisal, and institution building effects of that project have been particularly
evident. However, it pointed out that technology transfer linkages to the farmer,
through the extension system, required further improvement.
Experience with Past Bank Lending - The Agricultural Extension I Project
2.12      The Agricultural Extension I Project (Loan 1568-BR) became effective on
September 22, 1978, and was to be completed in four years. Early difficulties,
due mainly to changes at the Federal Government level in 1978, resulted in a delay
of almost two years. Some funding restrictions during 1982/83 created a further
one-year lapse. As a result, project completion was delayed until December 31,
1985, or about seven years from the date of effectiveness. However, there were no
project cost overruns mainly because of the Government's policy of devaluing the
cruzeiro in line with domestic inflation (Cr$ 15.54 - US$1.00 at appraisal and
Cr$ 10,310 - US$1.00 at end December, 1985). Moreover, staff salaries did not
keep pace with inflation. The broad objective of the first project was to
strengthen EMBRATER's capability to provide national leadership and overall
coordination in order to create more efficient and effective extension service
agencies at the state level. This was to be done by improvements in the
institutional infrastructure, development of communications systems, smaff
training and technical assistance.
2.13      Although the PCR for the first project is not due until mid-1986, a
recent Bank supervision mission identified its positive and negative results.
Among the positive aspects were the significant increase in the number of better
trained extension agents and improvements in extension methodology through the



-6-
greater use of field demonstration plots, as well as of printed materials, radio
and audio-visual programs. These advances have greatly increased the
institutional capability of SIBRATER as a whole. Among suggestions for improving
negative aspects were: (a) more effective project coordination by the government
agencies concerned; (b) higher priority for essential research-extension linkages;
(c) more emphasis on the social/community development area and greater recognition
of the role of social extension in agricultural production; and (d) more attention
to farm economics training of extensionists to enable them to evaluate more fully
the risk factor as an element preventing adoption of new technology. During the
last two years of implementation the first project was modified to include social
extension and community development services. Further information on the lessons
learned, from other Bank agricultural extension projects and projects with
extension components, is provided in Annex 2, Appendix 1.
III. THE PROJECT
Project Background and Rationale
3.01      The project originated as a follow-up to the Agricultural Extension I
Project. The original project proposal was prepared by EMBRATER in July 1984 and
was subsequently revised with some limited assistance from Bank staff missions
which visited Brazil between March and July 1985. The project was appraised
during August-September of 1985, and negotiation, took place in Washington, D.C.,
from March 5-11, 1986. The Brazilian delegation was headed by Ms. Patricia Goes
Bakaj of the Ministry of Planning.
3.02      Although considerable progress has been achieved under the Agricultural
Extension I Project in strengthening SIBRATER (para. 2.12), the Government's
long-term goals of adequate institutional strengthening and effective delivery of
agricultural extension services to all farmers, particularly in the lesser
developed regions of the North, Northeast, and Centerwest, have not yet been fully
realized. Further Bank assistance is warranted to consolidate the progress
achieved under the first project and to support the proposed wider coverage of
extension services. An additional justification for continued Bank support of
Brazil's extension services is that the country is Just beginning to achieve
significant results from applied research programs.±/ Adequate returns to this
capital investment in agricultural research cannot be achieved unless there is
further improvement in extension services. The project would also supplement the
various federal/state level technical assistance and information services which
provide key inputs for the rural development, land settlement, land resource,
credit and agroindustry projects which are currently receiving financing under
Bank loans.
Project Objectives and Description
3.03      The project would aim to increase the scope, efficiency and effective-
ness of SIBRATER. In order to achieve this objective the project would: (a)
strengthen the coordinating and Implementing agencies (EMBRATER, EMATERs, ASTERs);
(b) expand and improve extension services; (c) change the extension methodology

from the present, traditional system of individual contact approach to a group
approach; (d) intensify essential farmer/extension/research linkages; (e) provide
training, technical assistance and required studies; and (f) expand social
extension, community development services and the role of women. The project
would continue the regional focus of the Agricultural Extension I Project on the
North, Northeast and Centerwest regions where, despite the gains achieved so far,
the quality and coverage of extension services still remain much less than those
in the more developed South and Southeast regions. The following paragraphs
summarize the main activities to be carried out under the project
(Annex 2).
3.04      Strengthen the Management and Coordination of SIBRATER.  The project
would strengthen the coordination among federal and state implementing agencies
and improve administrative and operational efficiency by: (a) identifying
constraints and implementing necessary procedural and staffing changes, based on
an analysis of tasks to be performed and of the corresponding skill gap and
perceived requirements; (b) preparing suitable training course curricula based on
this analysis; (c) adding 30 staff to 48 existing project-related staff
positions;2/ and (d) providing necessary infrastructure (two state offices),
equipment for data collecti6n and about 513 field service vehicles.
3.05      Expand and Improve Field Extension Services.  The project would
increase the efficiency and effectiveness of field extension services by:
(a) further training of about 3,600 field staff that were recruited and trained
under the first project (para. 3.03 (e)); (b) constructing 1,666 local field
offices in remote areas and renovating 150 existing offices; and (c) providing
equipment, office furnishings and 4,500 field service vehicles. This would enable
SIBRATER to improve agricultural extension services to the 1.2 million producers
now receiving these services and to extend the coverage to an additional 700,000
producers. In terms of municipalities covered, the number would increase from
2,600 (60% of all municipalities) to about 2,900 (74%).
3.06      Change Extension Methodology.  The project would emphasize a group
contact approach, based on methodology studies carried out under the first project
(Annex 2, Appendix 2). It would provide for: (a) the addition of 40 staff to 114
existing project-related staff positions; (b) the acquisition, production and
dissemination of books, pamphlets, audio-visual and other materials; (c) the
acquisition of about 80 mobile audio-visual units, equipment to prepare
audio-visual programs, 85 radio units, 780 field service vehicles and inputs for
some 15,000 on-farm demonstration plots; and (d) training for 3,400 new farm youth
group leaders.
3.07      Intensify Farmer/Extension/Research Linkages.  Intensifying these
linkages would provide adequate feedback from farmers to researchers under the
PRONAPA (EMBRAPA) program so that on-farm problems could be addressed through
changes in research program emphasis. Specifically, the project would provide
for: (a) the addition of 33 staff to 44 existing project-related staff positions;
(b) frequent research/extension staff contacts through designated liaison staff at
the experiment station and state program level; (c) about 1,500 farm/research
station study tours to promote research/extension interaction and to review
priorities, and an annual research program planning exercise to reflect farmers'

project.



-8-
needs; (d) Joint research/extension staff participation in on-farm observation and
demonstration plots (para. 3.06); and (e) production of audio-visual ad printed
materials developed from (c) above.
3.08      Provide Training, Technical Assistance and Studies.  The project would
include:  (a) pre-service training courses for 5,000 incremental and/or
replacement staff and in-service training courses, averaging one course per year,
for all technical field staff (16,500) in the entire extension system;
(b) subject-matter specialist training in soil conservation, irrigation systems
management, the rational use and control of agrochemicals, and farm management;
(c) construction of 27 training centers and 381 field practice teaching units at
50 training centers; (d) provision of equipment for the 27 new training centers;
and (e) technical assistance to EMBRATER through the addition of 72 staff to the
existing 112 project-related staff, assisted by nine man-years of consultancy
services for the studies on the administrative strengthening of federal and state
operations, monitoring and evaluation, extension methodology, research and
extension linkages and sources of financing for SIBRATER. This latter study would
aim at identifying new sources of financing for SIBRATER, including the
introduction of charges for extension services being provided to medium and large
farmers.
3.09      Expand Social Extension, Community Development Services and the Role of
Women. Building on the experience under the first project, the project would
support the greater participation of women in increasing farm family incomes, and
more generally, family well-being by: (a) providing production-related extension,
specifically for home vegetable gardens and orchards; (b) promoting non-
agricultural, income-generating activities such as homecrafts; (c) promoting the
formation of producer groups (pre-cooperatives); and (d) providing social
extension to address matters of health, hygiene and nutrition. Towards this end,
the project would involve: (a) adding 550 field staff to the existing 111
project-related staff positions; (b) purchasing 500 field vehicles and equipment;
(c) purchasing 25 audio-visual mobile units; (d) developing social extension
training courses at 42 training centers; and (e) providing equipment for some 400
field units. This would enable social and community development services to be
extended to an additional 150,000 farm families, about 18,000 youth groups and
2,400 community councils.
Project Implementation
3.10      EMBRATER would implement the project at the national level, in
accordance with the terms of the contracts which would be entered into among the
Borrower, through its Ministry of Agriculture, EMBRATER and each of the states/
territories and the EMATERS/ASTERS. The signing of these contracts would be a
condition of disbursement of the Bank loan for each participating state and
territory (para. 4.04). Under the coordination of EMBRATER, project-related
activities would be implemented in: the 22 participating states in the federation,
i.e., all states with the exception of Sao Paulo which historically has not been
part of the national extension system; the two territories (Roraima and Amapa) and
the Federal District. Following procedures currently in force for the
Agricultural Extension I Project, EMBRATER would ensure that: (a) each associate
company is provided with guidelines on all fiscal, planning ard functional details
of project implementation; (b) annual budget requirements are met; (c) monitoring
and evaluation procedures are fo'llowed; and (d) specific project-related studies
are implemented. During negotiations, EMBRATER provided an assurance that each



- 9 -
EMATER and ASTER would designate a Project Coordinator to coordinate project
implementation with EMBRATER's Planning and Coordination Unit (NUPIN) in Brasilia
(para. 4.02). EMBRATER also provided assurances that it would furnish the Bank
for its review and comment: (a) by September 30 of each year, the guidelines
regarding priority programs, regions and target groups for use by the EMATERs and
ASTERs in connection with the preparation of their annual operational plans
(POAs); and (b) by November 30 of each year, the proposed POAs of the EMATERs and
ASTERs for the following year (para. 4.02).
3.11      With reference to the studies to be conducted, EMBRATER has agreed to
give high priority to the study of alternative sources of financing for SIBRATERo
During negotiations, EMBRATER provided assurances that the consultants for the
study on financing SIBRATER would initiate their work by June 30, 1986, and that
the results of the study would be presented to the Bank for review by December 31,
1986 (para. 4.02).
3.12      Under the contractual arrangements referred to in para. 3.10 above, the
EMATERs and ASTERs would implement the project at the field level. They would:
(a) execute civil works and make capital investments following procedural
guidelines approved by the federal project coordinator; (b) execute project
components at the field level in accordance with the previously approved work
program; and (c) submit the necessary accounting documentation and monitoring
reports on project progress as outlined in the project implementation guidelines
(Annex 2). A condition of disbursement of the Bank loan for each state/territory
would be the presentation by EMBRATER to the Bank of the POA of the respective
EMATER/ASTER for the first year of project implementation (para. 4.04).
Project Costs
3.13      The total cost of the project over the eight-year implementation period
(1986-93) is estimated at US$349.1 million, of which about US$117.5 million, or
34%, represents foreign exchange. Inysical contingencies were calculated at the
rate of 10% on civil works, equl-.S..nt, furnishings, books and publications,
resulting in overall average physical contingencies amounting to 6% of the base
costs. Price contingencies (22% of base costs) have been estimated at 7.2% for
1986, 6.8% for 1987 and 1988, 7% for 1989, 7.1% for 1990 and 4.0% for 1991-93.
Price contingencies were applied to all components except salaries. No price
contingencies in dollar terms have been provided for the project's salary costs,
in line with the Government's objective of controlling the growth of public sector
operating expenditures. The base cost of US$272.6 million was estimated from
August 1985 prices and adjusted to reflect April 1986 prices. In view of the wide
divergence between international and local inflation rates, all cost tables and
financial projections are presented in US dollars. The federal/state taxes and
duties on project-related purchases/services were calculated to be about US$38.0
million giving a total project cost, net of taxes, of US$311.1 million. The
project would require a total of 24 man-years of consultant services estimated at
about US$1.2 million. (Details of project costs are showa in Annex 3, Tables 1, 2
and 3.)
Financing Plan
3.14      The proposed Bank loan of US$155.0 million would be for 15 years,
including three years of grace, and would finance 50% of project costs, net of
US$38.0 million in taxes and US$1.1 million in reserve procurement for computer



- 10 -
equipment, or 44% of total project costs. The Government, through specific budget
allocations to EMBRATER, would finance US$104.5 million (30%); the remaining
US$89.6 million (26%) would be financed by the state/territorial governments.
Based on experience with the first project, the participation of the states/
territories in the financing of the project is a feasible arrangement, although
occasional delays may be incurred by individual states/territories in providing
counterpart funds. The shares of the Government and of each of the state/
territorial governments, in the financing of the project, would be specified in
the contracts referred to above (pars. 3.10). The allocation of counterpart funds
required for the first year of project implementation is a condition of loan
effectiveness (para. 4.03). (Details of the financing plan are given in the Loan
and Project Summary.)

a/  Values in parcntheses reflect amounts to be financed by Bank.  Further
details are shown in Annex 3, Table 4.
3.16      Civil works (US$68.3 million) would either be procured under local
competitive bidding (LCB) procedures satisfactory to the Bank (US$38.9 million),
or by force account (US$29.4 million). Local competitive bidding would be
justified as construction of some 27 units with an average unit cost of US$400,000
would be at widely scattered sites. Force account procedures would apply to 1,666
local offices (average unit cost of US$25,000) to be built in remote areas in the
24 states/territories and for 400 small field training centers (didactic units)
costing no more than US$10,000 per unit.
3.17      Vehicles (US$58.7 million) would comprise utility, off-the-road
vehicles, buses, pick-ups, motorcycles and boats supplied for use in 25
states/territories and the Federal District (DF). These units, mainly of
specialized types, would be procured in small lots according to need over a period
of eight years. Procurement would be through LCB procedures consistent with Bank
guidelines. Apart from the small size of individual contracts, which are not
likely to be attractive to foreign firms, procurement through LCB is warranted in



- 11 -
this case by the need to ensure fleet uniformity and a limitid number of vehicle
types. These are essential to the establishment of adequate maintenance
facilities including the timely availability of spare parts. In the rural
environment under which the project would operate, these facilities are of
critical importance for meeting the project's transportation requirements in the
most economical and efficient way.
3.18      Field equipment and furnishings (US$64.5 million) for training centers,
state headquarters and local offices would also be acquired through LCB
procedures. These purchases, in lots of approximately US$10,000 each, are
required at some 2,500 locations in remote areas and, as requirements are
locality- and crop-specific, cannot be aggregated into larger purchases. The
total cost of specialized equipment (audio-visual, communications, photographic
and printing equipment) is estimated at US$16.5 million, of which US$14.5 million
woul' be purchased through international competitive bidding (ICB). Small
quantities of specialized equipment, in lots less than US$200,000 each, but in the
aggregate amounting to no more than US$2.0 million would be purchased through
LCB. Farm hand tools and supply inputs (US$19.6 million) for use in training
centers and demonstration plots would be purchased in small quantities and amount
to no more than US$20,000 per contract. These would be acquired through prudent
shopping (at least three quotations) and reported under statements of
expenditure. All bidding packages for civil works contracts over US$1.0 million
and bidding packages for goods over US$250,000 (about 70% of total procurement)
would be subject to prior Bank review of bidding documents, bid evaluation and
award proposals. The balance of contracts would be subject to random post review
by the Bank after contract award. Consultant services (under technical assistance
contracts) would be selected in accordance with Bank guidelines. During
negotiations, EMBRATER provided assurances that it would follow the procurement
procedures outlined in paras. 3.15-3.18 (para. 4.02).
Disbursements
3.19      The proceeds of the loan would be disbursed against: 100% of the foreign
costs of staff training, equipment, materials and furnishings, consultants and
contracted studies; 60% of local costs of staff training and technical meetings;
50% of eligible salary costs, and of the costs of supervision, monitoring and
evaluation, vehicles and spare parts, equipment, civil works, methodology and
field demonstration inputs; and 50% of the local costs of equipment, materials and
furnishings. Disbursements against eligible salary costs would be at 50% of the
total cost on a declining basis as follows: Year 1, 80%; Year 2, 60%; Year 3,
40%; Year 4, 20% and 0% thereafter (Annex 3, Table 5). Disbursements for
purchases and contracts of less than US$250,000 would be made against statements
of expenditure initiated by the EMATERs/ASTERs and certified by EMBRATER.
Disbursements against salaries, training, inputs and materials would be made
against SOEs. Supporting documentation would not be submitted to the Bank but
retained by EMBRATER and made available for inspection by the Bank during
supervision missions. EMBRATER would submit standard documentation for contracts
of US$250,000 or more, to the Bank.
3.20      The proceeds of the loan are expected to be disbursed over an eight-year
period, in line with the historical disbursement profile for agricultural projects
in Brazil. The estimated schedule of disbursements is shown in Annex 3, Table 6.
The closing date for the loan would be June 30, 1994.



- 12 -
3.21      In order to maintain the momentum achieved under the first project, a
broad range of activities has already been initiated under this project. In order
to support the balanced implementation of the project, all project expenditures
(except for supervision, monitoring and evaluation), incurred prior to loan
signing but after January 1, 1986 would be eligible for reimbursement up to
US$12.0 million equivalent.
Special and Project Accounts
3.22      To reduce Government prefinancing requirements, a Special Account
would be opened in the Central Bank, with an initial deposit of up to US$8.0
million. The Government may request the Bank to make advance payments of
dollars from the loan account into this Special Account. Withdrawals in
cruzados from the Special Account would be supported by statements of
expenditure or other required documentation and payment would be made at the
exchange rate that prevailed on the date of expenditure. At agreed
intervals, the Central Bank would send the corresponding statements to the
Bank, which would then replenish the Special Account. The project would also
participate in the advance system of the Central Bank of Brazil. A Project
Account would be established by EMBRATER to receive monthly advances of project
funds (in cruzados) from the Central Bank, which would subsequently be reimbursed
to the Central Bank by payments from the Special Account. During negotiations,
the Government provided assurances that the project would participate in the
Central Bank system of advancing project counterpart funds (para. 4.01).
Accounts and Audit
3.23      EMBRATER would keep separate accounts of expenditures made under
the project. Certificates of expenditures, including satisfactory evidence
of incremental staff salaries, would be made available to the Bank for review
in Brasilia upon request. (EMBRATER's internal audit procedures are
described in Annex 2, Table 7.) During negotiations, the Government provided
assurances that EMBRATER would have project accounts audited by independent
auditors, in accordance with sound auditing principles acceptable to the Bank, and
that such audits would be submitted to the Bank no later than six months after the
close of each fiscal year (para. 4.01).
Monitoring and Evaluation
3.24      Monitoring.  Physical and financial monitoring of progress on the
project would be the responsibility of the project coordinator at the
EMATER/ASTER level, and progress reports would be submitted to EMBRATER every
three months. The project coordinating unit (NUPIN) in EMBRATER would then
consolidate these reports to provide: (a) quarterly progress reports on
incremental staff and selected key indicators (Annex 2, Tables 4, 5, 6 and 8); and
(b) semi-annual progress reports; (c) a Project Completion Report to be submitted
to the Bank within six months of project completion. By December 31, 1989, or
when 50% (US$77.5 million) of the loan has been disbursed, whichever is earlier,
the Bank and EMBRATER would jointly review progress made under the project and
measure the extent to which project objectives are being achieved. These
arrangements are similar to the procedures used in the first project which were
found to be satisfactory. During negotiations, EMBRATER provided an assurance
covering the mid-term review above (para. 4.02).



- 13 -
3.25      Evaluation.  Assumptions concerning actual impact on change and the rate
of adoption of new technology by farmers, with subsequent increases in yields have
been particularly difficult to assess. EMBRATER's Monitoring and Evaluation (M&E)
Group, which was established under the first project, has made limited progress in
evaluating the effects of extension. The Group's findings have been used to
calculate the estimated economic rate of return (ERR) for the project (Annex 4,
Table 1). As part of the design of the M&E studies to be carried out under the
project (Annex 2), several groups of farmers would be selected for control
purposes in each region to permit a valid impact analysis to be made. The M&E
Group would monitor and analyze data on advancee in research, their relation to
the technical assistance offered and the extent to which the recommendations are
adopted at farm level.
Beneficiaries, Incremental Production and Marketing
3.26      Beneficiaries.  The direct beneficiaries of the project would be the
additional 700,000 farmers receiving extension services for the first time. About
70% of these farmers have incomes below the poverty level (defined as two minimum
salaries per farm family, equivalent to US$310 per capita per annum, assuming an
average family size of five). In addition, as part of the project's social
extension and community development activities, some 150,000 rural families would
benefit from assistance in education, health, nutrition and instruction in
homecraft activities to improve family incomes. Apart from these direct
beneficiaries, the 1.2 million farmers who now have access to extension services
would also benefit from the increased efficiency and effectiveness of the entire
national extension service network.
3.27      Incremental Production.  Although the project is expected to have an
impact over a wide range of crops, only nine crops and two livestock activities
(swine, cattle) were used in the economic analysis as being most representative of
the production patterns of the target group. For the nine crops there would be
(national) production increases of 2.5% per year, such that the production levels
at project maturity (1993) would exceed the corresponding levels in 1985 by the
following amounts: cotton, 42,000 t; rice, 208,000 t; beans, 62,000 t; manioc,
271,000 t; maize, 446,000 t; soybeans, 903,000 t; garlic, 7,000 t; tomatoes,
49,000 t; and potatoes, 45,000 t. For livestock enterprises, similar, modest
increments of 3-5% per year were estimated as being attributable to the project.
Nationally, these crops/livestock are produced on farms where direct extension
services are provided to areas representing between 28% and 70% of the total crop,
the exception being c-'tle (17%). (Details are provided in Annex 4, Table 2.)
3.28      Marketing.  Ithe incremental production generated by the project would be
marketed primarily in local, rural markets for basic food crops (beans, maize,
rice, potatoes and manioc) and garlic. Increments are well below expected demand
for these crops based on estimated population growth. Export or industrial crops,
i.e., cotton, soybeans and tomatoes, are also well within current demand
estimates. Both beef and milk are frequently imported to meet current needs.
Economic Analysis, Cost Recovery and Sustainability
3.29      Economic Analysis.  Based on conservative assumptions about potential
yields, estimated farmer participation, development period costs and prices, the
ERR is 26%. The sensitivity analyses indicate that even with a 20% rise in costs,



-  14  -
and a three-year lag in benefits, the return would be about 11% or the presently
estimated opportunity cost of capital. (Details of the economic analysis are
provided in Annex 4, Tables 2, 3.)
3.30      Cost Recovery.  While it is not Government policy to obtain full cost
recovery on rural development and services to low-income rural families, which are
the target population in this case, the Government would receive increased fiscal
revenues from the project-related incremental production. The value-added tax on
the incremental agricultural production (para. 3.27) would generate an estimated
US$15.8 million per annum at full developxment. Reven--s from the social security
tax levied at 2.5% of the value of marketed producti - vould provide a further
US$2.4 million annually. Thus, by project Year 7, the increased annual revenues
from those two main sources would be expected to offset about 50% of the annual
incremental recurrent costs resulting from project activities.
3.31      Sustainability.  Project costs must be viewed in relation to the overall
cost of the agricultural extension service network (SIBRATER) as a whole. In
comparison with actual and estimated budgets for the 1986-93 period, the project
cost would represent 31% of the overall budget in 1986 but only about 15% in
1993. Also, the fact that disbursements for recurrent incremental salary
expenditures are being made on a declining percentage basis (80-60-40-20%) during
the first four years of project implementation means that such costs must be
totally funded under normal SIBRATER budgeting procedures by project Year 5
(1990). The project also includes a study to review the current sources of
funding for the SIBRATER system and to identify other long-range funding sources
(para. 3.08).
Project Risks
3.32      The four main risks are: (a) problems of institutional coordination in
achieving expected administrative efficiency; (b) the degree to which appropriate
new production packages are available; (c) the degree to which thesf packages are
accepted by farmers; and (d) delays in counterpart funding which could occur
particularly at the state level. Much was achieved under the first project to
improve institutional coordination between the federal and state levels. In
designing and preparing the proposed project, institutional constraints were
clearly defined and would be remedied through appropriate staff training
programs. The proposed closer linkages between the farmer/extensionist/research
scientist have been specifically designed to ensure that the problems of the
farmer are being addressed by the research scientist and consequently that these
new production packages would be increasingly available for adoption by the
farmers. The degree of risk that the uptake of new technology, even if
well-advertised and promoted, would be minimal or slow depends partly on
production incentives as well as structural factors beyond the scope of the
project (e.g., the land tenure system and the associated high level of risk
aversion of farmers who have little or no secure access to land). This risk is
manageable considering the successful experience under the first project and the
priority being accorded by the Government to agricultural priclng and trade
policies and the land tenure system. With the increased priority being given to
extension services by the Federal and State governments, the risk related to the
timely provision of counterpart funds would be minimized. Furthermore, the study
on the alternative sources of financing for SIBRATER (para. 3.08) would provide

BRAZIL
AGRICULTURAL EXTENSION II PROJECT
PROJECT IMPLEMENTATION  /
A. Organization and Management
Headquarters Administration
1.        EMBRATER would have full responsibility for the formulation of
project policy and directives to ensure that the project achieves the
desired objectives. To this end, it would coordinate the essential phases
of project planning, execution, monitoring and evaluation of results at the
total project (federal) level. Execution and actual implementation of
project programs at the field level, would be the responsibility of the
associate companies (EMATERs and ASTERs), working through the state or
territorial offices as the case may be. Project staffing has been
evaluated and 28 incremental staff included as necessary to carry out the
tasks assigned. Under the first project EMBRATER designated a pro,ect
coordinator in the Office of International Programs under the Coordination
of Planning (CPLAN) Department (NUPIN/CPLAN). This arrangement would
continue for the proposed project. Details of EMBRATER's organization,
staffing and field operations are provided in Tables 1-6 anu in Annex 6,
Charts 1-4.
Project Coordination and Liaison between Federal and State Levels
2.        As both the federal and state organizations have basically the
same administrative structure (Annex 6, Charts 1 and 2), the easy and
direct flow of communication between corresponding levels would continue as
at present. The office of the coordinator would, as in other areas of
administration, have direct access to counterpart staff in the Technical
Support Units of the state EMATERs and would be directly responsible to the
chief of EMBRATER's Planning Department (CPLAN).
Technical Support Units
3.        The coordinating officer in NUPIN/CPLAN would have overall
responsibility for execution of the project. The officer would also handle
project-related correspondence with the Bank through the office of the
Department of Operations and the Presidency of EMBRATER. The project
coordinator would be responsible for the submission of project progress
reports, at six monthly intervals, as required by the Bank. The necessary
technical and administrative services required by the project coordinator
to monitor the progress of project implementationt would be supplied by
those departments responsible, i.e., Planning (CPLAN), Program Development
(CODES), Administration and Finance (COAFI), and Operations (COPER). For
the supervision of the civil works component, the consultant services of
three civil engineering/architects would be provided under the technical
assistance component.
}/ Implementation Guidelines are provided in greater detail in Staff
Working Paper 4.

Budgeting of Programs at State Level
4.        All programs require close collaboration at the federal
(EMBRATER) and state (EMATER) levels. The fiscal year corresponds to the
calendar year for the (SIBRATER) system and the budgeting process commences
during September of the previous year in the department of operations in
each EMATER. These plans then pass to the programming and budgetary unit
for review and there undergo cost/finance reconciliation in the department
of administration and finance. When approved by the president's council,
the state (EMATER) budgets then go to EMBRATER headquarters in Brasilia. A
similar operational-planning-financial and edvisory board review takes
place at the EMBRATER level. However, federal policies on a regional
rather than state basis are considered, and state plans may be revised
accordingly. The Annual Operating Plans (POAs), as approved by EMBRATER,
would then be submitted to the Bank for review and comment no later than
November 30 of each year.
B. Project Components
Regional Emphasis
5.        As in the first project the major thrust of this follow-up
project is in the priority region comprising the north, northeast and
center-west (60% of project expenditures) and to a lesser degree in the
already more technologically advanced south and southeast (40%). For the
first project the priority emphasis by region was 66 and 34% respectively.
The slight shift in emphasis, towards the south and southeast, seems
justified on the basis of: (a) investments in extension services in the
northeast have already been considerable under the new Northeast
Development Program (PAPP) to which the Bank is contributing; and (b) the
Government's emphasis on the small farmer and on basic food crops is more
accurately addressed by the 60 to 40 percent regional distribution of
project benefits.
Institutional Strengthening
6.        Administrative and Operational Review.  The expansion and
improvement of extension services under the project implies that major
institutional changes would become necessary to shift the procedures and
mechanisms through which the extension work is carried out. Considerable
efforts would be necessary to improve the available institutional capacity
because the system would become reponsible for reaching out to many more
communities and because much of the substance of the extension work might
be defined within those communities. New organization and functional flows
and, therefore, new management and other skills would be required at all
levels. Management staff also would need to upgrade the understanding of
their roles and adjust to major changes in their procedures and development
performance in general. The institutional strengthening component is aimed
at supporting such efforts. This institutional strengthening will be
obtained through increased capacity for skill delivery. The use of
consultant services would be provided to assist the EMBRATER headquarters
and associate state companies (EMATERS) to complete the full skill gap
analysis of their operations (para. 12). The need for continued
institutional improvements has frequently been referred to in Bank assisted
extension projects (Appendix 1).

7.        Federal-State Linkages.  Under the project the role of the
federal institution vis-a-vis the state associate companies (EMATERS) and
territorial agencies (ASTERs) would also be strengthened and-unified under
amended contracts with each EMATER/ASTER. Such amendments would include:
(a) directives concerning the emphasis on the small farmer and specific
regional programs; (b) responsibilities for execution of the project
components as listed (paras. 6 to 15); (c) uniformity of administrative
departments with EMBRATER; and (d) revision of supervision responsibilities
at national, state, regional and local levels and their relationship to
each other. Need for any further administrative changes within the
(SIBRATER) system would be the subject of a study in project Year 1, to be
reviewed at project Year 3. Studies would also be carried out to:
(a) develop appropriate training curricula based on the skill gap analysis;
and (b) review actual and proposed alternative sources of financing for
state-level extension services (Table 9). The project would finance:
civil works for two state offices, field vehicles (486)and 27 mobile repair
vehicles; equipment and furnishings for the two state offices; audio-
visual, communications and printing equipment; salaries for the 30
incremental staff to be added to the 48 existing project-related staff
positions, and six man-years of consultancy service to carry out the
studies referred to above and incremental operating expenses. Baseline
costs for the institutional strengthening component would amount to US$15.5
million.
Expansion and Improvement of Extension Services
8.        Currently the extension system (SIBRATER) serves 2,559
municipalities or 65% of all municipalities in Brazil. At completion, a
total of 2,914 municipalities (74% of all municipalities) would have
received extension services under the project. The number of communities
to be assisted would increase by 17% from 28,148 to 32,934; the number of
farmers/producers by 54% from 1.3 million to about 2.0 million, and rural
families receiving social extension services by 30%, or from 510,000 to
about 660,000. The proposed expansion of services would mainly be brought
about by: (a) changes in methodology, i.e., group methods as opposed to
individual contracts (para. 9); (b) greater efficiencies in operations at
the field level; (c) better communications equipment; and (d) improved
infrastructure for local extension services at the agricultural frontier
(chiefly northwest and north regions) and corresponding increases in
transportation services and equipment to enable each field extension agent
to reach a greater number of farmers. Under the project it is expected
that each extension agent would contact 125-150 farmers as opposed to
75-100 farmers at present. In addition the 3,600 incremental field staff
initially contracted under the first project would receive further training
in the group-method approach. A description of the essential differences
between the current (traditional) extension method and the group-method is
given in Appendix 2. The project would finance: 4,204 field vehicles,
1,020 bicycles and 158 small river craft. Civil works for construction of
1,666 small (local) field offices and renovation of 150 existing field
offices; furnishings and equipment for field offices and salary costs for
the 3,600 existing project-related field staff and other operational
costs. Baseline costs for this component would be US$135.8 million.

Page 4
Extension Methodology
9.        Under the first project field testing was done to provide
information as to how extension services could be provide.d to more farmers
with greater efficiency and effectiveness. The previous (pre-project)
system was referred to as the traditional system and the new system as
"Group Approach' or 'convivencia" (Appendix 1). Under the proposed
project the latter system would be gradually introduced to all states and
modified consistent with local requirements, i.e., rural development,
settlement or well established agricultural regions. Further studies to
test modifications of the group method would continue. The project would
finance: 783 field vehicles, 77 mobile audio-visual units, equipment for
communications (audio-visual and radio), 15,000 on-farm observation and
demonstration plots and related inputs, and the necessary ,ncremental
salary costs for the 40 incremental staff to be added to the 114 existing
project-related staff positions and incremental operational costs.
Baseline costs for the component total US$36.3 million.
Farmer/Extension/Research Linkage
10.       Closely linked to extension methodology in the field is the need
to create adequate linkages to the national research programs under EMBRAPA
and to those at the state level (EMBRAPA's state level Experiment Station
Units (UEPAE) or those of the State Research Companies (UEPs). There is
now adequate administrative support for this to occur. Policy meetings at
the regional level have already taken place with the presidents of EMBRAPA
(research) and EMBRATER (Extension) participating. Basically the
objectives of greater collaboration between research, extension and the
farmer would be achieved through joint action in the following areas:
(a) exchange of visits, i.e., extension staff to research stations and
research staff to extension units in the field; (b) field observation plots
(OP.), which are on-farm testing of research results on farmers' fields;
(c) technical meetings, preparation of simple, farmr-oriented bulletins
based on OPs; and (d) interpretation and adaptation of existing research
data, found in technical bulletins to correspond to farmers' needs which
provides direct answers to his problems at the farm level. Currently, two
states, Espirito Santo and Santa Catarina have tested the Four methods
listed above and in the case of Espirito Santo formal guidelines have been
published (Annex 5). The project would finance: (a) initial studies and
formalization of research/extension linkages in each state; (b) about 1,600
farm/research station study tours for extension/research staff; (c) 233
field vehicles, communications and field demonstration inputs;
(d) production of audio-visual and printed materials; (e) 1.5 man-years of
consultancy services; and (f) incremental salaries for the 33 incremental
staff being added to the 44 existing project-related staff positions and
operating costs. The baseline costs of the component would be US$11.5
million.

Training. Technical Assistance and Studies
II.       Training is divided into four basic areas, i.e., (a) pre-service
(4,029 trainees); (b) in-service (82,159 trainees); (c) specialized short
courses (602 trainees); (d) post-graduate training (202 trainees); and (e)
about 105,00 farm level monitors. For all levels of training the curricula
of courses selected would be governed by the results of the analysis made
to define those areas where professional capacity is still lacking in order
to carry out assigned tasks (i.e., skill gap analysis). The preliminary
work necessary to apply this analysis at both the federal and state
extension agency levels was introduced during project preparation, was
partially implemented under the first project and would be fully
implemented under the proposed project. The number of trainees in each
category was estimated on the basis of the initial skill gap analysis
exercise.
12.       Technical assistance would be provided by 24 man years of
consultancy distributed as follows:

farmers would be aware of the

current research capabilities.
14.       The following would be financed under this component:
(a) training courses, (b) studies; (c) construction of 27 training centers
and 381 teaching units at a total of 50 training centers; (d) furnishings
to equip the 27 new training centers, salaries for the 72 incremental stafZ
being added to the 112 existing project-related staff positions and
incremental operational costs. The baseline costs of this component would
be US$47.4 million.
Social Extension. Community Development Services and the Role of Women
15.       The first project addressed itself exclusively to those
components thought to have the most direct impact on crop production, i.e.,
production technology working with farmers at the field level. Social
welfare in extension, emphasizing the farm family and the role of women,
was not supported during the first five years of project execution. At
EMBRATER's request this was later amended to permit social extension agents
to be funded under the project as it was seen that by assisting the farm
family as a unit the effect on agricultural production was further
improved. However, at the present low level of financial and staff



-28-                      ANNEX 2
Page 7
resources, the outreach to women has remalned very low. The proposed
project would: (a) assist in funding 550 incremental staff being added to
the III existing project-related staff positions; (b) provide methodology
studies; (c) revise the curriculum for social extension; (d) provide
specialized training for supervisory and administrative personnel; and
(e) promote greater integration of social and technical extension in
production functions, and the formation of youth and farmer associations.
The greater participation of women in increasing farm-family incomes would
be encouraged by including: (a) production-related extension, specifically
for home vegetable gardens and orchards, (b-) the formation of producer
groups (pre-cooperatives); (c) social extension to address matters of
health, hygiene and nutrition; and (d) non-agricultural income generating
activitles such as homecrafte. The project would also finance: 500 field
vehicles and 27 mobile audio-visual uni-a; communications equipment (radio
and audio-visual); inputs for community development work designed to
increase non-agricultural income for rural families though homecrafts and
limited production from home vegetable gardens and fruit orchards and the
incremental salary and operational costs. Details of this component are
provided in Staff Wdrking Paper 4. The baseline cost of this component
would be US$26.1 million.
16.       Implementation guidelines for all project components for the
first project year (1986) are given in Staff Working Paper 3. The
guidelines for project Years 2 - 8 would be submitted to the Bank by
July 31 of the previous year.
D. Monitoring and Evaluation
Monitoring
17.       Physical and financial monitoring of progress on the project
would be the responsibility of the project coordinator at the
state/territory (EMATER/ASTER) level and progress reports would be
submitted to EMBRATER every three months with four quarterly reports
covering the fiscal, i.e., calendar year. The project coordinating unit
(NUPIN) in EMBRATER would then consolidate these reports to provide:
(a) progress on selected key indicators; and (b) preparation of the
semi-annual progress report; and finally (c) a project completion report to
be submitted to the Bank within six months of project completion. This
completion report would also summarize the data obtained in the area of
project monitoring and evaluation.
Evaluation
18.       Significant and meaningful evaluation of extension services has
always been difficult. Assumptions concerning actual impact on change and
the rate of adoption of new technology by farmers, with subsequent
increases in yields have been particularlv difficult to assess. EMBRATER
has already made some limited progress in this area and this has been used
as a basis for calculating an estimated economic rate of return (ERR) for
the project. In order to further improve the validity of ERR calculations
on an ex-post rather than ex-ante basis, EMBRATER would set up
regional evaluation studies based on at least one representative state in
each of the five agro-ecological regions of the country. Guidelines for
these evaluation studies are provided In Staff Working Paper 3.

AGRICULTURAL EXTENSION II PROJECT
Lessons Learned from Bank Projects in the Sub-Sector
1.        Under lessons learned from other (Bank-wide) agricultural
extension projects, either free standing or with an extension component, a
total of 87 project PPARs were reviewed. of these only 2 were free
standing extension or extension and research projects. The remainder had a
significant extension component, which frequently was specifically
mentioned as contributing to the relative degree of success or otherwise
achieved by the project as a whole. Of the specific lessons learned by
these projects the most important are the following:
(a) extension organization and institutional strengthening of the
Implementing agency essential to success;
(b) the training of extension staff and farmers is an important
feature of such projects;
(c) extension services can improve greatly when there is adequate
"feed-back" from the farmer, i.e., a botton-up approach to
technological innovation;
(d) applied research and extension function is crucial to the success
of the project;
(e) long-term planning essential for building up the institutional
and staff capabilities of the extension service, particularly in
countries with a low educational base;
(f) lack of a proper monitoring and evaluation component is limiting
to project effectiveness;
(g) failure to properly assess the relative staffing and
institutional strengths at appraisal frequently leads to failure
of the entire project;
(h) extension agents poorly qualified to work with small-scale
farmers; rapid staff turnover also a contributing factor;
(i)  failure to promote farmer organizations; and
(j) recurrent cost implications must be considered.
2.        In addition to the direct lessons learned from experience with
the first project (Loan 1568-BR) guidance in preparing the proposed second
project was sought from these more general criteria developed from broad,
world-wide Bank experience with agricultural extension components/projects.

BRAZIL
AGRICULTURAL EXTENSION II PROJECT
Economic Justification
Production Targets and Extension Packages
1.        Assessments have been made of the main constraints on smallholder
yields of 12 of the more important commodities. Taking these constraints,
and possible corrective measures through extension methods, into account
the current average yields, agronomically feasible smallholder yields, and
expected yields with extension were calculated in each case. The estimated
incremental production averages were assumed to be significantly below what
is believed could be achieved under the normal (group approach) methodology
and commodity-specific extension prograes. These assessments are
summarized in Table 1. In many cases constraints are identified in areas
outside the purview of the extension effort: for examplc, the development
of new varieties by research services and the improvements in marketing and
credit arrangements and price policies. In most cases, however, yield
increases profitable to the smallholder are possible with improved
agricultural techniques based on existing research data and crop varieties
currently available and described in some 75 production systems.
Information on the current status of appropriate extension packages of
information to extend in each case was taken into account. It was
established that for 8 of the 12 crops/livestock operations selected, some
50 production systems, using appropriate technology, are applicable to
present conditions. Copies of this information are available in the
project file (Annex 5).
Benefit Estimation
2.        An accurate economic assessment of the proposed project is
difficult for several resons. First, its implementation and impact would
be dispersed throughout Brazil, and across the entire range of agricultural
enterprises but with emphasis on smallholder activity. Secondly, other
variables such as research results, availability of inputs, and attitudes
and response of farmers to new technology all affect the estimation of
benefits in every agroecological region. Finally, it is difficult to
isolate with any degree of accuracy the effects of extension from those of
research, improved inputs, weather trends, changes in relative prices and
marketing systems. Other factors affecting these calculations include
general improvements in education and access to mass media, and programs of
investment in transport, agricultural and irrigation infrastructure, etc.
Also the pattern of response (i.e., uptake of technology) by the farmer
requires a much broader data base than was available in this case. The
following economic analysis is therefore presented as a broad indicator of
the economic rate of return for the project based on an identification of
certain key parameters and applying conservative but reasonable values for
these parameters (Table 1).



-48-                      ANNEX 4
Page 2
3.        Potential Incremental Yields.  The assessments of the potential
impact of the project were narrowed to a few selected commodites which
would be emphasized in this project and which would be readily amenable to
production increases through improved extension. These include the major
food crops (rice, maize, cassava, beans, potatoes) and small-scale
livestock enterprises such as dual-purpose cattle (milk and beef) and
swine. Estate crops (soybeans, and cotton) and two important horticultural
crops: tomatoes and garlic. For these commodities, a potential Incremental
yield was estimated based on a projected impact of extension alone (Table
2) assuming only relatively simple Improvements in cultivation practices
and minimum increase in purchase inputs and no major on-farm investmentr.
These assumed yield increments are far below both the genetic potential of
improved varieties and increases attainable with more intensive specialized
programs. Also it has been noted that, particularly with the basic food
and horticultural crops, new technology even if readily available, is not
adopted by the small farmer, to any significant degree, unless technical
assistance from the extension system Is available.
4.        Farmer Participation.  Farmer participation was projected on past
experience and on a model of the actual implementation of extension at the
field level. The actual percentage of the national crop area currently
receiving extension coverage was used in the base calculation. The
percentage of each crop which is currently receiving the benefit of
technical assistance inputs is shown in Table 2.
5.        For each crop and livestock enterprise, it was assumed that the
potential incremental yield would be achieved by the farmers reached using,
as a proxy, the actual percentage of production area, for each
crop/livestock enterprise based on current (1984/85) crop data. Based on
the broader level of coverage, i.e., an additional 700,000 farmers and the
efficiencies in the quality of services which are estimated to be
(conservatively) feasible in each case, this increase was then calculated
to be some 25% over the current level of coverage, i.e., pre-project. It
was also assumed that farmer participation would reflect, at maturity, the
level of adoption as currently recorded. However, the rate of adoption
over time would be gradual, i.e., 3%, 9%, 28%, 43%, 55% and 60% over the
first six years of the project.
6.        Development Period.  The total incremental production, due to the
project, is given in Table 2. It is assumed that field ard horticultural
crops would commence after one year, swine after three years and cattle
(dual purpose beef and dairy) after five years.
7.        Prices and Costs.  For cassava, potatoes and tomato which are not
widely traded by the small farmer, actual farm gate (September 1985) prices
were used and a calculation made for the 1986 constant dollar price. All
other commmodities quoted, i.e., cotton, rice, beans, garlic, maize,
soybeans, beef, milk and pork are heavily traded, and a border price based
on the appropriate 1986-92 world price projection was used. To offset
incremental costs, due to the use of new technology, i.e., improved seed,
etc., the gross benefits for each commodity were reduced by 21X (Table 2),

8.        Rate of Return and Sensitivity Analysis.  The indicative project
economic rate of return based on the foregoing set of conservative
assumptions is about 26%. Sensitivity analyses indicate that costs could
rise by 20%, benefits could lag by three years, and the ERR would be about
11%, or the opportunity cost of capital (Table 3).
9.        Poverty Impact.  The direct beneficiaries of the project would be
the additional 700,000 farmers receiving extension services for the first
time. About 70% of these farmers have incomes below the poverty level
(defined as two minimum salaries per farm family, equivalent to US$310 per
capita per annum, assuming an average family size of five). No attempt has
been made to analyze the specific income effects on these farm families.
However, a sampling of farm models1/ for farms adopting new technology
showed that average farm incomes might increase by US$507 per annum (from
US$904 to US$1,411) for the crop model and by US$1,182 per annum (from
US$975 to US$2,157) for the mixed crop/livestock model. The corresponding
rates of return for the models were 31% (crop) and 39% (livestock)
respectively.
