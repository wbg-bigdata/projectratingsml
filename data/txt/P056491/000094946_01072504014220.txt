3. Assessment of Development Objective and Design, and of Quality at Entry
3.1 Original Objective:
Background. On January 10, 1998 an earthquake of magnitude 6.2 on the Richter scale occurred on the
Ba Shang plateau in Hebei Province. The quake caused extensive damage to a rural area of some 2,600 sq.
Iam, with a population of some 470,000 people living in 37 townships and 2,400 villages. Forty-nine deaths
and 11,439 injuries were recorded, and some 44,000 were left homeless. Furthermore a total of 136,000
rooms collapsed and an additional 264,000 rooms were damaged. This loss of adequate shelter during
Hebei's severe winter weather took a heavy toll on the population.
The area affected by the earthquake was Zhangjiakou (ZJK) municipality, located in north-west Hebei
province, and consists of four counties: Zhangbei, Wanquan, Kangbao and Shangyi. The epicenter of the
earthquake was on the border of Zhangbei and Shangyi counties. The altitude of the Ba Shang plateau
varies from 1,300 - 1,600 meters above sea level. Average annual temperature on the plateau is 2.6 C, and
the lowest recorded temperature is -35 C. Water resources are scarce and the area support dry land
agriculture, with limited areas of irrigation using ground water. Soil conditions are poor and the economic
base is very weak, with annual household incomes of the order of RMB 4,000 (US$500). The total direct
economic loss was estimated at US$300 million, of which rural housing losses were valued at US$200
million.
Project Objectives. The primary objective was to assist in the restoration of economic and social activities
following an earthquake in northwest Hebei Province, through the restoration of social and economic
infrastructure.  A second objective was to strengthen the socio-economic situation in the area through
enhancement of productive activities which would alleviate extreme poverty.
Evaluation of Objectives: The project objectives were clear, realistic, important. IDA's assistance focused
on short-term recovery and reconstruction to meet the needs of the population that was suffering hardship
from the severe winter weather. The project was consistent with the CAS objectives through its emphasis
on poverty alleviation by providing income-generating assets and protecting well-being. This broader
objective of fostering economic growth in an impoverished part of the region and restoring or providing
additional sources of income to a vulnerable population, was very relevant and important for the borrower.
3.2 Revised Objective:
n.a.
3.3 Original Components:
The Hebei Earthquake Rehabilitation Project supported emergency reconstruction, repair and rehabilitation
programs to be carried out in Hebei Province (HP). The components and costs follow.
a) Housing (US$12.6 million): reconstruction and/or repair of about 15,000 to 20,000 houses;
b) Health Care (US$1.6 million):  reconstruction and/or repair of about 26 healthcare facilities, and
purchase of equipment;
c) Grain Storage (US$2.8 million): reconstruction of and/or repairs to about 25,600 m2 of grain storage
facilities;
d) Water Conservancy (US$5.4 million): (i) reconstruction of and/or repairs to 30 drinldng water facilities,
- 2 -



including distribution networks; (ii) reconstruction of and/or repairs to water conservancy facilities, e.g.,
730 wells, buildings, canals, bridges, aqueducts, etc.; and (iii) repairs to the Friendship reservoir;
e) Education (US$10.4 million): reconstruction of about 600 schools and purchase of equipment;
f) Irrigation Development (US$7.7 million): (i) installation of 4500 shallow stone weels, 300 large dug
wells and 200 tube wells; and (ii) installation of some 500 small sprinkler irrigation systems; and
g) Institutional Development (US$0.1 million): technical assistance, training and support to municipal,
county and township level agencies, particularly for building standard development, project management
and monitoring.
Assessment of Design: The scope and design of the project were appropriate to meet the objectives of the
project, and were clear and in line with other IDA emergency operations and in China. The design took
into account lessons learned from other emergency earthquake relief interventions such as: (a) the
importance of selectivity in determining which types of infrastructure to focus on (schools, housing, water
conservancy) and which to exclude in the short term (roads and communications); (b) the importance of
simplicity (the project was designed to be simple to implement); and (c) the importance of consulting with
local communities. The assessed damage due to the earthquake was estimated at $300 million, including
damage to private properties for an amount of $200 million.
Despite reconstruction needs in a wide variety of subsectors, the project's design was rightly selective, and
did not include the reconstruction of major infrastructure assets, such as highways, or the provision of
assets and goods that could be re-built or reconstituted by the residents themselves, such as houses
interiors. While additional components could have been added to achieve the reconstruction objectives, the
selection was made taling into account the inexperience of the local counterparts and implementing agency
with Bank-funded projects. Striking the right balance in project design was facilitated by several Bank staff
who had worked on other earthquake rehabilitation programs in China. The close participation by the local
agencies (at all levels of administration) during appraisal helped ensure that accurate designs and estimates
were made, so only marginal adjustments to the project scope were made during implementation.
3.4 Revised Components:
n.a.
3.5 Quality at Entry:
There was no Quality at Entry assessment nor QAG analysis during the course of the project. The rating
for quality at entry is highly satisfactory. The quality of project design was good. It was simple, hence
ensuring that implementation would not be hampered by the need to deal with complex and different
objectives. The project's objectives were consistent with the CAS and the borrower's priorities. The only
applicable safeguard policy, namely environmental assessment, was satisfactorily adhered to. The project's
simple design and focus on established priorities helped ensure its sustainability.
4. Achievement of Objective and Outputs
4.1 Outcome/achievement of objective:
The Hebei Earthquake project achieved its objectives and reached or exceeded its expected outcome and is
rated highly satisfactory. The project aimed at rebuilding the economic, social and physical assets that were
destroyed by the earthquake, with a view of restoring essential facilities and services in the shortest possible
- 3 -



time. These objectives were achieved in a rapid and consistent manner. The project helped restore
economic, social, and physical assets destroyed by the earthquake and developed measures to reduce
vulnerability to seismic damage. The project's contribution at the end of the reconstruction effort was
substantial. It is estimated that the project contributed to 10% of the housing reconstruction, 100% of the
hospital and 100% of the schools. The poverty alleviation component of the project also brought benefits
and supplemental income to the local population beyond original expectations.
4.2 Outputs by components:
Physical achievements: The physical achievements of the project are considered highly satisfactory. An
evaluation of the infrastructure components indicates that the project has outperformed its targets.
Restoration of all residential premises was completed before the start of the 1998/99 winter season. Entire
villages in Zhangbei County, the area most affected by the earthquake, were rebuilt in a period of only
seven months. This was a formidable task considering the diversity of the works, and the difficult logistics
caused by the geographical dispersion of the various activities. The project was very successful in using
local building contractors, mostly due to the simplified procurement arrangements adopted, which
contributed to speedy implementation.
The impact of the project on the rehabilitation of private houses, schools and hospital was very significant
and physical targets exceeded appraisal estimates (see table below). A total of 26 health centers, clinic,
hospitals were rebuilt to new and more appropriate standards. The components identified during appraisal
were relevant and adequate, and crucial components, such as the reconstruction of housing, schools and
hospital facilities, were implemented ahead of time (73% of the total reconstruction works were
implemented during the first six month of project implementation).

Note: the schools reconstructed include 50 middle-school, 367 primary and 176 (self-built) primary schools
The hospitals reconstructed include 4 county-level hospitals and 22 villages and towns clinics
The income-generating components included restoration of damaged water supply to rural villages and their
expansion, when warranted; and irrigation schemes and provision of individual stone wells to farmers.
These schemes helped increase available water to very dry areas. This allowed switching crop patterns to
more lucrative production methods and substantially increased yields.
The works at the dam of the Friendship Reservoir Dam, a rock/earthfill type dam with a crest length of
about 280 meters and 40 meters high, was the single largest project component. There was some leakage
through the dam, and hence a rehabilitation program was undertaken for the damaged structures. The
program included spillway and spillway bridge repairs, core section and foundation grouting, impervious
membrane to protect leakage through the dam, and rehabilitation of the intake structure. In addition, a
comprehensive monitoring system using piezometers to measure water pressure in the dam as well as
settlement was installed. The rehabilitation program was successfully completed in 1999.
Institutional Development: Despite the fact that institutional development is not a key objective in an
emergency operation, the project's institutional development component can be considered satisfactory. The
- 5 -



main  achievement was the  introduction  of better construction  methods and  cost effective
earthquake-resilient measures. These new improved construction methods have been adopted for all future
housing and public building construction.  Substantial technical assistance was provided within the
allocated funds and training courses were delivered to about 2,300 people, on earthquake resistant
measures, new building standards, construction supervision, and project and financial management (see
below).

4.3 Net Present Value/Economic rate of return:
The estimation of the economic benefits is not applicable for the project as it was an emergency recovery
operation. The project had an important positive impact on beneficiaries deriving from both (a) the physical
components, due to the rapid and adequate reconstruction of assets providing basic needs to the local
population (shelter, water, medical facilities and schools), and (b) the income-generating component
-6 -



(inigation). The project is estimated to have directy benefited 440,000 people, or 63% of the resident
population in the four counties which were affected by the quake (See Annex 3 for more details).
4.4 Financial rate of return:
n.a.
4.5 Institutional development impact:
Although institutional development was not a key objective of this emergency operation, the project's
institutional impact can be considered substantial. There were clear benefits for the agencies in their
participation in the project, and staff involved in project implementation increased their capabilities through
on-the-job training, dealings with IDA and application of new procedures and training. Two main features
were introduced that contributed to capacity building of the local agencies and communities. These are: (a)
new design for houses and schools, containing significant improvements in the building characteristics and
standards (foundations, ring beams to hold walls together at the top, clay brick walls and more careful
bonding); and (b) a skill training and building standard dissemination campaign.
5. Major Factors Affecting Implementation and Outcome
S.1 Factors outside the control of government or implementing agency:
Major factors outside govemment or implement agency control are: (a) the severe cold and dry climate, and
(b) the dire poverty of the people in the area. The residents needed to be provided with shelter quickly, and
to remain in their villages, close to their land and only source of income (farmland agriculture). These
factors determined several of the choices that were made in the project design and imposed a very tight
reconstruction schedule. While rapid reconstruction was a desirable outcome, it also limited thorough
supervision of the application of the earthquake resilient measures in the whole area. Some construction
quality problems could have been avoided had reconstruction taken place less quickly.
5.2 Factors generally subject to government control:
One of the most positive factors in project success was the level of commitment of the Hebei Finance
Bureau, the Zhangjiakou Municipal Govemment, the Governors of the affected counties, and the dedication
of the project management office (PMO) director and his team and their willingness to ensure the success
of the project and outperform their own targets. Additionally, staff with a variety of expertise were
appointed at all level of govemment to contribute to the project. Sound arrangements were made for
coordination among the parties and for liaising with IDA. Counterpart funds were also adequate and timely.
5.3 Factors generally subject to implementing agency control:
The agency appointed to implement the project was the Zhangjiakou Finance Bureau and a dedicated PMO
was created to coordinate and supervise the project. While there are other projects in the Province, the
PMO benefited from the excellent guidance by the Hebei Finance Burea and its provincial project office.
The PMO was new to both the Bank and other donors activities and was inexperienced in Bank's
procedures and reporting. Despite this inexperience, the PMO was able to provide good supervision to the
counties offices resulting in achievement of the project objectives. This close coordination and continuous
dialogue had a positive impact on the project, as they helped in the rapid implementation of the project and
in taking corrective actions as soon as needed.

5.4 Costs andfinancing.
The total project costs were estimated at US$41.1 million and the proposed Credit amount was SDR 21.1
million (or $28.4 million equivalent). The average cost of the various project components remained very
similar to appraisal estimates. This was mainly due to the speed at which the project was implemented,
which implied that there were no price variations in material or labor. Also no major changes to the
project's scope were made. No extension was needed beyond the project closing date of December 31,
2000. Total accumulated expenses amounted to $40.6 million, equivalent to 95% of the total project
investment. Disbursements stand at SDR2 1.0 million (US$28.9 million) or 99.53% of the Credit amount.
Due to the fact that the project was implemented very quickly, there were only minimal changes in project
scope. The completion of the original project scope was achieved with a saving of $800,000 (due to a
favorable US$/SDR exchange rate) and the project office requested that these funds be utilized to repair
some 300 houses in Wanquan County, which were damaged (though not too seriously) in the earthquake.
Apparently the success of the introduction of the earthquake-resistant repair methods led the residents of
this County to request that similar repairs be carried out on their own houses.

Sustainability of the project is considered highly likely. The project components have been completed and
the objectives met. The long-term sustainability for an emergency operation, however, mainly depends on
(a) introducing practices that allow the relevant agencies to better organize relief and improve their
response to similar emergencies; and (b) reducing the likelihood of damage in the future through more
resilient construction methods. The project did not address the first issue as the response received to the
earthquake by the central government and local agencies was already quick and efficient. Related to the
latter, the project insisted that newly introduced local building codes be followed and appropriate
techniques for strengthening structures be utilized during reconstruction. Details and drawings on how
buildings had been reinforced, based on the improved standards have been provided by the PMO. New
construction standards were issued by the Zhangjiakou construction commission at the end of 1997,
requesting the adoption of earthquake-resistant construction methods. Apparently these building codes
were adopted for the reconstruction of all damaged buildings, not only for those financed through the
Credit.
The supervision missions were also able to verify that, at least for private dwellings, the residents realized
the advantage of using better construction methods for their houses. For example, even without considering
the improved living conditions offered by brick construction (as opposed to the previously used mud and
stone construction), even the significant price differential (Y6,000 for a room built under the new standards
versus Y2,500-3,000 for a new room using traditional construction method) did not entice local residents to
switch back to the old mud and stone construction methods.
Sustainability of the irrigation and poverty alleviation components is also likely. There was strong
competition among villagers to be the beneficiaries of this assistance. The criteria for selection of the
villages were, however, strict to ensure that the maximum benefits would be derived from the investments
and attention was given by the local irrigation and rural offices to avoid over-exploitation of the limited and
fragile water resources in the area. There is high demand for the product cultivated in the area and prices
are on the rise. Irrigated land also allows more flexibility in crop pattems and reduces the vulnerability of
farmers to climatic conditions and other shocks.

6.2 Transition arrangement to regular operations:
Reconstruction or rehabilitation included private housing and public buildings such as schools and a
hospital, which were immediately returned to the local agencies that were previously operating them. In
some cases, sustainability of services may have been impaired by lack of school and hospitals materials,
equipment and consumables. This is because the Borrower favored the utilization of the limited project
funds to address the most urgent issues (physical reconstruction) with the expectations that the rest of the
assistance would be provided over time by the local governments and by beneficiaries themselves.
However, the project was able to attract other donors to the area (AusAid). Also, efforts are underway to
attract Japanese assistance (through the Japanese Social Development Fund) for the provision of equipment
and consumables for schools and health clinics, increasing the likelihood of project sustainability.
7. Bank and Borrower Performance
Bank
7.1 Lending:
IDA's performance in identification is rated highly satisfactory. The Government requested IDA's
intervention immediately following the earthquake, and IDA was able to field an identification/preparation
mission from the Beijing Office within ten days of the quake. The team identified an emergency relief
operation that was fully consistent with both the CAS and with the borrower's priorities of restoring basic
infrastructure before the following winter. The team's skills included an engineer, a transport specialist, a
financial analyst and a procurement specialist. The team adequately addressed the inexperience of the
borrower by keeping the project's design and objectives simple. Simplified procurement procedures
allowed for national shopping and some force account instead of requiring works through NCB. These
simpler procedures did not overburden the borrower, and thus accelerated implementation. The only
safeguard policy applicable was for environmental assessment, where the project's reconstruction
investmnents made it a category "B" project.
IDA's performance in preparation and appraisal is also rated highly satisfactory. A combined preparation
and appraisal mission took place less than two months after the quake and was composed of eight staff
members, with an excellent skill mix (see annex 4). Of particular importance was that most of the team
members had extensive expenence from implementing previous earthquake emergency relief operations in
China. This experience allowed lessons learned from those operations to be incorporated into the design of
the Hebei Earthquake Rehabilitation Project. Appraisal recommendations were consistent with the needs
expressed by the client and did reflect the close participation of the beneficiaries in the project design.
Project costs were accurately appraised. Consistent with CAS objectives of poverty alleviations, some
income-generating components were also added to ensure that the livelihoods of the residents in these poor
counties could also be maintained. As stated above, lessons leamed were accurately reflected in the design
of this operation. One shortcoming was that performance indicators defined at appraisal mainly focused on
physical targets and on reconstruction indicators, while it would have been preferable to also include
indicators on the direct impact of the project on beneficiaries and quantification of the outcome in terms of
beneficiary satisfaction, etc.
7.2 Supervision:
IDA's performance in supervision is rated highly satisfactory. Due to the very short construction season
(only five months) only one supervision mission was scheduled per year, towards the end of the
construction season. This was considered the most effective timning. During winter and spring, IDA and the
borrower conducted extensive consultations to agree on the implementation schedule and targets for the
-9-



upcoming construction season. This collaborative approach was very effective. IDA supervision mission
members included staff with engineering, disbursement, procurement, and economic skills. Continuity in
the IDA team was maintained from preparation, through supervision to completion. This was important
considering the speed of implementation, the fragmentation of the project sites and components, and the
importance of meeting the targets for the project beneficiaries.
Each mission undertook field visits to the different counties and visited various project components
(hospitals, grain storage facilities, water conservation storages and irrigation, etc.). This was very helpful
to control progress of works as well as check on the quality of construction and construction materials.
Because of this close supervision, remedial actions could be taken for certain works which were not built
with appropriate materials or care. The technical advice provided to the PMO during these missions, was
well appreciated by the client and allowed better quality construction and supervision of future works.
Project progress was adequately reported.  Back-to-office reports were complete with thorough
aide-memoires and follow-up letters. Project status reports gave realistic and consistent performance
ratings throughout implementation. The project did not deviate from any IDA policies or procedures.
7.3 Overall Bankperformance:
IDA's performance is rated highly satisfactory. IDA was able to react promptly to the borrower's request,
adequately prepare and appraise the project, and arrange for Board approval in just over four months. It
maintained close supervision and continuous interaction with the client. It also helped catalyze additional
funding from bilateral donors to supplement parts of the projects or complementary activities.
Borrower
7.4 Preparation:
The Borrower's performance during project preparation is rated highly satisfactory. The Govemment
quickly recognized the extent of the damage following the earthquake and the importance of moving quickly
given the severity of the climate, and immediately called for IDA's assistance. Furthermore, the
Govemment was able to mobilize a large team of experts, officials and staff at all level of govemment who
participated in the definition of the project concept.
7.5 Government implementation performance:
The Government's implementation performance is rated highly satisfactory. Strategic choices made for the
reconstruction of the area, including the part covered by the project proved very effective. Counterpart
funds were adequate and timely. The implementation arrangements proposed by the local agencies were
very satisfactory. The provincial and city governments promptly established a leading group to give policy
guidance on earthquake emergency relief and reconstruction efforts; similar arrangements were made at the
county level. The Provincial PMO (that is in charge of overseeing other IDA projects in the province) was
assigned the task of facilitating communication with IDA and of advising the local implementing offices. A
city PMO was formed to be responsible for all key activities for project preparation and implementation
and to oversee and advise similar PMOs that were created at the county level and to support these, in the
areas where they had limited capabilities. Arrangements made during preparation were maintained and
reinforced during the implementation, thus providing continuity.
Zhangjiakou Municipal Government established a Project Management Office, reporting directly to the
Zhangjiakou Vice Mayor, staffed by employees from the various concemed government agencies. The
- 10 -



Provincial Government provided essential assistance on financial management, procurement and
disbursement through its provincial project office. The four counties and the 32 townships have set up
local project offices to manage and monitor the implementation of project, and the 217 village
representatives have been appointed to manage the construction in their respective areas. Some 300 persons
from county and township project offices have been trained by the Zhangjiakou Construction Commissions
on the approved earthquake resilient housing reconstruction methods. These persons have worked in the
villages to assist and monitor the implementation of the new construction standards.
The only area where Government supervision was inadequate was in the application of the financial
arrangements, particularly for the on-lending ternns and cost recovery arrangements. Indeed while certain
repayment terms had been agreed upon in the Development Credit Agreement (DCA), these were not
correctly reflected in the subsidiary agreements and the terms of the on-lending agreement were modified.
In particular, the repayment period was shortened. The on-lending terms agreed to under the Credit
required that the Credit proceeds be passed on from the City to the beneficiaries on the same terms and
conditions as these were received by the province (13 years of which 4 years of grace). However, these
were shortened without IDA's prior approval for the City of Zhangjiakou to the three Counties, to 10 years
of which 3 years of grace; and for the Counties Government to the Villages, to 7 years of which 2 years of
grace. The reasons for these changes were apparently due to a desire to reduce the risk of defaulting or
delayed repayment from the Counties and villages, which would expose the City to the burden of repayment
of the Credit. Subsidiary agreements have now been satisfactorily revised and amended to follow the DCA.
As no repayment of the Credit from the counties to the municipal and provincial governments has yet
started, this had no practical effect. Also the auditing of the project accounts showed that an informal
agreement seemed to be in place, whereby the City of Zhangjiakou intended to charge an interest rate of 2%
on the Credit proceeds, rather than the 0.75% service fee indicated in the DCA. This decision was also
corrected by the local government. As no repayment had been made and no interest has been charged, this
also had no effect. The PMO agreed that this was incorrect and has subsequently reversed this decision.
It should also be noted that, it took four months to declare the project effective, which earned the project a"
flag" for a long effectiveness delay (according to QAG standards, emergency reconstruction operations,
should take a maximum of three months to become effective). -This had no impact on the implementation of
this very successful project, as the Borrower had already begun reconstruction efforts under retro-active
financing arrangements long before the actual effectiveness date in order not to lose the 1998 construction
season.
7.6 Implementing Agency:
The performance of the implementing agency is rated highly satisfactory. The speed of project
implementation was impressive compared to the targets agreed at negotiations. The already ambitious
targets of reconstructing all housing in 1998 was achieved on schedule and reconstruction of other damaged
facilities (school, hospitals, etc.) was completed substantially ahead of schedule. Seventy percent of the
IDA Credit was spent during the first year of project implementation against a seemingly optimistic target
of 50%. These achievement were obtained due to the strong commitment of the PMO and the project
implementing units and their dedication to ensuring that the local population would have adequate shelter
and the necessary facilities before winter began.
The Implementing Agency focused its efforts mainly on achieving physical results and had a good system
for monitoring physical targets. However, the same cannot be said for the monitoring and evaluation of the
project's social and financial outcomes and its impact on the beneficiaries. Financial management and
- 11 -



project progress reporting were two areas were the PMO's performance was somewhat below standard.
The financial management system was relatively rudimentary, but despite IDA's insistence during
supervision missions, the PMO did not put into place adequate personmel and/or invest the necessary funds
to address these issues. The PMO could not establish the capabilities that would have ensured higher level
management of these two aspects. Report submissions were delayed, and the reports were not very
comprehensive; IDA requested clarifications often.  Reporting to IDA was also very simple and
rudimentary (including for the ICR, which IDA had suggested be prepared by consultants). The poor
reporting often necessitated multiple follow-ups from IDA to seek data and infonnation. While better
reporting would have reduced the burden of supervision for IDA, it did not have a negative affect on the
development outcome of the project. The benefits of the project and the close involvement of the
beneficiaries in implementation are self-evident, if rather poorly documented.
All physical targets set at appraisal were met or exceeded, and site visits by the supervision missions or by
the project office generally confirmed the satisfactory implementation of the construction works. When
quality of construction was identified as inadequate, remedial actions were quickly implemented. In cases
were dwellings had to be completely rebuilt, larger houses and of better quality than those destroyed by the
earthquake were provided and earthquake resistant measures introduced. All beneficiaries expressed
satisfaction with the new dwellings and increased living spaces. The quality control of some of the
construction works, especially in more remote areas, was found to be deficient in some cases. However,
the PMO was always keen to undertake quick remedial actions and improve performance in the remaining
works. In sum, while the implementing agency may have had limited capacity, it always showed strong
drive for results and focused its attention on achieving the project objectives.
7.7 Overall Borrower performance:
Based on the above the Borrower's performance is rated as highly satisfactory.  The Borrower's
commitment to the project's objectives remained strong during implementation. One of the most likely
risks was delay in implementation because the activities were small and widely dispersed in remote areas.
However, the Borrower minimized this risk by forming project offices at all level of governments. Several
of the components were implemented with great urgency and ahead of scheduled completion. The Borrower
was quick to address the potential risks of the project.
8. Lessons Learned
Key lessons learned from implementation of the project include:
*     Replicability: Lessons quoted in the appraisal documentation (need for strong local leadership,
attention to Borrower's view, fast tracking of project processing and minimization of cash flow
bottlenecks), were all taken into account in designing the project and developing the implementation
arrangements. The participation of staff who had extensive expertise in earthquake rehabilitation and who
were familiar with the local and country conditions should be taken into account while forming preparation
and supervision teams. At the same time some of the general suggestions/guidelines utilized in emergency
operations (for example that implementation period should be three years and possibly longer) were,
correctly, discarded by the project team in this specific case.
*     Attention given to project preparation and simplicity in design paid off: The project was very
well prepared so no changes in the project objectives and costs and only minor changes in the project
components resulted. One of its main features was simplicity of design, which avoided overburdening the
- 12 -



reconstruction effort with too many non-reconstruction components, conditionalities, studies and surveys.
The project scope was relevant and focused, and tried to avoid including too many or too sophisticated
components. The selection of the components centered around the life of the communities in the villages
and townships, i.e., the reconstruction of the basic services and support to their livelihood. This helped
make the project relevant to them and increased their commitment and responsiveness.
*     Procurement methods: Flexible procurement methods, such as force account to construct
small works in remote areas and national shopping for local materials and many small civil works, were
allowed in the DCA. This made it possible for the project to be carried out effectively and quickly. This is
an important lesson learned and could be extended to other emergency projects. The number of
conditionalities in the DCA was also kept to a minimum, which helped the client focus on achieving the
main development outcome.
*     Sustainability: A key element for sustainability is the introduction of seismic-resistant construction
methods, and training and dissemination of these practices. The type of design and construction methods
were also adequate to the local conditions and utilized appropriate reconstruction material and practices.
These solutions were locally generated, adapted and affordable, hence they quickly became popular among
the residents who demanded that these better practices be utilized in the construction of their dwellings.
*     Participation by beneficiaries: Close consultation was maintained with the beneficiaries for both
the reconstruction and poverty alleviation components. The implementation arrangements were designed in
such a way to ensure that the smallest village or community would be represented in the project or would
have a referent to go to with its demands. This greatly helped in the speed of implementation and increased
social acceptability.
*     Income generation: Economic rehabilitation can be considered an integral part of the
reconstruction process in extremely poor areas. The provision of new water supply and irrigation systems
helped reduce vulnerability of the local population and strengthened social and organizational capacity.
9. Partner Comments
(a) Borrower/implementing agency:
1. Comments:
By the efforts and close co-operation made by both World Bank and Borrower, the implementation of
Hebei earthquake rehabilitation project is very successful and the cooperation made by both parts is also
pleasure. After three years efforts, both of us have got great achievement on various sectors, so we
comment as follows:
a. Reflect fairly a pleasure co-operation between two parts during the period of the implementation
of the project and the efforts and the good perfornance made by both parts for the success of
project.
b. Objectively appraised various work and hard efforts made by borrower's govemment, PMO and
all the staffs involved in the project for the success of the project as well as the benefits from
both economic and social after the project.
c. Overall outline the conditions happened from the time of beginning of 1998, after the
earthquake World Bank send its teams for project identification, appraisal, to the end of 2000,
the project to be totally completed. Also valuable documentation have been provide for
borrower to conduct the other World Bank project in the future.
- 13-



d. Sincerity raised the problems, shortcoming of borrower existed during the implementation of the
project and it is good for the borrower to improve themselves in the future's World Bank
project and try their best to make all of the work to meet the requirement of World Bank as
well as create condition to co-operate with World Bank in the future.
2.    Suggestion for revise
As to 19 of the draft ICR, the actual remained money (US $ 0.60 million because of the change of the
exchange rate) to be used in Wanquan is not only to repair 300 rooms, the actual data is rebuild 480
rooms; and repair 1978 rooms.
3.    Suggestion:
a After the completion of the project, WB should also make further communication with borrower
to make understanding well and to provide funds or more information to seek other source of
fund to help the borrower to complete the remained work need to be done for the poor people
and enable WB project create more economic and social benefits.
b. Simplify as much as possible the application procedure to get WB loan and the formalities to
use the money.

Project Financing Plan. The Memorandum and Recommendation of the President did not include a
financing plan broken down by component. IDA's contribution was estimated at $28.4 million (of which
$3.7 million foreign) and the Government of China, Hebei Province and the beneficiaries together were to
finance the remaining $12.7 million (100% local). The total financing plan was for $41.1 million.

Annex 3. Economic Costs and Benefits
As this was an emergency recovery operation, the economic benefits were not estimated at appraisal.
However, the benefits are described below to the extent possible.
The project as a whole had a large positive impact on its beneficiaries. Benefits that were anticipated, but
not quantified at appraisal, include rapid restoration of social and economic activities through the
reconstruction efforts for about 430,000 people; and provision of water for irrigation to about 100,000
people in three counties (29 townships and 228 villages). At the end of the project, about 20,000 rooms in
private houses had been rebuilt or restored and greatly improved (in terms of construction materials and
available space); 593 schools had been rebuilt or improved and the risks of future destruction is reduced.
Two-hundred eighty-three hospital beds are again available as well as health facilities, which provide
essential, if basic, services to the population.
The project improved the lives of 63% of the population that was directly affected by the earthquake.
Indirect benefits have arisen to the entire one million population residing in the four project counties.

Note: some of the beneficiaries were involved in more than one component7
'Total not possible to avoid double-counting
Indirect benefits include the institutional development components and the training administered to the
ijmplementing agency, and its various ramification in the counties and villages. A wide target group in the
local community, including the local construction industry and residents, have been exposed to earthquake
resilient measures and technologies. This improves project sustainability and reduces the risk of future
destruction. The benefits from the irrigation components were substantial and were achieved in a short
period of time. The positive economic impact of the irrigation component can be attributed to the following
reasons: (a) a 17% expansion of the irrigated area in the three counties where irrigation schemes were
implemented (Zhangbei, Shangyi, and Kangbao); (b) changes in cropping patterns to include crops such as
vegetables (with a value of up to ten times the traditional crops), and increases in yields of up to four times
between the irrigated and rain-fed fields (for wheat for example); and (c) increased flexibility in crop

patterns and length of season of the yields (reducing exposure of the farmers to climatic variability).
For the irrigation sub-components an IRR was calculated at time of appraisal and estimated at 27%. At the
time of the ICR mission, insufficient data was available to calculate an EIRR, due in part to the fact that
some of the schemes had just entered operations and produce from irrigated land had yet to be harvested.
However, the IRR is anticipated to be in the order of magnitude of the appraisal estimate, if not higher.
This is due to the following factors: (i) there was only a marginal variation in the capital costs since the
time of appraisal; and (ii) based on the partial sample of fields crops that had been irrigated (the with
project scenario), it was noticed that yield was higher than anticipated at appraisal. Demand for the
produce was high and growing, hence anticipating a reliable and sustainable stream of revenues for the
farmers.
It is also worth noting that cost-effectiveness and poverty reduction objectives were considered during
project implementation. This is reflected in the selection criteria used to identify counties for
implementation of the water and irrigation schemes. As there was large demand to receive assistance for
increased water supply or irrigation, the counties introduced the following selection criteria. For a village
to qualify for assistance, it had to: (i) have had the majority of its water structure damaged by the
earthquake; (ii) have comparatively easy accessibility for supply of material and construction (to maintain
the tight implementation schedule); and (iii) demonstrated ability to handle the project. In the case of the
irrigation schemes, the selection criteria were the following: (i) available water resources, that could be
easily tapped without damaging the water table; (ii) easiness to cultivate the land (flat rather than hilly);
(iii) absence of any other irrigation scheme in the village; (iv) willingness of the village to participate in the
project and to accept repaymnent terms (both were ascertained through intensive consultation with the
village residents); and, most importantly; (v) average income level (the poorer the village, the higher the
chance it would be provided with an irrigation scheme). Priority in the selection was given to the poorest
villages.
