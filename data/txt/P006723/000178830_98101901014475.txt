SIXTH HIGHWAY PROJECT (LOAN 680-CO)
PROJECT COMPLETION REPORT
PREFACE
The following is a Project Completion Report on the Sixth Highway
Project in Colombia for which Loan 680-CO, in the amount of US$32.0 million,
was approved by the Board on May 12, 1970. The loan was closed on July 15,
1980, almost six years after the appraisal estimated closing date.
This Completion Report was prepared by the Bank's Latin America
and the Caribbean Regional Office and is based on information in the Bank's
appraisal and supervision reports, correspondence files, the loan document,
economic reports, transport sector surveys, MOPT's quarterly and final
reports, and information gathered by a completion report mission in May/June
1980.
In accordance with the revised procedures for project performance
audit reporting, this Completion Report was read by the Operations Evaluation
Department and the project was not proposed to be audited by OED staff. The
Draft Completion Report was sent to the Borrower; however, no comments were
received.

SIXTH HIGHWAY PROJECT (LOAN 680-CO)
PROJECT COMPLETION REPORT
HIGHLIGHTS
The Sixth Highway Project (Loan 680-CO) only partially achieved its
main objective of improving communications between the Atlantic ports in
Barranquilla, Cartagena and Santa Marta and the major commercial and industrial
centers of the country, since nearly half of the intended paving works were not
completed under the loan (para 7.01). On the other hand, construction of the
Barranquilla Bridge and completion of the Buga-Buenaventura highway were suc-
cessfully carried out under the project (para 6.01) and resulted in estimated
economic returns well above those expected at appraisal (paras 4.07 and 4.08).
From the beginning, implementation of the paving program suffered
from substantial time and cost overruns which resulted, first, in a reduction
of project scope (para 3.08) and, later, in several revisions of Bank partici-
pation (para 3.12).
The revised project was completed in late 1981, about eight years
after the original appraisal date. The PCR identifies the following reasons
for such poor project performance (para 3.05):
(a) financial difficulties of the Government causing tardiness in
payment of contractual advances;
(b) contractors' financial problems stemming from contracts based on
unrealistically low bids;
(c) contractors having insufficient equipment;
(d) inadequate design plans requiring MOPT to modify pavements and
alignments;
(e) lack of experience of some field supervision engineers;.
(f) heavy rains; and
(g) asphalt shortages.
The report concludes that, in retrospect, some of these problems
could have been avoided or greatly alleviated, and points out the items that
should have received more attention, but which are now usually considered
fully in highway projects (para 7.02):
(a) much more realistic assessment of the implementing agency's
competence and capacity and a time schedule which fully
recognizes local practices and conditions; and
(b) completed engineering work prior to loan negotiations to minimize
delays and cost increases caused by extensive physical changes
during construction.

I. INTRODUCTION
1.01      Colombia now has a road network of about 70,300 km, 22,700 of which
form the national highway system under the authority of the Ministry of Public
Works and Transport (MOPT) 1/. About 34,600 km come under the jurisdiction
of 25 departments; some 11,000 km are managed by the National Feeder Roads
Fund (FNCV) and the balance (2,000) are municipal, community or private roads
(Map, IBRD 15226 (PCR)). In the early 1950s, Colombia's largely regionally-
oriented transport system began to envolve into a national system. Growing
demands by the rest of the economy necessitated the development of transpor-
tation in a relatively short time. By the early 1960s, the basic skeletal
structure of the Western Trunk Road (Cartagena-Medellin-Cali-Pasto), the
Eastern Trunk Road (Santa Marta-Bucaramanga-Bogota-Neiva) and two main trans-
verse roads that connect the eastern and western trunk roads in the central
region were open to traffic but not fully upgraded nor paved.
1.02      The Bank has been closely associated with highway development in
Colombia since 1951. Prior to the Sixth Highway Project, the Bank Group made
five loans totaling US$104.0 million equivalent in 1951, 1953, 1956, 1961, 2/
and 1968. The projects financed initially helped to create the basic national
highway network, with the Sixth Highway Project helping to finance the Govern-
ment's program of paving primary and secondary highways. Following the Sixth
Highway Project, the Bank has financed a Seventh Highway Project (Loan 1471-CO
for US$90 million) to rehabilitate paved trunk roads and improve MOPT's
maintenance of the national highway system, and a Highway Sector Project
(Loan 2121-CO) which became effective September 22, 1982.
1.03      This completion report is based on information in the Bank's
appraisal and supervision reports, correspondence files, the Loan Document,
economic reports, transport sector survey, MOPT's quarterly and final reports,
and information gathered by a completion report mission in May/June 1980.
II. PROJECT PREPARATION, APPRAISAL AND NEGOTIATIONS
2.01      The Government's original proposal for a Sixth Highway Project
included only a major bridge and 9 km of highway reconstruction and improve-
ment. However, a 1968 transportation study drew attention to the high economic
return from paving gravel roads with significant traffic volumes, and, following
an identification mission in May 1969, a paving program of about 1,735 km
(later reduced to 1,618 km) of roads was added, becoming the major component
of the proposed project. Road sections were selected by consultants, under
contract with MOPT, where present and estimated future traffic justified

paving and to satisfy the objective of fully integrating the Colombian highway
network with major ports in the north and principal economic centers in the
center of the country. Costs for the entire project were initially estimated
at US$65 million, including a foreign cost component of US$29 million.
2.02      A Colombian/US consortium was contracted by MOPT to prepare preli-
minary technical and economic studies, bid documents, contracts, and analysis
of proposals. Orginally, MOPT intended that any design engineering required
for the paving program would be prepared during the construction phase.
However, a Bank preparation mission (July 1969) highlighted the merits of
detailed engineering, which was subsequently carried out for about 800 km of
the proposed program.
2.03      Economic feasibility studies for the major bridge and the paving
program were reviewed by the Bank in October 1969, and an appraisal mission
visited Colombia in November and December. After discussions with MOPT,
the paving program was reduced from 1,735 km to 1,618 km by deleting uneconomic
sections.
2.04      To encourage greater use of capable local consultants, the Bank
agreed to finance 50% of the total cost of consulting services. To better
control consultants' costs, the Bank recommended that contracts have fixed
terms and limits on the amount of reimbursable costs; this proposal was
accepted.
2.05      Negotiations were held in Washington, D.C. in late March and
early April 1970. The Loan was approved by the Board of Directors on May 12,
1970, signed on June 4, 1970, and became effective on March 29, 1971 after
a delay of seven months. The loan effectiveness date was postponed five times
because of differences of opinion between the Borrower and the Bank on the
choice of supervision consultants. The original project completion date was
January 31, 1974.
2.06      The agreed project consisted of:
(a)  Paving Program:   improvement and paving of 1,618 km of primary and
secondary highways;
(b)  Barranquilla Bridge:   construction of a 1,483 meter bridge and
approaches;
(c)  El Pailon-Buenaventura Road:   reconstruction, improvement and paving
of the remaining 9.5 km of the Buga-Buenaventura highway; and
(d)  Technical Assistance:   supervision of the above three components by
consultants.
2.07      The estimated costs (in December 1969 prices), as shown in the
appraisal report, were:

III. PROJECT IMPLEMENTATION AND COSTS
A.   Project Execution 1/
(i) Barranquilla Bridge
3.01      After international competitive bidding, a joint venture Italian/
Colombian firm was awarded the construction contract for the bridge in July 1970.
Work, which began in September 1970, was slowed in 1971 because of substantial
difficulties encountered with pier foundations. The bridge was finished in
March 1974, about 16 months later than the original contract time of 30 months.
Construction costs exceeded the appraisal estimate by 41%; supervision costs,
which were 100% greater than the appraisal estimate, were about 10% of the
construction cost (Table 3) due mainly to the extended construction period and
inflation. These time and cost overruns are not considered excessive, however,
in light of the complex design and construction requirements and the high
caliber of works performed.
1/   Cost comparisons are in Col$ unless specifically stated.



-4-
3.02      The Government did not carry out a study of varying toll rates on
bridge traffic, as required in Section 5.08 of the Loan Agreement. After
completion of the bridge, MOPT requested the Bank to reconsider what it felt
was then a politically untenable obligation which would have limited utility
because the only alternative mode of transport (the ferries) had been taken out
of service. In June 1975, the Bank informed MOPT that the study would no longer
be required. Tolls, however, have always been collected. 1/
(ii) El Pailon-Buenaventura Highway
3.03      The project included completion of the final 9.5 km of the Buga-
Buenaventura Highway (the other portion of this road was financed under the
Fifth Highway Project, Loan 550-CO). The construction contract was awarded
to a Colombian firm in October 1970, and work officially began in April 1971.
Project implementation, satisfactory in the beginning, fell behind schedule
in 1973 and 1974, mainly because of: (i) design changes; (ii) delays in
acquiring right-of-way; and   (iii) contractor financial and management problems.
The contract was terminated by mutual agreement in June 1974 without completion
of the road. The remaining works were done by force account but were not
financed by the Bank. As shown in Table 3, total construction costs exceeded
the appraisal estimate by 22%, while supervision costs ran 254% over the
appraised value, mainly because of the long construction period (three years)
and inflation.
3.04      Section 5.10 of the Loan Agreement required the Borrower to undertake
a cargo-handling study to improve turn-around time at the country's major ports,
especially Buenaventura.   The Borrower made repeated requests that the study be
financed out of unallocated loan funds or through Bank technical assistance. How-
ever, because of construction cost overruns and the fact that the cost of the study
was not part of the Loan Agreement, the Bank did not agree with the request. A
Colombian firm was selected, and the study began in March 1973. It was completed
in May 1974 and has proved useful to the Colombian Port Authority in improving
port operations.
(iii) Paving Program
Initiation (1970-1973)
3.05      Separate contracts were awarded for each group of roads in the
paving program (Table 1). Bidding and awards were carried out in two phases,
the first in mid-1970 and the second in late 1970/early 1971. A total of 46
firms were prequalified for the program prior to the first bidding phase.
Although 12 foreign firms were prequalified, none submitted bids, probably be-
cause of the small amounts involved, scattered location of works, and intense
competition expected from local contractors who were known to bid with very low
prices. Works on the various groups began about a month after signing of
contracts, and, from the outset, progress was unsatisfactory. In 1971 and 1972,
1/   In 1980, the toll rate was Col$ 10.00 (about US$0.22).



-5-
significant delays were encountered due to: (i) financial difficulties of the
Government causing tardiness in payment of contractual advances; (ii) contractors'
financial problems stemming from contracts based on unrealistically low bids;
(iii) contractors having insufficient equipment; (iv) inadequate design plans
requiring MOPT to modify pavements and alignments; (v) a lack of experience of
some field supervision engineers; (vi) heavy rains; and (vii) asphalt shortages.
In February 1972, after more than one year of work, less than 20% of the project
had been completed. 1/
3.06      In 1973, most contractors, including two of the largest firms, were
experiencing serious financial difficulties. MOPT attempted to improve matters
by: (i) changing the price escalation formula; (ii) providing additional
advances to contractors at a reduced rate of interest; and (iii) releasing the
5% retention money upon completion of road sections. Although these measures
were taken without prior consultation with the Bank, they were accepted after
the Borrower explained that they were considered necessary to prevent major
damage to the construction industry.
Redefinition (1974-1976)
3.07      In spite of MOPT efforts, the situation continued to worsen,
particularly for the two major firms, which were now close to bankruptcy.
According to Colombian law at the time, contracts could not be extended
beyond 150% of original contract value, including price adjustments. 2/
Consequently, in January 1974, MOPT canceled or reduced the scope of seven
of the 14 contract groups 3/, rearranged the work into 16 groups and awarded
contracts for five of these after international competitive bidding 4/.
Bidding at the time, unlike four years earlier, was in each case based on
detailed engineering. The cost estimates for these re-bid sections were far
above the original values (in nominal terms) at appraisal, and, therefore, a
comparison of actual to appraised value should be viewed in light of infla-
tion and the necessity of improving designs (Tables 2B and 4).
3.08      Because of the substantial cost increases already encountered and
expected, the Bank proposed, in March 1974, to decrease its participation in the
paving program (at that time the only unfinished project component) from 50%
to 15%. MOPT contended that sufficient local funds were not available to
complement this low percentage and requested reduction of the project scope.
Agreement was reached on the exclusion of about 716 km of roads -- the criteria
for elimination being that contracts had not been awarded and work was not
underway. Two of the roads which remained in the program had a newly estimated
rate of return of less than 10% using cost/benefit streams beginning in 1976.
However, new estimates yielded a weighted average ERR of 23.7% for the 902 km
of highways remaining in the project, compared to a weighted average estimate
of 18.2% for the original project. This increase was largely attributed to
substantial growth in traffic on almost all roads compared to appraisal
projections.
1/   Disbursements under the loan at this time indicated greater progress
because of'MOPT advance payments to contractors.
2/   Decree-Law 150 of 1976 amended the 150% ceiling to apply to
contract unit prices exclusive of price adjustments.
3/   Group 9 had been divided into groups 9A and 9B.
4/   Bidding on the others pended a decision on reduction of the project.



-6-
3.09      By February 1975, four of the original 14 groups were complete and six
were nearly complete, totaling 568 km of paved roads. The final cost of roads
accepted by MOPT at this point exceeded the aggregate of original contracts by
some 60%. Because of non-compliance with contractual provisions, the original
contracts for the four remaining groups (4, 5, 7, and 11) were terminated by
MOPT before all road sections were completed. Certain other road sections
were deleted from Bank financing for unauthorized changes in the design
standards set out in Schedule 5 of the Loan Agreement. In December 1975, the
Board approved an amendment to the Loan Agreement reducing the Bank-financed
paving program by 716 km to 902 km, and the estimated cost to complete the
program at that time allowed the disbursement percentage to return to 50%.
Several of the deleted roads were completed by MOPT force account, and others
were partly financed by the Inter-American Development Bank.
3.10      Project paving work continued at a very slow pace.    By mid-1976, only
27 km had been completed in the preceding year, and the cost to completion was
estimated to be 50% higher than in mid-1975. MOPT attributed this dramatic
increase to oil-price inflation, to which the price of asphalt was particularly
sensitive (Colombia became a net importer of oil in 1976). Because of the
continuing cost increase, Bank disbursement was officially lowered to 30% in
January 1977. The lack of progress was due primarily to a shortage of funds
in MOPT; contractors had insufficient liquidity to carry out works on their
own (para 3.23). Furthermore, the program was slowed by the need to stop work
while letting new contracts for remaining road sections in five groups which
had reached 150% of their value (para 3.07). In addition, legalizing the new
contracts was more complicated than in the past because Colombia's new contract
law (Decree-Law 150 issued in January 1976) had more stringent provisions,
especially regarding allocation of specific budgets.
Completion (1977-1981)
3.11      Minimal progress on the paving program continued through 1977 and
1978. Less than 20 km of roads were paved in these two years, and, in November
1978, 192 km (22% of the project) still had to be completed. In 1978 and 1979
two contracts reached 150% of the original contract value and work was stopped.
The uncompleted portions, totaling 48 km, were deleted from the Bank-financed
project but retained in the paving program. One road (about 10 km) was completed
by the Department of Antioquia which contracted the work; the remaining 38 km
of the second road is scheduled for completion in 1983.
3.12      In April 1978, a supervision mission found that about Col$ 200 million
of payment certificates, some dating back to early 1976, had not been processed
by MOPT for Bank reimbursement. With the disbursement percentage at 30%, these
outstanding payments amounted to about US$1.6 million of the loan, leaving only
US$2.3 million in the account. This eventually necessitated reduction of the
disbursement percentage to 20% in July 1979, when costs to complete the project
were estimated at about US$16 million.
3.13      The last three road sections totaling 102 km were    completed by the
end of 1981, about seven years later than forecast at appraisal. The main
reasons for the extremely slow rate of work are summarized in paragraph 3.10.
Although the paving program was officially reduced to 902 km in 1976 (para 3.09),



- 7 -
the project covered only 864 km since several of the groups were slightly
shorter than the appraisal length, with only two groups exceeding the esti-
mated kms. 1/
3.14      On the whole, standards of pavement construction are acceptable,
except for some local pavement failures in group 5, 6 and 10; repairs were
made as needed. The failures were due primarily to poor drainage and poor
quality materials, the latter indicating somewhat inadequate supervision.

3.16      The Loan was fully disbursed on July 15, 1980, at which date 88% of the
864 km had been fully paved. Total construction costs in Col$ will exceed the
appraisal estimate by about 240%, and supervision costs will run about 480%
over appraisal figures. Supervision as a percentage of the construction costs
of the original groups was about 17%, and about 14% of the revised contract
groups (Table 2A and 2B). These figures are high but understandable consider-
ing the lengthy construction period and inflation. In current US$, the original
contract groups (carried out between 1970 and 1977) ranged from US$30,240 to
US$145,931 per km, with an average weighted cost of US$59,860 per km. The
revised contract groups (1974-1981), ranging from US$86,579 to US$195,619 per
km, had an average weighted cost of US$135,335 per km. For the works carried
out, these costs appear reasonable.
C.   Real Costs
3.17      Comparing the final real cost 1/ of the paving program (in 1970 pesos)
to the appraisal estimate indicates a real cost overrun of 102%. The appraisal
allowance for construction and supervision was Col$ 461.1 million (about US$25.1
million), and the final cost in constant 1970 pesos was Col$ 932.9 million (about
US$50.8 million). The weighted final real cost per km will be about Col$ 1.1
million (US$59,000). The cost overrun stemmed from several factors. Many
contractors bid and were awarded contracts well beyond their capacity, necessi-
tating termination and rebidding with attendant delays and cost increases.
Another cause was that design works were only partially and, in some cases,
poorly done during project preparation, which necessitated redoing during
implementation. Furthermore, some additional work was required during the
lengthy implementation of the paving program, e.g., base and sub-base works
carried out were eroded with use and rains, requiring extensive repair before
paving could be completed. These problems also partly stemmed from inadequate
supervision of works.
3.18      The same analysis for the Barranquilla Bridge yields an actual real
cost slightly lower than the appraised value (Col$ 175.5 million compared to
Col$ 202.8 million).   The final real cost for this 1,483-meter bridge was
Col$ 190,000/m (US$7,450/m). 2/   The El Pailon-Buenaventura Highway had a final
real cost of Col$ 45.9 million, which is also slightly lower than the appraisal
estimate of Col$ 48.7 million. 3/ The final real cost for this road was
Col$ 4.8 million/km (US$260,000/kim).
3.19      The average annual inflation for the period 1970-1980, whether using
the Construction Price Deflation Index or the Consumer Price Index, ran around
23%, accounting for the sizable nominal cost overruns (Tables 2A, 2B and 3).
The appraisal allowed only 7-1/2% annual price escalation in dollar terms, with
project completion expected by 1974. The extremely long implementation period
required and the intervening hikes in prices of petroleum products could not
have been foreseen at appraisal.
1/   Using the Deflation Index of Table 4, the appraisal estimate is brought
to 1970 pesos (the year in which works began).
2/   Using MOPT's Index 2A, covering reinforced concrete bridges, 1971 base

D.   Disbursements

E.   Highway Construction Industry
3.23      Of major importance in the lengthy implementation and high costs of
the Sixth Highway Project were the many serious problems encountered by con-
tractors. In an effort to secure contracts during a general lull in construc-
tion work in the early 1970s, bids submitted were, in most cases, unrealistic-
ally low. Contractors claimed that this problem stemmed from low MOPT unit
price estimates, although contractors were responsible for calculating their own
bids. The basic problem of too low bids was compounded by MOPT's late payment
of advances and interim certificates throughout project implementation, except
at the end of the project in 1979 and 1980. This placed a severe hardship on
contractors who had few liquid assets. Although contractors could borrow
against payment certificates at 3.6% monthly interest, there was not much
incentive to do so. Another financial handicap for contractors was the fact
that production was paid for at rates applicable when works were completed,
which did not compensate contractors for losses due to inflation during the
many months before payments were received. At Bank insistence, this situation
was corrected for contracts after 1976, including all those under the subsequent
Seventh Highway Project.
3.24      Although work schedules were drawn up when the contracts were made,
they were not seriously followed. MOPT was lenient in granting time extensions
and, in the early years, often renegotiated unit price. MOPT also granted
additional advances (in some cases more than 40% of contract value) and changed
some contract stipulations (para. 3.06) in order to assist firms facing
bankruptcy. In addition, all contractors were handicapped by insufficient or
old equipment, a problem which was exacerbated by the geographic dispersion of
road sections.
3.25      The thoroughness of the original contractor prequalification is
questionable. MOPT did not then have standard procedures, and financially weak
and inexperienced firms were prequalified. A new contract law (Decree-Law 150,
January 1976,) required MOPT to register contractors and set out improved
contracting procedures. Since then, there have been few cases of contract

replacing the original rate of 50%.

failures, but the number of restrictions and controls which the law introduced
caused a series of canceled tenders and delayed start-up of road works in
1977 and 1978. The law is presently under review to remove unnecessary
impediments to sound contracting.
3.26      As a result of the difficulties experienced by contractors, caused
in part by outdated plant and equipment and illiquidity, the Bank has
initiated a review of the contracting industry in Colombia. Measures to
improve contractors' operations and to update their equipment fleet are
included in MOPT's program. Moreover, contractors' financial difficulties,
which are aggravated by inability to secure financing from private banks, are
under review, and establishment of a specialized financial institution to
deal with this problem is being considered.
F.   Construction Supervision
3.27      Construction supervision was carried out by private consultants with
overall monitoring and coordination by MOPT, based on terms of reference
introduced in 1966. All consultants awarded contracts were Colombian except
one, which was a Colombian firm working with a US firm. Supervision of the
Barranquilla Bridge and the El Pailon-Buenaventura Highway was satisfactory,
but Bank missions found that the experience of consultants' site staff for
the Paving Program was often inadequate. Also, too many site decisions were
left to the head office, causing delays in work progress.
3.28      The original intention that the consultants who prepared the
paving program would act as overall supervisors in conjunction with MOPT was
abandoned with the change of Government in 1970. The Bank warned of the
possible problems in assigning responsibilities when separating engineering
and supervision, but, after lengthy discussion, concurred with Government's
decision. The 1976 Decree-Law 150 specifically states that design consultants
cannot carry out supervision of the project.
3.29      The cost of construction and supervision by consultants was well
above normal for most contracts (Tables 2A and 2B). As previously mentioned,
this was partly due to unexpectedly long construction periods and inflation.
Also contributing significantly to the cost overruns was the need for consul-
tants to recommend and design major modifications during construction because
of incomplete engineering as well as MOPT's practice of keeping consultants'
contracts in force during periods of no construction work when contractors were
changed or when new prices and contract conditions were negotiated.
3.30      MOPT coordination of construction supervision, which was affected
by three changes of administration, was not entirely satisfactory. In
mid-1970, a Coordination Unit, largely staffed with MOPT engineers, was
established, but was not effective in obtaining proper supervision, particularly
for technical matters related to the paving program. From late-1972 through
1974, local consultants were retained to strengthen the Coordination Unit,
and, for a while, improved operations were apparent. However, MOPT terminated
the consultants at the end of 1974 and, in early 1975, formed a new Supervi-
sion Division with primary functions of monitoring contracts and approving



- 12 -
payment certificates. The new division effected improvements in the admin-
istrative aspects of supervision, but did little to overcome the continuing
technical problems. Also, in 1975, a Special Highway Program Division was
formed in MOPT to coordinate projects financed by international agencies.
This division has undergone various changes over the years and was recreated
as the Foreign Credit Coordination Office by MOPT's Resolution 9681 of
November 3, 1982.
IV. ECONOMIC REEVALUATION
A.   Appraisal Evaluation
4.01      The projects included in the appraisal of the Sixth Highway Project
were expected to reduce transport costs by lowering vehicle operating and
time costs, shortening travel distances and eliminating serious bottlenecks.
in Barranquilla and Buenaventura. An economic rate of return (ERR) was estimated
for each of the road sections in-the paving program, the Barranquilla Bridge
and the El Pailon-Buenaventura highway (Table 7).
4.02      For the paving program, ERR estimates ranged between 10 and 25%,
compared to the opportunity cost of capital in Colombia, which, at the time,
was estimated at 10%. On most roads, because improvements consisted basically
of only paving with little geometric improvement, the economic life was
assumed to be 10 years. Some roads, which had sufficient traffic levels to
justify major improvements, were designed for a 20-year life. The Barranquilla
Bridge, which replaced the service of three ferries on the Magdalena River,
had an estimated ERR of 17.9 over a 20-year design life. The bridge was
expected to generate substantial additional traffic, nearly tripling the 1969
average daily traffic (ADT) by 1974 (from 1,000 vehicles to 2,916), and rising
to about 4,500 by 1979. An ERR of 11.8% was estimated for the El Pailon-Buena-
ventura Highway assuming a 6% p.a. traffic increase from 2,000 vehicles per
day in 1970 to 2,520 vehicles per day in 1974 at El Pailon and from 4,000 to
5,050 vehicles per day near the port. Appraisal estimates of traffic on all
project elements are shown in Table 5.
B.   Reevaluation
Paving Program
4.03      The reestimated ERRs for the completed road groups range from -5.8%
to 48.7%, with a weighted average of 20.1 for the entire program compared to a
weighted average of 18.2% at appraisal (Table 7). The mean ERR for the com-
pleted paving groups is 19.2% with a standard deviation of 11.8%; therefore,
by definition, 68% of the group ERRs are between 7.4% and 31%. Actually, only
3 of the 19 were below 10%; these were for the original group 13 (Punta de
Hierro-Magangue), group 14 (Neira-Aranzazu) and group 18 (San Onofre-Sincerin) 1/
which experienced minimal or negative growth in traffic (Table 5) and extremely
large cost overruns.
1/   When San Onofre-Sincerin is completed, the road is likely to have a higher
rate of return due to diverted traffic between Cartagena and Medellin.



- 13 -
4.04      In spite of the exceptional cost overruns on most roads, the final
ERRs are satisfactory when compared to the opportunity cost of capital in
Colombia, partly because of the large growth in ADT (Table 5). Appraisal
estimates of 1970 ADT for roads retained in the project showed a weighted
average of 471 vehicles for the paving program. This was expected to increase
to 775 by 1979, assuming an average annual 7% growth rate. However, the actual
figures for 1979 show a weighted ADT of 1,026, indicating a 13% average annual
traffic increase on roads included in the paving program.
4.05      ERRs were recalculated based on weighted average traffic and percent-
ages of light and heavy vehicles for each group. Benefits, calculated over
the same economic life assumed in the appraisal, are largely attributed to
the net differences between vehicle operating costs (VOC) on the newly paved
surfaces compared to the previous gravel surfaces.    VOC savings for light and
heavy vehicles are given in Table 6, based on MOPT 1978 data. Where road groups
contain roads of different grades, VOC savings were computed through weighting
by length. Time and maintenance costs savings were not included in the analy-
sis because they were not included in the appraisal estimates and, presumably',
would not be significant in the calculation of the overall benefits resulting
from paving.
4.06      All costs and benefits were brought to 1978 constant dollars using
the Deflation Index of Table 4 (transformed so that 1978 = 1.00). The Index
is a weighted composite of MOPT's Highway Construction Costs Indices I and IV.
Index I, which covers earthworks, sub-base and base, accounts for 80% of the
composite index, and Index IV, covering asphalt, accounts for 20%. These
assumptions are based on a study done by MOPT's Supervisory Group in November
1974, upon completion of 15 road sections, which indicated that approximately
17% of the total costs of roads stemmed from paving and the remainder from
factors included under Index I.
Barranquilla Bridge
4.07      Recalculation of the ERRs for both the Barranquilla Bridge and El
Pailon-Buenaventura Highway was undertaken by MOPT's Special Highway Programs
Division 1/. For the Barranquilla Bridge, the project benefits considered were
time cost savings for both drivers and passengers, the net difference between
1978 vehicle operating costs with ferry transport and bridge traffic and main-
tenance cost savings. The period of analysis utilized was 20 years following
the completion of works. ADT, measured at 3,412 in 1979, was assumed to grow
at 7% until 1981, 6% between 1982 and 1984, 5% until 1986 and 4% in the years
between 1987 and 1993. All costs and benefits were brought to 1978 constant
pesos, arriving at an ERR of 26% (compared t'o the appraisal estimate of 17%),
well above the opportunity cost of capital. Assuming time cost savings of
half the value used by MOPT 2/ yields an ERR of 13%,still'above the opportunity
cost of capital.

El Pailon-Buenaventura Highway
4.08      The El Pailon-Buenaventura Highway, analyzed with a 20-year economic
life, considered 1978 vehicle operating cost savings for light and heavy
vehicles and maintenance cost savings as the principal benefits. ADT measured
at 3,665 in 1979 was estimated to grow at an average annual rate of 6% until
1986 and then increase by 4% annually until 1993. All costs and benefits were
brought to 1978 pesos, arriving at an estimated ERR of 20% (compared to the
appraisal estimate of 12%), also well above the opportunity cost of capital.
V. INSTITUTIONAL PERFORMANCE AND DEVELOPMENT
5.01      Even before implementation of the Sixth Highway Project, MOPT suffered
numerous institutional and administrative weaknesses, impeding the achievement
of its objectives in the transport sector. The Bank, recognizing the severe
deficiencies of MOPT's procedures and system, had made reorganization of the
Ministry a covenant of the Fifth Highway Project Loan.    However, at the time the
Sixth Highway Project Loan was negotiated, the reorganization had not taken place
since the Consultants (Mexico/US joint venture) were still preparing their recom-
mendations. Therefore, the Loan Agreement for this project contained a similar
covenant (Section 5.09).
5.02      MOPT was restructured in January 1976, with a    redefinition of the
objectives and functions of many MOPT directorates and divisions as well as
some other agencies involved in transport planning. Despite that reorganiza-
tion, there was minimum progress in overcoming MOPT's management deficiencies
and problems, which have been described previously in paragraphs 3.12 and 3.23
through 3.30. It was not until 1979, when, after a change in Government,
improvements became apparent. It was too late for these improvements to
have any appreciable effect on completion of this project, but they resulted
in significant improvement in implementation of the Seventh Highway Project,
which had suffered serious delays in the first two years.
VI. ROLE OF THE BANK
6.01      The Barranquilla Bridge and completion of the Buga-Buenaventura
Highway were well chosen project elements, and no major problems were encountered
in their execution. However, the scope of the paving program proved to be some-
what beyond the management capabilities of MOPT at the time of implementation,
and the time schedules established for execution of all civil works proved to
be quite unrealistic. Although improvements in MOPT's organization and
operations were made part of the project, the time needed to agree and to make
such changes effective apparently was not recognized in evaluating MOPT's
ability to implement effectively a paving program of that magnitude. In
addition, the capacity and competence of the local construction industry and
the restrictive.terms and conditions under which they were required to operate
seem not to have been considered fully. The Bank's failure to require completed



- 15 -
design engineering prior to loan negotiations, as per current practice,
contributed to the cost and time overruns and the construction problems
encountered in the paving work.
6.02      The Bank provided generally adequate supervision during implementation
with an average of three missions per year. In 1973, when the project experi-
enced significant problems, six supervision missions visited Colombia. The
Bank displayed understanding and flexibility in agreeing to changes in project
scope and time extensions required to meet unexpected problems and delays.
Bank efforts to expand the use of local consultants and to improve administra-
tion of construction contracts have resulted in better performance by the
construction industry under the Seventh Highway Project.
VII. CONCLUSIONS
7.01      The project successfully met the objectives of improving vehicle
access to the port of Buenaventura by completing the Buga-Buenaventura Highway
and of facilitating transport across the Magdalena River via the Barranquilla
Bridge. However, the main objective of the paving program to improve communica-
tions between the Atlantic ports of Barranquilla, Cartagena and Santa Marta
and the major commercial and industrial centers of the country was not fully
achieved since nearly half of the intended paving works were not completed under
the loan 1/. Nevertheless, the bridge and the roads built with Bank assistance
are benefiting the Colombian economy by reducing vehicle operating costs on
important commercial and import-export routes, and, with a few exceptions, are
yielding high economic returns to the country.
7.02      Implementation of this project highlights three major items that
should have received more attention, but which are now usually considered fully
in highway projects. These are:
(a)   much more realistic assessment of the implementing agency's com-
petence and capacity and a time schedule which fully recognizes
local practices and conditions;
(b)   completed engineering work prior to loan negotiations to minimize
the delays and cost increases caused by extensive physical changes
during construction; and
(c)   recognition of the extreme importance of road maintenance and
inclusion of project provisions for needed improvements.
1/   However, several roads excluded from the Bank-financed Program were
financed by the Inter-American Development Bank; other works were completed
with MOPT funding.

a/ Weighted average rates of return for groups have been calculated from appraisal
individual road estimates, because contracts were awarded (and cost information
maintained) for road groups. Also, appraisal rate of return estimates are
adjusted to reflect final projects executed. (See Table 1). All rates of re-
turn assume 10-year life except where specified.
b/ Rate of return over 20-year life.
c/ Group completely cancelled.
d/ Rate of return over 15-year life.
