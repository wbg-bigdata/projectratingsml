                         Implementation Status Overview
                         This ISR update reflects the findings of a supervision mission undertaken between May 23 and June 9, 2011. Mission objectives included : (i) undertaking an assessment of project
                         implementation status; (ii) reviewing the strategic objectives of the project and its alignment with the Government's strategic development objectives and priorities ; (iii) proposing a
                         project realignment and strengthening as appropriate, until its closing date (September 2012).

                         While some PDO-level indicators have shown significant progress (e.g. with regard to the simplification of business start-up procedures, teledensity, access to finance), overall project
                         implementation is not satisfactory given the low execution rate (34% as of May 2011), procurement delays across components, and the failure to launch strategic activities (e.g.
                         industrial zones, matching grant fund) with only 15 months ahead of project close.

                         Despite the unsatisfactory progress with the PAC, the mission confirmed the strategic relevance of private sector development within Mali's accelerated growth and economic
                         transformation agenda. Strategic priorities in this area include: focus on economic diversification (particularly on mining and exports, agribusiness), financial services development
                         and SME support, as well as investment climate and investment promotion.

                         Key Decisions Regarding Implementation
                         (i) The recent IDA supervision mission recommends that the project be restructured so as to refocus its components on achievable activities, strengthen the project implementation
                         and results framework until project close, and build the foundations for a new engagement with regard to the private sector development and growth agenda moving forward.
                         (ii) The restructuring process is expected to free-up funding that can be allocated to other operations in Mali
