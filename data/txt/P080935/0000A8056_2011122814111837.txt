                         Implementation Status Overview
                         This ISR update reflects the findings of a supervision mission undertaken between September 14-17 and November 14-18, 2011. Mission objectives included: (i) review progress in
                         the implementation of the priority action plan and in project closing arrangements (ii) identify with Government possible mechanisms to support strategic reforms following the closing
                         of the project (iii) agree on arrangements related to the preparation of the follow up growth and competitiveness operation.

                         The project continues to show significant impact on some indicators (e.g. with regard to the simplification of business procedures, enterprise creation, teledensity, etc.), but its
                         implementation continues to be unsatisfactory given the low execution rate and the failure to launch strategic activities (e.g. industrial zones, matching grant fund, etc.). Project
                         disbursement is at 44.6% as of November 28, 2011.

                         Despite the unsatisfactory progress with the PAC, the Government confirmed the strategic relevance of private sector development within Mali's accelerated growth and economic
                         transformation agenda and requested that a follow up growth and competitiveness operation be identified.
