                         Implementation Status Overview
                         The Government of Mali and the World Bank agreed to anticipate project closing to end-March 2012. However as of March 22nd, the military staged a coup d'etat and suspended
                         Government institutions---the project closing process will likely be affected by the evolving political situation.

                         Below is an update on project implementation and next steps regarding project closing.

                         The Mali Growth Support Project (PAC)---$55m--was approved in 2005. The project was conceived by both GoM and the WB as one of the main instruments to support private-
                         sector led accelerated growth and economic transformation agenda. Strategic priorities in this area included: focusing on economic diversification (particularly on mining and exports,
                         agribusiness), financial services development and SME support, as well as investment climate and investment promotion. In this respect, the project supported the following
                         components: (i) improving the investment climate, with a particular focus on SMEs and on key sectors; (ii) expanding the availability of the infrastructure base for private sector
                         development (Airport, Industrial Zones, Mining, Telecom, Tourism, Handicrafts); and (iii) promoting business innovation through financial and non-financial services.

                         During the first three years, project implementation lagged due to a combination of factors, including weaknesses in project management unit, lack of monitoring and evaluation
                         framework, government reorganization, cabinet changes and 2007 presidential election period, lack of continuity with regard to WB team composition. The project also suffered from
                         being overly complex in terms of its articulation and institutional design, and overlap with other donor-funded programs (notably the MCC) regarding some key activities (e.g. airport).

                         An effort to address these issues was undertaken in 2009 when the project was restructured. The PDO redefined as "create conditions for increased private investment through
                         investment climate reforms, improved financial services and provision of non-financial services to private enterprises", components were revised (some activities were discontinued
                         for example with regard to the Bamako airport), an M/E framework was introduced, and project coordination was strengthened. Since project restructuring, some PDO-level
                         indicators have shown some significant progress (notably regarding the simplification of business start-up procedures, telecom sector reform, and access to finance by SMEs).
                         However, overall project implementation has not been satisfactory, with significant components and activities not executed at the end of the project (industrial zones, matching grant).
                         The project execution rate as of May 2011 reached 34%, and only 11.9% of its expected budget was executed in 2010. In June 2011 a prioritized action plan of activities was
                         identified together with the Government and the PIU. A decision to anticipate project closing to March 2012 agreed to in the fall 2012. Project activities significantly picked up since
                         2011/2012, with doubling of budget execution in 2011 and overall disbursements of around 45%.

                         Despite the unsatisfactory progress with the PAC, the Government confirmed the strategic relevance of private sector development within Mali's accelerated growth and economic
                         transformation agenda and requested that a follow up growth and competitiveness operation be identified. The ICR of the Growth Support Project is expected to provide significant
                         lessons which will help in the design of the new operation. The Government needs to submit a letter requesting the Bank with the exact amount of project funds that will be cancelled
                         and reallocated.
