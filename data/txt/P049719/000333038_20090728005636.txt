                1. PROJECT CONTEXT, DEVELOPMENT OBJECTIVES AND DESIGN

1.1 Context at Appraisal

The Kyrgyz Republic suffered through a period of economic contraction following attainment of
independence in the early 1990's. While the Government was committed to transition to a
market-based economy, the country lacked both the legal and institutional basis for this to be
readily achieved. Immovable property, representing the major share of the capital assets of the
country, figured as a key element of the economic reform strategy. However, there were
multiple agencies involved in maintaining data on immovable property, with no coordination
among them. While private property rights had been legally recognized for land and buildings in
preceding legislative reform, there was no legal or institutional basis for registering or protecting
those rights in an efficient and unambiguous manner, nor was there a supporting policy basis for
the development of immovable property markets. The lack of inter-agency coordination also
hindered Government efforts to properly administer land and real estate.

The strategic objectives of the Country Assistance Strategy (CAS) at the time were to: (i) attain
sustained economic growth, particularly through focus on agricultural growth; (ii) reduce
poverty; (iii) improve governance; and (iv) strengthen public finances. At the time of appraisal,
the Project was seen as a potential direct contributor to achieving the first and fourth objectives,
and as indirectly addressing the second and third. The Bank coordinated with other donors
leading up to appraisal. USAID had conducted a small pilot project testing techniques for the
collection of data necessary for systematic property registration and had taken a lead role in
drafting a Land Registration Law. The Bank assisted in preparing that draft and took a lead role
in discussions with Government concerning institutional arrangements for a land and real estate
registration system. The Bank had become increasingly involved with registration and cadastre
operations in many countries, and specifically elsewhere in the Commonwealth of Independent
States (CIS), and was recognized by Government as being uniquely qualified to assist in
establishment of the Kyrgyz land and real estate registration system.

1.2 Original Project Development Objectives (PDO) and Key Indicators (as approved)

The Project Development Objective (PDO) was to support development of markets for land and
real estate and the more intensive and effective use of land and real estate through the
introduction of a reliable and well-functioning system for registration of rights in immovable
property. It was understood that key indicators for this objective would be increased level of
activity in sales and mortgage markets. However, the Project Appraisal Document (PAD) did
not specify quantified indicators for these. The PAD did specify achievement of high service
standards for the registration system (3 days to register for secondary transactions) that would
move the Kyrgyz Republic ahead of many developed market economies to the top rank
internationally for this measure. The PAD also contained a key output indicator of 600,000
properties (of a total of 2.5 million properties nationwide) to be covered by systematic
registration.

1.3 Revised PDO (as approved by original approving authority) and Key Indicators, and
reasons/justification N/A

1.4 Main Beneficiaries

The target population identified in the PAD was those who hold rights in land and real estate or
who would like to acquire such rights. Other identified beneficiaries were those wanting to make
use of the information base to be developed by the Project. Among this broad set of
beneficiaries, it is worth noting a number of subsets with more specific potential gains from the
Project. This would include: (i) the poor, who would gain Government protection of their rights
and avoid the costs associated with initial registration thanks to the program of systematic
registration; (ii) professionals involved in real estate markets, such as real estate agents and
banks; (iii) those interested in utilizing their property as collateral for loans; and (iv) municipal
and higher levels of government in need of a unified information base on immovable property.

1.5 Original Components

The Project was composed of three components: (a) institutional development, (b) operational
services, and (c) training.

(a) Institutional Development ­ The primary purpose of this component was to get the national
land and real estate registration system established and running smoothly and to address
improvements in the procedures associated with transactions. The component also included
operation of the Project Implementation Unit within the State Agency for Registration of Rights
in Immovable Property (Gosregister). The specific activities enumerated in the PAD were to:

    ·   establish management capacity at national level to supervise, monitor and promote the
        registration system nationwide, to encourage development of the land and real estate
        market, and to monitor and evaluate project progress;
    ·   set up registration offices throughout the country and implement sporadic (on demand)
        registration in each office;
    ·   provide a full legislative, regulatory and procedural framework for operation of the
        registration offices;
    ·   coordinate with Government agencies, notaries and other land and real estate
        professionals in order to implement straightforward and effective processes for
        conducting transactions; and
    ·   coordinate with Government concerning establishment of a well-founded fiscal cadastre.

(b) Operational Services ­ This component focused on provision of data to the registration
offices, primarily through conducting a program of systematic registration. The specific
activities enumerated in the PAD were to:

    ·   conduct a public awareness and communication campaign that will include professional
        organizations, Government, and the general public;
    ·   create a series of registration index maps for each Registration office through a mixture
        of new mapping, revised mapping and use of existing mapping;
    ·   carry out data collection from organizations with records relating to rights in land and
        real estate and archiving of these records at the relevant Registration office; and

                                                  2

    ·   conduct systematic adjudication of rights and registration of rights in accordance with an
        agreed schedule.

(c) Training ­ Under the project, training programs for the following groups of stakeholders were
anticipated: (1) staff of Gosregister; (2) individuals and firms hired to conduct systematic
registration; and (3) representatives of local government, civil society, and organizations whose
activity is tied with registration of rights in immovable property. The specific activities
enumerated in the PAD were to:

    ·   establish training centers for the ongoing in-service training of Registration office staff
        and personnel involved in the Project;
    ·   establish a training program, professional organizations and other activities for the
        promotion of real estate markets; and
    ·   establish a long term training program to cater to the future needs of Gosregister and a
        private professional capacity in land and real estate markets.


1.6 Revised Components

N/A

1.7 Other significant changes

While there was no formal revision of the Project, there were a number of changes in design and,
scope deserving note. Soon after Board approval, the Swedish International Development
Cooperation Agency (Sida) agreed to finance the technical assistance elements of the Project,
which were estimated at appraisal at US$700,000. Parallel financing from Sida for technical
assistance continued through the life of the Project.

In December 2004 a two-year extension of the original project closing date of December 31,
2005 was approved. This allowed Gosregister to expand the program of systematic registration
to include agricultural lands that were not included in the original project design. This program
of `rural' systematic registration entailed the use of slightly different field methodologies than
the urban program, and benefited from the agricultural land reform work undertaken as part of
the Agriculture Support Services Project (ASSP). The ASSP had assisted the large farming
collectives that had existed under Soviet times to carry out a program of distribution of land
shares to members of the collective. This documentation was then used in the `rural' systematic
registration under the Project.

The appraised version of the Project had focused on the paper-based system of registration, with
limited expenditures for automation or development of a unified computerized system. As
implementation moved forward, and the paper-based system was successfully designed and
rolled out, the Bank agreed to increased attention to development of automated registration at the
Local Registration Offices (LROs) as well as conceptual design of a nationwide automated land
information system.

On November 22, 2007, a second one-year extension in the project closing date was approved by
the VP to allow financial bridging to the follow-on Second Land and Real Estate Registration
Project (SLRERP).

                2. KEY FACTORS AFFECTING IMPLEMENTATION AND OUTCOMES

2.1 Project Preparation, Design and Quality at Entry
The Task Team was careful to ensure that two key pillars for successful land registration projects
were in place prior to appraisal. These were: (1) establishment of a reliable legal basis for
registration; and (2) clarification of institutional roles in operation of the system. This required
more time than originally planned for preparation of the Project, but was critical for project
success. As reflected in the PAD, the team also drew critical lessons from earlier operations
globally and with specific reference to the ECA region. Among these were the importance of
stand-alone projects as opposed to a land registration component of a larger project, the
advantages of a single agency design (where both cadastral and registration functions are
handled under one roof), the potential pitfalls of focusing on technology and high standards of
land parcel survey, and, particularly in the case of Europe and Central Asia (ECA), the tendency
for borrowers to consider the government rather than the population as the key beneficiary of the
Project.

The most important factor bearing on the quality of project preparation and design was the nature
of Government commitment, and in particular, the emergence of a well-placed "champion" who
took strong leadership responsibility for laying a solid foundation for project implementation.
Through partnership with this key counterpart, the Bank was able to get agreement on the
important issues of project objective and design, and institutional roles, in particular
establishment of the single-agency model. Government commitment went beyond the issue of a
project champion. The Project was treated as a priority by the Ministry of Finance and necessary
actions from Government's side, in particular policy adjustments and clarifications, were
forthcoming.

The resulting project design was relatively simple and straightforward. The PDO of stimulating
development of land and real estate markets was clear, though ambitious. In fact, the Project
could only play a supporting role in achieving this objective. Its attainment was dependent on
the broader macro-economic situation and on policy decisions beyond the project's scope.
However, aiming for something less ambitious would have brought the PDO into the range of
direct project outputs rather than outcomes.

The project design incorporated to a very large extent existing capacities with respect to
immovable property. Gosregister was established on the basis of the previous Bureaus of
Technical Inventory (BTIs), a Soviet era organization responsible for tracking information on
residential properties, and the State Land Agency, responsible for land management and
administration, primarily in rural areas. Data were pulled from these two bodies, as well as other
sources, in establishing the immovable property data base for the Project. The Project was able
to benefit in particular from the broad coverage of topographic mapping of adequate scale that
was produced during the Soviet period and that was still relatively current.
A Social Assessment (SA) was conducted during preparation that included a survey
questionnaire, focus group discussions, in-depth informant interviews and participant
observation in the BTI and State Land Agency offices. This was followed by a final stakeholder
workshop in Bishkek. The main findings of the SA were incorporated in the project design.



                                                  4

The PAD identified a broad set of potential project risks and included reasonable corresponding
mitigation measures. Overall, project risks were rated as "substantial" due primarily to
uncertainties in the macro-economic setting, and to potential problems in further elaboration of
the legal and regulatory environment necessary for facilitating market growth.

2.2 Implementation

Government commitment to the Project continued through the implementation phase.
Appropriate macro-economic and sectoral policies conducive to achievement of the PDO were
adopted or adhered to. Key staffing decisions remained positive and constructive during nearly
the entire period of implementation. One problem area was the lack of necessary counterpart
funds in the first two years of implementation, which had a retarding influence on the pace of
implementation with respect to operational expenditures and civil works.

The original Director of Gosregister played a critical role in getting the new registration system
up and running, in introducing system performance improvements over time, and in managing
the highly successful program of systematic registration. A modest sized Project Implementation
Unit (PIU) was established within Gosregister to manage the day-to-day aspects of the Project,
reporting to Gosregister's Deputy Director for Registration. Staffing of the PIU was generally
good to very good. At the time of appraisal, Gosregister did not have adequate staffing slots to
manage the Project. In addition, restrictions on civil service pay would have made the attraction
of high quality project staff very difficult, if not impossible.

Quality of service standards and governance were major issues that needed to be dealt with
during implementation. As noted in the original SA, the governance and performance standards
of the agencies that were combined to form Gosregister were not high. This was a situation that
was prevalent throughout Government.

With project support and in accordance with its design, Gosregister implemented a number of
measures to establish and maintain high quality service standards, to reduce the opportunities for
corruption, collusion, and fraud, and to increase accountability. These included:

        (i)     an extensive country-wide awareness campaign during the initial years of the
                Project and then again at the local level immediately prior to initiating systematic
                registration efforts in a given locale which did an effective job of informing
                citizens about their rights, as well as processes for systematic registration and
                subsequent transactions;
        (ii)    collaborative arrangements with non profit groups providing legal aid related to
                land and real estate issues, including facilitating working space in some local
                registry offices, exchanging data, and involving these groups in consultations;
        (iii)   a simplified registration process;
        (iv)    posting information on fees, documents, processing times, procedural
                requirements, etc. in the registry reception areas;
        (v)     official premium fees for urgent service;
        (vi)    the Gosregister institutional motto "honesty and competence";
        (vii)   a complaint box; a rigorous monitoring system; clear physical and procedural
                separation of front office (customer interaction) and back office (registration and
                archiving) functions thereby separating processors from customers.


                                                  5

         (viii) use of registry revenue to increase staff pay for good performance and thereby
                creating an incentive for honesty;
         (ix)   a quantitative and qualitative survey of customer opinions covering the areas of
                all local registries conducted as the Project was nearing completion; and
         (x)    an ongoing program of staff monitoring, training, and where necessary,
                replacement.

These efforts are remarkable, especially in the broader Central Asian context where corruption is
common, and anti-corruption measures tend to be weak.

Gosregister and the PIU were also successful in managing the program of systematic registration.
The approach of low-cost, pragmatic methods that was agreed at appraisal was pushed even
farther during implementation. For example, it was found that data on apartment units could be
accessed on a large-scale basis through coordination with the various communal housing
authorities. Field methods associated with the program were also refined and improved to
increase productivity. As a result, the pace of the systematic registration program ran well ahead
of the appraisal estimates. The target of 600,000 urban property units registered was reached
early in the third year of implementation and at a much lower cost per property than anticipated.

While there was no formal mid-term review, there was discussion during regular supervision
missions about allowing the systematic registration programs to continue operation in the urban
areas beyond the agreed target. Subsequently, Government expressed interest in expanding
systematic registration to agricultural areas. This was fully in keeping with the PDO and the
component design of the Project. To conduct the proposed rural program required an extension
of the project closing date of two years. Preliminary agreement was reached during the
September/October 2004 supervision mission and a Letter of Notification of Extension Date was
issued in December 2004.

In retrospect, these changes should perhaps have been subject to a formal restructuring which
explicitly approved this use of project savings. However, the Project was regarded as highly
successful by both the Government and the Bank and an informal restructuring was viewed as
adequate.

Gosregister and the Bank agreed to a cautious, gradually intensifying approach for using
Information Technology (IT) to support and operate its registration system. The register was
first established in a manual form and IT was applied only for data acquisition. A digital register
database was created and finally a full fledged automated registration system (ARS) was
introduced. ARS initially operated in parallel to the manual system, but has been adopted as the
legal register in the capital, Bishkek, and two other large offices. It will eventually become the
legal register across the country. The application for the map data integration to ARS is under
development. The gradual approach, especially considering the questions of capacity and
resources, ensured reliable registration operations at all times while allowing progress towards a
modern and efficient registration system.

Technical assistance made an important contribution to the Project during implementation.
There have been two Sida-funded technical assistance programs to Gosregister. The first,
running from 2000 to 2006, was to provide direct support to implement the activities under the
Project, and involved technical assistance with systematic registration, establishment of land

                                                6

registry offices, development of a cadastral manual, and training in new processes and
procedures. This included study tours to Sweden and Lithuania that were highly instructive.
The annual cost of the first Sida-funded program was roughly US$450,000. The second
program, running from 2006 to 2009, has provided technical assistance in areas such as mapping,
cadastral surveying, law, information technology and valuation. The annual cost of the second
phase programs increased to nearly US$700,000. The Sida-funded consulting team was closely
involved with supervision missions, and developed its annual work programs in coordination
with input from Gosregister and the Bank task team. The Project would not have been able to
accomplish what it did without the parallel involvement of Sida.

Even though the project results targets were already achieved by the end of calendar 2007
(including the target of registering rural areas which had been added in association with the
initial two year extension of the closing date), the closing date was further extended for a third
year in order to enable continuity of project management capacity for the follow-on project.

2.3 Monitoring and Evaluation (M&E) Design, Implementation and Utilization

A monitoring and evaluation system relied on six regional monitoring officers that were
responsible for regular site visits to the 50 local registration offices. These regional officers
reported to the national Monitoring and Evaluation (M&E) officer in the PIU, submitting reports
regularly in an agreed format. The M&E system was geared to tracking project outputs as well
as data on project outcomes, and also tracked progress in putting in place the components of
project implementation.

Despite a lack of clarity in the PAD with respect to quantified indicators for the PDO, tracking of
the number of sales and mortgages, and the value of the latter was initiated at the local level
early in project implementation. Information on key project outputs was also tracked including
the number of sporadic registration of rights, the number of property units covered by systematic
registration, the number of properties for which title was regularized (cases with incomplete or
contradictory documentation), and the number of unresolved cases. During the process of
monitoring of the systematic registration program, regional specialists not only controlled the
quality and the speed of works on systematic registration, but also organized meetings and
gatherings with communities, villagers and local government employees. Further, regional
monitoring specialists coordinated interaction between local registration offices, local
government, and city administrations. This arrangement served as the key to the success of the
systematic registration of land shares.

Indicators were tracked concerning the quality of services provided, including the number of
complaints lodged, and spot checks were made during site visits on consistency with agreed
registration procedures, including transparency of registration and pricing. All information about
customer interface was analyzed by the regional monitoring specialists and was then submitted
to the PIU and Gosregister management.

The simple and straightforward design of the Project allowed for and M&E system with clearly
defined indicators which can be used to track trends. The quality of the data was cross checked
during site visits by supervision missions and found to be reliable. Data on the PDO indicators
were consistent with other information available on the development of immovable property
markets. In particular, the data on mortgages were closely scrutinized by the Bank's task team,
with cross checks made through the Rural Finance II Project.

                                                 7

Sustainability of the M&E system will require mainstreaming the functions of the monitoring
officers directly into Gosregister. Work on this is included in the follow-on Second Land and
Real Estate Registration Project (SLRERP). Completion of the program of systematic
registration will reduce the ongoing M&E costs for the registration system and should ease the
process of mainstreaming.

2.4 Safeguard and Fiduciary Compliance

The Project did not involve any safeguard policies. There was limited amount of office repair
and small scale reconstruction, which at the time of appraisal rated a category C for
Environmental Assessment. It did not involve involuntary resettlement, natural habitats, or
forest areas.

The financial management system was run by the PIU and performed well during the life of the
Project. It was capable of recording all transactions and balances, and supported the preparation
of regular financial statements that were submitted to the Bank on time. Internal control systems
and procedures established by the PIU ensured the reliability of accounting records, and
safeguarding of the Project's resources and assets.

2.5 Post-completion Operation/Next Phase

While many issues of sustainability were addressed by the first Project, some will receive
additional attention in the SLRERP. These include mainstreaming of the functions of the PIU
into Gosregister, further elaboration of the financial sustainability arrangements of the
registration system (in particular financing system overhead costs that have been financed by
IDA), and further capacity building focusing on spatial data, computerized systems, and
registration in informal settlements.

The majority of local registry offices (being state-owned enterprises) are now self-financing out
of revenues generated from services rendered. However, operations of Gosregister headquarters
have been financed by a combination of regular government budget, contributions as part of
surplus distribution from local registry offices, and the IDA LRERP Credit and the IDA
SLRERP Grant (for PIU activities including all local consultants). Under SLRERP, alternative
arrangements will be developed to enable registry revenue to be used to finance key functions
related to the entire network, such as performance monitoring and IT support. Agency practices
including financial management and procurement for registry operations, records management,
and support for strategy development and communications also require improvement. Some
types of real property still need to be included in the registry system ­ these include properties in
some of the "novostroiki" (informal urban settlement) areas as well as non-private lands and real
estate such as urban parks, government properties, land around apartments, and pastures.
Cadastral mapping also needs to be gradually upgraded.

                                   3. ASSESSMENT OF OUTCOMES

3.1 Relevance of Objectives, Design and Implementation

Development of land and real estate markets through establishment of a reliable system for
registration of rights in immovable property has remained a high priority for the Kyrgyz
Republic throughout the implementation phase of the Project. The Government's Country

                                                8

Development Strategy (CDS) for 2007-2010 focuses on four strategic pillars ­ growth-oriented
economic development and improving the business environment, governance and transparency
in public administration, human development, and environmental sustainability. The Kyrgyz
Government has identified that a reliable and well-functioning system for registration of rights in
immovable property remains a key government priority in the CDS, and important for private
sector development in both rural and urban areas as well as for public sector management.

The recently approved Joint Country Support Strategy (JCSS) for 2007-2010, which builds on
the Government's development goals as described in the CDS, contains three key objectives: (a)
economic management consistent with strong and sustained pro-poor growth; (b) reducing
corruption, improving governance, and effective public administration; and (c) building
sustainable human and social capital through education. The project targeting of security of
property rights and the performance of property markets, and of improving the quality and
transparency of government services remains relevant to this agenda.

3.2 Achievement of Project Development Objectives

The Project achieved its development objective of supporting development of markets for land
and real estate and the more intensive and effective use of land and real estate. The number of
mortgages, which were virtually nil prior to the Project, reached a cumulative annual total of
22,400 in the year 2002, the first year when most of the registration offices were operational, and
doubled to 45,300 in the year 2007. The cumulative value of mortgages registered within a one
period increased by more than 10 times between 2002 and 2007 to reach US$1.1 billion, roughly
one-third the value of annual Gross Domestic Product (GDP) for the country. Most of these
mortgages were short term loans backed by immovable property as collateral. In 2007,
outstanding (longer-term) residential mortgages were valued at US$87 million, or roughly 2.6%
of GDP compared with virtually nothing prior to the Project. Underlying this growth in
mortgage market activity was the growth in average property values, which increased from
slightly less than US$5,000 in 2002 to over US$30,000 in 2007. Sales markets also roughly
doubled between 2002 and 2007, going from 25,900 sales at the beginning of the period to
48,100 at the end.

   30000                                                                          sales

                                                                                  mortgages

Most of the growth in immovable property markets to this point has been concentrated in urban
areas. This in part reflects government restrictions on the sale of agricultural land that persisted
until late in the life of the Project. These restrictions were motivated by concerns about possible
distress sales and accumulation of agricultural land holdings that would have negative social

                                                  9

impacts in the rural areas. Evidence from the Rural Finance II Project shows, however, that
much of the short term mortgaging has been used for agricultural purposes, where residential
properties have been utilized as collateral. Until more than mid-way through project
implementation, the Kyrgyz Agricultural Finance Corporation (KAFC), which was established
with World Bank assistance under the Rural Finance I Project, was the primary source of
mortgage money extended in the country.

The Project played a direct contributory role to this economic development. Lending institutions
require documentation of ownership rights from the registration system prior to considering any
mortgage lending application. The fact that the Project was able to: (a) establish a reliable and
trusted system of registration of title, and (b) carry out systematic registration of nearly all
properties in the country over the relatively short time span, provided a necessary basis for
property market development. Other essential conditions for market development had been
established prior to appraisal: instituting private property rights and putting in place policies
conducive to property market functioning. Most of these policy changes were motivated by
considerations broader than the scope of the LRERP. However, the rationale and promise of the
Project helped direct this policy thinking. Preparation of the LRERP and development of the
Registration Law was carried out in the context of a broader dialogue on establishment of a
market based economy. As noted above, the Project also benefited from the policy and
institution building work carried out by the Rural Finance I and Rural Finance II Projects.

The linkage between Project outputs and outcomes is illustrated by the accomplishment in the
area of systematic registration. At the time of appraisal a target of 600,000 properties was set for
the systematic registration program. This was in keeping with benchmarks for similar programs
in other countries with respect to both per property cost and the relatively weak and untested
institutional capacity. This target was greatly exceeded thanks to the efforts of the implementing
agency, Gosregister, and the supporting commitment from Government. The actual number of
properties covered by systematic registraton exceeded 2.5 million by the project closing, leaving
slightly more than 200,000 properties for which contradictory information on current rights
requires further deliberation prior to title registration. A significant accomplishment of the
Project was that of the 2.5 million properties registered, over 600,000 had lacked full
documentation, but as part of the program had these uncertainties dealt with and title conferred.
The extension of the closing date by a total of three years allowed time for conducting the
program of systematic registration of agricultural land. During those three years, roughly 1.25
million rural land parcels were registered. The rapid pace of the rural program was facilitated in
part by work undertaken by the ASSP, which had assisted Government in a program of
restructuring the large farming collectives and had issued land share documents to farmers well
ahead of the initiation of the rural systematic registration program.

The LRERP also achieved its target of establishing high standards of service delivery for the
registration system. The PAD had established an ambitious target of three days for completion
of registration. Spot checking during supervision shows that this target has largely been met.
The Cost of Doing Business (CODB) survey includes indicators for registration of property,
based on the example of a medium size business in proximity to the national capital. CODB
shows a total of eight days for registration in the Kyrgyz Republic, which ranks 17th
internationally, well ahead of the average of 30 days for the Organization for Economic Co-
operation and Development (OECD) countries. Considering that CODB includes steps prior to
registration proper, such as collection of necessary documentation and other Government

                                                 10

clearances, the CODB case study is in line with supervision findings of the time required for
registration.

A good deal of work was done under the LRERP on property valuation methodologies, and input
provided along with other stakeholders on development of legislation on an immovable property
tax. Both Sida, through its involvement on the Project, and USAID through its advisory services
to the Treasury of the Kyrgyz Republic, were active in this area. The PIU established a small
unit to work on property valuation questions. This work eventually became well advanced. The
PAD noted that implementation of the valuation methodologies would require adoption of
regulations that are beyond the scope of the Project. In fact, consideration of property tax
legislation and supporting implementing regulations became hung up in Parliament for political
reasons and had not been adopted by the close of the LRERP.

3.3 Efficiency

An Economic Rate of Return (ERR) for such a project is extremely challenging to carry out due
to the complex and broad economic impacts of a registration system. Examination on the basis
of cost effectiveness clearly shows the high level of efficiency achieved by the Project. About
two thirds of the project costs were devoted to systematic registration, the rest being devoted to
establishment and operation of the registration system itself. With 2.5 million properties
registered, the per property cost of the systematic registration program comes to about US$2.75.
By international comparison, this is very low compared with costs within ECA which can range
from an average of $5 per parcel in the Caucasus to around $120 per parcel in the Balkans.
Furthermore, there is no evidence of any problems relating to disputes, either legal or in
boundaries. While the very low wage cost and the inclusion of apartments (for which separate
land parcel surveys are not required), contributed to this result, management attention to
efficiency also played a significant role. Achieving an average cost as low as in the LRERP has
rarely been accomplished in international practice.

As a result of simplifying previous steps and procedures, the cost of land-related transactions
(e.g., notary fees, "State Duty", and registration fees) in the Kyrgyz Republic has been brought
down from over 7 percent to a negligible level. Currently, land related transaction costs are
estimated at less than 2 percent of property value for large and expensive estate and less than 1
percent for houses and apartments. This compares with a regional average of 2.7 to 4.3% in
OECD countries.

3.4 Justification of Overall Outcome Rating

Rating: Highly Satisfactory

The development rationale behind the Project remained relevant throughout implementation and
continues to be relevant. A reliable system for registration of immovable property rights is a key
building block of a well functioning market economy. The development of land and real estate
markets was achieved, as evidenced by the increased number of secondary transactions (sales),
and more intensive use of land and real estate was achieved through the development of
mortgage - as evidenced by the number and value of mortgages. The establishment of a reliable
and well-functioning system was supported by the creation of a country-wide registration
network and development of a full regulatory and procedural framework for transactions
allowing for registration to take place in a matter of days. This places the Kyrgyz Republic

                                                11

among the top tier of countries internationally. Of particular note in comparison with other
countries in the region and internationally is the growth in the mortgage market during project
implementation. This was accomplished at a comparatively low cost. In particular, the per
property costs of the systematic registration program are among the lowest in international
practice. While the growth of real property markets was dependent on economic factors well
beyond the scope of the Project, the Project did all that could be expected to facilitate this
expansion. In terms of relevance, achievement of the PDO, and efficiency, the Project
performed at a level consistent with a highly satisfactory rating.
3.5 Overarching Themes, Other Outcomes and Impacts

(a)     Poverty Impacts, Gender Aspects, and Social Development
The Project did not specifically target these social objectives. It did have positive impacts,
however. With respect to poverty, registration of rights for virtually the entire country will
protect the economically disadvantaged from potential loss of their land and housing rights that
might otherwise occur without a reliable registration system. Initial (systematic) registration was
carried out at Government expense. The high rate of regularization of property rights also
contributed to the poverty impact. Subsequent transactions can be registered at a reasonable cost
that will allow the lowest income groups to continue to benefit from the system.

The Registration Law provides for equal treatment of rights held by women. For example,
spouses and minors are protected and notaries have been required to ensure this protection.
Examination of actual operation of the registration system has confirmed that equal treatment of
women in practice. However, there are differences in the extent to which men versus women
hold land or real estate (and therefore are Gosregister customers), which result from the wider
cultural and socioeconomic context of the country. There are issues of discrepancies between
the formal law and customary law, primarily in rural areas, where women's rights to land in
situations of family break-up or inheritance are not secured under customary practices. Sida
financed gender awareness training for Gosregister staff, and these issues will need to be tracked
in the future.

(b)     Institutional Change/Strengthening

Establishment of Gosregister and the system of local registration offices represents a significant
accomplishment in terms of institutional development in the Kyrgyz Republic. A lot of effort
was made to establish Gosregister's identy and move the staff from the old BTI and Land
Agency to one office in a new location in each municipality. These offices included specific
physical design features to promote good governance and client service. Training and new
operational procedures were also stressed. It is a case where a significant qualitative advance has
been made over the institutional structures, client interface, and government service standards
that were inherited from the Soviet period and that were still prevalent at the time project
implementation commenced. It is recognized by Government as a good case of successful
capacity building and institutional development that can serve as a model over the longer term.

(c)     Other Unintended Outcomes and Impacts (positive or negative)

The establishment of Gosregister through the merger of the BTIs and the State Land Agency
created a body with a broad mandate on land issues. Gosregister was simultaneously responsible
for registering rights and for land management functions that had a direct bearing on the creation

                                                12

or modification of rights. In many other countries these two functions are handled by separate
agencies. A number of Non-Government Organizations (NGOs) and donors were critical of this
arrangement and argued to shift functions out of Gosregister to avoid this potential conflict of
interest. The Bank understood the basis of these concerns and in discussions with Gosregister
pointed out that a mandate this broad was not considered international best practice. The Bank
did not insist on an institutional restructuring, but remained on alert to evidence on any actual
abuse of powers.


3.6 Summary of Findings of Beneficiary Survey and/or Stakeholder Workshops

A beneficiary survey was conducted in 2007 under the auspices of the Bank-Netherlands
Partnership Program to assess client attitudes toward the registration system. Client feedback
indicated general satisfaction with operation of the registration offices, which was a distinct
improvement over the findings of the initial Social Assessment that was carried out in 1999. In
2007 services of Gosregister were rated as "average" by clients. There was widespread
satisfaction with the speed of service, the fees were considered affordable and reasonable, and
the level of physical accessibility of the registration offices was rated as quite good. The value
of Gosregister's mission to facilitate the property markets was largely recognized. There were
high rates of understanding and use of Gosregister to secure ownership rights and utilize its
services for credit. Gosregister was also seen as being generally fair in dealing with clients.

At the same time, areas for further attention were identified. These included greater
accountability of staff for quality of work, the need for more training and retraining
opportunities, and for more effective information and public outreach. About 1/3 of clients and
organizations thought that there was corruption, and about half of these reported directly
encountering it. Some professional organizations cited making regular informal payments for
services. Respondents who reported on informal payments indicated that they were in regards to
accelerating service delivery, not to altering the content of the rights being registered or already
registered. Use of the guarantee fund is virtually nil due to lack of applications. On other
complaints, clients indicated a lack of recourse to appeal decisions taken by Gosregister. Further
work on checks and balances concerning decisions about registration, and accountability for
mistakes is needed. (See Annex 5 for a fuller discussion of the results of the beneficiary
survey.).

                      4. ASSESSMENT OF RISK TO DEVELOPMENT OUTCOME

Rating: Moderate

Gosregister has successfully maintained its institutional integrity. However, there is an ongoing
risk of politicization of the organization that would hinder the efficiency, quality, and reliability
of the registration system. This could come in the form of inappropriate management
appointments or in the introduction of policies that would not be conducive to the continued
effective functioning of the system. High level dialogue between the Government and the Bank,
if necessary, on the importance of maintaining the integrity of the system would be the most
effective way of addressing this risk.

Trends in the overall macro economic situation or disruptions to the financial sector could have
an impact on future property market development. Impact of the global economic and financial

                                                 13

crisis is already having an impact in the Kyrgyz Republic. Introduction of policies that are not
conducive to property market activity could also have a negative impact on maintenance or
expansion of the development accomplishments of the Project. While it is difficult to address
global influences, Government has demonstrated a continuous commitment to appropriate
economic, financial, and sector policies that would likely minimize the negative impacts of
broader economic influences over the longer term.

There will be a need for a continuous effort to address staff capacity and to deal with governance
and corruption issues within the system. Though this is tied to the broader question of
institutional integrity, it will need to be addressed regardless of any other possible developments
bearing on the future of the registration system. This will mean maintenance and development of
appropriate training programs, regular independent reviews or audits of performance of the
registration system, and elaboration of appropriate human resource policies. The follow-on
Project will be addressing these issues during its implementation. The follow-on Project will
also be assisting Gosregister in further elaboration of a financial sustainability model for the
registration system. While much progress has been made under the LRERP, there are still some
elements of financial sustainability, including provision of services to the low-volume rayons
and integration of PIU functions into Gosregister, that need to be dealt with.

                    5. ASSESSMENT OF BANK AND BORROWER PERFORMANCE

5.1 Bank Performance

(a) Bank Performance in Ensuring Quality at Entry

Rating: Satisfactory

The Bank played a key role during project preparation in guiding Government on fundamental
issues of establishing a title registration system and in best practices with respect to project
design. As discussed in Section 2.1 above, the Bank team took the time to ensure that essential
pillars of future project success ­ a solid legal foundation, and clarification of institutional roles ­
were in place prior to appraisal. In 1997, tGovernment was not keen on the project idea, and
there was little resonance with counterparts in various potential implementing agencies on the
importance of the possible market development impacts. Perseverance by the Task Team,
combined with coordination with other donors finally resulted in building sufficient consensus
within Government on objectives and legal/regulatory requirements to allow project preparation
to move forward. When opportunities did open up on the Government side, the Task Team was
quick to recognize and respond to them.

The Bank was clear about best practice elements that should figure in the project design. These
included a single agency model, maximum use of existing institutional capacity and data,
utilization of a self-financing model for the registration system, and focus on client service and
other outputs rather than technological tools or inputs in the basic conceptualization of the
Project. The Bank also made the right choice in not attempting to attach this activity as a
component to a larger investment intervention, but to go with a stand-alone project that was
relatively simple and straightforward to design and implement. This approach was judged as an
important contributing factor of success by the Quality Assurance Group (QAG) in its Quality of
Supervision Assessment 6 (QSA6) assessment of the Project.


                                                 14

The Bank ensured that the appropriate skill mix was included in the Task Team. Technical
aspects of the Project were well covered by the Team, which was able to establish a solid rapport
with Government counterparts based on the quality of advice and information that was being
provided.

Start up of the registration system was designed in a phased manner, with priority orientation to
the larger urban offices. This was consistent with the PDO, given the level of market activity
and value of properties. The Bank was supportive of establishment of a PIU. This was
consistent with practice in other Bank projects, as well as projects of other donors in the Kyrgyz
Republic. While this created a dual professional track between PIU staff and staff of
Gosregister, it is unlikely that the necessary skills would have been attracted to the Project absent
a PIU.

In retrospect, the risk assessment contained in the PAD appears to have been a bit too cautious.
The overall risk rating was "Substantial". The risk of insufficient demand for land and real
estate for market activity to pick up was rated as "High". Further, there were concerns about the
population's reaction to the new registration system, as well as that of local government and
notaries, that turned out to be overstated. It should be added that adherence to the risk mitigation
measures listed in the PAD was an important element of overall project success.

The PAD was a bit vague on the monitoring and evaluation program. The basic design of
regional monitors conducting site visits and being involved in monitoring progress on the
systematic registration program as well as the public information programs were agreed by this
point, but it was only with practice that the format and details of the monitoring reports were
elaborated. The Task Team could have done a better job in identifying key performance
indicators for the PDO, as these were not well laid out in the PAD and rather were elaborated as
project implementation moved forward.

(b) Quality of Supervision

Rating: Satisfactory

Supervision missions were conducted on average three times a year, which allowed for fairly
regular face-to-face interaction on project issues. Supervision reporting was likewise regular and
consistent over time in tracking the key output indicators as well as progress on immovable
property market development. Next steps and follow up actions were agreed in detail with
counterparts, included in Aide Memoires and in reporting to management, and subsequently
tracked. The Bank team worked in close cooperation during implementation with the consultant
team financed by Sida to provide technical assistance to Gosregister.

There were no major unforeseen developments that threatened the implementation path of the
Project or its strategy for achieving the PDO. Issues that did come up were identified in a timely
manner and with appropriate attention to implications for the overall development objectives.
Two important areas of dialogue during the supervision phase were improvement of the financial
sustainability model for both Gosregister and the system of local registration offices, and the
phased introduction of automated technologies in the operation of the registration system. The
lack of major emerging issues, as well as the relatively intensive nature of the ongoing dialogue,
meant that a formal Mid-Term Review (MTR) was not held. Rather, issues were addressed on a

                                                15

rolling basis. These measures included, for example, (a) agreement to allow the systematic
registration program to continue after the initial target was attained in early 2003; (b) conducting
a mid-term social assessment in late 2003 and early 2004, and (c) agreement to expand the
systematic registration program to rural areas in the fall of 2004.

Fiduciary aspects were well supervised. Procurement issues were promptly and competently
attended to, with annual procurement plans used as a basis for tracking developments. Financial
management reporting was provided on a timely basis and in accordance with agreed formats.
Movement of Bank fiduciary staff to the field after the first few years of implementation of this
project allowed for more immediate contact and follow up on identified issues. No safeguards
policies were triggered by the Project. A mid-term social assessment was conducted to provide
feedback on perceived changes brought by the Project in comparison with the pre-project
situation and to identify areas for additional or new work. Toward the end of implementation a
beneficiary survey was carried out to again benchmark perceptions of project impacts and to
assist in the design of the follow-on project. During implementation, the Task Team was
attentive to the issues of inclusion and fairness with respect to lower income groups. The Team
also utilized findings on gender related issues that were generated by work financed by Sida, and
conducted by the Sida-financed consultants, as well as a study on women and land that was
financed by the Bank. Legal covenants were tracked throughout implementation, with the Task
Team exhibiting a reasonable amount of flexibility with regard to requirements for a formal mid-
term review.

The Project's Implementation Performance (IP) and Development Objectives (DO) ratings were
Satisfactory during the first four years of implementation. In the fall of 2004, the ratings were
increased to Highly Satisfactory, where they remained for the duration of the project life. These
ratings were consistent with the actual state of the Project and were well-founded and clearly
explained in the project reporting to management on the basis of the key performance indicators.

With design of the follow-on project, the Bank has been focusing on further improving the basis
for eventual full transition to long-term sustainability of project-related activities. This includes
merging the functions of the PIU into Gosregister and further strengthening the financial
sustainability of the system.

The Project was included in the QSA6 review of quality of supervision. The overall project
rating as well as those for all four major components was "Satisfactory" (2 on the 6 point scale).
The ECA Region concurred with these findings. One area of difference was the emphasis placed
by QAG on tracking potential elite capture of land and the issue of landless poor. These are
serious problems in many developing countries, but are largely absent in the Kyrgyz Republic,
which after independence has followed a policy of equal allocation of land rights to members of
the former large farming enterprises and formal recognition of rights to household plots.

(c) Justification of Rating for Overall Bank Performance
Rating: Satisfactory

The Bank's performance suffered from only minor shortcomings from identification to close.

5.2 Borrower Performance

(a) Government Performance

                                                16

Rating: Satisfactory

Once consensus was reached on the PDO, Government ownership and commitment remained
consistently strong. A key early step by Government was appointment of a leader for the Project
who proved to be central to achieving success. Government backed up this project "champion"
when politically sensitive decisions were taken concerning institutional structures and mandates,
and later in interaction with local government. A second area where the Government's
performance was strong was in establishing the legal and regulatory environment needed for the
PDO to be achieved. This included oversight in shepherding the draft Law on Registration
through Parliament, as well as legislative reform expanding and strengthening private property
rights in land and real estate. This legal foundation was followed up by regulatory and policy
changes to further support market development and to establish the new title registration system.
Government chose to maintain restrictions on the sale of agricultural land that were relaxed only
gradually over the life of the Project. The reason was the potential negative social consequences
in an environment where the population was unfamiliar with the operation of land markets and
where short-term financial incentives may have led low-income and other vulnerable segments
of the population to sell their land.

A third area where Government's performance has been strong is in protecting the institutional
integrity and mandate of Gosregister in the face of sporadic attempts by other agencies or bodies
to take over some or all of its registration functions. Government has also protected the quality
of leadership of Gosregister. Though there was a change in the position of Director in 2004 that
appeared to be at least in part politically motivated, this situation had been redressed by mid-
2005.

Despite this clear commitment, there were problems during implementation with counterpart
financing. This was true in the first two years of the Project and resulted in the only
"unsatisfactory" sub-rating for the Project, which occurred during 2002. The problem was
alleviated when IDA agreed to increase its financing share to 100% for civil works and operating
expenditures.

(b) Implementing Agency or Agencies Performance

Rating: Highly Satisfactory

Gosregister played the central role in the success of the Project. It maintained commitment not
only to the output targets, but to achievement of the broader developmental objectives.
Management of the newly-founded agency ensured that high quality staff were attracted to work
on the Project, and it also established lengthy programs of training, testing, and certifying of staff
inherited from the BTI's and Land Agency, as well as new hires, prior to rolling out the new
registration system. Staff training was part of a longer list of prior measures that had to be
fulfilled before a local registration office was certified to begin operations.

Gosregister pushed hard to get two model offices up and running ahead of credit negotiations.
These served as learning points for the broader roll out. These models were in the two locations
that had been included in the prior USAID pilot Project which focused on testing data collection
methods for systematic registration. By the time project implementation began, all the building
blocks were in place for successful roll out of the system nationwide.

                                                17

The remaining 48 offices were set up in the next two years, with Gosregister and PIU staff
directly involved at the local level in verifying office location and renovation, staff training,
delivery of necessary equipment and supplies, and public information work. For each office, an
opening ceremony was held attended by local government representatives, other stakeholders,
and frequently representatives of the media. Public commitment was made to achieving a higher
standard of service delivery than had been common in the Kyrgyz Republic in the past.

Management of Gosregister was determined to move the systematic registration program as
quickly and efficiently as possible. This too was facilitated by a public information campaign,
thorough training and testing of staff hired to do this work, careful monitoring of systematic
teams in the field, identification and elimination of bottlenecks, and creative approaches, such as
downloading large amounts of data from the Communal Housing Authorities and magnifying up
available maps where scales were inappropriately small. The network of neighborhood/block
representatives that had been established during the Soviet period was utilized as the key
outreach mechanism to the population ahead of and during the systematic registration work in a
given locale. Public viewing centers, convenient to the population, were opened for a period of 3
months following the initial field surveys to allow the population to verify or contend the survey
findings before titles were granted. It was Gosregister's adherence to a well conceived plan
combined with creative adjustments which allowed the systematic registration program to
accomplish much more than could reasonably have been assumed at the time of appraisal.

Gosregister understood the importance of a reliable M&E program, took the actions necessary to
put in place such a program, and accepted input from outside as to how the program could be
further strengthened. The information coming from the M&E program was used by management
to identify key issues for action and to guide adjustments to the project implementation plan.

Fiduciary aspects of implementation were well handled by the PIU. The financial management
work of the PIU was considered a good case example for the Bank's Kyrgyz lending program.
There was some decrease in performance in 2006 with a change in the financial management
staff, but this was eventually rectified. A few relatively minor procurement issues arose in the
final year of the Project, when the quantity of project procurement was too low to justify a PIU
procurement specialist, but overall procurement performance remained satisfactory.

An open door policy was maintained with respect to outside stakeholders and other donors and
dialogue was active with both. Among donors this included Sida, USAID, the EU, and the Swiss
Coordination Office. Relations with donors were not always smooth, particularly over the
question of the broad mandate that Gosregister enjoyed over land issues (see Section 3.5(c)
above). The relative weakness of civil society organizations (CSOs) in the Kyrgyz Republic, a
legacy of the Soviet period, meant that there were less active relations with CSOs than typical in
other regions for such projects. However, even these relations grew significantly by the end of
the project period. Relations with real estate professionals ­ real estate brokers, notaries, and
lending institutions (e.g., Kyrgyz Agricultural Finance Corporation (KAFC) were good.
Relations with local government were also good. Gosregister established 6 regional offices to
allow for more active interaction with oblast, rayon and municipal government. In Osh, the
second largest city in the country, the municipal government used the improved immovable
property data from Gosregister and public access to this data to curtail corruption associated with
the management of public lands.

Gosregister has worked actively on evolution of the business model for the registration system,
with the aim of achieving full long-term financial sustainability. The system as a whole has
proven its sustainability, but there are some issues remaining with respect to financing activities
at the center and provision of services to areas of the country with low levels of market activity
and demand. These issues, which in case were never intended to be resolved by the first Project,
are being handled under the follow-on SLRERP.

(c) Justification of Rating for Overall Borrower Performance

Rating: Satisfactory

In view of the minor shortcomings in Government performance, foremost of which were the
financing constraints, the overall borrower performance is rated as satisfactory, though
performance was clearly on the high end of that range.


                                       6. LESSONS LEARNED

The Project confirms a number of recognized lessons with respect to lending. Foremost among
these is the importance of Government ownership and commitment over the long term which
were evident in identification of a true champion for implementation of the Project and further,
stability over time of a qualified and high-performing management team. Continuity of staff was
also important on the Bank's side. This approach was deeply appreciated by the borrower and
allowed for building and maintaining a relationship of trust that was an important part of the
Project's success.

The Project benefited from a general approach of pragmatism. Very often development
objectives as well as project outputs can be held hostage to pre-conceived notions of how things
should be done, or are constrained by vested interests. The LRERP demonstrates what can be
accomplished when priority is given to developmental results and everything else is built in
concert with that. This was apparent in how the question of institutional arrangements was
solved, in the overall commitment to efficiency, and in the willingness to say no to technical
interests that could have hamstrung the Project. Of particular importance was the willingness to
say no to costly survey and mapping methodologies. While this approach may not be as fully
and readily applicable in other institutional, legal and socio-cultural settings, the general
principle remains true.

The LRERP also serves to confirm findings on the advantages of a single agency model for
handling registration and cadastre, and to approach these interventions through stand-alone
projects rather than as components in larger projects.

The Project reconfirmed the importance of a good M&E program. For a project such as this with
multiple points of service provision to the population, this could not have been accomplished,
even in a country of relatively small scale as the Kyrgyz Republic, without the use of regional
monitors and the insistence that those monitors spend their time in the field.

There were also a number of lessons with respect to Bank processes. In addition to staff
continuity noted above, the Project benefited from regular supervision missions. By

                                                19

piggybacking travel with other missions, the LRERP managed to have an average of three
supervision missions per year within the existing supervision budget constraints. Another lesson
was the correct approach of the Task Team to be patient during preparation to allow for a sound
foundation to be established, rather than to succumb to pressures to speed up project processing.

It may be debatable as to whether or not the Project was `over-supervised' by the Bank. The
QSA6 review made an observation in this regard. The appropriate level of Bank involvement
primarily depends on what the borrower needs to be successful, which varies from project to
project and country to country. During the life of the LRERP, the major share of local
registration offices was visited by Bank missions, some multiple times. This helped turn up
issues that could then be dealt with more broadly and was a necessary check on the maintenance
of service standards. While this level of mission presence is not possible in projects of much
larger scale, alternative and lower cost approaches ­ particularly the hiring of local consultants
with clear Terms of Reference (TORs) to assist in field work­ are possible and should be
pursued.

The benefits of the Project were and are wider than the direct benefits of achieving the PDO.
The well recognized success of this intervention had a positive impact on the broader Bank-
Borrower relationship and on the reputation of the Bank in the Kyrgyz Republic. Further, it is
useful as a model of success for land registration and land administration projects more broadly.

    7. COMMENTS ON ISSUES RAISED BY BORROWER/IMPLEMENTING AGENCIES/PARTNERS

(a) Borrower/implementing agencies

Ministry of Finance (A. Kozhoshev, Deputy Minister)

Hereby, the Ministry of Finance of the Kyrgyz Republic having examined the report on project
completion "Registration of land and real estate" IDA (33700) would like to inform you on the
following:

The Ministry of Finance of the Kyrgyz Republic likewise believes that this project has achieved
the desired goals and was quite efficient.

Taken as a whole, the Ministry of Finance of the Kyrgyz Republic agrees with the provided
Report on project completion; however, in part 2.2 it is stated that the lack of required
counterpart funds on the part of the government of the Kyrgyz Republic throughout the duration
the first half of the project and the limitations of IDA credit funds amount have exerted the
retarded influence on the project realization rate. In connection with this it is necessary to point
out that right up to year 2005 the project has not utilized the amounts of external financing that
had been previously approved in the budget. The implementation of the provided funding in
percentage ratio to the initially approved amounts comprised 90 per cent and less. The data is
provided in the table below:

  Year       The amount approved for a year, US dollars  Actually utilized amount within a year, US dollars
  2001                        1, 800                                          1, 082
  2002                        1, 800                                          1, 650
  2003                        1, 750                                          1, 100
  2004                        2, 000                                          1, 180
  2005                        1, 500                                          1, 386

                                                   20

In connection with the information stated above, we believe that the arguments supporting the
statement that the government of the Kyrgyz Republic did not provide funding on its part to the
desired degree are groundless and we turn to you with the request to eliminate that part from the
report on project completion.

In addition, in section 7 "Comments on the issues raised by Borrowers/Executive
Agencies/Partners"1 in Table (b) "Financing" the actual estimate of governmental co-financing of
the project comprised 1.12 mln. US dollars. However, in the Annex 7 in the part "Co-financing
and utilization of cash assets" it is stated that "the co-financing on the part of the government of
the Kyrgyz Republic amounted to 0.52 mln. US dollars, including 1.6 mln. US dollars."

You are kindly requested to take into consideration the indicated discrepancy in the final version
of the Report on project completion.2

Gosregister (A. Joldoshov, Director)

We've reviewed the draft final report prepared by both the World Bank and our Agency. We
believe that the information provided in the ICR in sufficient manner states the objectives of
development, the project structure and key factors affecting the project implementation and
outputs.

Due to the above mentioned fact the State Agency for Real Estate Registration under the
Government of the Kyrgyz Republic does not have any comments or suggestions with regard to
the draft final report on project completion and outputs.

(b) Cofinanciers

Swedish International Development Agency (Sara Holsbrink)

On page 6-7 in the report Sida's involvement in the project is mentioned. We would just like to
make a short comment and underline that for the second Sida funded program (2006-2009) Sida
changed the design of the project to some extent. The first Sida-funded program mainly included
technical assistance to the WB project through Swedesurvey AB . During the second program
the technical assistance to the implementation of the WB credit continued but the program also
had the purpose of deepening the institutional cooperation between Gosregister and the Swedish
National Land Survey, Lantmäteriet. So the objective for the second program was broader and
also focused on support to the development of the entire land administration sector and not only
land and real estate registration.

        Instead of section 7 this was actually intended to be a reference to Annex 1 "Project Costs and Financing".

        Subsequent to the receipt of this letter, the relevant sections of the main text section 2.2 and Annex 7 have
been revised.

Swedish National Land Survey, (Tommy Kalms, Project Manager)

There are a number of factors that have contributed to the successful results of the project and
some basics for success worth mentioning from the Sida project are:

· Client ownership
· Step by step approach in development
· Financial and technical sustainability
· Real property registration as part of the economic infrastructure
· Real property registration is a public service
· Close collaboration with the World Bank

Economic Analysis from LRERP PAD


1.        The project economic analysis found in the Kyrgyz Republic LRERP PAD was largely
guided by the Bank's "Economic Analysis of Rural Land Administration Projects". The main
benefits identified consisted of:

     ·    Increased tenure security,
     ·    Increased access to credit,
     ·    Revamped land and real estate markets, and
     ·    Improved information base for land administration.

Analysis of Actual Economic Impact

2.        The manner in which the economic benefits would be manifest ­ as per the project
design, as well as the current status of achievement for each of these benefits - is summarized in
the following table.

 The important message here is that the urban market is not the only objective indicator of increased security of
tenure. Other aspects of project progress, as is the case with agriculture sector, may involve situations where
benefits are more problematic to measure. This does not mean that such benefits are unimportant.

(HS = highly satisfactory rating, S = satisfactory rating)
3.       Regarding the benefits of the improved information base, there are a wide range of
indicators that can be mentioned. For instance, data on the quantities of information requests to
Gosregister is an important indicator, which would receive greater attention during the
implementation of the follow-on project. Additionally, there is plenty of anecdotal evidence
from the Urban Institute about the availability of information in Osh, which has been
contributing to improved land allocation decision making on public lands, and hence improving
the transparency of the allocation process. Very much like tenure security, some of the non-
quantifiable benefits may be very significant in this connection.

4.       The Project Appraisal Document (PAD) was less optimistic about the Project's potential
contributions and impact on the financial sector. The PAD stated, "due to the underdeveloped
financial sector in the Kyrgyz Republic, there is not expected to be a large impact through
strengthened bases for collateral, though the Project will support the development of a stronger
financial sector being promoted by the Rural Finance Projects and other IDA interventions".
This has proved to be a gross understatement. The Project's actual and potential impact on the
financial markets has been substantial, mainly by facilitating mortgage transactions and making
institutional credit available to large number of people. (See Annex 2 Table on Sporadic
Registration and Table 2 below.

5.       The cumulative value of mortgages from 2002 to 2007 reached US$ 2.7 billion, of which
roughly 3.22 %, or some US$ 87 million are estimated to be outstanding (but not cumulative)
residential mortgages5. The rest are regular loans backed by property mortgages. Residential
mortgages correspond to 2.56% of the GDP, which was estimated at about US$ 3.4 billion in
2007 using the current exchange rate. Development of the mortgage market has been
noteworthy. In the developed world, the ratio of the total value of current mortgages to Gross
National Product (GNP) may run as high as 60%. The implied mortgage market risks are limited
since the beneficiaries have proven repayment capacity. The only risk would be that a possible
but unlikely boom in the construction market may sharply bring down the property prices and

5
 This estimate is based upon Central Bank data supplied in February 2008 during an interview. As of the end of
December 2007, long term mortgages committed in both local and foreign currency amounted to KGS 3.3 billion,
corresponding to about US$ 86.84 million using the current exchange rate of US$ = KGS 38. The data represents
the outstanding mortgages. Up until recently, there were very few mortgage operations in the Kyrgyz Republic.


                                                     26

those properties that may have been foreclosed may constitute a risk for the Banking sector.
This last statement is based more on speculation than actual market performance in any
neighboring country.

6.       Using the above limited data, the estimated size of the real estate market (that means
value of properties changing hands as a result of sale transactions) is about US$ 1.46 billion,
which is slightly less than half of the GDP and far in excess of the Government Budget. Average
property prices have increased by more than six fold from 2002 to 2007. This may be good news
for the sellers and potential investors, but raises some concern regarding the access of the poor to
affordable housing as well as financial markets and services. The dramatic increase in property
prices is mainly due to the limited supply and excess liquidity on the international markets. The
construction industry in the Kyrgyz Republic is practically dormant, producing only a few
thousand new marketable properties per year. Meanwhile, these high prices should send strong
signals to a construction boom in the next few years.

7.       Prior to approval of the mortgage law in January 2005, there was very limited residential
mortgage activity in the Kyrgyz Republic. Before adoption of the Mortgage Law of 2005, the
Kyrgyz Republic already had a similar but less advanced legal framework for mortgages. This
was the Mortgage Law of 1999 (Law No: 41 of May 29, 1999) which was amended in 2001
(Law 61, June 28, 2001)6. The new law of January 2005 has a modern approach, incorporating
internationally recognized best practices for the liquidation of collateral through non-judicial
foreclosure proceedings.

8.       Total Value of Mortgages: The PIU consolidates all mortgage data when it is reporting
about project progress. Some of these mortgages are residential mortgages while the rest are
regular loans backed by immovable property collateral. Both types of mortgages are registered
by Gosregister. It also adds up the cumulative number and value of mortgages registered within
the given calendar year. Hence the numbers in Table 2 above do not reflect the total value of
'active'mortgages registered in the Gosregister or the total volume of active mortgage loans in
the country. Cumulatively adding up annual registered mortgages/equity both within the year
and over several years involves some double counting,because a given piece of property can be
used as collateral for shorter-term credit over and over again. The PIU has some information to
disaggregate genuine mortgages (that is residential mortgage) from commercial loans backed by
mortgage, and it has agreed to adopt this practice in the future.

9.       Mortgages for financing of agricultural inputs are made for shorter-term loans (up to 3
years). According to the Central Bank data, the amount of outstanding agricultural loans issued
in KGS for more than one year is about KGS 1.58 billion, or about US$ 41 million, suggesting
that there are many small loans backed by mortgage and mortgage loans are that are closed are
re-initiated using the same collateral.



6Article 1 of this Law (of 2001) defines the concept of mortgage as (a) a method of securing performance of a
monetary obligation or an obligation expressed in the monetary form against pledge of the ownership right or other
real right to the immovable property, and (b) under a mortgage agreement, one party (the mortgagee) being an
obligee under mortgage obligation (the principal obligation) shall have the priority right to satisfy his monetary
claims to an obligor under this obligation from the value of the mortgaged immovable property or property rights
(the subject of mortgage) of the other party (the mortgagor) over any other obligee of the mortgagor, except as
provided by this Law.

10.     New Construction: The Statistics Committee reports that some 2641 properties were
constructed during the first half of 2006 producing a total floor space of 314,300 m2. Some
2,302 of these properties were individual houses and remaining 339 were apartments. The
houses built outside of the large metropolitan areas are usually for the residential needs of the
owners and do not constitute marketable properties. Generalizing to an entire year, we notice
that an economy of 5 million people and US$ 3.4 billion GNP produces less than 1000 new
apartments in a year. This is a very low figure given the needs. The Statistical Committee
estimates that the market needs at least three times as many units as is being produced. The
needs are hence estimated to be at least three times larger, or some 1.5 million square meters.
The table below captures the essential details.

11.     An interesting observation is that the average size of the new apartments is excessively
large for the public. Some of these apartments are in new tall buildings in Bishkek. In order to
remedy the existing housing crunch in Bishkek, new mass housing projects are needed. This
could be a public project or a private undertaking. As of mid 2007, the Government has already
started financing affordable housing projects for its civil servants where owners purchase the
properties by long-term mortgage.

12.     New apartments in metropolitan areas cost about US$ 400 to 600 per square meter for
unfinished apartments. This cost is inclusive of the bare walls and very basic features of the
construction. The new owner must put in the finish and amenities as per individual tastes.
Finishing an apartment adds at least another 50% to the cost of the construction. The PIU
estimates that new apartments in prime location may run from US$ 800/m2 to US$1200/m2. As
such, the cost of most new apartments lies outside the range of the residential mortgage market,
which has a cap of US$ 100,000. Meanwhile, it costs about KGS 1800 (US$ 45) per square
meter to construct houses with basic features in remote areas. In Bishkek, it costs about US$ 250
per square meter to build a house. Interestingly, houses cost less to construct than apartments
and this seems to run counter to conventional wisdom of the modern economies.

13.     Transaction Costs: The PAD specified that the Project would facilitate the process of
sales and lease transactions in immovable property by simplifying previous steps and procedures,
and by providing legal guarantee from the State. This goal largely been achieved. The cost of
land-related transactions in the Kyrgyz Republic has been brought down to a negligible level.
Currently, land related transaction costs are estimated at less than 2 percent of property value for
large and expensive estate and less than 1 percent for houses and apartments. Transaction costs
for an average property are illustrated in the below table. This study was prepared in conjunction
with the requirements of Doing Business in the Kyrgyz Republic, sponsored by the World Bank.

14.     Agriculture Sector Improvements: Agriculture sector improvements have been less
noticeable except for an increase in the supply of agricultural credit. The underlying reasons are
(a) certain restrictions (as of early 20087) still applied on the transactions of agricultural land, and
(b) the Project's initial focus has largely been on the development of urban land markets. The
PAD explicitly stated that "because of the higher value of land and real estate in urban areas, and
the higher level of transactions anticipated there in the short-to-medium term, systematic
registration under the Project will be undertaken first in urban areas of the country".

15.     An important aspect of the rural and agricultural benefits is that it is not feasible to
quantify many of these impacts at this time. Project impact related to the land market in the rural
and agricultural domain has been limited. However, there may well be long-term hard-to-
measure impacts related to improved tenure security and associated investments (including those
which are self-financed) and/or improved land use for which rigorous attribution would be quite
problematic. This situation of problematic measurement in fact is very common in many
countries.

16.     Continuing further on this caveat, therefore, just like in other countries, measurement and
attribution of the "assumed" benefits in qualitative terms are problematic, especially in the short-
and medium-term. This situation is reminiscent of many phenomena in natural resource
management, which often has many important benefits that are difficult to measure. However,



7Most of these restrictions were lifted in early 2009.

that does not mean one should dismiss or ignore the benefits that cannot be readily quantified or
otherwise measured.

17.     Initial Targets and Achievements: Both the available data and investigations in the
country reveal that the Project has had a visible impact in the urban sector whereby physical
targets have been exceeded by comfortable margins. The below table provides information on
the overall project performance with respect to its physical targets.

                                  B. ANALYSIS OF FISCAL IMPACT

Fiscal Impact Analysis from Project Appraisal Document

18.     Transaction Tax: At the time of project design, the Government administered a
transaction tax. This tax was set at seven percent of the property value and it was collected by
notaries. The PAD made reference to a possible Government strategy for the introduction of
land and real estate taxes together with a phased removal of the transactions tax.

19.     Financial Sustainability of Registration Offices: The PAD stated that "the registration
offices as a whole will be self-financing net of taxes payable by these offices. However, with the
conservative assumptions laid out above, the taxes and net revenues of these offices will not be
sufficient to cover all Project costs". A good part of the Project funds (IDA funds) would
finance the initial registration on a systematic basis without fees being charged property owners.
This approach would be critical for the smooth functioning of the systematic process and for the
public's acceptance of the new system.

20.     Property Tax: The PAD predicted that as a result of undertaking systematic registration
in the Kyrgyz Republic, the investment costs of the Project would be more than offset by an
important increase in fiscal revenues, namely by augmenting collections from a tax on
immovable property (or simply stated the property tax). This achievement would be due to the
information generated by the land registration system.

21.     In order to analyze the impact of the Project on tax on immovable property (property tax),
the following assumptions were made.

    ·   300,000 properties would be covered by systematic registration and data filed at the
        registration offices;
    ·   the average value of each property would be estimated at USD 5,000; and
    ·   the tax rate applied to immovable property would be 0.3 percent.


                                                30

22.    Following these assumptions, the following conclusions were drawn:

       ·    average annual tax per property would amount to US$ 15 per year, and the total
            revenue generated each year would be US$ 4.5 million;
       ·    this would compare favorably with the total cost for implementation of the systematic
            registration program of roughly US$ 4 million and the amount of the IDA Credit of
            US$ 9.43 million.

Analysis of Actual Project Fiscal Impact Compared to PAD Targets

23.    Status of Transaction Tax: There has been a significant reduction in the transaction tax
rate. First it was reduced from 7% to 5%, and then, through introduction of the fixed fee
schedule, to something in the range of one to two percent. This is what many land registration
projects try to accomplish but often fail to do. The relationship between the percentage rate
reduction and aggregate value of total revenues generated is also interesting and worth exploring.
Lower revenue is often cited as an argument for not lowering rates, in the case in the Kyrgyz
Republic, the increased volume of transactions appears to have more than compensated for the
lower rates per transaction. Meanwhile, the transaction tax acquired a new name: "State Duty".
The State Duty is being collected in conjunction with various types of transactions involving
changes in ownership for vehicles, motorcycles as well as real estate. State duty is a local tax
and supports local administrations. The State Duty rates are shown in the following table for
transactions involving real estate. On average, it costs a real person about KGS 7500 in
transaction tax (State Duty) when buying a piece of property.

24.     Recovery of Sporadic Registration Costs: The project documents predicted that further
fiscal benefits would be generated by charging users for the cost of sporadic registrations (as
opposed to systematic registrations, which would be free of charge). This has largely been
achieved and most Land registry offices (LROs) have become financially self-sustaining. In
offices where systematic registration services have been completed, such as Osh and Bishkek,
fees from sporadic registrations provide a good source of LRO income.

25.     Sporadic Registrations: The Project has been able to perform some 808,000 sporadic
registrations. This is more than four times the target initially set. The owners usually need to
have a strong motive to compel them to seek sporadic registration that comes at a cost, versus
systematic registration where the service is free. The property owner asks for sporadic
registration when he/she needs to: (a) sell property, (b) get mortgage credit, (c) give away gifts
and bequeath inheritance, or (d) access to other social or public utility servicesassociated with
proof of address or property ownership. The costs vary from KGS 300 to about KGS 1,800 per
property, with a possible average in the neighborhood of some KGS 500 (or about US$ 12.5).
Therefore, the estimated total fee collections by the LROs should be roughly in the order of some
US$ 15.5 million over the years from 2002 to end of 2007.

Description                       Lower Bound              Upper Bound

Shop                              KGS 300                  KGS 500


26.     Registration Fees: The fees administered by the LROs have evolved from 2002 to
present. The registration fees originally were KGS100 for the standard sporadic registration.
This held until early 2005. Thereafter, through 2008, the fee was KGS 600 for a regular request
for sporadic registration, and twice that amount for a rush job. There are also set information
fees for copies of documents.

27.     Technical Inventory Fees. Up to 2005, the LROs were generating substantially more
revenue (generally twice as much) from conducting 'technical inventories'of buildings as
compared to registration fees. However, due to the increase in registration and information fees
and transactions, as of 2007, Gosregister's fees from registration and information exceeded
technical inventory income by 44%. For any building or apartment being registered, technical
inventory or building survey has been required if the property had not been registered within the
previous six months. Although strictly speaking technical inventory is not part of registration, it

                                                  32

is frequently perceived as being closely associated, due to the fact that it is administered by
LROs and is required legally as a prerequisite for many forms of registration. It is expected that
the Kyrgyz Republic will eventually follow the experience of other countries which have
transitioned to a market economy, where technical inventory requirements will gradually be
phased out once immovable property registration fees become sufficient to more fully cover
registry operations. Such reforms are also consistent with improvements in "doing business"
indicators..

28.      Status of Property Tax: Property tax has always been intended as a local tax, and hence
would affect the financial capability of municipal government. A basic enabling law was
approved in 2005, but the implementing regulations, which also require Parliamentary approval
were then pending through most of the project period. The valuation methodology was reviewed
in detail during 2004-05, and Gosregister submitted its proposal for an amendment with
proposed implementing regulations in the summer of 20058. Initially, the hold up was on the
legal side. Later, there was a delay due to internal disagreements on the methodology and
accessibility of valuation data, which remained unresolved. As of early 2008, the 2005 property
tax was still not operational. According to the proposed regulations the tax would first be
implemented in Bishkek and Osh on a pilot basis. Property valuation would depend upon
zoning, location, market reference prices as well as the base construction material used to build
the property. The rates would be 0.5% of assessed property value for dwellings and 1% for non-
dwellings (commercial estate). The property tax would supersede the road tax and emergency
situations tax collected by the LROs. The tax was beset by some controversy. Although not
decided, it was envisaged that the local governments would likely make the collections for the
property tax once it is instituted. There were many exclusions to the tax, such as public property
and infrastructure. The untaxed minimum would cover the elderly and low income people as
well as 1 or 2 bed room apartments, which are considered to be more of social shelters. In short,
it was the rich and well to do that the tax targets. The pilot applications in Bishkek and Osh
would target some 345,000 properties, but tax would be collected only from a fraction of these
properties due to planned exclusions (public properties) and exemptions (low-income families
with smaller dwellings). According to Gosregister's analysis, at full development, the
anticipated collection would be around KGS 183 million (or some US$ 4.81 million) which
would be more than what was initially predicted for the whole country, but accruing from two
cities only.

Broader Fiscal Impacts of LRERP

29.      Transaction Tax: The transaction tax is also called the State Duty on Transactions. It is
collected by notaries who keep 10% of the tax proceeds in return for the collection service. The
transaction tax is a local tax and it is co-mingled with all types of transaction taxes such as taxes
levied on both movable and immovable assets: selling of a car or a motorcycle as well as sale of
real estate property. As discussed above, the applicable rates have changed several times. Prior
to adopting the current flat rate, local governments have lamented that the collections were
higher in the past. This was so despite the fact that people were routinely underestimating the

8
         The enabling law and draft regulations were set aside in September 2008 when a different form of property
tax was introduced as part of the new Tax Code in September 2008. However, a moratorium on the implementation
of the property parts of the 2008 Tax Code was subsequently declared in February 2009. Hence the proposal for the
regulations under the earlier property tax may still be considered in the future.

values of their property. Meanwhile, the Ministry of Finance argues that on the contrary, the
collections have actually improved. Collections of state duty over the last three years have
improved from KGS 215 million in 2005 to about KGS 400 million in 2007. The summary data
are as follows:

30.     Evolution of the Transaction Tax (State Duty): At project design, the transaction tax
rate was set at 7% of property value. At a later stage, it was reduced down to 5%. Afterwards,
the Government adopted a flat rate of KGS 1,000 per transaction. However, this did not survive
as was the case with the other arrangements. Finally, a differential rate structure was adopted in
October 2006 via Law No 733 and administration of the tax was brought under the State Duty
for Transactions (both movable and immovable). Currently, the property transaction tax is being
collected as a state duty following the provisions of the above stated Law.

31.     Analysis of Overall Fiscal Impact for LRERP: Below is an attempt to estimate the
fiscal impact of LRERP over 2001-2006. The fiscal returns consist of revenues generated by the
LROs, revenue generated through the State Duty on Transactions and avoided costs, which
consist of costs of operations of the LROs and self-financing for the Gosregister System. Total
fiscal revenues (direct and indirect) have almost tripled from 2001 to 2006. Meanwhile,
dependence of the system on public resources has been declining. In 2006, the Gosregister
system's fiscal impact was positive KGS 215 million with the State Duty, and negative KGS 14
million without the State Duty. The fiscal impact without the State Duty has been steadily
declining whilst the service levels have been increasing.

                            ANNEX 5. BENEFICIARY SURVEY RESULTS


The World Bank sponsored a consulting assignment to build capacity within the State Agency
for Registration of Rights to Immovable Property (Gosregister) and to measure performance in
terms of stakeholder feedback. The assignment consisted of initial capacity building for
Gosregister monitoring specialists and then `learning-by-doing' through conducting field work
involving a survey.

Capacity Building consisted of two formal seminars for monitoring specialists and one month of
mentored field work to identify stakeholder assessments of Gosregister performance. This work
yielded a set of survey instruments, reference material in the form of handouts and a manual for
conducting field work, and the emergence of 11 monitoring specialists with greatly enhanced
performance monitoring capability. With this increased capacity, it is recommended to broaden
the terms of reference for these monitors from the current practice of compiling numbers on
outputs to conducting more qualitative assessments, and institutionalizing their inputs into
determining overall Gosregister policies and procedures.

The primary component of performance monitoring was conducting a survey. Following
stakeholder meetings, four target groups were identified: regular clients (defined as those who
had used registration services in 2006), non-clients (who had no interaction with Gosregister
besides being covered by the systematic registration), professional organizations that work
regularly with Gosregister (including realtors, notaries, local governments), and Gosregister
staff. The following typology of areas for measurement was developed:

(i)     Service Provision Indicators (SPIs), which concern institutional performance, including
        levels of use or non-use of Gosregister's services, information dissemination, levels of
        access, and assessments of complexity and cost of using Gosregister services;

(ii)    Staff Professional Competence Indicators (PCIs), which concern subjective performance
        on substantive tasks, including accuracy of registration of data and speed of services; and

(iii)   Client Relations Indicators (CRIs), which concern subjective performance on interacting
        with clients, including issues of friendliness, convenience, fairness of service, and
        corruption.

The survey was conducted over a two week period in May-June 2007. It encompassed the 43
most active local registration offices (out of 50). Samples were:

9 549 were clients (50% of the sample),
9 198 (18%)were non-clients;
9 135 (12%) were representatives of various professional organizations providing services
    connected to the activities of Gosregister;
9 223 staff of Gosregister (20%).

In addition to the survey, Rural Development Fund (RDF) and Gosregister monitoring specialists
conducted focus group discussions, structured interviews, and observations of several local
registration offices' (LROs') operations.

                                                38

Key findings from the field work are:

General Evaluation

    1. Gosregister's services are generally evaluated as average, but its overall role is rated
         as valuable. 45% of clients gave Gosregister a `3' on a scale of 1 to 5, with most of the
         remainder either a `2' or a `4'. An `average' rating is probably to be expected in that
         Gosregister should provide routine processing services.10

    2. The value of Gosregister's mission to facilitate the property markets is largely
         recognized. There are high rates of understanding and use of Gosregister to secure
         ownership rights and utilize its services for credit.

    3. Human resources are seen to be by far the most important factor influencing quality
         of services. Nearly 2/3 of the responses noted issues related to staff operations
         (especially competence and ethics) as most important. Recommendations for
         improvements also focus on staff training, motivation (wage levels), and the need for
         greater accountability for mistakes in performance.

Service Provision Indicators

     1. Negligible use of Gosregister for lease rights (only 1.3% of client cases involved
          registration of a lease) suggests that need for guarantees of lessors' rights is not
          strong. It also is likely that tax avoidance influences this decision.

     2. Non-use of Gosregister service points to issues regarding the convenience of service
          to clients. A high proportion of non-clients cited fear of bureaucracy and complexity
          and lack of time and means as reasons for non-usage.

     3. Roughly half the surveyed clients are not aware of Gosregister's provision of
          information about all real estate and a third was unaware of a formal system of
          payment for faster processing. These are both items that Gosregister should broadcast
          more fully. In particular, the accessing of public property records is a basic ingredient to
          an efficient real estate market.

     4. Media and local governments play a large role in the public's understanding of
          Gosregister. Gosregister should use these channels as much as resources permit. In the
          case of local governments, at little cost it would be easy to provide copies of materials
          about the requirements for registration for public display. Local governments are key
          for providing information to rural areas.

     5. Gosregister can do more to provide information directly, including maintain phone
          lines and a better website.


10 Considering the very poor reputation of the two predecessor agencies (BTI and the Land Agency) prior to the
establishment of Gosregister, this basically positive finding is particularly remarkable.


                                                        39

    6. The level of physical access is quite good, with nearly 90% of clients having to spend
       under an hour to travel to their LRO.
    7. LROs should consider means to encourage more of a `one stop shop' for all that is
        required in registration. Even if other organizations are performing the service,
        organizing photocopying and banking services in close proximity to LROs should be
        possible.

    8. Only 1/3 of clients had difficulty with the registration process, and of these only
        about 40% had problems with Gosregister's procedures per se (other problems
        related to right-establishing documents or other agencies).

    9. Fees are considered mostly affordable and reasonable. 11% of clients and
        organizations thought that they were not affordable, with an additional 14% thinking
        that they were too high in conjunction with other organizations' fees. Only 25% thought
        that the amount of fees was not justified by the services provided. These figures are a
        comparatively low, especially for a county which has not had a long history in
        recovering costs of services through official fees.

Professional Competence Indicators

    10. A high proportion of representatives of associated organizations who are
        competent clients (58%) and Gosregister staff (77%) state that staff sometimes
        make mistakes with data entry.

    11. The most prevalent mistake is incorrect entry of names and addresses, which is not
        a question of professional skills, but attentiveness to detail.

    12. Gosregister staff generally feel skills are average and that additional training is
        needed.

    13. Measures are needed to increase accountability for Gosregister staff for their
        mistakes. The Guarantee Fund is not operational. Staff feel that they are measured in
        terms of timeliness rather than quality of data entry.

    14. There is widespread satisfaction (77% of clients) with the speed of services.

    15. Only about 5% of clients citing delays due to attempts to extract informal
        payments, though some professional associated organizations noted that they
        regularly provided such payments.

Client Relations Indicators

    16. More than 80% of clients and organization found that Gosregister staff behaved
        appropriately in carrying out their duties.

    17. Most clients provide average ratings for convenience of how LROs are organized.


                                              40

18. Convenience appears to depend on the individual effort of management, not
    standards. Gosregister should consider mandating basic standards, such as heating
    premises, size of print for information stands, and organizing other services nearby.

19. Gosregister is generally thought to be fair in its dealing with clients (2/3 of clients).

20. Assessments of corruption are largely inconclusive, though there is some
    corruption in the system. Only about 1/3 of clients and organizations thought that
    there was corruption, and only about half of these directly encountered it. About half of
    the respondents stated that they did not know, rather than confirm or deny that there is
    corruption. Some professional organizations cited making regular informal payments
    for services. This result indicates that Gosregister has a relatively good reputation in the
    specific context of the Kyrgyz Republic, where the perception of corruption within other
    government agencies is much higher.

21. When corruption occurs, it is to `facilitate' procedures rather than change
    decisions. Most cited instances of corruption were to speed up Gosregister's work and
    get help with other entities, while only 8% involved an effort to change the substance of
    what Gosregister was doing (i.e. alter areas, allow improper right-establishing
    documents).

22. Clients have little formal recourse to appeal adverse decisions made by Gosregister.

Introduction

        For years of independence in the Kyrgyz Republic as a result of privatization of
monopolistic state property a great number of private owners have developed, who own huge
capital, more than 2,5 million of immovable property units. Involving them in the economy is
one of the most efficient methods of overcoming poverty and developing economic growth in the
country.

        However, overly complicated procedures of execution of bargains with immovable
property and extremely incomplete and distributed at various bureaucratic offices immovable
property information database, inherited from the Soviet Union, hindered development of market
economy and complicated effective state management of country immovable property portfolio.
Lack of clearly developed and effectively operating mechanisms of rights guarantee to
immovable property made feel unconfident as new owners so as investors. In the issue objective
necessity in proper registration and protection of rights to immovable property, gathering
systematized and authentic information on immovable property for developing immovable
property market has emerged.

        With the aim to create conditions for protection and guarantee of rights to immovable
property State Agency on registration of rights to immovable property was founded in
Kyrgyzstan in 1999. This institute is responsible for introduction new system of immovable
property registration and its management. Gosregister is fundamentally new body in the system
of state management of the republic. It has been founded on the base of State agency on land
management, geodesy and mapping under the Government of the Kyrgyz Republic and urban
and rayon Bureau of technical inventory (BTI).

        Taking into account social and economic importance of creating effectively operating
system of state registration of rights to immovable property under modern market conditions, the
Government of the KR and World Bank signed an agreement on implementing a mutual
"Registration of Land and Immovable Property".

Aim of the Project

Main aim of the current Project is achieving and ensuring guaranteed protection of citizens and
legal persons to immovable property and creating conditions for dynamic development of
immovable property market, implementing over the entire territory of the KR effectively
operating system of state registration of rights to immovable property.

        For implementation this within the frame of the current Project concrete mechanisms,
procedures and technologies of unified system registration of rights to immovable property have
been developed which will ensure:

   · maximum simplification of registration of rights procedures to immovable property for
      natural and legal persons;

                                               43

   · ensuring guaranteed state protection of registered rights to immovable property;
   · preventing emerge of disputes and facilitating to solve disputes on immovable property;
   · creating reliable and constantly updated informational database on immovable property
      over Kyrgyzstan for providing authentic information state bodies and all legal persons and
      citizens;
   · development of civilized market of immovable property, including land;
   · conducting constant explanatory work on rights to immovable property and guarantees on
      their protection among population using extensively advertising funds;
   · determining taxed base for imposing tax on immovable property.

Pre-project situation

        As a result of economic reforms implemented in Kyrgyzstan number of private
immovable property has increased. Transition to market economy required more immovable
property to be involved in the economy. Along with this, information on immovable property
was incomplete and under control of several offices and organizations which had no interaction
and desire to coordinate their activities. That didn`t only hinder development of market
economy, for there were no unified office that could guarantee rights to immovable property, but
also complicated state and self-government management. In the result of reform, implemented
within the structure of executive branch urban and rayon Bureaus of Technical Stock-Taking,
within which core information on buildings was concentrated, were separated. Moreover they
had different branches of subordination (Gosarhstroy, Comhozes etc). Information on land was
at State Land Agency or rather at rayon and urban services of land management. Result of this
was procrastination at solving issues regarding rights to immovable property, rise in price
bargains execution of and sometimes deadlock because of narrow departmental interests of
offices which possessed relevant information.

        There were 90 offices over the republic to be unified. Within the frame of the Project it
was planned to found 50 registration offices with unified archives on building and land.

        Share of co-financing of the Project by the KR Government came to about 1.12 million
USD or 9% of the Project cost, including taxes of 1,6 million USD.

Project components

The Project consists of three components: institutional development, operation service, and
training.

1.      Institutional development:

       Institutional development of Kyrgyzstan registration system first of all concerned with
creating decentralized local registration offices over the entire territory of the KR. In accordance

                                                45

with step-by-step local registration offices opening approved by the Resolution of the Kyrgyz
Republic Government on August 14, 1999, 50 registration offices have been opened officially
and they are operating successfully implementing sporadic registration of rights to immovable
property.

        In accordance with agreements signed with managers of local state administrations
buildings for offices have been provided by local authorities without return. And building
repairing and providing with relevant equipment was funded by credit funds of the World Bank
and implemented by Gosregistr.

        Since opening of unified local offices execution of rights to land and immovable
property, registration, information output on rights and encumbrances have been implemented at
one office. Now there is no waste of time when serving clients and it is possible to solve all
issues regarding ownership to immovable property (including land) without procrastination.
Confidence to registration system has risen, various kinds of inquiries on registered rights and
encumbrances to immovable property that increase day by day is evidence of that fact. Number
of bargains with immovable property has increased greatly, including mortgage ones. Within the
frame of the Project it has been planned to register 200 000 rights in sporadic order. Gained
results exceed aimed plans four times and come to 805 000 of registered rights.

        The next aim of Gosregister is ensuring maximum access to information on immovable
property for participants of immovable property market and transparency of local registration
offices activity. This will enhance quality of provided service and create conditions for
elimination of corruption.

        In course of project realization in 27 local offices ARS have been implemented. Using
ASR terms of registration have been greatly reduced and procedure of documents reception has
been simplified.

        Implementing ARS not only facilitates efficient information output of various kind but it
is also first step to creating Land Information System on immovable property over the country.

        Currently all offices of Gosregister execute their activity on principles of self-financing
and self-repayment.

        At the same time cost of service to registration of rights does not exceed one USD for
natural persons and two USD for legal ones independently of size and kind of real property unit.

2.      Operational service

        Operational service of the Project includes implementing system registration, preparing
registration maps, conducting advertising campaign.

        System registration of rights to immovable property is the most expensive and laborious
part of the component 2. The aim of implementation system registration was creating conditions
for protection and guarantee of rights to real property of poor population sectors who has no
funds to pay for registration service, in some cases they have no legal documents and sometimes
they do not understand necessity of rights registration.

                                                46

        Within the frame of the Project tender for firms and specialists of system groups has been
executed and they implemented system inspection of real property units and preparing
documents to state registration of rights to real property. Selected specialists were trained at
training centers, certified and provided with special uniform and identity card.

      Providing with applications of registration documents, copies of registration cards, archive
furniture, office equipment and its employing in the course of system registration have been
implemented at the expense of Project funds.
        System registration of rights to real property in human settlements was launched at the
end of 2000 in Issyk-Ata, Kara-Suu rayons and in Bishkek. Subsequently after official openings
of registration offices, system registration was implemented in accordance with plan at all
registration offices. At each registration area workshops were conducted ­ launch with
participation of local administration workers, state structures, community representatives, and
each village there were meetings for informing and explanation essence of system registration to
population. Implementing those activities facilitated successful cooperation of all institutes and
organizations which had information on real property; right holders became interested in
provision relevant documents for registration that expedited process of system inspection.

        System registration in human settlements was implemented in 2006; in the result of it
rights to 1 million 300 thousands of IPU have been registered. Besides, archive and electronic
database on all real property in towns and villages has been created.

        The following is information on paces of system registration for period 2000 ­ 2006

        All the information on rights and real property itself has been entered in electronic
database. Currently information on all immovable property units is concentrated at registration
offices and constantly updated. This unique database lets create taxable database on all real
property.



                                                47

        The second stage was implementing system registration of land shares. Land reform was
implemented in speeded paces and often by specialists who had no special topographic and legal
knowledge. Thus, gathering of initial information on land share owners required more time and
human resources. Moreover, Kyrgyzstan which is agrarian country, plough-land is only capital
for rural population and any mistake or unfairness during registration of rights to land shares
could result social explosion. Owing to close cooperation of PIU specialists, local registration
offices and ayil-okmotu this work has been implemented successfully.

        The following is the information on course of implementing registration of rights to land
shares:




                January 1       January 1       January 1       January 1

        According to Credit agreement according to results of project realization it was necessary
to register 600000 rights to immovable property. It was supposed by the Project budget that
costs for inspection will come to 9 USD. According to project results costs for inspection and
registration of rights to immovable property unit came to 3 USD and following results have been
achieved:

   Type of registration        Planned                 Implemented          Comments

                                                                            The plan has been over-
   System registration                  600 000        2 706 239            fulfilled 3,5 times


One of the key aspects of implementing system registration is public informing (familiarization)
of system inspection results. In the course of public informing familiarization of community
with lists of right holders has been implemented. All those who were interested could check-up
if an owner had been determined correctly or information on encumbrances and limitations had
been authentic. Lists of right holders during the determined terms were displayed at public
places where specialists fixed all complaints and desires of owners and right holders who got
acquainted with lists.

The systematic registration component had a wide social orientation. During the
systematic registration not only free state registration of owner's and IPU user rights was
performed, resulting in 270 mln. som savings, but also rights to those property units
lacking right-establishing documents were legalized (regularized).

Cumulative Regularization of rights to immovable property during the systematic
registration:


   700000                                                                   661890

   500000

   400000

   300000

   200000

   100000           12400

            0

                   2000                   2001-2006                       2007

Besides, more than 2.5 thousand persons were employed with fixed salaries and for a
certain period of time as local consultants (specialist) to fulfill the systematic registration.

      Preparation of registration maps has become one of the most complicated issues
of the systematic registration given the lack of baseline maps in scale 1:2000.

      For settlement areas only 65 % of such maps were available. In order to deal with
this situation, in settlement areas lacking map data, adequate cadastral maps were
produced by scanning maps of scale 1:10000, by maximizing images till required scale
and by digitalizing them.

      Besides, for the cities of Bishkek and Osh, aerial material produced under the Swiss
programme and available at Goscartographia, were used for production of cadastral maps
for settlement areas by cameral deciphering of photographs. As a result of this
cooperation, using credit funds, digital maps for the cities and Osh were produced. At
present, all electronic mapping information is up-to-date as all changes and new IPU
boundaries were drawn on them during the sporadic registration of rights.

      Public awareness and advertisement
      One of the factors that contributed to the success of the Project was the initiation of
the public awareness campaign. Within the framework of the Project, in each registration



                                            53

zone a number of meeting with local government representatives, judges, notaries, state
architecture control specialists, communities were conducted in order to explain to the
citizens and legal persons their rights to immovable property in both sporadic and
systematic order, a number of local newspapers were issued with articles explaining the
essence of the state registration of rights, aims and procedures of systematic registration,
audio and video trailers were launched on Republican and local radio and television.
During the systematic registration nearly 1000 rural gatherings were arranged where
apart from the explanation, newsletters and special editions were disseminated among
communities.

3.      Training

        Preparation of qualified personnel for state registration of rights to immovable
property is one of the main tasks of the Project. Given the fact, that all workers
previously working at BTI and land administration system, know little about the new
registration system and methods of its implementation, the Project has re-trained all the
workers without exception. In addition, a number of seminars were conducted
concerning registration aimed at successful cooperation between concerned institutions
and interacting organizations.

        Training Centers
        For training purposes and for raising qualification of Gosregister employees,
constantly functioning training centers were opened in the cities of Kant and Osh. World
Bank credit funds were also used to equip these auditoriums with computers, overhead
projectors and other training equipment.

        Leaders of these training centers and chairpersons were selected on competitive
basis and are being paid from Project funds. In 2003 the Osh training center was
transferred to the Osh Registration Office of Gosregister and in 2004 the Kant training
center was moved to Bishkek. All office equipment was given to the Gosregister.

        A training plan for every category of trainees has been developed and agreed upon
with the plan of gradual opening of local registration offices across the territory of the
Kyrgyz Republic.

Training of Gosregister specialists and the personnel in systematic registration was
performed by Gosregister, PIU and invited lecturers.

Project monitoring

        Gosregister apparatus and the PIU during the whole period of Project
implementation have performed regular monitoring and analysis of formation,
development and operation of the registration system with consideration on Project's
main performance indicators.

        For this purpose, a team of specialists on monitoring was selected: national and
regional monitoring coordinators.

        Local registration offices submit monthly report on performed works, reflecting
the number of registered rights and encumbrances, number of secondary transactions,
number of mortgages, number of property units covered by systematic registration,
number of disputable situations, number of complaints to local registration offices,
number of legalized registration rights during the systematic registration.

        Regional specialists on monitoring have taken control over the quality and
timeliness of services provided during sporadic registration. In doing so, a major
attention was paid to transparency on registration and pricing. For this purpose,
information stands were established in reception and delivery halls, help-lines and
complaint boxes were also established at reception and delivery halls. All information
about the work of registration offices with customers was analyzed by regional specialists
on monitoring and was submitted to PIU and Gosregister management.

        During the process of monitoring of the systematic registration, regional
specialists have not only controlled the quality and the speed of works on systematic
registration, but they have also organized meetings and gatherings with communities,
villagers and local government employees. Regional specialists on monitoring also



                                           56

coordinated interaction between local registration offices, local government and city
administrations. This very fact served as the key to the success of the systematic
registration of land shares.


Financial management

PIU Financial Group responsible for Project's financial management, payments, book-
keeping and financial reporting and internal control, was directly involved in recording of
expenses of the PIU.

The PIU has purchased on centralized basis vehicles, equipment, furniture, materials for
the PIU, Gosregister, regional offices and Training centers and uniforms for systematic
registrars.

Distribution of goods to registration offices and training centers was made according to
Gosregister's order by acceptance acts.

PIU Financial Manager was coordinating the work of the accountants of local registration
offices with the regard to expenditures by the Project, and recorded main funds and
materials.

The PIU has trained accountants of registration offices in procedures for keeping record
of Project expenses and produced special forms to be used by registration offices in their
reports to PIU. The audit of Project's financial activities was conducted annually.

International auditor was purchased through bidding process. The cost for audit was
financed from credit funds.

In addition, each year the Parliament of the Kyrgyz Republic's Audit Chamber was
checking our financial activities, resulting in no objection on their part.

Social and economic benefit of the Project

        Successful Project implementation that resulted in efficiently functioning system
of state registration of rights to immovable property has significant social and economic
benefit.

        Systematic registration of rights to immovable property has made it possible to
provide an absolutely free state guarantee and security of rights to immovable property
for poor groups of population. Moreover, property owners, whose rights were not
registered in an established order, acquired their right-establishing documents through the
procedure which was made as easy as possible for them during the systematic
registration. This has created an opportunity for many to use property as starting capital,
to get mortgages, thus overcoming the poverty.

Dynamics of mortgages over the country between 2002 and 2007




       Mortgage operation of the property market increase each year and during the
period between 2002 ­ 2007 was increased in average by 20% .
       Mortgages in mln. USD

                                             Table 6




       Not only the registration procedure itself was considerably simplified but the
procedure of getting credible information about the rights and encumbrances was
simplified as well. The electronic property data base, developed within the framework of
the Project, and consisting of more than 2,5 mln. property units, helps state authorities



                                          58

and local self-governments to effectively manage land resource. This data base serves as
the base for formation of the fiscal cadastre.

        Successful completion of the Project "Registration of Land and Real Estate" is the
result of efficient joint activity between the World Bank, Swedesurvey, Gosregister and
the Ministry of Finances of the Kyrgyz Republic. High professionalism of the World
Bank team, understanding of political and economic situation in Kyrgyzstan, competence
of Swedesurvey international consultants in solution of questions concerning the choice
of the model for registration system, timely consultancy support, effective solution of
financial problems and consideration of presented documents, the work of the Ministry of
Finance concerning co-financing allowed the Gosregister team not only to fulfill all the
requirement of the credit agreement, but even to over-perform them by several times.
