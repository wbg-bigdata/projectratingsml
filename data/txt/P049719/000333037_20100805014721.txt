               IEGWB Mission: Improving development results through excellence in evaluation.


About this Report
       The Independent Evaluation Group assesses the programs and activities of the World Bank for two purposes:
first, to ensure the integrity of the Bank's self-evaluation process and to verify that the Bank's work is producing the
expected results, and second, to help develop improved directions, policies, and procedures through the
dissemination of lessons drawn from experience. As part of this work, IEGWB annually assesses about 25 percent of
the Bank's lending operations through field work. In selecting operations for assessment, preference is given to those
that are innovative, large, or complex; those that are relevant to upcoming studies or country evaluations; those for
which Executive Directors or Bank management have requested assessments; and those that are likely to generate
important lessons.
       To prepare a Project Performance Assessment Report (PPAR), IEGWB staff examine project files and other
documents, interview operational staff, visit the borrowing country to discuss the operation with the government,
and other in-country stakeholders, and interview Bank staff and other donor agency staff both at headquarters and
in local offices as appropriate.
     Each PPAR is subject to internal IEGWB peer review, Panel review, and management approval. Once cleared
internally, the PPAR is commented on by the responsible Bank department. IEGWB incorporates the comments as
relevant. The completed PPAR is then sent to the borrower for review; the borrowers' comments are attached to
the document that is sent to the Bank's Board of Executive Directors. After an assessment report has been sent to
the Board, it is disclosed to the public.

About the IEGWB Rating System
     IEGWB's use of multiple evaluation methods offers both rigor and a necessary level of flexibility to adapt to
lending instrument, project design, or sectoral approach. IEGWB evaluators all apply the same basic method to
arrive at their project ratings. Following is the definition and rating scale used for each evaluation criterion
(additional information is available on the IEGWB website: http://worldbank.org/ieg).
     Outcome: The extent to which the operation's major relevant objectives were achieved, or are expected to
be achieved, efficiently. The rating has three dimensions: relevance, efficacy, and efficiency. Relevance includes
relevance of objectives and relevance of design. Relevance of objectives is the extent to which the project's
objectives are consistent with the country's current development priorities and with current Bank country and
sectoral assistance strategies and corporate goals (expressed in Poverty Reduction Strategy Papers, Country
Assistance Strategies, Sector Strategy Papers, Operational Policies). Relevance of design is the extent to which
the project's design is consistent with the stated objectives. Efficacy is the extent to which the project's objectives
were achieved, or are expected to be achieved, taking into account their relative importance. Efficiency is the
extent to which the project achieved, or is expected to achieve, a return higher than the opportunity cost of capital
and benefits at least cost compared to alternatives. The efficiency dimension generally is not applied to adjustment
operations. Possible ratings for Outcome: Highly Satisfactory, Satisfactory, Moderately Satisfactory, Moderately
Unsatisfactory, Unsatisfactory, Highly Unsatisfactory.
     Risk to Development Outcome: The risk, at the time of evaluation, that development outcomes (or
expected outcomes) will not be maintained (or realized). Possible ratings for Risk to Development Outcome: High
Significant, Moderate, Negligible to Low, Not Evaluable.
     Bank Performance: The extent to which services provided by the Bank ensured quality at entry of the
operation and supported effective implementation through appropriate supervision (including ensuring adequate
transition arrangements for regular operation of supported activities after loan/credit closing, toward the
achievement of development outcomes. The rating has two dimensions: quality at entry and quality of supervision.
Possible ratings for Bank Performance: Highly Satisfactory, Satisfactory, Moderately Satisfactory, Moderately
Unsatisfactory, Unsatisfactory, Highly Unsatisfactory.
     Borrower Performance: The extent to which the borrower (including the government and implementing
agency or agencies) ensured quality of preparation and implementation, and complied with covenants and
agreements, toward the achievement of development outcomes. The rating has two dimensions: government
performance and implementing agency(ies) performance. Possible ratings for Borrower Performance: Highly
Satisfactory, Satisfactory, Moderately Satisfactory, Moderately Unsatisfactory, Unsatisfactory, Highly
Unsatisfactory.

Preface
This is the Project Performance Assessment Report (PPAR) of the Land and Real Estate
Registration Project (LRERP) in the Kyrgyz Republic. The LRERP was approved on June 6,
2000 and received an IDA Credit (Credit 3370) of $9.4 million equivalent, which was fully
disbursed by project closure on December 31, 2008. There were two project extensions,
amounting to three years in all. The first extension (two years) was approved in December
2004, and was to enable implementation of a larger registration program for agricultural
lands. The second extension, of one year, was approved in November 2007 to allow for
financial bridging between LRERP and a follow-on registration project.

The report presents IEG findings based on review of the projects' implementation completion
reports, appraisal reports, legal documents, sector reports, and other relevant material; and a
mission to Kyrgyz in December 2009. The mission visited project sites, and held discussions
with government officials and agencies, project directors and staff, beneficiaries, the private
sector, key donors and NGOs.

The LRERP was chosen for assessment because, first, it illustrates how a land administration
program was successfully developed without significant prior experience or institutional
capacity. The features that enabled Kyrgyz, a relatively low-income country for the Europe
and Central Asia (ECA) Region, to be generally successful are of interest elsewhere. Second,
the institutional structure chosen for the project was to have a single agency implementing
cadastral and registration activities together. Kyrgyz's experience can be compared with
those of other countries with more complicated arrangements involving dual or multiple
agencies. And third, Kyrgyz developed particularly streamlined land administration
processes which could be emulated elsewhere. This PPAR is undertaken as part of a series of
PPARs of several similar land administration projects in the Europe and Central Asia Region.

Following standard IEG procedures, copies of the draft Project Performance Assessment
Report were sent to Government officials for their review and comments. Their comments
were taken into account and included in Appendix D.

Summary
This Project Performance Assessment Report reviews the experience and lessons of the Land
and Real Estate Registration Project in the Kyrgyz Republic.

The objective of the Land and Real Estate Registration Project was to "support development
of markets for land and real estate through the introduction of a reliable and well
functioning land and real estate registration system." This was highly relevant to the
Government's and the World Bank's development strategy for the Kyrgyz Republic of
market-based economic growth. GDP was growing at about four percent per annum, which
was insufficient to make significant inroads on the country's low per capita income of $490 ­
only one tenth of average per capita income in Europe and Central Asia. As a basic factor of
production, land-related infrastructure needed to be securely owned and readily tradable
through an efficient market facilitated by efficient land administration services.

Yet, this was far from the case when the project was conceived: land ownership records were
inaccurate or nonexistent; land registration responsibilities were fragmented across a number
of agencies with minimal communication between them; a legislative base for land
administration was lacking; and trained land administration professionals were scarce.
Inadequate documentation of land ownership discouraged potential land purchasers, and
banks were reluctant to lend against land collateral without clearly recorded land ownership.
Partly as a result of these factors, land transactions were infrequent, productivity enhancing
investment on the land was constrained, and the mortgage market was minimal compared to
its potential.

The project's straightforward design was a good reflection of its objective. The components
covered creation of a nation-wide land registration service; passing supporting legislation and
regulations; a cadastral program to progressively map and confirm ownership of land and
other real property; the building-up of a registration system for recording property-based
transactions such as sales and mortgages; information technology systems; and a major
training program. A particularly noteworthy action was to create only one institution ­
Gosregister­ for handling all land administration activities. Under this single agency,
coordination activities proved easier than under the dual-agency approach utilized in a
number of countries where cadastre and registration are under separate institutions.

The limited scope of the monitoring and evaluation (M&E) program was the project's main
operational weakness. M&E was strong as concerns management information system-type
data which became a useful tool for Gosregister. But there was no M&E of broader economic
and social impacts. Aside from this weakness, however, project performance was strong, and
all project targets were achieved or exceeded. Amongst the achievements, a nation-wide
network of 50 registration offices was established and all staff were trained. The number of
properties registered under the cadastre program reached 2.7 million, significantly more than
the 0.6 million properties planned. (Under this expanded program, rural areas were included,
whereas at appraisal, the decision was to concentrate on urban areas.). Progress was also
made towards financial self-sufficiency: about 40 of the 50 registration offices now cover
salaries and other operating costs. A particularly noteworthy achievement is the improvement
in registration efficiency ­ procedures for registering a land transaction have been simplified,
                                             x


costs trimmed, and the time required to register a transaction reduced from weeks or months
prior to the project to 5 days currently. The efficiency of the Kyrgyz Republic's land
registration system is now rated 19th out of 183 countries in the Bank's Doing Business 2010
report.

The land market grew hugely. The value of annual property sales increased from $120
million in 2002 to $1.5 billion in 2007, and the annual value of new mortgages increased
from less than $100 million in 2002 to $1.3 billion in 2008. Macro-variables such as the
general influence of GDP growth will likely have been the main drivers of the growth in the
land market, but the improving registration service likely played a facilitating role. The
project's small cost of $11 million helped leverage major land market growth.

Social issues could have received greater attention. It was assumed during project preparation
and implementation that, as Gosregister provided women and poorer families with the same
rights to the land administration service as other clients, the service would inevitably benefit
them. The M&E program did not assess such issues, hence without data this contention
cannot be empirically assessed (although one of Gosregister's surveys found that women had
more difficulty accessing land administration services than other social groups). However,
experience in a number of countries, including in the Europe and Central Asia Region, is that
measures to include marginal groups may need to be specifically provided for in a land
administration project's design.

The performance of both the Bank and the borrower was satisfactory. The Bank designed a
project well suited to conditions in the Kyrgyz Republic following good practice in the
choice of a single agency and the design of other project features. The supervision team's
hands-on guidance helped Gosregister to establish itself and to acquire the skills needed for a
modern land administration service. Government provided strong political support, facilitated
coordination with local governments and other parties, created Gosregister before project
implementation, and passed all legislation needed. On the downside, counterpart funds were
insufficient during the project's first two years. Gosregister's performance was exemplary.

The Land Reform and Real Estate Registration Project's outcome was highly satisfactory
overall. The project's relevance was substantial ­ a liberalized land market would contribute
to the country's market-based growth strategy, and project design was well suited to promote
this. The project achieved or exceeded its output targets and helped facilitate a major growth
in the land market. Both efficacy and efficiency were high. (The somewhat lower rating for
relevance is because social issues were not considered and M&E was limited to management
information.) However, recent socio-political events have introduced uncertainties regarding
the degree of future government support to Gosregister, and the risks to its development
outcome are best rated significant at this time.

Results can, however, be articulated in the broader perspective of what the project has
achieved overall. From a situation where modern land administration was virtually absent, an
institution was established, staff were trained, and legislation passed. An ambitious program
of activities largely new to the Kyrgyz Republic was successfully implemented, and
operational efficiency levels were reached comparable to the world's best performing
                                           xi


countries. The lessons below include the "good practice" features that have helped the Land
Reform and Real Estate Registration Project to succeed:

   ·   The project's success can be attributed in part to several good-practice design
       features: (a) use of a single agency combining all land administration activities; (b)
       establishing this institution and supporting legislation before project commencement;
       (c) prioritizing, with a major training program, the development of a cadre of
       professional staff; and (d) introducing complex activities such as digitization in
       phases corresponding with evolving management and technical capacity.

   ·   Continuous monitoring of service indicators and flexibility to adjust registration
       procedures as experience is gained can significantly enhance service efficiency. By
       rigorous monitoring of its efficiency, and cutting procedures and the involvement of
       other parties that were not needed, Gosregister significantly reduced the time, costs
       and complexity of its registration services.

   ·   With efficient operations and institutional arrangements, a land administration service
       can be financially autonomous. Experience from other countries is that achieving
       financial independence is often difficult. Yet most of Gosregister's land registration
       offices are financially independent despite the low fees charged to clients.
       Gosregister's relative success is because the land registration offices are state
       enterprises, which can earn, retain and spend revenues independent of government;
       and also because, the single agency system streamlines operations and means that
       each office can cross-subsidize cadastre with the higher revenues from its registration
       activities.

   ·   The social aspects of land administration projects need to be considered at the design
       stage and built into project design. Social impacts need to be monitored, with
       flexibility to adapt the project in response to implementation experience. This was
       overlooked by the project. Consequently, there is little knowledge of the land
       administration program's effect on vulnerable groups such as women and poorer
       households, and how the welfare of these groups might be protected or improved.

1. Development and land market issues in the Kyrgyz
Republic
1.1    Accelerating the Kyrgyz Republic's pro-poor economic growth is considered
by both Government and the Bank to be the country's highest development priority.
The Kyrgyz Republic is a low-income country with a population of about 5.3 million
and a per capita gross national income estimated in 2008 to be about $790 per capita ­
one tenth of average per capita income in Europe and Central Asia. Since the mid
1990s, after the first shock from withdrawal from the Soviet block, economic growth
has averaged about 4.4 percent per year (1998-2008), increasing to about 8 percent per
annum in 2007 and 2008.1

1.2     The Kyrgyz Republic is landlocked, making communications and trade more
difficult, and has a quite limited resource base. Gold and hydropower are the two main
non-agricultural resources and reserves of the former are reported to be diminishing. In
the absence of significant industrial activity, agriculture has been a mainstay of the
economy. However, the rural environment is not favorable to agriculture: Kyrgyz's
mountainous terrain leaves only about seven percent of land area well suited for
farming, and the country's geographic isolation adds costs to export prospects.
Nevertheless, agriculture still contributes nearly a third of GDP, but its growth rate ­
some 2.5 percent per annum in the 1998-2008 period - is not enough to provide the
development engine that the country sorely requires. Rapid development of industry
and commerce, as well as an upturn in agricultural performance, are needed.
Accelerated economic growth will require transition from an economy constrained by
an unwieldy public sector and regulatory system to a market economy spurred by good
governance and an improved business environment. This has been a consistent
strategic objective for the Kyrgyz Republic throughout the last decade.

1.3      The 1998 Country Assistance Strategy directly preceding the Land and Real
Estate Registration Project (LRERP), while primarily focused on economic growth,
also emphasized better governance, development of the rural sector, and poverty
alleviation. Government's Country Development Strategy for 2007-2010 had four
pillars: growth-oriented economic policies; improving the business environment; better
governance; and more transparent public administration. A liberalized land market was
a core part of this strategic framework.

1.4     LRERP's overall aim to introduce an effective land administration system and
thereby support development of a well functioning land and property market was a
central element of the country's market-based development strategy. As a basic factor
of production, land needed to be efficiently used. Security of tenure and reliable market
mechanisms to sell and buy land with low transaction costs were needed if land was to
be an underpinning for economic growth. Security of tenure was also important to
social welfare ­ owners could rely on their land as a secure asset and means of

livelihood. Guaranteed ownership and a functioning land market reduce the risk of loss
of property, thereby stimulating land transfer to higher productivity use, greater
investment, development of the mortgage market, and increased liquidity in financial
markets. This chain of influences was a reasonable assumption given experience in a
number of other countries and from empirical studies,2 and has been the implicit
reasoning behind the support for land reform in Kyrgyz contained in both the Bank's
and Government's strategy documents.3

1.5      Achieving a liberalized land market would not be easy. At independence from
the Soviet Union in 1990, land in the Kyrgyz Republic was owned by the state and
agricultural land was formed into collective or state farms. There had, therefore, been
little need for registration of properties, and a land market was virtually non-existent.
The government progressively adjusted this situation through a land reform program
distributing land to former members of the collectives. By 2000, when the LRERP was
approved, land reforms were nearly complete and privatization of the remaining
collectives was being assisted by the Agricultural Support Services Project (FY98,
project period 1998-2008, Credit of $15.0 million). However, an effective land
administration service was still not present. Documented property ownership was
confused and inaccurate, and in the hands of a number of agencies, including the
Bureau of Technical Inventory, city and regional architect's offices, the State Property
Fund, the State Cartographic Agency, and others. Lack of coordination, land legislation
and institutional capacity constrained any development of a modern land
administration system, and a land market had still hardly commenced. From comments
made to the IEG mission by Government and property owners, registering a transaction
could take months and the eventual document could not be relied upon to accurately
depict boundaries or even the legal status of ownership. Also, there were widespread
perceptions amongst landowners, based on their experience of the Soviet period and
first years after the Soviet period, that the land was not theirs and might be taken back
at any time. This situation was further complicated due to Government's moratorium
on the sale of agricultural land intended to protect rural dwellers from land speculators.

Republic of Kyrgyz (2007 ­ 2010) (World Bank, and other development partners 2007) which stated that
the LRERP "has been successful in increasing land tenure security, improving access to investment
capital and more efficient use of land and real estate assets, stemming from an efficient system for land
and real estate transactions;" and (iii) Kyrgyz's Country Development Strategy for 2007 ­ 2010
(Republic of Kyrgyz 2007) which commented that a reliable and well functioning land registration
system remained a key Government priority.

2. Objectives and Implementation
Development Objective
2.1      According to the Development Credit Agreement, the Kyrgyz Republic's Land
and Real Estate Registration Project's (LRERP) Development Objective was to:
Support development of markets for land and real estate through the introduction of
a reliable and well functioning land and real estate registration system. The Project
Appraisal Document adds a comment that the project would support "more intensive
and effective use of land and real estate" However, this statement is not reflected in the
text of the PAD including in sections where reference might particularly be expected
such as the Results Framework (page 25).4 Instead, the PAD's discussion of project
outputs and outcome is restricted to LRERP's impact on the land market. The intent of
the project is thus best defined by the Credit Agreement's statement of LRERP's
development objective, and this will be used in the PPAR. Nevertheless, reference to
productivity will be made where useful to the discussion of the project's outcome.
Reference will also be made to poverty impacts and the rural sector, in line with the
Bank's and Government's overall development goal of economic growth including a
pro-poor and rural sector orientation (Section 1).

Design
2.2     The Kyrgyz LRERP had three components supporting this objective (Box 1).
The first component financed all activities needed to create an operating nation-wide
registration service, including management capacity and monitoring and evaluation
(M&E), establishing and equipping offices, and passing necessary legislation and
regulations. The second component financed the registration program itself. The third
component financed a major training program for Gosregister, the agency created to
implement the project.5 The original design anticipated dealing only with the
registration of urban properties, although registration in rural areas was added in 2004.
A notable feature of the design was the emphasis on institutional development ­ the
dominant focus of the first and last project components was to this effect.

the Project (page 9), Project Rationale (page 12), and the Detailed Project Description (Annex 2).

interchangeably in this report. All of these terms mean the land and all immovable assets (house,
warehouse, fixed equipment, and others) on the land.

    Box 1: Objectives and Components of the Kyrgyz Land and Real Estate Registration Project

Development Objective: To support development of markets for land and real estate through the
introduction of a reliable and well functioning land and real estate registration system.

Components:

Component A ­ Institutional Development: Establishment of a national level unified real estate
registration system and improvement in real property transaction procedures, including: establishing a
Project Implementation Unit within Gosregister to create management capacity for coordinating and
monitoring a nation-wide real estate registration system; setting up registration offices throughout the
country; implementing "sporadic registration" from these offices; creating a legislative, regulatory and
procedural framework for operation of the registry offices; coordination with government agencies,
notaries and other real estate professionals to implement effective transaction processes; and
coordinating with government the establishment of a fiscal cadastre. (Cost estimate at appraisal: $6.0
million; actual costs at completion: $3.9 million.)6

Component B ­ Operational Services: Provision of data to the registration offices, primarily through a
"systematic registration" program, including: a public awareness program of land registration activities
and benefits for government departments, land related civil society such as notaries, and the general
public; collecting available land data from existing sporadic sources; and conducting a systematic
adjudication program on an area-by-area basis. (Cost estimate at appraisal: $4.8 million; actual costs:
$6.9 million.)

Component C ­ Training: Training of Gosregister staff, contracted personnel involved with systematic
registration, and professional organizations connected with the real estate market, including:
establishment of training centers for in-service training; and, establishing a long-term program to raise
professional skills of Gosregister staff and of civil society professionals involved with the land market.
(Cost estimate at appraisal - $0.3 million; actual costs $0.2 million.)
Sources: Development Objective from the Development Credit Agreement; components and costs from the Project
Appraisal Document and the Implementation Completion and Results Report.


Institutional arrangements
2.3     A new land agency ­ The "State Agency for The Registration of Rights in
Immovable Property," commonly referred to as "Gosregister" ­ was established during
project preparation. It was arranged that Gosregister would handle all aspects of land
registration and cadastre together ­ i.e., the "single agency" model that is generally
considered the most suitable for land administration, as coordination of activities is
simpler. A project implementation unit (PIU) was established within Gosregister and
staffed with well-qualified professionals.

  For institutional development costs the Ministry of Finance in its letter of June 25, 2010 (attached at
the end of this report) has commented on a discrepancy between the estimated project costs of US$ 3.9
million in the PPAR (using the figures in the ICR) and the Ministry of Finance figure for institutional
costs of US$ 3.5 million. A possible explanation for the difference is the depreciation against the dollar
of the Kyrgyz Som. The exchange rate at end 2008 was 39.4 Som per US dollar, whereas in May 2010 it
was 45.8 Som per US dollar. This adjustment of 16 percent would be sufficient to explain the difference
between the costs in US dollars estimated at project closure and current cost estimates in US dollars.

Implementation
2.4     The LRERP was approved by the World Bank's Board in June 2000, and was
closed 8½ years later in December 2008. The $9.4 million IDA Credit was fully
disbursed by project closure. In the second year of the project IDA funding for civil
works and operating expenses was increased to 100 percent in response to
Government's difficulties providing counterpart funds. At project appraisal only urban
areas had been envisaged for the program, but by mid-project the scope for urban
registration was diminishing while Gosregister's registration capacity had become
greater than expected. Government and the Bank agreed to develop a rural program,
which became the project's major cadastral activity, and the project period was
extended by two years. There were no co-financers but the project interacted
informally with a number of other agencies providing mutual support to the land
sector. The Swedish development agency (Sida) implemented a parallel but
coordinated training program supplementing the LRERP training program, USAID
projects promoted land reform and privatization of urban property, and a legal
assistance program for rural communities was financed under Swiss cooperation. There
were two project extensions, amounting to three years. The first extension (two years)
was approved in December 2004, to enable implementation of a much larger program
for systematic registration including agricultural lands. The second extension, of one
year, was approved in November 2007 to allow for financial bridging to the follow-on
Second Land and Real Estate Registration Project. No environmental or fiduciary
safeguard issues have been reported.7

2.5    LRERP reached or exceeded its physical targets, as shown in Table 1 below,
which compares achievements against the project's monitorable indicators.




7. LRERP was classified as a Category C project (minor or no environmental impacts) for which an
Environmental Assessment is not required. Supervision documents indicate that Gosregister's financial
management included full recording of transactions, regular and timely financial statements, and
adequate internal control systems and that auditing was regular and encountered no major issues.

RELEVANCE

Relevance of Objectives

3.2      LRERP was a natural fit within the Kyrgyz Government's and the Bank's
development strategy. As discussed in Section 1, market-based economic growth has
been the primary goal throughout the LRERP project period (2000-2008).8 Improving
governance and the business environment are highlighted as essential supporting
pillars, and economic growth that is also pro-poor is particularly favored. Thus, in the
Joint Country Support Strategy for Kyrgyz (2007-2010), the Bank and other lending
partners emphasized "Economic management consistent with strong and sustained pro-
poor growth." Within such a strategy a facilitating land administration system has been
recognized as a basic need for developing an efficient market economy. As articulated
in the 1998 Country Assistance Strategy, the Bank strategy document at the time of
project preparation, "The land registration project would help create functioning land
markets in both rural and urban areas."

3.3      LRERP's relevance was accentuated by the dysfunctional state of land
administration that it had to confront. The land sector was very far from a free market.
There were a number of government agencies involved with land registration, and land
management, to the extent that there was any, was fragmented with minimal
communication between the agencies. There was no legislative framework.
Institutional capacity was low. Modern land administration processes were absent.


8. Refer to: (i) Kyrgyz Country Assistance Strategy (World Bank, April, 1998); (ii) the Joint Country
Support Strategy for the Republic of Kyrgyz (2007 ­ 2010) (World Bank, and other development
partners, May, 2007); and (iii) Kyrgyz's Country Development Strategy for 2007 ­ 2010 (Republic of
Kyrgyz, 2007).
                                                      8


Land transactions were scarce and prices low, partly because of concerns about
ownership,9 and the mortgage market was minimal compared to potential.

3.4     The relevance of LRERP's objectives is somewhat qualified by the limited
focus of its stated objective, which was exclusively to develop the land market. There
are advantages of having a narrowly targeted objective for a land administration project
as design and implementation become more straightforward. But there are
disadvantages - the impact of land on economic growth is not only based on the land
market. With security of tenure, greater incentives are provided to invest on the land.
Increased productivity of land can, thus, occur without involving any market
transactions. A broader objective, to include higher investment and productivity, would
have encompassed the larger economic benefits attainable through a land
administration project. To an extent, this wider perspective was expressed in the PAD's
addition to LRERP's objective stating that the project would support "more intensive
and effective use of land and real estate". But, as discussed in para 2.2, this statement
was not reflected in LRERP's Results Framework, indicating that this was not the
actual intent of the project. Recognition of social impacts and opportunities would also
have been desirable. LRERP's objectives did not specifically state a pro-poor
orientation, which is inconsistent with Kyrgyz's development strategy of pro-poor
economic growth.10 Benefits for vulnerable groups such as the poor, elderly and
women might have been greater if specific pro-poor features had been built into project
design.11 Also, the relative priorities of urban and rural registration (the project initially
focused on urban registration) could have been more explicitly articulated in the
PAD.12 Taking account of LRERP's highly relevant core objective to develop the land

9. Improved perceptions by themselves are expected to raise willingness to invest on the land and
interest in buying land. Sources of insecurity in urban areas are not documented.
10. Security of tenure may have been particularly beneficial for vulnerable groups such as the poor,
elderly and women. However, while probable in at least the majority of cases, there is no empirical
evidence in Kyrgyz to confirm this or to assess situations where some social groups are at risk as a result
of cadastral and land registration activities. More assessment of social needs and impacts would help to
investigate possible design features that could enhance the impact of the land administration program on
such vulnerable groups.
11. Issues or benefits can vary between urban and rural areas, which need to be separately
accommodated in the design of pro-poor measures. The kind of extra economic or social benefits that are
attainable in Kyrgyz would likely be very specific to its particular circumstances. For illustration (only),
however, opportunities might include: (i) reducing delays and complexity in getting construction permits
(Doing Business 2010 assesses that getting a construction permit in Kyrgyz involves 12 procedures and
averages 137 delays), which would make it easier for entrepreneurs and farmers to invest on their
property, thus enhancing the impact of improvements in land registration efficiency; (ii) small changes
in legislation for mortgage finance (as was done in Slovenia) to facilitate both lending and borrowing for
collateral-based finance; (iii) any actions that may help women in Kyrgyz to be fairly included in land
inheritance under customary law, or law influenced by customary traditions; and (iv) proactive and
targeted social inclusion measures in Laos and Bulgaria to increase the welfare of vulnerable groups.
12. The decision to first concentrate on urban areas was likely to have been the right decision - urban
land generally has higher factor productivity than rural land. But this ran contra to Kyrgyz's
development strategy to encourage economic growth in rural and poorer areas. Analysis or at least better
articulation of the reasons for this choice ­ the balance falling to higher economic growth in urban areas
presumably considered to outweigh likely higher social benefits in rural areas would have been
desirable. (A moratorium on transactions of rural lands at that time did not preclude economic benefits
from agricultural investment on securely owned land).

market, tempered by the limited consideration of productivity and social aspects, the
overall relevance of LRERP's Objective is assessed Substantial.

Relevance of design

3.5     LRERP's design was a targeted set of components providing all actions needed
to achieve LRERP's intended output ­ the "introduction of a reliable and well
functioning land and real estate registration system." The need for a strong institutional
and legal base was recognized and implemented through creation of Gosregister and
supporting legislation. The technical and human resource needs for cadastre and
registration services were comprehensively appraised. The features needed for
introducing modern technologies such as digitization of data and information
technology were identified. And the significant training needs for all personnel and
specializations were budgeted. These, and the particular features indicated below,
provided a design which effectively supported the project objective and the subsequent
implementation of the project.

3.6      A particularly important decision was to have land registration and cadastre
under one agency, as experience in Eastern Europe and Central Asia (ECA) and
elsewhere indicated that land administration was easier to coordinate under one
institution. This agency (Gosregister), and the basic legislative framework to make it
work, were established before the project was launched. A stand-alone land project was
proposed, as this had been found to be more effective than when land was part of a
multi-component project. LRERP's detailed features were pragmatically designed,
bearing in mind the implementation capacity of the newly formed agency, as well as of
Government and civil society: (i) surveying and mapping used less sophisticated
(hence more easily mastered) technology than was available internationally; (ii)
information technology was to be introduced gradually; (iii) the less costly and more
comprehensive systematic cadastre and registration was to be primarily used rather
than sporadic registration;13 (iv) the network of Land Registration Offices (LROs) was
to be rolled out progressively; (v) an institutional structure was set in place that would
enable Gosregister and the LROs to attain financial self-sufficiency over time; (vi) a
good management information system was established under the M&E program (socio-
economic aspects of M&E were, however, weak); and, not least, (vii) a major training
program was financed to tackle the evident constraint posed by the unfamiliarity of
most of the project activities. These practical features were well attuned to Kyrgyz's
particular circumstances. LRERP's relevance of design is assessed Substantial.
Considering the relevance of both LRERPs objectives and design, the project's overall
relevance was also Substantial.




13. Systematic registration maps and registers all land in a given area, whereas sporadic registration is
on-demand registration of individual properties. In a situation such as Kyrgyz's, where cadastral and
ownership records were so poor (or inexistent) that nearly all land required registration, bulk registration
reduces the chances of boundary disputes that can arise when only one property in an area is registered,
and is also much cheaper than sporadic registration.

EFFICACY

3.7     The project's objective, to: "Support development of markets for land and real
estate through the introduction of a reliable and well functioning land and real estate
registration system," can be considered in two parts: (i) a project Output ­ to introduce
"a reliable and well functioning land and real estate registration system;" and (ii) the
intended Outcome ­"development of markets for land and real estate." These are
discussed below.

Outputs: Establishing the real estate registration system

3.8     Developing a legislative base. The legislative framework for LRERP was
established early, with the "Law on State Registration of Rights to Immovable Property
and Transactions" in 1998 and the "Land Code" in 1999, both before Bank Board
approval. These laws established rights for private property, whereas previously all
land belonged to the state, and the legal basis for land transactions and other land
administration actions. There were numerous revisions to the laws during the LRERP
period to update the legal basis for the land administration program as experience was
gained. For instance, an adjustment was made to mandate inclusion of both the
husband and wife as property owners when registering a land transaction. The
registration manual (a document with legal status) was adjusted to incorporate lessons
from LRERP's field experience. A revised Law on State Registration was approved in
2003, mostly to package the amendments up to that point. More recently, the civil code
was modified to incorporate the major changes in registration procedures introduced in
May 2009. According to a lawyer responsible for much of the legislation, such
adjustments can be expected to continue and are healthy for a dynamic and growing
program. As an example, the further development of the unified information
technology system will likely require some legislative additions to establish the rights
of clients and Gosregister concerning procedures for data sharing. This adaptive and
practical approach has been effective.

3.9      Training. As a new agency, nearly all of Gosregister's staff required training.
Accordingly, an extensive training program was launched and sustained over the
project period. The predominant need was to train the staff of every new Land
Registration Office (LRO). Staff then received refresher training every year. Training
for all of Gosregister's activities was required, necessarily involving a broad
curriculum to cover the respective staff specializations within the agency. Over time
the curriculum expanded to handle other needs such as information technology and
M&E. A separate but complementary training program was funded by the Swedish
International Development Agency. LRERP's training program averaged about 500
persons trained per year (including more than one training course for some staff), a
massive undertaking, but necessary given the minimal land administration skills
available at project appraisal. In the combined view of Gosregister and Bank staff
involved with LRERP, and confirmed during the IEG mission's field visits, the effort
put into training has been a particularly important factor behind the project's
achievements.
                                                     11


3.10 Establishing an accessible registration network. As intended, a national network
of 50 Land Registration Offices was established under LRERP in three phases. Each
LRO was to perform all standard land administration processes and required the
necessary equipment and computers, and extensive staff training as described above.
All offices are operational, and in 2008 all handled at least some registrations. For the
more remote offices, however, business volume is low, which raises some questions
regarding their viability. On the other hand, there are social benefits. The LROs are
fairly evenly distributed and provide reasonable access to all, both in urban and rural
areas.14 In the 2007 Beneficiary Survey, which sampled clients from the 43 most active
LROs, nearly 90 percent of clients reported having to spend less than an hour to travel
to their nearest Gosregister office (Gosregister 2007).

3.11 The registration program. Cadastral registration achieved far more than
planned. As intended, systematic registration was the primary process used and enabled
comprehensive resolution of cadastral records involving the community as a whole.
Against a target of 600,000 properties the actual number of properties registered
systematically was 2.5 million (Table 3).15 One million properties were registered
sporadically, as against a target of 0.2 million properties. Most of these were for
secondary transactions that had occurred since systematic registration (and which could
include sales, leases, or mortgage transactions). Partly because of an increased
proportion of apartments being registered, the average costs of systematic registration
of $3.00/ property were lower than the expected cost of $9.00/property. Registration of
transactions was substantially influenced by market conditions, but an upwards trend is
noticeable over the project period (Figure 1). In 2002 and 2003, the second and third
years of LRERP, the number of registered sales averaged 22,000 properties. In the last
two project years, 2007 and 2008, registered sales averaged 46,000 properties, despite
the market downturn caused by the global financial crisis that was beginning to take
effect in 2008. By LRERP's completion, the number of rural systematic registrations
(1.3 million) was virtually the same as the number of urban registrations (1.4 million
properties), a remarkable progress in such a short time period. Gosregister estimates
that over 90 percent of rural and urban properties are now registered.




14. Such social impacts could, however, be examined more closely; the social benefits due to the
proximity of the existing network of 50 LROs may or may not justify the savings from a reduced number
of offices. Alternatives to full service LROs could also be considered; for instance, using remote offices
on a part-time basis (Gosregister is currently assessing options).
15. In rural areas, families tend to own multiple parcels: the land parcel and house of their residence; one
or more arable plots; and possibly orchard and pasture plots. In urban areas, families may own separate
properties for a business, a residence and other real property.

3.12 Information Technology. LRERP adopted a gradual approach to digitization
and creation of a unified electronic data base. In Kyrgyz's case this was sensible ­
Gosregister and its 50 LROs had to build up some capacity before launching an
electronic system. An attempt to establish a sophisticated information technology (IT)
system from the start could entangle institutional development and even jeopardize the
quality of operations. Instead, cadastral and registration records were initially prepared
manually with paper records. Gradually, new entries and old records were digitized,
starting with the larger LROs. Some of these offices (Bishkek, Kant) are now fully
digitized. The final stage ­ to create an automated registration system, with combined
(unified) cadastral and registration data constantly updated and made transparently
accessible to concerned users ­ is being piloted and prepared for roll-out nationwide.
Given the progress so far, there are good prospects that a full-fledged national system
will be achieved.

3.13     Financial Self Sufficiency. A priority for Gosregister, also supported by
Government, is to become financially self-sufficient. Substantial progress towards this
has already been made. Each LRO is meant to finance staff salaries and operational
expenses by retaining a margin of Gosregister's standard fees for each service.
According to Gosregister's registration department and Bank staff, about 40 of the 50
LROs can now cover their operating costs (salaries, materials, utilities), and, of these,
about 33 LROs also either fully cover or have short-term potential to cover the costs of
equipment renewals and depreciation. The target is to get all offices financially self-
sufficient within the next several years. Attaining financial autonomy has not been easy
in other countries, and the Kyrgyz example is instructive. Box 3 illustrates the robust
financial independence of one of Gosregister's best LROs. Of note is that the office has
a sufficient gross margin to also finance the costs of activities with a public good
element, such as digitization of old records and systematic registration which are both
provided free.
                                                          13


    Box 2: A Self-sufficient Registration Office
    Kant Registration Office is one of Gosregister's most successful LROs and is financially self-sufficient
    with the status of a state enterprise. A growth in business has increased revenues from its services (land
    transactions, information,,and other services) from 3.7 million som ($90,000) in 2005 to 9.7 million som
    ($265,000) in 2008. Fees are the standard (low) fees set by Gosregister. Despite these low fees, the
    revenues cover all operating costs including salaries, utilities, materials, and renewals of equipment and
    furnishings. (Start-up investments, however, were financed by LRERP). The LRO has self-funded a
    progressive digitization of old paper records, and the office donates some money to charities. The LRO
    provides salaries for staff well above Government rates, and adds bonuses quarterly and on special
    holidays. The Director has nearly tripled her staff's salaries in the last four years. She considers that such
    salaries develop trust and provide incentives for quality work. As fees are modest in comparison to most
    countries, financial self-sufficiency has primarily been achieved through gains in efficiency. A client
    commented to the IEG mission that in 2004 he had taken about a month to register a land purchase. But
    in November 2009, it was done in 2 ½ days.
    Source: IEG mission field visit


    3.14 Gosregister's legal status and institutional structure ­ each LRO as a state
    enterprise and Gosregister as a state agency - has helped the progression towards self-
    sufficiency. It has enabled the LROs to collect and retain revenues and has made
    contributions from them to Gosregister's operational costs possible. Gosregister and
    the LROs, as entities handling both cadastral and registration activities (the single
    agency model), can cross-subsidize their cadastral activities from the greater revenues
    stream resulting from the registration program.16 And Government's Anti Monopoly
    Service provides oversight of fees, somewhat like a regulator of a government utility.

    3.15 One of the reasons why a large number of the LROs have attained financial self
    reliance has been the continuous quest by Gosregister to increase efficiency. The most
    significant change was a radical streamlining of the registration process in 2009 (refer
    below) which substantially reduced costs. The current fee charged by Gosregister for
    purchase of a commercial property (there are no other charges) is 2,500 Som (about
    $55), which represents only 0.2 percent of the value of a typical property, a low fee
    relative to most other countries (Table 6).

    3.16 Achieving Operational Efficiency. A widely used gauge of the efficiency of a
    land administration service is to assess performance for the purchase of a property
    based on three measures: (i) the number of procedures that are needed; (ii) the time
    typically taken, and (iii) the cost of registration expressed as a percentage of the
    property's value. These measures are used annually in the World Bank Group's Doing
    Business series. The same criteria have been used for Kyrgyz in this PPAR, but with
    procedures and data updated and adjusted to reflect findings from mission discussions


16 . Merging the LROs and Gosregister into one institution, which would facilitate cross-subsidization
between LROs and between LROs and Gosregister headquarters, and closure of less viable offices are also
being considered. (Other options might include reducing staffing of remote LROs to one person who would
act as an intermediary with a larger office; possible mobile offices; and greater use of electronic transfer of
work to the larger offices.)
                                                     14


with Gosregister and clients. For Kyrgyz, data from two time periods has been
measured (Table 4): (i) from 2008 to April 2009; and (ii) for the new streamlined
processes introduced in May 2009 and which are still applicable.

3.17 Gosregister's operational efficiency in 2008 is detailed at Annex A, Table A1.
The client had to visit Gosregister four times; seven procedures were involved; a
technical inspection was mandatory, often requiring a field survey by Gosregister; and
charges included a state duty, fees for a notary, and Gosregister's fees. Still, Kyrgyz's
efficiency was rated amongst the upper third of countries covered by Doing Business
(52nd out of 183 countries). This was a relatively good achievement, given that there
was no experience with modern land administration before the project. Customers
were, nevertheless, still voicing their interest in having further improvements, as found
in Gosregister's 2007 Social Survey, and expressed to the IEG mission by several
clients interviewed. The improving service was generally appreciated, but there were
complaints about certain bottlenecks in the procedures prior to 2009. The delay
involved surveying a property was a common complaint.17 However, consistent with
Gosregister's low fees, the costs of Gosregister's services were not a major concern of
clients. Thus, in the 2007 survey only 11 percent of clients considered that costs were
excessive and were part of the difficulties registering a property.

3.18 The new procedures (Annex Table A2), prepared in 2008 and introduced by
Gosregister in May 2009 radically reduced the complexity and time for property
registration. A technical inspection was no longer required, a notary was not needed as
Gosregister now verified all documentation, and taxes were removed. These changes
reduced the total time required from about 22 days to 5 days18 and, in Doing Business
2010, Kyrgyz's global ranking for land administration efficiency improved, from 52nd
to 19th out of 183 countries. The LRERP has also become one of the best-performing
land administration systems in the Bank's ECA Region portfolio.




17. "Many clients, organizations and staff of Gosregister think that requirement to conduct annual
technical inventory of existing structures and to submit copies of passport each time are unnecessary for
securing rights and registering them." (Gosregister 2007)
18. Time durations are the typical times taken for all procedures and all entities involved in the
registration process. Any procedural step is assumed to be a minimum of one day, even where it may
take a matter of hours. For instance, under the post-May 2009 procedures, Gosregister has a service
standard of 3 days. But for the client to go to Gosregister to drop off the documents required for
registration, and for pick-up by the client of documents after completion of registration, each action is
taken automatically as one day in each case; hence the time taken for registration is taken as five days
rather than Gosregister's time of three or fewer days. The use here of a day for each client action (and a
minimum of one day for each process) is consistent with the methodology used by Doing Business,
enabling direct comparison with Doing Business estimates for other countries.

3.19 LRERP's output achievements overall. LRERP achieved and in some aspects
significantly surpassed the targets established at appraisal. Necessary legislation and an
institution to be responsible for land registration were established at the beginning of
the project. The legislation was effectively adapted during project implementation to
respond to the learning gained from experience and to evolving needs. Gosregister
developed to an effective institution, a significant achievement given that it started
from scratch and Kyrgyz had no experience in modern land administration. A strong
training program throughout the project period helped in this regard and supported
creation of a national network of registration offices. Registration achievements were
                                                    16


in excess of targets ­ 2.7 million properties were systematically registered against a
targeted 600,000 properties. Operational efficiency (time, cost and number of
procedures involved in a property transaction) has developed to the point where
Kyrgyz has become a country to emulate. Progress towards financial self-sufficiency,19
a difficult area for many countries, has been steady, and, with some 80 percent of
LROs already covering operating costs, and an established institutional and legislative
structure to enable financial independence, appears attainable. In the key activities
leading to an effective land administration ­ legislation, training and creating the
project's institutional base - achievements were fully attained resulting in a registration
program greater than targeted and an operational efficiency assessed by Doing
Business 2010 as among the top 15 percent of countries world-wide. LRERP more than
met its intention to "introduce an effective land registration system"

Outcome: Developing a Property Market

3.20 The intended outcome of the new system of land reforms supported by LRERP
was "development of markets for land and real estate." The real property market grew
considerably in the 2000s.20 As shown in Figure 1, the number of mortgages against
land collateral and the number of properties sold in Kyrgyz nearly doubled during the
project period. In value terms, growth has been even larger - average property prices
and the value of mortgages both increased six-fold (Figure 2). This and increased
trading volume have translated to major changes in the overall size of the market. In
current terms, the value of mortgages issued annually increased from $85 million in
2002 to $1.3 billion in 2008, a ten-fold increase.21 In the same period, annual sales of
land and real estate increased eight-fold - from $123 million to about $1.5 billion in
2007.22




19. Financial self sufficiency was only mentioned briefly in the PAD and was not targeted in LRERP's
monitorable indicators. But financial autonomy can be expected to contribute to Gosregister's long-term
effectiveness and sustainability.
20. No targets for development of a real property market were specified at appraisal.
21. The rural land market does not appear to be a major contributor to the aggregate developments noted
above, particularly for longer-term loans. Central Bank data show that outstanding agricultural loans of
more than one year duration were less than $50 million in 2007. Data for seasonal credit are not
available. The limited amount of longer term rural loans will primarily be due to the moratorium on sales
of agricultural land imposed by Government and applied for most of the project period. Also, LRERP's
systematic registration of rural areas only began in the second half of the project period, and collateral
may be more difficult to get for farmers in isolated locations.
22. Values in constant 2002 terms are $840 million for mortgages (2008) and $974 million for sales
(2007).

3.21 By no means can these developments be ascribed primarily to the project ­
limited supply of property and excess liquidity has made real estate an attractive
investment in Kyrgyz. And the extraordinary market growth rates suggest the probable
influence of multiple macro variables: demand and supply as indicated above, and
other factors such as the general business climate and GDP growth. But, based on
experience in other countries, it can reasonably be expected that the project will have
enabled and stimulated development of the land market ­ a reliable land administration
                                                     18


service was simply not there before. There is no data to provide inferences on cause
and effect, and attribution would be difficult even if data did exist. But, from
international experience, LRERP's enabling role was likely to have been the assured
tenure that it provided to embolden finance institutions to provide mortgages against
collateral of now formally recognized property ownership. Also, property owners,
knowing that their land and real property investments were secure, would be more
interested in borrowing and investing, and purchasers would be willing to pay more for
a property guaranteed to be theirs. The magnitude of market growth during the project
period, and favorable assessments from clients to the IEG mission regarding LRERP's
role in the market developments, are persuasive proxies that LRERP has indeed
supported the intended project outcome ­ development of the land market. LRERP's
efficacy was High.

SOCIAL IMPACTS

3.22 The preponderance of views in Kyrgyz is that there are no major issues
concerning LRERP's benefits for women headed households, poorer families, and rural
communities. All persons ­ regardless of gender, age, or income - have access to
Gosregister's services, with the same fees and processes. The law provides the same
rights for women as for men, and LRO staff may also provide informal help to persons
experiencing difficulties.23 In short, the registration program is considered "neutral"
given that procedures and tariffs are the same regardless of gender and social stratum.
Gosregister staff also point out that there are already some significant features of
LRERP that improve social inclusion; among them the nationwide network of LROs
facilitating access from remote areas, the free-of-charge systematic registration; and
transaction registration costs at low rates. Also, there are some specific programs to
promote social inclusion by other development agencies.24 Nevertheless, the primary
activities of LRERP itself, the implementer of the land administration program do not
contain a social dimension. In essence, as stated in a recent Bank document: "This
project (LRERP) does not explicitly target poor people, but poor and other
disadvantaged people, mostly in rural areas, will benefit from the project's focus on
improved services and information."25

3.23 Gosregister staff, other Kyrgyz officials, and Bank staff also consider that the
most important and immediate social influence of land registration is its provision of
clear land rights and security of tenure.26 LRERP's social impacts, where mentioned,
appear to be typically considered along the following lines: after registration of their

23. This is a possibly underestimated social aspect of land administration operations. As witnessed by
the IEG mission in one LRO, and commented on by Gosregister staff as not unusual in other registration
offices, informal help may be provided by LROs to elderly, disabled or illiterate persons (for example,
help with filling in forms or accessing documents).
24. A legal assistance program for rural communities was financed under Swiss cooperation. The
Swedish Development Agency (Sida) provided training on social and gender inclusion.
25. World Bank 2008.
26. The 1999 Social Assessment of land administration issues conducted during preparation of LRERP
found that almost all clients interviewed, especially those in rural areas, emphasized insecure land tenure
rights as a key issue. ("Social Assessment, Kyrgyz Republic: Land Registration Project," December
2009).
                                                     19


land, more socially vulnerable families (the poor and women, especially in more
remote areas) would be less susceptible to pressures on land ownership or usage from
more influential parties, and would have easier access to credit. Such views are
consistent with experience in a number of other countries, but they are not automatic
and the degree to which access to benefits is actually the same across different social
strata may be particularly variable. In the case of LRERP, there is minimal empirical
analysis to back up presumed social impacts such as the above. Moreover, from the
data that is available, the actual situation appears much more complex.

3.24 The view that land services in Kyrgyz are sufficiently socially inclusive simply
by the inherent nature of land administration is not consistent with the limited
information that is available. Gosregister's most recent Social Survey (2009) indicates
that ease of access to land administration services are considered by clients not to be
equal. When asked which type of client received the best service from Gosregister,
only seven percent felt that women and veterans received the best service. The
remaining 93 percent were considered to have had much more privileged access (Table
5).

3.25 Any underestimation of social issues in Kyrgyz would not be the first case for
an ECA country. A 2007 farm survey of four ECA countries (Bulgaria, Moldova,
Azerbaijan and Kazakhstan) found that apparently gender-neutral legislation and
procedures might need special features to enable equal effective access for women to
land administration services as were available for men.27 And, about 70 percent of
divorced women surveyed in Tajikistan did not get property after divorce.28

3.26 A possible source of complications in Kyrgyz might stem from the
juxtaposition of the traditional customary law with the relatively recent written
legislation.29 In traditional areas, customary law, which does not provide automatic
inheritance by a widow, might prevail. Or land grabbing by a powerful family or


27. "Qualitative interviews suggest that although formal legislation and procedures are largely gender
neutral in all four countries, women's access to information and legal recourse is substantially less than
men's" (Dudwick, Fock, and Sedik 2007, p. 66).

enterprise might be legitimized as a result of formal land registration (Box 2).30 It
would be desirable for Kyrgyz to investigate LRERP's social impacts. For any issue
identified, there may be relatively straightforward ways to reduce these risks, or even
better, to actually enhance social benefits. For instance, in Bulgaria, a legal assistance
network is available to landowners. In Laos, a strong bias towards male land ownership
was substantially reduced with a network of village volunteer women, who received
training and then counseled the women in their village on land rights and transaction
processes.31

3.27 Such examples and Gosregister's own survey suggest that social inclusion
issues cannot be ignored in Kyrgyz. A common finding with land administration
projects, illustrated by some of the examples above, is that specific actions need to be
included in a land administration project in order to include disadvantaged groups in
project benefits, and to protect them from any adverse impacts. This was missing in
LRERP.

Box 3: Access to Land for Women and the Poor
Concerns about the access of women and the poor to land services have been raised by a number
of sources. For instance:
· "There is no legal discrimination against Kyrgyz women in the matter of inheritance: The
   Family Code guarantees equal rights in regard to the distribution of property. (but) In rural
   areas, women are discriminated against in the disposal of family property." (FAO 2010.)
· "There are differences in the extent to which men versus women hold land ... which result
   from the wider cultural and socioeconomic culture of the country." (World Bank 2008b, p. 14.
   Second Land and Real Estate Project, PAD)
· "When households break down, due to abandonment, divorce, or death of a spouse, women's
   access to land is jeopardized because under customary law, men "own" the land and house."
   (Giovarelli 2001)
· "Customary law appears to super-cede the written law in many rural villages, although women have the
  legal right to land as individuals, this right is rarely exercised." (Women's Rights to Land in the Kyrgyz
  Republic. (Giovarelli 2001)
· "The procedures (registration) are the same for all people, but some people need special attention:
  socially disadvantaged population, disabled people" (Gosregister 1999.)
· "Access to courts for rural people, and especially rural women, is limited by the costs .... of hiring legal
  representation, travelling to court, and paying court fees." ( Giovarelli 2001)
"Legislation and procedures that appear gender neutral because they do not make a distinction
between the rights of men and women may, nevertheless, affect men and women in very different
ways, given how traditional gender relationships and stereotypes affect access to information,
resources and power." (Dudwick, Fock, and Sedik 2007)




30. In Russia and Kazakhstan, land speculators, including large conglomerates, are cited as having
exploited poor or less educated families through buying up their land immediately after land distribution.
(Lerman, Csaki, and Feder 2004; Deininger 2005).

EFFICIENCY

3.28 An economic rate of return was not calculated for LRERP, either at appraisal or
in the Implementation Completion and Results Report (ICR), on the grounds that the
macro-variables that could be assumed influenced by the project (such as land market
size, collateral based investments and mortgage interest rates) are so large relative to
project costs that even small changes in the estimated value of a variable could result in
large changes in the rate-of-return result. Nevertheless, cost-effectiveness comparisons
indicate that LRERP brought in a highly efficient service. As concerns systematic
registration (two-thirds of project costs), the cost per property was about $2.75. This is
low relative to other ECA countries where registration costs are $5 and up, although
cross-country comparisons are complicated by different conditions.32 There is no
disaggregated data to differentiate LRERP's efficiency between the rural and urban
sectors.

3.29 A more directly comparable activity is registering real estate transactions, as the
essence of the action ­ change of ownership ­ is the same across countries. Here,
Kyrgyz stands out. The analysis of LRERP's operational efficiency in the efficacy
section shows that the average registration costs for a land transaction of 0.2 percent of
property value compares well with the ECA regional average of 2.2 percent and with
the average for OECD countries of 4.6 percent (Table 6). Kyrgyz has also gained
efficiency over time - in 2005, LRERP's registration costs were about 6 percent of
property value.

3.30 Another way of assessing LRERP's viability is to compare the cost of the
project - $11 million ­ with some of the variables that LRERP can be expected to have
influenced. Thus, the increase in mortgages against land collateral of $1.2 billion is
over 100 times the total project cost. Even if only half of the value of mortgages was
directed to investment and the project only influenced the size of investment by two
percent, project costs would already be covered. Based on international experience
LRERP's market influences are likely to have been more than this arithmetic. Ministry
of Finance staff consider that LRERP's market impact has been strong. Without formal
title, it had been difficult to get mortgages in the past, and secure land transactions need
a recorded and legal base for the new owner. All of these indicators point to a robust
economic impact. The Efficiency of LRERP was high.

Monitoring and evaluation
3.31 LRERP's M&E program is assessed based on its Design, Implementation and
Utilization of the data.




32. Comparisons of land administration costs can be misleading. The degree of survey work for
systematic land registration was low in Krgyz as cadastre could be based partly on Soviet period data.
Also, the nature of the property influences costs. In Kyrgyz's case registration of urban apartments was
relatively low cost.
                                                    22


DESIGN

3.32 The PAD provided minimal information regarding the purpose and activities
for monitoring and evaluation. The references to monitoring that were cited were
almost entirely related to the monitoring of the project's physical progress or quality of
implementation. In such management information system (MIS) type data the M&E
program was well designed, as attested by the availability of most of the data related to
LRERP's achievement indicators shown in Table 1. However, monitoring of project
outcome was hardly mentioned in the PAD, and the few references made were
restricted to development of the land market and not to investment on the property and
productivity changes. There was also no disaggregation of data by gender, social strata
and rural-urban situations. The quality of design for LRERP's M&E system was
Modest.

IMPLEMENTATION

3.33 Nevertheless, an institutional structure was established and provided a
functional base for developing the MIS aspects of the M&E program. M&E was
headed by a specialist in the PIU, with a network of six regional coordinators who,
between them, made regular visits to the 50 local registration offices. The M&E
coordinator also established links with the central bank and other finance institutions to
gather market data such as trends in sales or mortgages, very relevant to the project's
central objective.

3.34 The MIS developed into a sophisticated system providing regular data to
Gosregister management and Government. This was valuable and included data to
track performance of each LRO, such as the average time taken to register a
transaction, complaints received, and compliance by each office with established
registration procedures. There were also three surveys in the project period: at
appraisal, at project mid-term, and in 2007 (the latter termed the "beneficiary survey"),
and another survey in 2009. These provide a useful broadening of information for
assessing the project's progress. But most of the data measures outputs (for example,
the number of registrations per month, the time taken registering a property, client
satisfaction with the service), rather than outcomes such as improvements in welfare
and social impacts, and increased investments.33 As a result, even these surveys were
primarily of an MIS nature. For a service delivery project such as LRERP, a
management information system to assess the quality and development of the service is
the core implementation need; but increased attention to outcomes would have been
desirable.

3.35 Another area to consider is the right balance between monitoring and project
implementation. The M&E unit has been extensively used by Gosregister for quality
control, which is a natural companion to monitoring of service performance. But the
M&E unit may be overly involved in hands-on project implementation. For instance,

33. A commendable development since project closure has been the proposal by the M&E unit of several
strategic studies with an outcome orientation: for instance, on access to credit for housing construction
and commercial investments; and access to land for house construction.
                                            23


the unit is involved with decisions on staff training, and with public awareness
programs, and participates in meetings with stakeholders and when planning systematic
registration campaigns. Implementation of M&E had the same gaps on the outcome
side as in its design, but operational monitoring was Substantial.

UTILIZATION

3.36 Although the design gaps had limited M&E to a predominantly MIS type
program, this information was important for monitoring Gosregister's development
program and efficiency, and M&E was effective in this operational role. The M&E unit
prepares a project progress report including some outcome related data (for example,
mortgages and property sales) every quarter. The PIU management advised the IEG
mission that the data system had proven to be an important management tool for
assessing the progress and quality of service of the project. Utilization of M&E was
Substantial.

OVERALL M&E RATING

3.37 A strong MIS, which was assiduously and effectively used by project
management to improve performance, is qualified by gaps in the M&E of outcomes
and social welfare. Nevertheless, LRERP's M&E is assessed Substantial overall based
on the good connectivity between the MIS system and its application in operational
decisions.

Risk to Development Outcome
3.38 LRERP's risk to development outcome is assessed as Significant. Most of the
project's risks can be addressed by Government and Gosregister and, with vigilance
and actions as appropriate, can be mitigated, but political risks are less predictable:

3.39 Political and management risks: Recent socio-political events in Kyrgyz have
introduced considerable uncertainty over the short-term. For the medium and longer
term, awareness (already present across a broad spectrum of civil society) of the
importance of an effective land administration service may be a sustaining influence on
government commitment to the program.

3.40 Political pressures could influence the choice of managers and staff for
Gosregister. It will be essential that management staff continue to be selected
judiciously and are given the mandate and senior government back-up to operate as a
technical institution, protected from political or other vested interests. The ongoing
reorganization of government agencies presents questions on how it will affect
Gosregister's performance. Nevertheless, as discussed above, demand from clients is
likely to put pressure on both Government and Gosregister to maintain a good land
administration service. In the medium-term, the Bank's presence under the Second
Land and Real Estate Registration Project will also influence Gosregister's sound
governance.
                                                   24


3.41 Financial independence. To date, Government has effectively supported
Gosregister's program, but rationing of counterpart funding in the first two years of the
project illustrates the potential risks from relying on the budget process. Financial self-
sufficiency would avert this risk, and to an extent would protect Gosregister from any
untoward political pressure. LRERP has progressed well towards financial
independence (some 80 percent of LROs cover at least their operating costs), and the
extra mile, to a fully independent agency and LROs, would be well worthwhile. With
the possible exception of some remote LROs, this is attainable, although economic
fluctuations could affect the volume of transactions and hence of fees. An additional
consideration for Kyrgyz is the possible impact of the rapidly expanding mortgage
market on the quality of the banking sector's lending portfolio.34

3.42 Governance and corruption: A number of good-practice measures were taken
by Gosregister to make its operations as transparent as possible: posting service fees in
customer waiting areas; separating processors from accountants; providing a waiting
number system so that a customer cannot determine which Gosregister staff will handle
his business: and providing a "complaint box". This appears to have had some effect.
In the 2007 customer survey 15 percent of clients said they had experienced corruption
(90 percent of these cases were for expediting registration processes rather than
changing the substance of what Gosregister was doing). For a country ranked 162nd out
of 180 nations in Transparency International's 2009 Corruption Perceptions Index,35
the transparency of Gosregister's operations appears to be better than it might have
been. Nevertheless, Gosregister will need to continue its efforts to maximize
transparency and to reduce the risk of corruptive practices damaging institutional
integrity.

Bank Perfomance
QUALITY AT ENTRY

3.43 The Bank fielded a team with a good skills mix and substantial experience in
land administration and ECA land projects. The Bank team provided continuous
guidance, and the technical expertise to design a project suited to the country's
circumstances. The resultant design, except as regards the limited attention to social
issues and M&E, was strong, in particular: a single agency implementation model,
which was particularly desirable in a country with still limited administrative capacity;
a stand-alone project rather than part of a multi-component project; the emphasis on


34. The very high land market growth rates in Kyrgyz would in part be due to changes in GDP growth
rates, changes in the investment climate, speculative land purchases or other macro-influences on the
land market. Experience in a number of countries is that rapid increases in land and property values
accompanied by rapid increases in bank lending have resulted in deterioration of the quality of the
banks' portfolios; and experience has also shown the need for monitoring and regulating the banking
sector.
35. Transparency International publishes an annual list assessing transparency (corruption) by country.
The ranking of Kyrgyz in recent years has been: 2005-130th; 2006-142nd; 2007-150th; 2008-166th;
and 2009-62nd. (Ranking is expressed as the number of countries assessed to have more transparency

self-sufficiency (over time); an intensive training program; phased implementation of
the LROs; and gradual introduction of information technology as Gosregister gained
capacity. It was also recognized that the project should start with the legal basis and
implementation agency already established, and these were created before Board
approval. Quality at entry was Satisfactory.

QUALITY OF SUPERVISION

3.44 The Bank team was intensively involved with the project. In LRERP's first
three years, the intervals between missions were only four months, which in the case of
a new institution charged with unfamiliar activities was helpful. The team provided
hands-on guidance to Gosregister helping it develop into a well performing agency.
The Bank was flexible where strategically appropriate: agreement to extend the project
period enabled Gosregister to consolidate its institutional capacity, to expand the
systematic titling program, and to provide more time for preparation of a follow-on
project based on the greater experience that LRERP's extension provided. The
consistent view of Gosregister and Government persons met by the IEG mission was
that the Bank (in both design and supervision) had been an essential partner. The
Bank's technical expertise and its ability to engage policy makers on key issues were
the two most commonly cited qualities. Quality of supervision was Highly Satisfactory.

3.45 Taking account of the Bank's performance during both project preparation and
implementation, the Bank's overall performance was Satisfactory.36

Borrower Performance
GOVERNMENT PERFORMANCE

3.46 In most respects, Government provided exemplary support to the project. It
appointed a strong management and team for Gosregister and backed the agency up
when politically sensitive decisions needed to be made centrally or with the local
governments. Necessary legislation and regulatory changes were approved, including
sensible adjustments during project implementation as experience was gained.
Government also protected Gosregister from other institutions which wanted to take
over parts of its activities. However, Government fell short providing counterpart
funding during the first two years of the project. An otherwise highly supportive
Government effort is thus best assessed as Satisfactory when performance is
considered overall.

IMPLEMENTING AGENCY PERFORMANCE

3.48 Gosregister performed well. It was strongly committed to the project, and the
leadership and other senior staff were effective champions of the land administration
reforms. Training of its staff was a priority, and built institutional capacity. Gosregister

36. Under the IEG-OPCS guidelines, when the parts of an overall rating differ, and both are positive or
both are negative, unless justified by exceptional circumstances, the lower of the two ratings is taken for
the overall rating.

used initiative in adapting the project as experience was gained. All monitorable
indicators were met, and the review of LRERP's efficacy has shown high quality
achievements. (Specific social inclusion measures and socio-economic aspects of M&E
were not greatly improved during project implementation, but these were design issues
and not part of Gosregister's operational mandate.) Most important in evaluating
Gosregister is to assess its performance from the context of the project as a whole: the
bottom line is that a project embarking on an ambitious program of activities largely
new to Kyrgyz was successfully implemented, and Gosregister reached operational
efficiency levels comparable to the world's best performing countries. Implementing
agency performance was Highly Satisfactory.

3.49 Taking account of a mostly strong performance by the Kyrgyz Government and
the particularly strong project implementation by Gosregister, the Borrower's
performance is rated Satisfactory overall.



4. Lessons
4.1     The experience of the Kyrgyz Republic Land and Real Estate Registration
Project yields the following main lessons:

   ·   A single implementation agency for land administration has operational
       advantages over a dual or multi-agency approach. As the sole agency
       responsible for land administration, it was easier for Gosregister to coordinate
       cadastral and registration activities, to reduce bottlenecks, and to improve
       efficiency (paras. 3.6, 3.21 and 3.43).

   ·   The project's success can be attributed in part to several design factors (a) the
       implementing agency and supporting legislation were established before
       project implementation; (b) the project prioritized development of a trained
       cadre of professional staff; and (c) large-scale or complex activities were
       introduced in phases. Gosregister could commence operations immediately.
       Major training built staff proficiency in all key skills. The network of
       registration offices and the digitization and information technology systems
       were developed progressively in line with evolving management and technical
       capacity (para. 3.6).

   ·   Continuous monitoring of service indicators and flexibility to adjust procedures
       as experience is gained can significantly enhance service efficiency. Gosregister
       progressed from modest operational efficiency (about 22 days to register a
       transaction and involving 7 procedures) to one that most countries would wish
       to emulate (5 days for registering a transaction (of which Gosregister time is 3
       days) and involving only 3 procedures). The difference was because of ongoing
       monitoring against service standards, and examination of procedures for cutting
       out if not needed (paras. 3.15 to 3.18).
                                         27


·   With efficient operations and institutional arrangements, a land administration
    service can be financially autonomous. Experience from other countries is that
    achieving financial independence is often difficult, and in some cases the point
    is made that self-sufficiency cannot be expected for services with a public
    goods element. Yet, subsequent to the initial investments, Gosregister has most
    of its LROs financially independent (paras 3.20 and 3.22 and Box 2) despite the
    relatively low fees it charges to clients (Tables 5 and 6). Factors behind
    Gosregister's relative success are: (i) the enabling legislative and institutional
    arrangements (LROs, as state enterprises, can earn, retain and spend revenues
    independent of government); (ii) the single agency system (LROs and
    Gosregister cover both cadastre and registration) which streamlines operations
    and means that each office can cross-subsidize, as needed, cadastre from
    registration revenues; and, (iv) close monitoring by Gosregister, through a good
    management information system of the operational efficiency of each LRO.
    (paras 3.13 to 3.15)

·   The social aspects of land administration projects need to be considered at the
    design stage and built into project design. Social impacts need to be monitored,
    with flexibility to adapt the project in response to M&E findings. Gosregister's
    good operational monitoring was not matched by monitoring and special
    studies on the social side. For issues such as the impact of cadastre and
    registration on the poor, women, less-educated and other potentially vulnerable
    groups, there is little knowledge of the land administration program's effect and
    how the welfare of these groups might be protected or improved (paras. 3.22 to
    3.27 and 3.31 to 3.35).

purchase by a business of land and warehouse on periphery of Bishkek; (iii) time of registration assumes a
relatively straightforward and undisputed case; (iv) surveying of property is chosen by buyer not to be done
as surveying is no longer manadatory and existing cadastral data is adequate; (v) calculation method
follows "Doing Business" methodology but uses Gosregister/client estimates and data as of December
2009; (v) assumed value of property is $37,000; and (vi) every action is assumed to take at least 1 day ­
this includes first visit to Gosregister (procedure 1), and pick-up of title (procedure 3). NB. Doing Business
assumes using a notary (Som 40,000 plus photocopying charges) which is now an option rather than
mandatory.

                                 Dear Mr. Roger Robinson,

    Re:    Draft Project Performance Assessment Report for the Land and Real Estate
                                  Registration Project
                                  (Credit No. 337-KG)


       Hereby I would like to express the appreciation to you and the World Bank for the
support to economic reforms conducted by the Government of the Kyrgyz Republic aimed at
improving the social and economic life of the population of the Kyrgyz Republic and for the
high rating assigned by the Independent Evaluation Group to the Land and Real Estate
Registration Project results.


    The following results have been achieved during implementation of this project:

    - Management capacity has been established to control registration systems and
         promote land market development;
    - 50 local registration offices have been established throughout the republic, which
         operate of a self-financing basis;
    - Legal regulatory and procedural data bases have been established to manage land
         resources;
    - Titles to 2.7 million units of real estate have been registered in a systemic manner
         (for free);
    - Information technologies have been introduced, the real estate database has been
established; access to data on land management is being improved.


     We believe that the project goals and objectives have been achieved; as the result the a
reliable and well-functioning system of registration of titles to land and real estate has been
introduced, the land and real estate markets are functioning and developing in the Kyrgyz
Republic, and we fully agree with the rating of the independent WB evaluation team.
        As you know, the project outcomes have significantly exceeded the initial
expectations, and thanks to the achievements the first project has been recognized by the
World Bank management as one of the most successful projects across the world and have
Annex D                                              38


received the award "Letter Life for People in Europe and Central Asia" at the awarding
ceremony in Washington on April 3, 2008.


Given the above mentioned achievements, upon request of the Government of the Kyrgyz
Republic the World Bank made a decision to finance the second project to strengthen further
land and real estate markets and cadastral cartography.

    Once again I would like to express my gratitude and hopes for further fruitful
cooperation.




    Sincerely,

    State Secretary                                             K. Shamkanov
