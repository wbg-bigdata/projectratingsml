INTERNATIONAL BANK FOR RECONSTRUCTION AND DEVELOPMENT
REPORT AND RECOMMENIIATION OF THEI PRESII)ENT
TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS
ON A PROPOSED FIFTH LOAN TO
SOCIETE NATIONALE D'INVESTISSEMENT
WITH THE GUARA4TEE OF THE REPUBLIC OF TUNISIA
1.        I submit the following report and recommendation on a proposed
loan to Societe Nationale d'Investissement S.A. (SNI) to be guaranteed by
the Republic of Tunisia, for the equivalent of US$14 million to help finance
lending for industry and tourism. Amortization would conform substantially
to the aggregate of the amortization schedules applicable to the specific
investment projects financed out of the proceeds of the loan, with a maxi-
mum period of 20 years for individual investment projects. The interest
rate would be 7-1/4 percent per annum.
PART I - THE ECONOMY
2.        A report entitled "Current Economic Position and Prospects of
Tunisia" (EMA-51a) was distributed to the Executive Directors on August 14,
1972. A country Data Sheet (Annex I) and a map of Tunisia are attached.
3.        Tunisia's development has been hampered by scarcity of natural re-
sources. Agriculture, a major sector in the economy, is highly dependent
on rainfall. Minerals, particularly phosphates, are mostly of low quality
and have suffered from deteriorating world market conditions. Industrial
development has been handicapped by the small size of the domestic market
and in most sectors a lack of skills and experience has been a constraint.
However, petroleum was discovered in the mid-sixties and has since become
a relatively significant source of revenue. Tourism expanded rapidly, con-
tributing to regional development, employment and foreign exchange earnings.
Tunisia's traditional society is beginning to modernize owing largely to
fast expanding education and social services. In the 1960s, development
policies favored social objectives and assigned a major role to the public
sector. Public investment concentrated heavily on long-term yielding proj-
ects with little emphasis on immediate needs to increase production. Over-
all economic performance remained disappointing. A new development strategy
was introduced in 1970, whose main objectives are to increase production,
exports and employment, and to achieve this mainly by encouraging private
initiative, reducing direct Government involvement in economic decisions
and relaxing administrative regulations.
4.        Following a period of slow growth, barely 4% between 1960 and 1970,
GDP in real terms increased by 9 percent in 1971, and may increase by as much
as 19 percent in 1972, because of exceptional agricultural crops, a very good
tourist season, higher oil prices and increased workers' remittances. The
new Government policies have revived confidence in the private sector, which
in turn appears to have benefited most sectors of the economy. Investment
has been stepped up, increasing by 18% in 1971 to account for some 22% of



GDP.  The balance of payments position improved considerably.    Foreign exchange
earnings in 1971 were substantially higher than in 1970, due to higher export
prices for petroleum and the expansion of tourism and workers' remittances.
The current deficit declined from $93.7 million to about $48.6 million despite
rising imports. Since capital inflows remained at a high level, net foreign
exchange assets increased by about $95 million to about $100 million at the
end of 1971 and $147 million by mid 1972. The sharp rise in savings to a
level equivalent to 20% of GDP (compared with an average of 16% in 1969-70)
and 85% of investment (66% in 1969-70), was reflected in a decline in the
resource gap to about 3% of GDP.
5.        The improved economic and financial situation facilitated a con-
tinued liberalization of economic policies. To stimulate competition, the
Government further reduced import restrictions on spare parts and raw mate-
rials for domestic manufacturers. Approval procedures for new investments
were considerably eased and banks were given more responsibility in allocat-
ing investment funds. The Government has undertaken a thorough review of
the tax system, including customs tariffs, and is now introducing a number
of reforms designed to stimulate production, encourage exports and achieve
greater equity and simplicity in administrative procedures. These develop-
ments have led to a sharp r:Lse in private investment projects submitted for
official approval during 1971.
6.        There has been less progress in relaxing price regulations and in
reorganizing state-owned enterprises. In 1971/72 an inter-ministerial com-
mittee recommended changes in the financial structure, operations and man-
agement of six of these enterprises but the measures so far taken have been
largely insufficient.
7.        Agriculture is still the dominant sector in the economy.    It pro-
vides nearly half of the employment, 30 percent of merchandise exports and
17 percent of GDP; food processing industries account for another 5 percent
of GDP and over a third of value added in manufacturing. Agricultural out-
put stagnated during the second half of the 1960's, due to unfavorable weather,
unsuccessful organizational changes introduced under land reforms, and tthe
lack of modern skills and inputs. The new Government policies, since 1970,
have renewed confidence of private farmers. Due to their revived initiative
and better weather, agricultural output increased substantially in 1971 and
further in 1972. Past investments, particularly in irrigation works, will
permit expansion of production, and domestic and foreign markets could ab-
sorb more than is presently produced. The sector's future development will
depend on energetic efforts to improve methods and efficiency in production,
and on increased training.
8.        Tunisia's crude oil production (primarily from the El Borma fields
in the South) was above four million tons in 1971 providing about 25 percent
of merchandise exports. It has tended to level off since 1969, but recently
intensified prospecting has led to the discovery of new deposits near Sfax
and in the Gulf of Gabes, which are expected to raise production to about
6 million tons per year by 1974. On the other hand, prospects for increas-
ing phosphate production beyond the present level of about 3 million tons



-3-
per year are uncertain, primarily because of high production costs; the
Government is trying to reorganize the industry and to put it on a competi-
tive basis.
9.        Manufacturing contributes about 15 percent to GDP.   Up to 1969,
sector development focussed primarily on import substitution by state enter-
prises and processing of minerals for export. Because of the small domestic
market and difficulty of increasing exports, output grew slowly. Tunisia's
proximity to Europe, low cost and relatively abundant labor and the 1969 As-
sociation Agreement with the EEC, which allows duty free access to the Com-
munity for most Tunisian industrial exports, favor the development of export
industries. Recent import liberalization has given larger scope to private
initiative in industry and should help foster domestic competition; further-
more, legislation providing substantial incentives for domestic and foreign
investments in export-oriented industries has recently been passed. There
appear to be good prospects for foreign investments and sub-contracting which
could make a significant contribution to future industrial development. The
Government now places high importance on the development of industry in its
broadest sense as the main source of future growth and employment.
10.       Tourism started from a low level and expanded rapidly in the 1960's.
It has now become a major foreign exchange earner (about $110 million in 1971,
corresponding to about 25 percent of total current foreign exchange earnings),
source of employment and means of diversifying the economy. Demand is expected
to expand further but hotel capacity is a major constraint on increased ac-
tivity.
11.       The current economic recovery should finally raise average annual
growth of GDP during the current Plan period (1969-72) to a rate close to,
or even larger than the Plan target of 6.5 percent. Total investment over
the Plan period is expected to be about D670 million compared with the Plan
target of D617 million.
12.       The 1973/76 Plan is now under preparation.   The GDP projected for
1976 would require an average growth rate of 5 percent per year with 1972
as a base year. As noted in paragraph 4 above, however, 1972 was an excep-
tional year and after making adjustments for this, the Plan's targets are
equivalent to an average 6-1/2 percent annual growth rate. To achieve this
growth the Plan provides for investment totalling D1,000 million. This is
an ambitious goal depending on the success of new efforts to identify and
prepare production-oriented projects and give the private sector the re-
sources required for its key role. The Government estimates the future
capital inflow needed at about 20 percent of the cost of investment. This
is not out of line with the present high level of external aid, but does not
make adequate allowance for repayments on external debt which will preempt
as much as 30 percent of gross external borrowing over the next few years.
A further problem remains of mobilizing the increased volume of domestic
savings required to finance the remaining 80 percent of investment cost.



13.       The main sources of external aid have been the members of the
Consultative Group for Tunisia. During 1962-1971, the country received
(in terms of actual disbursements) external official aid in the amount of
about US$789 million, about 90 percent of which was granted by bilateral
donor countries and agencies (mainly USAID, France, Federal Republic of
Germany, Canada, Italy, Sweden, and the Kuwait Fund for Arab Economic
Development) and 10 percent by multilateral sources (primarily the Bank
Group and, to a lesser extent, the U.N. and the African Development Bank).
Hlowever, there has been a considerable increase in the proportion of multi-
lateral aid over the period from about 3 percent in 1962-65 to 15 percent
in 1966-71. Of total aid received, 28 percent was in the form of grants,
including agricultural commodities and technical assistance, 30 percent in
the form of non-project loans and 42 percent in project loans. The largest
share of project loans was for irrigation infrastructure (about US$100 mil-
lion), followed by transport and communications (about UJS$87 million) and
tourism (about US$80 million).   The average terms of borrowings in 1971 from
public sources were 4% interest, 22 years maturity and 6 years of grace.
Long term public debt outstanding at the end of 1971 was $917 million, of
xwhich $610 million were disbursed. Of the total, bilateral aid amounted to
$546 million, international organizations $154 million, private banks $117
million, suppliers credits $88 million, and the remainder $12 million was
from miscellaneous sources.
14.       Tunisia's foreign dlebt service burden ($74.3 million in 1971) is
still relatively high; however, restraint in short and medium-term borrowing,
substantial foreign aid on favorable conditions, and the marked improvement
in foreign exchange earnings reduced the debt service ratio from 22 percent
in 1970 to 19.4 percent in 1971. Tunisia's creditworthiness for borrowing
on conventional terms continues to depend on her ability to attract a sub-
stantial portion of external assistance on concessional terms. The Consul-
tative Group for Tunisia, which met in October 1972, welcomed the improvement
in Tunisia's economic performance and agreed that the country needs continued
assistance on concessional terms which the members of the Group expressed
their willingness to provide.
PART II - BANK GROUP OPERATIONS
15.       Beginning with a credit of $5 million for an education project
in 1962, Tunisia has to date received a total of fifteen Bank loans and
nine IDA credits amounting to, respectively, $141.6 million and $58.7 mil-
lion, net of cancellations and refundings. The proposed loan would bring
the total to $215.0 million.
16.       The largest share of Bank Group lending has been for transport.
Two lending operations for po1-t construction, one for the railway company,
one for road construction and one for a gas pipeline account for 32 percent
of the Bank Group's present commitment in Tunisia. Public utilities come
second (18 percent) including two operations for water supply and one for



-5-
power generation and distribution, followed by industrial and hotel finan-
cing through Societe Nationale d'Investissement - SNI (17 percent), tourism
infrastructure (12 percent), agriculture and fisheries (9 percent), educa-
tion (9 percent), and family planning (3 percent).
17.       IFC has invested in a fertilizer plant, in SNI, and in COFITOUR,
a tourism development company. Its net commitments presently held in these
enterprises total US$11.3 million.
18.       Annex II contains a Summary Statement of Bank loans, IDA credits
and IFC investments as of November 30, 1972, and notes on the execution of
ongoing projects. While in the first years of cooperation with Tunisia the
Bank Group's lending primarily aimed at investments in infrastructure, its
focus is now on immediately productive investment in industry, tourism, and
agriculture, with emphasis on increasing foreign exchange earnings and em-
ployment. In agriculture, Bank Group assistance will help to put to full
use existing irrigation infrastructure through financing of on-farm invest-
ment programs, which will be combined with extension and marketing services;
also it will support the Government's endeavors to improve rural living and
employment conditions and to discourage rural migration. Continued lending
for industrial and hotel credit through the proposed loan to SNI and other
operations should help to build up the country's foreign exchange earning
capacity and assist the Government's efforts to increase employment oppor-
tunities in industry and tourism. The shift in the focus of Bank Group
lending is in keeping with the Government's new economic policies and de-
velopment strategy described in Part I of this report.
19.       An urban transport project with an important technical assistance
component for urban transport and land use planning is being prepared. Proj-
ects in agriculture (irrigation rehabilitation, livestock and rural develop-
ment in rainfed and irrigated areas), tourism training, industry (phosphates),
and urbanization (urban sewerage) are also at varying stages of preparation
for lending during the next two years. IFC is contemplating an equity in-
vestment of about $1.0 million for the expansion of a phosphoric acid plant
in Gabes. It is also interested in financing hotel investment possibly
jointly with SNI and COFITOUR.
PART III - THE SECTOR AND THE PROJECT
Industry
20.       Mlanufacturing contributes about 15 percent to GDP.  The develop-
ment of the sector has focussed, to a large extent, on import substitution
and processing of minerals for export. Several reasons accounted for the
slow growth of the manufacturing industry such as the small size of the
domestic market; comprehensive government control over investment decisions,
trade, foreign exchange transactions and prices; and poor management of
public enterprises.



- 6 -
21.       Until 1970, Tunisia chose to rely for its industrial development
on the public sector and government initiatives. The industrial sector was
virtually reserved to government enterprises and a large number of them were
created. The Government extended its control over the sector by acquiring
foreign-owned concerns through purchase or nationalization. The relative
importance of the private sector declined and most of its activity became
concentrated in small and medium-scale activities. Private sector confi-
dence in its role was undernined and private initiative suffered accordingly.
22.       The new economic policies adopted by the Government in 1970 to
stimulate industrial growth through the private sector have begun to show
positive results, although a major contributing factor to the increases in
industrial output of 9% in 1971 and 26% in 1972 was the exceptional level
of the agricultural harvest which led to marked increases in food process-
ing. Opportunities exist for the modernization and expansion of existing
industries (i.e. textiles, ]ight engineering and other light industries) as
well as for the creation of new export-oriented ventures. However, progress
in developing manufacturing industry will depend to a large extent on the
success of the Government's policy of liberalizing the conditions affecting
domestic and foreign investment and on its willingness to undertake an active
promotion program. The creation of a suitable economic environment still
calls for regulations on industrial activity to be further relaxed, invest-
ment procedures simplified, the role of the banks in allocating credit
strengthened and the list of liberalized imports extended. The present
procedure for project identification and preparation and promotion also
need strengthening. Nevertheless, the improved investment climate should
help exploit the growth potential of the industrial sector and lead to an
increasing demand for long-term industrial financing in the country.
Tourism
23.       The development of tourism is a recent phenomenon.    Unusually fast
growth over the period 1962-,71 has averaged 34%, to become the largest source
of foreign exchange earnings ($100 million in 1971) as well as an important
source of direct and indirect employment. The prospects for continued rapid
expansion are bright and plars have been laid to expand hotel capacity accord-
ingly. The Government actively supports tourism development through incentives
to private hotel promoters and has recently embarked on a long-term tourism
infrastructure program which is partly financed by German bilateral aid and
by a Bank loan and an IDA credit approved by the Executive Directors last
June.
24.       SNI represents the major source of long-term local currency and
untied foreign exchange funds for Tunisian private entrepreneurs in tourism
and in the manufacturing sector which the Government is seeking to encourage.
The proposed fifth Bank loan would enable SNI to continue this role.
The Project
25.       An appraisal report on Societe Nationale d'Investissement (No.
17a-TUN) dated December 29, 1972 is being distributed separately. A Loan
and Project Summary is attached as Annex III.



-7-
Establishment and Resources of SNI
26.       Societe Nationale d'Investissement (SNI) was established in 1959
and reorganized in 1965 with the assistance of the Bank Group. After doubling
its share capital in January 1971 to D3.0 million, ownership distribution is
as follows: Tunisian public sector (government and state-controlled enter-
prises) 22.2 percent, Tunisian private sector 42.7 percent, foreign share-
holders 35.1 percent including IFC, which holds a 20 percent participation.
The Bank has so far made four loans to SNI, $5 million in Mlay 1966 (No. 449).
$10 million in September 1967 (No. 512), $10 million in December 1969 (No.
648), and $10 million in January 1972 (No. 798). The Swedish International
Development Agency (SIDA) has made two long-term loans to SNI, totalling
US$9 million. In addition, SNI obtained about D1.1 million from banks and
the Government of Tunisia. In 1964/65, at the time of the reorganization,
the Government also provided SNI with a DO.5 million grant, and in 1966 made
an interest-free loan of D615,000 which is subordinated to all other debt.
Local borrowing from other Tunisian institutions has amounted to D455,000.
Objectives and Role of SNI
27.       SNI's policies established at the time of its reorganization in
1965 provide that SNI is to stimulate industrialization and the development
of tourism in Tunisia through the financing of sound and productive projects.
SNI also seeks to help develop the capital market and, in particular, to
broaden the securities market.
28.       From 1966 to the end of 1970, SNI approved 211 loans and equity
investments amounting to D21.6 million. SNI almost doubled the volume of
its annual approvals from D3.7 million in 1968 to D6.7 million in 1970.
Approvals slowed down during 1971 to D6.4 million due in part to the gen-
erally high level of liquidity in the economy resulting from a bumper crop
and increased tourism receipts; however, in 1972, loan approvals increased
sharply to a record of over D10 million.
29.       SNI's financial assistance has been mainly in the form of loans,
with equity investments accounting for only 15% of total portfolio. Mlaturities
have ranged up to fourteen years (which has proved too short for hotel finan-
cing in some cases). In future, SNI proposes to extend loans to hotels for
up to 20 years, including up to 5 years' grace, if justified in the individual
case by the forecast financial position of the borrower and the expected life-
time of the assets. SNI charges 9 percent interest. Interest rates of other
Tunisian banks range from 6 to 8-1/2 percent for medium-term credits, yet,
despite its 9 percent rate, SNI has been able to find a market because its
loans are long-term and not tied to procurement from specific countries.
Moreover, the foreign exchange risk on loans provided from Bank and SIDA
resources has been borne by the Government.
30.       SNI's equity investments total D2 million, which is well below
the limit set forth in its Statement of Policies, i.e. the equivalent of
its net worth. The most important single equity investment (D830,000) was
SNI's subscription to COFITOUR (Compagnie Financiere et Touristique), in
which also IFC is a principal investor.



- 8 -
31.       SNI has been active in financing manufacturing and tourism.    Its
share in financing total industrial investment in the country increased from
5 percent in 1969 to an estimated 22 percent in 1972, while its share in
tourism financing grew from 14 percent to an estimated 19 percent over the
same period.
32.       Through the projects it has financed in tourism and industry, SNI
has helped to substantially enlarge Tunisia's foreign exchange earning ca-
pacity. The tourism sector accounts for about 50 percent of SNI's loans
outstanding. In the manufacturing sector, 20 percent of SNI's funds have
gone to enterprises exporting over half of their production. As the Govern-
ment increases its incentives for exports, SNI should be in a position to
further expand its activity in this field. Until 1969, SNI did not finance
public sector enterprises as a matter of policy. However, by 1971, public
sector enterprises were receiving 32 percent of SMI's loans to industry,
while for 1972 the percentage is forecast to decline slightly. SNI's policy
statement limits the amount of such lending to 25 percent of total outstand-
ing commitments.
33.       Despite increasing operations and scarcity of experienced staff,
SNI has assisted small and medium-sized industrial enterprises and is now
giving increased attention to applications for loans to such enterprises.
There is a growing number of small and medium-sized enterprises which, partly
as a result of the Government's new economic policies, are looking to SNI for
their investment financing needs.
34.       A pressing issue facing the Tunisian economy is unemployment.
SNI's operations have to some extent contributed to alleviating this prob-
lem in manufacturing and tourism.   SNI estimates that its industrial proj-
ects financed since 1970 have added about 2,900 jobs at a cost of $14,300
per job. Another 4,400 jobs were created through tourism investments over
the same period at a cost of about $13,500 per job.
Organization
35.       Board of Directors and Management.    SNI's Board of Directors has
14 members. Mr. Habib Bourguiba Jr. was elected President-Director General
in March 1971 to replace Mr. Moncef Belkodja, who stayed on as Director with
special executive powers (Administrateur Delegue). At the June 1972 General
Assembly the following changes were introduced in the Board: four directors,
instead of three, were elected to represent SNI's private shareholders, while
the number of Directors repretsenting the Government and public sector insti-
tutions was reduced from six to five. Mr. Khosropur is representing IFC on
SNI's Board since 1969. Mr. Bourguiba fell ill in December 1971 and since
he is still convalescing, Mlr. Moncef Belkodja together with Mr. Fakfak, the
Deputy General Director appointed in June 1971, are presently managing the
company.
36.       Staff and Procedures.   SNI's weak organization and operational
performance was a matter of concern when the last Bank loan was made in
January 1972. At that time, it was decided to cover the foreign exchange



-9-
needs of SNI for only one year while a number of corrective measures were
proposed. Based primarily on the detailed recommendations of an expert from
the International Executive Corps, and on considerable technical assistance
from the Caisse Centrale de Cooperation Economique (a shareholder), and with
advice from the Bank, SNI has since been carrying out a reorganization to
improve its project appraisal work as well as its follow-up and promotional
capacity. To that effect additional staff has been recruited and a more
efficient division of work through new procedures and organizational struc-
ture has been set up; it has also strengthened its follow-up division but
more staff, particularly engineers, are still needed. The Bank continues to
pay close attention to the effectiveness of these measures.
37.       The quality of SNI's project appraisals has improved markedly
since last year. Its project analysis deals satisfactorily with the tech-
nical, financial, and economic aspects of industrial projects. Appraisals
of large hotel projects still need improvement, and SNlI is planning to em-
ploy jointly with COFITOUR experienced staff for tourism project appraisal
work. The economic justification of SNIt's projects will also be reviewed
in mid-1973 in the light of the findings of a Bank mission from the Opera-
tions Evaluation Division, presently in the field.
Financial Results
38.       Net earnings for 1971 were about D253,O0O equivalent to 8.6 per-
cent on the year-end shlare capital. 1971 profits alnost doubled those of
1970, mainly because interest earned on loans and deposits rose by 43 per-
cent while interest expense increased only by 39 percent. SNI paid a 6
percent dividend on both 1970 and 1971 results.
39.       Total assets grew steeply from D6 million in 1967 to nearly D15
million at the end of 1970 and D18 million in 1971. SNI's financial posi-
tion at the end of 1971 was considered sound and its liquidity strong, with
net working capital of over Dl million. SNI's debt/equity ratio as defined
in the loan agreements with the Bank stood at the end of 1971 at about 2:1
against a limit of 4:1.
40.       SNlI's portfolio of loans and investments is basically sound, but
there are problems. The difficulty of validating mortgage security on cer-
tain loans continues, though there has been progress in the past year.
Principal and interest overdue three months or more represents 3.2 percent
of loan portfolio at the end of 1971, and has dropped to 2.6 percent at the
end of November 1972. Over three-fourths of the arrears are on hotel loans
and reflect both the starting up difficulties of somewhat inexperienced hotel
borrowers and relatively short grace and repayment periods of SNI's hotel
loans hitherto.  These arrears should diminish substantially given the very
good results of the 1971 and 1972 tourist seasons and the bright prospects
of this sector.
41.       SNI's reorganization of its supervision and collection activities
should result in an improvement of the portfolio. Moreover, in its 1972
accounts, SN1 plans to increase loan provisions and to continue to work in



- 10 -
close collaboration with the Government to get adequate mortgage security
on its loans.
42.       In summary, in spite of a few problem cases for which SNI is seeking
an adequate solution, SNI portfolio of loans and equity investments appears
to be sound. It should also be recognized that SNI has a comfortable cushion
of reserves and surplus amounting to D 1.1 million, of which D 800,000 are
free reserves; in addition, there is the Government grant of D 500,000. Al-
though this cushion is part of SNI's net worth and cannot be considered as
provision against potential losses, these amounts nevertheless indicate that
SNI is in a strong overall financial position and is creditworthy.
Projected Operations and Resource Requirements
43.       Forecast of Operat:Lons.  Estimates of SNI's projected operations
are based for the immediate future on projects already under preparation,
and for the following years on general prospects for industry and tourism
development as defined by the Government's objectives for the next Plan
period (1973-1976).
44.       SNI has good business prospects.   Although approvals in 1973 are
likely to be somewhat down from the exceptionally high record of 1972, ap-
provals over the period 1974-77, are expected to increase by at least 5-6%
per year. To finance this program, SNI will need fresh resources early in
1973.
45.       The proposed loan would cover SNI's resource gap for two years.
Presently available resources for import financing (D1.2 million) will be
fully committed by February 1973. To meet import commitments through the
end of 1974, SNI will need additional D8.5 million. Current negotiations
of SNI with the Government for a share in bilateral aid available from
Sweden (SIDA) and Germany (KFW) should provide SNI with D0.6 million and
D1.4 million respectively, to finance imports. The remaining import finan-
cing gap would amount to D6.5 million or about $14.0 million, which would
be covered by the proposed Bank loan. SNI expects to meet its local currency
financing needs from self-generated funds, a portion of SIDA funds available
for local currency financing, the proceeds from a proposed domestic bond
issue, and a possible share capital increase in 1974.
46.       SNI's earnings prospects are reasonably good.    Profits before taxes
are projected to increase from 9.7 percent on average net worth in 1971 to
13.2 percent in 1977, which would make it possible for SNI, in a few years,
to distribute dividends higher than the 6 percent paid out in the last two
years.
Terms of the Proposed Bank Loan
47.       The proposed loan to SNI follows the terms and conditions of recent
Bank loans to development finance companies, including the standard commit-
ment charge. The free limit up to which no Bank approval of a sub-loan is
required would be raised from US$200,000 to US$400,000, with an aggregate
amount of US$4.0 million. This would be justified in view of SNI's improved



appraisal standards, the generally larger size of its sub-projects, higher
costs resulting from price increases, and particularly higher costs of im-
ports from Western Europe in terms of dollars following last year's currency
realignment. The debt equity limit of 4:1 as defined in previous loan agree-
ments would be retained. Loans to hotel projects financed out of the proposed
Bank loan could if necessary be extended up to 20 years while financing of
industrial projects would be limited, as in previous loans, to 15 years.
48.       SNI is, with the Bank Group's assistance, continuing its important
role in the Tunisian economy. It has experienced difficulties in its organ-
ization and staff, but the remedial measures which were introduced or are
being implemented should enable the company to cope with the growing tasks
ahead. SNI is considered creditworthy for the additional financing proposed.
PART IV - LEGAL INSTRUMENTS AND AUTHORITY
49.       The draft Loan Agreement between the Bank and SNI, the draft Guar-
antee Agreement between the Republic of Tunisia and the Bank, the Report of
the Committee provided for in Article III, Section 4(iii) of the Articles of
Agreement and the text of a resolution approving the proposed loan are being
distributed to the Executive Directors separately. The draft agreements con-
form to the normal pattern for loans for development finance companies.
50.       I am satisfied that the proposed loan would comply with the
Articles of Agreement of the Bank.
PART V - RECOMMENDATION
51.       I recommend that the Executive Directors approve the proposed
loan.

C. PROJECTS IN EXEGUTION1/
Second Education Project; US$13 million credit of September 16, 1L966
Closing Date: December 5L971i
Following approval of the memorandum to the Executive Directors of
August 21, 1971 (IDA/R71-57) part of the remaining proceeds of this credit
was allocated to finance additional equipment for a number of existing
schools and technical assistance in educational planning. Procurement pro-
cedures for equipment have already been initiated and recruitement of most
educational planning experts is taking place. It is expected that the credit
will be fully disbursed by the above Closing Date.
Cooperative Farms Project: US$6 million credit and US$12 million loan both
of February 21, 1967; Closing Date: December 31, 1973.
A detailed account of the problems encountered in implementing
this project was contained in a memorandium to the Executive Directors on
November 5, 1970 (R70-213).   The Executive Directors approved amendments
to the original Loan and Credit Agreements on November 17, 1970. These
amendments became effective on March 2h, 1971, and disbursements were
resumed. The project is now nearing completion. The Closing Date for the
technical assistance com)onent of the Project is December 31, 1973 and March
31, 1973 for the other categories. It is now expected that the Loan and
Credit will be fully disbursed by December 31, 1973.
Port Development Project; US$8.5 million loan of November 29, 196u; Closing
Date: December 31, 1973.
Execution of this project has been generally satisfactory. Total
cost of the project is now estimated at $13.2 million, as compared to the
appraisal estimate of $10.7 million although the foreign exchange component
remains at $8.5 million. The increased cost is due mainly to unexpected
price increases and to unforeseen soils conditions which also delayed cons-
truction activities and required a one-year extension of the Closing Date.
The loan is expected to be fully disbursed by the revised Closing Date of
December 31, 1973.
Water Supply I and II Projects; US$l1 million loan of January 16, 1969 and
US$10.6 million credit of June 30, 1970, respectively; Closing Date: December
31, 1973 and December 31, 1974, respectively.
The construction pace of the first project has accelerated after a
late start and is now proceeding sa-tisfactorily.   Total cost of project is
expected to be $1.6 million less than the appraisal estimate and the foreign
exchange component to be $2.) million lower; these savings may be applied to
finance the foreign exchange component of further distribution works to be
carried out by the water authority. The second project has now entered the
phase of active bidding, and disbursements are expected to start shortly.

Railways Project: US$8.5 million credit and US$8.5 million loan both of
June h. 1969: Closing Date: December 31, 1973.
Execution of this project is facing difficulties. The problems, mainly
financial, are due to (a) non-payment of freight charges by the railway's largest
customer, the state-controlled SFAX-GAFSA Phosphate Company; (b) operational
deficits due to low rates and fares, and (c) higher than estimated purchase price
of rolling stock. Government has agreed that the Phosphate Company's freight
bills will be paid, and that it will revise rail tariffs on completion of a
current transport cost and tariffs study.
It is proposed that the additional costs of rolling stock will be
absorbed by credit facilities offered by the Spanish Government. Because of
procedural delays in calling tenders and awarding contracts for this procurement,
as well as for needed replacement track, physical completion of the project will
be delayed more than a year to early 1975, necessitating about 18 months post-
ponement of the Closing date from December 31, 1973 to July 31, 1975.
Gas Pipeline Pro.iect: US$7.5 million loan of February 25, 1971; Closing Date:
December 31, 1973.
Execution of this project has been satisfactory and all work is nearly
completed. The increase in project costs from US$13.6 million (US$10 million
foreign) to US$l14.7 million (US$10.4 million foreign) is due mainly to the
effects of the US dollar devaluation, only US$0.4 million being caused by
increased quantities of work. The loan should be fully disbursed well before
the Closing Date.
Population Project: US$4.8 million credit of April 5 1971; Closing Date:
June 30, 1976.
Execution of this project has had a slow start mostly due to difficulties
encountered in setting up the project organization and to the inadequate coordi-
nation among the various Government agencies involved. Most of these problems
have recently been overcome and it is now hoped that the project will move ahead
as planned. Expenditures for an amount of $0.7 million have been incurred and
disbursement applications are being processed.
Highways Project: US$24 million loan of June 9. 1971; Closing Date: June 30, 1976.
Execution of this project is generally satisfactory. Disbursements are
six months behind schedule due partly to delay in project execution and to lack
of a provision to pay contractor mobilization costs. The foreign exchange costs
of the project , payable mostly in French Francs, have increased in US dollar
terms by about 5 percent as a result of the recent currency realignments.

Agricultural Credit Project; US$3 million credib and US$5 million loan.
both of July 12, 1971; Closing Date: September -0, 197'.
Ececution of this project is satisfactory. Disbursements were
slightly behincd schedule at the initial stage of the project but are expected
to catch up.
Fisheries Project; US$2 million credit of September 24. 1971; Closing Date:
December 31, 1976.
This credit became effective six months behind schedule on May 24,
1972, due to the difficulties encountered in recruiting foreign experts for
the project. Now that thesE experts are on the job, including the project
manager, execution is expected to progress satisfactorily.
lFower Project; US$12 million, loan of April 20, 1972; Closing Date: July 31,1975.
This loan became effective on August 4, 1972 and it is proceeding on
schedule. Bidding for the major items of the project is in progress.
Tourism Infrastructure Project; US$10 million credit andi. U5$14 million loan,
both of September 28, 1972; Closing Date: December 31 1977.
This loan and credit were signed on September 28, 1972.   The related
Lenders'Agreement between the Bank and KfUi, which is contributing DM 40 million
to the project, was signed on October 26, 1972, and it is expected that the
other conditions of effectiveness will be met before the terminal date of
M4arch 1, 1973.
2/ These notes are designed to inform the Executive Directors regarding
the progress of projects in execution, and in particular to report any
problems which are being encountered, and the action being taken to
remedy them. They should be read in this sense, and with the understanding
that they do not purport to present a balanced evaluation of strength and
weaknesses in project execution.
