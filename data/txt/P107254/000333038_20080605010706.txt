I. STRATEGICCONTEXTANDRATIONALE

A. Country and Sector Issues

1.       Eritrea i s located along the RedSea, north o fthe Horn o f Africa, betweenDjibouti and
Sudan. Eritrea's longest border i s sharedwith Ethiopia to the south. Since the resumption of
conflict with Ethiopiain 1998, there has been an impasse inthe transition to a market-based
economy. Client commitment to the necessary reforms has beenuneven over the course o fthe
ISNperiod (ISN2005-07, ReportNo.31665-ER) as the border dispute with Ethiopia remained
unresolved. Under the recent ISNthat was submitted to the Boardon May 20,2008 (ISN2009-
10, Report no. 42930), the Bank shifted focus to maximize improved service delivery through
the existing portfolio andplannedanalytical work. The strategy rests on two pillars: (a) support
human development and (b) support basic infrastructuredevelopment. The proposedoperation
i s consistent with the strategy outlined inthe I S Nwhich supports one new project to sustain
gains made inearly childhood development.

2.       Economic conditions remain challenging as a result o f the external environment,
macroeconomic situation and limited physical and humancapital.                    Although there has been
significant fiscal consolidation since the end o f the border war, the fiscal deficit is still highat 10
percent o f GDP, and the resulting macroeconomic imbalances continue to be managed through
regulations and price controls. Annual per capita growth has been negative since the border war,
reversingthe gains made between 1993 and 1997, andreturning real per capita incomes to pre-
independence levels, making Eritrea one o f the poorest countries inthe worlda2Inflation remains
inthe doubledigits, buthas decelerated from 18.5 percent at end- 2005 to anestimated 12.3
percent at end- 2007. The risk o fmacroeconomic instability, the use o fprice controls,
regulations and rationing, particularly o f foreign exchange, create an unfavorable business
environment. There was an economic contraction in2006 as manufacturing and construction
sector activities slowed inresponse to shortages o f foreign exchange. Renewedmining sector
activity and a reboundinconstruction and service sector activities resulted ina positive growth
rate o f 1.3 percent in2007. Inaddition to continuing to correct fiscal imbalances, GoE indicated
duringthe InternationalMonetaryFund's Article IV mission that it would consider steps to
correct external imbalances in2008. Despite the weak overall economic performance, the
Government support for the social sectors has remained strong and World Bank assistancehas
achieved positive results inthe health and early childhood and education sectors. However,
risingworld food and oil prices couldreverse the marginal 2007 economic improvement.

3.       Poverty data needs updating. The last household survey andParticipatory Poverty
Assessment (PPA) undertakenin2003 estimated around two thirds o f the population were living
below the poverty line. Although the reliability o fthe estimate i s questionable (e.g. data showed
favorable agriculture production following a bad drought year in2003), it i s fair to assume that
povertyrates are very high. Despiterelativelygood harvests inthe last two years, the prices o f
essential food items andcereals have been increasing, possibly as a result o fhigher global food
prices. Undernutrition prevalence i s high,with over 50 percent of under-five children stunted

'    The economic assessment draws upon the IMFArticle IV Staff Report and Selected Issues paper, January 2008.
     Even leaving aside the years directly affected by the conflict, medianper capita growth was -3.3 percent for the
     period 2001 to 2006, compared to 7.4 percent inthe period 1993 to 1997.

and 13percent underweight for their age. Women remain among the most disadvantaged.
Forty-seven percent o fhouseholds are headedby women, half o f these are widows as a result of
Eritrea's turbulent history, and they are overwhelmingly poor - as highas 85 percent according
to the PPA. There has been limitedprogress toward achieving the MillenniumDevelopment
Goals (MDGs), but gains havebeenmade inindicators o fhealth and to some extent education
outcomes where development partners have continued to provide support.

Sector Issues-Health, Nutritionand Food Security. Education andEarly Childhood
Development

Health

4.       The Health Sector plays the most fundamental role instrengtheninga country's human
resources, especially the healthy development o f its young children. Since independence, Eritrea
has made admirable progress inimprovingthe health o f its people, especially inmalaria,
HIV/AIDS and child survival. Malaria morbidity andmortality have beenreduced more than 80
percent since 1999 given good control efforts, makingEritrea one o f few Sub-Saharan Africa
(SSA) countries to have met the Abuja RollBack Malaria targets. HIVprevalence inEritreai s
relatively low at 2.4 percent o f the adult population, compared to the SSA average o f 7 percent.
According to the Demographic and Health surveys (DHS), between 1995 and 2002, infant
mortality fell dramatically from 72 to 48 deaths per 1,000 livebirths, andunder-fivemortality
fell from 136 to 93 deaths per 1,000 live births. Around 76 percent o f children aged 12-23
months are fully immunized. The upcoming 2008 DHS will confirm whether these
improvements have continued.

5.       Despite such achievements, several health challenges remain. Child health improvement
is still an unfinishedagenda. While there have been dramatic reductions ininfantandunder-five
mortality as discussed above, the neonatal mortality rate remains around 25 per 1,000 live births
for the last decade. Poor access to safe water and sanitation contributes to diarrhea, which i s the
leading cause o f illness inchildren. Maternal healthis another challenge. There are different
estimates for maternalmortality ratio (MMR), a more recent estimate i s 450 per 100,000, which
i s high.Disparity inreproductive health outcomes i s large, with maternal mortality ratio many
times higherinremote areas such as the Southern RedSearegion than inthe capital city o f
Asmara. While 40 percent ofpregnant women have the fourth antenatal visit, only 30 percent
deliver ina health facility. The majority o f deliveries (70 percent) are conducted at home by non-
medicalpersonnel. The rate o fhealth facility deliveries is muchhigher inurbanareas (62
percent) thaninrural areas (8.6 percent). The GoE has a strategy under implementationto
address these issues, supported inlargepart byHIV/AIDS, Malaria, STD, Tuberculosis Control
and Reproductive Health (HAMSET) Iand 11.

Nutrition and Food Security

6.       Malnutrition i s a major concern inEritrea. Data collected at the end o f 2006 for the final
evaluation for the previous Integrated EarlyChildhood Development (IECD) project estimated
that 42 percent o f children < 3 years old were malnourished, o fwhich 13 percent were severely
(<3 standard deviations) underweight.



                                                   2

7.      Causes o fmalnutritioninyoung children include both its `immediate' determinants such
as child health andnutrition practices as well as the broader context o f food security/food
availability. The (IECD) Project implementedinEritrea showed that food security problems can
dampenthe overall impact o fhealthandnutrition interventions; andthat any reversal would
require both additional efforts at the local level through programs such as Growth Monitoring
andPromotion (GMP) andthe needto address food security issues.

8.      Some 40 percent o fthe Eritreanpopulation is estimated to be chronically food insecure
due to the cumulative effects o frepeated droughts, deforestation, and soil erosion and
degradation. Despite relatively good harvests inthe last two years, the prices o f essential food
itemsandcereals havebeen increasing possibly the impact ofhigherglobal foodprices. Global
                                               -
food prices have risen by 26 percent inthe last three years, and along with other resource-poor,
small SSA countries, Eritreahas suffered a significant terms o ftrade shock as a result of
commodity price changes (the size o f the shock i s estimated to be 10percent o f GDP). Eritrea's
food security strategy attempts to mitigate the impact on householdconsumptionthrough
centrally managed food suppliesandrationed availability o fbasic commodities at fixed prices.
Wheat, sorghum, andbarley canbe sold only to the GoE, and are therefore subject to price
controls. Fair price shops sell sorghum, sugar, beans, oil, tea, and pasta, which are rationed for
eligible residents based on family size. It i s important to emphasize that there i s no independent
assessmento f the success o fthis strategy. The GoE and European Commission (EC) have
recently agreed to a new program o f support focused on food security/rural development, road
infrastructure andregional connections, and capacity building. Overall, food security remains a
major risk inEritrea, and is a specific concern for this proposed follow-on operation.

9.      Inlinewith internationalbestpractice, the Governmenthas adopted atwo-pronged
strategy to deal with malnutrition issues:

        (a) The Government has a strong program, with the support o fthe World Health
            Organization (WHO) and the UnitedNation's Children Fund(UNICEF), to help
            address issues o f community nutrition, including GMP. The program i s aimed at
            engaging families and communities to help prevent severe malnutrition (for children
            who are moderatelymalnourished) through educational programshehavioral change
            andhelprefer severely malnourishedchildren to healthunits for community-based
            therapeutic and supplemental feeding.

        (b) Inaddition, food security is a government priority. The FoodSecurity Strategy, 2003,
            aims to make "food o f sufficient quantity and acceptable quality readily accessible to
            all at an affordable price at any time and place within the country." To lower aid-
            dependence, a cash-for-work policy was introducedin2006 to replace free
            distribution o f food aid. Since the cash-for-work programs were introduced, food aid
            has effectively ceased. A Grain Board and a Crop EarlyWarning system have been
            established to manage food supplies. The Boardhas intervenedinthe market for
            food intimes o f scarcity, to stem price increases and i s expected to hold sufficient
            stocks so that intimes o f drought, food can be supplied immediately from domestic

 GMP is, a community-based approachthat helps prevent andtreat malnutrition inyoung childrenthroughboth
educatiodtraining and therapeutic feeding interventions.


                                                        3

             sources. A Food Security Fundwas also set up to ensure that the government could
             purchase an additional three months worth of food on the world market to supplement
             the stocks kept by the GrainBoard.

Education

 10.     Inthe EducationSector, primaryschool attendanceincreasedrapidlyfollowing
independence, but currently only 50 percent o f children complete primary school, compared to a
SSA average o f 57 percent. Onthe supply side there are insufficient numbers o fprimary
schools, textbooks, andtrained teachers to ensure that quality education can be provided. On
the demand side, a large nomadic populationposesparticular challenges facing the authorities
for getting all children into school. The GoE recognizes that the development o fhumancapital
will be critical for future economic prospects. The IECDprogramwill help addressbothsupply
anddemandside challenges bypromotingyoung children's healthy growth, better development
o f language abilities andsocial skills thus improving their school readiness.

Early ChildhoodEducation and Development

 11.     Enrolment inpreschools (four and five year olds) i s limited but has increased
substantially  - by about six times over the period 2000-06 - and net enrolment rose from about
4.5 percent to 19 percent, owing largely to a strong community-based approach. Inaddition,
owing insome part to the government program, there was a substantial decrease inrepetition and
dropout rates inGrade 1. Inspite o f this achievement, there i s a vast majority o frural children
who still do not have accessto pre-school andearly childcare. Some development partners such
as UNICEF have continued to provide assistance to the Government inthe area o f ECE policy,
including support on capacity buildingfor ECE policymakingandprogram development.

12.      As part o fits broad-based growth strategy, the GoEregards IECD, andthe psychosocial
protectiono f vulnerable children as a fundamental condition to achieving its long-term
development goals. There i s a keen awareness o fthe importance o f investing inyoung children
andthe long-term economic andsocial returns it can generate. Inline withthisprinciple, the
GoE ratified the convention on the Rights o f the Child (CRC) in 1994. The government
formulated policy guidelines for Early Childhood Education andCare (ECEC) in 1995 and for
Primary Health care, Food security andHIV/AIDSin 1998. Several articles inthe 1997 National
Constitution also affirm the ECD imperative. These sectoral policies culminated inthe
finalization o fthe draft Integrated ECD Policy in2005. With funding from the Education
Program Development Fund(EPDF)the Bank provided the GoE technical assistance to cost the
implementation o fthe program endorsedby the Policy. This preliminary costing exercise
provides the development partners (DPs) with information o f financing gap. The Bank task team
is engaged ina dialogue with the GoE to explore further fiscal space issues and financing
options.

13.      The IECDpolicy also provides a framework o f Government, Regional, Administration,
institution, communities, families and InternationalandNational Development Partners for
investing inand implementing integrated ECD programs that contribute towards realizing the
well-being of young children.



                                                  4

14.     Different ministries are implementingsector-specific policies andprograms related to
ECD:

        (a) The Ministryo f Education (MoE) implements the ECEC policy, supporting equal
            access to andimprovedquality o f ECEC interventions, and the promotion o f cost-
            effective community-based interventions that promote and strengthen community
            responsibility with the intent to achieve sustainability o f interventions.

        (b) The Ministryo fHealth (MOH) hasprepared policy guidelines on food security and
            nutrition that focus on children and mothers because o ftheir observed vulnerability to
            malnutrition.

        (c) The Ministryo f Labor and HumanWelfare (MOLHW) has programs inplace to
            strengthenthe traditional safety nets with a focus on supporting children inneed o f
            special protection, especially orphans.

        (d) Onthe civil society side, the NationalUnion o fEritreanWomen (NUEW) and the
            National Uniono f EritreanYouth (NUEY) are actively engaged inadvocacy efforts
            that promote the rights and well-being o fwomen andchildren.

15.     The GoE recognizes that ECD interventions yield strong and sustainable results when
they are integrated at the community levelwith support from all administrative levels inthe
government. Inthis regard, the National DecentralizationPolicy (ProclamationNo. 86/96 for the
Establishment o fRegionalAdministration) and its framework play a critical role inenhancing
effective ECD implementation. This policy aims to devolve program management responsibility
to regions (zobas), sub-regions (sub-zobas), andcommunities as a means o f improving
performance, financial transparency and accountability, effectiveness and sustainability.

IECD's Achievements and proposed IECD I1

16.    Between2000-2007 the GoE implemented the first phase o f its program o f Integrated
EarlyChildhoodDevelopment (IECD) with support from the World Bank andthe Italian
Cooperation. The development objectives o f IECDwere to: (i)       promote healthy growth and
development o f children under six years o f age; (ii) access to, and improvethe quality of
                                                      expand
services that address the basic needs o f young children; (iii)
                                                              support orphans and children facing
especially difficult circumstances; and (iv) improve health and nutrition o f children inprimary
schools. To achieve the above objectives, the first phase o fthe IECD program targetedpregnant
women andchildren aged six andunder, focusing on Maternal and Child Health andNutrition
services (including selected food security interventions), early stimulation for cognitive
development, EarlyChildhood Education and Care (ECEC). It also provided support for
orphans re-integration and services for vulnerable children inneed o f special protectionup to age
18 years.

17.    The first project, which ended inMarch2007, was successful inachieving most of its
objectives (see Table 1for details).

18.      Table 1shows the achievement o f three out o f four outcome targets. Inaddition, it is
worthy to note that IECD also helpedincrease enrolment inpreschools by about six times over
the base year andnet enrolment went from about 4.5 percent to 19 percent, owing largely to a
strong community-based implementation approach. However, the prevalence o f underweight
children less than three years o f age increased over the IECDproject period due to broader food
security issues causedby a prolonged drought that lasted four years (2002-2005). It started while
the Projectwas beingpreparedanddidnot enduntil2006.

19.      However, the first project also demonstrated that innovations program designcould
produce radically different results. Through the IECD Project the M o Himplemented household
andhouseholdandcommunitybased Integrated Management o f ChildhoodIllnesses (HWC-
I M C Ion a pilot basis    - combined with     GMP activities - andwas able to demonstrate the effect o f
this combined approach inreducingmalnutritionby28 percent inthe pilot area(see Table 2
below). With support from UNICEF, a community based therapeutic feeding program was also
implemented inlimitedscale.

20.     IECD also served as a pilot to fine-tune and hrther develop the mechanisms for
implementing integrated ECD effectively. Inparticular, it illustrated the need for integrated
services delivered at community level and the empowerment o f families and communities for the
long-term sustainability o f the ECD program. This experience provided lessons and insights for
the development o fthe GoE's National IECDPolicy.

21.     After the project closed, the GoE has continued to provide support to the existing
interventions, although integration at the community level has not been scaled up. Government
has retained the implementation arrangements (which are largely mainstreamed). Financial
support to ECEC centers has continued through the ongoing Bank support o f the Education
Sector Investment Project (ESP). Inaddition, UNICEF continuedto provide technical assistance
andsupport inthe area o fparentingeducation training and other children relatedactivities during
thisperiod.

22.     The proposed follow-up operation builds on the strengths o f the previous IECD program.
The focus will be to consolidate and strengthen the integration o f ECD services at the
community level. Inparticular, the proposed second phase will: (i) the focus o f the
                                                                        limit
interventionsto children aged six andunder; (ii)    further consolidate the health andnutrition, and
social protectioninterventionsinthe project villages; (iii)  strengthen ongoing nutrition
interventions, including GMP promotion and an agreement to use the unallocatedamount to
purchase additional therapeutic feedingto mitigate the effects o f food security crisis ifit were to
affect the project areas; and (iv) contribute to the sustainability o fthe IECDprogram inthe target
communities through a grant scheme program.

B. Rationale for Bank Involvement

23.     The international evidence on the link between nutrition and pre-schooling and school
readiness i s strong: weight-for-age (underweight) at age 2 i s a strong predictor o f stunting;
malnutrition inearly years is linkedto 0.7 grades loss o f schooling and seven month delay in
starting school. Malnourishedchildren are more likely to drop out and/or repeat grades, iodine-
deficiency robs children o f 13 IQ  points on average, and anemia reduces performance on
cognitive tests (IQ) by 8 points. For these reasons, early childhood development continues to be
a priority within Government's social sector policies for humanitarianas well as economic
development.

24.     The IECD, launched inSeptember 2000, with support from the World Bank, the Italian
Cooperationandcounterpart funding from the Government o fEritreawas closed on March 31,
2007. The implementation was satisfactory andproject objectives were largely achieved. Ofthe
three self-standing ECD operations o fthis kind in Sub-Saharan Africa recently, Eritrea IECD
stands out for the commitment shownbythe Government and other development partners in
achieving satisfactory results. Moreover, the ImplementationCompletion Report (ICR)
confirmed the current relevance o f IECD's PDO - an assessmentshared by the Internal
Evaluation Group (IEG) and crucial inthe decision to process the proposedoperation as a
repeater. The proposed operationwould help consolidate the achievements made inIECD
through a targeted, integrated program o f support that mitigates the risks identified inthe prior




                                                   7

operation andbuilds on its successes. Itwould `ride on' on the implementationarrangements
that are already inplace andoperational inthe project areas.

25,     IECD also remains an area o f focus for the Development Partners -mainly WHO for
IMCI, andUNICEF for GMP andHWC-IMCI. The Bank's involvement inthe proposed
repeater project provides an opportunity to buildon the lessons from IECD and support the
Government inenhancing the quality anddeepening the integrationo frelevant ECD
interventions intargeted areas. The Bank's comparative advantage inreviewing public sector
financing and sustainability issues i s expected to help the Government to scale up successfidly
effective ECD interventions, without losing sight o f fiscal constraints. IECD I1will also provide
a learning ground for fbture ECD options elsewhere inthe region, as well as an opportunity to
present the achievements o f integrated ECD to other internationalpartners.

26.     The proposed operationmeets the criteria for Bank's new financing inEritrea listed inthe
ISN:
        (a) The Bank has a comparative advantage and a history o f positive engagement and
              results (which IECD demonstrated).

        (b) There is an appropriate sector policy framework inplace, agreement with the GoE
              on the remainingpolicy issues, and a planfor their implementation(including a
              strong IECD Policy).

        (c)   There i s demonstrated willingnessbythe GoE to take on board Bank technical and
              policy advice inthe sector (the GoE has requested such support).

        (d) The results are estimated to be sustainable underrealistic macroeconomic
              projections (but are somewhat mitigatedbythe plannedexperiment with the
              community grant scheme program embedded inthe project design and a plan for
              longer term Bank-government engagement on financing strategies).

        (e)   The project-level risks are considered moderate following mitigation measures
              (confirmed for the current project).

        (f)   The development impact i s expected to be considerable interms o f either direct
              improvements inwell-being or interms o f galvanizing economic growth (confirmed
              for the proposed project, per the positive experience with similar interventions inthe
             previous Eritrea IECDproject and generally acceptedresearch on the benefits o f
             ECD).

27.     The design and implementationo fthe second phase o f the IECDprogram is consistent
with andsupports the Government's IECDPolicy andthe Bank's I S Nfocus onhuman
development. Throughthe longer term impact IECD activities are expected to have on health
and education, IECD I1will contribute to a number o fMDGsrelatingto maternal andchild
health, nutrition, andprimaryeducation as well as poverty reduction. The impact o f this project



                                                  8

i s especially highbecause it focuses on the well-being o f young children, especially those who
are disadvantaged bypoverty andpost-conflict conditions.

28.     Buildingon the successo fIECD, thisproject sets the groundwork for a longterm
scalingup o f ECD throughout Eritrea. By consolidatingthe integrated program intargeted
villages and helpingto ensure their sustainability through optimal Governmental funding and
community participation, the project will pave the way for a large scale replication and scaling
up o fthe programs acrossthe country inthe next sevento ten years. This operation, therefore,
provides the extra technical assistance and financial `push' so as to ensure that the achievements
o f the previous operation are sustained and given momentum for the longer term.


11.      PROJECT DESCRIPTION

A. LendingInstrument

29.     This project i s a follow-on operation, processed as a Specific Investment Loan (SIL), and
financed through an InternationalDevelopment Association (IDA) Grant. The proposed duration
o fthe project is four years.

B. ProjectDevelopmentObjective and Key Indicators

30.     As a repeater andmore focused operation, the PDO for IECDI1is a simplified version o f
the IECD's PD05. The PDO is to improve the health, nutrition, and access to pre-school
education o f Eritrean children aged six and under inthe project villages. A particular effort will
be made across components/activities to ensure that all Orphans andVulnerable Children (OVC)
inthe target villages are benefiting equally from the project.

31.     A crucial lessonwas learnt from the previous project interms o fthe indicators for
nutrition and early education. Reducing malnutrition i s a higher level outcome and, as such, one
that the Country Strategy itself i s responsible for - as opposed to an operation or even a subset o f
HumanDevelopment (HD) interventions. Inlight o fthis it is suggestedthat the PDO
achievement o f IECD I1be measured by simpler, more reliable, andmore easily measurable
indicators than usedinthe first project. Similarly, ECEC can impact repetition and dropout rates
inlowerprimaryschool only after 5-7 years o funinterruptedimplementation and, therefore, will
not be monitored inthis project. A set o fintermediate outcomes andindicators havebeen agreed
upon and they are discussed in Section 111. C as well as inAnnex 3.

32.     These are the proposed PDO indicators:

        (i)CombinedCaseFatalityRatefromthefivemainchildhoodillnessesintheproject
            villages; and


  IECDObjectives were: (i)promote healthy growth and development ofchildrenunder six years of age; (ii)
                           to                                                                                    to
expand access to, and improve the quality of, services that address the basic needs o f young children; (iii)
                                                                                                            to support
orphans and children facing especially difficult circumstances up to the age o f 18 years; and (iv) to improve health
andnutritionof children inprimary schools.

               Kindergartens (KGs) and Community Care Givers (CCGs) inthe project villages.

 33.      Although not as part o f its Results Framework, IECD I1will continue tracking
malnutrition rates inthe project villages, while the M o Hwill continue monitoring it nationwide
through its Nutrition Sentinel System (NSS). Likewise, the MoE will keep monitoring the
primaryeducation indicators, includingrepetition and dropout rates. Interms ofthe longer term
impact that ECD has on children's health, growth, education outcomes and quality o f adult life,
 an evaluation i s being plannedinthe context o f the HumanDevelopment Impact Evaluation
Program o fthe Africa Region inthe World Bank.

34.       Duringthe previousproject the capacity to collect andintegrate information from the
implementing line ministrieswas developed significantly. At the village level, capacity needs
 strengthening inorder to mainstream the use o fthe M&E feedback loop. IECD I1will address
this needby implementing the village level M&E feedback loop inthe target villages at the onset
o f the project through proper training and support for the Village Administrators.

C. ProjectComponents

35.       The proposed IECD I1will consolidate andstrengthenthe existing IECDinterventionsto
address young children's needs inthe areas o f Maternal andChild Health andNutrition, and
ECEC through three main components, namely: (i)              maternal and childhealth and nutrition; (ii)
ECEC; and(iii) Management, Monitoringand Evaluation, Advocacy and Strategic
                   Project
Communication.

36.       The project will provide services and support for maternal andyoung children's needs:
health care, nutrition, cognitive stimulation, and early education. The project will continue
equippingparents, mothers, caregivers andthe community with knowledge and services to
support child growth and development, targeted at various stages o f the young child's
development. Mothers and caregivers will be providedwith knowledge on how to deal with
childhood illnesses, improve existing nutrition behaviors, andthe value o f cognitive stimulation
inthe earlyyears. Healthclinics andcommunities willbeequippedto addressthe major
childhood illnesses. Access to early childhood education through preschool centers will also be
improved.

37.       Interventionswill target 3506villages, where the project will finance integrated services
over the life o f the project. O fthese, 185 villages are in `ready to implement' status given that
most ofthem already have implementation structures, and also have C C G K G centers and
ongoing GMP interventions. The remainder 165 villages are those with ongoing C C G K G
centers, and will become fully integrated within the first two years ofthe proposedoperation, as
health and nutrition interventions are rolled in. Among other inputs, the proposedoperationwill


 Villages inrural areas inEritrea are uniformly disadvantaged inaccess to basic social services. The targeted 350
villages for IECDI1were chosen on the basis of: (i) IECDcoverage; and (ii)
                                                   prior                          readiness to implement an
integrated package of ECD services based on availability of pre-school centers, and plannedhealth and nutrition
activities (per MoH's program).

support the recurrent costs o fthe interventions while the communities prepare and implement an
experimental grant program, the objective o fwhich i s to generate a stream o f income to help
defray recurrent costs o f runningCCGsKGs, HWC-IMCI, and GMP interventions over the long
term.

38.     The proposed operation will utilize the implementation arrangements that are already in
place at all administrativelevels, including at the Central, zoba, and sub-zoba levels. At the
central level, the model o f a Project Management Team (PMT) with the responsibility of

the Technical Support Committee (TSC) - will be continued as inIECD. This team and
coordinating all project activities - with guidance from the Policy Steering Committee (PSC) and

committees are currently operational. At the village level, the proposed operationwill utilize
existing Village Administrators, mainstreamingthe task o f coordinating the integrated
interventions at the community/village level.

Maternal& ChildHealthandNutrition(US$4.3 million)

39.     The main programM o Huses to address child health is IMCI, which has three
components -strengthening the health system, improving the healthworkers' skills, and HWC-
IMCI. The M o H used a large portion o f IECD funds and other donors' support to strengthen and
mainstream the first two components o f I M C Iduringthe past eight years. While the current
work program o fthe Ministrycontinues to consolidate the gains, the focus has now shifted to the
HWC-IMCIpiloted duringthe previous project - expanded to include coverage o fthe newly
born.

40.     The component will aim to: (i)         improve case management andskills o fhealth workers,
community health workers (CHW) through training inprevention and treatment o f childhood
illnesses with the highest morbidity and mortality, andprevention o fmalnutrition inchildren
under five years o fage; (ii)    improve the nutritional status o f children 2 years and under, and
pregnantandnursingmothers through improving healthandnutritionpractices incommunities,
withparticular emphasis on exclusive breastfeeding duringthe first six months from birth;
improving household andcommunity response to .childhoodillnesses, nutrition issues, and
quality o fcare provided to pregnant mothers andyoung children at home; and (iii)         empower
communities and caregivers to improve familykhildhealth care practices through promoting a
supportive and enabling environment at the household andcommunity level for children's
survival, growth and development; improving appropriate andtimely health care seeking
behavior when children need assistance outside home; and increasingcompliance to
recommended treatment and advice from healthprofessionals. The unallocated amount o fUS$1
million would be used to meet any unforeseen needs, e.g. to procure therapeutic feeding should
an episode o f food insecurity arise inthe project areas duringimplementation. The GoE (Policy
Steering Committee), inconsultation with the Bank, will determine on how to use this amount as
the project gets implemented, according to demandand effectiveness o f interventions.

41.     This component will also address two essentialrequisites for HWC-IMCIand GMP to be
effective: (i)provision o f essential I M C Idrugs7as close to the communities as possible with
'These are basic drugs, e.g. paracetamol, co-trimoxasol, Oral Rehydration Salts



                                                         11

appropriate training o fpersons responsible for dispensing them; and (ii)                 implementingprotocols
for treatment andmanagement o f severe and moderate malnutrition, including provision o f
therapeutic feeding. For these two interventions, the Government is expected to work closely
with other partners providing support to GoE, especially UNICEF which has expertise inthe area
o f HWC-IMCI and GMP implementation. The project would finance: relevant training for
Health Workers, CHWs and GMP promoters; HH/C-IMCI medicine kits, including drugs to
equip CHWs; eventual therapeutic feeding to prevent and cure severe malnutrition cases.

EarlyChildhoodEducationandCare(US$6.6 million)

42.      The Ministryon Educationinitiated its ECEC programinthe mid-1990s. Inthe year
2000, at the first opportunity for large scale public investment inyoung children, the MoE
expanded the ECEC program, while updating the curriculum and launching a non formal
approach that has proven to be cost effective to reachthe rural population. Expansion ledto
increased enrollment, which has been noted before. A largenumber o f education officers and
supervisors at various administrative levels have receivedtraining, which made it possible to
mainstream supervision and monitoring o fpre-school centers.

43.      This component will aim to: (i)        consolidate quality inECEC services inthe 350 target
villages through refresher training o f current service care providers, provision o f enhanced
learningmaterials andteaching aids for the KGs and CCGs, professionalcapacity buildingfor all
new ECEC service providers, parenting enrichment training (through training 2,500 adult
education facilitators), and introduction o fpre-school based delivery o fpreventive health
services; (ii)  enhance inclusion o f OVCs (mainly orphans) through the community based
program that aims to integrate orphans into families. It i s estimated that 4,400 orphans will be
re-united with families through provision o f OVC grants to support income generating schemes
for the benefit o fthe families; and (iii)     pilot grant schemeprogram o f ECD services at the
community level through establishing a mechanismo fproviding small community grants that the
communities can use to acquire andbuild assets. The OVC grants are a well-established
program the government started inthe 1990s to meet the challenge o f the largenumber o fwar
orphans. Under the program orphans are reunifiedwith their closest relatives, and the host
family receives a small grantto use for income generating activities to meet the incremental
costs (food, healthcare, school fees andmaterials, clothing). Evaluation studies conducted inthe
second halfo f the 1990s showed that the orphan reunification program was significantly more
cost-effective thanthe traditional orphanages. More importantly, the psychosocialcondition o f
the children benefiting from the OVC grants program was found to be muchbetterthanthat o f
the institutionalized children. The community grants scheme is an innovation andtherefore it
will needto start with a pilot. Approximately 50 to 100villages will be selected to implement
the pilot o f the community grants scheme. The approach will be scaled up inall project villages
based on evidence o f success* andwill take into account the lessons learned from the pilot
villages. There will be a process established o f continuous assessment and feedback o f
experiences inthe implementation o f community grants. Inorder to maximize learning from the
pilot, villages will be selected to represent the microclimatic/agriculturalvariety inthe country
(e.g. lowlands vs. highlands), as well as low and highcapacity levels. A detailed implementation
planwill guide the roll-out o fthe pilot community grants scheme as well as the subsequent

* Baseso n the capacity o f the pilot community to contribute to the recurrent costs of the ECDprogram.

scaling-up. Ifsuccessful, such an approach would both empower communities and help improve
the quality and sustainability o fECE programs. An independent evaluation o fthe approach is
plannedby the third year o fthe project.

44.      Furthermore, the ongoing Regional Resource Centers (RRC) built inPhaseIwill be
W h e r strengthened and supported to become centers o f excellence for ECD ineach zoba,
including ensuring its use intraining programs andillustrating model teaching, monitoring and
evaluation. UNICEF will provide support to the M o E inassessing the needs andrequirements of
these RRCs and inhelpingto strengthen their services. The Project would finance: relevant
technical assistance and training for ECEC supervisors and adult education facilitators; in-
service training for KGteachers, CCGs, as well as sensitization o f lower primary school teachers
anddirectors on ECD issues; learningmaterialsandteaching aids for KGs andCCGs; OVC
grants, and community grants to develop community level sustainability o f ECD interventions.

Project Management, Monitoring, Evaluation, Advocacy and Strategic Communication
(US$1.8 million)

45.     This component aims to: (i)     strengthen project management and implementationthrough
an efficient system o f coordinating project activities across the Ministries o fHealth and
Education and at various administrativelevels; timely monitoring, supervision and evaluation,
including collecting relevant data and information, analyses, and reporting on results; and
ensuring reliable and timely procurement h c t i o n s and financial management and reporting; and
(ii)implement effective Advocacy and Strategic Communications, through various
communicationmechanisms and exchanges o f informationhowledge for increasing awareness
o fparents and caregivers with regardto their children's health, nutrition, education and
psychosocialdevelopment. The Project would finance: operatingcosts; consultancies (including
auditing costs); training; printingo f advocacy and communication materials.

D. LessonsLearnedandReflectedinthe ProjectDesign

46.     The following lessons learned, most o fthem described indetail inthe ICR o fIECD, have
been reflected inthe project design.

        (a) Integrationof NutritionandHH/C-IMCI, andcontingency plans. IECD
            demonstrated that nutrition interventions are successfbl when integrated with health
            interventions. Furthermore, inenvironments that can experience food insecurity
            episodes, it i s essential to have a contingency plan that can be activated fast ifneeded,
           which the proposed project includes inits design.

       (b) Nationalownershipandbuy-inis important inachieving development outcomes.
           Clearly, the achievements realized inIECD result from the GoE not viewing its role
           as purely that o f a beneficiary or facilitator. The commitment andresponsiveness
           shownbythe GoE was that o f a majority shareholder whose development interests
           were the paramount considerations inall deliberations made and decisions taken.
           Such support andinterest has been forthcoming duringthe preparationo fthis repeater
           operation.



                                                   13

(c) Role of ProjectUnits. Different from the traditional Project ImplementationUnits
    which carry out implementation for and report to the line ministries, the Project
    Management Team (PMT) inIECD coordinated the line ministries' implementation
    o f decentralized, multi-sectoral operations. It also facilitated the communication
    across levels o f administration, and performedthe financial management (FM) and
    procurement functions on behalfo f the line ministries, with their technical inputs.
    This model worked well, with the PMT reportingto the Policy Steering Committee,
    chaired bythe Ministry o f Education, and receiving guidance from the Technical
    Support Committee, chairedby the Director General o f General Education. The same
    structure would continue inIECD 11, with a greater focus on mainstreamingthe
    program at the village level (at the zoba and subzoba levels, the IECD program i s
    already almost fully mainstreamed).

(d) MonitoringandEvaluation.Itis very common to underestimate the risk o f
    insufficient M&E capacity, especially inmulti-sectoral, decentralized operations as
    these require bothhorizontal and vertical links, inturn calling for a
    complexhntegrated M&E framework. A thorough assessmento f the capacity to
    operationalize such a framework, including the relative readiness o f the participating
    line ministries, and a corresponding risk mitigation strategy should be clarified in
    projects o fthis type. The preparation o f IECD I1has taken this lesson into account by
    simplifyingthe M&E framework and clearly defining the roles andresponsibilities
    for M&E, including M&E at the village level.

(e) ComponentDesign andRelevantPolicies. Considering the intent o f delivering an
    integrated package of services, it would be advisable to design project components
    around the level o f implementation(e.g. community, regional, national) as opposed to
    the lines o fthe interventions, as was the case initiallyunderIECD. This project is
    designed to fully integrate its services at the village level.

 f) DevelopmentPartnersEngagementandCoordination. Ofthe three self-standing
    ECD projects inSSA implementedrecently (Kenya, Uganda and Eritrea), IECDwas
    the only one that largely achieved its objectives. A major lesson to be learnt from the
    evaluation o f the three operations i s that a formal, well coordinated partnership
    among all the involved development partners, local and international, i s necessary for
    a successful outcome. This was not the case inany o fthese projects. InEritrea, an
    informal partnership worked because of: (i) project almost exclusively built on
                                                    the
    existing interventions supported by the GoE and other development agencies; (ii)    the
    small number o f development partners; and (iii) GoE's unwavering commitment
                                                        the
    and consistent guidance. IECDI1builds onthese experiences bycontinuing to work
    closely with WHO andUNICEF

(g) Limitedcommunityownership andcapacity, One strong lesson from the relative
    low impact area o f IECD i s that communities need time to understand the benefits o f
    interventions, and need to be supported to develop their own plans for sustainability.
   IECD I1proposes to set right this aspect through the grant scheme program embedded
    inits design, continuous technicalsupport, andintensive sensitization campaigns.



                                           14

 E. Alternatives consideredandreasonsfor rejection

 47.     Giventhe general interest o fthe Government inECDrelatedinterventions, the
 Government and the Bank team considered several options andrejected the following:

         (a) the option o f developing a large new operation in collaboration with many other
             development partnerswith interventions to cover the whole country. This option was
             rejected given the capacity and the fiscal constraints for such a large expansion.
             Instead, IECD I1 builds on the previous experiences and aims to deepen the
             consolidation o f integrated programs while expanding ina phasedmanner.

         (b) the option o fimplementingonly a few vertical interventionsinhealth and early
             childhood care and education intarget villages. This option was rejected, as there i s
             evidence from inside andoutside o f Eritreathat the `integrated' programs are more
             effective inimproving the health and development o f young children. This i s
             especially important for those who come from disadvantaged backgrounds. IECD I1
             aims to provide integrated services, even though the services may originate in
             different Government ministries and departments.


111.     IMPLEMENTATION

 A. PartnershipArrangements

 48.     The project will continue to be supported by development partnersworking inthe Human
 Development sector, especially UNICEF. UNICEF i s engaged insupporting the Government in
 health andnutrition policies andprograms as well as inthe education sector, including early
 childhood, through capacity building.UNICEF will continue to provide such support inthe
 crucial areas o f implementing HWC-IMCI and GMP throughout the implementation period of
 the proposed project. UNICEF will also help assess the capacity needs o f the RRCs andprovide
 inputs for improvements. The ECwill be engaged inthe areao f food securityduringtheir next
 phase o f support starting in2008, although the exact nature o f that support i s still being
 discussed between the E C and the Government.

 B. InstitutionalandImplementationArrangements

 49.     The institutional and implementation arrangements remainthe same as those established
 under IECD and would be guidedby the Government's policy o f devolving responsibility to the
 decentralized levels and o fpartnership with the communities inthe implementation o fnational
 development programs, as prescribed by the National Decentralization Policy (1996).
 Furthermore, these arrangements follow a multi-sectoral organizational structure andworking
 principles that emphasize participationandfeedback, ensuring the delivery of ECD interventions
 inanintegrated manner andofquality intheproject villages.

 50.     At theNational level, the Policy Steering Committee (PSC), amulti-sectoral committee
 composed o fthe Ministers o f Education, Health, Labor andHumanWelfare, and chaired by the
 Minister o f Education sets ECD policies andprovides overall guidance inproject


                                                  15

implementation. It convenes at least twice a year andwhenthe need arises. The Technical
Support Committee (TSC), also a multi-sectoral committee comprised o fthe Director Generals
(DG)o fthe ministries o feducation, health, and labor andhumanwelfare and chaired bythe DG
o f education provides technical guidance, ensuringtechnical quality o fthe interventions. It
meets at least four times a year and when the need arises. The PMT, established under the
umbrella o f the Ministryo f Education during IECD, i s responsible for the day-to-day project
coordination and progress monitoring. Inaddition, it supervises the flows and utilization o f
hnds andprovides guidance on matters related to procurement, planningandbudgeting,
financial management and accounting. It is also responsible for all project reporting as required
bythe Bank. The Project Manager is assistedby a Procurement Officer, a Financial
Management Officer, an M&EOfficer and a Communications Officer as well as by a team of
support staff (accountant, procurement assistant, cashier, administrative assistant). Having
managed IECD ina satisfactory manner, the key staff o fthe PMT (Manager, Procurement and
Financial Officers) is already intheir positions andwill bringsolid experience inthe
implementationo f ECD interventions ina hlly integratedfashion. Inaddition over the years,
the PMT knowledgeo fBank'sprocedures andimplementationcompliance hasbeen
significantly strengthened.

51.     At the zoba level, implementationwill becarriedout through the regional
administrations, with the same multi-sectoral structure as at the national level. ECD activities
fall under the mandate o f the Social Services Department o f the region. Under the leadership o f
the Governor, the Director General o fthe Social Service Department, who plays a key role inall
social development activities at the regional level, will manage the implementation o fthe project
incollaborationwith the directors ofthe departments ofeducation, health, labor andhuman
development. Inaddition to this multi-sectoral collaboration, fostering the hnctional linkages
andthejoint planningo finterventions, there will be increasing advocacy andpartnership with
the National Uniono fEritrean Women (NUEW) andNationalUniono fEritreanYouth and
Students(NUEYS) to benefit from their well-established links with the communities. The day-
to-day project coordination and progress monitoring will also be ensured at the zoba level
through a small-sized structure, comprising a project coordinator and a finance officer as key
staff. Functions related to M&Eand communications will be performedusingthe zoba's
administrative structure with support from the PMT at the national level. At the Sub-zoba level,
there will be a staff inthe Administrative office playing the intermediary role o f coordinating the
activities o f village working groups inthe sub-zoba and of information channelingbetweenthe
villages andthe zobas.

52.     At the Village level, working groups are established andwill bethe "direct" entity
responsible for the implementation o f ECD inan integrated manner, including the follow-up o f
program interventions. The working group i s constitutedbymembers o fthe village; its
composition can vary to include groups representing women and youth but will have a core
group with kindergartenteacher, and/or care giver, and/or growth promoter, and/or community
health worker. The village working group will receive technical support from the Village
Administrator and other service providers. It is headed by a Village Administrator,
knowledgeableo f ECD implementation inan integrated approach, having been member o f
working groups under the IECD project. The Village Administrator will monitor, supervise and
report on the activities o f the working groups.



                                                 16

53.      Roles andresponsibilities o f the staff working at each level o fthe implementation
structure are defined inthe Project ImplementationManual.

54.      The integration approach inthe delivery o fECD interventionshas been strengthened
progressivelyover the years due to several factors, notably: (i)   a strong Government
commitment; (ii)    communities having increasing knowledge about the benefits o f integrated
ECD services; (iii)   awareness o f decision makers that the village i s the center for integration; (iv)
experiences acquired throughout the implementation o fthe IECDproject. Inorder to sustain the
knowledge and experiences inthe integration approach andto ensure the delivery o f quality
interventions, the project will adopt a number o f implementation strategies and principles that
would foster strong partnership across line ministries, between the national andthe regional
levels, and a participatory approach inthe communities. A number o fthese strategies consist o f
(i) establishing a two-way reporting communication from the national to the regional to the
village levels andvice-versa; (ii)  deploying the implementation o f the ECD integrated package
model; and (iii)  usingfindings o fmulti-sectoraljoint site visits to provide feedback to the
decisionmakers and the communities on ways to improve the integrated delivery o fECD. (see
Annex 6 for details).

C. Monitoring and Evaluation of outcomes/results

55,      An important lesson learnt from the previousproject-and from humandevelopment
operations ingeneral i s that the risk o f'insufficient M&Ecapacity i s often underestimated. This
                        -
i s especially true for multi-sectoral, decentralized operations as these require bothhorizontal and
vertical links, inturn calling for a complexhtegrated M&E framework. The preparation team
has taken four measuresto mitigate this risk: (i)   the IECD Results Framework and the
arrangements for results monitoring were simplified; (ii)    M&Eroles andresponsibilitieswithin
the implementation arrangements were clarified; (iii)thorough assessment o fthe capacity to
                                                         a
operationalize such a framework was conducted during appraisal, including the relative readiness
o f the implementing line ministries; and (iv) explicitly included village level M&Einthe
framework. However, mainstreamingo f the use o f the M&E feedback loop at the village level -
instrumental for assessingand achieving rapidresults on the ground -was not developed fully
duringthepreviousproject given that: (i)    integration at the village level took place towards the
endo fthe implementationperiod(there was no time for the implementersto internalizethe
concept); and (ii)  USAIDwas the only source o fspecialized training andthey left the country in
2005. IECD I1will start applying the concept inthe integrated villages from effectiveness, with
technical assistance andrelevant training.

56.      The assessment concludedthat the capacity o fthe participant line ministries responsible
for collecting data on the outcome andintermediate outcome indicators intheir respective sectors
improved duringthe implementationo fthe previous project, boththrough learningby doing and
technical assistance from UNICEF and WHO. At the PMT level- responsible for collecting and
integrating information from the implementing lineministries-the assessmentrecommended
that an M&Eofficer be rehired and be inplace by effectiveness.

57.      Data collection and use at subzoba, zoba andnational levels will take place through the
ministerial channels as manyinterventions (e.g. HWC-IMCI) are now mainstreamed inthe

activities o f the ministries. At the village level, the Village Multisectoral Working Group, ledby
the Village Administrator, will be responsible for reviewingimplementationprogress on a
monthly basis. They will receive training on a simplified set o f indicators, andreporting tools
they can use at the village level to monitor progress, andbring issues beyond their control to the
attention o fthe next administrative level.

58.      Concerning baselines,the PDO andintermediate outcome indicators for the maternal and
child health andnutrition component will be measuredby a pre-interventionsurvey duringthe
first year o f implementation. The survey would collect data on CFR, knowledge, attitude and
practice o f communities and families inthe care o fchildren. To collect the required data, the
surveywill relyon child caregivers, healthproviders, healthofficers, community leaders and
influential community groups -both through individual interviews and focal group discussions.
Although not part o fthe Results Framework, the malnutritionrate (weight for age inthe <3 years
olds, and height for age inthe <six years olds) will also be recorded duringthe pre-intervention
survey. The PDO indicator for the early education component i s `percent o f children enrolled at
the correct age (four and five year olds) inKGs and CCGs inthe project villages' andwill be
tracked by the EMIS.A baseline survey will be conducted after effectiveness -at the beginning
o f the school year inSeptember, The intermediate indicator (communities covered for parenting
enrichment training) will be measured as part o fthe training program activities. The
intermediate indicator for sustainability - percent o f recurrent costs o f the ECD programpaid by
communities receiving grants -will be measured as part o fthe grants implementation activities.

59.     The outcome o fthe proposed operation on schoolreadiness andcognitivedevelopment
will be measuredby arigorous impact evaluation o fintegrated ECD - an achievement
consideringthat it would be the first time this kindo fknowledge i s generated inSub-Saharan
Africa. The evaluation, part o f the HumanDevelopment Impact Evaluation Program o fthe
Africa Region funded through an IDF grant, will also be the basis for measuring the longer term
benefits o f IECD as described inh e x 9.

D. Sustainability

60.     The Government i s keen to scale up the IECDprogram as it recognizes that the returns to
investmentinyoung children are highinthe long run. Scalingup the successful IECDprogram
and sustaining its positive outcomes at the individual and social levels requires sustained
financing. The Government does not yet have a clear financing strategy to scale up and sustain
IECD over the next seven to ten years. However, consistent with the National IECDPolicy that
emphasizes a partnership model among the Government, development partners, and
communities, the Government has proposed a two pronged model to help generate adequate
resources for expanding ECD interventions and maintaining their quality.

61.     First,the Governmentwill pilot a grant provision scheme to Community based-
organizations (CBOs) to establish income generating activities, which would generate
community resources for ECD. Such resources would be used for defraying recurrent costs, such
as salary incentives to caregivers, or other small operations and maintenance costs incurred in
ECD centers.




                                                    18

62.     There are three favorable factors that are likely to leadto the success o fthis grant
provision scheme inEritrea:

        (a) Eritreahas a strong locally-based community-participation structures, which includes,
            at the village level, a general `Community Development and Reconstruction
            Committee' (CDRC) and other thematic committees that report to the CDRC. The
            proposed scheme would also operate as a thematic committee and would report to and
            be guidedbythe CDRC.

        (b) Eritreahas implemented anational schemethat is similar to the proposed scheme
            through the successful and ongoing Savings and Micro Credit Program (SMCP). The
            grantprovisionschemewill buildon the experience o fSMCP andreceive initial
            technical support from SMCP inthe areas o f administering the flow o f funds,
            reportingrequirements, etc.

        (c) More generally, Eritrea has a long tradition o f community participationdating back
            manyyears andany community-based programs such as the proposed scheme would
            be receivedpositively by communities.

63.     The Government i s cognizant o fthe risk involved inimplementing this scheme. In
particular, while the program such as SMCP `rides on' the personal motivation o f individuals
interested ingenerating income, this program would have to depend on the motivation o f
individuals who wish to invest their effort inthis scheme with a `social' cause. As a result, the
chances o f success are unknown. The Government is developing a detailed manual for grant
implementationand has proposed to pilot this approach in 50-100villages and evaluate its
success before a larger scale up i s implemented. Inorder to maximize learning from the pilot,
villages will be selected to represent the microclimatic/agricultural variety inthe country (e.g.
lowlands vs. highlands), as well as low andhighcapacity levels. The proposed scheme i s
described inAnnex 6 and further details are provided inthe Community Grants Manual.

64.     Second, buildingon a prior work on costing o f the ECD Policy 2005, the Government
andthe Bank are expected to review fiscal spaceissues inthe HDsectors with a focus on
education (including ECE level), as a way to define a detailed financing strategy for sustainable
financing for IECD inthe next 7-10 years. Such an exercise will provide accurate information on
the financing gaps, and options that could be explored, including reallocation within and across
public resources, donor financing, as well as community contributions. Regardingthe
sustainability o f the OVC grants program, the evaluation conducted under the IECD, in2004,
showed clearly that it i s a sustainable program, with a success rate o f over 90 percent o fthe
income-generating activities it financed. More importantly, the evaluation found that the
reunified orphans were enjoying good physical, as well as psychosocial health andwere all
enrolled inschool.

IV.       APPRAISAL SUMMARY

 A. Economic and FinancialAnalyses

 65.     An economic case for government interventioninearly childhood education canbe made
 on the grounds o f equity and poverty reduction (World Development Report, 2006). Many
 areas inthe country with low humandevelopment indicators, particularly education attainment,
 also have a highpovertyrate. The most significant benefit o f government investment inECD
 programs is leveling the starting ground for the disadvantaged children, ensuring they have an
 equal opportunity to achieve higher human development levels and earnings potential inlater
 life, which would lead to breaking the intergenerational cycle of poverty and to lowering the
 overall poverty rate inthe future (World Development Report, 2006).

 66.     A secondbroadjustification for government interventioninearly childhood education is
 that there are market failures inthis area including liquidityconstraints, incomplete
 information, and externalities. Liquidityconstraints may prevent parents from making optimal
 investments inthe humancapital o ftheir children. Information on child-care provision i s also
 asymmetric inmany cases. The Government can improve outcomes by developing, publicizing
 andimplementingstandards.

 67.     A thirdjustification couldbe made on the basis o fcost-effectivenesso fsuch
 interventions. ECD can be a powerful tool to help stop deficits ineducation andhealth from
 takingholdand accumulatingthroughout youth: internationalresearch shows that children who
 participateingood ECD programs are less likely to drive up education costs byrepeatingclasses
 inprimaryschool and are less susceptible to chronic healthissueswhichrequire expensive
 remedies. Furthermore, people who start out with very unequal endowments interms o fwealth,
 ability, and opportunities are likely to end up with very unequal outcomes. A government that is
 concerned with equity can compensate the differences infinal outcomes.

 68.     Earlychildhooddevelopment public programs targetedto the poor have shown
 significant impact inboth developed and developing countries. Many findings also suggest that
 the payoffto early intervention i s greatest for the most disadvantaged children. Analyses also
 show that ECD programs are more cost-effective than alternative special education programs
 aimed at helping disadvantaged children achieve primaryeducation completion. Given the high
 unitcost o fproviding specialprimaryeducation, investment o fpublic resources inECD
 programs inmost cases i s more cost-effective inhelping disadvantaged children complete
 primaryeducation.

B. Technical

69.     This operation builds on the extensive technical backgroundwork on ECD generally
available andalso specific work done inthis sector inEritrea. It also builds on the lessons
learned from IECD. Success o f IECD stemmed from the fact that most o f the project
interventionshadbeenbased on sound knowledge as well as strong commitment and
implementation support from the Government. There was also continued support for capacity
buildingduringimplementation. This project, designed as a repeater, continues to be strong inits
share o f tested interventions and - even inthe case o frelatively new interventions - training
manuals, guidelines and humanresource have been reasonably well developed now and form the
asset base for implementationo f IECD 11. The final impact evaluationo f IECD has beena major
source o f information inthe preparation process.

C. Fiduciary

70.     FinancialManagement.The Assessment revealed that the key Projectmanagement
committees and structures are already inplace and operational. A Project Steering Committee
(PSC) made up o fthe Ministers o fthe implementingministries has been set up, which will act as
the policy setting and oversight body for the Project. The Technical Support Committee (TSC)
made up o fthe Director Generals o fthe implementing ministrieshas also beenset up. The
Project Management Team (PMT) which will coordinate the day to day activities o fthe Project
is operational andi s appropriately staffed. The PMT already has a Project Manager, the Finance
Officer and a Senior Accountant. Boththe Finance Officer and the Senior Accountant have the
requisite professional qualifications and were engaged on the IECDP phase Iinthe same
capacity and hence are appropriately experienced inmanagingWorld Bank projects. The
Finance Officer has a Bachelor o f Arts Degree inAccounting and 20 years relevantexperience
while the Senior Accountant has aDiploma inAccounting and over 8 years relevant working
experience. Inaddition, a Junior Accountant and Cashier will be deployed inthe PMT by
December 31,2008.

71.     The PMT has a computer accounting software which hasbeeninstalledboth at the
headquarters and at the zoba offices, andis deemed adequate to support the accounting and
financial reportingneeds o fthe Project. The PMT will work under the direction o fthe TSC and
will beresponsible for all the fiduciary aspects o fthe Project.

72.     The Government will open a Designated Account denominated inU S dollars, a Special
Account denominated inNakfa and the Government o f Eritrea (GOE) Counterpart fhding
account inNakfa. All these 3 accounts shall be heldinthe National Bank o f Eritrea and will be
managed bythe PMT. Six RegionalProject Accounts denominated inlocal currency (Nakfa) will
be opened in local commercialbanks acceptable to IDA (one ineach o fthe six zobas). The
Regional zoba Accounts will be managed by the zoba Administrator or his designate and the
zoba Finance Officer. All the bank accounts shall be segregated and utilized strictly for the
Project.

73.    The Project will use the report-based method o f disbursement to access funds. The
Project will be requiredto prepare and submit quarterly financial reports (IFR) to the Bank for



                                                 24

purposes o fmonitoring the financialprogress o fthe Project andmakingdisbursement o f fwnds.
The accounting system is deemedrobust enough to support this methodo fdisbursement.

74.      The audit arrangements are deemed adequate andthe audit reports andmanagement
letters for IECDP, were o f good quality and were receivedon time and appropriately acted on by
management. The Project will be requiredto appoint auditors acceptable to the Bank and to
prepare and submit annual audit reports. These audit reports andmanagement letters will be
submitted to the World Bank as soon as available but inany case within six months after the end
o fthe relevant financial year.

75.      Basic financial operating procedures are inplace at the PMT. However, given the lack o f
internal audit function, the Project's external auditors will conduct interim internal control
reviews (every six months) covering national, regional, sub-regional andvillage levels, and issue
systems audit reports. This will supplement the quarterlyvisits that the PMT will be makingto
the various zobas to assessproject performance. The first internal control review will be done for
the period ended December 31,2008, andsubsequentreviews will be done for the period ended
June 30 and December 31 duringProject implementation.The relevant reports will be submitted
to the PMT by the auditors for action andcopies sent to the Bankwithin 2 months o f end o f each
half-year (by August 31 andFebruary28). The Project's external auditor (who will also
conduct the internal control review), will be appointed by October 31,2008.

76.     Nevertheless, the Project would be required to take some actions to enhance its Financial
Management Capacity inorder manage the project hnds more effectively. The following
FinancialManagement (FM) Conditions need to be completed as a precedent to the Project being
declared Effective.

         (a) Prepare an updated Financial Management Procedures Manual and a satisfactory
             Grant Operations Procedures Manual as parto fthe Project ImplementationManual
             (PIM) inform and content satisfactory to the Bank.

         (b) Deployment o f six zoba Finance Officers (one to each o fthe six zobas).

Another major Financial Management Covenant (Disbursement Conditions for Community
Grants) i s capacitybuildingtraining workshops on the grants flow o f funds and accountability
process/procedures for the Project staff at national, zoba and sub-regional levels.

77.     The PMT i s already working on the updatingo fthe Financial Management Procedures,
the updating o fthe OVC GrantsManual, and development o fthe Community Grant Manual as
part o fthe PIM. The deployment o fsix zoba Finance Officers is expected to bedone as soon as
the project i s approved by the Bank. These officers were re-assigned to other government
departments on the completion o f IECDP so as to cut down on operating costs. However, they
can be re-deployedonce the new Project i s on-line. The Project is therefore considered to be ina
position to substantially address all the Effectiveness conditions at an early date.

78.     Pendingthe completion o fthe on-going enhancement o fthe FMarrangements, the
overall risk rating o f the implementingentity has beenassessedas Substantial. However, this



                                                  25

could improve to Moderate once the recommended FinancialManagement (FM) arrangements as
per the FMAction Planare implemented.

79.     Procurement, The assessmentconcluded that procurement under IECD I1will continue
to be carried out centrally by the PMT. The rationale for this arrangement i s that the PMT has
demonstrated competence under IECD to effectively and efficiently carry out procurement.
With regardto the grant schemeprogram, procurement will follow its manual. The key issues
and risks have been identifiedandcorrective measures havebeen agreed and described inthe
Action Plan (Annex 8). The actions proposed include: (i)     updating the procurement section of
the Project ImplementationManual; (ii)    preparation o f standard biddingdocuments; (iii)
refresher courses on Selection and Employment o f Consultants; and (iv) introducing
improvements inthe procurement filing system. The residual risk for procurement i s
Substantial.

D. Social

80.     The program i s likely to have a positive social impact because it aims to contribute to the
improved health and development o fyoung children. It also seeks to promote equity by
emphasizing services geared towards rural, under-served areas, as well as disadvantaged groups,
including orphans and children with disabilities, Health and ECE interventionswill also seek to
target the nomadic populations (about 30 percent o f the total population inEritrea is composed
o f ago-pastoralists). The M o Hwill expand its present I M C Iprogram andM o E will also focus
on establishing appropriate ECE interventions inrural areas.

81.     Inthe design ofthe grant scheme, communities havecontinuedto beconsulted. During
the preparation o fthe IECD 11,the grants scheme and the results framework were discussed ina
workshop with some 40 zoba level officers from all sectors. Duringimplementation,
communities will be inthe `driver seat' with respect to implementing the grants after being
trained inbuildinggroup cohesiveness and inbusiness activity start-up. Project preparationhas
involved the participationo fthe ministries o f Education, Health, and Labor as well as the PMT
staff. The project has been discussed with key external partners such as the EC andUNICEF.

82.     The project will benefit the target group o fabout 132,000 Eritreanyoung children aged
six andunder. It will also benefit mothers, caregivers, families, children facing difficult
circumstances, teachers, social workers, and health workers. Inparticular, OVC will benefit
from IECD I1inthat it continues to support the government's OVC grants program. A pilot for
the program Evaluation studies conducted inthe second halfo f the 1990s showed that the orphan
reunification program was significantly more cost-effective thanthe traditional orphanages.
More importantly, the psychosocial condition o f the children benefiting from the OVC grants
program was found to be muchbetter than that o fthe institutionalizedchildren. The community
grants scheme is an innovation and therefore it will needto start with a pilot.

83.    As with the IECD, theproject is expectedto berated `C', with no significant
environmental and social impact.

                     Annex 1: Country and Sector or ProgramBackground
                EFUTREA: IntegratedEarly ChildhoodDevelopmentProjectI1

1.     Eritrea is located along the Red Sea, north o f the Horn o f Afiica, between Djibouti and
Sudan.Eritrea's longest border is sharedwith Ethiopia to the south. Since the resumptionof
conflict with Ethiopia in 1998, there has been an impasse inthe transition to a market-based
economy. At the time o f the last Interim Strategy Note (ISN 2005-07 Report No. 31665-ER)
which was discussed at the Board inMarch2005, promising signals from the Government o fthe
State o f Eritrea (GoE) ledto a Bank strategy based on support for economic and fiscal reforms.
GoE also considered participationinthe Heavily IndebtedPoor Country Initiative (HIPC) for
which it remains potentially eligible to receive debt relief. However, client commitment to the
necessary reforms has been uneven over the course o fthe I S Nperiod as the border dispute with
Ethiopia remainedunresolved. Hence, the Bank shifted focus to maximize improved service
delivery through the existing portfolio andplanned analytical work.

2.     The impact o f the current policies on the economy has not been entirely conducive to
retain the gains from post-conflict boom. There has beenprogress inaddressing macroeconomic
imbalances as fiscal deficits were brought down from 21 percent o f GDP to 10percent o f GDP
during2005-07 though further adjustment is needed. The decline inimports improved external
imbalances but has acted as a constraint on economic growth. Annual GDP growth 2005-2007
averaged around 1percent and declined on a per capita basis. To revitalize the economy, the
GoE strategy has beento improve broad-based growth through rural development, and to
develop several specific economic initiatives to: (i) explore and extract valuable mineral
deposits; (ii) develop tourism and commercial fishing; and (iii)  encourage inward investment in
newly-established economic tax-free zones, Inaddition to continuing to correct fiscal
imbalances, GoE indicated duringthe International Monetary Fund's Article IV mission that it
would consider steps to correct external imbalances in2008. Despite the weak overall economic
performance, the Government support for the social sectors has remained strong and World Bank
assistancehas achieved positive results inthe health and early childhood and education sectors

3,    Ingeneral, reliabledatais difficult to obtainandpoverty dataneedsupdating. The last
householdsurvey andParticipatory Poverty Assessment (PPA) undertaken in2003 estimated
around two thirds o f the populationwere livingbelow the poverty line. Although the reliability
o fthe estimate i s questionable (data showed favorable agriculture production following a bad
drought year in2003), it is fair to assumethat poverty rates are very high. Women remain
among the most disadvantaged. Forty-seven percent o fhouseholds are headed by women, half
o fthese are widows as a result o f Eritrea's turbulent history, andthey are overwhelmingly poor -
as highas 85 percent according to the PPA. There has been limitedprogress toward achieving
the MillenniumDevelopment Goals (MDGs), but gains havebeenmade inindicatorso fhealth
andto some extent education outcomes where development partnershave continuedto provide
support.

Sector Issues-Health, Nutrition andFood Security. Education and Early Childhood
Development

Health

4.     The Health Sector plays the most fundamental role in strengthening a country's human
resources, especially the healthy development o f its young children. Since independence, Eritrea
has made admirable progress inimproving the healtho f its people, especially inmalaria,
HIV/AIDSand child survival. Malaria morbidity andmortality havebeenreduced morethan 80
percent since 1999 given good control efforts, makingEritrea one o f few SSA countries to have
met the Abuja Roll Back Malaria targets. HIVprevalence inEritrea is relatively low at 2.4
percent o fthe adult population, compared to the SSA average o f 7 percent. According to the
Demographic andHealth surveys, between 1995 and 2002, infantmortality fell dramatically
from 72 to 48 deaths per 1,000 live births, and under-five mortality fell from 136to 93 deaths per
 1,000 live births. Around 76 percent o f children aged 12-23 months are hlly immunized. The
upcoming 2008 DHS will confirm whether these improvementshave continued.

5.     Despite such achievements, several healthchallenges remain. Child health improvement is
still an unfinishedagenda. While there have been dramatic reductions in infant and under-five
mortality as discussed above, the neonatal mortality rate remains around 25 per 1,000 live births
for the last decade. Poor access to safe water and sanitation contributes to diarrhea, which i s the
leading cause o f illness inchildren. Maternal health i s another challenge. There are different
estimates for maternalmortality ratio (MMR), a more recent estimate i s 450 per 100,000, which
is high. Disparity inreproductivehealth outcomes is large, with maternal mortality ratio many
times higherinremote areas such as the Southern Red Searegionthaninthe capital city o f
Asmara. While 40 percent o fpregnant women have the 4thantenatal visit, only 30 percent deliver
inahealthfacility. The majority ofdeliveries (70 percent) are conducted at homebynon-
medical personnel. The rate o fhealth facility deliveries i s muchhigher inurbanareas (62
percent) than inrural areas (8.6 percent). The GoE has a strategy under implementationto
address these issues, supported inlargepartby HAMSET Iand 11.

Nutrition and Food Security

6.     Malnutrition i s a major concern inEritrea. Data collected at the end o f 2006 for the final
evaluation for the previous IECDproject estimated that 42 percent o f children < 3 years old were
malnourished, o fwhich 13 percent were severely (e3 sd) underweight.

7.     Causes o fmalnutritioninyoung children include both its `immediate' determinants such
as child health andnutrition practices as well as the broader context o f food security/ food
availability. The Integrated Early Childhood Development Project (IECD) implementedin
Eritrea showed that food security problems can dampen the overall impact o f health/ nutrition
interventions; and that any reversal would require both additional efforts at the local level
through programs such as Growth Monitoring andPromotion GMP andthe need to address
food security issues.


9GMP is GrowthMonitoring andPromotion, a community-based approach that helpsprevent and treat malnutrition
inyoung childrenthroughbotheducation/ training andtherapeutic feeding interventions.


                                                   29

 8.    Some 40 percent o fthe Eritreanpopulation i s estimated to be chronically food insecure
due to the cumulative effects ofrepeateddroughts, deforestation, and soil erosionand
degradation. Despite relatively good harvests inthe last two years, the prices o f essential food
items andcereals have been increasing     - possiblythe impact o fhigher global food prices. Global
food prices have risen by 26 percent inthe last three years, and along with other resource-poor,
small SSA countries, Eritrea has suffered a significant terms o ftrade shock as a result o f
commodity price changes (the size of the shock is estimated to be -10 percent o f GDP). Eritrea's
food security strategy attempts to mitigate the impact on household consumption through
centrally managed food supplies andrationed availability o fbasic commodities at fixed prices.
Wheat, sorghum, and barley can be sold only to the GoE, andare therefore subject to price
controls. Fair price shops sell sorghum, sugar, beans, oil, tea, andpasta, which are rationed for
eligible residents based on family size. It is important to emphasize that there is no independent
assessment o fthe success o fthis strategy. The GoE andEC have recently agreed to a new
program o f support focused on food security/rural development, road infrastructure and regional
connections, andcapacity building. Overall, food security remains a major risk inEritrea, and i s
a specific concern for this proposed follow-on operation.

9.     Inlinewithinternationalbestpractice, the Government has adopted atwo-pronged
strategy to deal with malnutrition issues:

      (a)   The Government has a strongprogram, withthe support o fWHO andUNICEF, to
            help address issues o f communitynutrition, including GMP. The program is aimed at
            engaging families and communities to help prevent severe malnutrition (for children
            who are moderately malnourished) through educational programs/ behavioral change
            andhelp refer severely malnourishedchildrento healthunitsfor community-based
            therapeutic and supplemental feeding.

      (b) Inaddition, food security is a government priority. The Food Security Strategy, 2003,
            aims to make "food o f sufficient quantityand acceptable quality readily accessible to
            all at an affordable price at any time andplace within the country." To lower aid-
            dependence, a cash-for-work policy was introduced in2006 to replace free
            distribution o f food aid. Since the cash-for-work programs were introduced, food aid
           has effectively ceased. A Grain Board and a Crop EarlyWarning system have been
            established to manage food supplies. The Boardhas intervenedinthe market for
            food intimes o f scarcity, to stem price increases and i s expected to hold sufficient
            stocks so that intimes o f drought, food can be supplied immediately from domestic
           sources. A Food Security Fundwas also set up to ensure that the government could
           purchase an additional three months worth o f food on the world market to supplement
           the stocks kept bythe GrainBoard.

Education

10.     Inthe Education Sector, primaryschool attendance increasedrapidly following
independence, but currently only 50 percent o f children complete primary school, compared to a
SSA average o f 57 percent. Onthe supply side there are insufficient numbers o fprimary
schools, textbooks, andtrained teachers to ensure that quality education can be provided. . On
the demand side, a large nomadic populationposesparticular challenges facing the authorities


                                                  30

for gettingall children into school. The GoE recognizes that the development o fhumancapital
will be critical for future economic prospects. The ECDprogramwill help addressboth supply
anddemand side challenges bypromoting young children's healthy growth, better development
o f language abilities and social skills thus improving their school readiness.

Early Childhood Education and Development

-11. about six times over the period 2000-2006 - and gross enrolment rose from about 4.5 percent
         Enrolment inpreschools (four and five year old) is limitedbut has increased substantially
  by
to 19percent, owing largely to a strong community-based approach. Inaddition, owing insome
part to the government program, there was a substantial decrease inrepetition and dropout rates
inGrade 1. Inspite ofthis achievement, there is avast majority ofruralchildrenwho still do not
have access to pre-school andearly childcare. Some development partners such as UNICEF
have continuedto provide assistance to the Government inthe area o f ECE policy, including
support on capacity buildingfor ECE policy making and program development.

12.      As parto fits broad-based growth strategy, the Government o fEritrea (GoE) regards
EarlyChildhood Development (ECD), andthe psychosocial protection o fvulnerable children as
a fundamental conditionto achieving its long-term development goals. There i s a keen awareness
o fthe importance o f investinginyoung children and the long-terms economic and social returns
it can generate. Inlinewith this principle, the GoE ratified the convention on the Rights of the
Child (CRC) in 1994. The government formulated policy guidelines for ECEC in 1995, and for
Primary Health care, Foodsecurity and HIV/AIDS in 1998. Several articles inthe 1997National
Constitution also affirm the ECD imperative. These sectoral policies culminated inthe
finalization o fthe draft Integrated ECD Policy in2005. With funding from the Education
Program Development Fund(EPDF) the Bank provided the GoE technical assistanceto cost the
implementation o fthe program endorsed by the Policy. This preliminary costing exercise
provides the development partners (DPs) with information o f financing gap. The Bank task team
i s engaged in a dialogue with the GoE to explore further fiscal space issues and financing
options.

13.      The IECD policy also provides a framework o f Government, Regional, Administration,
institution, communities, families and International and National Development Partners for
investing inandimplementing integrated ECDprograms that contribute towards realizing the
well-being o f young children.

14.     Different ministries are implementing sector-specific policies andprograms related to
ECD:

        0   The Ministry o fEducation(MoE) implements the ECECpolicy, supporting equal
            access to and improved quality o fECEC interventions, and the promotion of cost-
            effective community-basedinterventions that promote and strengthen community
            responsibilitywith the intent to achieve sustainability o f interventions.
        0   The Ministry o fHealth(MOH) hasprepared policy guidelines on food security and
            nutrition that focus on children and mothers because o f their observed vulnerability to
            malnutrition.



                                                  31

        0   The Ministry o f Labor and HumanWelfare (MOLHW) has programs inplace to
            strengthen the traditional safety nets with a focus on supporting children inneed of
            special protection, especially orphans.
            Onthe civil society side, the NationalUniono fEritreanWomen (NUEW) and the
            NationalUnion o f Eritrean Youth (NUEY) are actively engaged inadvocacy efforts
            that promote the rights and well-being o fwomen andchildren.

15.     The GoE recognizes that ECD interventions yield strong and sustainable results when
they are integrated at the community level with support from all administrative levels inthe
government. Inthis regard, the National DecentralizationPolicy (Proclamation No. 86/96 for the
Establishment o fRegionalAdministration) andits framework play a critical role inenhancing
effective ECD implementation. This policy aims to devolve program management responsibility
to regions (zobas), sub-regions (sub-zobas), and communities as a means o f improving
performance, financial transparency and accountability, effectiveness and sustainability.

       Annex 2: Major RelatedProjectsFinancedby the Bank and/or other Agencies
                ERITREA: IntegratedEarly ChildhoodDevelopmentProjectI1

1.      The following projects havebeen and are related to the proposed operation. HAMSET
andIECDhave beeninstrumentalinaddressing important health and early childhood education
andcare issues faced byyoung children. ESPhas beeninstrumentalinaddressing education
sector issues, including early childhood education issues. HAMSET I1i s expected to sustain and
consolidate the benefits derivedfrom its predecessor inimproving health conditions. There are
substantial complementarities betweenIECD I1and the other humandevelopment operations
active inEritrea: (i) betweenthe Reproductive Health component o f HAMSET I1andthe
Maternal andChildHealth andNutritioncomponent o f IECD 11; (ii)      betweenimproved school
readiness (especially for the more disadvantaged children) pursuedby IECD and ESP's
objective o f improving equitable access to and quality o fprimary and secondary schools. IECD
also complements andbenefits from the ongoing programs o f WHO andUNICEF.
From the institutional development point o fview, IECD I1provides the opportunity for the line
ministries implementing HDprograms to come together anddevelop the skill o f multi-sectoral
planningfor better results at the community level.

2.      HIV/AIDS,Malaria, STD, Tuberculosis Control andReproductiveHealth(HAMSET)
Project (Closed: 03/31/2006, PDO rating: Satisfactory). Malaria rates fell by 60 percent during
the project period; adult HIVprevalence was kept comparatively low at 2.4 percent; TB cure rate
was 80 percent. Sustainabilitywas rated Likely, the institutional development impact
Substantial, the Bankperformance was rated Satisfactory and the Recipient performance was
ratedHighly Satisfactory.

3.      Integrated Early Childhood Development (IECD) Project (Closed: 03/3 1/2007, PDO
rating: Satisfactory). Most health and early childhood education targets were attained. The
outcome sustainability risk was Substantial, andthe Bankperformance and the Recipient
performance were Satisfactory. Concerns about sustainability arose due to the decisionby the
government not to fimdthe work initiated under the project. Development objectives and
implementation progress were considered Moderately Satisfactory and Satisfactorythroughout
the previous ISNperiod.

4.      Education Sector Investment Project (Active, latest PDO rating: Moderately
Satisfactory). The implementationo f this project was ratedas Moderately Unsatisfactory for
most o f the previous I S Nperiod. This was because implementationsuffered serious problems
when a government reviewo fregulations for the constructionindustrysuspended activities o f
local construction firms. The project was restructured inJune 2007 to address this problem, and
decentralizingsmall school constructionto communities was initiated. However, larger
constructionprojects, which require competitive bidding,remain difficult.

5.      HAMSET I1(Active, latest PDOrating: Satisfactory). Although HAMSET I1was not
originally envisaged inthe new lending under I S N2005-07, it was prepared and approved as a
follow-on project in2005 as the Bank's timely response to the government's needs to sustain the
impressivehealthoutcomes achieved underthe first HAMSET project. Project scope was also

expandedto includeReproductiveHealth andHumanResource for Health. The implementation
o f HAMSET I1has been rated Satisfactory and several indicators have improved over the
baseline (2004 and2005 data). For example, in2006, the number o fmalaria cases has decreased
from 35,2 15 to 10,148 and the number o fhealth centers with at least one nurse has increased
from 28 to 68.

                 ERITREA: IntegratedEarly ChildhoodDevelopmentProjectI1

1.       The main objective o fIECD I1is to promote the healthy growth and development o f
children aged six and under. The proposed IECD I1will consolidate and strengthen the existing
IECD interventionsto address young children's needs inthe areas o f Maternal and Child Health
andNutrition, and EarlyChildhood Educationand Care (ECEC) through three maincomponents,
namely: (i)   Maternal and Child Health andNutrition; (ii) Early Childhood Education and
                                                                    and
Care (ECEC); and (iii) Management, Monitoring and Evaluation, and Strategic
                            Project
Communication.

2.       The project will provide services and support for maternal andyoung children's needs:
health care, nutrition, cognitive stimulation, andearly education. The project will continue
equipping parents, mothers, caregivers andthe community with knowledge and services to
support child growth and development, targeted at various stages o f the young child's
development. Mothers and caregivers will be provided with knowledge on how to deal with
childhood illnesses, improve existing nutrition behaviors, andthe value o f cognitive stimulation
inthe early years. Healthclinics andcommunitieswillbeequipped to addressthe major
childhood illnesses. Access to early childhood education through preschool centers will also be
improved.

3.       Interventionswill target 35010villages, where the project will finance integrated services
over the life o fthe project. Ofthese, 185 villages are in 'ready to implement' status giventhat
most o f them already have implementation structures, and also have C C G K G centers and
ongoing GMP interventions. The remainder 165 villages are those with ongoing C C G K G
centers; and will become fully integrated within the first two years o f the proposed operation, as
health and nutrition interventions are rolled in. Among other inputs, the proposed operation will
support the recurrent costs ofthe interventions while the communities prepare and implement an
experimental grant program, the objective o fwhich i s to generate a stream o f income to help
defray recurrent costs o f runningCCGsKGs and CHW/GMP interventions over the long term.

Maternal& ChildHealthandNutrition(US$4.3 million)

4.       The mainprogram M o Huses to address childhealth is IMCI, which has three
components - strengthening the health system, improving the healthworkers' skills, and HWC-
IMCI. The M o Hused a large portion o f IECD funds and other donors' support to strengthen and
mainstream the first two components o f I M C Iduringthe past 8 years. While the current work
program o fthe Ministrycontinues to consolidate the gains, the focus has now shifted to the
HWC-IMCIpiloted duringthe previous project - expanded to include coverage o fthe newly
born.


loVillages inrural areas inEritrea are uniformly disadvantaged inaccess to basic social services. Villages inrural
areas inEritrea are uniformly disadvantaged inaccess to basic social services. The target 350 villages for IECD I1
were chosen on the basis of: (i) IECDcoverage; and (ii)
                                prior                         readiness to implement an integrated package of ECD
services basedon availability of pre-school centers, and planned health and nutrition activities (per MoH's
program).

5.      The component will aim to: (i)     improve casemanagement and skills o fhealth workers,
community health workers ( W C - I M C I , covering children aged 5 and under)through training in
prevention and treatment o f childhood illnesses with the highest morbidity and mortality, and
prevention o f malnutritioninchildrenunder five years o f age; (ii)   improve the nutritional status
o f children 2 years andunder, andpregnant and nursingmothers through improving health and
nutrition practices incommunities, withparticular emphasis on exclusive breastfeeding during
the first six months from birth; improving household and community response to childhood
illnesses, nutrition issues, and quality o f care provided to pregnant mothers and young children at
home; and(iii)   empower communities andcaregivers to improve familykhildhealth care
practices through promoting a supportive andenabling environment at the household and
community level for children's survival, growth and development; improving appropriate and
timely health care seeking behavior when children need assistance outside home; and increasing
compliance to recommended treatment and advice from health professionals. The unallocated
amount o fUS$1million will beused to meet any unforeseen needs, e.g. to procure therapeutic
feeding should an episode o f food insecurity arise inthe project areas duringimplementation.
The GoE (Policy Steering Committee), inconsultationwith the Bank, will determine on how to
use this amount as the project gets implemented, according to demandand effectiveness o f
interventions.

6.      This component will also addresstwo essential requisites for HWC-IMCI and GMP to be
effective: (i)provision o f essential I M C Idrugs as close to the communities as possible with
appropriate training o fpersons responsible for dispensingthem; and (ii)   implementingprotocols
for treatment andmanagement o f severe andmoderate malnutrition, including provision o f
therapeutic feeding. For these two interventions, the Government is expected to work closely
with other partners providing support to GoE, especially UNICEFwhich has expertise inthe area
o fHWC-IMCIand GMP implementation. The unallocatedamount o fUS$l million will be used
to meet any unforeseen needs, e.g. to procure therapeutic feeding - through UNICEF       - should an
episode o f food insecurity arise inthe project areas duringimplementation. At midtermreview
the Bank team and the GoE will agree on how to use uncommitted funds inthe last year o fthe
project iffood insecurity episodes have not occurred by then. The finds would be allocated
according to demand and effectiveness o f interventions.

7.      Theproject wouldfinance: relevant training for HealthWorkers, CHWs and GMP
promoters; HWHWC-IMCImedicine kits, including drugs to equip CHWs; eventual therapeutic
feeding to prevent and cure severe malnutritioncases.

9.      EarlyChildhoodEducationand Care(US$6.6 million). The Ministryon Education
initiated its ECEC program inthe mid-90s. Inthe year 2000, at the first opportunity for large
scale public investmentinyoung children, the M o E expanded the ECEC program, while
updatingthe curriculum and launching a non formal approach that has proven to be cost effective
to reach the rural population. Expansion led to increased enrollment, which has been noted
before. A large number o f education officers and supervisors at various administrative levels
have receivedtraining, which made itpossible to mainstream supervision and monitoring of pre-
school centers.10. This component will aim to: (i)   consolidate quality inECEC services inthe
350 target villages throughrefresher training o fcurrent service care providers, provision of
enhanced learning materials and teaching aids for the KGs and CCGs, professional capacity
buildingfor allnew ECEC service providers, parenting enrichmenttraining (through training
2500 adult education facilitators), andintroduction o fpre-schoolbased delivery o fpreventive
health services; (ii)enhance inclusion of OVCs (mainly orphans) through the community based
program that aims to integrate orphans into families. It i s estimated that 4400 orphans will be re-
unitedwith families through provisiono fOVC grants to support income generatingschemes for
the benefit o fthe families; and (iii) grant schemeprogram ofECD services at the
                                     pilot
community level through establishing a mechanismo fproviding small grants that the
communities can use to acquire and buildassets. The OVC grants are a well-established
program the government started inthe 1990s to meet the challenge o fthe large number o fwar
orphans. Under the program orphans are reunified with their closest relatives, and the host
family receives a small grant to use for income generating activities to meet the incremental
costs (food, healthcare, school fees and materials, clothing). Evaluation studies conducted inthe
second half o fthe 1990s showed that the orphan reunification program was significantly more
cost-effective than the traditional orphanages. More importantly, the psychosocial condition of
the childrenbenefitingfrom the OVC grants programwas found to bemuchbetter thanthat of
the institutionalized children. The community grants scheme is an innovation andtherefore it
will needto start with apilot. Approximately 50 to 100villages will be selected to implement
the pilot o fthe small grants scheme. The approach will be scaledup inallproject villages based
on evidence o f success and will take into account the lessons learned from the pilot villages.
There will be a process established o fcontinuous assessmentandfeedback o fexperiences inthe
implementationo f grants. Inorder to maximize learningfrom the pilot, villages will be selected
to represent the microclimatic/agricultural variety inthe country (e.g. lowlands vs. highlands), as
well as low andhighcapacity levels. A detailed implementationplanwill guidethe roll-out o f
the pilot grants scheme as well as the subsequent scaling-up. Ifsuccessful, such an approach
would both empower communities andhelp improve the quality and sustainability o f ECE
programs. An independentevaluation o fthe approach i s planned bythe third year o fthe project.

10.     Furthermore, the ongoing Regional Resource Centers (RRC) built inPhase Iwill be
further strengthened and supported to become centers o f excellence for ECD ineach zoba,
including ensuringits use intrainingprograms and illustrating model teaching, monitoring and

evaluation. UNICEF will provide support to the MOE inassessingthe needs and requirements
o f these RRCs andinhelpingto strengthen their services.
The Project would finance: relevanttechnical assistance andtraining for ECEC supervisors and
adult education facilitators; in-servicetraining for KGteachers, CCGs, as well as sensitization of
lower primary school teachers anddirectors on ECD issues; learningmaterials and teaching aids
for KGs and CCGs; OVC grants; and grants to develop community level sustainability of ECD
interventions.

 11.    Key activities will include the following `generic' cycle inevery village (with
modifications as required):

        (a)  Sensitization and orientation o f communities;
        (b) re-interventionbaseline data collection intarget villages;
        (c)  Establish sub-zonal and village level working groups;
        (d) Refresher trainings conducted for existing KGteachers andCCGs;

        (9 RRC strengthened;
             Enhanced learningmaterials andteaching aids for all the preschool centers procured

        (g) Provisiono fcontinuous support to teachers and CCGs to help them adapt the ECEC
             program to their own local situation, introduce innovations, and develop their own
             supplementary learning materials and aids (mainly through the six regional resource
             centers);

As regards the OVC program, the PIMwill include: (a) criteria for the selection o forphans and
vulnerable children; (b) mechanisms for allocating grants based on needs o f identified families;
(c) mechanisms for providing supervision and support to families inthe implementationo f their
income generating schemes after grants are allocated; (d) mechanisms for the financial
management o fthe grants (flow o f funds and accountability); and (e) mechanisms for the overall
monitoring and evaluationo fthe grants, including an independent evaluation o f the grants.

               ERITREA: IntegratedEarly ChildhoodDevelopmentProjectI1

1.       The project will be implementedusing the administrative structure o fthe Government.
The institutional and implementation arrangements remain the same as those established under
IECD, ridingon the Government's policy o f devolving responsibility to the decentralized levels
ando fpartnershipwith the communities inthe implementation o fnational development
programs, as prescribed by the National Decentralization Policy (1996). Furthermore, these
arrangements follow a multi-sectoral organizational structure and working principles that
emphasize participation and feed-back, ensuring the delivery o f ECD interventions inan
integrated manner ando f quality inthe project villages.

Organizationalstructure

National level

2.       The Policy Steering Committee (PSC), a multi-sectoral committee composed o f the
Ministers o f Education, Health, Labor and HumanWelfare, andchaired by the Minister o f
Education, sets ECDpolicies and provides overall guidance inproject implementation. It
convenes at least twice a year and when the need arises.

3.       The Technical Support Committee (TSC), also a multi-sectoral committee comprised of
the Director Generals (DG) o fthe ministries o feducation, health, and labor andhumanwelfare
andchairedbythe DGo feducation provides technical guidance, ensuring technical quality of
the interventions. Itmeets at least four times a year andwhen the need arises.

4.       The Project Management Team (PMT), established under the umbrella o fthe Ministry o f
Education duringIECD, is responsible for the day-to-day project coordination andprogress
monitoring. Inaddition, it supervises the flows andutilization o f finds andprovides guidance
on matters related to procurement, planningandbudgeting, financial management and
accounting. It i s also responsible for the entire project reporting as required by the Bank. The
Project Manager i s assistedby a Procurement Officer, a Financial Management Officer, an M&E
Officer and a Communications Officer as well as by a team o f support staff (accountant,
procurement assistant, cashier, administrative assistant). Havingmanaged IECD ina satisfactory
manner, the key staff o fthe PMT (Manager, Procurement and Financial Officers) is already in
their positions andwill bringsolid experience inthe implementation o fECD interventionsina
fully integrated fashion. Inadditionover the years, the PMT knowledge o fBank's procedures
and implementation compliance has been significantly strengthened.

Zoba level":

5.      The implementation at the regional levels will be carried out through the regional
administrations, with the same multi-sectoral structure as at the national level. ECD activities fall
under the mandate o fthe Social Services Department o f the region. Under the leadership o f the

                                                  46

Governor, the Director General o f the Social Service Department, who plays a key role inall
social development activities at the regional level, will manage the implementationo fthe project
incollaborationwith the directors ofthe departments ofeducation, health, labor andhuman
development. Inaddition to this multi-sectoral collaboration, fostering the functional linkages
and thejoint planningo finterventions, there will beincreasing advocacy andpartnershipwith
the NationalUnions o fWomen andYouth to benefit fromtheir well-establishedlinks with the
communities.

6.      The day-to-day project coordination andprogress monitoring will also be ensured at the
zoba level through a small-sized structure with a project coordinator and a financial officer as
key staff, Functions related to M&Eandcommunications will be performed usingthe zoba's
administrative structure with support from the PMT at the national level.

Sub-zoba level:

7.      Therewill be a staff inthe Administrative office playingthe intermediaryrole o f
coordinating the activities o f village working groups inthe sub-zoba ando f information
channeling between the villages and the zobas.

Villagelevel:

8.      Working groups are established at the village level andwill be the "direct" entity
responsible for the implementationo f ECD inan integrated manner, including the follow-up o f
program interventions. The working group i s constituted by members o f the village; its
composition can vary to include groups representing women and youth but will have a core
group with kindergarten teacher, and/or care giver, and/or growth promoter, and/or community
health worker. The village working group will receive technical support from the Village
Administrator and other service providers, It is headedby a Village Administrator,
knowledgeable o f ECD implementationinan integrated approach, having been member o f
working groups under the IECDproject. The Village Administrator will monitor, supervise and
report on the activities o fthe working groups.

9.      Roles and responsibilities o fthe staff working at each level o fthe implementation
structure are defined inthe ImplementationManual.

Implementationstrategiesandprinciples,ensuringthe deliveryof ECD interventionsin an
integratedmanner andof qualityinthe projectvillages

10.     The integration approach inthe deliveryo fECD interventionshas beenstrengthened
progressivelyover the years due to several factors, notably: (i)strong Government
                                                                 a
commitment; (ii)  communities' increasedknowledge about the benefits o f integrated ECD
services; (iii)
              awareness o f decision makersthat the village is the center for integration; and (iv)
experiences acquired throughout the implementationo f the IECDproject. To sustain the
knowledge and experiences inthe integration approach, the following main implementation
strategies andprinciples will be applied:

        (a) Cascading communication and supervision from the national level to the zoba levels
              to the village working groups, and a bottom-up communication andreporting from
             the village working groups to the zoba levels to the national level.

        (b) Systematic application o fthe ECD integrated package model that includes growth
              monitoring, householdand community level management o f childhood illness, pre-
              school health, early childhood education, integration o f orphans andvulnerable
              children as well as advocacy andcommunication interventions.

        (c) Regularsite visits for technical and supervision support by multi-sectoral teams with
              PMT staff that will includejoint planningwith the communities for the
              implementationo fthe interventions inan integratedmanner.

        (d) Using findings duringthe site visitsto provide feedback to the decisionmakers as
             well as the village working groups and coordinators for implementation
              improvements.

        (e) Promoting a participatory approach inthe communities and buildingpartnerships
             within the village working groups, coordinators andother service providers to share
              experiences inthe implementation o f ECD integration services.

        ( f ) Conducting advocacy and communication activities to promote the understanding o f
             the benefits o f ECD under an integrated approach.

Summaryimplementationdescriptionof the GrantSchemeProgram to communities

11.     Within the overall objective o fsustaining the benefits o fECD interventions, the Grant
Scheme Program is designed to assist the communities inmeeting the recurrent costs associated
with the implementationo fECD interventions inanintegrated manner.

12.     Each eligible community will receive a grant (average o fUS$5,000 calculated on the
basis o frecurrent cost needs) that will be usedto create community resources for ECD. This will
include income-generating activities that are most suitable to the community, such as community
farminggardening,poultry or other livestock, etc. Parents and community members will be
requiredto contribute labor and to manage andmake the assetsproductive. A Memorandum of
Understandingwill be signed between the recipient community and the zoba, following a process
o f community empowerment and assessment o f eligibility criteria. The Grant Scheme Program
will be implemented andcoordinated using the project implementation structure. Details on the
piloting approach, phasing, implementation approach, and monitoring and evaluation have been
discussed with the Government and a detailed Community GrantsManual will be finalized by
effectiveness (as part o fthe PIM).

13.     The grant concept builds on the strengthso f the Government's Savings and Micro Credit
Program (SMCP) that was developed underthe World Bank funded EritreanCommunity
Development Fund(ECDF) andhas been operating as an autonomous governmental entity since
2002. As such, the Grant Scheme Program, implementedina decentralized mannerat the



                                                 48

regional levels, will receive technical support from SMCP, inthe form o ftraining for
community-based organizations to build group cohesiveness, guidance inthe choice o fbusiness
activities, business set-up, development o fbusiness plans, monitoring andreporting.

14.     The Grant Scheme Programwill be implemented inphases, with the first phase
benefiting 50-100villages. The main processing steps are as follows:

        (a) Phasing and prioritizing communities inthe project villages based on definedcriteria
              (needs, existence o f a KG/CCG, different levels o f capacity, different microclimates,
              etc.).

        (b) Communicationsofthe grantprogram, its objective andbenefits.

        (c) Support to establish a "community-based organization" (CBO).

        (d) Training andtechnical assistanceto the CBO inbuildinggroup cohesiveness andin
              simple project management (business development/plan, bookkeeping, business
              follow-up, etc.).

        (e) Assistance to the CBO inthe selection and development o fbusiness activity based on
             recurrent costs needs for ECD interventions.

        ( f ) Contract signingbetween the regional administration and the beneficiary CBO.

        (g) Monitoring o fthe CBO activities.

Implementationof the OVC Grantsprogram

The details o fthe implementation modalities o fthe OVC Grantsprogram will be inthe updated
OVC Grants Manual to be adopted by effectiveness.

              Annex 7: FinancialManagementandDisbursementArrangements
               ERITREA: IntegratedEarly ChildhoodDevelopmentProjectI1

1.       The IECDP I1is a repeater multi-sectoral project being implementedby 3 ministries,
namely; Ministry o f Education (MoE), Ministry o fHealth(MoH) and Ministry o f Labor and
HumanWelfare (MoLHW). The Projectwillbe coordinated byaProject Management Team
(PMT) drawn from the 3 ministries. The Projectis a follow-on operation, processed as a Sector
Investment Loan (SIL) and financed through an IDA Grant.The initialProject IECDP Iclosed
successfully inMarch2007 with a satisfactory rating inthe ImplementationCompletion Report
(ICR). The PMT for the Project was not disbanded and would be used to manage the activities o f
IECDP 11.

2.       The objectives o f an assessment carried out by the Bank are to determine: (a) whether the
PMT has adequate financial management arrangements to ensure the Project funds will be used
for purposes intended inan efficient and economical way; (b) the Project financial reports will be
prepared inan accurate, reliable andtimely manner; and (c) the assets acquired using Project
fimdswill be safely guarded.

3.    The financial management (FM) assessmentwas carried out inaccordance with the
FinancialManagement Practices Manual issued by the Financial Management Sector Board on
November 3,2005.

I. EXECUTIVESUMMARY

4.       The Assessment revealed that the keyProjectmanagement committees and structures are
already inplace andoperational. A Project Steering Committee (PSC) made up o f the Ministers
o f the implementingministries has been set up, which will act as the policy setting and oversight
body for the Project. The Technical Support Committee (TSC) made up o f the Director Generals
o f the implementingministries has also beenset up. The Project Management Team (PMT)
which will coordinate the day to day activities o f the Project i s operational and i s appropriately
staffed. The PMT already has a Project Manager, the Finance Officer and a Senior Accountant.
Boththe Finance Officer and the Senior Accountant have the requisiteprofessional qualifications
andwere engagedon the IECDPphase Iinthe same capacity and hence are appropriately
experienced inmanaging World Bank projects, The Finance Officer has a Bachelor o fA r t s
Degree inAccounting and20 years relevant experience while the Senior Accountant has a
Diploma inAccounting and over 8 years relevant working experience. Inaddition, a Junior
Accountant and Cashier will be deployed inthe PMT byDecember 31,2008.

5.       The PMT has a computer accounting software which has been installedboth at the
headquarters and at the zoba offices, andi s deemed adequate to support the accounting and
financial reportingneeds o fthe Project. The PMT will work under the direction o fthe TSC and
will be responsible for all the fiduciary aspects ofthe Project.

6.       The Government will open a Designated Account denominated inU S dollars, a Special
Account denominated inNakfa and the Government o fEritrea (GOE) Counterpart fimding
account inNakfa. All these 3 accounts shall be held inthe National Bank o f Eritrea and will be


                                                  50

managed by the PMT. Six Regional Project Accounts denominated inlocal currency (Nakfa) will
be opened in local commercial banks acceptable to IDA (one ineach o fthe six zobas). The
RegionalAccounts will be managed by the zoba Administrator or his designate andthe zoba
Finance Officer. All the bank accounts shall be segregated and utilized strictly for the Project.

7.       The Projectwill usethe report-basedmethodof disbursementto access funds. The
Projectwill berequiredto prepare and submitquarterlyfinancial reports (IFR)to the Bank for
purposes o fmonitoring the financial progress o f the Project andmakingdisbursement o f funds.
The accounting systemis deemed robust enough to support this method o f disbursement.

8.       The audit arrangements are deemed adequate andthe audit reports andmanagement
letters for IECDP, were o f good quality and were received on time and appropriately acted on by
management. The Project will be requiredto appoint auditors acceptable to the Bank andto
prepare and submit annual audit reports. These audit reports andmanagement letters will be
submitted to the World Bank as soon as available but inany case within six months after the end
o f the relevant financial year.

9.       Basic financial operatingprocedures are inplace at the PMT. However, given the lack o f
internal audit hnction, the Project's external auditors will conduct interim internal control
reviews (every six months) covering national, regional, sub-regional and village levels, and issue
systems audit reports. This will supplement the quarterly visits that the PMT will be makingto
the various zobas to assess project performance. The first internal control review will be done for
the period ended December 31,2008, andsubsequent reviews will be done for the period ended
June 30 andDecember 31duringProject implementation. The relevant reports will be submitted
to the PMT by the auditors for action andcopies sent to the Bank within two months o f end o f
eachhalf-year (by August 31 and February28). The Project's external auditor (who will also
conduct the internal control review), will be appointed by October 31,2008.

10.      Nevertheless, the Project would be required to take some actions to enhance its Financial
Management Capacity inorder manage the project funds more effectively. The following
FinancialManagement (FM) Conditions need to be completed as a precedent to the Project being
declared Effective.

         (a) Prepare an updated FinancialManagement Procedures Manual, an updated OVC
             GrantsManual, and develop a satisfactory Community Grants Manual as part of the
             Project ImplementationManual (PIM) inform and content satisfactory to the Bank.

         (b) Deployment o f six zoba Finance Officers (one to each o fthe six zobas).

11.      Another major Financial Management Covenant (Disbursement Conditions for
Community Grants) i s capacity buildingtraining workshops o fthe Project staff at national, zoba
and sub-regional levels.

12.      The PMT i s already working on these such as the updatingo f the Financial Management
Procedure and o fthe OVC GrantsManuals, as well as the development o fthe Community
Grants Manuals as part o f the PIM. The deployment o f six zoba Finance Officers i s expected to



                                                51

be done as soon as the project i s approved bythe Bank. These officers were re-assigned to other
government departments on the completion o f IECDP so as to cut down on operating costs.
However, they canbe re-deployed once the new Project i s on-line. The Project i s therefore
considered to be ina position to substantially address all the Effectiveness conditions at an early
date.

13.     Pendingthe completion o f the on-going enhancement o fthe FMarrangements, the
overall risk rating o f the implementingentity has been assessedas Substantial. However, this
could improve to Moderate once the recommended FinancialManagement (FM) arrangements as
per the FMAction Plan are implemented.

11.     PROJECTINFORMATION

14.     DevelopmentObjective:The Project'sDevelopmentObjective(PDO) is to improve
the health, nutrition, and accessto pre-school education o fEritreanchildren aged six years and
under inthe project villages.

15.     ImplementingEntity: The Projectwillbe implementedbyaPMT as is the casewith
Eritrea donor fundedprojects. The PIUwill be made up o fthe Project Management Team (PMT)
that will manage the day to day activities o f the Project. The use o f a PMT as opposed to country
systems isjustified on account o fthe following: (i)  the Project is multi-sectoral and i s being
implemented by 3 different ministries (MOE, MOH andMLHW). Itwould be difficult to main-
stream andcoordinate the project activities through one ministryhence the need for a PMT
approach; (ii) PMT i s the same one that was used to implement phase one o fthe IECDP and
                the
therefore has the necessary experience to implement phase 11; and (iii) Government o f Eritrea
                                                                          the
traditionally manages donor funded projects usingPMTs and it will take time andpolicy change
to move to substantial use o f country systems.

16.     ProjectCoordination:The Project coordination structures will be set up at national,
regional and community/village level. The key coordinationbodies which have already beenset
up are the following:

        (a) ProjectSteeringCommittee(PSC): Composed o fthe Ministers o f Education,
            Health and Labour andHumanWelfare. The Committee is chaired by the Minister o f
            Education andwill beresponsible for policy oversight.

        (b) TechnicalSupport Committee(TSC): Composed o fDirector Generals o fthe
            ministries o f Education, Health andLabour andHuman Welfare, and chaired by the
            MinistryofEducationDirector General. The Committee willprovidetechnical
            guidance to the Project.

        (c) ProjectManagementTeam(PMT): This team will be formed at boththe national
            andregionayzoba levels. At the national level, the PMT is already operational and
            will be responsible for the day to day operations o fthe Project. However, the Ministry
            o f Educationshall exercise a supervisory role over the nationalPMT on behalf o f the
            other two Ministries. The nationalPMT shall be made up of the following five key
            staff; the Project Manager (who shall be the head o fthe PMT), the Project Finance


                                                 52

            Officer, the Procurement Officer, the Communications Officer and the Monitoring
            and Evaluation(M&E) Officer. For FinancialManagement purposes, the Project
            Manager, the Procurement Officer and the Finance Officer are already on board. The
            national PMT will have overall fiduciary responsibility for the Project under the
            direction o fthe Project TSC. The PMT will ensure that adequate financial
            management arrangements are inplace and continue to be effective and shall also be
            responsible for preparing and submitting the quarterly un-audited interim financial
            reports (IFR) on a timely basis inform and substance acceptable to the Bank.They
            will also beresponsible for ensuring that the annual audit reports andmanagement
            letters are submittedto the Bankwithin six months as required.

        (d) RegionaYzobaPMT: This isheadedbythe zoba Administrator supportedbythe
            following technical staff the RegionalProgram Coordinator andthe Regional
            Finance Officer. Functions related to M&E and communications are mainstreamed in
            the zoba's administrative structure, with support from the PMT at the national level.
            However, the zoba Administrator will delegate the runningo f the program day-to-day
            operations to the Regional Social Services DepartmentDirector General. The
            technical staff will be assigned as soon as the Project is approved.

       (e) RegionaYzobaTechnicalSupport Committee(TSC): This committee i s headed by
            the zoba Administrator. However, he has delegated this responsibilityto the Director
            General o f the Department o f Social Services. Other memberso f this committee are
            the Regional Director Generals o f the Departments o fHealth, Education and Labour
            andHumanWelfare. This committee is already inplace.
       (9 Committeesat CommunityNillageLevels(CAC): EachProjectVillage shall
            constitute a Village Project Management Committee headedby the Village
            Administrator (VA) which will be incharge o fthe project activities at the village
            level. An accounts clerk will give the necessary accounting support to each Village
            Committee. This committee is already inplace under the name o fthe Community
            Economic Development Committee andcan easily be reconstituted to take over the
            Project activities.

17.    CommunityGrantsScheme ProgramandOVC GrantsProgramsub-components:
Through the Community Grants sub-component funds will be disbursed to communities to
support income generating activities that will ensure the sustainability o f the ECD program at the
community level inthe longrun.This sub-component will form about 13 percent o f the overall
Project funds. The OVC Grants sub-component (about 20 percent o fthe Project costs) goes in
support o f a well established government program that aims at sustainable reunification o f
orphans with their closest relatives (the host families). The accounting unit for both types o f
grants will be the zoba PMT office and not the communities/families. Due to limitedcapacity,
the communities will not manage project funds, However, the capacity o f the communities on
financial management will be supported as part o f the project.

18.    The RegionaYZobaPMT will rely on the existingGovernmentsystems and
structuresof disbursingandaccountingfor funds throughthe sub-regional zoba Offices (who
have accountants andcashiers as a government requirement)andthe Village Administrator, who


                                                 53

represents the community members inthe government structure. Any payments required at
community level will be made bythe zoba PMT through the sub-regional zoba offices. The
Project bank accounts for the community grants will be opened at the RegionaVzoba level in
commercial banks acceptable to IDA. As needed, the RegionaVzoba office will provide
advanceshmprests to the sub-regional zoba offices for which expenditure statements will be
submitted.Noproject accounts will be opened at the community level. The accountability ofthe
Project finds including the grant proceeds will be done by the zoba PMT and the zoba Finance
Officer will be responsible for collecting and compiling expenditure returns from the sub-
regional offices and submittingthese to the national PMT office inAsmara.

19.     Nevertheless, the Project i s expected to enhancethe community's income generating
capacity. For instance, village groups could be suppliedwith seeds or fishing nets which would
be expected to boost their incomes inthe longterm, Such investments are expected to continue
even after the Project is complete. To be sustainable, it would be advisable to buildfinancial
management capacity at the village level by training the community onbasic financial
management principles on the basis o f social responsibility.

20.      A GrantOperations Manual, which will define the financial andoperatingprocedures and
set out the basic accounting records, for the Community Grants component i s being developed
bythe PMT. Development o fa satisfactory Grant Operations Manual is a Condition of
Project Effectiveness.

21.     Eligibility Criteria for funding to Villages: The Project is expected to cover 350
villages across Eritrea. The IECDP I1Grantwill be allocated to villages instages, following a
process o f community empowerment and the villages meeting a set o f criteria at each stage.
Although the communityhillage will not handleproject finds, the community will be involved
inincome generating activities, andneedto develop their capacity to handlefinds ona
sustaining basis. The fiduciary criteria will therefore include having the grant management
CAC's inplace, preparing and submitting viable grant proposals, signingo f a Memorandum of
Understanding(MOU) with the zoba PMT, having trained accounts clerks, ability to prepare and
submitmonthly income andexpenditure statements, ability to plan, monitor and account for
funds and activities handledby the village/community. The eligibility criteria would be
documented inthe Grant Operations Manual as part o fthe PIM. The zoba PMT would ensure
that project funds for community grants are made available only for villages that meet the
eligibility criteria. Arrangements at the zoba PMT level to ensure adherence to eligibility
criteria will be covered as part o f the internal control review by the external auditors (see para 29
below).

22.     Development of financial management capacity at the CommunityNillageLevel.
The project would support the financial management capacity development o f the
communities/village to manage their finds (e.g., through income generating activities). An
accounts clerk will give the necessary accounting support to each Village Committee. They will
be provided necessary training. The internal control reviews (discussed later, see para 29 below)
will also review the arrangements at the communityhillage level, covering a sample o fvillages
ineachround.




                                                   54

111.     COUNTRY FINANCIALMANAGEMENT ISSUES

23.      Analytic work on public financial management (PFM) inEritreai s not available.
Limited available information indicates PFMweaknesses (e.g., weak budget-policy link, low
level o f fiscal transparency, non-availability o fbudget planor budget execution information
outside o f government).

IV.      DETAILEDRISKASSESSMENT

Budgeting

24.      Budgeting for the Project will be undertaken by the national PMT. Detailed cost tables
have already beenprepared and approved for the Project. The GOE budget process i s undertaken
bythe Departmento fBudgetinginthe Ministryo fFinance. Separatebudgetcodes willbe
assigned to the Project and the project will be included inGoE's capital budget. GOE's existing
budgeting systems are deemed adequate for purposes o f the Project. However, the PMT will be
requiredto prepare the Projectbudgetand submit it to MOF for inclusion into the National
Budget.

Accounting

25.      Staffing: The national PMT i s currently staffed by a Finance Officer and a Senior
Accountant who are professionally qualified and experienced. The Finance Officer has a
Bachelor o f Arts Degree inAccounting and20 years relevant experience while the Senior
Accountant has a Diploma inAccounting and over eight years relevant working experience. Both
o f them were involved inthe IECDP Ifrom inception untilthe time the Project closed inthe year
2007. Hence they have good experience inmanaging World Bankprojects. However, the Project
would require 2 additional staff inthe nationalPMT namely, a Junior Accountant (accounts
clerk) and a cashier. Most o fthe Project's accountingtransactions will take place at the
RegionaVzoba level. Each o fthe six zobas will be requiredto have a Project Accountant (to be
known as Finance Officers) who should have at least a diploma inaccounting. These zoba
Project Accountants are yet to be assigned. The Government will deploy six zoba Finance
Officers (one for each o f the six zobas) by the date o f Project Effectiveness. Nevertheless, the
Project will rely on the existing GOE RegionaVzoba and sub-regional staff structures such as
cashiers to support its accounting activities. The Government would also deploy ajunior
accountant and a cashier to the PMT by December 31,2008.

26.      Computer Accounting System: The PMT has an existingtailor-made computer
accounting package which i s deemed adequate for accounting and financial reportingpurposes.
The software is capable o f generating monthly, quarterly and annual financial reports including
trial balance, balance sheet, and income and expenditure statements. The software has also been
installed at all the zoba/Regional PMT offices. The accounts classifications inPMT's Chart o f
Accounts will be updated, and this will be done within one month after project effectiveness.

27.      CapacityBuildingTraining:The Projectwill provide a budget for regular training o f
management, accounts staff and even the communities infinancial management good practices.



                                                   55

The Bank will conduct a fiduciary capacity buildingtraining for the nationalPMT staffby the
time theProject is ready to make the first disbursement.Subsequenttraining will beprovided as
needed. The PMT will be requiredto conduct orientation training o fthe regional PMT and sub-
regional staff infinancial and project management as a precedent to disbursement o f community
grants. The costs o fthese training events will be catered for inthe Project budget for
consultancies and training.

V. INTERNAL CONTROLS

28.      InternalAudit andoversightcommittees: The PMT doesnot have aninternal audit
fknction and there i s no audit committee. This i s the practice inEritrea and it i s a Portfolio-level
issue which is not uniqueto this Project. Given the complex nature o fthe Project design and
intricate procedures for the flow of funds especially to the community level, and internal audit
function i s necessary. After discussions with the implementing agency, it has been agreed that
the Project's external auditors will berequiredto conduct interim internal control reviews(every
six months) and issue systems audit reports, copies o fwhich willbe submittedto the Bank. The
TORSfor the internal control review were preparedbythe PMT and agreedupon at
Negotiations. The external auditor, acceptable to the Bank, will be appointed by October 31,
2008. The first internal control review will be done for the period ended December 31,2008,
andsubsequentreviews will be done for the period ended June 30 andDecember 31during
Project implementation. The relevant reports will be submitted to the PMT by the auditors for
action and copies sent to the Bank within two months o f endo f each half-year (by August 31and
February 28). The cost o f conducting these reviews will come from the Project budget for
consultancies and audit. The implementing agency will be expected to address all internal control
weaknesses raised inthis reports andnotify the Bank accordingly. These interimreviews will be
separate from the annual audit and will focus mainly on the accounting, internal control and
management structures and systems o fthe Project at national, regional, sub-regional and
community levels.

29.      OversightCommittee:As a general rule, Eritrea as a country has not adopted the use o f
oversight committees such as Finance andAudit Committees. However, the PSC and the TSC
will provide the necessary oversight andsupervisionfimctions to the Project. The Ministryo f
FinanceDepartment o f Budget as well as Department o f Public Debt and Investment Division
also provide adequate supervisory oversight.

30.      FMOperatingProcedures:ThePMT's FMoperating procedures are deemed adequate.
The approval and authorizationcontrols over payments are deemed sufficient. A fixed assets
register i s maintained andregularly updated. However, only the motor vehicles are insured. The
rest of the fixed assets are not insured. This is also the accepted government policy for Eritrea.
There i s adequate segregation o f duties inthe accounts section. Nevertheless, the recommended
interim internal control reviews will provide additional assurance o fthe continued effectiveness
o f the internal control systems at the national as well as the regional, sub-regional and
community levels.

31.     FinancialManagementProceduresand PoliciesManual: The PMT is inthe process
o f updating the Project's FinancialManagement Procedures Manual as part o f the PIM. This
Manual was preparedearlier for use byphase Io fthe Project. The Manual does not make any
provisions for budgetary control procedures andvariances analysis. The Manual further needs to
be updated to include World BankProcedures for preparing quarterly IFR, andprocedures under
the report-based method o f disbursement. The PMT will complete updatingo f the FM
Procedures Manual and submit a copy to the Bank for review. Development o f a satisfactory
FMProcedures Manualis a Condition o fProjectEffectiveness.

32.     CommunityGrantsandOVC GrantsManuals.The PMT is also developingthe
Community Grants Manual which will also be translated into the local language, for easier
reference by the local communities. The Manual should include eligibility criteria for villages
andthe procedures for ensuring adherenceto eligibility criteria bythe PMT. Itshould also
include the simplified accounting records for finds handledby the community (e.g., arising from
community investment ventures supported by the project), public reporting and social
accountabilityprocedures, basic audit procedures, and other fundamental financial management
principles. The Community Grants Manual will be completed and a copy submitted to the Bank
for review. Development o f a satisfactory Community Grants Manual i s a Condition o fProject
Effectiveness. The existing OVC Manual will also be updated and adopted by Effectiveness.

33.     Social MonitoringandAccountability: The Project has a community grants scheme
and it is important to set up appropriate mechanisms to ensure adequate community participation
inthe monitoringthe financial management aspectsofthe Project. This canbedonebycreating
structures for public information and reporting. This will ensure that Project financial
management information is promptly disseminated to the community andthat the community
members are able to give feedback on various aspects o f the Project. This canbe achieved by
displaying the community grant budgets, financial statements and audit reports at prominent
places at the zoba headquarters and village meeting places. The community financial statements
shouldbe prepared bythe zoba Accountants using returns submitted by the sub-regional offices.
The reports should be prepared at least once every six months and should be subject to the
interim internal control reviews by the external auditors. The PMT should also make it a
practice to holdregular scheduled meeting with the village committee so as to listen and attend
to the concerns o f the community.

VI.     FINANCIAL REPORTING

34.     Interimun-auditedFinancialReports(IFR): The project has the necessary capacity to
adopt the report-based method o f disbursement. The PMT's accounting system would be usedto
generate quarterly un-audited InterimFinancial Reports (IFR) inform and content satisfactory to
the Bank, which will be submittedto the Bank within 45 days after the end o fthe quarter to
which they relate. This is inline with Bank's FinancialManagement Procedures OPBP 10.02
which makes it mandatory for all Bankprojects to prepare andsubmit quarterly IFRs.The
quarterlyIFRswill beusedas abasis for the disbursement. The PMT has beenpreparing
monthly and quarterly financial reports usingthe existing accounting system and submitting
these to MoF for the GoE finds that they are managing. The most recent reports are for the
month o fMarch2008 andtheir quality is acceptable. The Finance Officer andthe Senior



                                                57

Accountant are deemed competent enough to be able to prepare and submit timely quarterly
IFRs. The computer accounting system has been installed at the national andregional levels and
i s deemed robust enough to meet the financial reporting needs o f the Project. The PMT will
assign more accounts staff to the PMT at boththe national and regionavzobalevels. This will
enhance the capacity o f financial reporting for the Project andmake it possible for the PMT to
adopt the report-based IFRmethod o f disbursement immediately at Project Effectiveness.

35.     Contentof the quarterlyIFR. The IFRswill containthe following minimum
information:

        (a) A statement o f sources and uses o f funds for the reported quarter and cumulatively
              since project inception, reconciledwith bank, cash and other fundbalances at the end
              o f the quarter.
        (b) An analysis o f sources o f funds (receipt) by date and amount for each source.
        (c) An analysis o fuses o f knds (expenditure) byproject expenditure categories and
              components against the budget, with explanations for significant variances.
        (d) An expenditure forecast for the next two quarters (six months) as abasis for justifying
             the amount o f the additional cash replenishment required.
        (e) The Project Account Activity Statement, reconciling the receipts into and payments
             out o fthe project Account.
        ( f ) Supporting bank statements and reconciliations for the bank, cash and other knd
             balances at the end o f the quarter.

36.     The possiblerisks to be monitoredwouldbe delays inreceiving accountability returns
from the regional, and sub-regional for purposes o fpreparing the IFRon time. However this can
be mitigated by having adequate staff (a competent zoba Finance Officer) at the regional levels
and giving sufficient orientation andtraining to the Project staff as to the financial reporting
requirements. The interim internal audit reviews would hrther reveal any weaknesses inthe
system that would create delays andmake recommendations as to the appropriate management
action. It is also expected that the national PMT staffwill make frequent visits to various zobas
andsub-regions to assessthe financialreporting structures as parto fProject implementation.

37.     The PMT, which has overall fiduciary responsibility over the Project, shall ensure that
the IFRs are prepared and submittedto the Bank on time inthe form and content satisfactory to
the Bank.The formats o f the IFRshave been discussed and agreed at Project Negotiations.

Audit Arrangements

38.     AnnualAudited FinancialStatements: Annual audits wouldbe conducted by external
auditors acceptable to the Bank appointed by the borrowers on the basis o f TOR'S reviewedby
the Bank.The audit reports and management letters should be submittedto the Bank as soon as
available but inany case within six months after the end o fthe financial year to which they
relate. The implementing agencies would address and resolve any audit issues raisedby the
auditors inboththe auditors report and the management letter promptly and advise the Bank



                                                  58

accordingly. The Bank has the right under the Financing Covenants to apply remedies for late or
non-submissiono f audit reports andmanagement letters or for failure to address the issues raised
therein. This may include suspension o f disbursements untilthe relevant matter i s resolved.

39.     The audit reporting arrangements are deemed adequate. The audit reports and
management letters for the IECDP Ifor the years ended December 31,2005 and 2006 were
submittedto the Bankwithin the requiredsix months after the endo fthe respective year ends.
The auditors issuedclean (unqualified) audit opinions for bothyears.

40.     Audit CompletionTimetable:The PMT has also committedto aclear timetable for the
completion o f the annual audit andthe submission o fthe audit report and management letter. The
audit reports to be submitted are summarized below:

                    Audit Report                                    Due Date

                ERITREA: IntegratedEarly ChildhoodDevelopmentProjectI1

A. General

1.      Procurement for the proposed project would be carried out inaccordance with the World
Bank's "Guidelines: Procurement under IBRDLoans and IDA Credits" dated May 2004 with
corrigenda October 2006; and "Guidelines: Selection and Employment o f Consultants by World
Bank Recipients" dated May 2004 with corrigenda October 2006, and the provisions stipulated
inthe LegalAgreement. Thevarious itemsunder different expenditure categories aredescribed
ingeneralbelow. For eachcontract to be financed bythe Grant, the different procurement
methods or consultant selection methods, the need for pre-qualification, estimated costs, prior
review requirements, and time frame are agreed betweenthe Recipient andthe Bank inthe
Procurement Plan. The thresholds below are for the purpose o fthe initialprocurement plan. The
Procurement Planwill be updated at least annually or as requiredto reflect the actual project
implementation needs andimprovements ininstitutional capacity.

2.      ProcurementofWorks:There will beno procurement o fWorks under thisproject.

3.      Procurementof Goods: Goods procuredunder this project would mainly include: (i)
micronutrients anddrugs for c-IMCI; (ii)    medical supplies and equipment for the preschool
healthprogram; and (iii)   learning/manipulative materials for the preschool centers. Inthe case o f
medical suppliesand equipment, procurement will be carried out incoordination with
PHARMACOR which assures quality control. Contracts costing the equivalent o fUS$300,000
or more will be procured following ICB procedures. The Bank's current Standard Bidding
Documents for Goods will beused for ICB contracts. National Standard BiddingDocuments
that are acceptable to the Bank may be used for NCB contracts whose value range between the
equivalent o fUS$75,000 or more and less than US$300,000 per contract (Bank Standard
BiddingDocumentsshall be utilized untilsuch time as the National Standard Bidding
Documents are cleared by the Bank). Goods which are estimated to cost less than the equivalent
o fUS$75,000 will be procuredthrough Shopping. On exceptional basis and upon prior
agreement o fthe Bank, Goods may be procured through Direct Contracting.

4.      Selectionof Consultants:Consulting services to beprocuredunder this project would
include few small studies and few training activities inthe different components. Ingeneral,
large consulting assignments will be managed by the PMUand awarded under "Quality and Cost
based selection" (QCBS) procedures with the exception o f assignments o f a standard or routine
nature such as audit assignments, where well established practices and standards exist and Least
Cost selection (LCS) will be used. The remaining consulting contracts will be few relatively
simple assignments below the threshold for prior review. Consulting firms for services estimated
to cost more thanUS$200,000 would be selected through QCBS. Consulting firms for services
estimated to cost less than US$200,000 maybe selected usingthe consultant's qualification
method. Individual consultants will be selected on the basis o ftheir qualifications inaccordance
with the procedures o f articles 5.1 to 5.4 o fthe Bank's Consultant Guidelines anddetailed inthe
Procurement Manual. Single source selection may be used where it can bejustified. Short lists
o f consultants for services estimated to cost less than US$lOO,OOO equivalent per contract may


                                                   66

be composed entirely o f national consultants inaccordance with the provisions o fparagraph 2.7
o fthe Consultant Guidelines. Inthe event that there i s a need, for capacity reasons, UNagencies
andNGOscouldbe selected to assist where they have advantage over commercial firms.

5.       OperatingCosts: The operating costs ofIECD I1shall consist ofPMT's expenses such
as coordination o f cross-cutting activities and general supervisioncosts including office supplies,
operation andmaintenance costs for vehicles, andutility expenses among others.

6.       Others:The grants -to bemanagedbythe zoba administration - represent the: (i)
sustainability grants for communities on the basis o f an approved business planwith the aim o f
attaining financial independency bythe endo f the project; and (ii)    the OVC grants the reunified
households receive for income generating purpose that will go towards covering the extra
expenses o f the reunited orphans. The goods and consultants' services to be financed from the
proceeds o fthe OVC Grant shall be procuredby the Village committees inaccordance with
procedures for ensuring efficiency and economy and inaccordance with the provisions o f
Schedule 2, Section I11o f the FinancingAgreement 7. The procurement procedures and SBDs to
be used for each procurement method, as well as model contracts for goods procured, are
presented inthe Project ImplementationManual.

B. Assessment of the agency's capacityto implementprocurement

7.       Procurement activities will be carried out centrally bythe M o E through the IECD I1
Project Management Team. The IECD I1i s staffed by a small and effective PMT, and the
procurement h c t i o n i s staffed by a Procurement Officer who has served under IECD to be
supported bythe Project Manager who i s also a procurement specialist. An in-depthassessment
o f the capacity of the Implementing Agency to implement procurement actions for the project
has been carried out inApril 2008. The assessmentreviewedthe organizational structure for
implementing the project and the interactionbetweenthe project's staff responsible for
Procurement Officer andthe Ministry'srelevant central unit for administration andfinance. The
key issues andrisks concerningprocurement and for implementationo fthe project have been
identified and are presented inthe table below. On the basis o fpast experience with this type of
project, the key issue i s procurement o f Works and the risk i s mitigated by ruling it out.

CountryProcurementEnvironment

8.      A Country Procurement Assessment (CPAR) was completedinJune 2002 and a report
submitted to the Government. One o fthe main findings o fthe CPAR i s lack o fprocurement
capacity inEritrea. The CPAR highlightedkeyweaknesses which remain valid, as follows: (i)
the country does not have updated procurement systems and procedures inline with
intemationaVacceptable practices; (ii) institutional capacity i s weak; (iii)the centralized
                                          the
public procurement o f goods has its effects on open competition; (iv) market not operating
efficiently, etc. The report incorporated an actionplanfor implementing recommendations for
reforming the procurement systeminEritrea. An IDF grant was approved inMay 16,2003 to
assist the Government inimplementing these reforms. The expected outputs o fthe IDF grant
were procurement legislation; procurement regulations, standard biddingdocuments; and
guidelines for establishing an institutional framework which i s weak at the moment and needs



                                                 67

improving. Unfortunately, the IDFwas closed on May 25,2006 due to lack o fprogress. IECDII
is being implemented under the same arrangement o fthe successfully completed IECDIand with
the same people.

9.      Since the recommendations o fthe CPAR were not fully implemented, an appropriate
legal andregulatory framework, an acceptable procurement Regulations and Procedures and
national standard bidding documents are not yet inplace. IECD will continue usingthe Bank's
SBDs for ICB contracts but for NCB a revised SBD will have to be prepared and submittedto
the Bank for review becausethe current SBD i s based on the old Guidelines while IECD I1will
use the new (May 2004 revised October 2006) Guidelines.

Institutional arrangements

10.    As mentionedabove, IECDI1is a direct continuation o fIECD andhencewill be able to
count on a well experienced PMT consisting o f a Manager, a Procurement Officer anda Finance
Officer and working closely with a procurement agent ( PHARMACOR) which assures quality
control on medical supplies and equipment The decentralized implementation mode will also be
retained through the zoba, sub-zoba and Village Administrator. Day-to-day project management
responsibilitieswill be handledbythe existing PMT inthe Ministryo f Education. The PMT will
be responsible for budget preparation and planning, flow o f funds to the regions, accounting,
procurement, andmanagement o fthe grant from IDA, ensuring compliance with the
Development Grant Agreement (DGA). The roles and responsibilitieso fthe staffwho are
involved inthe procurement process, terms o freference havebeen included inthe
ImplementationManual.

11.    Executing agencies. The Ministry o f Education supported by the Ministry o fHealth and
the Ministryo f Labor andHumanWelfare.

12.    Project oversight and policy guidance. The Policy Steering Committee formed under
the previous project willberesponsible for policy decisions onproject activities. This will be
chaired by the M o E and will include members o fthe M o H and MoLHW.

The overall residual project risk for procurement i s Substantial.

Benefitsof EarlyChildhoodDevelopment

1.      A child's ability to think, form relationships, andlive upto his or her fillpotential is
directly relatedto the synergistic effect o f good health, good nutrition, and appropriate
stimulation andinteraction with others. A largebody o f research has proven the importance o f
early brain development and the need for good health and nutrition inthe early years.
Malnutrition can slow down brain development, impair child's ability to learn, harmintellectual
ability and social skills development. Malnutrition is also related to delayed school enrollment
andlow school performance.

2.      A healthy cognitive and emotional development inthe early years translates into tangible
economic returns. Earlyinterventions yield higher returns as a preventive measure compared
with remedial services later inlife. Policies that seek to remedy deficits incurred inthe early
years are muchmore costly thaninitial investments inthe early years. Finally, the body of
research and evidence on the far reaching consequences o fmalnutrition is so impressive that it
promptedRepositioning Nutrition as Central to Development (World Bank, 2006) to argue that
no MDGcanbe reached unless malnutritioni s addressed.

3,      Differences inearly childhood development outcomes often have lifetime impact on
social and economic status o fthe individuals. There are about 700,000 children six years o f age
and under today inEritrea12, including over 80 percent living inrural areas. As low income
levels are often positively relatedto women's higher fertility rate and largerhousehold size, there
are disproportionatelymore poor children than adults. These children from poor and rural
families are more likely to suffer from malnutrition, illness or to low school performance, which
inturnis likelyto leadto lower income andhumandevelopment level inlater life as the diagram
inFigure 1below illustrates. Ifthe intergenerational cycle o fpoverty is to behalted, children
particularly at risk deserve special attention and support intheir development.

Economicrationalefor GovernmentalinvolvementinEarly ChildhoodDevelopment

Theoretical foundation

4.      Recognizing the importance of early childhood development of preparing children for
better education performance, improving future productivity andother social outcome for the
lifetime, the GoEhas committed to increasingthe participationrate, improving quality, and
enabling wider service provision. An economic case for government intervention inearly


                                                    72

childhood education can be made on the grounds o f equity andpoverty reduction. The most
significant benefit o f government investmentinECD program is the leveled starting ground for
the disadvantaged children, ensuring they have an equal opportunity to achieve higher human
development levels and earnings potential inlater life, which would leadto the break o f
intergenerational cycle o f poverty thus loweredoverall poverty rate inthe future. A second
broadjustification for government intervention inearly childhood education is that there are
marketfailure inthis areaincluding liquidityconstraints, incomplete information, and
externalities. Liquidityconstraints may prevent parents from makingoptimal investments inthe
humancapitalo ftheir children. Informationonchild-care provisionis also asymmetric inmany
cases. The government can improve outcomes by developing, publicizing and
enforcing standards. A thirdjustification could be made on the basis o f cost-effectiveness o f
such interventions. People who start out with very unequal endowments interms o fwealth,
ability, andopportunities are likely to endup with very unequal outcomes. A government which
i s concerned with equity can compensate the differences in final outcomes. Inaddition,
improved child outcome can also reduce overall cost to the society by, for example, reducing
crime rate and reducing the number o fwelfare receivers.

Impact o f Interventions: Empirical Evidence

5.      The available evidence suggests that the benefits o f early intervention are greater
for more disadvantaged children. For example, an evaluationo fthe Carolina Abecedarian project
shows that the positive effects o fthe program are twice as large for children from the poorest and
least educated families. Many findings suggest that the payoffto early intervention i s greatest
for the most disadvantaged children. A study o f a program inIndia also shows that the program
helpedreduce the dropout rate o fthepoorest childrenby 46 percent (Chaturvedi et al. 1987),
while hardly affected that o fthe richer children. Earlychildhood development public programs
have shown significant impact indeveloped countries. Inthe United States, for example, the
"Carolina Abecedarian Project'' found that the children who had received the preschool
intervention hadhigher scores on achievement test andreductioninthe incidence o f grade
repetition and special education. The "Perry Preschool Project'' shows that the project has
significant on achievement test scores, grades, highschool graduation rates, and earnings, as well
as negative effects on crime rates and welfare use. "Head Start", a larger scale public preschool
program for disadvantaged children has also shown long-term impact on earningswhen
participants reach adulthood (Graces, Thomas and Currie, 2002, AERYVol. 92, No. 4 (Sept,
2002) 999-1012).

6.      Not addressing malnutrition has highcosts inlostGDP andhigherbudgetoutlays.
Malnutrition costs low-income countries billions o f dollars a year. At the country level, it has
been estimated that obesity andrelated NCDs cost China about 2 percent o f GDP and
inIndiaproductivity losses(manual work only) from stunting,iodinedeficiency, andiron
deficiency together are responsible for a loss o f 2.95 percent o f GDP. Preventingmicronutrient
deficiencies alone inChina will beworth betweenUS$2.5 andUS$5 billion annually in
increased GDP, which represents 0.2 to 0.4 percent o f annual GDP inChina. Other studies have
suggested that micronutrient deficiencies alone may cost IndiaUS$2.5 billion annually, about
0.4 percent o fIndia's annual GDP. One estimate suggests that the productivity losses inIndia
associated with malnutrition, iron deficiency anemia, and iodine deficiency disorders (IDD), in



                                                 73

the absence o f appropriate interventions, will amount to about US$114 billionbetween 2003 and
2012 (India's annual GDP i s about US$601 billion). Another study, examining only the
productivity losses associatedwith forgone wage employment resultingfrom child malnutrition,
estimates the loss at US$2.3 billion inIndia (0.4 percent o f annual GDP). InSierra Leone, lack
o f adequate policies and programs to address anemia among women will result inagricultural
productivity losses among the female labor force exceeding US$94.5 million over the next five
years. Malnourished children require more health services andmore expensive types of care
than other children. They have poorer schooling outcomes andmay repeat years more often,
thus increasing education costs. Developing countries are also spending an average o f 2 to 7
percent o ftheir health care budgets on direct costs for treatment o f obesity andassociated
chronic diseases. All of these costs fall largelyon governments, which provide extensive public
sector financing for health and education for the poor.

Projectanalysis

Benefit-cost analysis

7.       Consideringthe long-term nature o f investments inyoung children, the program in
Eritrea will have to continue being sustained for a long time before it can be evaluated for its
long-term benefits. However, as documented bythe Copenhagen Consensus, the expected rates
o f returns from investinginnutrition are high. Compared with manypossible development
investments, including trade reform and private sector deregulation, malaria eradication, and
water and sanitation, the provision o fmicronutrients was identified as the second best
opportunity for meeting the world's development challenges (see Table 1below for examples of
benefit-cost ratios).

The benefits o fECEprograms canbeclassifiedinshort-, medium-,andlong-term. The short-
term and direct benefits include improved health andnutrition, prevention o f abuse andneglect,
andbenefits to other family membersincludingparents andsiblings.Medium-termbenefits
include preventing special education, and preventing grade repetition and drop-out inprimary
school. Long-term benefits include improvement inschool attainment and wages as well as
reduction incrime. The most significant and measurable benefiti s the education benefit inthe
medium term and improved labor earnings inthe longer term.

Cost-Effectiveness Analysis

8.       Inthe areaofEarlyChildhoodEducation andCare, thepreviousproject implementedtwo
different approaches -the Kindergartens (KGs) and the Community Care Giver (CCG)
approach. Though conceptually the CCG was to be a non-formal outreach service to be provided
at community level, inreality the demand for center based pre-school services was so highthat
parents/communities organized a space for Community Care Giver to provide developmental
activities for children. These centers were set up at a fraction o fthe cost o f setting up formal
KGs. Interms o fthe outcome, it is well knownthat healthy adult childinteraction is the most
crucial o f the inputs.While a well organized physical environment like building, equipment and
furniture are conducive for learning, ina resource constrained situation, it i sjustifiable to reach
more number o f children with a less expensive model than limit the access to a few because o f
the highcost o f formal KG facility.

9.       Inthe areaofproviding care andprotectionfor childrenwith special needs, Eritreahad
already a very successful model o freintegration o f orphans into immediate/extended families
with economic support to the host families. Thismodelnot only provides psychosocialsupport
that i s as close to a naturalhome for children, but i s also very cost effective compared to
institutional care for children. Future operations are also expected to follow this model and
strengthening the support systems that help the host families.

10.      The nutrition outcome was not realized fully inthe Project areas, but disaggregated data
showed that the results varied widely among the different zobas. Inthe HH/C-IMCI and GMP
pilot areas the reduction was most significant at 27 percent indicating to a clear advantage in
integrating both approaches. Interms o f actual grassroots level volunteers to be involved inthe
follow-up operation, the GoE andits development partners have been developing a cost-effective
model that combines the resources o fHWC-IMCI and GMP approaches at community, sub-zoba
andzoba levels to address allhealth, food security, feeding and caring practices inanintegrated
manner.

11.      Regarding supervision andmonitoring for all services to children, the integrated service
delivery model that was adopted after midterm review under IECD for implementing the
activities inthe ECD village also opened up opportunities for joint planning, training,
supervision and monitoringbythe working groups at the zoba level. Ina resource constraint
situation, apart from helping inconvergence o f services, thejoint supervision also madebest use
o f limited resources likevehicles and fuel.

12.      Provision o fECD services to children with special needs didnot receive sufficient
priority inIECD, except for those orphans reintegrated by the Ministry o f Labor and Human
Welfare. For instance, early detection o f disabilities and community based re-habilitation,
awareness generation on learning disabilities andtraining to teachers on helping children with
such disabilities are areas the project didnot address and the GoE envisages addressing them
through the pre-schoolhealthprogram inthe proposed IECD 11.

1.     As with the IECD, the project is expectedto berated `Cy,with no significant
environmental and social impact, and no safeguardpolicy is triggered.

2.     The program is likely to have apositive social impact because it aims to contributeto the
improvedhealth anddevelopment o fyoung children. It also seeks to promote equityby
emphasizing services geared towards rural, under-served areas, as well as disadvantaged
groups, including orphans and childrenwith disabilities, Health and ECE interventionswill also
seek to target the nomadic populations (about 30 percent o f the total population inEritrea i s
composed o f agro-pastoralists). The M o Hwill expand its present I M C Iprogram and MoE will
also focus on establishing appropriate ECE interventionsinrural areas.

3.     Inthe design ofthe community grants scheme, communities havecontinuedto be
consulted. Duringthe preparationo fthe IECD 11, the community grants scheme and the results
framework were discussed ina workshop with some 40 zoba level officers from all sectors.
Duringimplementation, communities will beinthe `driver seat' with respect to implementing
the community grants after being trained inbuildinggroup cohesiveness and inbusiness
activity start-up. Project preparationhas involved the participationo f the ministries o f
Education, Health, and Labor as well as the PMT staff, The project has been discussed with key
external partners such as the EC andUNICEF.

4.    The project will benefitthe target group o f about 132,000 Eritreanyoung children aged
six and under. Itwill also benefit mothers, caregivers, families, children facing difficult
circumstances, teachers, social workers, andhealth workers.
