APPRAISAL OF THE MARIMBONDO HYDROELECTRIC PLANT AND TRANSMISSION
LINES AND OTHER GENERATING EQUIPMENT
OF CENTRAL ELETRICA DE FURNAS S.A.
SUMMARY AND CONCLUSIONS
i.        This report covers the appraisal of a project of Central
Eletrica de Furnas S.A. (Furnas) consisting of the construction of the
1,400 Mw Marimbondo hydroelectric plant, associated transmission between
the plant and Rio de Janeiro, and 300 Mw turbo-generator capacity in the
existing Furnas plant. The project 'J5 estimated to cost US$287 million
equivalent; the proposed external firlancing would amount to US$106 million
equivalent, of which US$80 million is proposed to be provided by a Bank
loan and US$26 million by major industrialized countries under joint finan-
cing arrangements described herein. Brazilian industry would compete for
equipment orders as under previous loans and, with a 15% margin of preference,
is expected to win considerable contracts which would be eligible for Bank
financing. The project is a part of the overall expansion program of Furnas,
the total cost of which is estimated at US$1,250 million during the 10-year
period 1969-1978, some 15% to 20% of the total sector requirement.
ii.       Total Bank lending for the electric power sector in Brazil has
been US$542 million. The sector is highly concentrated in the south-central
region which is the industrial heart of the country, using 80% of all electric
power produced. Furnas is an important generator and transmitter of power
in this region.
iii.      The Borrower would be Furnas, an autonomous electric utility
corporation owned principally by the Federal Government. Four previous
Bank loans, totalling US$191.3 million, have been made to Furnas for the
construction of three hydroelectric stations and associated transmission.
The first of these has been in commercial operation since 1963, the second
is in commercial operation although construction is not yet complete, and
site preparation and construction plant mobilization is in progress on the
third. Construction schedules have been well-maintained and cost estimates
have not been exceeded.
iv.       The project is technically sound.  Its estimated cost, the proposed
construction schedule and the proposed financial plan are reasonable. The
facilities to be provided are required to enable Furnas to meet its part of
the expected demand for power in the south-central region of Brazil for which
an intensive power market study through 1985 has recently been completed by
Centrais Eletricas Brasileiras S.A. (Eletrobras), a holding company which
implements Government policy in the electric power sector. The study has
been reviewed in the Bank and found to form a satisfactory basis for judging
the need for the proposed project.



v.         The project has been shown to be the least-cost alternative
to add to the Furnas system in a report prepared by Furnas' consultants.
The discount rates equating the costs of alternatives are 124 and 16%
per annum, respectively, for a combination thermalAiydro alternative and
a full-thermal alternative. The incremental rate of return for the Marim-
bondo plant and transmission is 20% and for the additional capacity in the
Furnas plant is not less than 24%, Which are satisfactory.
vi.        Furnas is a suitable Borrower. Since its inception in 1957,
the organization has developed well. With the assistance of its well-
qualified consultants, Furnas should be able to accomplish the work satis-
factorily. It has maintained a satisfactory financial position, taking
full advantage of favorable tariff regulations in Brazil.
vii.       The project is a suitable basis for a Bank loan of US$80
million equivalent for 30 years, including a grace period of 7i years.
Under the proposed joint financing arrangements, the balance of the ex-
ternal financing required of US$26 million equivalent would be provided
through credits arranged between Fbrnas and major supplier countries.
Contracts would be awarded to low bidders after international competitive
bidding without taking financing terms into account.

APPRAISAL OF THE MARIMBONDO HYDROELECTRIC PLANT AND TRANSMISSION
LINES AND OTHER GENERATING EQUIPMENT
OF CENTRAL ELETRICA DE FURNAS S.A.
I. INTRODUCTION
1.01        Central Eletrica de Furnas  S.A. (Furnas), a corporation almost
wholly owned by the Federal Government, has requested a Bank loan of US$80
million equivalent to cover a part of the required external financing for a
project whose total cost is estimated to be US$287 million. The remaining
part of the external financing of US$26 million equivalent would be provided
by major industrialized countries under arrangements for joint financing
described below in paragraph 5.10. Tine project would form a part of the
Furnas program for meeting the increasing demand for electrical energy which
over the next 10 years will require arnual investments of the order of US$125
million equivalent, some 15% to 20% oL the total sector requirement.
1.02        The project would consist of construction of --
i)  the 1,400 Mw Marimbondo hydroelectric plant on the
Rio Grande River;
ii)  two single-circuit 500 kv transmission lines, with a
total length of 1,400 km, between the plant and Rio
de Janeiro; and
iii)  two 150 Mw turbo-generator units for installation in
the existing Furnas hydroelectric plant.
This would be the fifth Bank loan to Furnas, each of the preceding loans
having financed a hydroelectric plant on the Rio Grande, or related trans-
mission, or both: (a) Loan 211-BR (1958) for US$73 million for the 900 Mw Furnas
plant 1/; (b) Loan h03-BR (1965) for US$57 million for the 1,050 Mw Estreito
plant; (c) Loan 474-BR (1966) for US$39 million for the Estreito transmission;
and (d) Loan 565-BR (1968) for US$22.3 million for the 360 Mw Porto Colombia
plant. The first two plants are in service; there have been some construction
problems at some of the plants but there are no problems of any importance at
present. Work on the Porto Colombia project has covered the first steps for
equipment procurement, site preparation including roads and housing, and the
mobilization and erection of construction plant. All of the projects except
the 900 Mw Furnas plant were studied between 1963 and 1966 under a United
Nations Development Programme (UNDP) grant whose objective was the creation of
a long-range expansion program for electric facilities in Brazil's south-central
region. The Bank was the Executing Agency for the study.
1.03        This report is based on the findings of a Bank mission comprised
of Messrs. R. L. Bloor, M. J. Reis and M. J. Schloss, who visited Brazil in
October/November 1969.

at Furnas Falls.



1.0L          The Government's policy has been to rnake small adjustLiw!nLs ir
the exchange rate every 30 to 60 days.  At the time of preparation of thn
basic data for this report, a rate of NCr$3.83 to US$1 was in efclh: the
present exchange rate is NCr$h.h9 to Us$l.  Changes in the exchanrge rate
do not affect the Borrower's financial position as they are offset L)y tariff
adjustmernts, and hence, do not require frequent recasting of the financial
statements.



II. SECTOR DEVELOPMENT
2.01        Most electric power in Brazil is produced by government entities,
but there is substantial private production. In 1968 the total installed
capacity of 8,741 Mw was distributed as follows:
Federal Government                    18%
State Governments                     39%
Private (including captive plants)  43%
Future expansion of the sector in generation and transmission will be prac-
tically all by Government companies ax 1 by 1975 they will represent about 80%
of the total capacity.  Production va:.es greatly in the different sections of
the country, as indicated below:
Northeast                             11%
North and Nest-Central                 1%
South-Central                         77r%
South                                 11%
Total production in 1968 was about 39 billion kwh or 425 kwh per capita,
whereas in the South-central section production was 760 kwh per capita --
a rate comparable to some of the lower national rates in Europe.
2.02        The Government sector is headed by Eletrobras, a Federal limited
liability holding company created in 1961 to implement Government policy in the
electric power sector. Eletrobras is the majority stockholder in its 16 sub-
sidiary (Federal) companies, and a minor stockholder in 19 associated companies
controlled by State Governments. It administers public funds to expand the
Federal power systems and makes loans to other utilities in need of financing.
2.03        The south-central region, which includes the states of Sao Paulo,
Minas Gerais, Rio de Janeiro, Guanabara, Espirito Santo and Goias, contains
45% oI the country's population although only 13% of its area, accounts for
40% of its agricultural production and 70% of its industrial production, and
consumed in 1968 about 25 billion kwh of electricity or about 80% of the
country's total consumption. The principal generating companies in the region
are --
Central Eletrica de Furnas S.A. (Furnas),
Centrais Eletricas de Sao Paulo S.A. (CESP)
the State-owned company of Sao Paulo,
Centrais Eletricas de Minas Gerais S.A. (CEMIG)
the State-owned company of Minas Gerais, and
Light Servicos de Eletricidade S.A. (Light)
a subsidiary of a Canadian company.
These companies are interconnected by a transmission system (see Map) and up
until now the principal inter-company movement of power has been from Furnas
to Light. CESP is beginning to bring in large sources of power and in the
future will supply a large part of the Sao Paulo market; Furnas will be the
principal supplier of the Rio de Janeiro area; CEMIG will supply the state of
Minas Gerais; and there will be some interchanges among the companies. Light
will not expand its generating facilities, but will continue to be the principal
distributor in the Sao Paulo and Rio de Janeiro areas.



2.o4        The study under the UNDP grant mentioned in paragraph 1.02 was
undertaken by a consortium of consulting engineering firms 1/, and yielded
a program for the region's power development through 1980 when, based on an
intensive market study, consumption of at least 65 billion kwh was expected.
The program is predominantly hydroelectric since there are many such sites
that can be developed at low unit cost, whereas the known indigenous fossil
fuels are either scarce or of poor quality and remote from the region. All
the companies have adhered to the program and are expected to continue doing
so; all features of the proposed project are parts of the program.          of
Sao Paulo was committed so heavily to a program of its own when the UNDP
study was initiated in 1963 that it has not yet started a project un'er the
program, but plans to do so soon. Its plants now under construction fit into
the program satisfactorily although the transmission voltage it selected,
while workable, will not represent the most economical solution.
2.05        During the past year, Eletrobras made a market study of the south-
central region to update the development program, which is based on data about
five years old. The company was assisted by well-qualified consultants who
had worked on the UNDP study. The final report on this market study is now
available and it indicates total consumption of at least 75 billion kwh in
1980. The report is judged to be a satisfactory basis for the region's ex-
pansion programs. The particular assumptions regarding the market which
serve as a basis for appraising the proposed project are set forth in para-
graphs 7.02 and 7.03 herein. The program will require periodic review as the
actual market develops.
2.06        Although Furnas, CEMIG and CESP each has a fairly definite area
of responsibility for the future supply of electricity, the transmission grid
makes it possible for them all to obtain substantial advantages from coordi-
nated operation. Furnas has taken the lead in organizing a Committee for the
Coordination of Integrated Operation, which includes the nine companies oper-
ating in the south-central region and its fringe areas. This Committee meets
regularly to consider such matters as --
i) coordination of reservoir storage operations;
ii) system planning for reserve capacity;
iii) establishment of system maintenance programs;
iv) procedures for load and frequency control;
v) planning for operations during emergencies;
vi) establishment of system communication facilities;
vii) standardization of statistical information and
coordination of technical studies.
Although new, the Committee is organized along lines that have been success-
ful elsewhere and it may be expected to achieve for the region a high quality
of service at low cost.

2.07        The development of distribution systems conmensurate with the
expansion of generating and transmission facilities is proceeding reasonably
well. Four Bank loans (475 - 478-BR) totalling us$6i.6 million are helping
finance the rehabilitation and expansion of four major systems in the south-
central region.  For several years, an AID loan of US$h0 million to Light
has helped finance a progran of distribution improvement in the cities of
Rio de Janeiro and Sao Paulo.  Using its own funds, Light is about to embark
on a five-year plan designed to stay abreast of market growth.  CEMIG is
undertaking a major expansion of its distribution system in Minas Gerais.
All the other companies in the region are actively engaged in or planning
the early start of similar programs. With the improved earnings based on
revalued assets permit-ted the utilities since 1964, there is little doubt
that the distribution systems will be improved and expanded toward adequate
levels.  System losses of 14O% in 196-8 are expected to be reduced to 11% in
180, a quite satisfactory level, due principally to improverment in distri-
bution systems.

III.   THE BORROWER
3.01        The Borrower would be Furnas, an autonomous Government corpora-
tion established in 1957 and the largest subsidiary of Eletrobras. Furnas
is a bulk producer and sells only to other utilities at wholesale. It is
a major supplier for the Rio de Janeiro market through Light and several
smaller distributors, for the Sao Paulo market through Light and one other
small company and it sells to CEMIG. Its principal source of energy is
large hydroelectric plants it has constructed on the Rio Grande several
hundred kilometers from its markets; and it has built an extensive high-
voltage transmission system to reach these markets.
3.02        The share capital of Furnas as established on June 6, 1969,
was NCr$600 million, divided as follows:

3.03        A 12-member council appointed by the Government directs Furnas.
Six of the members are executive directors, and the other six are in
Government and business circles.  The executive directors are the President,
the Vice President (Technical), the Vice President (Operations and Planning),
and the three heads of the Departments of Administration, Finance, and
Contracts. The personnel are distributed as follows:
Department                   No. of Personnel
Technical                      1,000 (750 in construction)
Operations and Planning        1,000
Administration                   370
Finance                          170
Contracts                        135
Total     2,675



-7-
The number of personnel is not excessive. Furnas does a considerable amount
of construction work with its own forces, such as preparatory work at cons-
truction sites which would be difficult to accomplish by contract. Further-
more, many of its personnel do work which ordinarily would be done in govern-
ment bureaus, such as organizing the coordinated operation of all utilities
in the region and assisting in the preparation of tariff regulations, market
studies, and the solution of other country-wide utility problems.
3.04        The organization of Furnas has developed well -- due partly to
a well-informed, hard-working group of executive directors and partly to
the technical and financial assistanr. G furnished by the Bank and other
development financing institutions. All of the Bank loans have included
funds for personnel training, as does the proposed loan. Some 20 employees
annually are sent to the United States and to European countries for grad-
uate study and practical training in the technical and financial fields with
large utility enterprises, manufacturing companies and government bureaus.
In addition, Furnas has converted some of the buildings in the construction
village at the Furnas Dam into a training school for operating and maintenance
technicians, who are drawn from its own organization as well as from other
utilities in Brazil. For the design and construction of major projects,
Furnas employs consulting engineers and hires contractors.
3.05        All power generated by Furnas is sold under contract to other
itilities for resale to the ultimate consumers. The utilities which pur-
chase Furnas power and the amounts of recorded and projected sales are
listed in Annex 1. In 1968, the last year for which nationwide figures
are available, Furnas energy sales were nearly 6.0 billion kwh and the
demand was 1,260 Mw. Total energy sales in the south-central region for
that year were 21 billion kwh.

IV. GENERATING EXPANSION PROGRAM
4.01         As shown in paragraph 3.06, the Furnas Corporation has 2,010
Mw of capacity in operation and 960 Mw under construction to be completed
by 1972. The Porto Colombia units will come on line in 1973 and 1974h, but
in order to avoid a shortage in reserve capacity in those years the Cor-
poration plans to install in the Furnas powerhouse units Nos. 7 and 8 of
150 Mw each in the spaces available for them. The 1,400 Mw of Marimbondo
is scheduled to come in starting in 1975 and to be completed early in 1977.
Furnas has been given the responsibility by the Government to construct
Brazil's first nuclear plant (about 5^0O Mw); several sites in the vicinity
of Rio de Janeiro are being explored. The year 1976 has been mentioned as
the date for completion of the nuclear plant, but full commercial operation
is not considered likely before 1978; this later date appears to be satis-
factory with respect to Furnas' ability to meet its market requirements.
While a nuclear plant of this size may be economic in many systems of this
size, its justification in Brazil is not clear on account of the availability
of abundant low-cost hydro potentials extending well into the 1980's. Pre-
sent plans are to finance it by tied foreign credits and government funds;
and the Bank has reserved the right to assure itself that a satisfactory
financing plan is adopted for the construction of this or any other project
which may be started before the proposed Marimbondo project is completed.
As it is expected that another new power plant will be needed early in 1979,
the present plan is to build the Itumbiara hydroelectric plant of about 1,000
Mw on the Paranaiba River during 1974-1978. Furnas expects that another plant
of about 1,000 Mw will then need to be constructed over the 1975-1980 period.
This program aside from the Marimbondo plant will require further study before
each additional plant is started, since the market requirements may deviate
somewhat from present estimates.

V. THE PROJECT
5.01        The project would consist of the construction of the 1,400 Mw
Marimbondo hydroelectric plant on the Rio Grande, a transmission system a-t
500 kv and 1,400 km long, and the installation of two 1'0O Mw,l turbo-g-enerator
units in the existing Furnas plant.  Included in the project would he3 forei,run
engineering, training and managerial services plus the related equipino-2nt.
Marimbondo Hydroelectric Plant
5.02        The plant will be situated 650 km northwest of Rio de Jameiro
at Marimbondo Falls, about 250 km above the mouth of the Rio Grande 1!her
it joins the Paranaiba River to form the Parana River. With a drainagec
area of 118,600 km2 and a gross head of 60 m, Marimbondo will be the largest
vlant on the river. Like other plant.s under construction upstream, it will
benefit from the regulation of flow provided by the large volume of storage
at the existing Peixoto and Furnas plants.
5.03        The main features of the structure will be --
i)  an earth embankment, 3,500 m long with a maximum
height of 65 m and with a volume of 20 million m3;
ii)  a gated concrete chute spillway, 150 m wide; and
iii)  a powerhouse intake s-tructure connected by short
steel penstocks to an enclosed, above-ground power-
house 220 m long.
Construction will be simple except for the extensive cofferdain system recquired
by the peculiar topography of the falls. The earth and rock cofferdam struc-
tures will have to be built in fairly deep water. Though this has been done
before under more adverse conditions, a well-organized and adequately super-
vised construction effort will be needed. The Brazilian construction indus-try
will be called upon to do the work and with the supervision of the Furnas
organization it is fully capable of this; furthermore, the project cost esti-
mates include contingency allowances that should be able to cover construction
difficulties.
5.04        The powerhouse will have eight 175 MwJ units. The plant factcr would be
40h  with an annual firm energy capability of some h.9 billion kwh under driest
season conditions as experienced during the 1953-56 drought. These relation-
ships are optimal based on a study of needs of the entire Furnas system.  The
station will utilize Francis-type turbines suitable to the moderate head.
Transmission
5.05        The fact that the Marimbondo plant will be the largest on the
Rio Grande, as well as the farthest from the market, calls for the construction
of an extra high voltage transmission system to be superimposed over the present



- 11 -
345 kv system. Various layouts have been studied, with the best one shown
on the attached map. Basically, the system connects Marimbondo with Rio de
Janeiro (its principal market) by two single-circuit lines totalling some
1,h00 km and by 1,200 Mva of transformers in the capital city; its routing
also makes possible economic interconnections to the CEMIG area to the north,
and the CESP area to the south.
5.06        Transmission at 500 kv is a relatively new and high voltage.
For some years, however, it has been in service in the United States over
long distances and the equipment has been designed and produced by several
manufacturers. Furnas personnel will be trained in its operation elsewhere
and experienced consultants will be available when operations begin. Thus,
no problems regarding its use in south-central Brazil are expected.
Furnas Turbo-Generator Units 7 and 8
5.07        The Furnas powerhouse has six 150 Mw units in operation, and
there are spaces for two more of the same size. Since practically all the
equipment needed to install the two units, Nos. 7 and 8, such as the travel-
ling cranes, closure gates, and bulkheads, is already built into the power-
house, no problems are anticipated.
Engineering, Training and Managerial Services
5.08        These services are needed by Furnas as its system becomes in-
creasingly complex and they must be obtained from abroad since the system
is the most advanced of its kind in Brazil. Being the outstanding Federal
utility, it must assume the leadership by training personnel abroad and
achieving improvements in management and integrated operation with adjacent
systems, to include load dispatching and computerized problem-solving, along
with equipment for such operations.

- 12 -
The to+al cost of US$286.7 million equivalent does not include interest
during construction. Contirngency allowances vary from about 7.5% on equip-
ment proposed for external financing to about 17.5% on the local costs of
the Marimbondo plant which include the civil works. The US$52.0 (57.7 minus
5.7) million of foreign currency for equipment is the estimated cost of im-
ports comprising finished goods, components, and raw materials.
External Financing
5.10         The requirement of US$106 million equivalent in external finan-
cing includes about US$100 million which is the estimated cost of equipment
to be purchased after international competitive bidding including contracts
won by Brazilian suppliers. These are estimated to amount to nearly one-
half of the total contracts on the basis of recent experience with similar
loans in Brazil. External financing would be provided by joint financing
between the Bank and major industrialized countries as agreed at a meeting
in Paris on March 11 and 12, 1970. The pattern of financing would be similar
to that used for the Colombian Loans 536-co, 537-CO, and 575-Co. A major
difference in results would be that in this case, and on the basis of recent
experience, Brazilians would be expected to secure a substantial part of the
equipment orders, as noted above, and these would be financed by the Bank.
Otherwise, financing for equipment would be provided on a 50/50 basis between
the Bank and the countries in which contracts are placed provided that:
Individual contracts amount to at least the equivalent
of US$200,000 to qualify for joint financing; and
any one country must receive qualifying contracts
aggregating at least the equivalent of US$1 million
before being called upon to participate in joint
financing.
Foreign engineering, training, technical, and managerial improvement services
and related equipment would be financed by the Bank. Joint financing is ex-
pected to occur along the following lines:

Tlus the proposed Bank loan would be us$80 million equivalent and the pro-
posed financing by other lenders is estimated at US$26 million equivalent.
The proposed Borroiwer has agreed to make its best efforts to obtain joint
loans. If the other lenders should secure contracts which qualify for
joint lending and total more than US$26 million, the amount of Bank finan-
cing could be reduced and a corresponding amount of the loan could be can-
celled. Agreement has been reached with the Borrower that prematuring of
a joint loan because of a default would give the Bank the right to declare
a default under the Bank loan.
Unit Costs
5.11        The cost per kw of the M.arimbondo plant, due to favorable natural
conditions, is only US$115, which is very low compared with the average cost
of this type of hydroelectric plant. Together with the transmission system
the cost is under US$200 per kw, which is likewise a very low unit cost con-
sidering that a part of the transmission system will also temporarily serve
other plants. The unit cost of Furnas units 7 and 8 is about US$31 per kw;
the lowest unit cost of installing incremental capacity elsewhere in the re-
gion has been estimated at US$44 per kw. The project cost estimate is based
partly on Furnas' recent construction experience and partly on the advice of
its consultants and prospective suppliers, and it is judged to be adequate.
Engineering and Construction
5.12        The engineering group which in 1966 produced a program of power
expansion through 1980 for the south-central region (see paragraph 2.04) re-
cognized that the Marimbondo plant would have one of the lowest cost poten-
tials in the region. However, no basic engineering studies had been made
for it and because of the time required for such studies, other projects
with more complete planning had to be programmed earlier to meet the grow-
ing need for electricity. Since 1966 Furnas has employed two engineering
firms, Charles T. Main (U.S.A.) and Promon Engineering Co. (Brazil), to
proceed with the engineering studies. Individual consultants from the
U.S.A. were also employed for the earth dam design and geological studies.
Detailed studies of the entire system in which the plant will operate have
been made to establish the plant's optimum installed capacity. A satis-
factory report on this study is available. Thus, the general design of the
dam structure is now fixed, the size of the powerhouse is established, an
accurate cost estimate is available, and the detailed design of structures
and equipment is in progress.
5.13        Since it was generally recognized that the construction of Marim-
bondo required a transmission system with a higher voltage level than the
existing system (see paragraph 5.05), a planning group was organized consist-
ing of representatives of Furnas, CEMIG and CESP. Studies were made as to
how the integration of their systems could best be carried forward with regard
to the routing of lines and voltage levels, including the existing 345 kv level
and 500 and 765 kv. The planning group was assisted by Commonwealth Associates,
a U.S.A.firm specializing in transmission planning, and Montreal Engineering Co.
of Brazil (no relation to the Canadian company of the same name). The group
selected a voltage level of 500 kv and the routing of the lines necessary



- 14 -
to carry the output of Marimbondo.  That voltage level was f'ound to be more
economical than 345 kv; 765 kv was found applicable in only part of the region
and furthermore was considered too untried anywhere to be used in Brazil at
this time. The group's findings were reported in detail and are considered
reasonable. Work is now going forward on detailed planning of the structures
and equipment needed.
5.14        The Montreal Engineering Co. of Canada, after studying the need
for Furnas units 7 and 8, prepared a satisfactory report recommending instal-
lation as soon as practicable. The relatively small amount of engineerin>,
required for the design and installation of these units can be supplied by the
Furnas organization itself, assisted as necessary by suppliers.
5.15        Site preparation for Marimbendo has been underway for some time,
and Furnas has started the mobilization of construction equipment. After mid-
1970, Furnas should begin to enter into contracts for the major items of per-
manent equipment; at the same time a major construction contractor should move
onto the job site. It should be practicable to make these arrangements, so
as to ensure the first generating unit coming into operation early in 1975 and
the last one at the beginning of 1977. It should likewise be possible to con-
struct the transmission facilities on a similar schedule, except to have them
completed by the end of 1974.  Furnas unit 7 will be needed late in 1973 aid
unit 8 early in 1974; there should be no problem in meeting those dates. The
well-experienced Furnas organization and its well-qualified consulting firms
should be able to accomplish all of the work satisfactorily and on schedule.
The provisions contained in Loan 565-BR requiring the employment of consultants
and contractors satisfactory to the Bank will be repeated in the proposed
agreement.



- 15 -
VI.  PROCUREMENT AND DISBURSEMENT
6.0o         Procurement for the project will fall within two categories:
i. Permanent equipment to be installed in the
project and certain foreign professional
services which will be covered by the
proposed external financing (including
the proposed Bank loan) and estimated to
cost US$106 million.
ii. The main civil works contracts, which will
not be covered by the proposed external
financing, and estimated to cost approx-
imately US$80 million equivalent.
The remainder of the project cost will be for force account work, land,
local engineering services, operation of construction camps, and admin-
istrative overhead.
6.02         Procurement of goods and services by means of the external finan-
cing would be on the basis of international competitive bidding, with the ex-
ception of some minor items for which such bidding would be impractical, and
the professional services needed for engineering and training. As in the
Bank's previous power loans in Brazil, local manufacturs would be eligible
to compete in the bidding with the advantage of a 15% margin of preference.
In the case of bids composed of both foreign and local currencies the foreign
portion would be dealt with as a foreign bid and the local portion as a local
bid. In the case of joint loans the interest and terms of the loans would be
disregarded in selecting the low bidder. Local manufacturers would be ex-
pected to obtain a substantial amount of contracts (see paragraph 5.09). The
main civil works contracts will be open to bidding only by Brazilian con-
tractors of which there are enough with the necessary experience to offer
significant competition.
6.03         Under previous power loans foreign and domestic bids have been
compared by adding 15% in lieu of customs duties to the foreign bids and
converting the resulting amount to cruzeiros by using the rate of exchange
prevailing 30 days prior to bid opening. Since the last loan was negotiated,
certain Port and Marine Taxes have been created (see Annex 2 for details) and
I an "Instruction No. 6" (see Annerx 3) has been issued by the Ministry of Finance.
These developments would require that an average of about 3% of the value of
imports would be added as part of the landed cost before comparing with local
bids and that the rate of exchange used would be that prevailing on the date
of award. These taxes apply to imports, exports, and coastwise shipping and
the Bank and the Borrower have agreed they may be considered user charges and
included in the cost of imports for the purpose of comparing local and foreign
bids; the full proceeds of these taxes are assigned to port and merchant marine
improvements. However, loan funds would not be available for payment of the
taxes.



- 16 -
6.oh        No disbursements would be made for expenditures incurred prior
to the signing of the loan, except for relevant engineering services which
would be about US$300,000. Disbursements under the proposed loan would
cover the CIF cost of equipment from foreign origin after allowing for
joint financing arrangements or local cost of equipment acquired from
local suppliers as a result of international competitive bidding. For
engineering services and training costs disbursements would be for the
actual foreign exchange cost. Any unutilized amounts would be cancelled.



- 17 -
VII.  JUSTIFICATION OF THE PROJECT
7.01      The market for electricity in south-central Brazil expanded on an
average annual rate of 11.2% through the 1950's, then dropped to an average
of 8.1% from 1960 through 1968 because growth from 1964 to 1967 was small
due to the Government's action to correct economic maladjustments which
occurred prior to that period. However, in 1968 the rate was 12.3% and
was estimated late in 1969 to be over 13% for that year. Eletrobras' re-
cent studies (see paragraph 2.05) have resulted in a projected annual ex-
pansion rate of about 10.5% through the 1970's.
7.02      To provide a test for the timing of Marimbondo and Furnas units
7 and 8 it was deemed prudent to request Furnas to make a market projection
based on the estimated regional market of 1969 projected to 1980 at an annual
rate of expansion of 9%. From this projection it may be concluded that if all
projects under construction in the region are completed on schedule, including
the proposed Marimbondo plant and Furnas units 7 and 8, there may be a short-
age of energy of about 8% in 1975 when Marimbondo starts to operate and capaci-
ty requirements including reserves will barely be met. It is expected that
this energy shortage could be overcome by temporarily overdrawing on storage
in the Furnas reservoir -- a procedure resorted to in 1969 when a dry spell in
Sao Paulo required Furnas to exceed its contract commitments to Light. It is
also clear that through 1980 Furnas cannot expect help from projects under
construction by others.
7.03      Furnas has contracts to supply power to some entities on a fixed
supply basis, but is also responsible for supplying other areas, notably
that centering on Rio de Janeiro, in accordance with the growing market demand,
which has been estimated on the basis of the above-mentioned 9% regional ex-
pansion but adjusted within the Furnas area of primary responsibility in accord-
ance with its special requirements (see Annex 1). The contract demands are
depicted graphically (see Annex 4), together with the indication of the sche-
duled completion of Furnas' generating facilities under construction and in-
cluding Marimbondo and Furnas units 7 and 8. The following conclusions may
be drawn:
i)  There will be a small shortage of energy
in 1974 and 1975 (this could be overcome
by special operation of Furnas reservoir).
ii)  Furnas units 7 and 8 are needed in 1973
and 1974 to avoid a substantial re-
duction in reserve capacity.
iii)  Marimbondo plant must be in operation in
early 1975 to avoid shortages of reserve
capacity.



- 18 -
iv) Marimbondo plant will be fully loaded two
years after its completion if a planned
nuclear plant is in commercial operation
by 1977. Since the nuclear plant is
quite likely to be at least a year late
(paragraph 4.01), the Marimbondo plant
is more likely to be fully loaded in
about a year. This indicates the total
installation is not excessive and justifies
the installation of all eight units in one
continuous operation.
v) An additional plant will be required in
1979 for both capaci5ty and energy.
Alternative Sources of Energy and Capacity
7.0h         The proposed projects represent the most economic form in which
additional generating capacity can be provided. A consultant group formed
by Companhia Auxiliar de Empresas Eletricas Brasileiras and the Montreal
Engineering Co. of Canada made a study of alternative new sources, each
one of which would equally well enable the Furnas system to deliver the
same amount of power to the market. In one approach the study shows that
the discount rate which equates the system investment plus operating costs
in the Marimbondo plant and its associated transmission facilities, com-
pared with the same items in the most appropriate combination of a thermal
plant operated with a hydro plant, is about 125  per annum.  Under another
approach the discount rate which equates the system investment and operating
costs with Marimbondo plant and its associated transmission facilities, com-
pared with those of the system with a thermal alternative, is estimated to
be 16% per annum, which is satisfactory.
7.05         As for Furnas units 7 and 8, in another study by the same con-
sultant group it was shown that the unit cost of installing additional units
with a step-up substation would be considerably lower than that of any other
alternative source of capacity.
Incremental Rate of Return
7.06         The incremental rate of return of the MariDtbondo plant and trans-
mission facilities is 20% valuing output at present basic tariffs. The cor-
responding rate of Furnas units 7 and 8 is 49%; this unusually high rate is
due to the large investments in civil works heretofore made to provide the
facilities needed by these new units. The return for units 7 and 8 taking
into consideration the complete Furnas installation, i.e., including the
applicable investment heretofore made, is 24%. Annex 5 describes in detail
how the incremental rates of return were determined.



- 19 -
7.07      In addition to the above rates of return, benefits difficult to
quantify accrue to the economy as a whole. In the case of Marimbondo trans-
mission lines, other generating units of the system will be able to make
some use of them both before and after the Marimbondo plant is completed.
As for Furnas units 7 and 8, their installation permits a greater use of
the Furnas reservoir storage and an increase in the capacity and energy pro-
duction from plants downstream. Moreover, in addition to the power rates
charged by the utilities, certain taxes and other charges are levied on
ultimate consumers for further investment in the power sector which charges
are not included in the revenues of Furnas or its customers. Thus these
additional benefits, which have not been included in the above calculations,
would make the full economic returns higher.

VIII. TARIFFS
8.01      In recent years, particularly in 1964, many changes have occurred
in Brazilian legislation relating to tariffs for the power sector. Such
changes were brought about because of inflation in Brazil and the previous
inability of electric utilities to obtain a reasonable rate of return.
Thus, with regulation on the basis of historical cost and with substantial
inflation taking place, it was impossible to generate a reasonable portion
of funds for normal expansion of facilities and, as a result, the level of
service deteriorated. A description of tariff regulations and of related
taxes and compulsory loans paid by consumers is included in Annex 6. Under
the present legislation and the administration thereof the system is working
well.  Regulation enables electric utilities to achieve a reasonable rate of
return and generate funds used for annstruction purposes. Funds also are
raised from consumers through additional charges on electric bills for taxes
and compulsory loans, from reinvestment of earnings by ELetrobras in securi-
ties of electric utilities in order to finance expansion, from Government and
through substantial foreign loans. It has thus been possible in the south-
central region to raise the quality of service and meet the increasing demand
for power.
8.02      Annual revaluation of assets (see Annex 6, paragraph 4) to reflect
the effects of inflation is now mandatory, but related applications for tariff
increases based on such revaluations are not mandatory. Protection is afford-
ed by three provisions in existing and in the proposed Loan and Guarantee
Agreements, as follows:
(a) Furnas shall make application for tariff
adjustments, based on annual revaluations,
within five months after the end of every
calendar year so that its tariffs will be
sufficient to ensure operations in accord-
ance with sound financial and public
utility practice.
(b) The Government of Brazil shall require
agencies with jurisdiction over Furnas'
rates to act on tariff applications
within a period of not more than 30
days after their receipt.
(c) The Bank may suspend or cancel in case
the applicable legislation is changed
materially and adversely affects the
Borrower's business.



- 21 -
8.03      The history of changes in the tariffs of Furnas has been satis-
factory. Between January 1965 and May 1969 16 applications were filed, all
of which with one exception became effective substantially as requested.
In the latter case the amount of increase in tariffs was reduced because
the Department of Water and Power of the Ministry of Mines and Energy,
which regulates electric utilities, with the agreement of Furnas concluded
that annual depreciation charges for hydroelectric systems should be limited
to 3%, in lieu of the previous maximum of 5%. Seven applications providing
for changes in basic tariffs were filed (usually in the month of April) and
were on the average effective within a month after filing. The other nine
filings were in the form of surcharges to reflect either changes in foreign
exchange rates and related increases in the cost of servicing foreign debt
or in cost of fuel incidental to thermal generation. These nine surcharges
went into effect automatically without advance approval of the Department.

IX. FINANCIAL ASPECTS
9.01      The past, present and prospective financial position and financial
results of Furnas have been and are expected to be satisfactory (Annexes 7,
8 and 10). Good management (paragraph 3.04) and tariff regulation (para-
graph 8.01) are the principal reasons for this situation.
Past Operations
9.02      During the years 1966 through 1968 demand on Furnas increased
substantially from less than 600 Mw in 1966 to 795 Mw in 1967 and 1,261 Mw
in 1968. Power sales increased 38% in 1966, 18% in 1967, and 31% in 1968
when they totaled 5,719 million kwh Q(knnex 7). Reflecting inflation and
the related adjustments in tariffs previously mentioned, the average real-
ization per kwh increased from NCr$0.'02217 in 1966 to NCr$0.03602 in 1968.
In terms of U.S. dollars there was practically no change in the price,equiv-
alent to about one cent per kwh.
9.03      From the beginning of 1966 to the end of 1968, fixed assets in
operation increased substantially from NCr$330 million to NCr$874 million
and work in progress from NCr$36 million to NCr$567 million. Of the total
combined increase of NCr$1,075 million, NCr$660 million (61%) represented
new construction or acquisitions and NCr$415 million (39%) represented re-
valuation of fixed assets.
9.04      Earnings of Furnas have been satisfactory in recent years.  Tariff
regulation permits a 10% rate of return on revalued assets as discussed in
detail in Annex 6. To the extent that realized earnings are less than this
10% return on remunerable investment (rate base) the shortfall (deficiency
in earnings) may be subsequently recovered and is one of the elements in
setting basic tariffs. Earnings of Furnas in recent years have been suffi-
cient to reduce the amount of accumulated shortfall. Budgeted results
anticipate a substantial reduction if not elimination by the end of 1970 of
the NCr$38 million of shortfall at the end of 1968.
9.05      Return calculated on the basis of remunerable investment as defined
for purposes of Brazilian regulation, (Annex 6) in the years 1966-1968 has
averaged close to 11%. Return calculated in accordance with a test devised
by the Bank under Loan 403/474-BR (developed only for the purpose of measuring
whether any possible future changes in legislation would materially and ad-
versely affect the position of Furnas), was over 1h% in the years 1966, 1967
and 1968. The Bank's test was calculated as the percentage of operating in-
come (excluding income taxes and amortization from costs of operation) and
after depreciation at a 21A rate to the average of the revalued net fixed
assets in operation at the beginning and end of the year. Under Brazilian re-
gulation, however, operating income is calculated after inclusion of income
taxes, depreciation (presently at a 3% rate) and amortization charges as costs
of operation. Amortization charges have substantially the same effect as
depreciation charges.



- 23 -
9.06      Coverage of total interest by operating income before income taxes
in the years 1966-1968 varied between 1.6 and 3.4 times. Coverage of 1.6 times
in 1968 reflects a higher proportion of work in progress in total fixed assets.
Work in progress is not part of remunerable investment and thus makes no contri-
bution to operating income. As presented in Annex 7, interest charged to cons-
truction (taxable income under Brazilian law) is applied as a reduction of
total interest.
Present Financial Position
9.07      Furnas' financial statements have been prepared immediately after the
close of the fiscal year and have been promptly audited by Arthur Andersen and
Company. These arrangements have been satisfactory. In order to assure that
adequate and prompt auditing continues in the future, a covenant similar to
that in existing loans requiring Furnas to employ auditors acceptable to the
Bank is included in the proposed Loan Agreement.
9.08      The financial position of Furnas as of December 31, 1968, is shown
in Annex 8. The summary balance sheets, presented below, show the actual
audited data and the effect of revaluing Furnas' accounts on the bases of
(a) the coefficient issued annually by the Government and used to revalue
assets and local long-term debt to reflect inflation, and (b) the foreign
exchange rate applicable at December 31, 1968.

9.09       In January 1969 the coefficient issued by the Government for re-
valuation purposes reflected an inflation in 1968 of 25% and Furnas accord-
ingly revalued its assets and local long-term debt in April 1969. At the
same time Furnas revalued its foreign loans on the basis of the exchange
rate of NCr$3.83 to US$1 as of December 31, 1968. These steps were a
necessary part of the tariff increase process. At the end of 1968, fixed
assets in operation reflecting this revaluation approximated NCr$l,ll5
million and work in progress NCr$676 million. As indicated in paragraph
3.06, substantial generation facilities are under construction.
9.10       Furnas' balance sheet at the end of any year usually reflects .3
weak current financial position. Actual balance sheets for the years
ending in 1966 through 1968 (Annex 8) indicate current liabilities substan-
tially in excess of current assets. As long as inflation continues it is
desirable to operate with minimum reasonable cash balances. The working
capital position at December 31 generaIly reflects the worst current
position for any 12-month period. Ma9y of the current liabilities are not
due for payment until 6 to 12 months later. Furnas has always been able to
meet its current obligations.
9.11       A detailed schedule of individual long-term debts is shown in
Annex 9. Long-term debt at December 31, 1968, was about 56% of the total
fixed assets. This is within the 66-2/3% debt limitation provided in
existing Loan Agreements. A similar debt limitation covenant is included
in the proposed Loan Agreement.
Proposed Financing Plan
9.12       The financing plans of Furnas are based on the expectation that
most local funds will be obtained through internal cash generation and the
purchase of share capital and loans by Eletrobras and that foreign expend-
itures will be financed by lending institutions such as the Bank and AID
and by foreign suppliers including joint financing loans. The Bank will
also finance some local expenditures subject to international competitive
bidding.  These plans are satisfactory.  As indicated in paragraph 4.01
future projects are presently estimated to require large expenditures.
These, however, are subject to further study and provision is included in
the proposed Loan Agreement that no major projects will be undertaken ex-
cept in accordance with a financing plan satisfactory to the Bank.
9.13      A forecast of the source and application of funds for the 10-year
period 1969 through 1978, is shown in Annex 10. The plan for financing this
expansion program over the period is summarized in the table which follows.
For the years 1969 and 1970, the data in Annex 10 as well as in the projected
income statements and balance sheets represent budget estimates used by Furnas
in tariff proceedings. For subsequent years the 10% return on future year-end
remunerable investment permitted by regulation has been projected. This
approach is appropriate in the light of the frequent changes in tariffs of
Furnas, the experience of Furnas, and the requirement of Bank Loan and Guarantee
Agreements (paragraph 8.02). Tariffs are adjusted to provide the permitted
level of earnings. As seen in the table below, total funds required for the



- 25 -
10-year period are estimated at NCr$5,742 million. Under the projected ex-
pansion program, estimated construction expenditures excluding interest charged
to construction amount to about NCr$4,785 million, or about 83% of the total
application of funds, excluding debt service. The balance of the required funds
consists of about NCr$739 million for interest charged to construction and about
NCr$219 million for working capital. The proposed Marimbondo project is esti-
mated to cost more than NCr$1,000 million, or over 20% of the construction ex-
penditures during this 10-year period. A detailed schedule showing the esti-
mated costs of the various projects included in the expansion program is in
Annex 11.

9.14        The net internal cash generation as shown in the table above,
amounting to 26% of the total source of funds, is before consideration of
additional share capital expected to be sold. The forecasts are based on
the expectation that Eletrobras will in the future continue to receive divi-
dends of 12% per annum from Furnas and reinvest these dividends (less a tax
of 15% thereon) in additional shares of Furnas, as it has substantially done
in the past. With reinvestment of dividends by Eletrobras, internal cash
generation approximates 41% of required funds with some modest increase if
minority stockholders holding about 5% of the capital stock also reinvest
dividends received.
9.15        Of the total foreign borrowing of NCr$2,173 million projected
through the year 1978, 26% will be provided from existing Loan Agreements
(principally with the Bank and AID), 19% is estimated to be provided by the
proposed Bank and joint financing loans, and the balance of 55% will have
to be arranged as future projects become ready for financing.
9.16        For the purpose of this report it has been assumed that the in-
terest rate of the proposed Bank loan and the joint loans for the Marimbondo
project would be 7%. Amortization of the proposed Bank loan would be adjusted
to repayment of the joint loans without reducing any repayments to the Bank
below US$100,000 equivalent.  The proposed Bank loan would have a 7-year grace
period and a 22r-year amortization period.  The joint loans would be amortized
over a 10-year period from dates of delivery with the latter defined as the
date of completed installation at the site, as determined by the Bank, but not
to exceed 18 months from the date of shipment. Interest rates on borrowings
from Eletrobras are between 8uA and 13%. The Eletrobras loan for the Marim-
bondo project has been included in the financial projections as a 22-year
loan, including a 7-year grace period, with a 13% interest rate. This debt
will, as does all local long-term debt (paragraph 9.09 and Annex 6), include
provision for monetary restatement to reflect changes in price levels. De-
tailed schedules of the annual interest and amortization payments for all
loans have been included in Annex 12 (Interest Schedule) and Annex 13
(Amortization Schedule).
9.17        The proposed financial plan is reasonable.  Assurances are pro-
vided in the proposed Guarantee Agreement that in the event of a shortage of
funds the Government would provide Furnas with the necessary funds to carry
out the Bank project.
Estimated Future Operations
9.18        Forecasts of earnings (Annex 7) are based primarily on the ex-
pectation that Furnas will, in the future, as it has in recent years, be
able to earn the return of 10% on remunerable investment provided for in
tariff regulation in Brazil and described in detail in Annex 6. A total re-
turn exceeding 10% is contemplated for the years 1969-1970 in the expectation
that there will be a reduction in the accumulated shortfall in past earnings
(paragraph 9.04).  Foreign exchange expenditures have been cast in terms of
the official foreign exchange rate as of December 31, 1968, of NCr$3.83 to
US$1. Normal increases in operating costs reflecting the growth of Furnas
have been considered but no provision has been made for subsequent changes



- 27 -
in foreign exchange rates, which change frequently in small amounts, or in
price levels. These are provided for under the tariff arrangements.
9.19      In 1969 and future years, Furnas intends to charge and include in
cost of operations 3% for depreciation and 3% for amortization. These per-
mitted liberal rates are being used to enhance internal cash generation and
assist in financing the construction program. Of total internal cash gener-
ation of NCr$5,214 million over the 10 years 1969-1978, depreciation and amor-
tization total NCr$2,343 million or 5%.
9.20      The estimated kwh sales are based on sales contracts with customers
as described in paragraph 3.05 and shown in Annex 1. In 1969 estimated sales
increased very substantially, reflecting the assistance rendered in meeting
power requirements in Sao Paulo, which was adversely affected by drought
(paragraph 7.02). As a result of these unusually high sales in relation to
relatively normal increases in kw demand, estimated price per kwh realized
in 1969 was only moderately higher than in 1968 despite customary tariff
increases.
9.21      As indicated in the forecast source and application of funds state-
ments (Annex 10), debt service is covered by internal cash generation about
1.6 times during the 10 years 1969-1978, a satisfactory ratio. Projected in-
terest coverage appears low but combined depreciation and amortization charges
equal about 6% of plant in service. Excluding the amortization charge and
recording a normal depreciation charge of 2rS as used in the Bank's test (para-
graph 9.05), the lowest projected interest coverage of 1.1 times would be
increased to 1.6 times. It must be recognized that substantial amounts of
interest relate to plant in process of construction which makes no contribu-
tion to operating income until placed in service. The percentage of total
long-term debt to total fixed assets is expected to reach its highest level of
61.9% by the end of 1974 but for the most part is around 60%. The contractual
nature of Furnas' operations (paragraph 3.05) imparts stability to its position.

X. RECOMMENDATIONS
10.01       During loan negotiations, agreement was reached on the
following principal points:
a.  Covenants substantially in accord with those
in existing Loan or Guarantee Agreements with
the Borrower are included in the proposed
agreements (paragraphs 4b01, 5.15, 8.02, 9.07,
9.11 and 9.17);
b.  the Borrower will make its best efforts to
obtain joint loans; and upon the prematuring
of a joint loan because of a default the Bank
may declare a default under the Bank loan
(paragraph 5.10);
c.  for bid comparison purposes the CIF landed
cost of imported goods may include certain
recently adopted maritime taxes (paragraph
6.03).
10.02       The project forms a suitable basis for a Bank loan of US$80.0
million equivalent (excluding interest during construction) for 30 years
including a grace period of 7 years.

PORT AND i ARIT1i3 TAXES
Port Improvement Tax
This tax was created per Decree No. 8.311 of December 6
1945, and Decree No. 3.421 of July 10, 1958, and was subsequently
amended by Decree No. 415 of January 10, 1969.  It was created to
form a part of the "Fundo Portuario Nacional" in order to provide
financial resources for the improvement of ports and access channels.
Charges apply to exports and coastal shipping as well as to imports.
They are calculated on the basis of the commercial value of the
merchandise, which is interpreted to mean the CIF value as follows:
a)  2/' when the merchandise is imported;
b) 0.2% when the merchandise is exported; and
c) 0.2% when the merchandise is shipped to or from
another port in Brazil.
Tax for Renovation of Merchant Marine
This tax was established by Decree No. 3.381 of April 24,
1958 and was subsequently amended by Decree No. 432 of January 23,
1969. It was created to form a part of the "Fundo da Marinha Mercante"'
in order to provide financial resources for the merchant marine of
Brazil.  Charges apply to both domestic and foreign shipping as follows:
a) 20% of the freight value for departure from a national
port in the commerce of Brazilian coastal shipping; and
b) 15% of the freight value for imports from the overseas.

MINISTRY OF FINANCE
ORDER (PORTARIA) OF JANUARY 14, 1969
In exercise of the powers conferred on him by law, the Minister of
Finance hereby resolves as follows:
No. 6 - I. For the purpose of implementation of the present order, the
term "international bidding" shall be understood to cover any call for bids
issued by a public authority or a private entity for the supply of machinery,
industrial equipment, and materials for processing, when not restricted to
domestic manufactures.
II. The definition given in Section I shall also include price
quotations from a restricted number of bidders with a view to the purchase
of goods.
III. Invitations to participate in international bidding shall comply
with all the following regulations:
(a)   They shall contain a clause setting forth or accepting
a formula for price adjustment so that the value of
domestic currency can be restored in the event of an
increase in domestic costs;
(b)   requirements for bonds and guarantees on the part of
the bidders should not be in excess of those normally
and usually laid down in the countries concerned,
including Brazil;
(c)   any penalties for failure to observe the technical or
performance guarantees shall be no more severe than
those that are traditionally accepted on the inter-
national market, and shall be limited to an amount
proportional to the value of the supply contract;
(d) the terms of pryment shall admit bids in accordance with
the usual supply practices of the domestic manufacturers
of machinery and industrial equipment and consistent with
the schedule of manufacturing expenses.
IV. The comparison of bids made in international competitions, when
financing over more than 15 years is entailed, pursuant to Article 18 of
Decree Law No. 37 of November 18, 1966, shall be based on the system set
forth in points 1 and 2 below:
(1) Foreign bids shall observe the following rules:
(a) They shall state the CIF price, listing separately
the estimated portion of that price that is repre-
sented by freight and insurance and handling (estiva)
at the port of destination;



ANNEX 3
Page 2 of 4
(b)  the CIF price shall be converted into new
cruzeiros at the rate of exchange of the Banco
do Brasil S.A. in force on the day on which the
bids are opened; in the event of a change in the
rate between that day and the date of the official
award, the price quoted in the foreign bids shall
be recalculated on the basis of the new rate of
exchange;
(c) the prices in new cruzeiros, determined as set
forth in (b) above, shall be augmented by the
following unloading charges, even though the
importer may be exempt therefrom:
(i) Merchant fleet renewal tax;
(ii) Port improvement tax;
(d) if, on the day the bids are opened, any foreign exchange
charges are due on the imports, the amount thereof
shall be added to the price in new cruzeiros, determined
as set forth in (b) above;
(e) once the total price in new cruzeiros has been determined
as provided for above, it shall be augmented by a minimum
of 15% pursuant to point III of the Sole Proviso of
Article 17 of Decree Law No. 37-66, regulated by Decree
No. 61,574 of October 20, 1967; this 15% coefficient shall
be applied on the basis of the following formula:
PO = (1 plus t) (P plus D)
PO = Final price for purposes of comparison
P  -CIF price quoted as defined in (b)
D    Unloading charges, as defined in (c)
t  =Rate for protection margin;
(f) the final comparative price for foreign bids shall be
obtained by adding the price in new cruzeiros of any
parts of domestic origin to the price determined as
provided for above.
(2)   Domestic bids shall observe the following rules:
(a) Domestic bids shall be understood to be those with
a component of locally manufactured parts represent-
ing 50% or more of the value of the complete equip-
ment, which percentage shall be determined using the
dollar rate in force on the day on which the bids
are opened;
(b) the provisions of (a) above shall not include equipment
for which the domestic content has been specified in
accordance with a Government-approved scheme;



ANNEX 3
Page 3 of h
(c) for the purposes of comparison, the FOB factory
price in new cruzeiros of the domestic bid shall
be used;
(d) for the purpose of price comparison, in the event of a
change in the rate of exchange, only that porticn
of the adjustment shall be taken account of that
relates to the period between the start of bidding
and the official award, even though the domestic bid
may include a price adjustment in accordance with a
formula contained in the bidding conditions; in such
event and in order to reestablish parity with the
foreign bid, the price quoted in the domestic bid
shall be augmented by the portion of the adjustment
based on notional application of the respective
formula.
V. The comparison of bids made in international competitions, entail-
ing external financing over less than 15 years or no external financing at all,
shall be based on the system set forth in points 1 and 2 below:
(1)    Foreign bids shall observe the followiing rules:
(a) They shall state the CIF price, listing separately
and clearly the portion of that price represented
by freight and insurance and explicitly including the
cost of handling at the port of destination;
(b) the CIF price shall be converted into new cruzeiros at
the rate of exchange of the Banco do Brasil S.A. in
force on the day on which the bids are opened; in the
event of a change in the rate between that day and the
date of the official award, the prices quoted in the
foreign bids shall be recalculated on the basis of the

BRAZIL
CENTRAL ELETRICA DE FURNAS S.A.
14kRIMBONDD PROJECT
Incremental Rate of Return
1.        The incremental rate of return of the Marimbondo project was
determined as set out below, and is the discount rate at which the present
worth of the cost of the project equals the present worth of the revenues
produced by it over its life:
(a) The life of the project is 40 years.
(b) The annual capital costs comprise
construction costs and investments in
working capital. The project's annual
construction cost is shown in Annex 11.
Investments in working capital are pro-
jected as the units go into operation:
for the Marimbondo plant, the estimated
amount is NCr$27 million, and for Furnas
units 7 and 8 it is NCr$0.7 million.
(c) The annual net revenue is the annual gross
revenue less incremental operating costs.
The annual gross revenue is equal to the
annual capacity sales attributed to the
project multiplied by the demand charge
plus the annual energy sales attributed
to the project multiplied by the energy
charge.
(d) The annual sales of capacity were deter-
mined by allocating the incremental Mw
sales first to the Marimbondo plant up to
its capacity, and thereafter the rest of
the incremental sales to Furnas units 7
and 8. The average annual sales of energy
were determined by apportioning the total
sales of the Corporation to the respective
plants in accordance with the estimated
operating conditions, and were estimated
at 7.43 billion kwh for Marimbondo once
fully in operation. No increase in ener-
gy was attributed to Furnas units 7 and 8
since they serve only for peaking capacity.



ANNEX 5
Page 2 of 2
(e) The demand cherge in the calculations
of revenues was NCr$*1.54 per kw per
month, and the energy charge was
NCr$9.82 per Aiwh. These figures
correspond to the revised basic tariff
for the period 1969/70 put in effect
in May 1969. These tariffs include
income taxes of Furnas as part of the
costs of operation.
2.        On the basis of the above, it was determined that the present
worth of capital costs would equal the present worth of the benefits over
a 40-year period at a discount rate of 20.2% for Marimbondo plant and trans-
mission, and 49.4% for Furnas units 7 and 8. If the total cost of the Furnas
plant were averaged out over the eight units, then the rate of return on the
last units would be 23.9%.

ANNEX 6
Page 1 of 3
BRAZIL
CENTRAL  ELETRICA DE FURNAS S.A.
Tariffs
1.        Regulations governing tariffs are contained in the Water Code of
1934, subsequent amendments and decrees including decrees dated February 26,
1957 and November 4, 1964 and Law 5,073 enacted on August 18, 1966. Prior
to 196h, tariffs were based on the use of the historic value of investment,
thereby not reflecting the substantial inflation that occurred in Brazil.
The 1964 decree allows utilities to revalue their investment to reflect
changes in price levels. The 1966 legislation made yearly revaluations
of assets mandatory.
2.        Under the existing regulations, tariffs are reviewed and approved
by the Department of Water and Power of the Ministry of Mines and thergy
every three years or at shorter intervals at the initiative of the Waters
Department or the utility. In recent years, tariff applications of Furnas
have been for two year intervals comprised of a basic application including
financial forecasts for two years followed by appropriate subsequent adjust-
ments for price level changes in the second year. Utilities are permitted
to apply for tariffs which would yield revenues covering (a) operating costs
including income taxes; (b) straight line depreciation of gross fixed assets
in operation, excluding land and land rights, at annual rates of up to 5%
for thermal plants and up to 3% for all other facilities including hydro
plants but with no effective minima in either case; (c) amortization pro-
vision of up to 5% or a reversion provision of up to 3% of the total gross
fixed assets in operation; and (d) a return of 10% on the remunerable invest-
ment. Furnas provides for amortization, not reversion which mechanically
requires a deposit of cash with the Government which is withdrawn to pay for
property acquired. Remunerable investment in effect is defined as the book
value of the estimated end of year gross plant in service (excluding assets
acquired through contributions in aid of construction) less depreciation
and reversion or amortization reserves, plus reversion or amortization funds
and an end-of-year allowance for working capital consisting of materials and
supplies, receivables equivalent to two months' billings, and cash up to the
value of the reserve for depreciation balance. In principle, shortfalls in
achieving the return of 10% in the three-year tariff period may be recovered
in the subsequent three-year period. However, another provision in the re-
gulations permits tariff adjustments for recovering shortfalls at more fre-
quent intervals. In the case of Furnas the period has been two years.



ANNFX 6
Page 2 of 3
3.        Without advance approval of the Waters Department surcharges
between tariff revisions may be added by utilities to current tariffs to
cover compulsory increases in wages, social benefits, cost of fuel and pur-
chased power, and increases in foreign debt service due to changes in the
foreign exchange rate. Tariff adjustments of May 1969 of Furnas reflecting
monetary corrections also permitted the elimination of surcharges.
4.        Tariff adjustments on account of revaluation of balance sheet
accounts can be made as often as economic correction factors (coefficients)
showing the variations in the price level are calculated and published by
the Government. The coefficients are issued annually about one month after
the end of each year for the use of industry in general as well as electric
utilities. The coefficients are applied by utilities to update the values
of plant in service, depreciation and amortization or reversion reserves,
and certain local currency loans of Rletrobras and of the National Develop-
ment Bank.  Increased tariffs resulting from revaluation of assets based on
coefficients do not, however, completely offset the effects of inflation.
In any given year construction expenditures incurred in the immediate prior
year are not revalued. Furthermore, the effects of inflation in the current
year are not recognized because utility plant is revalued as of the beginning
of that year. In addition, no price level adjustment is made for shortfalls
in earnings which are to be recovered in succeeding years. Foreign currency
components of the book value of fixed assets are converted into local currency
at the rate of exchange in effect at the time the assets are acquired except
for assets constructed with the proceeds of foreign loans. In such cases the
rate of exchange initially used is that in effect at the date of the signing
of the loan contract. With the first repayment of principal of such loan, an
adjustment is made to reflect the exchange rate in effect at the time of re-
payment. At the same time as the application of the coefficient, but in lieu
of the use of the coefficient, Furnas, as is permitted, adjusts its assets
constructed with foreign currency to changes in exchange rates as applied to
its foreign debts. As offsets to the fact that remunerable investment does
not fully reflect inflation, it must be recognized that cost of service for
a given year is related to remunerable investment as of the end of that year
and that both cost of service (which includes taxes on income) and remunerable
investment are based on estimated projections. Furnas in its tariff appli-
cations makes adjustments to reflect the fact that tariffs for a given period
generally do not go into effect until some four or five months after the close
of the calendar year. Furthermore, as indicated in paragraph 2 above, com-
bined allowances permitted for depreciation and amortization are liberal.
5.        In addition to a basic tariff and surcharges, consumers pay three
other charges. The Federal Government levies two charges to raise additional
resources for the financing of power development, a tax called the Imposto
Unico (sole tax), which varies among consumer classes, and the Rmprestimo
Compulsorio (compulsory loan). These two charges do not apply to sales to
other utilities for resale which is Furnas' source of operating revenues.



ANNEX 6
Page 3 of 3
The sole tax rate is 47% for residential customers, 22% for commercial
customers and 2% for industrial customers. The compulsory loan rate is 35%
for commercial and industrial customers. The percentage for industrial cus-
tomers is reduced for companies with energy costs amounting to 3% or more of
sales and also for certain industries in the national interest. The above
percentages are applied not to the price per kwh actually paid by the cus-
tomer but to an average price per kwh realized by major Brazilian electric
utility systems. The proceeds of the sole tax, which was first imposed in
1954, are distributed, after retention of 5% by the Ministry of Finance, as
follows: 37% to Eletrobras which administers the Federal Electrification
Fund; 50% to the states; 10% to the municipalities; 1% to the Ministry of
Mines and Energy and 2% to its Water Department. The compulsory loan,
introduced in 1962 and scheduled to be discontinued at the end of 1973,
is administered by Eletrobras and invested in power projects as share
capital or as loans with an effective interest rate of about 13%. Eletrobras
has consistently reinvested dividends received, less taxes thereon, from Fur-
ras.  Customers receive debt certificates   for the amount of the compulsory
loan paid; the certificates are revalued annually, pay 6% interest, and are
repayable in 20 years. Finally, the total rate for power includes a social
security tax amounting to 3% of the actual charge for service, excluding the
sole tax and compulsory loan, billed to the customer.
