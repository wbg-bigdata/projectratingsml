4EMORANDUK AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT
OF THE INTERNATIONAL BANK FOR RECONSTRUCTION AND DEVELOPMENT
TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS
ON A PROPOSED LOAN
TO THE PEOPLE'S REPUBLIC OF THE CONGO
FOR A NATIONAL A'IRICULTURAL EXTENSION
AND ADAPTIVE RESEARCH PROJECT
1.        The following memorandum and recommendation on a proposed loan to
the People's Republic of the Congo for US$15.8 million equivalent is
submitted for approval. The proposed loan would be on standard IBRD terms
with 20 years maturity and would assist the Government of the People's
Republic of the Congo in financing a national agricultural extension and
adaptive research project.
2.        Background.    The Congo  is endowed with  a large potentially
cultivable area (about one fourth of its total land area of 342,000 km2), but
only three oercent of this area is actually cultivated.   It has also
considerable forest resources (60 percent of the national territory is
covered with tropical forests). However, since Independence, agriculture has
performed below its potential and remains stagnant. As a result, agriculture
which provided 60 percent of the jobs nationally during the 1960s, currently
only employs one third of the labor force. The share of the agricultural
sector (including forestry), estimated at 16 percent of GDP in the early
1970s, had declined steadily to 8 percent in 1987.   This decline, also
explained by the relative rise of oil, is accounted by falling terms of trade
for the rural sector vis-a-vis urban areas, greater competition from the
Congo's immediate neighbor (Zaire) and cheap food imports, and increasing
migration to urban centers. The poor performance of the agricultural sector
and its decline relative to other sectors have been the result of the typical
impact of an oil-based economy that led to policies discouraging agricultural
production and reducing rural incomes.
3.        Severe constraints affect the Congolese agriculture. Fragile soils
with a low level of fertility, and aggressive rains causing heavy losses
through erosion and nutrient leaching, make it difficult for farmers to
intensify  their  cropping  activities  without  the  introduction  of  new
cultivation methods. Consequently, shifting cultivation systems are still
dominant, resulting in increased areas of degraded herbaceous savanna and
encroachment on the rain forest.   The lack of feeder roads is still a
formidable impediment to the marketing of agricultural produce and therefore
acts as a disincentive to eliciting an effective supply response. Finally,
the economically active rural population, consisting mainly of about 145,000
smallholders, is falling in number and aging. Furthermore, its composition
has drastically changed with women now representing the backbone of the rural
economy.
4.        Since Independence in 1960, the People's Republic of the Congo has
relied heavily on the public sector to generate employment. This tendency
has accentuated since the mid-1970s due to the rising importance of oil
revenues in the Government budget. The softening of oil prices in 1984-85
brought liquidity problems and led the Government to launch an ambitious



- 2 -
economic reform program to reverse the deteriorating trend of the e-onomy.
In early 1986, the Government turned to the IMF for support, and a stand-by
agreement was  finalized in July 1986.   Thereafter,  French authorities
approved a fast-disbursing loan of US$35 million equivalent which was
followed by the First Bank Structural Adjustment Loan (Loan No. 2866-COB) of
US$70 million in July 1987.   The Bank loan, disbursed over 1988-89, has
supported the Congo's economic stabilization measures already in place and
its efforts to initiate a mediu;.-term adjustment program.  This program aims
at restoring balance between the public and private sectors, to overcome
severe fiscal and economic imbalances and to foster growth in the non-oil
sectors.  The continuation of this program would be supported by a Second
Structural Adjustment Loan (FY9lL).
5.        Consistent with the Structural Adjustment Program, the Government
has taken a series of policy measures aimed at eliciting a supply response
in the smallholder agriculture sector. These measures include liberalization
of agricultural trade, in particular the suppression of parastatal marketing
monopolies. Private traders are now allowed to operate in competition with
government agencies,  and to freely negotiate prices with farmers.   In
parallel, the Government has started to disengage itself from the State farms
and ranches.   These measures are being reaffirmed in the context of the
Government's Medium-Term Economic and Social Action Plan (Plan d'Action
Economique et Social - PAES, 1990-94).   To accompany these reforms, the
Government has requested the Bank's assistance in formulating and financing
investments to improve smallholder support services and, as a priority,
agricultural extension and adaptive research.
6.        Project Objectives and Description.  The primary objective of the
project is to support the Government's efforts to increase production
efficiency and the income of small farmers, by facilitating the development
and dissemination of relevant agricultural  technology.   This would be
achieved through the establishment and subsequent strengthening of an
appropriate national system of agricultural extension and adaptive research
(E & R). Other objectives are: (a) to promote coordination at field level
of all technical services that interface with the farmer, with a view to
addressing in an integrated fashion all relevant aspects of smallholder
farming operations; (b) to ensure close liaison between extension, research
and other technical services, so that E&R activities can build fully on all
existing technical support; (c) to establish an E&R system responsive to
farmers' needs, predominantly those of the two target groups of the women and
the younig that play a critical role in agricultural production; and (d) to
strengthen planning capabilities in the agricultural sector, so that project
operations and those of other agricultural projects are consistent with
policies and actions set forth under the Government's strategy.
7.        The project would build upon the positive results obtained under
a pilot operation financed by UNDP seed money and two Bank PPF advances since
beginning 1987. To achieve its objectives, the project would implement over
a five-year period:   (a) core components: extension, adaptive research,
training  and  rural  promotion;  (b)  support  actions:    monitoring  and
evaluation, management assistance, and extension support for small ruminant
husbandry and inland fish farming; and (c) an agricultural planning
component. The project would be the first phase of a longer term development



program that would aim at covering the entire national territory. Project
activities would take place in 31' districts out of 47, The districts chosen
are priority zones that have sufficient agricultural potential and
accessibility to justify the creation of intensive agricultural services.
8.        The project would be implemented through existing agricultural
institutions. Overall responsibility for project management would rest with
the Directorate of Development Research, Training and Extension (DRDFV) of
the Ministry of Youth and Rural Development (MJDR). MJDR's Directorate for
Studies and Planning (DEP) would be responsible for the agricultural planning
component. Three resident technical assistants would assist the Government
for two years in the fields of extension,'adaptive research and agricultural
planning (the first two experts have already been recruited under the Pilot
Operation). Fifty nine person-months of short-term consultancies would also
be provided to assist the Government in adaptive research, training and rural
promotion, monitoring and evaluation, financial management and economic
planning.   The required local staff are available.   They would undergo
extensive retraining.
9.        The total cost of the project is estimated at US$21.7 million
equivalent, with a foreign exchange component of US$12.1 million (56
percent). Funds have been approved for two PPF advances of US$750,000 each.
A breakdown of costs and the tentative financing plan of the project are
shown in Schedule A. Amounts and methods of procurement and disbursement,
as well as the disbursement schedule are given in Schedule B. A timetable
of key project processing events and the status of the Bank Group operations
in the Congo are presented in Schedules C and D respectively. Two maps are
also attached.
10.       Rationale for Bank Involvement.   The Bank's involvement in the
project is regarded by the Government as necessary in helping develop a
national extension and adaptive research service. In the past, donors have
focused on area-based services with different extension, research, credit and
input supply systems. The donor-supported projects have proved unsustainable
by the Government when donor financing ended. By channeling donor resources
into national programs build around national institutions, the Government's
capacity to sustain the investments would be increased. The Bank has a long
experience in developing extension and research services in other countries.
The project would build upon existing institutions, available plant material
and technological improvements, and the ongoing pilot extension and research
project. It would be the catalyst for mobilizing the contribution of several
donors. By helping to foster growth in a non-oil sector, the project would
also contribute to the objective of diversification of the sources of
economic growth which underlies the Structural Adjustment program.
11.       Actions ARreed Uvon. The project objectives, design and costs were
agreed at negotiations.    The  following assurances were  obtained:  (a)
establishment of the National Coordinating Committee for Extension and
Adaptive Research; (b) deployment of line managers and subject matter
specialists; and (c) execution of a Mid-Term Evaluation by December 31, 1992.
Loan effectiveness would be conditional on: (a) signature of two cost-sharing
agreements between the Government and UNDP   for provision of resident
technical assistance for extension/adaptive research and economic planning



-4
respectively; (b) initial deposit of CFAF 100 million in the project account;
(c) establishment of the project's Steering Committee; and (d) creation of
a Rural Promotion Service at DRDFV, and appointment of its manager.
12.       Environmental Impact.  The project would have a beneficial impact
on the environment.   The adaptive research and extension component would
develop and adapt technologies geared to preserving the farmer's resource
base, such as improved soil management, anti-erosion and fertility
maintenance techniques.   Technologies  directed at stabilizing farming,
eliminating shifting cultivation and intensifying cropping systems will
reduce farmer encroachment into forest areas.   This would be the most
effective action possible in conserving Congo's tropical forest which are now
being encroached upon by shifting cultivation.
13.       Proiect  Benefits.    The  project  is expected  to  improve  the
organization and management of the national extension and adaptive research
system, and, therefore, result in significant growth in agriculturai output.
It is based on the Training and Visit (T&V) approach which has been
associated in many countries with high crop yield increases and has been
tailored under the pilot operation to the circumstances prevailing in the
Congo. It would benefit directly about 58 percent of smallholders nationwide.
it would also be an important step in the creation of an institutional
framework addressing the changing needs of the agricultural sector.
Conservative estimates, based on progress achieved thus far under the pilot
operation, give an economic rate of return for the extension component of
about 19 percent.
14.       Risks.  The main factors that could hamper satisfactory project
execution are inadequate budgetary support, lower than expected adoption
rates of improved cultivation practices, unattractive prices and lack of
marketing outlets. Concerning budgetary support, the project would provide
for about 50 percent of incremental operating costs on a declining basis over
the five-year implementation period.   Adoption rates are expected to be
significant because the project would introduce more efficient methods for
managing extension staff and providing extension advice; it wo'.d also
strengthen adaptive research so that it could provide appropriate technical
recommendations. Prices are now market determined, but could be depressed
by structural inerficiencies in marketing and poor infrastruc.ure. However,
several projects to be implemented in the near future with external
assistance would contribute to reduce this risk: (a) two operations funded
by the International Fund for Agricultural Development (IFAD) and the
European Development Fund (EDF) intend to provide support for market
development; and (b) the Bank's Road Maintenance and Rehabilitation Project
(FY9lL) presently being re-appraised, which would incorporate a rural roads
component, would contribute to address the transport constraint.
15.       Recommendation.  I am satisfied that the proposed loan would comply
with the Articles of Agreement of the Bank and recommend that the Executive
Directors approve the proposed loan.
