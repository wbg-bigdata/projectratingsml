SUMMARY
The project objective is to improve teaching and learning practices in the classroom in
order to assist the Government in improving education quality while maintaining its focus
on reaching universal primary completion by 2015. The project would do this by: (a)
improving both access and retention by expanding the number of middle school places in
the system, improving conditions in existing elementary schools, and by supporting
additional literacy courses; (b) improving education quality, with a focus on elementary
education; and (c) strengthening management at central, deconcentrated and
decentralized levels to ensure attainment of PDEF objectives.

The Project Development Objectives (PDO), project components and implementation
arrangements remain unchanged. The modifications requested at this time are related to:
(i) the extension of the closing date for the IDA credit and the PHRD grant, (ii) the
reallocation of project funds among categories and components, (iii) a refocus on
activities that aim at tackling the main internal inefficiencies and quality issues; (iv) the
revision of the results framework by reducing the number of indicators by dropping those
that are not monitored and by fine-tuning others; and (v) the involvement of Local
Development Agencies (ARDs) in the implementation of the subcomponent 1.a.


PROJECT STATUS
There continues to be good progress in achieving the development objectives. There are a
number of targets that have been met or that are on track including the following: (i)
access goals, especially with regard to the recruitment of new students into grade 1, have
been exceeded and the gross intake rate is at 117% while the target was 103%; (ii) the
gender goals have been met and exceeded, with girls constituting more than 50.6% of
the enrollments in elementary while the target was 49.3%; and surpassing the goal of 46
% set for middle schools; (iii) the government maintains a strong commitment to finance
the education sector and there are no budget constraints despite the financial crises (both
at the international and domestic levels), the system has been able to continue to enroll
increasing numbers of children in grade 1 despite the deficit in numbers of new
classrooms built, and has been able to recruit more than enough teachers needed in
primary (grades 1-6); and (iv) the 57 % target of transition rate between elementary and
middle schools has been achieved and is at 59.6 %.

Despite the greater than expected admission rate into grade 1, challenges remain. The
primary completion rate (PCR) rose only to 59,6% of which 58.7% for boys and 60.4%
for girls; although this rate continues to increase, the target of 78% is unlikely to be

                                              4
attained by the end of the project is deemed unrealistic by the Government, the local
donor group and the World Bank team. High dropout rates notably at grade 1 (15%) and
at grade 5 (17%) is the main cause of the lower than expected PCR. Another main
challenge is to better coordinate the numerous initiatives to support improvements in
learning outcomes. An assessment of learning outcomes is ongoing and is expected to be
completed by October 2010. The knowledge will be reinvested in the next school year to
improve learning practices.

The project is rated Satisfactory, there are no outstanding audit reports, and disbursement
rate is 51%. The implementation and the disbursement are expected to accelerate in the
coming weeks since the procurement process for 28 junior secondary schools,
representing 31% of the credit, is completed and the work will start by end of October
2010.



PROPOSED CHANGES

   ·   Results/indicators :

As detailed in annex 1, the results framework has been modified. These modifications
are:

   ·   A revision of the end of project target for the primary completion rate indicator.
       The initial target was 78% and the new one is 65%.
   ·   The revision of the indicator related to the share of the government budget
       allocated to education in order to align it with the EFA benchmarking;
   ·   The reduction of the number of indicators by dropping those that have no baseline
       or target and are not monitored or are less relevant to measure the project
       outcomes.

   ·   Components

There is no major change in the project description, components and activities. The only
change is the introduction into the sub-component " block grants to schools and local
education structures" of an activity aimed at providing additional support to students
experiencing learning difficulties in math and reading during the summer vacation with
the involvement of civil society organization.

   ·   Institutional arrangements

Local Governments were expected to implement component 1.a which aims at
constructing 170 water points and 300 six-toilet blocks in existing elementary schools. At
mid-term review, the implementation of this sub-component had not started due to low
capacities at the local level. Therefore, Regional Development Agencies (ARDs) of


                                             5
Diourbel, Kaolack, Kaffrine, Louga, Thies and Saint-Louis have been granted the
responsibility for the implementation of the subcomponent.

       ·   Financing

There is no change on the total project cost and the detailed cost changes reflect minor
reallocations among components. .

              o Financing Plan :

The project financing plan has been modified to reflect the 14 month extension.

              o Reallocations

The project funds have been reallocated as in the table below. The re-allocations are less
than 5% of the total. The main changes are related to: (i) the increase in supporting
quality and management improvement at deconcentrated and schools levels; (ii) the
transfer of the capacity building activities from the IDA credit to the PHRD Grant that
will be the specialized source of funding for that kind of activity, (iii) the reallocation of
the unallocated category to support the deconcentrated and school level quality
improvement activities; (iv) the increase in the operational costs to support the 14 month
extension and to compensate for the under evaluation of the necessary resources for this
component during project preparation.

   ·   Procurement

The ARDs of Diourbel, Kaolack, Kaffrine, Louga, Thies and Saint-Louis will have the
procurement responsibilities of component 1.a. ARDs are regional structures which
support decentralized authorities in planning and procurement of infrastructure. An
assessment of the procurement capacities of the ARDs has been carried out by the
procurement specialist and determined that they have the capacity to implement the
remaining project activities and are expected to receive additional support as needed by
the STD and procurement consultancies.

ARDS are staffed with: a manager, a staff responsible for infrastructure (Engineer or
Superior Technician in civil works or water and sanitation), an accountant, and a
monitoring and evaluation agent. Although they have not had direct experience
implementing World Bank projects they were indirectly involved in through their role in
quality control of the procurement process during PNDL's implementation. However,
they will be further supported by STD (Services techniques Décentralisés). In addition
they will recruit firms and / or individual consultants to monitor and control the
implementation of infrastructure activities. The ARDs provided key inputs during the
bidding process for QEFA 2 and the first stage of the FTI-EFA CF grant.

   ·   Closing date

The project closing date for both the IDA credit and the PHRD grant has been extended
from October 30, 2010 to December 31, 2011. This extension is expected to ensure the
completion of project activities and to better achieve the project development objective.

   ·   Implementation schedule

The implementation schedule has been revised to reflect the extension of the project
closing date by 14 months.
