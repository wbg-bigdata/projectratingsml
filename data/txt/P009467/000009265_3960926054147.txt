1.*     The following report on a proposed development credit to Bagladesh
l*. SU  3&   siLle. for 1WA miULe.    mi.l             A       &.-.A           e.
The propose  credit would be on standard IDA tems, with 40 yers mturity,
and uould help finance an urban development project. The project would be
cofimauced by 1 W for UI$4.4 millioem
2.      Background.  Urban areas are ezpected to play an increasingly impor-
tant role in Bangladesh's economic development by providing essential serv-
ices, especially to the agricultural and industrial sectors. Changes in the
structure of the economy will have major implications for the quality of life
and for the efficiency of cities, particularly the use of limited resources
for enterprises and households to develop urban land more efficiently,
provide urban infrastructure and improve shelter. Over the next 20 years,
some two-thirds of the total population increase in Bangladesh is expected in
urban areas. The main contributing factors to this large population movement
are high population densities, landlessness and low incomes in rural areas,
exacerbated by frequent crop failure and flooding. The present urban popula-
tion of about 12 million is expected to increase to about 36 million over the
next 20 years. The cities of Dhaka (3.0 million), the capital, and Chit-
tagong (1.5 million), the main port, currently account for about 40X of the
urban population and are expected to reach 9.4 million and 4.3 million
respectively by the year 2000. In Dhaka, with a 361 share of national
large-scale manufacturing, the informal sector will be critical to future
labor absorption. Key agencies responsible for urban development are (a) the
Ministry of Local Government, Rural Development and Cooperatives (MLG); (b)
the Municipal Corporations; (c) the Water and Sewerage Authorities (WASAs) of
Dhaka and Chittagong; and the Ministry of Works (MOW). A review of the urban
sector in 1981 and of urban government management and finance in 1985
proposed that the Government: (a) reduce large-scale public subsidies of
conventional shelter programs through major adjustments in site layouts,
infrastructure and building standards and through improved pricing and cost
recovery; (b) improve management of municipal services (solid waste collec-
tion, sanitation, storm drainage and urban road maintenance and traffic
management) through new approaches, design standards, operations and main-
tenance; and (c) strengthen local financial management practices, par-
ticularly resource mobilization (property tax assessment, rate limits, and
tax administration), budgeting, accounting and investment programming by city
managers at the local level and financial monitoring by the MLG at the
national level.
3.      Rationale for IDA Involvement.  The project forms an integral part of
IDA's sector development strategy and complements its assistance in the
ongoing Third Dhaka Water Supply and Sanitation Project and the Second Chit-
tagong Water Supply Project. Through the project, IDA would support an
efficient approach to city-wide environmental improvements, increasing the
supply of qffordable urban land and infrastructure, and improving municipal
management ?ractices and resource mobilization in Bangladesh's two largest



-2-
cities.  Over the *ieiwr-teri, the proj.ct would eotribute to the dv.lop-
ment of similar approaches in int<rmediat citiest strengthen urban manage-
ment, planning and investment programing in NLC and NOV agencieas and focus
public agencies on key aspects of urban developent strategy. IDA's involve-
ment would also afford Bangladesh the opportunity to draw more *xtensively on
the experiences of other countries.
4.' '  ''P'ro  et     tives.  pThe pincipal' ob'jctive "'o  the pop-a-ftproe'ct
are to: (a) improve the efficiency and effectiveness of planning, anaging
&n4 operating mnicdpal services, with particular emphasis on those having
immediate environmental impact in the more densely populated low-income areas
of Dhaka and Chittagong; (b) demonstrate replicable, cost-effective and
affordable approaches to urban land development and shelter for middle- and
low-income families through more efficient land use with significant reduc-
tion in the cost of plots, and through full cost recovery with positive
interest rates; and (c) strengthen the planning, management and financial
capacity of key local and national sector agencies: MOW for urban land
development and MLC and the Municipal Corporations for the provision and
management of municipal services.
5.      Project Description.  The principal components and subprojects are:
(a) Environmental Improvements comprising (i) Stormwater drainage and flood
control - including a stormwater relief drain in Central Chittagong and 29 km
of minor channel improvements in four drainage areas of Chittagong
(US$11.6 million equivalent); major drainage rehabilitation subproject on 4
km of the lower Dholai Khal in Dhaka (US$20.6 million equivalent); (ii) Solid
Waste  Collection and Disposal - including improvement in the management of
solid waste operations in Dhaka and Chittagong; provision of appropriate
solid waste vehicles; maintenance workshops; development of new sanitary
landfill sites in both cities (US$12.7 million equivalent); (iii) Sanitation
- including the rehabilitation of about 3,000 existing septic tanks, provi-
sion of 900 new septic tanks and 40 public toilets in Chittagong (US$3.3
million equivalent); (iv) Improvements in low-income areas - including three
pilot settlements (comprising 90,000 persons) in Dhaka. Improvement, (US$6.2
million equivalent) would include roads and footpaths, water supply and low
cost sanitation, gas distribution, surface drainage, solid waste collection
and regularized 99 year land leases; (b) Area Development and Shelter on
41 hectares of land in Chittagong to provide about 4,150 serviced residential
plots and 50 small scale comercial plots for low and middle income
beneficiaries. The subproject (OS$6.6 million equivalent) includes site
preparation, roads and footpaths, storm drains, street lighting, sanitation,
water and gas distribution and areas for schools, clinics and other community
facilities. Optional hire-purchase arrangements for plots and building loans
would be available to beneficiaries, to be repaid over 25 years at not less
than 13S interest. This interest rate would be reviewed periodically and
adjusted to maintain a positive rate in real terms. Bot.& this subproject and
that in (iv) above represent pilot undertakings in Bangladesh with the objec-
tive of having them replicated in other areas; and (c) Institutional Develop-
ment, comprising technical assistance (TA) for establishing project implemen-
tation units and studies of municipal management and finance, manpower



-3-
development and managerial reforms in local govern ent (US$4.6 million). The
project, to be carried out over *ight ,ears, provides funds for civil works;
equipment, materials and tools$ plots and buildiag loans; consultants for
design, supervision ond managmeut; and for technical assistaae and studies.
The total cost of the project is estimated at US$65.6 million equivalent,
vith a foreign exchange component of US$18.? millioa (321 of total cost,
excluding duties and taxes).  A su_ary of costs and the financing plan are

19645-19640 are attached. The Staff Appraisal Report Vo. 6287-BD, dated June
1, 1988, also is being distributed separately.
6       Agreed Actions.  TheCGovernment carried out the following actions
prior to negotiations: (a) confirmed approval of the three Project Proformas
(project documents prepared by implementing agencies) by the ?-oject Evalua-
tion Comittee of the Planning Commission of the Ministry of Planning; (b)
submitted to IDA for review a detailed plan for resettlement of the project
affected people in the area of the Dholai Khal drainage improvement in Dhaka;
and (c) submitted to IDA the name of the financial institution to manage MOW
mortgage payment collections - the Agrani Bank. The Government informed IDA
at negotiations that formal arrangements with the Port Authority to allow
construction of a critical stormwater culvert through the port area have not
yet been finalized. Assurances were received that evidence of such an agree-
ment would be sent to IDA before mid-July 1988. Assurances were given and
agreements reached at negotiations confirming: (a) the proposed arrangement
with the financial institution selected to manage MOW mortgage payment col-
lections; (b) the proposed final resettlement plan for the project affected
people in the area of the Dholai Khal drainage improvement; (c) agreements
with the electricity, water, gas, education and municipal authorities to
provide and implement these services for the area development subproject;
(d) that Government will maintain a core of skilled staff in the Project
Implementation Units, including Chief Financial Positions in Dhaka and Chit-
tagong Municipal Corporations; (e) hat engineering design consultants for
Dholai Khal and Sheikh Mujib Road dtainage improvements to be engaged by
October 15, 1988; (f) that procurement will be :n accordance with IDA
Guidelines; and (g) that the Operational Action Plans, which are satisfactory
to IDA, would be updated annually and would serve as basis for monitoring
project implementation.
7.      Benefits.  Economic benefits under the proposed project are expected
from:  (a) improved efficiencies in planning, managing and financing
municipal services; and (b) demonstration of more cost-effective and affor-
dable approaches to urban land development and shelter. The area development
subproject in Chittagong (about 10% of project costs) and environmental
improvement component in Dhaka's low-income settlements (about 9% of project
costs) would have directly quantifiable benefits consisting of increased land
values; the internal economic rates of return are 13% for area development
and 48% for improvements in low-income areas. The Dholai Khal drainage



rehabilitatioa componet (representing aout 28Z of project costs), also bag
an internal eonomic rate of return of M.;
B.      Risks.  Risks incle  the possible Leak of sustained ee_itae_t oe
the partete Dhak, and Chittagong Muicipal Corporations to raise suffi-
cient revemus to cover projoct iae_tme t and debt service; difficulties in
attractin$ aD msintaiing qualified persoanel for tiasly implemetation; and
td    t4 ~ Ctftln4C t    1s    the- nrdnilt -iii4. -he
project provides for (a) proce&ural reform in local property tax adinListra-
tion and grsfual introduction of reassssmatste (b) manpower development
through technical assistance and studies for NW and NW during the ftrst
five years of project impleaentation; and (c) strengthening the planning
cells of thn two sector ministries.
9.      Recommendation.  I am satisfied that the proposed credit would comply
with che Articles of Agreement of the Association and reco  end that the
Executive Directors approve the proposed credit.
