NANGANG AND TAEGU WTRER SUPPLY PROJECT
Loan and Proiect Summarv
Borrover:     Republic of Korea
Beneficiaries: Industrial Sites and Water Resources Development
Corporation (ISWACO) and Taegu City.
Amount:       $38 million equivalent.
Ter=s:        Repayable in 15 years including 3 years of grace,. at
the standard variable rate.
Relendite
Terms:   Government would relend $23 million of the proceeds of
the loan to Taegu City for the Taegu Water System (TWS)
on the same terms and conditions as for the Bank loan
plus a 0.05X p.a. handling charge. After completion of
the Namgang Regional System (ZRS), its assets and the
corresponding portion of the Bank loan amounting to $15
million, would be transferred to ISWACO on the same
terms and conditions as the Bank loan plus a 0.05% p.a.
handling charge. ISUACO and Taegu City would bear the
foreign exchange risk.
praiLec
DescriDtion:  The proposed project consists of two water supply
components: the NIS, for 13 municipalities in the
Kyeongnam Province and th.e TWS for the city of Taegu.
The project would improve water services to about 2
million persons and provide water to 520,000 additional
persons by 1991. The NRS includes a vater intake and
about 80 kms of transmission pipelines with a capacity
of 115,000 metric tons per day (tpd), a treatment plant
with first stage capacity of 75,000 tpd, and storage
reservoirs of 12,000 tons capacity. Complementary
distribution networlks i: the two main project cities
are being cofinanced by the Asian Development Bank
(ADB).
The TWS includes water intake and transmission
facilities from the Nakdong river, a 400,000 tpd vater
treatment plant, about 80,000 ton capacity reservoirs,
the  expansion  of distribution  networks,  the
rehabilitation of existing networks and a study for
improving the organization of water and severage
services.
Risks:        There are no special risks in the project. The
implementation schedule is feasible based on previous
project experience. To avoid a possible delay in
constructing complementary distribution works
Government provided assurances that complementary works
for the DRS would be completed by December 31, 1988.

I. mx WATE  SUPPLY AUID SANrTAT3ON SXCTO
Country Background
1.01       Korea's population in 1984 was 40.6  million.  Its
population density of 410 persons/sq km is one of the highest in the
world; it is also one of the most urbanized of the developing
countries. The overall population growth rate has decreased from 3X
in 1960 to about 1.5Z at present. The urban population in the 187
largest municipalities, which represents 60Z of the total, has been
increasing by 5Z p.a. or about three times the estimated growth rate
of the total population. By the end of the century, the population
living in municipalities of more than 50,000 inhabitants is expected
to include about 80Z of the total population. This rapid urbanization
has overextended all urban services, especially water supply. Coupled
with accelerated industrial growth and the relatively low priority
given to the sector earlier, this has led to a decline in the quality
of the environment and in water shortages with rationing in many
cities. Since the 1970s, the Government has given increased priority
to social infrastructure which has resulted in significant
improvements in the water supply and sanitation sectors and
contributed to improvements in public health. Waterborne diseases
have declined steadily since 1971. The crude death rate also declined
from 13 to 7 per thousand persons between 1960-81, while life
expectancy increased from 53 to 66 years in this period.
Sector Or2anization
1.02      There is no single agency with overall responsibility for
the sector. At the Central Government level, four Ministries are
directly involved in the sector. The Ministry of Construction (HOC).
through its Water and Sewerage  -ureau, is responsible for the
planning, design and construction of major water and sewerage works.
The Industrial Sites and Water Resources Development Corporation
(ISWACO), a semi-autonomous public corporation under HOC, operates
regional systems providing water in bulk to groups of municipalities
and industrial zones and builds and operates multipurpose dams. The
Ministry of Rome Affairs (MOHA), through its Local Finance Bureau,
oversees the operation of municipal Water Bureaus (Mes), including the
approval of bonds, loans and tariffs and the expansion of distribution
and storage facilities. The WBs are semi-autonomous organizations,
responsible for the design, construction, operation and financial
management of water works under the municipal governments. They have
separate budgets, revenues and expenditures. The Ministry of Health
and Social Affairs (HOHSA) is responsible for setting standards,
controlling the quality of drinking water and implementing rural water
supply programs. The Office of the Environment (OOE), under MOBSA,
sets, regulates and coordinates pollution control. The OOE also has to
approve, under the Environmental Preservation Law, projects which have
a substantial impact on the environment. Finally, the Economic
Planning Board (EPB) sets guidelines for tariff increases, approves
investment plans and allocates counterpart funds for the sector.



-2-
Sector Financing and Tariffs
1.03     Regional bulk water supplies to municipalities are financed
by HOC budgets and foreign loans. After completion, such projects and
their corresponding debt service liabilities are handed over to ISWACO
for operation and maintenance. ISWACO's national bulk water tariffs
are approved by MOC and EPB. Some 25-40Z of the investments by
municipal WBs are financed by MOC and provided to the WBs as loans, at
commercial rates, through the Korea Development Bank (KDB). The
balance of investment funds required are provided by the RBs' internal
generation (15-35%), sales of municipal bonds (20-40%), and foreign
loans. The EPB provides guidelines for the WB's maximum annual retail
tariff increases which reflect macroeconomic policies, and MORA
approves water tariffs for WBs within these guidelines. Water tariffs
have generally been sufficient to cover operation, maintenance, debt
service and some contribution to capital investments. In the rural
sector, a successful rural water supply program, scheduled for
completion in 1986, is being implemented, with the provincial
governments, the villages and MORSA each financing one third of the
costs. Severage is financed from municipal revenues, government and
foreign loans, and, starting in 1985, from sewerage tariffs. Despite
these measures financial problems still remain as described in para.
1.08.
Service Levels
1.04      About 55Z of the population was served by piped water in
1980, compared with 17% in 1960 and 33% in 1970. Service levels are
better (83%) in the large cities. However, many municipalities suffer
from restricted supply and water rationing. The quality of treated
water is uneven. Municipal water systems produce about 260 liters per
capita per day (lpcd), of which about half is for non-residential use.
To assist the Government resolve the problem of unaccounted-for water,
the Bank is providing support to leak detection programs in some 20
cities.
1.05      Only 8% of dvellings use severage systems; the rest use
septic tanks, cesspits, and night soil collection systems. Most of
the waste water from residential and industrial premises is discharged
untreated or partially treated into street drains. This, combined
with high leakage and the possibility of infiltration, exposes
distribution systems to the risk of contamination. Increased emphasis
is vow being given to sewerage and waste disposal (para. 1.06). Seoul
and Pusan, the two largest cities, and several other municipalities
have established combined waste and storm water collection systems and
sevage and night soil treatment plants, serving about one third of
their populations. The OOE and the municipalities are also enforcing
pollution control measures on industry and commerce in an effort to
improve the quality of rivers and the environment.



-3-
Sector Development
1.06      Sector investments in 1983 prices increased from $218
million in the Third Plan (1972-76). to $530 million in the Fourth
Plan (1977-81) and are forecast to reach $1,860 million during the
Fifth Plan (1982-86), with about half being financed from the
Government budget. Government objectives during the Fifth Plan include
preservation of water quality, replacement of obsolete equipment, and
expansion and construction of new sewerage and vater supply systems
and treatment plants. The target for the Fifth Plan is to increase
the population served by piped water from 55Z to 70Z by 1986. Given
the high rate of urban population growth, maintaining even the present
coverage requires substantial investments. The Fifth Plan provides
for a number of environmental pollution abatement measures, including
the improvement of the Ran River Basin (based on a Master Plan
completed in 1984). the expansion of combined severage systems, and
the building of night soil and sewage treatment plants in some 100
cities and towns. Government plans to increase the percentage of
population served by sewage treatment plants from 6% to 35X and sewage
treatment capacity from 0.5 million tpd to 8 million tpd between 1980
and 1991. Sanitation investments in the Fiftb Plan are estimated at
$800 million in 1982 prices.
Sectoral Issues and Constraints
1.07      Although Korea has achieved impressive progress in the
provision of water services, many problems still remain. At the
present growth rate of 5% pa., the urban population doubles every 14
years which, combined with rapid industrialization, dramatically
increases water requirements. Consequently, in spite of a per capita
production of about 300 lpcd in several major cities, significant
water shortages continue requiring continuous investments in the
sector.
1.08     The main outstanding sectoral issues, which are being
discussed with the Government, are summarized beluaw:
(a) Financial.  Although water supply projects require lengthy
construction periods and reach full capacity only several years after
commissioning, the investment funds available to most muiicipalities
are short-term bonds, internal casb generation and annually approved
government contributions. This results in project investments with
relatively short design horizons being favored. This problem could be
alleviated with the establishment of financial mechanisms, presently
being discussed, for long-term financing of urban and water
investments. The lack of nation-wide financial criteria for setting
WBs' retail tariffs and ISWACO's bulk water tariffs also creates
uncertainty about their capacity to assume debt service liabilities
and finance long-term project investments. Some projects are financed
by grants from Government even when debt financing would be preferable
and affordable. ISWACO's bulk water tariffs for treated and raw water
have a national impact and affect many municipalities. A country-wide
study of the bulk water tariff policy would be undertaken by ISWACO
under Loan 2491-KO and presented to the Bank for comments by June 30,
1986. This study would be financed and implemented by ISWACO in

coordination with EPB and HOC. Assurances were obtained during
negotiations that the bulk tariff study including recommendations for
the NRS would be completed not later than June 30, 1986. Confirmation
was also obtained during negotiations that the consultants for this
study would be appointed not later than August 31, 1985.
(b) Oritanization in Interurban Areas.  The WBs are generally well
operated and maintained. However, municipal water systems are
independently planned and operated even where contiguous
municipalities constitute a single integrated urban area. Coordinated
services would increase efficiency, remove unfairness in the access
to water or severage services, eliminate duplication of investments
and reduce dependence on government grants. To address this problem
MORA engaged the Korea Public Administration Research Institute to
prepare a country-wide feasibility study of the organization of urban
water supply services. The study, completed in 1984, is now being
reviewed by the Ministries concerned and the Bsak. MHOA also intends
to undertake a detailed study of the organization of water services in
the Hetropolitan Region (comprising some 40 municipalities around
Seoul City). This study would be completed and made available to the
Bank for comments.
Cc) Division of Responsibilities. Government has hitherto
successfully implemented a large program of sector investments.
However, there is some lack of coordination between the Ministries
involved in the sector, in particular between HOC and MORA. This is
partially due to the division of responsibilities and is a problem
common to other sectors as well because of the Government's vertical
organization. A clearer division of responsibilities and closer
coordination is desirable. An Inter-Ministerial Committee (INC)
established under Loan 2072-KO meets on an ad-hoc basis to discuss
particular sector coordination issues. Inter-Ministerial meetings are
presently discussing the setting up of mechanisms for sector
financing -
Cd)  Independent Water and Severage Orsanizations. HOC's Water and
Sewerage Divisions were reorganized under a new Bureau in 1984.
However, at the municipal level, with the exception of Seoul City, the
responsibility for water and sewerage rests with two separate Bureaus.
Increasing urban population and density, higher water consumption and
industrialization requires a large effort to improve severage services
and reduce pollution. In most countries, the integration of water ancz
sewerage services under the same management has proven efficient in
terms of staffing, finances, accounting, planning and cotrdination. It
is important to study the feasibility of this integration for the
particular conditions of Korea. Assurances were obtained during
negotiations that MORA would carry out the review of the
organization of water and severage services in Taegu City and that the
conclusions of this review would be made available to the Bank for
comments not later than December 31, 1986.
(e)  Scarce Water Resources.  Korea has limited water resources.  Per
capita surface water runoff is only about 1,700 cu m or about 40K and
12Z respectively of the water runoff of Japan and the United States.
Since two thirds of the annual precipitation of 1,160 mm occurs during



the rainy season (July to September), increased water demand requires
the construction- of multipurpose reservoirs and regional water
transmission systems with long transmissior pipelines and expensive
pumping. The cost of such facilities is increasing rapidly due to the
shortage of suitable dam sites and increasing land costs. It is
important, therefore, to improve water resources management,
especially for the four largest rivers - Han, Nakdong, Geum and
Yongsan - the basins of which contain 70S of the industry and urban
population. Government's plans for these river basins include the
implementation of water conservation programs in the municipalities,
master plans for the use of water, and rational pricing policies to
help curtail water demand.
(f) Air and Water Pollution. High population density, increased
ownership of vehicles, the use of coal for heating, and especially the
wastes generated by rapid industrialization have resulted in a
deterioration of air and vater quality. The Government enacted the
Environmental Preservation Law in 1981, and the OOE and the
municipalities are starting country-wide programs for severage and
sewage treatment and control of industrial air and vater pollution.
Bank Obiectives and Lendin_ in the Sector
1.09      The Bank's lending strategy is to finance high priority
investments included in government programs and through these
operations maintain a dialogue on important sector issues. Through its
support of Government's programs for water supply and sanitation, the
Bank has the folloving key objectives:
(a) to promote sound investment planning with emphasis on least-cost
alternatives, improve the efficiency of the use of water
resources, safeguard the environment and ensure that the benefits
of water and sanitation reach the poor;
(b)  to strengthen sector institutions anui improve coordination; and
(c) to develop a solid financial basis for the sector, through
improvements in accounting, financial and management information
services, and the adoption of appropriate policies for financing
and cost recovery.
Experience with Past Lendin'
1.10      The Bank has financed three projects in the water supply
sector since 1982: the First Water Supply Project (Loan 2072-R0) for
expansion of water services in five cities; the Second Water Supply
Project (Loan 2350-KO) for the Nakdong Barrage to increase vater
availability for municipalities in the Nakdong basin, initiate leak
detection programs and improve the financial management of WU.; and
the Metropolitan Region Water Supply Project (Loan 2491-KO), approved
in February 1985, to provide bulk treated water to 25 municipalities,
and to study bulk water tariff policies, analyze the organization of
water services in the Metropolitan Region, and improve ISWACO's
financial management. All these projects are being implemented on
schedule and compliance with loan covenants is satisfactory. Bank



-6-
projects have also resulted in significant cost savings through
selection of least cost investments. Important sector improvement
measures are being undertaken by Government. These include: (a) the
establishment of sewerage tariffs for the main cities; (b)
introduction of improved accounting regulations and procedures for all
WBs; (c) agreement to introduce marginal cost pricing for the water
available from the Nakdong Barrage;   (d) the establishment of
financial performance targets for ISWACO and several WBs; Ce) the
transfer of appropriate leak detection technology; (f) the
introduction of microcomputers for accounting and financial management
to WBs; and (g) the introduction of environmental management programs.
The Bank liaises closely with other international agencies supporting
the sector.
Rationale for Bank Involvement
1.11      Bank support for this project would continue, expand and
sustain the above mentioned sector improvements. Bank's involvement in
project preparation has already resulted in the adoption of a less
expensive and more efficient treated water system (para. 6.04). The
project assist in applying sound pricing policies and tariffs, improve
the organization of water and sewerage services in Taegu and achieve
the objectives described in para. 3.02. Institutional changes,
particularly those affecting several Ministries, are politically
sensitive and would require time to be addressed.

II. WATER DENIED
Introduction
2.01      Water consumption has been rising rapidly in Korea. The
percentage of population with house connections increased from 33% in
1970 to 61% in 1984. Although the additional population served
belongs to the lower income brackets, which vould normally reduce the
per capita consumption, the water production per person for the whole
country increased from 117 lpcd in 1970, to 240 lpcd in 1980 and 273
lpcd in 1983. This rapid increase in per capita demand, 6.7% p.a.
during the last 13 years, is explained by the progressive alleviation
of water supply shortages, rapid industrialization and urbanization,
and higher living standards. The same factors would continue to
increase water consumption in the future, but at a slover rate.
NamganR Regional System (XRS)
2.02       The proposed NRS subproject would provide treated water to
13 municipalities including the cities of Samcheonpo and Chungmu in
south-eastern Korea, (Map IERD 18965R). In 1983, the population of
these municipalities was 251,000 persons. Water shortages have been a
major hindrance to development of the area, which lags considerably
behind other areas. In 1983, the population served by house
connections in these 13 municipalities was 138,000 persons (55Z of
the population). Water production was 17,850 metric tons or 130 lpcd.
Unaccounted-for water (37%) reduced the water consumption to only 82
lpcd. Access to vater services is uneven, and no public water supply
is available in nine of the thirteen municipalities. In the other
four, water is rationed and dry season consumption can be limited to
less than 40 lpcd. These water shortages have resulted in serious
conflicts ,etween municipalities for the use of limited water from
ground water sources. The region does, however, have good development
potential for tourism, fishery and export-related industrial
development. Infrastructure for these purposes is presently being
constructed. Ongoing works include three industrial estates and a new
harbor in Samcheonpo, and a large tourist development in Chungmu.
These two cities are expected to require about 80% of the NRS's
capacity. The NRS has priority in government plans for the sector
because of the water shortages sand rationing, and the development
potential of the region. A description of the existing water supply
facilities for the 13 municipalities is presented in Annex 1.
2.03     Population projections for the IBS, based on MOC's "Second
Comprehensive National Physical Development Plan 1982-91", the
feasibility study (para. 3.01) and appraisal projections indicate that
the population in the proj2ct uunicipalities would increase from
251,000 persons in 1983 to 316,000 in 1991 (2.9% p.a.) and 415,000 in
2001 (2.7Z p.a). However, the smaller municipalities generally have
small or negative rates of population growth (Annex 3 A). Demand
projections for the two cities assume that over 90% of the population
would be connected within the next ten years. However, some of the
project municipalities include many small villages surrounding the
main town, some of which are distant or separated from the pipeline



- 8 -
route by physical obstacles. In such cases it is estimated that only
70% of the population vould be served by 1991. The percentage of
population with house connections is expected to increase from 55Z in
1983 to 75Z in 1988 and 82% in 1991. Detailed population and demand
projections are presented in Annex 3 and suzmarized in Graph 2.1.
2.04      The feasibility study for the NRS estimated the water
consumption using statistics from other Korean cities which have no
serious water rationing. These projections are reasonable. Water
consumption is estimated to increase from 11,230 tpd (averaging 82
lpcd in the four municipalities served) in 1983, to 48,000 tpd (172
lpcd) in 1991, and 77,000 tpd (188 lpcd) in 2001. The water supplied
by the proposed project would increase eveu faster. This is because
Chungmu City would have to abandon most of its present water sources,
which belong to other towns (not included in the project), and because
the increase in water demand by Samcheonpo's industrial estate would
gradually reduce the water available from the industrial pipeline. The
capacity of the first stage treatment plant and pumping stations is
75,000 tpd, to be expanded to 115,000 tpd by 1992. A second stage
treatment plant would be built at this time, providing a total
capacity of 42,300 tpd to the Sancheonpo branch and 72,700 tpd to the
Chungau branch. The pipelines are dimensioned for the capacity
requirements up to the year 2001.
2.05      Leak detection programs and network rehabilitation works
being constructed under an ADB-fimanced project are expected to reduce
unaccounted-for water in Chungau and Sancheonpo from 37% to 30Z by
1991. The total unaccounted-for water, including the new systems, is
expected to be 28Z after 1991.
Availability of Water for the IRS
2.06      Studies made of water resources available in the Nangang
Reservoir indicate that if the reservoir is operated as originally
designed, there would be sufficient water available to meet all
projected demands including the additional demand of this project.
This would require completion of land acquisition and compensation for
some 340 ha, which would allow the reservoir to operate, as originally
designed, at a high flood level of 39.5 m. ISWACO operates the
reservoir and is undertaking a satisfactory program for land
acquisition. Assurances were obtained during negotiations that to
provide adequate water supply to the NRS municipalities MOC would
complete a program of land acquisition in accordance with a schedule
satisfactory to the Bank. At present a considerable volume of water
from the reservoir is used by the Korea Electric Pover Company (KEPCO)
for relatively small pover generation (12,600 KW, because of the low
hydraulic head). This power can easily be supplied from other power
stations. The NRS would have sufficient water available for municipal
demand at all times if the volume of water used by KEPCO is curtailed,
and appropriate compensation is paid for the resulting reduction in
powe r generation. HOC confirmed during negotiations that public water
sup ply would have priority in the allocation of water resources from
the Namgang Reservoir.

Taetu Water System (TWS)
2.07        Taegu. with a population of two million persons, is the
third largest city in Korea (Map IBRD 18966K). Taegu is one of three
Special Cities and reports directly to MORA rather than to the
provincial goverment. Water consumption in 1984 was IIl million tons
(160 lpcd). The population served by house connections was 1.9 million
persons, (94Z), but access to water is uneven, with levels of service
between 80Z and 98% in different parts of the city. Under the TWS
particular attention has been given to reach the poorest, unserved
areas. The computer simulation of the water networks shows that after
completion the project would solve present problems of vater
rationing, low pressures, intermittent supply and provide sufficient
water to all neighborhoods.
2.08      Taegu's population growth averaged  5.1% p.a. during the
last 15 years, compared to an average of 5.9% p.a. for the 52 largest
cities. MOC's population projections estimate that Taegu's growth rate
will slow down, with its population increasing from 2.03 million in
1984 to 2.60 million in 1991 (3.6% p.a.) and 3.15 million in 2001
(1.9% p.a). Taegu is planning to increase the percentage of the
population with house connections from 94% in 1984 to 98% in 1991. The
additional population served would increase by 400,000 persons by 1991
and 780,000 persons by 1995. Detailed population and demand
projections for the TWS are presented in Annex 3 B and summarized in
Graph 2.2.
2.09      The feasibility study for the TWS (para. 3.01) and the
city's own projections forecast a large increase in water demand, due
to: (a) the elimination of rationing and improved pressures upon
completion of the First Water Supply Project; (b) rising standards of
living e.g., more extensive use of flush toilets, private baths, aud
water consuming appliances like washing machines; and Cc) increasing
industrial and commercial development. This has been the experience in
similar cities in Japan and other developed countries. These
projections also assume that per capita water production would
increase from 272 lpcd in 1984 to 430 lpcd in 1991 (6.8% p.a.), and to
570 lpcd in 2001 (2.9% p.a.). Under the city projections, the project
capacity would be fully used by 1992, and it would thus be necessary
to start the construction of an additional dam (Daecheon) by MOC, and
the corresponding treatment plant (Geunho) and pipeline facilities by
Taegu within the next few years.
210       The demand projections were revised and scaled down by the
consultants (KECC) during the appraisal. The demand projections used
for the appraisal assume a slower and more gradual increase in per
capita water consumption and a reduction of the unaccounted-for water
(Annex 12, para. 16). Under the appraisal projections water
consumption is expected to increase from 263,000 tpd (146 lpcd) in
1983 to 556,000 tpd (218 lpcd) in 1991 (Annex 33), and the project
capacity of 400,000 tpd would satisfy Taegu's water demand up to 1995.
If the water demand increases as projected by the city, the financial
position of TWB and the economic rate of return for the TWS would be
even better than the appraisal projections.



- ll -
2.11     Unaccounted-for water in Taegu rose from 32Z to 38X in 1984,
when pressures were increased upon the expansion of water capacity
and the completion of works under the First Water Supply Project.
Reducing Taegu's leakage is difficult because of the large proportion
of old distribution pipes in the system. In 1985, a leak detection
program, with the support of foreign experts, was started, aiming to
reduce unaccounted-for water to less than 3OZ by 1990. This program
would also establish a permanent unit in TWB for leak detection and
control. A considerable investment in network rehabilitation is
partially financed under the proposed project, with the remainder
wholly financed from internal cash generation.
III. THE PROJECT
Origin and Formulation
3.01     The proposed project is an important part of Goverr-ent's
plans to upgrade and expand water services in water-scarce regicas and
urban areas. The project was identified and feasibility studies
completed under Loan 2072-KO. Detailed engineering for the NRS is
being financed by MOC and prepared by Woo Bo Engineers Inc. (Korea),
in association with Renardet Engineering (France). Detailed
engineering for the TWS is being financed by Taegu City and prepared
by Korea Engineering Consultants Corporation (KECC) with the
assistance of Nihon Suido and Original Engineering (Japan).
Proiect Obiectives
3.02    The main project objectives are to: (a) provide adequate and
reliable water supply to 13 municipalities located in a water scarce
and poor area of the country and promote their social and industrial
development; (b) increase water supply coverage in Taegu and ensure
adequate water services particularly to the low-income population; (c)
review the organization of water and sewerage services in Taegu, which
is expected to serve as a model for other cities; (d) extend the scope
of ISWACO's national bulk water tariff policy study to include the
NRS; and (e) promote sector development through a continued dialogue
with the Government (paras. 1.08-1.11).
Pro iect Description
3.03     The proposed project consists of two water supply components
in the Kyeongsang Region: the Namgang Regional System (NRS) and the
Taegu Water System (TWS). The subprojects have been approved by the
National Assembly and would be implemented simultaneously between
1985 and 1988. Details of the subprojects are presented in Annex 2,
and a summary description is presented below:
(a)  Namzan2 Re2ional System. This subproject would provide treated
water to 13 municipalities, including two cities (Chungmu and
Samcheonpo), and eleven towns (eups) and villages (myeons). The
NRS includes a water intake and raw water pumping station from



- 12 -
the existing Namgang Reservoir, a raw water transmission
pipeliue, a new water treatment plant (75,000 tpd), a high level
reservoir on the Chungmu branch line and two main transmission
pipelines, one serving five towns and Samcheonpo City, and the
other serving six towns and Chungau City. This subproject also
includes consultant services for project supervision and for
studying ISWACO's bulk water tariff policies.
(b)   Taetu Water System.  This subproject would eliminate water
rationing in Taegu after 1988, and provide water supply to some
780,000 additional persons by 1995. It includes the expansion of
the vater intake and pumping station from the Nakdong River, the
expansion of the Dasa treatment plant by 400,000 tpd, and
additional transmission and distribution facilities to use this
capacity and distribute water to all areas of the city. The TWS
includes additional booster pumping stations, service reservoirs,
the   replacement of old and leaking distribution pipes and the
improvement of instrumentation and control of the whole system.
Consultant services for project supervision and the review by
KOHA of the organization of water and sewerage services in Taegu
City are also included in the project.
Complementary Works
3.04      Complementary distribution works necessary to utilize the
water delivered by the NRS have been designed and are under
construction for the two main cities of Chungmu and Samcheonpo with
parallel cofinancing from ADB (Small Towns Water Supply Sector
Project). The two cities would use about 80% of the project capacity.
The eleven other municipalities would implement a program of
distribution improvements that would be financed by MNOH's Provincial
Water Fund. Assurances were obtained during negotiations that the
distribution works requ-    for the municipalities of the IRS works
would be coordinated by : C and MOHA and implemented not later than
December 31, 1988.
Proiect Cost
3.05      The estimated project cost, including physical and price
contingencies, is W 84.5 billion ($103.7 million), of which W 34.6
billion ($42.5 million) is the foreign exchange component. Taxes and
duties are estimated at about $8 million equivalent. The base cost is
expressed in June 1985 prices. The project is in an advanced stage of
preparation, ard cjst estimates are based on detailed designs, HOC's
annually updated rates and prices and recently awarded contract prices
for similar works. Physical contingencies have been estimated at 10%
of total base costs. Technical assistance for construction supervision
is included in the project costs and requires about 100 man-months of
foreign consultants and about 340 man-months of local consultants.
Estimated price increases over the project period amount to about 7X
of base costs plus physical contingencies. Price increases for
foreign costs are estimated at 5% for 1985, 7.5% for 1986, and 8% for
1987-1988. Price increases for local costs are estimated at 2.5% for
1985, 5% for 1986, and 5.5% for 1987-1988. It is estimated that
exchange rate adjustments would, on the average, maintain "purchasing

are presented in Annex 4.
FinanciuR Plan
3.06        The  proposed  Bank  loan  of  $38 million  would  finance  36.6Z of
the project cost (39.72 excluding taxes), or about 31.1% of the total
financing requirement of $122.3 million, including the complementary
distribution works of the municipalities in the NRS and the interest
during construction, (Table 3.2). The remaining funds would be
provided by Government contributions for the NRS ($26.2 million,
21.4%), Taegu City bonds (19 million, 15.52), Taegu Water Bureau
internal cash generation ($19.8 million, 16.22), Government loans
($8.2 million,  6.7%),   ADB ($4 million,  3.37),  and  internal  generation
and bonds by the cities in the NRS ($'/.1 million, 5.8%). This
financing plan was reviewed and confirmed during negotiations. After
project completion, the assets and debt service liabilities of the NRS
would be transferred to ISWACO. Taegu City will own and operate the
TWS subproject.

Procurement
3.07     Procurement arrangements for the project are summarized in
Table 3.3. The contract packaging ensures efficient project
implementation. The NRS complementary distribution works would be
procured folloving ADB and local procurement guidelines. The main
civil works and the bulk of the materials and equipment, aggregating
about $66 million will be procured through International Competitive
Bidding (ICB) following Bank guidelines. A preference margin in
accordance with Bank guidelines would be granted for domestic goods at
bid evaluation. TUS civil works contracts, under $2 million each, and
aggregating about $14 million, and pipe materials contracts, under
$0.5 million each, and aggregating about $5 million, would be procured
through Local Competitive Bidding (LCB) procedures which have been
reviewed and are satisfactory to the Bank. One civil works contract
for intake works estimated at about $1 million and a control equipment
contract estimated at about $2 million would be negotiated with the
respective contractors who completed the first stage of these works
for the TWS in 1984, under ICB contracts financed under Loan 2072-KO.
This vould be economical and ensure compatibility of works and
equipment and validity of guarantees. A provision has been made that
urgently needed goods including specialized leak detection equipment
as agreed with the Bank, estimated to cost not more that $0.25 million
per contract and aggregating not more than $1.0 million may be
procured through prudent shopping. Due to the experienced and
competitive local construction industry, foreign contractors are not
expected to be interested in bidding for civil works contracts.
3.08     Prior Bank review would be needed for civil works contracts
over $2 million and goods contracts over $0.25 million, which include
about 60Z of the value of all contracts. This is adequate since both
implementing agencies are well experienced in Bank financed
procurement. Advance contracting has been included at Government's
risk for consultant services for about $2 million. Consultants for
project supervision would be selected in accordance with Bank
guidelines.
Disbursements
3.09      Proceeds of the Bank loan would be disburse,I against: (a)
35Z of civil works contracts; (b) 100% of the foreign expenditures and
100% of ex-factory local expenditures for equipment and materials; and
(c) 50% of the cost of consulting services. Disbursements under
contracts for equipment and materials costing $250,000 equivalent or
less each would be made on the basis of statements of expenditure. A
Special Account of $1.5 million wo-ld be established in each
subproject to facilitate loan disbursements against eligible
expenditures under each of the two subprojects. The closing date of
the loan would be June 30, 1990.
Proiect Implementation
3.10     The project is in an advanced stage of preparation. General
Procurement Notices for both subprojects have appeared in the

"Development Forum" and prequalification is underway. Detailed
engineering would be completed by August 1985, and the first contract
would be avarded by December 1985 (Annex 5). TWB plans to appoint
consultants for assisting in supervision of the TWS before the award
of the first contract. This vas confirmed at negotiations. The
project would be constructed between December 1985 and December 1988
(Annex 5). The implementation schedule is realistic based on the
experience with similar projects in the sector, particularly the First
Water Supply Project, where Taegu and three other cities commissioned
their vater works in less than 36 months, and the other city, Kwangju,
completed its works, including a large dam, in under 42 months.
Disbursements of the Bank loan are expected to take four and a half
years, somewhat faster than the country disbursement profile. The
estimated disbursements are shown in Annex 6.
3.11     The NRS would be implemented by HOC and supervised by their
Pusan Regional Construction and Management Agency (RCXA), vith the
support of consultants. This office would designate four field
engineers under the Director of its Rivers' Improvement Division to be
resident at the project sites. HOC plans to retain, for supervision
of the IRS, the consultants engaged in the design of this subproject.
The appointment of consultants for assisting in supervision of the DRS
is a condition of disbursements for this component. MOC's Water and
Sewerage Bureau would provide coordination from Seoul as well as
liaison with the Bank. NOVA would review the organization of water and
sewerage services in Taegu City. ISWACO would be responsible for
taking over the project on completion and for the implementation of
the tariff studies with the assistance of consultants. TIB with the
supoort of consultants would implement the TIWS subproject. Both MOC
and TWB have adequate experience in implementing foreign assisted
projects. Charts 1 to 3 show these implementing arrangements. Land
acquisition and compensation for the NRS subproject involving some
17 ha is proceeding satisfactcrily. For the TUS subproject, most of
the necessary land is already under City ownership. The responsibility
for land acquisition and compensation, engineering, bid evaluation and
supervision would rest with the respective Project Offices.  Bidding
and contract awards would be the responsibility of the Office of
Supply (OSROK), the main Government procurement agency, which has wide
experience in both ICB and LCB for foreign assisted projects. For the
NRS, the complementary distribution works for the two beneficiary
cities are being implemented by HMOA and the cities with the support
of consultants. The complementary distribution works required for the
other eleven municipalities in the NRS would be financed and
implemented by the respective county offices. MOC's Water and Severage
Division and MORA's Local Finance Division would coordinate, arrange
financing and provide support for these programs.

Operation and Maintenance
3.12      The NRS facilities will be transferred to ISWACO for
operation and maintenance (para. 4.03). ISWACO presently
satisfactorily operates and maintains nine other bulk water supply
systems and has wide experience in this field. The TWB vould be
responsible for the operation and maintenance of the TWS facilities
constructed under the project.
Enviroimental Aspects
3.13    The project would improve health and environmental living
conditions of the population through the provision of safe water.
Rowever, while increasing water supply the project would also increase
the volume of waste water. Government is now starting to address this
problem and is giving priority to the planning and financing of a
country-wide program to provide improved collector and interceptor
severs and treatment facilities for urban areas. Starting in July
1985, the cities will collect severage tariffs, amounting to up to 50Z
of their vater tariffs, to finance improvements to waste water
collection and disposal systems. These improvement programs, when
completed, would help improve sanitation. Generally, municipalities in
Korea maintain efficient sanitation services like garbage collection
and disposal, street cleaning, septic tank and night soil collection
and disposal and maintenance of drains and water courses. Residents
are very conscious of the environment and maintain neighborhoods and
premises clean. These factors, particularly in the project
municipalities,   result in better neighborhood environmental
conditions than in comparable municipalities in most developing
countries.

IT. TE BORROWER AND EKIClTIEG AGEECIES
The Borrower
4.01     The borrower will be the Government which will relend the
Bank loan to Taegu Ciry for the TWS on the same terms and conditions
as the Bank loan plus a 0.05Z p.a. handling charge. After completion
of the NRS, its assets and the corresponding portion of the Bank loan
would be transferred to ISWACO on the same terms and conditions as the
Bark loan plus a 0.05Z pa. handling charge. The foreign exchange risk
would be borne by ISWACO and Taegu City. A Project Agreement covering
operation and maintenance and financial covenants would be executed
with ISWACO. Government would enter into a Subsidiary Loan Agreement
with Taegu City to onlend the Bank loan component for the TWS. Signing
of this Subs-diary Loan Agreement is a condition for effectiveness.
Namzanm Regional System (URS)
4.02     Imulementinx Astncy: Ministr, of Construction. The NRS would
be implemented by HOC (para. 3.11). After completion of construction
its assets and liabilities vould be transferred to ISWACO. MOC's Pusan
RCKA would be designated as the Project Office. The Pusan RCMA is
managed by a Director General and has the following Divisions: General
Services, Roads, Rivers' Improvement, Laboratory, and Special
Construction Offices. An office under the Director of the Rivers'
Improvement Division would be designated for supervision and
construction management. MOC confirmed during negotiations that a site
office, initially staffed by at least one field engineer,  would be
established by December 1, 1985. MOC's accounting procedures are
adequate. MOC's Accounts Department would be responsible for project
cost accounting, with internal audit from MOC's Inspector General's
Office, and external audit by the Board of Audit. Assurances were
obtained that within six months of the end of each fiscal year MOC
would send to the Bank a summary of the project cost accounts, as
audited by independent auditors acceptable to the Bank.
4.03     ODeratint Asencv: ISWACO. ISWACO would be responsible for
the operation, maintenance and debt payment for the NRS. Assurances
were obtained that a Transfer and Operations Agreement for the M.1, a
draft of which would be presented to the Bank for comments by December
31, 1987, would be signed with ISWACO prior to the completion of the
NRS. ISWACO is satisfactorily operating nine other regional systems
(Chart 2), which would provide bulk water to some 60 municipalities by
1988. ISWACO is also the borrower for three previous Bank loans being
executed satisfactorily: The Chungju Multipurpose Dam (Loan 1666-KO),
the Second Water Supply Project started in 1984, and the Metropolitan
Region Water Supply Project approved in February 1985.
4.04     ISWACO was established  on February 1, 1974, pursuant to the
law for the promotion of industrial sites and water resources
development, to: (a) undertake the development of industrial sites and
special areas; (b) construct, operate and maintain multipurpose dams
for water supply, irrigation, flood control and power generation; and
(c) operate regional water supply systems which provide raw or treated
bulk water for municipal and industrial use. ISWACO has planned and



- 20 -
constructed nine industrial estates and nev cities and six
multipurpose dams, and operates nine regional water supply systems.
The largest dams under construction are Hapcheon (financed by OECF),
the Nakdong Barrage (financed by Loan 2350-KO), and the Juan and Imba
Dams (also financed by OECF). Feasibility studies are being prepared
for five other vultipurpose dams which are expected to be built within
the next ten years.
4.05      ISWACO is managed by a Board of Directors, which includes
ISWACO's President, a representative of MOC and the Manager of the
Goverrment Invested Corporations. ISWACO's President is appointed by
the President of Korea. ISIWACO has a Vice-president, who is also
responsible for planning, and four other Directors (Administration,
Industrial Sites, Water Resources and Public Utilities) and an Auditor
(Chart 2). The directors are appointed by MOC for a period of three
years, and the Auditor for a two-year period. ISWACO has developed
into a large and competent organization with 15 departments, 18 local
offices and 1,278 employees, 422 of whom are in Taejeon at
headquarters and the others in local offices and at construction
sites. Many of ISWACO1= 500 engineers have been trained abroad, and,
working together with foreign consultants, have acquired considerable
experience in the design, construction and maintenance of large
projects. ISWACO has insurance against fire as well as for vehicles,
and is self-insured against other risks. ISWACO's financial statements
have been audited satisfactorily by independent private auditors.
Assurances were obtained during negotiations that ISWACO's financial
statements would continue to be independently audited, and that a copy
of the auditor's report would be sent to the Bank by July 1, six
months after the end of each fiscal year.
4.06      ISWACO's management is efficient, with administrative
expenses representing less than 5% of operational expenses. In May
1984, the Government enacted the Public Erterprise Reform Law,
providing more autonomy to public enterprises and creating mechanisms
to monitor their efficiency, in particular an annuAl evaluation used
to rank all public enterprises. This government ranking is then used
to award bonuses of up to six months' salary to all employees of the
best enterprises. ISWACO's management has, as a result, been very
receptive to ideas to improve itself. and under the Metropolitan
Region Water Supply Project is undertaking a study (to be completed by
December 31, 1986) to strengthen its financial management and
management information systems.
4.07      ISWACO's operations are well run, with sophisticated
telemetering and control systems, metering and regular maintenance
programs. Statistical information is adequate, water services are
reliable, unaccounted-for water is less than 5%, and accounts
receivable are less than 30 days. Accounting and payrolls are
computerized, and under the Second Water Supply Project.
microcomputers have been purchased and are being used for financial
projections and planning. To ensure proper maintenance of the NRS,
assurances were obtained from ISWACO during negotiations that it
would prepare a maintenance program for the NRS and send a copy to the
Bank for comments not later than December 31, 1987.

Taerm Water System (TUS)
4.08     ImulementinE and Operating Asency: Taetu Water Bureau (TWB)
The TWB would be responsible for the construction, operation and
maintenance of the TWS. TWB has an experienced stafA and has
satisfactorily implemented previous development projects, including
its component of the the First Water Supply Project. TWIB is a semi-
autouomous department within the City, with autonomous budget and
resources, and reports to the Mayor. TWBts budget is about one quarter
of the City's budget.
4.09     The TUB is managed by a Director General, and has three main
divisions responsible for: (a) Business: accounting, planning,
budgeting and cash management of TUB; (b) Engineering: planning
design and construction supervision (with the support of c-usultants3
of vaterworks expansions and local and international procurement (with
the support of OSROK); and (c) Naintenance and Supply: operation and
maintenance of treatment plants and distribution systems, construction
of small distribution networks and house connections. Under this last
division six Service Offices Cone for each district), are responsible
for metering, maintenance and control of the distribution system in
each district. The TWB's organization is satisfactory and has
competent and motivated staff (Chart 3). The total staff is 764
persons, or 9Z of total city staff. Staff efficiency is high - 3.7
employees per thousand water connections - which is better than in
most developing countries. Other indicators of efficiency are also
good: water connections are fully metered, meters are well maintained,
and meter maintenance shops are adequate. Collections are made through
commercial banks and branch offices. Collection procedures are tight
and ztrictly enforced, and accounts receivable at the end of each
month are just two weeks of billing.
4.10      Water supply accounts, revenues and expenses are kept
separate from the city accounts. The system of accounts for all WBs in
Korea was recent'v updated by MORA, revieved by the Bank, and is
satisfactory. Account;-& information is reliable and timely. Presently
only billing and payroll .re computerized, but under the Second Water
Supply Project computer hardware and software is being tested and
developed to computerize accounting, finances, inventories, etc., aud
to provide a Management Information System for all WBs including Taegu
City. External auditors have been submitting timely and satisfactory
audit reports. Assurances were obtained during negotiations that the
project cost accounts for the TWS and the TWB's financial statements
would continue to be independently audited, and that a copy of the
auditor's report would be sent to the Bank by July 1, six months
after the end of each fiscal year.

V. FINANCXAL ANALYSIS
A.ISWACO'S Past and Present Financial Performance
5.01    Upon completion of the project, ISWACO would own and operate
the NRS and another ten regional water supply systems. ISWACO is a
public enterprise owned by the Government (95%) and the Korea
Development Bank (5%). Its authorized capital is W 500 billion, fully
paid as of December 31, 1984. ISWACO has been groving rapidly and its
fixed assets increased almost four times between 1980 and 1983.
ISWACO's financial performance during the last five years has been
satisfactory, with positive and rapidly increasing net income
(averaging 2Z of its equity), a current ratio of 1.4, and a debtf(debt
plus equity) ratio of 50%. However, its operating ratio is higher than
92X, primarily due to the effect of the Industrial Sites Division,
which has an operating ratio of 100%. Consolidated financial
statements for ISWACO are shown in Annex 9. The construction of new
industrial sites and cities was the main activity of ISWACO some years
ago. After construction, these industrial sites, togetner with related
losa obligations,  are sold at cost. Recently, however, the Korea Land
Development Corporation (KLDC) and some cities are undertaking
industrial site development, and ISWACO's revenues and expenditures on
this operation have halved between 1979 and 1983. Given the balancing
of revenues and expenditures of the Industrial Sites Division, and its
decreasing activities, ISIWACO's future finances would mainly depend on
its two other operations, the Water and Dams Divisions. The Water
Division sells water in bulk to many municipalities (more than 60 by
1988) and industrial zones, and the Dams Division sells energy to the
Korea Electric Power Company (KEPCO) and collects water rights charges
from cities using water from rivers regulated by ISWACO. The financial
analysis for ISWACO is therefore centered on these two Divisions.
5.02      In 1984, the Water Division accounted for only 35% of
ISWACO's revenues, but its net revenues were two thirds of ISWACO's
total net revenues. The financial performance of this Division is
satisfactory (see Annex 7), and provides substantial cash
contributions for ISWACO's development investments. ISWACO's national
bulk water tariffs include a fixed charge for the basic contracted
quantity, a charge per unit of volume used, and a surcharge for volume
used in excess of the contracted quantity. The present tariffs average
H 32 per ton of raw water and W 74 per ton of treated water. The
pricing policy and the criteria to set these tariffs, including the
appropriate ratio between fixed and excess demand charges and their
specific application to the proposed NRS, are being studied under the
project (para. 1.08 a).
5.03      The Dams Division operates six dams (Andong,  Soyang,
Taechong, Nam, Seonjin and Chungju), and three additional dams and
the Nakdong Barrage are under construction. About 84% of its total
revenues are from the sale of bulk power to KEPCO. The Chungju Dam
would increase the power generated by ISWACO by 138% between 1984 and
1986. The other 16% of the Division's revenues in 1984 were from water
rights charges, collected from municipalities and industries which
use water from rivers regulated by ISWACO. Charges for these services



- 23 -
are based on the economic allocation of the cost of each dam to water,
pover, irrigation, flood control, etc., in proportion to their
respective benefits or alternative costs. ISWACO's efforts to collect
charges and recover a portion (30Z) of the cost allocated to
irrigation have not been successful. These charges are opposed by
farmers with support from the Ministry of Agriculture, which wants to
reduce the cost of food production. Nevertheless, ISWACO is planning
to increase the irrigated area paying charges (around $25 per ha per
year) from 190 ha in 1983 to 8,500 ha by 1988, but this would still
only represent a small fraction of the land irrigated from rivers
regulated by ISUACO. ISWACO's pover revenues depend largely on weather
conditions. During the 1982 drought, sales of hydro-generated pover
dropped from 988 to 614 GWh, resulting in a deficit of N 1,662 million
in this Division. The present financial position of the Division is,
however, satisfactory, as shown by its financial indicators (Annex 8,
Table 5). Cash operating expenses, including taxes, represent a low
and declining percentage (34Z) of its revenues, and most of the
Division's revenues are used for capital expenditures.
5.04     IS1ACO has made considerable efforts to comply with the rate
of return covenant under previous projects (Loans 2350-KO and 2491-
KO). The doubling of the value of its fixed assets, which were
revalued in 1984, and increased operating costs due to price increases
for pover and water rights made compliance very difficult. Between
1982 and 1984, ISWACO's power charges were increased from W13.8/Kwh to
123.7/Kvh (58% in real terms), and water rights charges were increased
from  11.9/ton to R 3.7/ton (78% in real terms). Although Government's
policy is to stabilize prices and control inflation, ISWACO's water
charges were increased 10% in January 1985, which would allow
compliance with the 4% rate of return covenant in 1985. ISWACO had to
undertake the operation of the Geumgang Regional System, where demand
is likely to remain at only a small fraction of its water production
capacity for many years. It would be inequitable to penalize water
users in other regions to compensate for the poor performance of this
system. Therefore, for purposes of the rate of return covenant, the
financial projections include the full costs of operation and
depreciation of this system, but exclude its fixed assets from the
rate base up to 1989. The power charges payable by KEPCO for Chungju
Dam are being studied by consultants. Their preliminary recommendation
of 935/Kwh would allow compliance with the rate of return covenant for
the Dams Division in 1985 and 1986. It was confirmed during
negotiations that the tariff study for Chungju power tariffs would be
completed before end of September 1985, and that the approved tariff
would be implemented by the end of 1985 and would be effective
retroactively from the start of power generation of this dam by mid-
1985.
ISWACO's Future Financial Performance
5.05    Assurances were obtained during negotiations that ISWACO's
Water and Dams Divisions would achieve a minimum rate of return on
revalued fixed assets of 5% from 1986. This rate, already included in
the Metropolitan Region Water Supply Project, provides a satisfactory
financial performance and is reasonable in view of: (a) for the Dams
Division: the lumpiness of the investments in dams, and the provision



- 24 -
of services whose costs are not fully recoverable from users (such as
charges for water taken from the rivers for irrigation and flood
control expenses); and (b) for the Water Division: the provision of
satisfactory water services to the poorest regions at a reasonable
price. This rate of return would allow ISWACO to meet operational and
and debt service expenses, and internally finance about 15% of the
large planned investments ($1,050 million) in thse Divisions between
1984 and 1988. These investments would more than double the net fixed
assets of these Divisions in 1983. Compliance with this covenant is
feasible but would require considerable efforts. For the Dams'
Division, pover charges would have to be further increased by 50% in
real terms between 1984 and 1988, and the charges for water rights
increased by 60% in real terms in the same period. For the Water
Division, tariffs would have to be adjusted by about 10% in real terms
between 1984 and 1988. ISWACO's power charges are negotiated with
KEPCO in consultation with EPB and the Ministry of Energy and its
water charges are approved by MOC in consultation with EPB.
5.06      These rates of return would be based on fully revalued
assets. In accordance with Korean law, fixed assets can be revalued
when their estimated value exceeds 252 of the book value. Assets
revaluation doubled the assets of the Dams Division in 1984. The fixed
assets of the Water Division are relatively new (the oldest was
completed in 1980), and since inflation has been low in the last few
years their formal revaluation would only be completed by end-1985.
Nonetheless, the financial projections use the estimated revalued
assets for this Division. Assurances were also obtained during
negotiations that for rate analysis, the value of ISWACO's fixed
assets would be adjusted annually until the next formal revaluation,
using 85% of the annual increase in the wholesale price index as a
proxy for the increase in value of these assets.
5.07     Under the proposed rate of return covennt (para. 5.05), the
financial position of the Dams Division would be satisfactory (Annex
8): its working ratio would average 12%, its debt service ratio would
average 1.7, and its ratio of debtl(debt plus equity) would be below
36Z. After 1988, annual investments of about $40 million would be
internally financed, an-d additional cash would be available to
contribute to the construction of the other dams planned for the
1990s. The Water Division would also have a satisfactory financial
performance (Annex 7), with its working ratio averaging 64Z, its debt
service ratio exceeding 1.8, and the ratio of debt/(debt plus equity)
being below 18%. After project completion, this Division would rapidly
accumulate cash and be able to provide a substantial internal
contribution to future water works. Financial highlights for the Water
and Dams Divisions are presented in Tables 5.1 and 5.2. Additional
investments and their financing could affect ISWACO's financial
position. Assurances were obtained during negotiations that ISWACO
would not incur any additional long-term debt without prior Bank
concurrence, unless its debt service coverage exceeds 1.3 in any
calendar year.

I Tk9M lATE IURKA  (TUB)
Past and Present Financial Performance
5.08    The TWB is a semi-autonomous bureau of Taegu City and is
responsible for the construction, operation and maintenance of water
works. It has an independent budget with autonomy over the investments
financed from its internal resources. The TWB is a well managed water
utility. Internal cash generation by the TWB financed more than 30X of
capital expenditures during the First Water Supply Project (1982-
1984), in excess of the 20Z required mnder that loan.  Although
Government set strict guidelines to contrctl inflation between 1982 and
1984, rTIB's water tariffs were increased 15X in real terms during that
period. Costs are well controlled and pernonnel expenses are only one
quarter of the total expenses. However, uxaccounted-for water, which
averaged 34Z in 1982/83, increased to 38% in 1984 due to improved
water pressures. This would be corrected through a leak detection and
network rehabilitation program being implemented with the support of
consultants (para. 2.11). The TVB's financial performance between
1982 and 1984 has beeu good: the rate of return on partially revalued
assets averaged 7.7%, the operating ratio was 75Z, the debt service
ratio exceeded 2, accounts receivable were less than 10 days, and the
ratio of debrl(debt plus equity) has been less than 50%. The TUB
accounts somewhat underestimate the real income, because of the Korean
practice of charging the revenues and expenditures for house
connections to the income statement, instead of depreciating the house
connections over their useful life. This practice is preferred because
of simplicity, and because these revenues and expenditures cancel
each other out.
5.09      Water tariffs are satisfactory. In fact, since a large
percentage of the vater works are financed by short-term (five year)
bonds, the tariffs required for financial viability are above the
long-run marginal cost. Requests for tariff increases are submitted to
MECa, and are approved within general guidelines for price increases
set by EPB. The average tariff in 1984 was W 194 ($0.24) per ton.
Water charges varied for each category. Average residential charges
are only 73% of average charges. Other users pay higher charges,
amounting to 162% of average charges for commercial and industrial
users, and 128Z for public and other users. The tariff structure is
progressive, penalizing wasteful use of water and subsidizing low
income consumers. Consumption charges for commercial or industrial
users are 2.5 to 5 times the minimum charges for low income users.
Financial highlights of the TWB are presented in Table 5.3.
Future Financial Performance
5.10     TWB's tariffs should cover operation, maintenance and debt
service, and provide substantial internal contributions to fiuance
its water works investments. This requires a rate of return on
revalued fixed assets of 8% p.a, which can be achieved by tariffs only
5% higher in real terms than the present tariff. The above rate of
return would provide a satisfactory financial position not only during
the construction period, when TWB would internally finance up to 43%
of its total investment, but also for the foreseeable future (Annex



- 27 -
10). This would also result in an average working ratio of 52X, a debt
service ratio above 1.4, and a ratio of debt/(debt plus equity) below
41%. Assurances were obtained during negotiations that starting in
1986 water charges and other operational revenues would be sufficient
to cover operation, maintenance, and depreciation and achieve a rate
of return not lower than 8%. The TWB's fixed assets were revalued
satisfactorily at the end of 1984 in accordance with Korean law.
Agreement was also reached during negotiations that for rate analysis,
the value of TWB's fixed assets would be revalued as explained in
para. 5.06.
Relortink Requirements - Honitorinx Indicators
5.11      In order to satisfactorily monitor the inrestment programs
and financial plans, assurances were obtained during negotiations
that:
(a) ISWACO would send to the Bank, not later than February 28
and August 31 of each year, a Management Information Report,
including data on water demand and revenues, and the
monitoring indicators presented in Table 5 of Annexes 7 and
8, and the status of compliance with loan covenants. The
August 31 report would also include updated five-year
projections (income, flov of funds and balance statements)
for its Water and Dams Divisions;
(b) MOC would send to the Bank not later than August 31 and
February 28 of each year, semiannual reports on the cost
(Annex 4A) and updated execution schedule of the NRS (Annex
5);
Cc)  TWB would send to the Bank, not later than August 31 and
February 28 of each year, a Management Information Report,
including the project cost (Annex 4B), the updated execution
schedule (Annex 5) and monitoring indicators (Annex 10,
Table 5), and the status of compliance with loan covenants;
and
(d)  MOC and TWB would prepare for the NRS and TWS respectively,
a Project Completion Report satisfactory to the Bank, not
later than six months after the loan closing date.

VI. PROJECr Jc
Introduction
6.01      The proposed NRS meets urgent water needs for thirteen
municipalities, including two cities and eleven towns and villages, in
Tyeongnam Province. Although the project region has considerable
economic potential, its development and population growth rates are
well below those of other regions, mainly because of the scarcity of
water. The project also includes the expansion of water services for
Taegu, the third largest city in Korea, where rapid population and
industrial growth would overextend the water supply by 1988. The
project would solve these problems and provide the water needed for
the development of both project areas.
Proiect Benefits
6.02      Upon completion of the NRS, about 140,000 persons who are
already served would be free of water rationing and low pressures. In
addition, the project would meet the groving water needs for
commercial and industrial development, and nine of the municipalities
would have a public water system for the first time. The MRS provides
only treated water in bulk to the municipalities. The two main cities
in the NRS, Samcheonpo and Chungmu, are already expanding their
distribution and house connections systems with ADB financing.
Government provided assurances that similar distributiou works would
be completed in the smaller towns by 1988 (para. 3.04).
6.03      The TWS would  improve service and reduce the unaccounted-
for water and operational expenses for the population already served
in Taegu City (about 1.9 million persons), and would serve about
400,000 additional persons by 1991 and 780,000 persons by 1995. The
TWS would provide water to unserved areas of the city and increase
coverage from 94% in 1984 to 98X by 1991, when practically everyone
would enjoy good water service in terms of quantity, quality and
reliability.
6.04      The project would also foster sector reforms through the
continuation of the sector policy dialogue (paras. 1.09 and 1.11). A
benefit of the project would be the establishment of an integrated and
more efficient system of treated water for the NRS, and its reduction
in cost by using revised demand projections. Tariff studies are under
way, under Terms of Reference agreed with the Bank, to analyze
national tariff policies and levels for bulk water, and apply the
recommended policies to the NRS. The organization of water and
sewerage services in Taegu City would also be revieved under the
project. The conclusions of this review would be applicable to other
cities, and would, when implemented result in better planning and
coordination of the investments for both services, lower government
contributions and improved sanitation and environmental conditions.



- 29 -
Poverty Ismact
6.05     The population served by house connections in the NRS would
increase from 55Z in 1983 to 75Z in 1988 and 82Z by 1991 (Annex 3A,
Table 2). The NRS vould also provide water for the first time to an
additional 120,000 persons by 1991 and 175,000 persons by 1996. Most
of the population without water, or- with a rationed supply, is of low
incoue, and the new neighborhoods to be served are predominantly low-
income. In this region, the population in relative poverty 11
averages 24Z compared to 18X for the country as a whole. It is
expected that about 65% of the urban poor in the project area (about
50,000 persons) would have house cennections by 1991, compared vich
17S now. In Taegu about 150,000 persons in relative poverty would be
served by 1991, about one third of the incremental population
benefited by the TIWS. Without the project investments, the rapid
population growth of Tae au vouid reduce the percentage of population
served to below 80% by IM91.
Least Cost Solution
6.06      The water demand and the selection of the least cost
solution was an issue during the preparation of the NBS (para. 2.04).
The alternative selected, using the existing Nangang Reservoir as the
source, is considerably less expensive than the other three
alternatives studied (Annex 11). The routes selected for the pipelines
are also the least expensive. A water treatment plant (75,000 tpd) in
the first otage would be followed by an expansion of capacity to
115,000 tpd by 1992. The proposed investments for the TYS are also
least cost, other alternatives would have been at least twice as
expensive.
Rate of Return
6.07        The Economic Rate of Return (ERR) for the project, based
on existing tariffs and the wate: benefits including increased value
of benefitting properties. is estimated at 13% for the NRS and 18% for
the TWS, with a weighted average of 16% (Table 6.1 and Annex 11).
Sensitivity analysis shows that an increase in investment costs by
10X, combined with a decrease in benefits by 10. would reduce the EN
to 13S. The optimal design horizon for the pipelines is the year 2001,
because of economies of scale. This makes the investment lumpy and
reduces the rate of returr. Because of this, and since bulk vster
tariffs are the same throughout the country, regardleass of the cost of
water production in each regional system, the Incremental Financial
Rate of Return (IFRR) for the NRS, based only on ISWACO tariffs, is
2Z. This highlights the need for the proposed tariff study (para. 1.08
(a)). The IFRR for the NRS, using retail water tariffs and the
distribution investments required to provide vater to the population,
is 6Z (Annex 11 A, Table 3). This is because present retail water
tariffs do not cover the full cost of operation, since there is
limited willingness to pay for water services which presently are
rationed, unreliable and of unsatisfactory quality. Bovever, the iRS

is the only economic water supply source available for the
municipalities in the project area and is essential for the regionts
development. For the TWS, the ERR, based on existing tariffs, is 18X.
Sensitivity analysis shows that an increase of investments by 10i
combined with a 1OX reduction in benefits reduces the ERR to 15%. The
above rates of return exclude other important benefits which are
difficult to quantify (such as the improvement of the living standards
of the population already connected, the consumer surplus, and the
health and general welfare benefits brought on by safe and reliable
water supply).

Marginal Cost
6.08     The marginal cost of bulk treated water in the NRS is W 169
per ton ($0.20 per cubic meter) assuming a discount rate of 10% (Annex
11A, Table 2). This is twice the present nationwide tariffs for
treated water. There are some valid arguments for not charging the
full marginal cost in the NRS region, mainly because of the relative
poverty and the need to promote development of the region.
Nonetheless, water charges should provide a better indication of the
cost of water. The tariff study (para. 1.08 (a)), would provide
recommendations on the level of charges to be applied to the NRS based
on economic, financial and social considerations. Since the volume of
water sold in this region would be less than 2% of the water sold by
ISWACO, the financial impact of this system on the ove-;all financial
position of ISWACO is negligible. By contrast, the TWS's marginal cost
of W 148 per ton is 26% below the present average water tariff. For
TWB, the tariffs required for financial reasons are higher than the
marginal cost because of the large percentage of short-term financing
(bonds) repayable in five years, while the useful life of the
investments is 30 or more years.
Affordability'
6.09     Present water rates are affordable both for the NRS and the
TWS consumers. For the NRS municipalities, retail water charges
represent less than 1% of the average disposable income. In the TWS,
water consumption is higher, and average water charges are about 3X of
the average income. However, water tariffs in all cities are
progressive, subsidizing low income consumers, while excessive
consumption is charged at rates 3 to 5 times the rates for minimum



- 31 -
consumption. Therefore in both subprojects, the urban poor, which
typically use less than 10 tons of water per month, pay only about
W1,300 per month, which is less than IZ of the monthly disposable
income at the poverty threshold. The effect of the tariff increases
expected during project implementation would be compensated by the
expected increases in per capita income, maintaining water readily
affordable for the whole population.
Proiect Risks
6.10    There are no special risks in the project. The izplementation
schedule is feasible based on previous project experience and the
relatively small size of works. However delays may occur, and if so
the rate of return would be lower, but nonetheless adequate. In
addition, there is the risk that the municipalities may not build the
necessary distribution works on time, delaying the project benefits.
This has not been a problem in previous projects and Government has
provided assurances that complementary works for the NRS would be
completed by December 31, 1988 (para. 3.04).

KOREA
NAMGANG AND TAEGU WATER SUPPLY PROJECT
EXISTING FACILITIES - WATER SUPPLY AND SANITATION
A. Namnang Resional System (HRS)
1.   NamRang Reservoir. The existing reservoir vas constructed in
1970 by HOC, and is presently operated by ISWACO, mainly for flood
control. It also provides for a power generation by KEPCO of 4300 kW
per hour, irrigation water for about 9,800 ha, and about 100,000 tpd
public water supply for Chiuju and Sancheonpo cities. The reservoir
has a catchment area of 2,285 sq km and a surface area of 23.55 sq km
at full supply elevation of +39.5 m. It cannot presently be operated
at this design elevation due to incomplete land acquisition, presently
completed only to elevation +38.0 m (1110 year high flood level). The
main spillway has a design capacity of 2,000 cu mlsec, but discharges
of this magnitude would result in some flooding of downstream
development in Chinju City. The supplementary gated spillway into
Sacheon Bay has a design capacity of 5,460 cu m/sec. but the
discharge channel cannot safely pass discharges of this magnitude. As
a result of these limitations ISWACO operates the reservoir so as to
avoid maximum spillway discharges and high reservoir elevation and
has, over the last 10 years, passed the maximum recorded flood (7000
cu m/sec or 1/50 year flood return frequency) with the reservoir at
about +37m elevation. The maximum design flood is 10,000 cu m/sec
(1/200 year return flood frequency).
2.    Both NOC and ISVACO have started studies to identify the best
options available to optimize reservoir operations to serve all
planned water requirements from the reservoir, including the increase
of public water supply from 100,000 tpd in 1986 to about 250,000 tpd
in 1991 and 400,000 tpd in 2001. ISWACO studies would also take into
account the reduction in water demand for irrigation after the
completion of the Nakdong Barrage and the Hapcheon Dam in 1988. These
two dams would greatly increase the water availability in th, Nakdong
River and practically eliminate the need for the Namgang Reservoir for
this purpose. ISNACO has also designed a comprehensive hydrological
data collection and flood warning system to cover all the maior
reservoirs being operated by them, including the Nangang Reservoir,
and is planning to install this system during 1986 to help improve
reservoir operations.
3.   Simulation studies indicate that with  the reservoir operated as
designed, conflicts between water availability for power generation
and public water supply would arise by the 1990's. At that time it
wculd be necessary to give public water supply priority on the use of
water from the reservoir and compensate KEPCO for loss of pover
generation. It has been estimated that this loss would amount to only
V 1.5 per ton of water supplied. WOC is also carrying out feasibility
studies aimed at augmenting the present water resources of the Namgang
Reservoir by either raising the crest level of the dam to provide for
additional storage or by providing a new storage dam at Hwamyang



-  35 -                     ANNEX I
upstream of the present reservoir. Either of these options, if
implemented, would also resolve any potential conflicts between
beneficiaries.
4.    In order zo ensure adequate vater supply for the municipalities
in the NRS it has been confirmed (para. 2.06) that (a) MOC would give
priority to public water supply in the allocation of water resources
from the Nangang Reservoir and, (b) MOC and ISWACO would complete a
program of land acquisition (about 340 ha, estimated to cost W 4.8
billion) in accordance with a schedule satisfactory to the Bank. This
would allow the operation of the reservoir at its design elevation of
39.5 m. HOC is also planning other measures to increase the water
available for the DRS. These include ISWACO's ongoing program to study
and optimize reservoir operation under the changed conditions after
1988 (when other dams would enter into operation) and the installation
of a reliable hydrological data collection and flood warning system
for the reservoir.
5.       Water SuDDly. Public water supply systems are being operated
in the two cities (Chungmu and Samcheonpo) and Sacheon and Goseong
Eups, with varying degrees of efficiency and adequacy. Gwongdo Myeon
is presently building a new system while all other myeons have
unreliable, fragmented rural water systems. Present water sources are
mainly from the shallow aquifer along the minor valleys of the region.
These sources cannot produce adequate supply during the long dry
season. The water scarcity is compounded by the water demand for
agricultural purposes. The only reliable supply is the 11,000 tPd raw
water supply allocated to Samcheonpo City from the Naugang Reservoir
through the existing raw vater pipeline jointly owned by KEPCO and the
City (Map IBRD 18965). This main has a present supply capacity of
20,000 tpd capable of expansion to 30,000 tpd. KEPCO has an allocation
of 9,000 tpd from this source for the thermal power station at
Samcheonpo and presently uses 4,000 tpd for the first two of the six
generating unit to be installed before 1991.
6.        The Chungmu City water supply system presently relies on
four water sources from infiltration galleries in the shallow acquifer
adjacent to local streams. Total d2sign capacity is 15,000 tpd, though
normal yield does not exceed 11,000 tpd, with low yields during the
prolonged dry season of as little as 2,000 tpd. Three of these sources
are outside the City boundary and belong to other municipalities,
originating major conflicts for the use of scarce water. Effective
production capacity of 11,000 tpd is available in three treatment
plants, the oldest of which was commissioned in 1944.
7.       Samcheonpn City  has two treattient plants, one of 3,000 tpd
capacity, drawing water from an infiltration gallery in the Bonghyun
River valley, and the other using the previously mentioned 11,000 tpd
raw water from the Namgang Reservoir. The first source is unreliable
and effective yield is as little as 1,500 tpd and would be abandoned
when the project is completed. The Namgang water treatment plant would
be gradually phased out by about the year 1996 when the demand for raw
water from industry is expected to absorb the full capacity of the
existing pipeline.



-  36  -                    ANUl 1
8.       Sacheon Eup draws its raw water from the Sacheon River with
a high risk of industrial and agricultural pollution. The leprosarium
located upstream of the intake also contributes to pollution of this
source. Temporary improvements are planned till the project is
completed, when the present facilities will be phased out. Goseong Eup
has a treatment plant of 2,000 tpd, but the source is unreliable and
would also be phased out on completion of the project.
9.        Water supplies are managed by the Water Bureaus in the
cities and by a water section within the CoTnstruction Bureau in the
smaller towns. The WBs are semiautonomous and have an independent
budget. Staff is limited and inexperienced.
10.       Sanitation. The four municipalities where public water
supply is available have combined waste and storm water drainage
systems serving about 35% of their area. Premises are served by septic
tanks, cesspits or pit latrines. Night soil is collected, treated and
used as fertilizer by farmers. The street drains and main water
courses which receive most of the waste vater from premises discharge
untreated wastes into the nearest river or coastal bay. Generally
anaerobic polluted conditions prevail in the main water courses
during most of the year. The small myeons have lower population
densities and less problems to dispose of waste water. The cities and
eups maintain efficient garbage and nightsoil collection services and
the standards of sanitation are satisfactory.
B. Taejm Water Sripply System (TWS)
11.      Water SuDply. The main water source for Taegu is the Nakdong
River on its western border (Map IBRD 18966R). The Nakdong drains
23,656 sq km or uearly one quarter -i the country and provides
substantial water resources for major public and industrial water
supplies as well as for extensive agricultural requirements in its
basin. The Andong Dam constructed in 1974 regulates the river above
Taegu, and the Nakdong Barrage now under construction in the estuary,
for completion by 1988, would prevent salt vater intrusion and allow
the use of water presently used to prevent saline intrusion into the
river. The Namgang Reservoir, on a downstream tributary also provides
regulated flow for downstream users, as would the Eapcheon Dam, now
under construction on another tributary. Construction is about to
start on the Imha Dam to supplement storage and river control upstream
of Taegu. The completion of the Nakdong Barrage in 1988 by itself
would assure sufficient year-round water availability in the Nakdong
at Taegu, till beyond the year 1996 which is the design horizon of
the project.
12.       Taegu City presently has a water production capacity of
720,000 tpd from the Nakdong river and can produce another 140,000 tpd
from two other local sources. It has four conventional treatment
plants, the most modern of which is the 400,000 tpd Dasa Plant,
completed in 1984 under the First Water Supply Project (Loan 2072-KO).
The distribution network consists of about 100 km of primary and 1,175
km of secondary mains from 75 mm to 2,200 mm diameter. The system
includes 20 booster pump stations and 13 service reservoirs of about
66,000 tons capacity, and has about 198,000 service connections



- 37  -                     ARNEX I
serving 922 of the population. Unaccounted-for water is reaching
almost 402. The city has started a leak detection and control program
financed under Loan 2072-R0, which would be complemented by the
rehabilitation and replacement of old pipelines financed by the
project.
13.       Taegu Water Bureau (TWB), has independent budgets and
accounts. The organization of TWB (Chart 3), includes 800 staff who
have considerable experience in management, planning, operations and
maintenance. Consultants and contractors are hired as necessary to
assist city staff in major planning and improvement works.
14.       Sanitation. The existing system consists of combined storm
and waste vater collector and main drains discharging into water
courses and ultimately into the two main rivers - the Nakdong and the
Guem Ho - draining tbe city. Premises are provided with either a
septic tank or a cess pit which drains into the nearest street drain.
The septic tanks and cess pits are desludged periodically. Night soil
is treated in special treatment plants before disposal. In December
1984, the City completed, with the assistance of consultants, a
Sewerage Master Plan which sets out priority plans and investments for
sewage collection and treatment between 1985 and 2001. The city has
started, witb OECP assistance, the construction of the first treatment
plant to serve the most densely built-up area. This 360,000 tpd
facility will be completed in 1987. The city is also planning to
construct interceptor severs in the Dalseocheon catchment as well as
in the adjoining Sincheon catchment, which are both considered a
priority. Sever tariffs amounting to 48% of the water tariffs would be
levied from July 1985 and are expected to generate about Won 12 to 15
billion annually for sewerage investments. The above developments give
room for confidence that Taegu City would embark on an adequate
investment program for improvements in sewerage services before the
project is commissioned in 1988. Garbage is collected directly by the
Cleaning Section, as well as by private contractors working for the
city, and disposed of by landfill or incineration. These services are
well operated and maintained and the level of neighborhood sanitation
is satisfactory.
15.       Table 1 summarizes the details of the existing population
served and water services in the project municipalities.
Environmental Aspects
16.      The availability of reliable, adequate and safe water supply
in the municipalities served would allow residents to improve health
and sanitation and contribute to improve the environment. The only
adverse environmental impact of the project, the increase in waste
waters due to the expansion of water supply, is being addressed by the
Master Plan mentioned above. Generally, municipalities in Korea
maintain efficient public sanitation services like garbage collection
and disposal, street cleaning, septic tank and night soil collection
and disposal and maintenance of drains and water courses. Residents
are also very conscious of the euvironment and maintain neighborhoods
and premises clean. These factors result in better environmental
conditions in urban areas than in most other developing countries.



-  38 -                     ANNEX 1
17.      The additional, assured year-round, water supply that would
be provided by the project vould alleviate some of these problems.
Government is also now giving priority to the planning and financisg
of a country-wide program to provide improved collector and
interceptor severs and treatment facilities for urban areas. The
cities themselves will start collecting, starting in 1986, severage
tariffs amounting to up 30X to 50% of their water tariffs to finance
improvements to waste water collection and disposal systems. These
improvement programs, now in the planning stage, would, when
implemented, help resolve sanitation problems. The smaller
municipalities served by this subproject have lover densities and are
situated in undeveloped agricultural areas, where lack of severage is
not critical. Sanitation and health conditions would be improved with
the availability of adequate and reliable piped water supply.
18.       Both HOHA and MOC  are preparing investment plans for
country-wide improvement of waste water collection and disposal
facilities in urban areas as part of Government's priority plans to
deal with environmental pollution problems. The availability of
adequate quantities of piped water at affordable prices would also
improve household sanitary conditions, especially in the poorer
neighborhoods. The Bank is presently discussing with both the
Government and Taegu City investment priorities in severage which may
be included in future projects.

KOREA
NANGANG AND TAEGU WATER SUPPLY PROJECT
Project Description
A. Nam River Reiional Water Supply System
1.       General. The project is located in the Southeastern Coastal
area of Kyeongnam Province aid is the first regional water supply
system for the area municipalities (Map IBRD 18965R). It serves the
two main cities in the area, Ssmcheonpo and Chungmu with 1983
populations of 64,000 and 83,000 respectively. The project is also
designed to serve two other small towns (eups) and 9 villages (myeons)
which are near the proposed water transmission pipelines.
2.        The project consists of; a raw water intake and puiping
station draving water from the existing Nangang Reservoir and sited on
the opposite bank from Chinju City; a raw water transmission pipeline
to a new treatment plant at Sacheon; a treatment plant and main
treated water pumping station at Sacheon; treated water transmission
pipelines including brr^nch lines to the municipalities served; and a
tunnel and a storage teservoir. Instrumentation for system monitoring
and control and technical assistance for project design and
supervision are also included.
3.       The main physical works are:
(a)  Raw Water Intake and Pumpinz Station. An intake tower in the
Namgang Reservoir consisting of two 1,500mm diameter, 30m long
pipes, feeding an intake well at the lower level and tvo 1.5m x
1.5m intake ports in the tower at the higher level, each intake
being equipped with stainless steel bar screens and control
sluice gates. The wet well has three zieparate compartments, with
provision for installation of two vertical pumps in each. Three
two-etzge vertical intake pumps designed to deliver 0.44 cu m/sec
at 45m total head would be installed in the first stage. The pump
floor, vertically above the wet well, would accommodate the 300
kW, 3.3 kV motors, with vertical drives, and be equipped with
overhead crane, pumping manifold and 1,100 mm diameter discharge
pipe. A control room and office, 100 kVA electrical substation
and flow meter chamber will also be provided .
(b) Raw Water Transmission. A single 1,100 mm diameter pipeline,
about 17 km long, would transmit water from the intake at an
elevation of 27.5 m to the water treatment plant at Sacheon at an
elevation of 45.1 im witb a high point at an elevation of 55.0 m.
(c) Water Treatment Plant. A treatment plant designed to handle
75,000 tpd raw water, to be expanded to 1x5,000 tpd in a second
stage by 1992. The plant would be equipped for dosing and mixing
of chemicals as required, flocculation, sedimentation, pH
correction, filtration, and chlorination. In addition, the
treatment process would include facilities for sludge thickening
and lagooning and recovery of wash waters. A lOm x 4.5m x 3.7m



-  41  -                   ANNEX 2
receiving chamber with provision for bypass, would be followed by
a chemical dosing channel and mixing chamber 3.8m x 3.8m x 3.7m
equipped with an electrically driven flash mixer. Each
flocculation chamber, 420 cu m volume, would have two
compartments arrauged in series equipped with paddle mixers. Four
horizontal flow, conventional-type clarifiers would be provided
each 47m x 12m x 4.8 m average depth. Where appropriate,
provision has been made to duplicate these facilities for a
second stage. Six rapid sand single media filters would be
provided, with provision ior extension by another four later. Two
treated water reservoirs, each  45m x 15m x 4.5m  (6,000 cu m)
vould be provided. The treatment plant would have the necessary
ancillary facilities for chemical storage, sludge lagooning and
disposal, etc., and also the necessary control and
instrumentation and laboratory facilities.
{d)   Treated Water Pumping Station. The pumping station would be
equipped to draw water from the clear wells iato its suction
well, and two banks of high service pumps would be designed to
operate on the Chungmu and Samcheonpo lines separately. On the
Chungmu line there would be three double suction 550 hp, 3.3 kV
pumps designed to discharge 0.2'1 cu i/sec to operate against a
total head of about 130 m, and has a provision for a later
installation of another two similar pumps. On the Samcheonpo line
there would be two 75kw and two 13BkW, 3.3kV pumps designed to
operate against a total head of 30m with provision for a later
installation of two additional 130kW Dumps. The station would be
protected against water hammer by accumulators and relief valves
and would be fully equipped with control and monitoring
instrumentation and maintenance facilities.
Ce)  Treated Water Transmission PiDelines. The pipeline to Ch-gtmu
would be a 900mm diameter, 24.5 km long pumping line to the upper
reservoir at Sangri and a 800mm diameter, 21.9 km loog gravity
line to Chungmu. A 540 m length of this gravity line just
downstream of the reservoir would be laid in a 2.0 i wide
horseshoe-shaped tunnel. The pipeline would be provided with the
necessary branch lines and fittings to supply water to the seven
other municipalities en route. The upper reservoir vould provide
6,000 tons storage. Tne pipeline to Sancheonpo would be a 700 mm
diameter, 14 km long pumping line with a 300 mm diameter, 7.3
km long branch line to Chuckdong. Steel pipelines will be fully
protected against corrosion.
(f)  Telemetry/Control System. The system would be provided with
reading, processing and storage equiDment for centralized
monitoring and control, using leased telephone lines for
communication. The treatment plant and the setting of the branch
distribution valves would, however, be independently controlled.
B. TaeRu City Water Supply System
4.          General.  The Taegu City Water Supply System (TWS)
subproject is a continuation of the first stage extensions financed
under the First Water Supply Project. Taegu is the third largest city



-  42  -                   ANNEX 2
in Korea, the largest in Kyeongbug Province and is situated on the
Nak.;_- River (Map IBRD 18969R). It is designed to serve Taegu City
water requirements up to the year 1995.
5.        The nev works would provide an additional 407,000 tpd
pumping capacity (including the provision for backwashing filters) at
the existing intake works on the Nakdong River, constructed under Loan
2072-KO. The Dasa Treatment Works, also constructed under this loan,
would be extended as planned to produce an additional 400,000 tpd of
treated water. A duplicate main treated water transmission pipeline
would connect to the existing city distribution network, improve
supply conditions to most areas of the city and provide sufficient
water to extend coverage to presently unserved areas. The project
would also provide for necessary improvements to the main distribution
network, additional storage reservoirs and booster pumping stations,
and for replacement of older mains to complement the leakage control
program.
6.       The main works are:
(a) Intake and Pumping Station. Purchase and installation of ten sets
of 250 hp 3.3 kV pumpsets with all associated equipment in the
existing intake pumpstation;
(b) Dasa Treatment Plant and PunRing Station. Double its present
production capacity to 800,000 tpd including chemical building,
flocculation and sedimentation tanks, rapid sand filters, treated
water reservoir, sludge disposal facilities, etc. Extersion of
the existing booster pump station by addition of three 900 kW and
seven 450 kW pumps and associated equipment.
Cc) Treated Water Transmission. A 1,800 mm diameter  pipeline 5.6 km
long (4.0 km being financed by the city).
(d) Distribution Imurovements. Additional network links, 400-900 mm
diameter and about 11 km long in aggregate, located at selected
points in the network to improve service pressures and delivery
capacity.
(e) Service Reservoirs and Booster Pump Stations. 80,000 tons of
reservoir capacity at several locations, and three small booster
pumpstations.
(f)  Network Rehabilitation.   Replacement of old pipe in the
distribution network between 150 mm and 1200 mm diameter, 40 km
long in aggregate, and the purchase of specialized leakage
detection equipment, to complement the leakage detection and
control program of the city.
7.         The project also provides for  (a) the extension and
application to the NRS of the study for bulk water tariffs for ISWACO.
Terms of Reference for this study had been agreed with ISWACO and are
available in the Project File; and (b) a review of the organization
of water and severage services in Taegu City (Terms of Reference,

KOREA
NAKGANG AND TAEGU WATER SUPPLY PROJECT
Economic Analysis
Least Cost Solution
1.        The water demand and the selection of the treated water
system for the NRS was an issue during the project preparation (paras.
2.04 and 6.04). The treated water system selected is more efficient
and economic than the raw water systems built previously. In addition
to the proposed solution the least cost analysis studied three other
alternatives, including the construction of a new dam at Daeryong,
(which has a 50% higher present value than the proposed system),
underground water (which was not satisfactory in quantity and
quality), and combinations of these two, with additional reservoirs.
The alternative selected, (the use of water from the existing Namgang
Reservoir) is the least cost solution at discount rates of 8% to 15%.
The treatment plant and pumping facilities would be constructed in two
stages. During the appraisal, several components were further scaled
down and the cost of the NRS reduced some 12Z. The Feasibility Study
analyzed the design period for the pipelines and demonstrated that the
most economic design was for the year 2001 (13 years after
completion), given their small diameter (less than 1,100 mm), the long
transmission distances and terrain difficulties.
2.       The supply of water from the Nekdong river for Taegu City is
also the least cost solution at any discount rate. This was concluded
from the Feasibility Study for the First Water Supply Project, updated
in 1984. Some of the facilities required for the proposed TIWS were
built under the First Project. After the project completion, Taegu
would have a total capacity of 1,120,000 tpd from the Nakdong river
and 140,000 tpd from other sources. The provision of additional water
for Taegu after 1995 would require the construction of additional and
expensive dams, like the proposed Daecheon Dam being planned by MOC.
Proiect Cost
3.         Detailed analysis of the personnel,  pover and other
expenditures for the NRS are presented in Annex 11A, Table 1. The
assumptions used to forecast operational expenditures are explained in
the footnotes to this table. The estimated expenditures are close to
their economic cost and shadow prices are not considered necessary.
The main cost of the NRS is the capital expenditures for the
pipelines, since their design horizon, based on economic analysis is
the year 2001.
4.        The operational expenses of the TWS are easily estimated,
since the first stage, of the same capacity as the proposed system, is
under operation. Detailed projections of operational expenses (Annex
10, Table 1), indicate that there are considerable economies of scale
in administration, accounting, personnel, etc. and the incremental
cost of operation is estimated at W65 per ton, (Annex 10, Table 5.)



- 75 -                      ANNEX 11
Incremental Financial Rate of Return
5.       The Incremeittal Financial Rate of Return (IFRR) for the NRS
based on existing tariffs for bulk, treated vater (V 82.7 per ton,
Annex IIA, Table 2), is only 2 Z. This is the result of the present
policy by ISWACO to apply the same water charges nation-vide to all
cities irrespective of the cost in each locality. This results in
apparent low rates of return for any project where the cost of water
is above the average cost. This pricing policy is being studied by
consultants (para. 1.08 (a)), and improvements could include the
implementation of marginal pricing based on the local cost of water or
water surcharges for those localities where the cost is well above the
average, as in the NRS.
6.        A better proxy for the benefits of the NRS is obtained by
considering the total cost and tariffs when providing water to the
consumers. This is presented in Annex 11, Table 2, which includes the
capital and operating expenses of bulk water, and expenses incurred by
the 13 municipalities to distribute the vater and collect revenues.
The basic assumptions are explained in the footnotes to this table.
The additional investments for distribution works are estimated from
the planned investment programs of the cities. The cost of house
connections is not included, since this cost is fully charged to the
users and balances out, but the contributions to investments
("connections fees", averaging W 60,000 for each nev connection) are
included. The quantifiable benefits include the sale of retail
treated water, (which is the bulk water sold by ISWACO less the
unaccounted-for water). This analysis also provides an apparent low
rate of return of 6 Z. Sensitivity analysis shows that the rate of
return would be 5 X if the investment is increased IOZ or the the
benefits are reduced 10%, and would be 4% if the investment is
increased 1OZ and the benefits are reduced 10%. This can be explained,
since the benefits are based on the water tariffs of Chungmu and
Samcheonpo, averaging V 230/ton in 1983, which do not cover the cost
of operation of the present system. In fact it is surprising that the
population in these cities is willing to pay su^h tariffs for water
services so deficient in quantity, quality and reliability. Therefore
the use of existing tariffs, which in any case is only a minimum
indication of the willingness to pay, does not provide a meaningful
evaluation of the project benefits.
7.      Hovever, water is the main hindrance to the development of
this region, and the highest felt need of the population. In fact
even in the two cities, less than 15% of the population can presently
use flush toilets. Some of the benefits of water supply, not measured
by the tariff revenues, can be estimated from the comparison of the
value of houses with and without public water supply. In Samcheonpo,
where the types and sizes of houses are similar, about 40% of the
pcvulation live in areas without public water supply and rely on
handpumps or wells. Water in these systems is of poor quality and its
extraction, especially during the harsh, dry Korean winter,  is
difficult. Based on data from the Samcheonpo City and the
consultants, the price of a low income house (15-20 pyongs) with
public water supply is about W 20 million, and without water supply is



- 76 -                       ANNEX 11
only W 16 million. It is difficult to assess the portions of the
difference attributable to the availability of public water supply and
to other factors, (like better location). A conservative estimate of
the additional water benefits is obtained by including 20% of this
difference in real estate values, or about V 0.8 million per new house
benefitting from the project. Using this indication of the additional
benefits resulting from water supply the rate of return for the NRS is
13%, which is a better proxy for economic rate of return of this
component (Annex ILA, Table 3).
8.        The IFRR for TWS is estimated at 18% based on existing
tariffs and the small increase (5Z in real terms) required to comply
with the financial covenant after 1985. Since water tariffs are well
above the marginal cost this rate of return is taken as a proxy for
the economic rate of return of the TWS (Annex 11B). Sensitivity
analysis indicate that this ERR would be reduced to 17% if the
investment is increased Dy 10%, and would be 16% if the benefits are
reduced 10. Even if the investment is increased 1OZ and the benefits
reduced 10% the IFRR would still be 15% (Annex llB). The additional
benefits by comparison of the price of a house with and without public
water supply are not applicable, since a house in areas without piped
water in Taegu (which would soon reach 98Z connected) is not saleable
as a house but just for the value of the land.
Harwinal Cost
9.       The marginal cost for the NRS i%q estimated at W 174 per ton
(US$0.20 per ton), Annex 11 A, Table 2. This indicates that the
economic cost of the water in this system at a 10% discount rate is
twice the present national tariff for treated water, and that the
proposed tariff study should analyze and make recommendations on this
problem.
10.       The marginal cost for TVS at 10% discount rate is W148 per
ton. Present tariffs for treated water were V200 per ton in 1984, 35Z
higher than the marginal cost. This is due to TWB financial
requirements, in particular to the present practice of financing by
internal cash generation and short term bonds about 60Z of the water
investments (pars. 1.08 (a)). After the main water investments are
completed, this high level of tariffs may be useful to contribute to
priority sewerage investments, if both services are integrated in the
future.

Assumptions for Financial Pro ections
Inf Latiozi
1.        Project cost tables assume that foreign price increases
would be 5% p.a. in 1985, 7.5Z p.a in 1986, and 8Z in 1987-88. Local
inflation in 1983 and 1984 has been only about 3Z. Government efforts
to curtail inflation are likely to hold inflation below these levels,
in which case exchange adjustments may be used on the average, to
maintain the "purchasing power parity" with international prices. The
financial projections assume that the local inflation would be about
2.5Z in 1985, 5X in 1986 and and 5.5% thereafter. The exchange rate
for 1985 is assumed at V 850 per US dollar.
Financial Proiections
2.        The project cost, demand and financial projections use
computer programs developed by the appraisal team using Lotus 1-2-3.
Only the main financial statements (Table 1 - Income, TabLe 2 -Flow of
Funds, Table 3 - Balance, Table 4 - Financial Plan and Table 5 -
Monitoring Indicators) are included in  Annexes 7, 8 and 10 for
ISWACO's Water and Dams' Divisions and Taegu Water Bureau,
respectively. Additional tables, available in the project file,
provide details of all the assumptions and intermediate results
regarding demand, fixed assets and revaluation, debt service,
operational expenses, tariffs and revenues, etc. Therefore only the
main assumptions are explained below. The financial projections were
discussed with ISWACO and the Taegu Water Bureau, and reviewed during
negotiations.
ISWACO's Water and Dams Divisions
3.        Assets Revalzation.  Korean regulations allow for the
revaluation of fixed assets vhRn their estimated value exceeds the
book value by 25% or more. Under the Second Water Supply Project,
ISWACO's Water and Dams assets had to be revalued before December 31,
1984. This was done for the Dams' Division in December 1983, doubling
the book value for this Division. Hovever for the Water Division,
where revaluation is not expected to exceed 20X (because the assets
are relatively new and inflation has been low), the assets revaluation
is expected to be completed only in 1985. The fixed assets of Taegu's
Water Bureau were revalued at the end of 1984 and incorporated in the
books as of January 1, 1985. After 1985, the appraisal financial
projections assume a revaluation of fixed assets, using 85% of the
wholesale price index increases as a proxy for the increased value.
For Chungju Dam, which would be in partial operation by June 1985,
power generation is expected to be less than half the installed
capacity. Land acquisition and some smaller complementary would be
completed in 1986. Therefore about 70% of the Chungju Dam fixed assets
are assumed to enter into operation in 1985, with the remaining
entering in 1986.



- 82 -                           ANNEX 12
4.        Taxes. ISWACO pays income and defense taxes at a rate of
about 172 of its net income before taxes. Taxes are levied on the
total operations of ISWACO, and there are allowances for accelerated
depreciation and for deduction of interest (operational and
capitalized). Therefore is very difficult to estimate the taxes in
advance, and even more to allocate them to each of ISWACO's Divisions.
This would made difficult and controversial the calculation of the
tariffs required to comply with the rate of return covenant, and
therefore taxes, which are less than 12% of the net income, have been
excluded from the rate of return calculation.
5.       Water Division. The Water Division owns and operates nine
regional systems providing water in bulk to cities or industrial
areas. These facilities are generally constructed by MOC and
transferred to ISWACO for operation and maintenance. Most of the water
(95X) is provided raw (without treatment). Detailed water demand
projections for the NRS are presented in Annex 3B. These projections
are based on government plans for the region and were revised by the
consultants during the final design. They assume that after water
supply is assured, the population and development of the region, now
lagging compared to other regions, would accelerate, and the two main
cities would achieve population growth rates of up to 4Z pa. This is
feasible because these coastal cities have a great potential for
development, and new infrastructure is being built including tourist
developments, industrial estates, and a new harbor. Road access to
the area is also being improved.
6.        The main expansion of ISWACO's bulk water supply systems
would be the Metropolitan Region Water Supply Project, providing
treated water to 25 municipalities in the Seoul Metropolitan Region
(but excluding Seoul City). This water would be provided raw to three
cities (Incheon, Bucheon and Gwangmyeong) which are buildingl a joint
treatment plant (partially financLd by ADB). ISWACO would sell treated
water (produced in another two treatment plants) to the remaining 22
municipalities. The water tariffs were raised by 10X in December
1984. The tariff includes fixed charges (for the volume of water
contracted), variable charges with the volume of water used, and
excessive consumption charges for water used above the contracted
limit. The financial targets for national water tariffs and tariff

- 83 -                            ANNEX 12
policies and rationale would be reviewed under a tariff study (SAR
para. 1.08(b)), to be completed by September 30, 1986 (terms of
reference are available in the Project File). Since the water charges
for excessive consumption are more than four times those for the water
used, the average rate fluctuates and may actually be lower when the
volume contracted increases (e.g., between 1983 and 1984).
7.       Pow-r expenses represent almost 60" of the total,  include a
fixed charges for the installed capacity, and charges per kwh used.
These expenses are expected to increase roughly in proportion to the
volume of water produced. Actual expenses would however decrease,
because charges for installed capacity would remain constant, although
a real increase in power rates of about 1% p.a. compensates for this
factor. The number of staff also remains constant until the new
projects enter into operation, and unit personnel expenses are
expected to increase 2% to 3% per year in real terms, including the
cost of retirement benefits. Details of the number of new employees
required, materials and maintenance expenses projected on the basis of
historical trends, and for increments due to the new projects are
detailed in the annexes available in the Project File. Central
administrative expenses are allocated in proportion to the staff in
each division.
8.       Debt service is mainly with ADB,  which financed the First
Metropolitan Project ($22.2 million, payable in 24 years at 7.52), as
well as the Gumi system ($4.2 million, payable in 20 years at 8.3%)
and the Geum Gang System ($24.33 million). Bank loans for the
Metropolitan Region Water Supply Project and for the proposed project
would be paid by ISWACO with the same terms and conditions as the Bank
loan, plus a 0.05% handling charge. The foreign exchange risk would be
bourne by ISWACO. The remaining cost of the NRS would be financed by
equity contributions. These are preferred by the Qcvernme=t instead of
loans, given the need by ISWACO to internally generate funds for its
large investments in dams until 1988 (para. 13). The Water Division
is expected to transfer about W60 bill5on ($71 million) to the Dams'
Division during this period. After these projects are completed,
ISWACO would be able to assume a large internal generation and debt
service for future water and dams projects.
9.       Geumranz  System. Under the new Public Enterprise Law, ISWACO
is making an effort to increase its management efficiency and
profitability. However, ISWACO has been forced to take over the
operation of a bulk treated water system built by MOC (Geumgang). The
direct operational expenses of this eystem per ton sold are more than
three times the national water tariff charged by ISWACO due mainly to
gross overestimation of demand. In anticipation of this possibility,
it was recommended, under the Metropolitan Region Water Supply
Project, that the financial Droblems created for ISWACO by this system
should be treated as a special case since the capacity of this system
is likely to remain largely underutilized for many years. For purposes
of the rate of return covenant the full operational costs and
depreciation of the system are included, but the fixed assets are
excluded from the rate base until 1989 (inclusive). Although the
capacity of this system is only 7% of the water production capacity of
ISWACO, its fixed assets (about $90 million) are almost 40Z of the



- 84 -                             ANNEX 12
revalued fixed assets of this Division.
10.         Dame Division. The Dams Division  includes the  total
operation of the dams, the costs of which are allocated to three main
purposee: (a) water rights (water for municipal and industrial use
taken from ISWACO- regulated rivers); (b) power generated by ISWACO
and sold in bulk to KEPCO; and (c) water used from ISWACO regulated
rivers for irrigation. When each dam is completed, a detailed economic
analysis is made to distribute its cost to the beneficiaries (water
rights, power, irrigation, flood control, traffic or roads, land
reclamation, etc.). The total cost is then allocated to each
comz   't, using the lower of the benefits or the alternative cost for
each     onent. The cost allocation for flood control and 702 of the
cost a..ucation for irrigation are financed by government grants, and
are not included in ISWACO's fixed assets. In practice, ISWACO has not
been able to collect revenues from the farmers (since the Ministry of
Agriculture vants to subsidize food production), and the operational
expenses for irrigation and flood control are now being charged to the
other services.
I1.       Detailed demand projections  for the sales of pover, water
rights, and irrigation water, from each dam under operation or
construction and their respective charges and tariffs are presented
in the detailed financial projections for this Division (available in
the Project File). The Chunzju Dam, financed by Loan 1666-KO, would
start partial generation by mid-1985, and by 1986 would double the
total pover presently generated by ISWACO from its other three dams
(Andong, Soyang and Daecheong). The power generated by ISWACO is
cheaper to KEPCO than its oil, gas or nuclear generation. Therefore
ISWACO's full power capacity is used as soon as it is available.
However, since KEPCO presently has surplus generating capacity, it may
try to curtail the purchase of power from ISWACO.
12.        By 1988, the operating expenses other than depreciation
would be less than 11 of the revenues of the Dams' Division. The
remaining 89% of the revenues cover depreciation (331), and the return
on capital (56X), more than half of the revenues. About 52Z of the
operating expenses are for personnel. These expenses would almost
double upon completion of the Chungju Dam. Additional provision for
staff and other expenses is included upon completion of each of the
other dams under cnnstruction: Hapcheon, the Nakdong Barrage, and
Juam, by 1988, and Imha by 1989. Main pover expenses are to pump back
water at Andong during non-peak hours, to be used for generation
during peak hours. Materials are forecasted based on the new assets
entering into operation.
13.       Flow of Funds The Dams Division would have  investments of
some $270 million in 1985, and a total investment of almost $1 billion
during 1984-88 (Annex 8, Table 4). These investments are financed by
several foreign loans  (including Bank Loans 1666-KO and 2350-KO),
three loans from OCF, several loans from the Korean Development Bank
and the Korean 0-1 Fund and go7ernment contributions. Tnese are
summarized in Annex 8, Table 2 and further details on terms and
conditions of these loans are presented in the detailed financial
projections for this division (available in the Project File). These



-85 -                            ANNEX 12
investments, loans and contributions are provided in accordance with
loans already signed or financial plans approved by the Government.
Land reclaimed under the Nakdong Barrage would be sold between 1987
and 1989, and would largely improve the cash flow of this Division.
HOC is doing feasibility studies for the construction of another five
dams. Bovever, no priorities or schedules have been approved, and
detailed cost estimates are not available. ISWACO is now looking very
critically at these new projects, requiring them to have a rate of
return of at least 10Z if they are to be financed by ISWACO. Tentative
investments of W20 billion pa., fully internally generated, have been
included between 1989 and 1991 to provide for some of these project-.
14.       Accounts receivable are about one month of the am- -nt
billed. Other fixed assets include those which are not included iL the
rate of return (para. 9). Accounts payable to contractors represent
about month of the annual capital expenditures.
Taexu City Water Bureau
15.       Assets Revaluation. TWB's fixed assets were revalued in
accordance with the Korean law on January 1, 1985. For the financial
projections, and to avoid apparent variations in the rate of return
performance, this revaluation was applied from December 31, 1984.
Assets are revalued thereafter using the same procedures as for ISWACO
(para. 3).
16.       Water Demand. Water production per capita increased 6.7%
p.a. in Korea during the last 13 years. Even under rationed supply,
the per capita consumption in Taegu increased 4.2% pa. during the
last seven years. The per capita income in Korea has been increasing
at almost 6% per year, and this trend is assumed to continue in the
future. Because of income elasticity of water and rapid industrial
development the per capita water demand is likely to increase by about
3.5Z p.a. for the next few years. However the consultants' CKECC) and
the city's projections assume a much faster growth (5.5Z pa. between
1984-91), which is not considered realistic by the appraisal mission.
Presently the consultants have reviewed and reduced their estimation

- 86 -                           ANNEX 12
of the water demand. For the appraisal, the mission used the revised
KECC estimates of per capita demand, but delayed by one year (the
forecasted per capita consumption for a given year is applied to the
following year). Table 2 gives details of the different demand
projections
17.      Operational ExDenses. Detailed information on the projection
of TWB's expenses and debt service is available in the Project File.
This includes a detailed forecast of number of employees by category,
power expenses, the cost of house connections (called construction
consigned in Korea), and materials and maintenance expenses which
represent almost 90% of the total expenses. The cost of house
connections is fully paid by consumers. Although these expenses could
be capitalized, included in the fixed assets an. amortized, the
Korean practice is to balance out the cost and revenues for this item
in each year. This is simpler, but more conservative, and reduces the
reported net income and rate of return.
18.      The City is eager to start the construction of a treatment
plant and transmission facilities to use water from the next water
source (the Daecheon Dam), whose construction would be started by MOC.
However, the appraisal demand estimates indicate that the Geumho
Treatnent Plant, which would use water from this dam, would not be
needed until at least 1992 (although this treatment plant could
reinforce the supply to the eastern part of the city, which is at the
farthest distance away from the Nakdong river treatment plants). The
financial projections show that unless the start of construction ef
this treatment plant is postponed until 1988, TWB would have
significant cash deficits. Therefore agreement has been reached to
postpone these works and scale down some of the other investments
proposed by TWb.
19.      Financing Plan.  The overall financing plan (Annex 10, Table
4) includes the proposed Bank loan on standard conditions plus a 0.05%
handling charge. Government loans would finance W9,440 million. These
loans are provided through MOC's budget, and are repayable to KDB at
10% interest, with a 15 year term after 5 years grace. Disbursements
in each year are considered a separate loan and amortized separately.
Interest is not financed but paid at the end of each year.
20.       Bonds are expected to finance W18,401 million, including
interest accumulated until redemption. Bonds are compulsory and are
linked to house sales, construction contracts, licenses, etc. This is
based on the national policy established by HORA and widely used by
all cities to finance water works. These bonds bear interest rates of
6%, and capital and accumulated interest are paid after five years.

ROREA
NAMGANG AND TAEGU WATER SUPPLY PROJECT
Review of the OrRanization of the Water and Sewerage Services inTaeRu
City: Obiectives and Scope of Work
Int-roduction
1.       Taegu City presently operates its water services through an
independently managed Water Bureau under a Director General reporting
directly to the Vice Mayor and Mayor. The Water Bureau has separate
budgets and maintains independent accounts of revenues and
expenditures. It is fully responsible for its total operations,
including management, finance, budgeting, accounting, planning,
design, operations and maintenance.
2.     The city's sewerage services are, on the other hand, the
responsibility of a Sewerage Division within the Construction Bureau,
under a Director reporting to the Director General of Construction. It
is mainly responsible for the maintenance and expansion of the city's
drainage systems consisting of street drains, main drains, natural
water courses, drainage pumping stations, and flood protection works.
It also has some responsibilities like river maintenance and flood
relief works. It presently has no revenues of its own aud is funded
from the city's General Accounts, for both recurrent and capital
expenditures within the annual allocations available to the
Construction Bureau. However, the city will start levying sever
tariffs from July 1985 which are expected to finance operations and
maintenance as well as a portion of the severage works as recommended
in the Master Plan for Severage (1985-2001), completed in 1984. The
city is already implementing the initial works under the Master Plan,
and the Dalseocheon Treatment Plant would be completed and start
operations in 1987. Other investments are being actively planned for
the next fev years.
3.    As a result of the above improvements the Sewerage Division
would have to be reorganized soon to take care of the following
activities: revenue collection, accounts, budgeting its own revenues
starting in July 1985, etc., and starting in 1987, to operate and
maintain the Dalseocheon Treatment Plant and the new sever
interceptors. Additional staff is likely to be needed as well as
changes in the existing organization. Bovever, no study has been made
to identify and assess these needs and the feasibility of making
changes.
4.       Major cities in countries all over the world have found that
is more efficient and economic to organize their water and sec2rage
services under a unified management. This applies to cities where
water and severage services are managed by public corporations as well
as those where these services are part of the city's bureaus. In
Korea, the Seoul Metropolitan Government has already successfully
implemented the integrated management of its water and severage
services under a Director General of one Water and Severage Bureau and
is undertaking an extremely large investment program in both water nmd



- 88 -
ANNEX 13
severage facilities.
5.    The integrated management of these closely related services
includes the following advantages: better use of staff since
accounting, revenue collection, public relations, etc. can be handled
by the same staff; integrated planning of the expansion of both water
and severage services; and coordination of construction planning for
laying of water and sewerage pipelines, etc., to avoid unnecessary
disruptions on roads and problems due to lack of the other service. An
additional and even more importart benefit is that the common
management of these two services would result in the best use of
financial resource for the planned expansion of both services. At
any given time, while priority problems for one of the services may
have been solved, and this service may have surplus cash or be
investing in lower priority works, high priority works for the other
service cannot be undertaken because of lack of funds. On the other
hand, arguments can also be made for a separate and independently
managed Sewerage Bureau, which could give its full attention to this
service, but with a mechanism for close coordination of its planning
and investments with the Water Bureau.
6.    In the above context and in view of the significant expansions
of both water and severage services under the city's Master Plans, it
is important to review the organization of the water and sewerage
services of Taegu City. The reviev would analyze all relevant factors
specific to Taegu City and make proposals to improve the organization,
coordination and staffing of water and severage services.
G'biectives of the Review
7.     The  main objective is to analyze the present organization of
the  water and  sewerage  services   in Taegu  City and make
recommendations for the institutional improvements which may be need-d
for the management of these two closely related services to:
(a)  promote the optimal integrated planning and investments and
ensure their complementary development;
(b)  promote the design of efficient tariffs and more efficient use of
the staff by sharing the accoanting, billing and collection of
revenues;
(c)  promote the efficient utilization of staff, equipment, and
financial resources, for construction, operation and maintenance
and;
(d) allow for the transfer of surplus resources between the two
services and their optimal investment planning.
Scope of Work
8.     The review would use specialists experienced in institutional
development, local government organization, technical and financial
management of public utilities and legal aspects to carry out the
folloving tasks:



-89 -                       ANNEX 13
In Phase 1:
(a) Examine i.n detail the present organization structure and staffing
for managing the Water Bureau a8n4 the Sewerage Division and the
distribution in the future of the severage-related functions
within the city organization;
(b) Review the advantages and disadvantages of the present
organizational arrangements in relation to the ongoing and
proposed expansions in both services over the next ten years;
(c)  Review  the advautages  and  disadvantages  of alternate
organizational arrangements, to promote efficiency as outlined in
the objectives of this review, in particular the joint management
of the water and sewerage-related services under a single Bureau;
and
(d) Make a detailed analysis of the legal, administrative, financial,
technical and other changes that would be necessary to implement
each of the alternative organizational arrangements that are
studied, and examine the practical implications of such changes.
In Phase 2:
(e) The review would propose an organizational structure that would
be consistent with the above objectives and practical to
implement, aud propose implementation guidelines, in particular
the required number and  organization of staff.
Reporting Re-quirements
9.       The  review would be made by MORA in cooperation  with the
City Administration and the Directors General of the relevant
bureaus. The initial part of the review, estimated to last about 6
months, and encompassing work detailed in paras. 8 (a) - (d) above,
would produce a preliminary report including the analysis of the
advantages and disadvantages of each alternative and the best option
or options identified. After consideration by the City and relevant
Government Ministries and a decision as to the preferred alternative,
the Phase 2 of the review would study the implementation requirements
for the preferred option as envisaged in para. 8 (e) above. This
second phase would take about three months and would provide a report
including final recommendations, implementing guidelines and any other
relevant material.
