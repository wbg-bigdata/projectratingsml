MEMORANDUM AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT
OF THE INTERNATIONAL DEVELOPMENT ASSOCIATION
TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS
ON A PROPOSED CREDIT
TO THE KINGDOM OF NEPAL
FOR A ShJNSART M      HRN      ADWOR   PROJRCTr
The following memorandum and recommendation on a proposed Development
Credit to the Kingdom of Nepal for SDR 19.0 million (US$28.0 million equivalent)
is submitted for approval.  The proposed credit would be on standard IDA terms
with a maturity of 40 years, to help finance the completion of the ongoing
Sunsari Morang Irrigation II Project (SMIP  I)Y - Credit 1814-NEP.
ProjmE-t flAsnript1nn and Object{vas
1.    The project would provide new headworks facilities for the Sunsari Morang
Irrigation Project, initiated by the Government of India (GOI) under the Kosi
Agtreement of 1954.  The project commands an area of about 68,000 ha, of which
about 58,000 ha are effectively irrigable. Problems with siltation began soon
after the project was completed, and have defied small-scale remedial works. Two
previous credits (Cr. 812-NEP, US$30 million and Cr. 1814-NEP, US$40 million),
which provided for desilting facilities as well as development of the
distribution system, failed to address the technical difficulties with
sufficiently radical solutions and siltation has caused the loss of function of a
significant part of the completed works. The search for the correct technical
solution to the siltation problem has been actively supported by the Bank, but
has proved extremely lengthy and difficult. Finally, an international Panel of
Experts (POE) was convened and this project would implement their recommendations
which include moving the intake structure 1,300 m upstream into the Chatra Gorge,
and providing a very large desilting basin. The new site of the intake would
allow easy extraction of water, and the desilting basin would permit desilting of
the extracted water.
Project Annkground
2.    Background and Early levalo ment.  Under the Kosi Project Agreement of 1954
between GOI and His Majesty's Government of Nepal (HMGN), GO undertook to
finance and construct the Chatra Canal Project (CCP) in Nepal to irrigate an area
of about 58,000 ha using water diverted from the left bank of the Kosi River
about 20 km upstream of the Kosi Barrage at the Indian border.  Construction of
the system started in 1964, and after trial operations between 1970 and 1975, the
project works were handed over to HMGN in 1975. The project was later renamed
the Sunsari Morang Irrigation Project (SMIP). The intake and head reach of the
Chatra Main Canal (CMC) were designed for a capacity of 45.30 m3/s, equivalent to
about 0.66 1/s/ha over the original command area.  The distribution system was
terminated at turnouts serving an area of 100-200 ha. Because no minor canals
were built below this level, the system could not irrigate the whole command
area.   Siltation problems troubled the project from its inception, and these
problems became progressively worse over the years as the river migrated
1J The acronyms used for the various stages are:
SNIP:    The whole irrigable area commanded by the Chatra main Canal, about 58,000 ha.
SMIP I:  Stage I development, about 9,750 ha (Cr. 812-NEP, USS30.00 million, 1978,
project cost US$41.90 million).
SNIP II:  Stage II development, about 16,700 ha (Cr. 1814-NEP, US$40.00 million, project
estimated cost US$50.00 million).
SNIP III The unimproved balance of about 31,550 ha which will benefit partially from
SNHP.

westward. As a result of these deficiencies, the project as originally built did
not fulfill its objectives and HMGN requested IDA assistance to overcome the
shortcomings of the original project.  IDA involvement in the project has been
divided into two stages: Stage I (9,750 ha) and Stage II (16,700 ha).
3.    Sunmari Morang Irrigation andt nrainage I Projant -  (:x  A12-ISIP, UsR50.0
mdillion. 17ra. In 1978, IDA approved this project (SMIP I), which was designed
to rehabilitate and improve the irrigation and drainage system on the command
area of the CXC. The physical works included: (a) arrangements for river control
and flood protection along the Kosi River in the vicinity of the CMC intake;
(b) sediment control arrangements on the canal system and restoration,
improvement and expansion of the existing canal system; (c) design and
construction of minor distribution systems extending to outlets each serving 10
ha on 18,000 ha: (d) drainage improvements for 15,000 ha; (e) a pilot tubevall
irrigation scheme: and (f) pilot hydroelectric schemes.  Implementation of the
project was delayed, mainly because of procurement problems.   In 1983, the
project was modified to provide an improved irrigation and drainage system for
about 12,000 ha. The original proposal to provide a desilting basin with dredger
at the head reach of the CMC was postponed in favor of a supposedly cheaper
maintenance solution, and the pilot hydroelectric schemes were deleted from the
project. The area of 12,000 ha intended for improvement was reduced to 9,750 ha
because about 1,400 ha of very sandy soils within the area were found unsuitable
for surface irrigation; and, a local contractor, who was awarded the works on 850
ha, failed to perform.
4.    SMIP I, now called Stage I, was completed in 1985, but the steps taken to
deal with the siltation problem were not effective, and increasing siltation
prevented the full benefits from being obtained.  Moreover, the distribution
system design was too complex, attempting to provide demand-based irrigation to
very small groups of farmers. The siltation problem, and the complexity of the
distribut'.on network, made the system impossible to operate as designed.
S.   sungari Morang Irrigation II Project - tCr.  8l4-NREP, USS40.0 millio,.
li8.Il. In 1987, IDA processed a second project (SMIP II, Stage II), which
provided for the rehabilitation of 16,700 ha of the command area and facilities
to eliminate the siltation problem. The physical works included:
(a) improvements to the main canal; (b) improvements in the desilting operation;
(c) rehabilitation and improvement of irrigation distribution and drainage works
in 16,700 ha in the Stage II area; (d) improvement of the irrigation and drainage
system in the Stage I area (9,750 ha); Ce) construction of buildings for offices
and staff quarters, and also the provision for (i) purchase of equipment and
vehicles for O&N (including spares) and (ii) radio communication for the canal
system operation; (f) expatriate technical assistance, training, monitoring and
evaluation and studies: and (g) support for incremental project establishment and
maintenance costs.
6.    The rehabilitation of the command area has proceeded on schedule and about
40% of the distribution system has been completed.   However, the siltation
problem, exacerbated by the continued westward migration of the Kosi River, has
proved extr emly difficult to solve technically, and HNGK obtained the advice of
an international Panel of Experts, which recommended the following modifications
to the Stage 1I concept: (a) moving the intake 1,300 m upstream, (b) constructing
a larger capacity desilting basin, (c) utilizing larger capacity dredgers, and
(d) constructing a microhydro unit to provide power for the dredger operations.
7.   Although the silt ingestion was the major problem in Stage I, difficulties
were also experienced with the over-complex irrigation system adopted.   The
design of the Stage II distribution network has been modified in light of the
Stage I experience and a simplified design is now being implemented with
construction for 7,000 ha completed in June 1992. Until the increasing levels of



-3-
silt inhibited operation, this simplified system proved effective and easy to
operate and shows that once the silt problem is solved, the project will yield
the benefits projected at the time of appraisal.
FndaMentals of tha Siltatinrn Problem
8.    The siltation problem has two components: (a) extraction of water from the
river: and (b) removal of the silt from the water, once it is in the head of the
canal. During the wet season, water is easy to extract, but it is silt laden;
during the dry season, water is difficult to extract, but it is silt free.
9.    Extraction  of Wate-a    The existing intake structure was sited on the
outside of a slight bend of the original river channel, which is the classically
correct arrangement. However the detailed design, together with the main channel
migration, has resulted in the site now being marooned in a minor branch of the
main river. The resulting configuration unfortunately encourages the ingestion
of bed and suspended material and acts as a surface trash trap, both of which
cause serious operational problems. The main difficulty arises in the dry season
when the river falls and the shoals of boulders, cobbles and sand which have been
dropped in front of the intake must be removed to allow water to pass for the dry
season irrigatio . It is important to provide the first irrigation on time for
the dry season crop because this produces the majority of the incremental
benefits. To overcome the extraction problem, the POE has recommended re-siting
the intakes in the Chatra Gorge about 1,300 m upstream of the present location
where direct access to the river can be assured.
10.   Desilting Extracted Water.  Silt is carried in the river in two ways, bed
load and wash load. The bed load rolls and skids along close to the bed and can
be largely excluded by correct intake design.   The wash load is distributed
through the section by turbulence and can only be removed by a settling process
in a settling basin which reduces the turbulence. From the settling basin the
silt has to be either mechanically removed or sluiced by gravity if enough head
is available. For Sunsari Morang, there is not enough head available for gravity
sluicing, thus mechanical dredging, as recommended by the POE, has to be adopted.
11.   Ouantity of Silt.  The quantity of silt to be handled has been analyzedl/
and the desilting basin has been designed to trap both coarse and fine silt. In
an average year about 370,000 m3 would be trapped and removed by dredging. In a
high flood year the quantity would be in the order of 500,000 i3. However, the
quantity of silt can be reduced by judicious operation of the intake gates, and
the new headworks would be provided with gates which are easy to operate and
which can be closed during the short periods of very high silt load in the river.
12.   PropRoed Solution.  When it became clear that the entire Sunsari Morang
*       command area (58,000 ha) would fail unless the ever-worsening siltation problem
*       was solved, IDA actively assisted and supported the efforts of HMGN to find an
effective solution.   from a number of options, two possible approaches were
considered in detail: (a) provide facilities for dealing with the extraction and
siltation problem, or (b) abandon the surface water distribution system and use
groundwater. After the technology for solving the surface supply problem was
developed by the POE, a study of the groundwater option showed that the rates of
return from a groundwater project would be significantly lower than from
completing the surface system with adequate desilting facilities. The rates of
return achieved in two recently completed groundwater projects and estimated for
one ongoing project are:  Bhairawa Lumbini Stage I - 10% (PCR); Bhairawa Lumbini
Stage IT - 15% (PCR); and Bhairawa Lumbini Stage III - 18% (SAR).
lU Details are on Technical Annex 1 (Siltation), in the Project File.

13.   The works proposed for the surface system can be completed in three years;
and if correctly planned, the installation would provide most of the required
water supply, both in quality and quantity, after the first two years. Most of
the 58,000 ha command area is still receiving some irrigation water, and can
benefit almost immediately.

14.   SMIP is the largest surface irrigation project in Nepal and would be
successful it a sound technical, financial and management base were provided.
The technical solutions proposed for the silt problem are certain to be
successful; they have been proved in numerous projects throughout the world,
including many projects in developing countries. There is unlimited water, the
soils are good and the farmers competent.   The water management problems have
been greatly reduced by the adoption of simple structured irrigation layouts.
15.   Support of this project is consistent with HMGN's irrigation development
strategy, which gives priority to improving the performance of existing systems.
The technical solutions to be implemented would have widespread use throughout
the larger irrigation schemes in Nepal.

16.   The project would be implemented over a five-year period and would have the
following main construction components: (a) a new intake in the Chatra Gorge
about 1,300 m upstream of the present intake; (b) a culvert to carry the supply
from the new intake to a new pre-settling basin; (c) a new pre-settling basin
immediately upstream of the existing intake; (d) modification to the existing
intake to make it hydraulically more efficient, together with a lead channel to
the enlarged desilting basin; te) an enlarged desilting basin about 990 mn long
and 70 m wide; (f) dredge facilities for removing silt from the basin; (g) a
microhydro plant to provide energy for the dredge equipment; (h)  technical
assistance including training and consultancy services; and (i) hydrological
equipmex't. In addition, support would be provided for operating the dredging
equipment ror two years after installation.
Project Cost MEtimates
17.  Tha Project Costs. summarized in Schedule A are estimated at US$29.68
million, including price and physical contingencies, but excluding tax and duties
from which foreign funded projects are exempt. The cost estimates are based on
tendered rates established in 1992.2/
18.   The foreign exchange component would be US$27.00 million or about 91% of
the total project costs. Physical contingencies have been included at 10-15% of
the base cost for civil works and equipment depending on the perceived risks
involved.   Price contingencies have been added at 3.90% annually for foreign
expenditures, and at 10, 7, 7, 6 and 6% annually for local expenditures, for the
years 1993 to 1997.
19,   Naintenance Costs for the new headworks are estimated at NRs 6.30 million
per annum. Other recurrent costs for the main canal are expected to be about NRS
11 million per annum. At full development of the 58,000 ha, the total annual
recurrent headworks and main canal costs would therefore be about NRs 17.30
million or NRS 298 per ha.  The direct operation and maintenance (O&M) cost of

-5-
the distribution system would be about NRs 220 per ha, making a recurrent annual
total OM cost of NRs 520 per ha.
RLUA=±n
20.   The proposed IDA Credit of US$28.00 million would finance the entire
foreign exchange component and about 37% of the local costs of the project. The
balance of the capital expenditure would be met by HMGN from its development
budget, while the current expenditure would be financed under HMGN's annual
budgets. The Credit would be made on standard IDA terms. HMGN has agreed to
provide resources and funds to execute the project in accordance with the agreed
technical requirements, implementation program (schedule E) and expenditure
schedules.   Retroactive financing would not be required because funds are
available under Cr. 1814-N$P for the ongoing works.
21.   Procurement for the project works (US$20.17 million, Schedule B) would be
mainly by international competitive bidding (ICB), US$17.51 million, (about 87%
of all works), with some minor works items being procured under local competitive
bidding (LCB), tJS$2.31 million. Both procedures are acceptable to IDA. A small
amount of force account works (US$0.35 million) would also be allowed. The main
civil works contract would be in one package estimated to cost
US$17.51 million il, and would include the intake structure, conveyance culvert,
pre-settling basin, modifications to the old intake and channel to the desilting
basin, the desilting basin, microhydro civil works and all the ancillary works
for the headworks complex.
22. Procurement for goods (equipment and machinery) totals US$7.68 million Zf,
of which US$7.12 million (93%) would be procured under ICS procedures acceptable
to IDA. Vehicles, miscellaneous tools and minor equipment, estimated to cost
US$0.56 million, would be procured under LCB procedures acceptable to IDA. The
consultancy services for supervision, to be funded out of the project, would cost
US$1.50  million.3'        The consultants  for both the detailed design and
construction supervision have already been engaged under Cr. 1814-NEP. The costs
of studies and training are estimated at US$0.10 million. This component would
include training for the dredging equipment operation.
23.   Contract  Review.   All  contracts  for consultant  services,  technical
assistance and training and all contracts for civil works and goods above
US$100,000 equivalent would be subject to prior IDA review. This would account
for more than 95% of the procurement. Standard IDA procurement preferences would
be given to domestic contractors and domestic manufacturers in the evaluation of
bids when ICB procedures are used.
24. Disbursements (Schedule B) under the Credit would be for: (a) 90% of
expenditures on civil works; (b) 100% of foreign expenditures, 100% of local
expenditures (ex-factory cost) and 70% of local expenditures for other item.
procured locally; (c) 100% of expenditures for consultants, studies, and
training; and (d) 100% of expenditures for dredge operation service contracts.
In addition to US$2.50 million to be provided from SNIP II (Cr. 1814-NEP).
2/ In addition to US$3.00 million to be provided from SMIP II (Cr. 1814-NEP).
3V In addition to US$0.50 million to be provided from SMIP II (Cr. 1814-NEP).

25.   Itemized Statements of Expenditures (SOEs) would be used for contracts
costing less than US$100,000 for goods and civil works, including force account,
and all establishment and O&M costs. Documentation supporting these SOEs would
be retained by the implementing agency for review by IDA missions. All other
expenditures would be fully documented.
26.   A Special Account (SA) would be established at the Nepal Rashtra Bank to
facilitate payment of small expenditures. This account would be maintained in
US dollars with an authorized allocation of US$500,000.  The account would be
usod for both local and foreign expenditures of less than US$50,000 equivalent
under all categories. All other expenditures above US$50,000 equivalent would be
submitted directly to IDA for payment.
27.   The estimated schedule of expenditures, disbursement schedule, and proposed
allocation for the IDA Credit are given in Schedule B.  The expected rate of
disbursement follQws the program included in the ICB contracts. Disbursement is
expected to be completed by December 31, 1997.
Accounts and Audits
28.   The Department of Irrigation (DOI) and the Sunsari Morang Irrigation
Development Board (SMIDB) would: (a) maintain separate records and accounts for
all project expenditures in accordance with sound accounting principles;
(b) furnish to IDA a report on the SA, audited by an independent auditor
acceptable to IDA, in accordance with sound accounting principles; (c) forward to
IDA the statement of overall project accounts, together with the auditor's
reports within 12 months after the end of each fiscal year; and (d) include in
the annual audit reports, submitted to IDA, a separate opinion from the auditor
as to whether the disbursements made on the basis of the SOEs were for goods and
services received and incurred for the purposes of the project.
Proac't ImplAmentation
29.   Status of Preparation.  Detailed designs have been completed and contract
bids received for all the major works. Consultancy services contracts have been
awarded under the existing Cr. 1814-NEP. The implementing agency would be the
Sunsari Morang Irrigation Development Board, which has demonstrated capability to
execute similar works under the previous projects.
30.   Revised Implementation Schedule.   Construction work would be completed
within three years of credit effectiveness (Schedule E).  The implementation
schedule has been prepared to ensure early and effective use of the investments.
The headworks construction would be spread over three seasons, and the partially
completed works would be utilized as soon as each phase is ready. The dredgers
would run initially under grid power until the microhydro unit is ready.
Progressive relief from siltation would be achieved after the first year's
construction work is completed.
Ssta4nabi 1ity
31.   SMIDB has demonstrated its capability to keep the project operating through
very difficult periods, and to undertake minor civil maintenance works. Also,
procurement of the main civil works package under the ongoing SMIP II has been
handled satisfactorily and no major procurement problems are anticipated.
However, there were weaknesses in the areas of water management, irrigation
agronomy and mechanical operations.   These weaknesses have been addressed by
appointing a senior water management engineer and senior irrigation agronomist to
the project staff.   DOt has been unable to appoint qualified mechanical
engineering staff, as there is a national shortage of mechanical engineers.
Agreement has therefore been reached that mechanical expertise, particularly for



-7-
the initial O&M of the dredging equipment, would be retained through the
engagement of either local or foreign consultants.
Tnntitut6anal IaresU
32.   To support  SMIDB in planning,  design and construction  supervision,
consultancy services ere included in the project design.   SMIDBI's water
management team would be strengthened with a senior water management expert, and
full use would be made of the maintenance management programs being developed
under the Irrigation Sector Support Programs.  SMIDB is developing specialized
0&M sections to assume O&M responsibility as the system is completed. To ease
the burden of O0M costs, maintenance and operation below the minor canal level
would be gradually transferred to farmers through their Water Users' Groups
(WUGs). For successful management of SMIP in the future, a greater degree of
delegation of authority to SMIDB is desirable.  In addition, the farmers will
have to be deeply involved in all management decisions.   Accordingly,  the
following agreements have been reached with HMGN:
(a) A management plan will be submitted to IDA, which would include
delegation of authority to the General Manager to implement the project
in accordance with the policy directions of SMIDB.  The plan would
state the contract value up to which the General Manager has approval
authority; delegate the operation of the SA (with appropriate audit
safeguards) to the General Manager, and other measures which would
ensure the smooth implementation of the project.  After taking into
account any comments from IDA, the plan would be implemented by June
30, 1993.
(b) Commencing with the rabi season 1992/93, the Borrower will submit to
IDA an interim plan of water management for the completed part of the
SMIP II area. By March 31, 1993 the Borrower will submit an overall
plan for the water management of the entire SMIP (58,000 ha). After
taking into account comments from IDA, the Borrower will implement the
overall plan each season, commencing with the kharif season, 1993.
(c) A senior water management expert and a senior agriculturalist,
acceptable to IDA, will be maintained on the staff of SMIDB.
{d) By December 31, 1993 HMGN shall establish a consultative committee of
representatives of the beneficiaries to advise the Project Manager on
irrigation, and subsequently include as members of SMIDB at least one
elected farmer representative from Sunsari district and at least one
from Morang district.
(e) By December 31, 1993 HMGM shall submit to IDA a plan for the gradual
transfer of O&M within the minor system to WUGs, and after discussing
the plan with IDA begin implementing the plan as soon as a reliable

33.   .nnolmin Vability.t/.  The economic viability of the proposed project has
been tested as a stand-alone project with various assumptions of sunk cost. The
project is economically viable, bringing benefits to some 58,000 ha of land.
Without the project, the viability of previous investments in Stage I (SM¢P I)
and Stage II (SMIP It) are brought into question. An economic analysis of the
project shows Economic Rates of Return (ERR) between 14% and 49%, depending upon
whether the headworks are treated as a self-contained project or whether it is
1. Details are on Technical Annex 4 (Economics), in the Project File.

consideOed to be a time-slice of a larger Sunsari Morang Irrigation Project,
which includes SNIP S, SNIP II, plus a further project in Stage III of the system
(SMIP 1I1)1/. Costs and benefit streams were developed for all components and
then selectively introduced into the analysis. The ERR results are summarized
below:
(a) Whole Project (SMIP It SMIP IX, SMHP, SMIP III): ERR 14%
(b) Without Stage III lSMIP I, SMIP II, SNHP):        ERR 15%
(c) With Stage I as a sunk cost
(SMIP II, SMHP, SMIP III}:                        ERR 20%
4d) With Stage I as a sunk cost and Stage III
excluded (SMIP II, SMHP):                         ERR 22%
(e) Wlth Stage I and Stage II treated as a sunk cost
(SNHP, SNIP III}:                                 ERR 32%
(f) With Stage I and Stage IS as sunk Cost,
and Stage III not included (SMHP);                ERR 49%
34.   Options  (d) and  (f) above are consistent with past Bank practice in
economic analysis.  Approach (d) treats SMHP as the completion of the investment
started under SMIP II and, in fact, partially funded under that project
(dredgers, settling basin, etc.), and it analyzes SNIP II and SMHP together. If
this approach is taken, an ERR of 22% is projected.
35.   Option (f) treats SMHP as a stand-alone project which yields an ERR of 49%.
This is high, but hardly surprising, because SMHP finally allows Stage I and
Stage II to get an adequate supply of water and gain the benefits predicted for
the irrigation system.   It therefore benefits from the US$100.0 million
investment already made or in progress under Stages I and II.
36.  It is clear that, in every case, the inclusion of Stage III lowers the ERR.
This is a direct result of the shape in time of the stream of net benefits of the
whole project. However, since the contribution of Stage III to the net present
value is positive, there is no implication that Stage III should not be
iuplemented.  In terms of the ERR criterion, since the ERR of the entire project
and the ERR of Stage III are both higher than the opportunity cost of capital,
the project is clearly economically justifiable in its entirety.
37.   Sensitivity Analy is.  The ERR of 49% for the SNHP indicates that it would
stand large reductions in benefits, or cost increases beyond any probable level,
without reaching switching values at a discount rate of 10%. Switching values at
10% are: (a) benefit reduction of 60%; (b) cost increase of 400%; and
(c) reduction in benefits of 50% plus an increase in costs of 200%.
38.  Cost Reoverig.  The total o&M costs at the full development of 58,000 ha
would be about NRs 520/ha per annum at estimated 1992 prices.   The present
Government charge for surface water projects is NRs 200/ha per aftnum, of which
only about 25% is being recovered at this time in the Sunsari Morang area. The
unreliability of the water supply and the damage caused by the ingestion of silt
have prevented the Government from pursuing the enforcement of water charges.
39.   About NRs 220 per ha of the estimated O&M costs are in connection with the
maintenance of the distribution system. The irrigation system is divided into
minor blocks, each of several hundred ha.  About half of the direct cost of
maintaining the distribution system could be passed to the farmers if they were
to be made responsible for the O&M within the minor blocks.   Accordingly,
agreement has been reached with HMGN that (a) when the SNIP system achieves a
satisfactory and reliable silt-free supply, O&M within the minor blocks receiving
a satisfactory supply would be handed over to WUGss and (b) the irrigation charge
But excludes the Indian investment between 1954 and 1975.

on improved areas in Stage I and Stage II, receiving a satisfactory supply, would
be increased to cover the cost of O&N of the distribution system above .he minor
block, together with a pro-rata share (based on hectarage served) of the costs of
06M of the main and distribution canal system.

40.   The main  environmental  concern  in the project  is  related to the
construction of the headworks culvert.  There were two design options for the
culvert - a flexible option and a rigid option, the former of whioh would have
required a larger quantity of boulders.   Therefore, the main issue concerned
removal of large boulders from adjacent torrential streams for use with the
flexible design option. About 90,000 m3 of boulders would have been needed for
the flexible option, and removal of such a large quantity of boulders would have
caused erosion of their banks. After a detailed study, the conclnsion was that
the rigid option is technically and environmentally better and cheaper, and this
has been adopted in the final design.

41.   No resettlement is expected to be necessary under the project because the
project area is uninhabited.
BiparlAn !^n,
42.   The effectiveness of che new headworks and the flow at Chatra would not be
affected by any developments in China, as the Kosi River rises in the high
Himalayas -where consumptive use is not possible and diversion unlikely.   The
proposed Arun III hydroelectric scheme on a tributary of the Kosi would not have
any detrimental influence on the flows at Chatra.  The proposed project is in
accordance with the Rosi Project Agreement of 1954, as amended in 1975, between
India and Nepal and would implement the original intent of the Kosi Agreement by
making it possible to irrigate the area which was constructed by India as part of
the Agreement.   There would be no change of impact on Bangladesh, as the dry
season flow is already diverted by India at the Kosi Barrage. For these reasons,
in the asseFsment of Bank Staff, the Project, which involves only alterations to
an ongoing scheme, would not cause appreciable harm to the other riparians, nor
would it be so 'harme1 by the use of the waters of the Xosi River by the other
riparians.

43.   The risks are similar to other large-scale irrigation investments in Nepal
including the po'ssible failure to maintain and manage the facilities and those
associated with extracting water from one of the world's greatest rivers which
has enormous destructive power.   These risks would be reduced by appropriate
design technology. For the river intakes, the advice of four leading specialists
in fluviology has been obtained.
44.   The other risks that could affect the achievement of the project objectives
include inability to maintain the mechanical installation, poor water management
of the improved water supply and lack of funds for O&M.  For the mechanical
maintenance, the design would be kept extremely simple, using a modified form of
cutter suction dredger, and provision would be made for technical assistance for
the operation of the dredgers until the end of the project. For the irrigation
system, a simple but effective design has been adopted based on a century of
successful experienc6 in Northwest India. Farmers would be organized into WUGs,
which would eventually take responsibility for the O&N below the minor head level
and thus reduce the direct cost burden on HMGN. To ease the financial burden of
O&M, the necessary energy for the dredge operation would be supplied by a small



-10-
microhydro unit at the canal head. Finally, the risk of implementation delays
has been reduced as detailed designs have been agreed with HMGN, and experienced
international contractors have been selected.
45.   I am satisfied that the proposed credit would comply with the Articles of
Agreement of the Association and recommend that the Executive Directors approve
it.
