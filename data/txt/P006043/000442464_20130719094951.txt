1.     Project context, development objectives, and design

1.      The project, originally comprising an IBRD loan (4454) and a Global
Environmental Fund (GEF) grant (TF 020548), was approved on March 1999 and
became effective in December 1999. The original closing date—September 30, 2005—
was extended twice before an Additional Financing (AF) loan (IBRD 7617) was
approved in 2008. Subsequently, the closing date of the original loan was extended two
more times, and the second loan was extended once. The economic crisis of 2001, which
led to sustained fiscal austerity, reduced budget allocations for governments at all levels
as well as for electricity subsidies in rural areas, delaying the implementation of the
original project and making necessary a set of six amendments to the project’s legal
agreements in order to adapt it to the country’s changing conditions and facilitate the
implementation of the project.

1.1    Context at appraisal

2.      By the late 1990s, the Government of Argentina (GOA) had made substantial
progress in developing a competitive and efficient electricity market. The sector had been
unbundled at the federal level, a well-functioning regulatory system had been established,
together with an ambitious privatization process, and the sector was achieving high
outputs at low utility rate levels. Privatization at the provincial level was underway.
These measures, however, were largely oriented to benefit the urban population, which
had been traditionally served by federal and provincial public enterprises. There was
much yet to be done to address the needs of the mostly poor rural population and to
introduce renewable energy systems (RES). Four main issues associated with the rural
sector were:
              There were 2.5 million people (8 percent of Argentina’s population) living
               in dispersed rural areas with no access to electricity.
              Providing electricity in dispersed areas implied high investment costs.
              Provincial governments (PGs) had limited financial capability to address
               the rural electricity challenge; and
              Provincial regulatory agencies (PRAs) were particularly weak.
The GOA strategy to address these issues comprised:
            Creating a regulatory and policy environment to encourage private sector
             participation in providing electricity to rural areas;
            Improving the efficiency of energy services delivery; and
            Strengthening the institutional and technical capability of PRAs.

3.      The project aimed at supporting the Government’s rural energy strategy. It was
part of the Bank’s country assistance strategy (CAS – Report # 1605-AR, April 24, 1997)
as it was designed to support the promotion of private sector investment in infrastructure
as well as the development of an appropriate regulatory and policy framework for the
power sector. At the same time, the project focused on the rural poor and promoted
environmentally sustainable management of natural resources.



                                            1
 

4.     The project’s GEF component was justified on the grounds of the GEF Climate
Change Operational Program #6, “Promoting the adoption of renewable energy,? since its
goal was to remove barriers to the adoption of such technologies and reduce
implementation costs. GEF support was aimed at reducing information barriers for both
investors and customers, addressing high initial costs barriers to Renewable Energy
Systems (RES), and training the regulatory agencies in the monitoring of renewable
energy operations of concessionaires.

5.      A second IBRD loan (AF, IBRD 7617) was appraised and approved in 2008, once
the country had recovered from the crisis of the early 2000s. The original project had
established a positive track record, and there was a high and growing demand for its rural
access outputs.

1.2   Original Project Development Objectives (PDO) and key indicators (as
approved)
6.     The Project Development Objectives, as approved in 1999, were:
       a.     Provide rural areas with reliable electric supply in a sustainable manner,
              using renewable energy technologies, when feasible;
       b.     Support the creation of sustainable business operations for rural energy;
       c.     Support the expansion of private sector participation in the provision of
              electricity in rural areas and the corresponding strengthening of provincial
              government capacities to regulate that participation; and
       d.     Advance the reform of the energy sector in particular critical areas.

7.     The Global GEF objectives were:
       a.    Remove market barriers to application, implementation, and dissemination
             of renewable energy sources; and
       b.    Reduce greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions by replacing small-diesel
             electricity generation; use candles, kerosene, and gas cylinders in lighting
             and other domestic uses with RES.

8.     A set of thirty-eight performance indicators was originally agreed upon and
       incorporated into the Project Implementation Plan. These were subsequently
       aggregated (see section 2.3).

1.3   Revised PDO (as approved by original approving authority), key indicators,
and reasons/justification
9.       The crisis of 2001 made necessary several revisions to the project’s design in
order to adapt to the country’s changing conditions and facilitate the implementation of
the project. These revisions were reflected in a set of six amendments to the legal
agreements. Whereas the original PDOs as well as most of the project’s activities
remained unchanged, greater emphasis was given to specific components (e.g., school
electrification and residential solar home systems-SHS), and additional components were
added (e.g., thermal applications and water pumping in public buildings), while the
emphasis on a private oriented reform was reduced. Correspondingly, the objectives of



                                            2
 

the AF were slightly modified1, and new and more specific key performance indicators
(KPI) were added.

10.     The beneficiaries of the project identified at the design stage were the thousands
of low-income households located in the rural dispersed areas of at least eight Argentine
provinces. The project was finally implemented in almost the whole country (19
provinces). It was also expected that the project would benefit the private sector in
enabling the creation of sustainable business operations through concessions and the
expansion of the market for renewable energy equipment, since part of this equipment is
produced by local industries. Also, central and provincial governments were expected to
benefit through the achievement of their rural electrification targets.
11.     While on a relatively limited scale, the project was also expected to provide
global benefits through the reduction of greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions.

1.5      Original components (as approved)
12.      The project’s components originally approved in 1999 were the following:
         a.     Installation and operation in about eight provinces by private
                concessionaries of: (i) solar home systems (SHS) in about 65,500
                dispersed rural households; (ii) small off-grid electricity generating units
                (with output range of 3 kW to 10 kW each) based on RES, namely
                photovoltaics, small wind turbines and mini-hydro plants, and diesel units
                to supply about 3,500 households living in agglomerated villages; and (iii)
                about 1,100 RES to provide electricity to provincial public institutions
                (schools, medical centers, police stations);
         b.     Installation of pilot wind home systems in two communities; and
         c.     A capacity building program consisting of technical assistance to
                facilitate: (i) the implementation of the program; (ii) the consolidation of
                power sector reforms in the country; and (iii) the development of the
                technical and institutional capabilities required for broader adoption of
                RES, together with a training program to strengthen the capacity of the
                provincial regulatory agencies.

1.6      Revised components
13.          Following the impact of the economic crisis of 2001 and arising needs for specific
renewable energy uses, the project’s components were revised on several occasions.
These revisions made necessary the amendment of legal agreements and were reflected
also in the components of the additional financing (AF) approved in 2008. Building on
steady improvements in the implementation performance of the original loan, the AF
operation was aimed at expanding significantly the scale and geographical scope of the
project. It also included new renewable energy components, such as 140 solar-thermal
systems and 30 solar powered water pumps.

  The original PCOs (c) and (d) were replaced by: “support the strengthening of private sector participation
in the provision of electricity in rural areas of the participating provinces…? and “support studies by the
borrower of critical energy sector issues,? respectively.

        1.7     Other significant changes
        14.    In response to the implementation problems encountered as a result of the crisis,
        the legal agreements were amended six times to achieve a more flexible and robust
        service model better aligned to the true capacity of public and private entities.
        Amendments focused mostly on allowing a broader set of concessionaires (incorporating
        public entities), incorporating renewable technology options, and increasing the
        contribution of the IBRD loan and GEF grant in the financing of the upfront costs of the
        systems. The following table presents a summary of the amendments:

                          schools.                     rural schools and other rural public installations and

15.     The crisis of 2001 had a major impact on the project’s implementation progress
during the early 2000s, causing severe budget cuts, delays, and the need to make
significant revisions to the delivery model. Consequently, the closing date for the first
IBRD loan and GEF grant was extended four times. The implementation period was
extended considerably, from six years and five months to twelve years and nine months
(including the AF) and ten years and nine months, respectively. The closing date of the
AF operation was extended once, from December 2011 to December 2012. All
extensions were justified in terms of the need to ensure the achievement of project
development objectives.

2.     Key factors affecting implementation and outcomes

2.1    Project preparation, design, and quality at entry

16.    The project was prepared and designed during a period of thorough economic
reform among most Latin American countries. In Argentina, the reform was
characterized by the promotion of private sector investment in infrastructure and, in the
power sector, the development of an appropriate regulatory framework supporting a
competitive electricity market. Within this context, the project was conceptualized as one
more step in consolidating the reform. The Government opted for a private-sector
oriented approach that relied heavily—and exclusively—on private concessionaires that
would contribute to the operation and also to the financing of the project.

17.     As noted, the project was proposed as part of the Bank’s Country Assistance
Strategy (CAS – Report # 1605-AR, April 24, 1997), and consistent with the GEF
objectives. It was designed to address the following issues:
               Lack of access of rural populations to energy supply at a cost and rate
                level that is affordable by the provincial governments and in particular by
                poor consumers;
               High up-front costs and lack of local information and experience in using
                renewable energy systems (RESs); limited capacity of provincial
                governments (PGs) and provincial regulatory agencies (PRAs); and
               Fine tuning of the electricity policy and strengthening of the institutional
                framework.
18.     Along the lines of the trends of the late 1990s, the private concession approach for
off-grid services was perceived to have many potential advantages, such as mobilizing
fresh and additional human and financial resources while moving towards a more
competitive and efficient energy service delivery. Accordingly, the financing plan of the
project proposed the following contributions:




                                             5
 


                                              Players         Financing Contribution (%)
                 Private concessionaires                                                    36
                 Governments, national and provincial                                       22
                 Customers                                                                    9
                 IBRD and GEF                                                               33

19.    The legal framework established for the implementation of the project included
Implementation Agreements between the GOA and each province and a contractual
agreement between the province and each concessionaire. These agreements established
the conditions of GOA support to the provinces (e.g., financing, funding for subsidies) as
well as the obligations of provinces and concessionaires, including compliance with
agreements with the World Bank, requirements for quality of service, etc.

20.     The Bank’s participation was justified as a necessary complement to the financing
plan, particularly in supporting capital investments. The Bank’s expertise and
international experience were equally important in pioneering a large-scale delivery
mechanism for renewable energy services. It was also considered that the Bank’s
presence would help ensure transparency in awarding concessions and ensuring that the
project was designed and implemented within the framework of the reformed electricity
sector. Global Environmental Fund (GEF) involvement was considered necessary for a
more rapid implementation and penetration of renewable energy technologies.

21.     The three components of the original project (section 1.5) were designed to
address the following market barriers: (i) need for substantial investment resources; (ii)
insufficient information for prospective concessionaires; (iii) risks associated with the
market acceptance of relatively new renewable energy technologies; and (iv) limited
capacity of PGs and PRAs to supervise project progress and technical assistance. It was
perceived that the project’s success would depend on its capacity to overcome said
barriers. No other risks were contemplated.

22.    The design process took into account alternative courses of action regarding
delivery mechanisms, technical, and financial aspects, as well as incorporating lessons
derived from Bank studies and ongoing projects.2 It was acknowledged at the outset that
there was a need for subsidies and it was agreed to finance them through the Electricity
Investment Development Fund (FEDEI)3, the IBRD loan (through the Government of
Argentina) and the GEF grant. A 50 percent subsidy was proposed for the initial
investment and it was agreed that any gap that may arise in the financing of subsidies to
                                                       
2
  Lessons learned include the Bank’s recent experience in financing SHSs, the implementation of small
power purchase agreements, economic and financial analysis of rural electrification projects, demonstration
efforts in renewable energy technologies, and incentives systems (taxes, duties and subsidies) consistent
with long-term objectives.
3
  FEDEI for its Spanish name: Fondo Especial de Desarrollo Eléctrico del Interior. This fund covered
investment costs. Operating and management (O&M) costs were subsidized partially through utility rates
by the Tariff Compensation Fund (FCT).


                                                          6
 

consumers, excluding operating and maintenance costs, would be closed by the
provincial governments using FEDEI funds.

23.     At the time of project preparation, the GOA had almost completed the reform of
the national power sector and had initiated the implementation of an Electric Supply
Program for the Rural Dispersed Population. These two factors were considered to be
clear indications of the GOA’s commitment and ownership of the project. Furthermore,
eight provinces had become participating provinces by signing letters of intent, and
market studies were underway in four of them. Also, an international workshop with
about 60 private investors, Provincial Rating Agencies, and NGOs was held.

24.      While it could be argued that the design of the project incorporated the most
recent experience in developing renewable energy resources in rural areas and certainly
reflected the conceptual reality of its times, it also had a few shortcomings that became
major obstacles during implementation. The project’s delivery model assumed the
continuation of the ongoing reform and provided very little room for flexibility in case
conditions changed. This lack of flexibility was reflected in the fact that the model relied
fully and exclusively on the role of private concessionaires and on acceptance of a rigid
list of technology options. While it is fair to say that the preparation of a sector project
was not the most effective channel to foresee the eventual collapse of the country’s
economic and political model—nor it is expected that it should have done it— country
risk was absent from the design process, as well as the possible demand for other
renewable energy technologies.

25.     Another shortcoming in the design of the project was the absence of clearly
defined eligibility criteria to choose or establish priorities/amounts to be assigned among
the beneficiary populations and provinces. While this lack of definition introduced into
the project’s design a degree of flexibility that allowed an early start in some provinces, it
led also to a first come first serve process, wherein the institutionally stronger regions
could benefit more in spite of the policy orientation of the project.

2.2    Implementation

26.     The economic crisis that impacted Argentina between 2001 and 2003 led to
sustained fiscal austerity that resulted in reduced budget allocations to the project as well
as diminished subsidy support from the FEDEI and the Tariffs Compensation Fund
(FCT). It also meant a shift in the Government of Argentina’s economic policy, moving
away from a private sector-oriented strategy. The austerity measures also weakened the
organizational structure of the Secretariat of Energy (SE) and the Project Coordinating
Unit (PCU), reducing the number of employees in key functions and causing serious
delays in the project’s implementation. Other factors contributing to a slow
implementation were a complicated approval process at the provincial level and a
considerable increase in the cost of photovoltaic systems.

27.     A Bank supervision mission held in the midst of the crisis (November 2002)
provided the following snapshot in its Implementation Status and Results Report (ISR
#8), that illustrates the gravity of the situation: (i) absence of a local budget which caused


                                              7
 

major delays in procurement and debilitated implementation capacity; (ii) cancellation of
contracts because of the lack of funds to support the necessary subsidies and the impact
of the local currency devaluation on the financial viability of the agreements; (iii)
postponement of agreements with concessionaires due to uncertainties associated with
rates; (iv) frozen distribution rates. Overall, the most important impact of the crisis was
the fact that the business environment deteriorated drastically and, hence, the delivery
model based on private concessionaires was no longer viable nor did it have political
support. This was aggravated by a set of inflexible characteristics of the project design,
requiring a departure from such an approach, restructuring the project, and moving
toward a more pragmatic and flexible model that allowed the participation of
cooperatives and public entities as concessionaires, a greater contribution of the Bank in
the financing plan (see Annex 1), and a broader set of technology options.

28.      While the project faced a crisis of large magnitude and exogenous nature, the fact
that it went through six amendments, instead of two or three, casts doubts on whether the
Bank did a comprehensive assessment of the situation and suggests that it was following
a trial and error approach.

29.     As events played out, the first IBRD loan had an implementation period of 12
years and 5 months, an unusually long period that meant an overall extension of almost
100 percent. The magnitude of the delay was such that by April 2005 (i.e., six months
before the original closing date) project disbursements had reached only 12.6 percent.
This extremely long implementation period brought considerable costs such as the late
delivery of the project’s benefits and the economic burden that this entailed, and much
higher supervision costs for government agencies and the Bank itself. . As the mid-term
review (MTR) was carried out in December 2001, i.e., at the moment when the country
plunged into a devastating economic crisis and the project had not really taken off, such
an early review yielded limited benefits.4 It is important to consider, however, that rural
access is, by nature, a medium- to long-term effort due to the multiplicity of actors
involved, the isolated areas to be covered, and the need to assure a behavioral change in
rural populations.

30.     The delay, however, also brought some benefits. Thanks to the successive
extensions, the project had time to revamp its delivery model, rebuild its implementing
capacity and, most important, as early results—particularly in the province of Jujuy—
made evident the potential benefits of the project, Government of Argentina ownership
was regained and other provinces became seriously interested. This is a common trend in
rural access operations. That is, the longer than usual implementation period gave room
for the dissemination of early results and the subsequent growth of demand for renewable
energy services through a model better adapted to the capacity (technical and financial)
of concessionaires, local governments, and customers. While by 2003 only the province
of Jujuy had shown some tangible progress, fifteen provinces became actively engaged

                                                       
4
 While the MTR of December 2001 identified a set of constraints associated with the crisis, such as the
provinces’ need for greater support from the GOA and the need for some amendments to the legal
agreements, it failed to acknowledge that the PDOs could not be achieved on time. Also, serious budget
problems surfaced in mid-July, after the MTR was held.

during the last years of the project as they were encouraged—and drew lessons—from
Jujuy’s success.

31.     An important and very successful component not foreseen in its full magnitude at
the design stage was the provision of solar home systems (SHS) and thermo-solar
systems for more than 2,000 schools and public services in 13 provinces. This component
required an investment of US$25.5 million, of which US$20.4 million were funded by
the two IBRD loans, US$4.6 million by a new participant, the Ministry of Education, and
US$0.5 million by provincial governments. The provision of renewable energy systems
(RES) in schools is enhancing the quality of education services and operations, as well as
constituting an effective dissemination of SHS and hot water benefits.

32.     Given the steady improvements in the project’s performance and disbursement
rates following the project restructuring and a recovering economy, the project’s
Implementation Performance (IP) was upgraded to “moderately satisfactory? in
November 2006, and to “satisfactory? in December 2007. The project established a solid
track record that, together with a growing demand for its outputs, justified the scaling-up
of the operation. Consequently, a second IBRD loan (AF) for US$50 million was
approved in December 2008. Since then, the project maintained a good performance—
though with some temporary exceptions—in almost all aspects, moving on track towards
achieving its development objectives. In fact, the AF doubled the project’s benefits
within a short time frame that contrasted with the implementation record of the original
loan. An AF was opted for, instead of a new free-standing operation, in order to minimize
the disruption that a more abrupt transition could have had on a project that had built the
required institutional capacity and was already performing well.

33.     Annex 1 presents the originally planned (at appraisal) and actual figures for the
project’s costs and financing. These figures make evident the consequences of the project
restructuring, i.e., a considerable increase in the Bank’s participation (IBRD and GEF,
from 33 percent to 95 percent) in the financing plan and a drastic reduction in the local
contribution, including an almost negligible contribution of private concessionaires. It
also shows a significant demand-driven shift in the use of the GEF grant for wind
systems in contrast to its original plan to support solar home systems (SHS). Overall, the
project addressed the needs of more than 30,000 customers in fifteen provinces according
to the following distribution: 25,071 residential SHS; 1,894 SHS in schools; 361 public
services; 2,407 in mini networks (solar, wind power, micro-hydro but mostly diesel
units); 350 solar thermal (mostly in schools) and 188 solar pumping.

34.     A technical assistance component comprising a large number of studies was
implemented in support of the project (market and feasibility studies for provinces,
project dissemination programs, surveys, energy productive uses) and to address specific
energy policy needs of the Secretariat of Energy—SE (e.g., daylight savings time policy,
promotion of hydroelectricity, energy efficiency, regulation and utility rates studies).

2.3        Monitoring and Evaluation (M&E) design, implementation and utilization

35.     At negotiations, a set of Key Performance Indicators (KPI) were agreed upon and
incorporated into the Project Implementation Plan. These KPI addressed eleven specific
objectives that were consistent with the PDO but did not match their structure. The
original 38 KPIs were not fully quantifiable nor did they always include precise target
values for their proper monitoring. As project implementation advanced and amendments
were made, the PCU proceeded to focus on the indicators that were quantifiable. To this
end, data were submitted to the provincial governments by the concessionaires,
cooperatives, and/or public utilities responsible for the implementation of the project in
each province, and were subsequently submitted to the PCU. These data were included in
the quarterly reports received by the World Bank and incorporated into the
implementation status and result reports (ISRs).

36.     The fifth amendment of the legal documents in 2006 included a revised set of
KPIs. This adjustment implied a considerable improvement that involved a fine-tuning of
the indicators with a better alignment to the PDO, and established clear quantifiable
targets. The approval of the AF operation in 2008 implied the incorporation of a new set
of indicators within the same structure (presented in Annex 2). It should be noted,
however, that KPIs did not seem to fully keep pace with revisions to the project design,
as evidenced by the fact that at project-end, some indicators for areas where there was no
demand, or which had proven ineffective, remained unchanged.5

2.4        Safeguard and fiduciary compliance.

37.     Environment. While the project is expected to yield environmental benefits
associated with the reduction of GHG emissions, it was recognized at appraisal that the
provision of RES could have minor negative environmental impacts related to the
installation of specific technologies and the management of wastes generated by the
maintenance and repair of equipment. Hence, the project was assigned an Environmental
Category B in accordance with OP 4.01, triggering the environmental assessment
safeguard. It was agreed at negotiations that all environmental concerns would be dealt
with in the concessionaires’ contract, which would include: (i) procedures for the
recycling or proper disposal of batteries used in SHS and WHS; (ii) procedures for the
disposal of solar cells; (iii) environmental siting criteria for micro-hydro schemes; and
(iv) procedures for storage, handling, and disposal of diesel fuel. These procedures were
also included in community information programs for the rural population. The actual
implementation of the project did not include a micro-hydro system, thus reducing
considerably the complexity of its environmental impact.

38.          Environmental safeguard compliance was rated satisfactory throughout the whole
implementation of the project. However, an assessment undertaken by the Bank in early
2011 concluded that some sub-projects, particularly mini-grids, could have
environmental and social impacts broader than what was foreseen at the design stage.
Given the advanced stage of implementation it was decided not to restructure the project
                                                       
5
     Such as RET-based mini-grids and wind home systems.


                                                   10
 

in this respect. Instead, the supervision of ongoing sub-projects was strengthened—
including a more rigorous review of Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA)— and data
was systematized. No negative impacts were detected.

39.     Social. Project preparation included extensive consultations with the public and
private sectors. A framework for a disseminating and consultation strategy was agreed
upon at this stage. Such a strategy, which was targeted to various rural customers,
covered the dissemination of project characteristics as well as mechanisms for customers’
participation in O&M and the monitoring of the sub-projects.

40.     As noted, originally the project did not trigger any social safeguards. However,
Bank supervision missions concluded that the project was likely to have a broader impact
than originally expected and should have triggered additional safeguards (i.e., indigenous
people, involuntary resettlement). Consequently, the Additional Financing triggered OP
4.10 on Indigenous Peoples, and the Bank proceeded to intensify its supervision and
dialogue on these subjects with the support of local specialists. Considering that in
several provinces some beneficiaries belong to indigenous peoples, a framework for the
management of indigenous populations was developed in order to guarantee an open
consultation process tailored to the characteristics of their culture.

41.    Procurement. Procurement activities were carried out in accordance with World
Bank guidelines. The original plan considered that the physical components of the project
would be implemented by the private sector in a decentralized manner. It was
contemplated that for concessions procured under the project, the concessionaire would
follow its own procurement rules, while concessions procured before 1999 would have to
follow the Bank’s guidelines. In practice, the second case applied since no new private
concessions were procured during the project. Procurement methods applied for goods
and their installation were International Competitive Bidding (ICB, for the selection of
new concessionaries and goods above a specified threshold), National Competitive
Bidding (NCB, for goods and installation) and prudent shopping for smaller packages.
Drawing lessons from early experience, a set of Special Procurement Provisions were
agreed upon for the AF. These focused mostly on improved procurement planning,
disseminating, and monitoring.

42.      While the procurement performance of the project is regarded as moderately
satisfactory, it was not free of problems. Like the rest of the project, procurement
activities had a slow start aggravated by the cancellation of one contract and major delays
caused by the lack of counterpart funds associated with the 2001 crisis. Also, institutional
weaknesses in several provinces caused delays in the procurement of goods.
Consequently, centralized procurement of goods was approved in mid-2006 (Fifth
Amendment to legal documents) in order to address capacity constraints and to seek the
benefits of economies of scale. Procurement performance ratings were downgraded to
moderately unsatisfactory on two occasions after post-review exercises revealed the
persistence of staff/resource weaknesses. However, these weaknesses were overcome as
teams were strengthened. The process benefited also from the local support of Bank
procurement specialists.



                                            11
 

43.     Financial management. The financial management (FM) arrangements for the
project were assessed during appraisal and found satisfactory. FM arrangements were
implemented in an adequate manner and maintained in similar fashion throughout the life
of the project, thus guaranteeing the proper use of the loans and grant proceeds. Annual
consolidated financial reports were submitted to the Bank in a timely manner in
compliance with the World Bank’s accounting policies and internal control procedures.

44.     External audits of the project financial statements were submitted on a regular
basis although with some delays during the initial years. The audits were satisfactory.
While in some exceptional cases audits were qualified (due to the temporary use of the
special account to cover local counterpart costs), no weaknesses were found in internal
controls.

45.     The provision of counterpart financing was satisfactory with the exception of the
crisis period, when it became one of the many obstacles to procurement activities and
contributed to delays.

2.5          Post-completion operation/next phase

46.     The project has succeeded in installing renewable energy systems to provide
electricity to more than 25,000 households, using SHS, WHS, mini-grids and a variety of
public services. The sustainability of these installations will rely on two main factors: (i)
a regulatory framework that provides a set of adequate incentives through electricity rates
that cover fully the operational costs and subsidies funded by secure sources; and (ii) an
effective operation and maintenance (O&M), and customer service, to guarantee an
appropriate quality of service.

47.     The project will be operated within a stable institutional framework defined by the
Participation Agreements signed by each province and the Concessions Contracts that
establish the responsibilities of various parties in guaranteeing the necessary funding as
well as in providing satisfactory operations and management. The project has helped in
establishing said regulatory system at the provincial level. Cost-based rates have been set
and subsidies established, taking into account the capacity to pay of rural customers in
each of the provinces involved.6 Provincial regulatory agencies have strengthened their
capacity and subsidies are being funded through the FEDEI and FCT. Hence, the post-
completion sustainability will rely mostly on the second factor: an adequate operation,
maintenance and commercial service of the existing installations. In this respect, the clear
definition of a responsible operator has proven to be a key factor for satisfactory service.
The experience of provinces that reached the operational stage earlier, as well as the role
of the PCU in disseminating this knowledge, will be of utmost importance. However, it
should be noted that the model or models being used have yet to be tested in most
provinces. Saving the institutional differences of the delivery models adopted from
                                                       
6
 Each province sets its subsidy levels, which range from around 20 percent to 80 percent of the operating
and maintenance costs, depending on their policies and specific rural socio-economic conditions. The
sustainability of this scheme depends on a well-established regulatory framework (strengthened by the
project) and its reliable funding sources.


                                                          12
 

province to province, the early and successful experience of Jujuy and other provinces in
addressing the logistical challenge of O&M is being used by others in designing their
operations. Further dissemination of good practices may be needed to help ensure the
project’s sustainability.
48.    It is important to mention that, as a result of the positive development outcomes
of the project and the increased demand that this has generated, the Government of
Argentina has requested a follow-up operation. Preparatory work is underway. This new
operation would guarantee institutional continuity and further strengthening of
implementing and operating capacity.

3.           Assessment of outcomes

3.1          Relevance of objectives, design and implementation
49.     The project’s outcomes continue to be relevant, particularly given current country
priorities and the high demand for renewable energy systems revealed in most provinces
during the last stages of project implementation. There are still isolated rural populations
that lack electricity. Within this context, the project has proven to be a valuable option in
responding to electricity access in rural areas. Multiple expressions of interest—from
provincial governments, concessionaires, utilities and customers—for the
continuation/expansion of the project confirm this relevance.
50      The project’s design reflected an ambitious effort to develop renewable energy in
rural areas with a strong emphasis on private sector development. This approach proved
to be unworkable when the impact of the 2001 crisis was felt. However, the viability and
relevance of the delivery model was restored through the restructuring measures noted
above, de-emphasizing the private development component when there was no existing
concessionaire while maintaining the essence of its objective: achieving an efficient and
sustainable delivery model for renewable energy services in dispersed markets.
51.     The project’s focus and progress in implementing renewable energy technologies,
and its technical support to facilitate this progress remain fully consistent with GEF’s
medium- to long-term objectives of reducing greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions.

3.2          Achievement of project development objectives

52.     As noted above, the project’s amendments and additions were reflected in an
adjusted set of KPI presented in Annex 2. Overall, the project satisfactorily met most of
the targets with the exception of the renewable energy technology (RET)-based mini-grid
component, where its cost effectiveness was overvalued at the design stage and,
subsequently, funds were allocated to other components (namely, solar home systems).
Overall, the shortfall in achieving the original targets—particularly with respect to the
total number of households reached and solar home systems installed—is explained by
the reduced resources allocated, which dropped from the US$120 million to US$100
million, in spite of the AF, as the local contribution was significantly reduced. A
quantitative estimate7 of the project’s achievements provides the following figures:

3.3          Efficiency

53.     An ex-post economic evaluation of the project, using actual data on costs, early
benefits, and the most recent market studies, yielded the following results (details in
Annex 3): an economic internal rate of return (EIRR) of 11.2 percent and a net present
value (NPV, at 10 percent discount rate) of US$1.14 million. These results are based on a
conservative forecast for future energy consumption (14.5 kWh per month per
household). In the case that such consumption should reach 24 kWh/month, as some
surveys suggest, the EIRR would reach 21.2 percent; and the NPV, US$11.1 million,
indicating the high sensitivity of the project’s economics to the future consumption of
solar energy. The results obtained are similar to the estimates at appraisal, which gave an
EIRR of 12.1 percent and NPV of US$5.1 million. It should be noted, however, that the
major delays experienced by the project—caused mainly by an inflexible design that
hampered the project’s capacity to react upon a crisis—had a negative impact on its
efficiency as benefits were delayed considerably.

54.     There was no similar evaluation at the design stage regarding mini-grids,
renewable energy services to public buildings, or wind home systems (the latter,
proposed as a pilot project). Regarding the financial evaluation, given that the provision
of energy to dispersed areas relies heavily on subsidies, the financial cash flow is not
expected to yield a financial rate of return with acceptable values. In particular, the
financial analysis for SHS would only yield cash benefits from replacing artisanal
lighting and the purchase of batteries, which do not capture the benefits of improved and
additional electricity source.

3.4          Justification of overall outcome rating
Rating: moderately satisfactory
                                                       
8
  In should be noted that the outputs and corresponding indicators that were actually monitored are, overall,
consistent with the PDOs, including the global GEF objectives (linked to output 4). The exceptions are
PDO (d) (advance the reform of the energy sector in particular critical areas) that was de-emphasized.
Instead, output 3 was incorporated as an indicator of operational sustainability.
9
  Averages assigned equal weights to all performance indicators except for Development Objective 1,
where weights were assigned proportional to scale of each component (e.g., residential SHS, public
services SHS, WHS).  


                                                          14
 

55.    Taking into account the confirmed relevance of the project’s objectives, the
progress made in achieving most of these objectives, and the positive results to date in
accomplishing a sustainable delivery model, the overall outcome rating is considered
moderately satisfactory.

56.     It spite of having recovered from the negative impact of the 2001 crisis, the rating
is not satisfactory because the project did not achieve its development objectives fully,
particularly with respect to its private development component and its shortcoming in
developing the proposed RET-based mini-grids component. Also, it took an excessively
long implementation period that delayed benefits and increased supervision costs, and
procurement delays jeopardized temporarily the achievement of the project’s
development objectives.10

3.5          Overarching themes, other outcomes and impacts

(a)          Poverty impacts, gender aspects, and social development
57.     The project provided access to electricity to more than 25,000 rural households
(around 100,000 people). The market studies undertaken among these beneficiaries reveal
the potential for considerable improvement in their quality of life associated with the
benefits of better and more reliable lighting and communications. This potential was
confirmed by the early assessment carried out by the PCU.11 Also, the provision of hot
water to schools and thermal stoves has proven to be particularly beneficial. The
provision of electricity has meant considerable savings stemming from the substitution of
renewables for traditional energy sources, which amount on average to around US$200
per year per household. Considering that the rural customers reached by the project are
mostly poor, said benefits are expected to have a significant impact on reducing poverty.

(b)          Institutional change/strengthening
58.     All parties recognize that, overall, the effort in implementing the project during a
difficult period, including the adoption of international standards in procurement and
financial management, as well as a rigorous monitoring and evaluation and treatment of
social and environmental safeguards, have contributed considerably to strengthening the
capacity of the implementing agencies for dealing with investment projects in rural areas,
both at the centralized level and in the provinces.

(c)          Other unintended outcomes and impacts (positive or negative)
59.          None were detected




                                                       
10 In fact, the project was rated MU for DO during its last year due to alarming procurement delays. This
low DO rating was kept until real outputs were achieved.

3.6    Summary of findings of beneficiary survey and/or stakeholder workshops
60.     Annex 6 summarizes the conclusions and recommendations of a workshop held
        in November 2012 with the participation of the provinces involved in the project
        plus the PCU.

4.     Assessment of risk to development outcome and global environment outcome

Overall rating: moderate.
61.      As noted above (section 2.5), the sustainability of the project’s outcome (the
benefits from providing renewable energy services in rural areas) will depend on an
adequate regulatory framework that provides the right incentives through electricity rates
and securely funded subsidies, and an effective operations and management and customer
services. The project will operate within a stable institutional environment characterized
by strengthened provincial regulatory agencies and generally well-established
concessionaires. Hence, risks to the development outcome will depend mostly on the
provincial operating entities and concessionaires’ capacity to address the technical and
logistical complexities of providing a satisfactory O&M service. While the effectiveness
of models adopted for these purposes has not been fully demonstrated, considering the
success of early implementation experiences, particularly in Jujuy, and the diversity of
institutional and logistical models being adopted, the risks of a decline in project benefits
is deemed to range from low to moderate.
GEF rating: moderate
62.    Same as above. Also, the Government of Argentina’s commitment to continued
development of renewable energy systems in rural areas is reflected in its interest in a
follow-up operation.

5.     Assessment of Bank and borrower performance

5.1    Bank performance

(a)    Bank performance in ensuring quality at entry
Rating: moderately satisfactory

63.     The project design incorporated the most recent experience in developing large-
scale renewable energy resources in rural areas. The design process took into account
alternative courses of action for delivery mechanisms and the lessons derived from Bank
studies and ongoing projects. The project concept was consistent with the ongoing reform
in the Argentine power sector, using a delivery model based on the dominant role of the
private sector. That is, the design reflected the conceptual reality of its times. Evaluations
of the borrower’s capacity were done objectively; and the implementation measures,
designed accordingly. Applicable safeguards were identified consistent with the practices
of the late 1990s.

64.   However, the project design did not take into account country risks and the slow
implementation typical of rural access operations, nor did it incorporate the required


                                             16
 

flexibility to deal successfully with changing economic and political conditions. In
hindsight, the project design could be seen as a candid effort to support an ongoing
reform without acknowledging associated risks.

(b)    Quality of supervision
Rating: moderately satisfactory

65.    During project implementation, the Bank maintained a constant presence in the
field with two or more supervision missions per year. Faced with the major and largely
unexpected challenge of the 2001 crisis, the Bank proceeded to restructure the project a
number of times—though after a brief period of surprise—to gradually adjust to changing
conditions, working together with the implementing agency in restoring a viable delivery
model.

66.     Fiduciary and safeguard aspects were dealt with diligently, although with some
delays in procurement. Adequate resources were allocated—in quantity and quality—
throughout the implementation period and the continued provision of valuable guidance
through local staff. Overall, the Bank demonstrated the capacity and flexibility to react
positively to unforeseen adverse events, take corrective measures and move toward the
achievement of PDOs. However, the fact that the project required an excessive number of
amendments suggests that the Bank was unable to assess the situation comprehensively
and anticipate problems. Also, the performance indicators did not seem to keep pace fully
with revisions to the project design.

(c)    Justification of rating for overall Bank performance
Rating: moderately satisfactory.
67.    This rating combines the ratings for project preparation and supervision.

5.2    Borrower performance
(a)    Government performance
Rating: moderately satisfactory
68      The Government supported the project throughout most of its execution. It
revealed a commitment to the provision of electricity in remote rural areas and the
development of renewable energy, and it took the necessary measures in restoring the
viability of the project. However, during a relatively long period, starting with the crisis
of 2001, budgets allocated to the project were insufficient, bringing about significant
delays in its implementation as well as visible weaknesses in the staffing of the
implementing agency. These weaknesses caused an irregular performance in procurement
and monitoring activities. Also, temporary uncertainties on rates policies discouraged
concessionaires and delayed their procurement initiatives.
(b)    Performance of implementing agency or agencies
Rating: satisfactory




                                            17
 

69.     Although the PCU experienced budget and staff constraints during the crisis
period and a few more years, it managed to build a core of qualified staff that managed
procurement and financial management issues well. This continuity helped maintain
satisfactory management and supervision. The decision to centralize procurement as a
measure to overcome the weaknesses of some provinces proved to be the correct one.
Also, decentralizing part of the PCU functions through two units working in the
provinces of the northwest and northeast improved the management and supervision of
that region. The management of safeguards and monitoring revealed a learning process
adapted to the changing standards of the times.

(c)     Justification of rating for overall borrower performance
Rating: moderately satisfactory

70.    Combines the ratings for Government and for the Implementing Agency.

6.     Lessons learned

71.     A large-scale renewable energy system project is a medium- to long-term
effort that requires a design flexible enough to adapt to the changing conditions that
may arise. Failure to do so may require cumbersome and costly restructuring efforts.
Projects designed in a rigid manner and without much room for flexibility are likely to
face greater obstacles as external (e.g., country risk) or internal conditions change, and
experience considerable delays and additional costs in their efforts to adjust. The
project’s experience also casts doubts on the effectiveness of short-term instruments in
addressing long-term rural development challenges.

72.    Subsidies are a necessary component of rural electricity projects, being
necessary to establish a sound system of rates and subsidies that minimizes
economic distortions; they are also funded by secure sources. Dispersed rural markets
are characterized by high costs and low income customers, requiring a significant subsidy
to ensure the installation and operation of renewable energy systems. These subsides
should be clearly defined in order to minimize uncertainties that could hamper bidding
processes as well as the operational phase of rural projects.

73.     The eligibility criteria for populations and/or regions to be provided with
rural electrification projects should be clearly established at an early stage in
keeping with the government’s policy orientation. The absence of such criteria can
result in a first-come, first-served situation that would tend to favor the regions/provinces
that are institutionally stronger and may deviate from the government’s social and
economic objectives (e.g., poverty reduction). While the flexibility gained by the lack of
an eligibility criterion could be useful in starting a rural access effort, it is essential to
avoid such deviations once a project has gained momentum.

74.    Safeguard issues need to be addressed thoroughly at an early stage and
incorporated into the project design in order to minimize negative and/or
irreversible impacts. The effective identification of social and environmental impacts,
and the pertinent safeguards, should be matter for an early and thorough assessment and


                                             18
 

incorporated into the design of bids (when mitigation or management measures entail a
cost borne by contractor). A late acknowledgment of such impacts implies higher
mitigation costs and often faces institutional inertia impeding its solution.

75.     Large-scale decentralized renewable energy operations face unique
challenges associated with the dispersion of their market, the large number of
players involved, limited knowledge of the terrain, and difficult communication that
requires a delivery model tailored to these needs. Specific lessons made evident by the
project are:
     Importance of dissemination: it is essential to disseminate among interested
        parties experiences of best practices and the benefits of renewable energy systems
        in order to develop effectively a renewable energy system (RES) market and
        achieve sustainable operation. A centralized executing agency should assume this
        responsibility in a proactive manner aiming to engage all possible participants
        working in the field, including provincial entities, NGOs and the private sector.
     Promote use of local resources: Local resources, when technically qualified,
        offer the advantage of a better knowledge of the region and often have stronger
        incentives to perform well. Bidding processes should take this potential into
        account and minimize obstacles for local contractors to participate (i.e., adapt bid
        requirements, such as guarantees, to the reality of the region).
     Sustainability of the operation is more a logistical challenge than a technical
        task: while photovoltaic (PV) and wind-power installations have a certain degree
        of technical complexity, the main challenge at the operational level is to provide
        effective maintenance and customer service in a market that is widely dispersed
        and often times located in rugged terrain. Innovative approaches tailored to each
        case—but often relying on local resources—are necessary to provide an effective
        and low-cost service.

expected outcomes. However, considering the various amendments to the legal
agreements and drawing on lessons from the initial experience of the project, the set of
indicators originally proposed was modified. The table below presents the project’s
outputs by the closing date.12

Annex 3.       Economic analysis

Following the appraisal’s approach, the economic analysis focuses on the residential
photovoltaic component, i.e., the Solar Home Systems (SHS) that were installed by the
PERMER in 13 provinces, accounting for 53 percent of the project’s total investment
during its two phases (original IBRD loan and GEF grant plus the IBRD additional
financing).
The economic internal rate of return for the residential solar component is 11.2 percent
and its net present value (NPV) is estimated to be US$1.14 million, based on a 10 percent
discount rate that, as at appraisal, is considered to be the economic opportunity cost of
capital in Argentina. These results are based on a conservative forecast for future energy
consumption (14.5 kWh per month per household). In case consumption should reach
24kWh/month, as surveys suggest, the rate of return would reach 21.2 percent and the
NPV US$11.1 million, thus indicating the high sensitivity of the project’s economics to
the future consumption of solar energy. These results compare to a rate of return of 12.1
percent estimated at appraisal (9.5 percent excluding the benefits of the GEF grant) and a
NPV 0f US$5.1 million (negative US$1.44 million without GEF).
Costs. The analysis includes the actual investment cost of US$50.3 million for 23,419
Solar Home Systems installed by the project. It also includes a cost of US$65 per unit for
the replacement of batteries every four years, annual operating and maintenance costs,
and an economic life of fifteen years.
Benefits. Solar Home Systems have two types of benefits: on the one hand, they replace
the expense associated with traditional energy sources, i.e., lighting and communications
devices such as kerosene lamps, candles, gas, and batteries, by using solar panels whose
running costs are practically negligible (replacement of parts and batteries are considered
as maintenance costs and are taken into account in the analysis). In addition to the
savings over traditional lighting and communications devices, photovoltaic systems make
available more energy—and of better quality—and therefore they bring additional
welfare benefits to the beneficiaries. Benefits are explained in the following figure that
represents schematically the rural household demand for energy:




                                            25
  

 When using traditional energy, users consume QK at price PK and the value of saved
 traditional energy resources is given by areas B+D. Once the consumer adopts a PV
 system, demand increases to QPV at price PPV, and the additional benefits associated with
 the extra energy are given by areas C+E. A straight-line approximation to the demand
 curve is used given the lack of quantifiable information regarding consumers’
 preferences. The analysis considers the case of a single PV customer using a 100Wp
 panel (by a wide margin the most used panel in the project) with the following
 characteristics based on the findings of surveys undertaken in various provinces:
 QK: 86 kWh per year
 Savings in traditional energy (B+D): US$210 per year, which yields a unit cost of
 US$2.44/kWh
 QPV: 175 kWh per year (with a sensitivity for 296 kWh per year, based on market study
 forecasts)
 PPV: US$0.0 per kWh (i.e., running costs are sole fixed maintenance costs)
 The table below presents the flow of costs and benefits for the project’s SHS component
 in thirteen provinces.

Annex 6.        Stakeholder workshop report and results

A three-day workshop with the participation of the fifteen provincial governments
involved in the project plus the PCU was held in November 2012 to discuss the
performance and impact of the project and propose recommendations for an eventual
follow-up operation. The workshop was characterized mostly by technical presentations
that did not focus much on social aspects. It arrived to the following conclusions:
     1. The project was perceived as a highly valuable effort in addressing the needs of
        dispersed rural populations, improving their quality of life through the provision
        of electricity services;
     2. Implementation conditions differ greatly from province to province, depending on
        timing issues, the number of customers and the nature of the problems
        encountered;
     3. Most provinces coincided on the presence of a considerable demand for
        renewably energy systems that would justify a follow-up operation;
     4. A follow-up operation would benefit from a better coordination among current
        players, improved dissemination and the incorporation of new stakeholders in its
        design and implementation;
     5. Installation and operation costs vary significantly across provinces. Also, there
        was the perception that there is room for a more efficient implementation to
        improve the project’s economic viability;
     6. More emphasis should be given to the needs of vulnerable people; women, the
        young and indigenous populations.

Annex 7.        Summary of borrower's ICR

The Borrower issued a draft ICR in March 2013. This report presented a brief history of
the project, including its background and context under which it was design and justified.
It includes also the difficulties faced during the implementation period, the restructuring
effort, results and an assessment of outcomes. A summary of the report’s chapter 9:
Lessons Learned is included below:
     1. Technical aspects: the project was executed following the technological options
        and selection criteria originally established, prioritizing those that would
        guarantee a good performance from a technical, economic, social and
        environmental viewpoint. Technical specifications were prepared by the PCU
        with the support of some PEAs. These specifications were modified and
        broadened with the support of the Ministry of Education.
     2. Procurement issues: the most important adjustment in this regard was the
        centralization of procurement for equipment and the inspection and certification
        of works and installations. The integral financing of the project, permanent
        control and supervision, financial support to provincial inspectors, quick response
        to amendment needs proved to be instrumental for the satisfactory completion of
        the project.
     3. Works and systems installations: a more agile and appropriate process was
        achieved in those provinces where bidding was carried out by distribution utilities
        upon the request of the provincial government. Conversely, legal restrictions —
        sometimes requiring the approval through decrees— caused delays in the
        execution of works due to the lack of resources for the inspection of works.
        Experience shows the need to continuously update a list of future customers.
     4. Operation and Maintenance: participation agreements signed by each province
        establish the need for an entity responsible for the O&M of the equipment
        installed. It coincides that the most satisfactory results are being achieved in those
        provinces where the responsible entity has been clearly identified; hence,
        sanctions are being considered for those provinces that do not comply with this
        condition.
     5. Social and Environmental issues: acknowledging that in some provinces a large
        percentage of the project beneficiaries are indigenous people, an IPPF has been
        prepared in these provinces. Regarding the environmental impact of the project,
        no adverse impacts have been found during implementation; however, a
        framework to address such impacts, particularly in mini-grids, was elaborated for
        the AF.

The report assessed the performance of the provincial implementing agencies and the
World Bank in the following manner:
     1. Provincial Executing Agencies: in general, their performance is considered
        acceptable.
     2. World Bank: acceptable performance. While the implementation of the project
        extended through a long period, it is perceived that the performance of the Bank
        varied with time and there were periods when the Bank’s response to the PCU

     requests—particularly on procurement and its reaction to the crisis—were
     excessively long.
