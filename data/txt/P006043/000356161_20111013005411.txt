             Renewable Energy in the Rural Market Project Additional Financing
                                     IBRD 76170-AR

                                     Restructuring Paper


1. The closing date for Argentina, Renewable Energy in the Rural Market Project Additional
Financing (AF), IBRD 76170-AR will be extended from December 31, 2011 to December 31, 2012.

2. Overall, the implementation is on track to achieve the Project’s objectives. The Project
Development Objectives (PDO) and Implementation Progress (IP) are rated satisfactory. While
the project has encountered some operational difficulty in working with the provincial
governments and concessionaires as required, as of September 13, 2011, US$47.7 million of
US$50 million of the additional financing loans have been committed in 24 signed contracts, of
which US$20.83 million have been disbursed. The extension would not affect the development
objective, activities, indicators, or other aspects of the Project. The PDOs continue to be
achievable.

3. Despite the strong performance in overall project implementation since the effectiveness of
the AF, delays have made it impossible to complete implementation by the current closing date.
Implementation of the AF loan has experienced delays because: (i) it took 16 months for the AF
to become effective after Board approval, and (ii) significant time has been spent in amending
the existing subsidiary agreements between the implementing agency Secretariat of Energy and
participating provinces (the “participation agreement?) and between participating provinces and
concessionaires/public utility (the “implementation agreement?), as well as in signing
agreements in provinces new to the Project. Since these subsidiary agreements are part of the
disbursement conditions as provided in Section IV.B.1.(b) in the Loan Agreement, execution of
the signed contracts has been delayed until the disbursement conditions are met for the provinces
involved. The delays in complying with the Project’s disbursement conditions are largely
outside the control of the implementing agency, which is the major reason for this request. It is
estimated that, with the extension, US$14 million of the US$50 million AF loan would not need
to be cancelled because all of the contracts would be able to complete by the proposed new
closing date, and that approximately 6,000 households and 30,000 people (approximately 1/3 of
the Project target) would receive electricity services from the Project. With this objective, the
Borrower has in place an action plan to complete the Project within the proposed extension date.

4. The original PERMER Project was approved by the Board on March 30, 1999, including $30
million of IBRD 4454-AR loan and $10 million of GEF TF020548 grants. The GEF portion
was closed on December 31, 2009 and the IBRD portion was extended to December 31, 2011
along with the approval of AF. PERMER Additional Financing was approved by the Board on
November 11, 2008. This will be the first extension for AF.
