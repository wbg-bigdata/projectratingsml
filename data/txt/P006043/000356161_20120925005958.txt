                                  Restructuring Paper


       A. SUMMARY

1.      This restructuring package seeks your approval for a Level II restructuring of the
Renewable Energy in the Rural Market Project Additional Financing – PERMER AF
project (Loan No. IBRD-76170-AR), referred to as the “Project?, which would entail a
reallocation of loan proceeds. The proposed changes would maximize the Project’s
impact by responding to the high demand from the provinces for solar home systems,
lack of demand for wind home systems, and the difficulty in identifying eligible mini-
grid subprojects and allow a full disbursement of the remaining IBRD loan. The
Development Objective of the Project would remain the same.

       B. PROJECT STATUS

2.       The Project’s Development Objective (PDO) is to (a) provide the rural areas of
the Participating Provinces with reliable electric supply in a sustainable manner using
renewable energy technologies, when feasible; (b) support studies by the borrower of
critical energy sector issues; (c) support the creation of sustainable business operations
for rural energy in Argentina; and (d) support the strengthening of the private sector in
the provision of electricity in the rural areas of the participating provinces and the
corresponding strengthening of provincial government capacities to regulate private
sector participation.

3.      The achievement of PDO is rated moderately unsatisfactory because
approximately 9,000 solar home systems (half of the total) remain to be installed within
five months and before the project is closed. All equipment has been purchased but the
installations have been slower than expected due to changes in potential beneficiaries and
limited access to some areas during rainy seasons. It is expected that the installations
increase exponentially in the next three months and be completed by the closing date.
The PDO rating is expected to be upgraded around November 2012.

4.      The Overall Implementation Progress is rated moderately satisfactory. Although
disbursements of the loan have been slower than originally expected, the implementation
is on track to achieve the Project’s objectives. As of July 20, 2012, US$ 40.3 million of
the US$ 50 million loan were disbursed. This leaves approximately US$9.7 million of
the loan remaining to be disbursed.

       C. PROPOSED CHANGES

Financing

5.      The restructuring proposes to move unused project funds from various
components and corresponding disbursement categories (inclusive of technical assistance
and investment activities) to finance the purchase and installation of additional residential
solar home systems under Component 1.a. The reallocation is proposed to maximize the
Project’s impact, responding to the high demand from the provinces for solar home
systems, lack of demand for wind home systems, and the difficulty in identifying eligible
mini-grid subprojects.

6.     The proposed reallocations do not introduce significant changes to the Project. It
represents a minor change in line with BP 13.05 (Project Supervision). Most of the
changes involve moving funds from Components 2, 3, and 4 to Component 1 and
between the sub-components within Component 1 as a result of the high demand for solar
home systems.

7.      The level of financing for various project components as a result of the proposed
reallocations are illustrated in the following table:

1.      The Project’s PDO is rated moderately unsatisfactory because approximately 9,000 solar
home systems (half of the total) remain to be installed within five months and before the project
is closed. All equipment has been purchased but the installations have been slower than expected
due to changes in potential beneficiaries and limited access to some areas during rainy seasons.
It is expected that the installations increase exponentially in the next three months and be
completed by the closing date. The PDO rating is expected to be upgraded around November
2012. As of July 2012, US$49.1 million of the US$50 million additional financing loans have
been committed. A total of US$40.3 million had been disbursed as of July 20 2012, a significant
increase over the previous twelve months (disbursement was $14.4 million in June 2011). All
funds are expected to be disbursed when the project closes in December 2012.
