IREPORT ANqD RECOIMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT TO THiE
EXE(MUTIVE DIRECTORS ON A PROPOSED LOAN TO MALAYSIA FOR
A SECOND TELECO0UNICATTIONS PROJECT
1.       I submit the following report and recommendation on a proposed
loan in an amount in various currencies equivalent to US$18.7 million to
Malaysia for a second telecommunications project. The loan would be for
a term of 20 years including a 5 year period of grace and bear interest
at the rate of 7i6 per annum.
PART I - HISTORICAL
2.       The proposed loan would be the fifteenth to Malaysia and the
second for t;elecommunications. Other loans have been made for projects
in agriculture, forestry, industrial finance, power, water supply and
education. The execution of these projects has been satisfactory and
disbursements have proceeded zs expected. In the past few months the
Bank has cancelled US$2 million of Loan 458-MA and US$2 million of
Loan 579-MA at the request of the Borrower because of savings
in the foreign exchange costs of the projects. The closing dates for
two loans, Loan 434-NA (Muda Irrigation) made in 1965 and Loan 500-MA
(Kemubu Irri.ation) made in 1967, now appear to require postp,onement in each
case by about 18 maonths to June 30, 1973 and Decenber 31, 1973 respectively.
Although the Muda project is 95 percent completed and double cropping
was successfully introduced on about one-third of the project area
during the first season of 1970, some works such as slope stabilization,
pumping installation, widening of some roads and bridges, and local drain
improvements still have to be carried out.  In the case of Loan 500-MA
(Kemubu Irrigation) the main features of the project wTill be completed by
the end of 1971 and double-cropping on about two-thirds of the project
area is expected to start in March 1972. However, due to various delays,
including delayed deliveries following the recent floods in West Malaysia,
it is not expected that the quaternary canals, a number of pumping stations
and road surfacing on canal banks can be completed until early 1973.
3.       As of April 30, 1971 the amount of loans held by the Bank, net
of cancellations, sales and repayments was US$23h-2 million.  In addition,
the Bank made a loan in 1965 to the Public Util-ttes Board of Singapore
(405-MA), guaranteed by Malaysia, to finance the Johore River water project.
For a summary of Bank loans and IFC investments in Malaysia see Annex I.
PART II - THE ECONOM1Y
4.       An economic mission visited Malaysia in October/November 1970
and prepared a report entitled "Development Problems and Prospects of
Malaysia" (EAP-23a) dated May 17, 1971.  Updated basic economic data are
provided in Annex II.



5.       Malaysia's economic growth in recent years has been satisfactory
and financial stability has been preserved, despite lagging private and
public investment. The economy was stimulated by rising output from the
heavy investments of the early 1960's, especially the planting and
replanting of rubber and oil palm, which have long gestation periods,
and the development of timber resources. Continuing the trend of the
early 1960's, real GNP increased by about 6 percent a year between 1965
and 1970. Malaysia's per capita GNP is now about US$340 - one of' the
highest in South East Asia.
6.       Malaysia's economic growth was achieved in the face of a
continuing deterioration in the terms of trade, which cost Malaysia a
real income loss of about 5 percent between 1965 and 1970. Both the
output and the productivity of Malaysia's export sector have been
significantly raised, particularly in natural rubber and exports have
been diversified to include such important items as palm oil and forest
products. Malaysia is the world's largest exporter of natural rubber,
tin, palm oil and tropical hardwood.  At the same time, import substitution
in agriculture and manufacturing has reduced the relative importance of
imports from 47 percent of OUP in 1965 to 42 percent in 1970.
7.       Despite the good measure of overall economic growth, unemployment
has continued to increase, especially in West Malaysia, and is currently
estimated at 8-9 percent of the labor force. This is due to the rapidly
increasing labor force and the declining employment in estate agriculture
and mining because of rising labor productivity. The highest unemployment
rate (20 percent) is found among the 15-19 year olds without previous
job experience. The growth in labor supply is likely to accelerate in
the future and the unemployment situation will therefore deteriorate
further unless the rate at which employment is created can be significantly
raised from its recent level of 2.5 percent a year. Hence, unemployment
could well become a serious social and political problem. Malaysia is
therefore attempting to formulate a development strategy which seeks
simultaneously to promote economic growth, to create employment and to
reduce the economic disparity between the Malay and non-Malay communities.
8.       The current sluggishness in investment, which dropped from 19 to
16 percent of GNP between 1965 and 1970, is of particular concern because
of its long-term effects on the prospects for economic growth.   The recent
slowdown of private investment was most clearly evident in the continuous
decline in rubber plantings and replantings since 1965, following the
virtual completion of the massive postwar replanting programs. Despite
the availability of even higher yielding varieties of rubber trees, planta-
tions do not invest more because of difficulties in obtaining new land
or unwillingness to make investments in projects with very long gestation
periods. Investments in tin mines also levelled off after the large
investments in 1960-65.
9.       Public investment, both federal and state, virtually stagnated
after 1965, largely due to the Government's insufficient capacity to
identify, prepare and implement investment projects. This constraint



has gradually become more apparent in the last five or six years with
the continuous departure of expatriate staff and the Government's efforts
to Malayanize the civil service. Thus the operating ministries suffer
from a general shortage of staff at the technical and sub-technical levels
because of difficulties both in recruiting and retaining staff; 25 percent
of authorized positions (40 percent in highly skilled categories) in the
Public WTorks Department, which is responsible for carrying out almost half
of public sector investment, are presently vacant. As a result of these
difficulties, actual development expenditures under the First Malaysia Plan
were considerably lower than authorized.
10.      Malaysia's economic structure and growth pattern will continue
to be those of an export-oriented economy.  Therefore, a major factor
influencing her growth prospects will be, as it was in the past, the
trends in exports, which are primarily determined by Malaysia's past
investments and the world market situation. A commodity-by-commodity
analysis of export prospects suggests that the growth rates of both
export value and volume are likely to slow down considerably (from 5.3
and 7.2 percent p.a. respectively in 1966-70 to 4.1 and 6.1 percent in
1971-1975). It should nevertheless be possible for Malaysia to maintain
an annual CNP growth rate rate of 6-6.5 percent, provided investment can
be raised and production diversified. Import substitution both in manu-
facturing and agriculture is expected to continue, but its pace will
depend on the nature and magnitude of future Government assistance and
incentives to the private sector.
11.      The Second Malaysia Plan for 1971-75, which is being considered
by the Cabinet and will be submitted to Parliament in July, is to have as
a main objective a substantial increase in investment not only to accelerate
the growth of income and employment in the immediate future, but more
importantly to lay the basis for more rapid economic expansion in the
longer run. Potential opportunities for large investments exist; Malaysia
has extensive underdeveloped land, forestry and, possibly, mineral resources.
Further development of manufacturing, both for domestic and foreign markets,
should be possible.  Such a strategr would, however, require the strengthening
of the Government's agricultural and industrial policies and should emphasize
accelerated land development, replanting of remainin- smallholder rubber
land still covered with low-yielding species, increased research on annual
crops, the establishment of a more rational forestry policy, and a more
effective promotion of private investment and exports.
12.      The Government intends to support its development policy by a
significantly enlarged public investment program. Here, the overriding
constraint will continue to be the Governmentts limited planning and
implementation capacity for carrying out of the public investment program.
The Government is keenly aware of the general shortage of technical and
skilled manpower and is studying ways and means to cope with it. More
effective solutions must be found if the investment targets of the Second
Malaysia Plan are to be achieved.



13.      Availability of financial resources is not now a serious obstacle
to maintaining a real GNP growth of about 6 percent a year.  However,
public savings are low and this could become a problem if the Government
succeeded in improving its implementation capacity. The Government is
therefore considering additional taxation to make the revenue system
more responsive to income growth and to provide for new revenue sources
to finance growing public expenditures.
14.      If the Government succeeds in raising the investment level
significantly it is likely that the growth of imports, combined wirth the
expected slowdown in the growth of export earnings, will lead to a
moderate balance of payments deficit. As a result Malaysia wvould require
a substantially larger net inflow of official capital in the period
1971-75 than in the preceding five years.
15.      During the First Malaysia Plan period Malaysia had available
large amounts of external financing mainly in the form of bilateral lines
of credit or export credit guarantees, offered after the formation of the
Consultative Group in 1965-66. These have been utilized only to a limited
extent; of a total amount of about US$235 million offered, only about
US$105 million had been committed to specific projects and about US$60
million disbursed by the end of 1970. The reasons were twofold, a lack
of projects suitable for the kind of financing offered and unwillingness
of the Malaysian Government to use tied aid except after full international
competitive bidding. Progress on the part of aid-givers in untying aid,
and on the part of Malaysia in preparing projects, are therefore conditions
of a greater use of foreign aid during the Second Malaysia Plan period.
16.      Malaysia's outstanding external debt is small, US$380 million
(excluding undisbursed) at the end of 1970. The debt service ratio is
only 3 percent and is likely to remain between 3 and 5 percent throughout
the 1970's. Malaysia is creditworthy for substantial additional external
borrowings.
The Bank's Role
17.      A major problem in the implementation of the Seccnd Malaysia Plan
is, as has been noted, the lack of capacity in the public sector to prepare
and implement investment projects. The scope for outside assistance in
solving this problem is limited. The Bank has, however, played a role,
and plans to continue to do so, by giving such assistance in its lending
program and as Executing Agency for various UNDP-financed projects. In
the past year a number of missions, coordinated by the Bank, visited
Malaysia, including an economic mission with several sector specialists,
an agriculture sector mission and a UNESCO education sector mission, to
study and make recommendations on various aspects of the preparatory work
leading up to the formulation of the Second Malaysia Plan. The Bank has
also been the Executing Agency for the UNDP-financed General Transport
Survey which provided the basis for a number of transport projects which
have been incorporated in the new plan. Furthermore, the Bank will continue
in the future to initiate, and assist in the preparation of projects and
pre-investment studies and to finance consultants to improve the management
of project executing agencies.



- 5 -
18.      i-Malaysia's public investment program consists to a large extent
of small projects and projects with a small direct import content which
often makes them unattractive for financing by external aid sources. This
is particularly true in sectors such as education, agriculture and trans-
portation. It therefore appears unlikely that the flow of external
financing required can be achieved if all foreign loans are restricted
to financing the direct import content of specific projects.   The Bank
has in the past been prepared to finance a portion of local costs and
should continue to do so in appropriate cases. At the same time the
Bank should concentrate its lending on sectors and projects which are
not likely to attract commercial financing but which could benefit from
the Bank's help in project preparation and in strengthening the responsible
public agencies. These policies are reflected in the loans which I hope
to bring before you in the next year or so. The list will include loans
for agricultural credit, land settlement, education, railroads and highways.
I expect most of these loans to finance some element of local cost.
19.      As chairman of the oDnsultative Group the Bank has a special
interest in the coordination of technical and financial assistance to
Malaysia. The Group has not met since 1966, largely because, for reasons
mentioned above, only a small amount of the financing offered by members
of the Grou) has been utilized. In the meantime, useful cooperation has
developed between the Government, the Bank and other donors in the coordina-
tion of pre.-investment and lending activities. On the local level the
Government itself has been relatively successful in coordinating t;hese
activities. As soon as the Second Malaysia Plan has been coMpleted and
adopted, the Government and the Bank will consult about the advisability
of reconveningfl the Group.
P.RT III - THE SECTOR AIWD THE PROJIET
20.      Increased economic activity has made provision for an improved
and adequate telecommunications network a high priority. Although the
service in West Malaysia is good, the telephone network is generally
overloaded during business hours and waiting lists have continued to
grow. In East Malaysia only the main centers have been provided with
reasonable service; service elsewhere is very limited and the long
distance links are inadequate and often not up to acceptable standards.
21.      Since the formation of Malaysia in 1963, demand for local telephone
lines, taking? into account the increasing waiting list, has grown by 11
percent annually and usage of long-distance and international services has
increased by more than 15 percent per annum. The expansion and improvement
of telecommunications are an important objective of both the First Malaysia
Plan (1966-70) and the Second Malaysia Plan (1971-75).
22.      The First 11blaysia Plan included a total investment of US$68.7
million for expansion of telecommunications facilities. The program,
partly financed by a small Bank loan (560-MA) amounting to US$4-4 million,
was designed to satisfy the outstanding demand for local telephone and telex
facilities and to improve and extend long-distance and international facil-
ities. The completion of the program, however, has been somewhat delayed



- 6 -
because of slowness in ar:anging bilateral financing, in preparing
specifications and in allocauing budgetary funds. This is reflected
in the slow disbursements under Loan 560-Mh, of which US$4.06 million
remained undisbursed as at Alpril 30, 1971. Although contracts for the
full amount of the loan are now expected to be signed by the emd of
1971, and the project to be completed physically in early 19tI t'ie
Closing Date will probably have to be postponed by about 12 mc nths
to December 31, 1972. As a result of these delays part of tLe works
scheduled for completion during the First llalaysia Plan have had to
be carried over to the Second Malaysia Plan. Of a total investment
of US$115.9 million equivalent in the period 1971-75, US$21.9 million
represents the cost of on-going works brou-ht forward from the First
Plan. The balance of US$94 million, for new investment constitutes
the project and consists of:
1.  Telephone exchange equipment, subscribers' distribution
plant, including radio telephones, telephone apparatus,
associated sites and buildings, modernization of the
network and additions of about 80,000 additional
subscribers' lines.
2.  Extensions to the long distance network (mainly
microwave systems) by some 100,000 circuit miles.
3.. New and replacement international UHF and VHF systems
for services to Sumatra and Kalimantan; extension of
international multiplexing, and switching facilities.
4!. Connection of about 500 additional Telex and Gentex
subscribers and extension of the public telegraph
and leased circuit networks.
5. Construction of additional headquarters and stores
buildings, purchase of vehicles and miscellaneous
items.
23.       The foreign exchange component of the project is expected to
be US$47.3 mlillion equivalent, as set out in Annex III, of which the
proposed Bank loan would finance US$18.7 million equivalent.
24.       Total financial requirements of the Telecommunications Depart-
ment of Malaysia (TDM) during the period 1971-75 amount to about US$130
million including provisions for the 1971-75 investment program, commit-
ments for future capital works and a small increase in workingr capital.
To meet these requirements Malaysia expects to utilize, apart from the
undisbursed balance of Loan 560-MA and the proposed Bank loan, existing
suppliers' credits amounting to US$9.2 million and to obtain additional
suppliers' credits on reasonable terms in an amount of US$8.5 million
equivalent to finance the cost of microwave equipment. TDM will also
have at its disposal subscribers' deposits amounting to about US$14.1
million equivalent for capital expenditure. The balance of about
US$75.2 million will be financed through internal cash generation, after
an assumed payment to the Government's Consolidated Revenue Fund of
about US$26.7 million corresponding to a dividend of about 6% of the
Government's investment in TDM. A summary of the financing plan for the
1971-75 period is contained in Annex III.



-7-
25.      All equipment financed under the proposed loan will be procured
by international competitive bidding, with local manufacturers receiving
a preference of 15 percent or the actual customs duties, whichever is
lower, over the c.i.f. price of imported goods.
26.      The proceeds of the proposed loan will be disbursed against
the foreign exchange cost of the items listed in Anmex III, unless local
manufacturers succeed in securing some of the contracts, in which case the
full cost of items supplied by them will be financed from the loan.
Domestic manufacture is at the moment restricted to wire, small cables,
locally assembled vehicles and certain minor plant fittings. TDX has
indicated that there is a possibility of domestic manufacture being
extended to include telephone instruments and larger sized telephone
cables. Local cost financing is not likely to exceed US$1 million
equivalent.
27.      The TDM4, which will carry out the project, is a Department
of the Ministry of Works, Posts and Telecommunications and is responsible
for providing and operating a'l telecommunications facilities in lalaysia.
28.      TDM is headed by a Director General, and there are seven functional
departments responsible to him. The engineering and operational departments
are well run and efficient. Certain deficiencies in financial management
have been recognized, and legislation for setting up an independent tele-
communications fund and introducing a commercial accounting system was
approved in February 1971 with a view to alleviating these deficiencies.
The new accounting system is expected to be fully implemented by
December 31, 1972 as agreed in connection with Loan 560-MA.
29.      Although TLIH does not have commercial accounts yet, the available
financial data are sufficiently reliable to permit the judgment that its
financial position is strong. Between 1967 and 1970, TDM was able to earn
a return of about 10 percent on its net fixed assets in operation. During
1967-70, internally generated funds (net of debt service) provided 79 percent
of capital construction plus an increase in working capital. The high
proportion of self-financing of expansion is due to relatively high tariffs
and low amounts of debt service. The debt/equity ratio of TDM as at
December 31, 1970 was 11/89. Debt consisted mostly of suppliers' credits
incurred by Government on TDM's behalf.  All other Government contributions
are regarded as equity.
30.      TDM, assisted by contractors' installers, has the planning
engineering and supervisory capacity to carry out the program, and to
operate the network after installation. Training at the Telecommunications
Training Center or under equipment-supply contracts should be adequate to
provide for installation and subsequent maintenance and operation. In order
to meet its increasing responsibilities TDM will further improve its
organization, particularly in the coordination of its operational and
planning activities, and has engaged a firm of telecommunications con-
sultants (financed under the first Bank loan) for this purpose.



- 8 -
31.      The design of the existing local and long distance network is
based on earlier decisions to minimize expansion costs.   In 1967 TDM
standardized the use of a crossbar switching system. Main long-distance
routes were established using microwave equipment after comparing costs
on a present value basis of alternative schemes. The extensions to the
switching and long distance network now proposed flow logically frcm
these earlier decisions, and represent the least-cost solution. The
remaining major investment is in the local distribution network. Here
development is a continuous process, where the design, dimensioning
and programming of installations are done by planning engineers who
follow practices established to ensure the lowest cost on a present-
value basis.
32.      The internal financial rate of return is estimated at 15 percent.
The economic benefits to the users are expected to be considerably higher
in view of the fact that most of the telecommunications facilities are used
for business and administrative purposes. The project is therefore
economically sound.
PART V - LEGiL INSTRUMENTS AND AUTHORITY
33.      The draft Loan Agreement between Malaysia and the Bank, the
Report of the Committee provided for in Article III, Section 4(iii) of
the Articles of Agreement, and the text of a draft Resolution approving
the proposed loan are being distributed to the Executive Directors
separately. The draft Loan Agreement contains provisions usual for this
type of project.
3h.      I am satisfied that the proposed loan would comply with the
Articles of Agreement of the Bank.
PART VI - RECOMMENDATION
35.      I recommend that the Executive Directors approve the proposed
loan.
