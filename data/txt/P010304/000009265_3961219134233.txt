PAKISTAN
SECOND IRRIGATION SYSTEMS REHABILITATION PROJECT
(Cr. 1888-PAK)
Preface
This is the Implementation Completion Report (ICR) for the Second Irrigation
Systems Rehabilitation Project in Pakistan for which Credit 1888-PAK in the amount of
SDR 58.2 million" equivalent was approved on 29 March 1988 and made effective on 1 June
1989.
The credit was closed on 31 December 1995 after two one-year extensions. The last
disbursement was made on 2 July 1996, when about SDR 7.9 million was cancelled from the
credit. Co-finance was provided by USAID (about US$32.5 million was disbursed of the
US$95.3 million planned) and the Government of the Netherlands (only half of the 16 million
guilders planned was disbursed).
The ICR was prepared by a mission2' from the FAO/World Bank Cooperative
Programme that visited Pakistan in January and February 1996. Co-financiers, though invited to
join the mission, were unable to do so; a Dutch representative attended the mission's wrap-up
meeting in Islamabad.
The ICR is based on material in the project files and the mission's findings. The
borrower contributed by providing details of project implementation and discussion with the ICR
mission. The Borrower's views are given fully in Appendix B.

PAKISTAN
SECOND IRRIGATION SYSTEMS REHABILITATION PROJECT
(Cr. 1888-PAK)
Evaluation Summary
Introduction
The Government of Pakistan (GOP) water subsector policies were based on the
UNDP financed Indus Basin Study's report, "Revised Action Programme (RAP) for Irrigated
Agriculture", WAPDA (May 1979), which recommended numerous policy and institutional
improvements including privatization of public tubewells in fresh groundwater (FGW) areas and
placed investment priority on drainage, rehabilitation and water management. IDA has assisted
a number of projects (Table 2) in these priority areas including the Irrigation Systems
Rehabilitation Project (ISRP 1) (Cr. 1239-PAK) a forerunner of this Second Irrigation Systems
Rehabilitation Project (ISRP 2). Despite the policy reforms prior to the project and the essentially
correct investment priorities of GOP, a great deal remained to be done if the potential of the
agricultural sector was to be realized. The ISRP 2 was to address one important element of
GOP's agenda: further rehabilitation of the irrigation system throughout Pakistan to improve the
efficiency and equity of irrigation water deliveries.
Project Objectives
The project, which was to be implemented over five years (FY89-93) in four
provinces covering 4.1 million ha, was to rehabilitate over 13,000 km of irrigation canals and
1,300 km of drains as well as providing equipment, technical assistance and training. The primary
objectives of the project were to increase agricultural production, provide a more reliable and
equitable irrigation water supply to farmers and strengthen the capabilities of the Provincial
Irrigation Departments' (PIDs) operation and maintenance (O&M) programmes to improve
efficiency in systems operation and ensure adequate maintenance of installed facilities. In
addition, government undertook to remove subsidies on the costs of O&M of surface irrigation
and subsurface saline drainage and maintain levels of O&M funding in real terms. Costs of O&M
were to be fully recovered.
The primary objectives were clear and realistic, being similar to those in the
preceding ISRP 1. The project works, which consisted largely of deferred maintenance, were
simple and well within the capabilities of the implementing agencies to construct.



ii}
Implementation Experience and Results
Project works were less than estimated at appraisal, in part as a result of the early
withdrawal of USAID. About 10,000 km of canals were rehabilitated (about 75% of appraisal
projections) and about 1,200 km of drains (96%) (see Part II, Table 5). The PIDs estimate that
the area benefitted is 16% more than estimated at appraisal. Civil works costs were 19% below
appraisal estimates in US dollars (25% above them in rupees). Total project cost is now estimated
at US$132.2 million, 60% of the appraisal estimate in US dollars (90% in rupees). The cost of
civil works. Rs 2.845 million (US$104.6 million) with allowance for the costs of supervision,
adminiistration and some of the equipment, corresponds to about Rs 660 (US$24) per ha of the
irrigated area covered by the project. The agro-economic impact appears to be positive due to
prevention of losses in cropping intensity but there is insufficient evidence to quantify the
incremental production (see Appendix D). The project may not have increased the systems
potential agricultural production, but restored production levels to those existing when the systems
were in good operating condition. Reliability of water supply has been improved by reducing
the risk of breaches of canal banks and reducing seepage losses and increasing conveyance
ei'ficiency in sections of canals that have been lined. By restoring the discharge capacity of canals
and restoring outlets to their correct sizing, both equity and reliability of supply to watercourses,
particularly those near the tail end, have been improved. In addition crop losses due to floods and
waterlogging have been reduced by improving drains.
The capabilities of PIDs' O&M programmes have been strengthened (see para 9 of
Part l). In 1994/95, PIDs reported that they spent 84% of the target agreed with IDA for O&M
expenditure; only NWFP exceeded the target (by over 50%). As a result of covenants in the DCA
of this and other IDA-financed projects, water charge rates have been increased in nominal terms;
in real terms they have decreased in all provinces except in Balochistan (para 11). Moreover,
nationwide the amount of water charges assessed to water users was only 25% of the target for
O&M expenditure.
A key requirement for sustainability is a steady O&M regime with a reliable source
of fuLnding. This has not yet been achieved (para 22). The proposed future institutional changes,
whiereby Provincial Irrigation and Drainage Authorities (PIDAs) and Area Water Boards (AWBs)
would be created, are likely to result, at least in the short term, in considerable change and
unlcertainity concerniing funding. However the principles are sound, and if they are implemented
efficiently and PIDAs and AWBs are permitted to generate income and operate without external
interference, there is a good chance of their being able to sustain the rehabilitated canals and
drains.
Following delay in project effectiveness due to delay in USAID approving its Project
Documlaent and ECNEC approval, project implementation was delayed by slow GOP approval of
the project proposal documents and nationwide floods in 1988 and 1992, which diverted staff of
PlDs away from the project. Late supply of vehicles delayed scheme preparation in the early
stages of the project. The curtailment of assistance from USAID (no new commitments were
made after about 1990) severely reduced the amount of equipment provided, disrupted the benefit
nmonitorinig and evaluation programme and caused some civil works to be transferred to IDA. The



iv
transfer of works on the Upper Swat Canal system to an ADB project reduced the amount of
rehabilitation available in NWFP; consequently, the Dutch grant, which was restricted to NWFP,
was not fully used.
Despite the experience of ISRP 1, IDA failed to overcome many of the problems
which that project experienced. The covenants for recovery of O&M costs were complicated
(para 4) and, for the Punjab, were replaced with covenants in the Fordwah Eastern Sadiqia
(South) Irrigation and Drainage Project. In general, IDA otherwise performed satisfactorily and
adopted a flexible attitude to project implementation. IDA quickly agreed to GOP's request to
establish special accounts to ease the flow of funds for civil works construction. IDA temporarily
increased its disbursement percentage (from 80% to 90%) of costs of civil works to help GOP.
Because the Borrower failed to adequately observe credit covenants, IDA twice delayed the
announcement of the extension of credit closing date until near the actual closing date (para 19).
While this caused the Borrower some uncertainity and disruption to staffing, IDA could not agree
to extending closing dates until suitable action plans were in place.
The performance of the borrower has been variable. A considerable amount of work
has been satisfactorily completed despite early withdrawal of support from USAID: over 10,000
km of channels have been rehabilitated and the irrigated area benefitted by this project has been
estimated to be more than a quarter of all irrigation in Pakistan. The quality of construction has
generally been acceptable. However some targets have not been met due in part to inadequate
release of GOP funds; other reasons include initial delay in appointing staff and very frequent
transfers of staff. Poor quality of scheme preparation by provincial irrigation departments
indicates continued weakness of PIDs. Audit reports were often late and some found faults with
the accounts. Covenants regarding recovery of O&M costs were generally not complied with and
budget for O&M was lacking in Punjab, Sindh and Balochistan. The Borrower's lack of adequate
benefit monitoring makes it difficult to judge whether the project has achieved its major
objectives.
Sunimary of Findings, Future Operation and Key Lessons Learned
Pakistan has an immense investment in its irrigation system. Losing the fruits of that
investment by failing to maintain the system properly has immense costs. Provided that the Rs
660 (US$24)/ha spent on maintenance by this project was sensibly spent, even very small losses
avoided make that expenditure worthwhile. The evidence is that the works carried out by ISRP-2
were sensible works and were executed reasonably efficiently. Limited survey evidence suggests
that irrigators are right to value the project interventions, which they definitely do. The economic
return to project works is estimated to be around 17%, an acceptable result. Distributary and
minor canals in the project area, which account for about a quarter of the irrigated area of
Pakistan, which had deteriorated due to lack of maintenance, were restored to good operating
condition under the project. Some drains were also improved. Future operation of these canals
and drains will depend on the success of the plan to establish PIDAs and AWBs. Although the
removal of subsidies for O&M of surface irrigation and subsurface saline drainage has not yet
been achieved, the overall outcome of the project is considered satisfactory.



v
Lessons from this project include that it is impossible to estimate the benefits of such
irrigation and drainage development without carrying out agro-economic monitoring and
evaluation - a subject to which the borrower attaches insufficient importance. When irrigation
department officials are not able to enforce canal operation rules, the benefits of efficient and
equitable distribution of water are lost. Frequent transfers of staff disrupt and delay project
implementation. Sustaining Pakistan's irrigation systems requires to develop beneficiary-oriented,
autonomous. commercially-oriented public utilities in tandem with more positive participatory
management by beneficiaries. The on-going Government's transformation of PIDs into PIDAs
and AWBs, along with formation of Water Users' Associations (WUAs) needs to be promoted.






IMPLEMENTATION COMPLETION REPORT
PAKISTAN
SECOND IRRIGATION SYSTEMS REHABILITATION PROJECT
(Cr. 1 888-PAK)
PART I: PROJECT IMPLEMENTATION ASSESSMENT
A. STATEMENT/EVALUATION OF OBJECTIVES
1.         The project aimed at covering 4.1 million ha in all four provinces over a five-year
(FY89-93) implementation period and was to rehabilitate designated surface irrigation and surface
drainage systems that had deteriorated from lack of maintenance (58% of project costs). The
project was also to provide for required equipment and related facilities (17%) as well as
technical assistance (7%), training (6%), and project supervision and administration (12%).
2.         The primary objectives of the project were to:
(a)    increase agricultural production by (i) providing a more reliable water
supply, reducing the risk of failure and removing physical constraints in the
irrigation network, and (ii) reducing crop losses resulting from rain
flooding by improving the surface drainage system;
(b)    provide a more equitable irrigation water supply to farmers by increasing
deliveries to water-deficient chaks mainly located in the lower reaches of
minors and distributaries, through a programme of silt removal and
redesign of selected channels and outlets; and
(c)    strengthen the capabilities of the Provincial Irrigation Departments' (PIDs)
operation and maintenance (O&M) programme to improve efficiency in
systems operation and ensure adequate maintenance of installed facilities.
3.         In addition as part of the project, government undertook to remove subsidies for the
costs of operation and maintenance of surface irrigation and subsurface saline drainage. Full
recovery of O&M costs was to be achieved by I July 1997 at the latest; public tubewells in fresh
groundwater areas were to be phased out by 30 June 1998. The levels of O&M funding in
FY1988 were to be maintained in real terms.
4.         The primary objectives were clear and realistic, being similar to those in the
preceding Irrigation Systems Rehabilitation Project (Cr. 1239-PAK). The project works, which
I



consisted largely of deferred maintenance, were simple and well within the capabilities of the
implementing agencies to construct. The covenants regarding recovery of O&M costs were
complicated. In recognizing the difficulties of moving towards full recovery of O&M costs, the
covenants included a degree of flexibility in the rate at which provinces would move towards this
objective. In practice this could have been misunderstood as placing a premium on slow progress:
the larger the shortfall at July 1, 1992, the longer the time then allowed to meet the target".
These covenants were politically sensitive for the Borrower and there was a reluctance to observe
them. Other than suspending disbursement, IDA's sole remaining sanction was refusal to extend
the credit closing dates. The requirement to maintain the FY1988 level of O&M funding was
realistic.
B. ACHIEVEMENT OF OBJECTIVES
5.         The project rehabilitated over 10,000 km of canals (about 75% of the SAR target)
and over 1,200 km of drains (about 96% of target) (Table 5). However, the irrigated land
benefitting from these works has been estimated to be 4,810,000 ha (116% of target) Reasons for
the shortfall in length of canal include withdrawal of USAID, transfer of Upper Swat system to
ADB and inadequate funds (para 28). A reason for the apparent increase in area benefitting is that
the whole area served by a canal has been claimed even though in some cases only part of the
length of the canal was rehabilitated under the project. While this may not be the correct way
to calculate the benefitted area, it will not effect the method used to re-estimate the project's
economic rate of return.
6.         Total project cost is now estimated at US$132.2 million, 60% of the appraisal
estimate in US dollars (90% in rupees). Civil works costs were 19% below appraisal estimates
in US dollars but 25% higher in rupee terms (Table 8A). The amounts spent for equipment and
training were substantially less than estimated at appraisal. The cost of civil works, Rs 2,845
million (US$104.6 million) corresponds to about Rs 600/ha (US$22/ha). If allowance is made for
the costs of supervision, administration and some of the equipment, this would rise to about Rs
660 (US$24) per ha of irrigated area covered by the project.
7.         There is insufficient evidence available to the mission to quantify accurately changes
in agricultural production due to the project. The project provided that agricultural benefits be
monitored every six months2". Agro-economic post-rehabilitation results, based on one-time
results, are available for only three of eight areas for which benchmark surveys were made. The
validity of these three is compromised. Two do not provide for a "control" area where project
works were not undertaken, so it is not known whether reported changes stem from the project
or not. One of these is for a distributary for which water delivered at the head has always been.
and still is, substantially less than the design duty. As well, the water supply is unreliable,
however well the distributary has been rehabilitated, it could not perform close to expectations.
The other shows substantial losses, following project-financed improvements, resulting from a
canal breach and costly flooding. The post-rehabilitation survey with a "control" area (Venoi in
1I         See Table 10 (DCA Section 4.03 (b) and (d)) and SAR, para 6.17 (e) and (f).
2          SAR refers to biennual reports. The ICR assumes that this means biannual and not biennual.
2



Punjab) used a sample different from and rather unlike the baseline sample. This last and most
credible survey indicates that farmers on the rehabilitated distributary almost maintained their
cropping intensity and farm incomes, whereas those on the non-project control distributary
suffered an 8% drop in cropping intensity over five years. The net drop in cropping intensity
avoided due to the project was 7.3% over five years or 1.4% per year. Figures for net farm
income per hectare are similar (see Appendix D, para 7). The economic analysis (Appendix D)
explores different assumptions and finds the most plausible one that these survey findings from
the Venoi dsitributary are representative of the project as a whole.
8.         Reliability of water supply has been improved by reducing the risk of breaches of
canal banks and reducing seepage losses in sections of canals that have been lined. By restoring
the discharge capacity of canals and restoring outlets to their correct sizing, both equity and
reliability of supply to watercourses, particularly those near the tail end, have been improved.
However, sometimes gains have subsequently been lost due to farmers tampering with outlets.
Moreover, the benefit of improving water delivery at the tail end of canals will only lead to
incremental increases in production where the water would otherwise not have been used at the
head end. Since this is by no means always the case, the tail end gains in production may be
partially offset by some loss of output at the head end. Reduction in seepage losses could also
be argued to result in less groundwater recharge, although reduced percolation in the canal would
be largely compensated by increased recharge from the fields in which the water is eventually
applied. Crop losses due to floods and waterlogging have been reduced by improving drains.
9.         The capabilities of PIDs' O&M programmes have been strengthened by training, use
of computers provided by the project, improvements in mechanical workshops and development
of manuals. Overhaul of construction equipment and improvements in PID workshops increased
PIDs' access to equipment needed for maintenance. Supervision missions from IDA repeatedly
reported that the targeted budgets for O&M were not being provided and reported some
unsatisfactory maintenance and deterioration of rehabilitated channels and drains.
10.        In 1994/95, PIDs reported that they spent 84% of the amount targeted" for O&M
expenditure; only NWFP exceeded the target (by over 50%). During the project, water charge
rates in the Punjab have been increased by 51% (from 1988 to 1995); for Sindh, Balochistan and
NWFP, the increases have been 15%, 136% and 95%, respectively'. Moreover, nationwide the
amount of water charges assessed to water users was only 25% of the target and the amount
recovered (86% of the assessment3") was 22% of the target or 26% of the amount spent on
O&M. Provinces are currently increasing water charge rates above the 1995 level: 33% in
Punjab and Balochistan, 25% in Sindh and 205% in NWFP. Although some progress has been
made towards recovering the costs of O&M, it is unlikely that full recovery will be achieved by
1997. Various factors account for poor performance: (a) currently water charges are not linked
directly to O&M needs and they are collected by the Provincial Revenue Departments and are
The target is based on maintaining the FY1988 levels of O&M funding in real terms.
Although most of these appear substantial, in real terms they are mostly negative: -34%, -50%,
+3% and -15%, respectively.

deemed to be part of provincial revenues; (b) funds allocated to PIDs by provincial governments
are insufficient for proper O&M and this, coupled with inadequate institutional capability of
PIDs, has caused unsatisfactory delivery of water to farmers; and (c) as such, farmers are not
willing to pay their water charges although the current rates are still set significantly below those
levels needed to recover O&M expenditures. However, studies conducted under this project, and
preparation work for the National Irrigation Program Project, show that about 67% of current
actual O&M expenditures go towards staff salaries, and only 33% is spent on O&M works.
These works expenditures may only meet some 30% of actual needs. Under the current
institutional arrangements water charges would have to be set at unrealistic levels to provide
adequate funds for an appropriate level of actual O&M works.
11.        While the project has not fully met its objective of ensuring adequate maintenance
of installed facilities, it has moved the Government considerably towards solving the issues of
sustainably maintaining its irrigation and drainage systems. The project has had two major
impacts. Firstly, it established a framework under which PIDs could monitor the levels of O&M
expenditures and water charge recoveries. Secondly, project and other studies allowed the
Government and Bank to see the actual on-ground situation regarding the adequacy and
composition of O&M expenditures and recovery rate of water charges, and provided the basis for
a major change in strategy towards solving the problems. As already said (para 10), these studies
showed that just raising water charges would be most unlikely to generate sufficient O&M funds
to meet necessary O&M expenditures. Considerable institutional change is also required,
including developing autonomous, beneficiary and commercially-oriented public utilities,
decentralizing management of a considerable portion of the irrigation systems to the beneficiaries,
instituting individual water rights and establishing legal water markets. In line with this, for the
upcoming National Drainage Program Project the Government is now transforming PIDs into
PIDAs and AWBs.
12.        As covenanted under the project's Development Credit Agreement (DCA), the
Government has moved to privatize public tubewells in fresh groundwater areas. This will reduce
future overall O&M expenditures. While progress has been slower than hoped for, the
Government has mainly met DCA covenants concerning privatization of public tubewells. As
well, Government appears to be fully committed to completing the privatization program.
13.        The economic rate of return has been re-estimated to be about 17% compared with
31% estimated at appraisal. However, this is indicative only, being based on inadequate data, and
assumes the project would prevent a progressive loss of cropping intensity of 1.5 % per year over
a five year period, as detailed in Appendix D. The economic rate of return calculation does not
take account of any institutional development benefits resulting from the project.

C. MAJOR FACTORS AFFECTING THE PROJECT
Factors not Generally Subject to Government Control
14.        Following delay in project effectiveness due to delay in USAID approving its Project
Document (approved in February 1989) and ECNEC approval, project implementation was
delayed by nationwide floods in 1988 and again in 1992, which diverted the staff of PIDs away
from the project. Late supply of vehicles from USAID delayed scheme preparation in the early
stages of the project.
15.        The curtailment of assistance from USAID (no new commitments were made after
about 1990) severely reduced the amount of equipment provided, disrupted the benefit monitoring
and evaluation programme and caused some civil works, which were to have been financed by
USAID, to be transferred to IDA.
16.       The law and order situation in Sindh was reported by supervision missions to have
adversely affected progress in Sindh, but at the ICR mission wrap-up meeting the mission was
informed that this was not, significant.
Factors Generally Subject to Government Control
17.        The start of project implementation was delayed by about one year due to slow
ECNEC approval of the internal project proposal documents. The transfer of works on the Upper
Swat Canal system to an ADB project reduced the amount of rehabilitation work required to be
done in NWFP which conformed to the project guidelines; consequently, the Dutch grant was not
fully used.
18.       The late and sometimes inadequate provision of funds to the provinces severely
affected the amount of work that could be done during the short working seasons governed by
canal closures.
19.        Failure to fully observe credit covenants delayed construction of works (covenants
concerning adequate project funding and procurement procedures), and caused difficulties in
trying to solve cost recovery issues and meeting the project's cost recovery objectives. IDA
would not agree to extending the credit closing date until the provinces made suitable progress
towards meeting the cost recovery covenants.
Factors Generally Subject to Implementing Agency Control
20.        Preparation of schemes was often delayed due to the PID staffs' unfamiliarity with
project requirements and preoccupation with other duties. This was exacerbated in Sindh and
particularly in NWFP by frequent transfers of staff which resulted in reluctance to learn the
required procedures because of the likelihood of imminent transfer and loss of knowledge of
those who had learned but were then transferred. However, the supervising consultants performed
well and improved scheme preparation, particulary in the case of Sindh, where consultants' staff
5



were seconded to the Irrigation Department for this purpose. Only in the Punjab was a Project
Cell established, specifically for this project, which worked well with good continuity of staff.
21.        The procurement process for civil works was often prolonged with many cases
where several retenders were needed. The works were carried out by a very large number of
small contracts. This resulted in excessive paperwork and tedious approval processes. Contractors
often lacked technical ability, equipment and finance and disregarded the terms of the contract.
Most contracts, though of short duration to fit into the canal closure period, were completed late.
Some contracts were abandoned by the contractors4".
D. PROJECT SUSTAINABILITY
22.        A key requirement for sustainability is a steady O&M regime with a reliable source
of funding. This has not yet been achieved5"; the proposed institutional changes, whereby PIDAs
and AWBs would be created, are likely to result, at least in the short term, in considerable change
and uncertainty concerning funding. However the principles are sound; if they are implemented
efficiently and PIDAs and AWBs are permitted to generate income and operate without external
interference, there is a good chance of their being able to sustain the rehabilitated canals and
drains. As a result of covenants in the DCA of this and other IDA-financed projects, water charge
rates have been increased and further increases are being implemented.
23.        The project financed the construction of a building for the International Irrigation
Management Institute (IIMI), Pakistan. Maintenance of the building and operation of IIMI are
the responsibility of IIMI, which is supported by international donors, and are likely to be
sustained.
E. IDA PERFORMANCE
24.        Identification and preparation of the project assumed that the project would be
modelled, in many respects, on ISRP I (Cr. 1239-PAK) but with some modifications to achieve
improved O&M and greater assurance and equity in the distribution of irrigation water. Whole
systems or subsystems (such as a distributary canal) were to be rehabilitated rather than just the
most urgently needed works in a system as was done in ISRP 1. Systems were to be redesigned,
as necessary, to improve deliveries and reduce O&M costs, with concrete or masonry lining
provided on selected reaches of minors and small distributaries. IDA contracted local consulting
engineers to prepare a feasibility report for the project. There was a delay of about a year
between the feasibility report and Board presentation, due mainly to lack of progress on agreeing
on a proposed schedule for subsidy reduction. IDA's new SCARP transition strategy, which was
designed to reduce O&M costs, opened the way for renewing the dialogue on cost recovery.
Project design included reasonable provisions for project monitoring and evaluation.
41         About 10 contracts in the Punjab and 2 in Sindh.
However, in NWFP finance made available for O&M has exceeded the target.
6



25.         IDA's performance during project preparation and appraisal was generally
satisfactory. In retrospect the project objective of "ensuring adequate maintenance of installed
facilities" was over ambitious. However project design included a framework for monitoring and
comparing O&M expenditures and cost recovery levels; funds for undertaking several studies of
ways to improve assessment and collection of water charges and reduce Government involvement
in O&M expenditures; and the splitting of O&M expenditures for Government operated
groundwater irrigation from O&M expenditures for surface water irrigation. This last point
narrowed the project's adequate maintenance objective to dealing mainly with surface water
irrigation. The covenants for recovery of O&M costs were complicated (para 4), and, for the
Punjab, were replaced with covenants in the Fordwah Eastern Sadiqia (South) Irrigation and
Drainage Project.
26.         During project implementation IDA generally performed satisfactorily and showed
adequate flexibility. It maintained close cooperation with implementing agencies and co-
financiers. In retrospect the agreement to restrict the Dutch Grant to NWFP resulted in a
substantial portion of the grant not being used; this was due mainly to the transfer by NWFP of
most of the Upper Swat Canal system, in which many suitable schemes for rehabilitation had
been identified, to an ADB project. Had the Dutch Grant Agreement been amended to allow for
its use in Balochistan as well, the grant might have been more fully used. Although the
probability of not using the entire grant was recognised quite early in the project, no agreement
was reached on its alternative use6'. Following the onset of GOP's financial stringency, GOP
requested and IDA quickly agreed to the establishment of special accounts to ease the flow of
funds for civil works construction. These functioned well in three provinces; by the time
agreement had been obtained from the Netherlands for a special account in NWFP, the credit
closing date was about six months away and the special account was never filled. IDA
temporarily increased its disbursement percentage (from 80% to 90%) of costs of civil works to
help GOP overcome the effects of the Gulf war. When it became obvious that simply raising
water charges and improving PID's efficiency would not solve O&M problems, IDA moved the
Government to develop a more appropriate strategy as outlined in the new long-term irrigation
and drainage strategy (Pakistan's Irrigation and Drainage Issues and Options, March 25, 1994).
27.         There was reasonable continuity of IDA staff on supervision missions but the
implementing agencies would have preferred more intensive supervision, with more people for
longer times concentrating on one project only. After 1992, some delay was reported in receiving
IDA's agreement for scheme proposals when these had to be sent to Washington for approval".
The very large number of small contracts contributed to the delay.8' Supervision missions failed
to make the Borrower complete benefit monitoring in time for the ICR mission.
During the ICR wrap-up meeting, the Federal Coordinator asked the representative of the
Government of the Netherlands to consider using unused grants funds to support monitoring and
evaluation.
71          Before 1992 scheme proposals were reviewed by engineering staff in RMP.
xi          Despite IDA's advice to package several small works in to fewer and larger contracts, PIDs preferred
smaller contracts, primarily to avoid IDA's prior review of procurement documentation and decisions.
7



F. BORROWER PERFORMANCE
28.        The performance of the Borrower has been variable. A considerable amount of work
lhas been satisfactorily completed despite early withdrawal of support from USAID: over 11,000
kmi of clhanniels have beeni relhabilitated and the irrigated area covered by this project has been
estimated to be more thani a quarter of all irrigation in Pakistan. The quality of construction has
genierally beeni acceptable. However some targets have not been met due in part to inadequate
release of GOP fuinds; other reasons include initial delay in appointing staff and very frequent
transfers of staff, particularly in NWFP but also in Sindh'". Other than in Punjab, where staff
were assigned fiull-time to the project, work was given to staff who had many other duties and
found the requirements of work associated with IDA finance more onerous than they were used
to. This resulted in a lack of staff enthusiasm for the project and those who had learned the new
procedures were often transferred before their knowledge had been put to much good use.
29.         Poor quality of scheme preparation by provincial irrigation departments, which
required careftil review by consultants and IDA staff, indicates continued weakness of PIDs and
suggests that this somewhat specialized work is best carried out either by pro ject cells established
t'or the purpose or by consultants. IDA and the supervisory consultants conducted several training
courses in procurement and disbursements but due to frequent PID staff turn over the benefits
were marginal.
30.        Audit reports were often late and some found faults with the accounts. Covenants
regarding recovery of O&M costs were generally not complied with and budget for O&M was
lacking in Punjab, Sindh and Balochistan. Benefit monitoring was inadequate.
3 1 .      The mission confirmed findings of the project's monitoring unit concerning
tampering with outlets and theft of water on a few channels. This negates the good effects of the
works financed by the project. In most cases influential farmers tamper outlets in connivance with
the PID staff. What is needed is greater farmer participation in, and control over, the distribution
of water.
G. ASSESSMENT OF OUTCOME
32.        In the absence of adequate benefit monitoring the extent of the project's
achievements of its major objectives of increased agricultural production and providing more
equitable water supplies to farmers is unclear. However, losing the fruits of Pakistan's immense
inivestment in its irrigation system by failing to maintain the system properly has immense costs.
IProvided that the Rs 660 (US$24)/ha spent on deferred maintenance by this project was sensibly
spent, even very small losses avoided make that expenditure worthwhile. The evidence is that the
works carried out by ISRP-2 were sensible works, executed well and reasonably efficiently. The
limited survey evidence suggests that irrigators are right to value the project interventions, which
they definitely do. Based on assumptions detailed in Appendix D, the economic return to project

at least six of his predecessors.
8



works is estimated at about 17%, an acceptable result. Irrigation departments have been
strengthened by the provision of equipment and training; the experience gained with the project
unit in the Punjab is valuable. Although the removal of government subsidies for the costs of
O&M of surface irrigation and subsurface saline drainage has not yet been achieved, the overall
outcome of the project can be considered satisfactory.
H. FUTURE OPERATION
33.        A plan of operation (Attachment 1 to Appendix A) was discussed and agreed by the
last IDA supervision mission in November 1995. Once PIDAs are formed, which could occur
around end-1996, this plan of operation should be developed and refined to suit the new
organizations and the collection of water fees and payment of them to PIDAs. Responsibilities
for the duties outlined in the plan should then be assigned. Performance indicators which should
be monitored include: (i) area commanded by irrigation works, area assessed for payment of
irrigation fees, area which pays irrigation fees and assessed area that does not pay and the reasons
for non-payment recorded; (ii) amount of irrigation and drainage charges assessed, waived and
paid; (iii) amount spent on O&M of irrigation and drainage works broken down into:
establishment, energy for pumping, works and other; and (iv) amount of irrigation and drainage
charges paid as a percentage of amount spent on O&M. Although these indicators are all readily
available, they are not regularly recorded and evaluated.
34.        If necessary, to further assess the benefits from this type of project, the Bank could
now review in detail the results and the rigour of the Venoi distributary evaluation, which the
Government has recently completed. The Bank could also commission follow-up surveys of the
four Punjab benchmarks for additional data.
I. KEY LESSONS LEARNED
35.        Sustaining Pakistan's irrigation systems requires to develop beneficiary- oriented,
autonomous, commercially- oriented public utilities in tandem with more positive participatory
management by beneficiaries. The on-going Government's transformation of the PIDs into
PIDAs and AWBs in tandem with formation of Water Users' Associations (WUAs) needs to be
promoted.
36.        Delay in project start-up (15 months from Board to Effectiveness) was due to delay
in ECNEC approval and delay in USAID approval. Both the Government and cofinancier should
have expedited the procedure. Cross-effectiveness conditions are by necessity included in all co-
financed projects, especially where one co-financier is financing the TA for all project
components. It could be argued that IDA should have financed a part of the TA and thus avoided
cross-effectiveness.
37.        It is impossible to estimate the benefits of irrigation and drainage development
without carrying out agro-economic monitoring and evaluation. This appears to be a subject to
which the Borrower, possibly due to budgetary constraints, attaches insufficient importance.
9



Agro-economic evaluation needs to extend beyond the end of the project, after the supply of
external funds has ceased. Adequate funds should therefore be made available from GOP to
suitable organizations in Pakistan to carry out this work. This could be encouraged by a covenant
in the credit agreement requiring that a contract for baseline and follow-up surveys, which may
extend beyond the end of the externally financed project, be awarded during the project, financed
by donors or by government.
38.        There still remain much to be improved in technical ability of small contractors.
Some of the poor quality of construction work was largely due to their lack of ability.

SAR made estimates in Rs converted at Rs 17.5/US$ except for price contingencies which were
converted to US$ at an average of about Rs 35.2/US$, i.e. the price contingencies in the Rs estimate
of cost were totally based on assumed local inflation rates, whereas the price contingencies in the US$
estimate of cost were totally based on assumed foreign inflation rates.
2' The ICR has based actual costs on Rs expenditure except for USAID costs, which have been estimated
in US$ and converted to Rs at actual average annual exchange rates. The Rs total cost was then
converted to US$ using the same exchange rates.
-' Estimated actual costs for USAID in ISRP 2 are based on a figure supplied by Federal Coordinators
office of US$32.51 million and mission's estimates of the breakdown of this figure. The split of the total
amount spent by USAID (US$1 17.3 million) between ISRP 1 and ISRP 2 is unclear. However,
deducting the amount given for ISRP 1 in the PCR for that project (US$103.0 million) would leave only
US$14.3 million for ISRP 2. USAID, Islamabad, gave the mission a figure of US$81.6 million spent
after 1 July 1988; however, it is likely that ISRP 2 related expenditures actually began later than 1988.

assessment
Recovery in the Punjab includes Rs 165 million recovered from earlier years.
Targets for O&M expenditure are well exceeded in NWFP, are close to being met in the Punjab
and Balochistan but fall short in Sindh. Recoveries of O&M expenditures from water users are
pitiful due to low levels of assessment and collection.
Project Implementation
12.         The project has nearly met the target for length of drain to be improved but has
failed to meet its targets for lengths of canals to be rehabilitated and improved. PIDs claim to
have exceeded the targets for land benefitting from improved irrigation and drainage as shown
below.

Note: These are preliminary figures and slight variations are to be expected.
13.         The procurement process for civil works was often prolonged with many cases
where several retenders were needed. The works were carried out by a very large number of
small contracts. This resulted in excessive paperwork and tedious approval processes.
Contractors often lacked technical ability, equipment and finance and disregarded the terms of



5
the contract. Most contracts, though of short duration to fit into the canal closure period, were
completed late. Some contracts were abandoned by the contractors" .
14.        Provinces have increased their rates of water charges as shown below in annual and
cumulative percentages above the 1988 rates:
ACTUAL                                  PLAN

The cumulative increases to date show that Balochistan and NWFP have already more than
doubled their water charges from low bases in 1988 but that the increases in the Punjab and
Sindh have been more modest. However, even when all the planned increases have taken effect
the amount assessed is unlikely to exceed one third of the target for O&M allocation except
possibly in NWFP for which details of assessment are not yet available.
Major Factors Affecting the Project
15.        The start of project implementation was seriously delayed by (a) delay of one year
in ECNEC approval of PC-Is, (b) serious floods in 1988, which diverted the staff of PIDs away
from the project, and (c) delay in USAID approving its Project Document (approved in February
1989).
16.        The curtailment of assistance from USAID (no new commitments were made after
about 1990) severely reduced the amount of equipment provided, disrupted the benefit
monitoring and evaluation programme and caused some civil works, which were to have been
financed by USAID, to be transferred to IDA. Floods in 1988 and 1992 delayed progress.
17.        The transfer by NWFP of works on the Upper Swat Canal system to an ADB project
reduced the amount of rehabilitation available in NWFP which conformed to the project
guidelines.
18.        Preparation of schemes was often delayed due to the unfamiliarity with project
requirements of staff of PIDs and, initially, by late supply (July 1990) of vehicles from USAID.
' About 10 conitracts in the Punjab and 2 in Sindh.

Project Sustainability
19.         Key requirement for sustainability is a steady-state post-completion O&M  regime
with a reliable source of funding. This has not been achieved" and the proposed institutional
changes, whereby Provincial Irrigation and Drainage Authorities (PIDAs) and Area Water
Boards (AWBs) would be created, are likely to result, at least in the short term, in considerable
change and uncertainty concerning funding. However the principles are sound; if they are
implemented efficiently and PIDAs and AWBs are permitted to generate income and operate
without external interference, there is a good chance of their being able to sustain the
rehabilitated canals and drains.
20.         The project also financed the construction of a building for the International
Irrigation Management Institute (IIMI), Pakistan. Maintenance of the building and operation of
IIMI are the responsibility of IIMI, which is supported by international donors, and are likely
to be sustained.
Performance of IDA
21.         In general IDA performed satisfactorily and adopted a flexible attitude to project
implementation. It maintained close cooperation with implementing agencies and co-financiers.
In retrospect the agreement to restrict the Dutch Grant to NWFP resulted in a substantial portion
of the grant not being used; this was due mainly to the transfer by NWFP of most of the Upper
Swat Canal system, in which many suitable schemes for rehabilitation had been identified, to an
ADB project." Had the Dutch Grant been eligible for use in Baluchistan as well, it might have
been fully used. Although the probability of not using the entire grant was recognised quite
early in the project, no agreement was reached on alternative use for the grant31. Following the
onset of GOP's financial stringency, GOP requested and IDA quickly agreed to establish special
accounts to ease the flow of funds for civil works construction. These functioned well in three
provinces; by the time agreement had been obtained from the Netherlands for a special account
in NWFP the credit closing date was about six months away and the special account was never
filled. IDA temporarily increased its disbursement percentage (from 80% to 90%) of costs of
civil works to help GOP.
22.         The covenants for recovery of O&M  costs were not clear (para 6) and, for the
Punjab, were replaced with covenants in the Fordwah Eastern Sadiqia (South) Irrigation and
Drainage Project. Covenants required provinces to increase water charges but did not specifically
require the increased charges to be collected.
" However, funding in NWFP has exceeded the target.
2, Contributing factors included the need to then identify new schemes for inclusioni in the project and delay hi
aninouncing extensions of credit closing dates (in about November 1993 and 1994), which did not allow time to select
schemes and procure contractors betbre the January/February construction window.
' During the ICR wrap-up meeting the Federal Coordinator asked the representative of the Government of the
Netherlanlds to consider using unused grant funds for monitorinig and evaluation.



7
23.        There was reasonable continuity of IDA staff on supervision missions but the
implementing agencies would have preferred more intensive supervision, with more people for
longer times concentrating on one project only. After 1992, some delay was reported in
receiving IDA's agreement for scheme proposals when these had to be sent to Washington for
approval. The very large number of small contracts contributed to the delay. Supervision
missions failed to make the borrower complete benefit monitoring in time for the ICR mission.
Borrower Performance
24.       The performance of the borrower has been variable. A considerable amount of work
has been satisfactorily completed despite early withdrawal of support from USAID: over 11,000
km of channels have been rehabilitated and the irrigated area benefitted by this project has been
estimated to be more than a quarter of all irrigation in Pakistan. The quality of construction has
generally been acceptable. However some targets have not been met due in part to inadequate
release of GOP funds; other reasons include initial delay in appointing staff and very frequent
transfers of staff, particularly in NWFP but also in Sindh". Other than in Punjab, where staff
were assigned full-time to the project, work was done by staff who had many other duties and
found the requirements of work associated with IDA finance more onerous than they were used
to. This resulted in lack of enthusiasm for work on the project. Once staff learned the new
procedures they were likely to be transferred before their knowledge had been put to much good
use.
25.        Lack of observance of covenants, particularly those relating to cost recovery, made
IDA reluctant to extend the credit closing date until some progress towards compliance was
made. This delayed the announcement of the extension until near the closing date, thus causing
uncertainty, lack of funds (the special accounts were already well drawn down prior to closing),
disruption to staffing and delay in implementation. The agro-economic impact of the project was
given insufficient attention.
26.        The mission found evidence of tampering with outlets and theft of water, which
negates the good effects of the works financed by the project. Irrigation Department officials are
handicapped in enforcing canal rules and should be given sufficient support to ensure that canal
rules are observed.
Assessment of the Outcome
27.        The World Bank guidelines for ICRs require the report to assess the project's likely
outcome. Lack of adequate benefit monitoring makes it impossible to know whether the project
has achieved its major objectives of increased agricultural production and providing more
equitable water supplies to farmers. Irrigation departments have been strengthened by the

six ot his predecessors.

provision of equipment and training; the experience gained with the project unit in the Punjab
is valuable. However the support for the removal of government subsidies for the costs of O&M
of surface irrigation and subsurface saline drainage has not been successful. The implementing
agencies consider the project to be satisfactory. The ICR mission considers the outcome
uncertain at this stage; it will depend largely on the result of the economic re-evaluation.
Future Operation
28.        A plan of operation (Attachment 1) was discussed and agreed by the last IDA
supervision mission in November 1995. Once PIDAs are formed, which is planned for 1 July
1996. this plan of operation should be developed and refined to suit the new organisations.
Responsibilities for the duties outlined in the plan should then be assigned.
Lessons Learned
29.       It is impossible to estimate the benefits of irrigation and drainage development
without carrying out agro-economic monitoring and evaluation. This appears to be a subject to
which the borrower attaches insufficient importance, due to budgetary constraints. Agro-
economic evaluation needs to extend beyond the end of the project, after the supply of external
funds has ceased. Adequate funds should therefore be made available from GOP to suitable
organisations in Pakistan to carry out this work. This could be encouraged by a covenant in the
credit agreement requiring that a contract for baseline and follow-up surveys, which may extend
beyond the end of externally financed project, is awarded during the project, even though not
necessarily financed by external funds.
30.        Efficient and equitable operation of irrigation schemes requires adherence to canal
operation rules. When irrigation department officials are not able to enforce the rules, as
sometimes seems to be the case, the benefits of more equitable distribution of water, which have
been obtained by this project, are lost.
31.       IDA's policy of closing special accounts six months before credit closing date can
cause serious financial problems for the implementing agencies.
32.        Frequent transfers of staff disrupt and delay project implementation.
C. Follow-Up
33.        The mission will return to Rome and prepare a draft ICR in accordance with World
Bank guidelines. It is planned to despatch this to Washington in early March 1996. IDA will
then transmit the draft ICR to the borrower and co-financiers for comment.
34.        The borrower is encouraged to complete within three months of this ICR mission
an evaluation of project implementation. Advice for preparing this is given in Attachment 2.

Attachment 1: Operation Plan
Based on the decisions taken in the high level meeting held in August 1995 on
institutional reforms in the irrigation and drainage sector, the Provincial Irrigation Departments
(PIDs), which have long been in charge of operation and maitenance of irrigation and drainage
facilities, are scheduled to be transformed into Provincial Irrigation and Drainage Authorities
(PIDAs) by July 1, 1996. The PIDAs will be financially and operationally autonomous bodies
and will have independent revenue collection and spending authority. Below the PIDAs,
financially self-accounting Area Water Boards (AWBs) will be created preferably around canal
commands. Below the AWBs levels, farmers will be encouraged to form Water Users
Formations (WUFs) at the distributary and minor level. The WUFs would play an important role
in the operation and maintenance of of distributaries and minors using " Participatory Irrigation
Management (PIM) " approach.
Operation and maintenance of the rehabilitated irrigatin and drainage facilities under
ISRP-II will be made in line with the above institutional reforms. From July 1, 1996, PIDAs
will take charge of overall responsibility and actual operation and maintenance will be entrusted
to AWBs wherever applicable. Handing-over of the distributary and minor level canals and
drains to WUAs will be made gradually in due consideration of the results of the pilot PIM
projects to be implemented in each province.
The financial, operational and business plans of the PIDAs and AWBs should be
prepared in detail so that adequate O&M is achieved and commitments on cost recovery are met.
Equipment, procured under ISRP-II and currently used by PIDs, will be transferred
to PIDAs/AWBs.
The following indicators will be used to monitor operations and development impact.
The responsibilities will be assigned to each PID (later PIDA) and the responsibiity for
coordination will be assigned to FCC (later the office of Chief Engineering Advisor). At the end
of each year, PIDAs will prepare a monitoring report and submit it to GOP with a copy to IDA:
Annual operation status of canals:  Operation status of canals rehabilitated under ISRP-II will
be monitored by field engineers of PIDAs/AWRs regarding the following monitoring items: (i)
irrigated areas, (ii) quanltities of irrigation water supplied, and (iii) equity of water distribution.
An analysis of the (i) and (ii) will indicate whether irrigation water is supplied adequately or not.
Annual maintenance status:      Maintenance status of canals and drains, rehabilitated under
ISRP-II will be monitored by field engineers of PIDAs and AWBs with regards to (i) kinds and
quantities of maintenance works and (ii) maintenance cost required.
Annual operation of OM equipment:          The activities of OM equipment supplied to each
Province will be monitored by each PID (in cooperation with their workshops) every year with
regard to the following major monitoring items: (i) kinds and numbers of equipment used, (ii)



10
working hours of each equipment, (iii) kinds and quantities of works undertaken, (iii) status of
periodical maintenance, (iv) supply status of spareparts, and (v) overall work efficiency.
Abiana assessment and collection: Status of " Abiana" (including drainage cess) assessment and
collection will be monitored every year by PIDs in cooperation with the Revenue Departments.
A careful review will be made on any leakages in assessment and collection.
Crop intensity, yields and farmers' income:    For monitoring the development impact, change
of crop intensity, crop yields, and farmers' income levels will be monitored every year on
sample farms to be selected from the on-going hydraulic monitoring study. The provincial
agricultural departments will take charge of the monitoring assisted by PIDAs.

Attachment 2: Guidance on Government's Contribution to the ICR
Government's own final evaluation of the project implementation is an important
part of an ICR. It is attached, unedited, to the ICR sent to the World Bank Board. It can be
selective in its coverage and should address issues and lessons learned in project implementation,
from the borrower's perspective. Topics covered can be the same as in the ICR, namely,
project design, appraisal, implementation and project results. At each stage of the project the
contribution should comment on the performance of both IDA and the implementing agencies,
with the observations, where possible, supported by evidence or reasoned argument.
For project design the contribution could address such questions as the
appropriateness of the project's objectives, the size of the project and scope of the investments
proposed, aspects of design leading to easy (or difficult) implementation and the effect on
government institutions.
For project appraisal comments should concentrate on any significant changes in the
objectives, size and scope of the project and whether these were appropriate.
Project implementation experience should be divided into an assessment of IDA
performance in supporting and supervising the project and the performances of the implementing
agencies.
Project results include both an assessment of the direct physical benefits leading to
financial and economic benefits (or dis-benefits) arising from the project. Since financial and
economic re-analysis of the project will be undertaken as part of the ICR, it is suggested, if GOP
so wishes, that the contribution could most usefully comment on the effects of the project from
the government's perspective. Such an analysis would be a most useful contribution to the ICR.
Based on the foregoing sections, the contribution should list the main lessons learned
from the implementation experience and arising from the above analysis
The World Bank suggests that if the contribution is more than ten pages, it should
include a summary. The latter is recommended for all but the shortest contributions.
The mission will be happy to provide any further elaboration or clarification needed
to assist in the preparation of the contribution.

SECOND IRRIGATION SYSTEMS REHABILITATION PROJECT
IDA CREDIT 1888 - PAK
BORROWER'S BRIEF FOR IMPLEMENTATION COMPLETION REPORT
1.0   INTRODUCTION
Pakistan's economy is predominantly agrarian. Since the country is faced with the
disadvantage of being situated in arid to semi arid region with less than adequate
rainfall, the agriculture depends on surface irrigation. Over the period the
irrigation network has developed into one of the largest contiguous irrigation
system in the world. However, this irrigation network has suffered due to
deferred maintenance. Government of Pakistan and World Bank recognized this
and came up with a plan to rehabilitate the system. Part of the plan was
implemented as "Irrigation System Rehabilitation Project-I (ISRP-I) between
1982 - 1988. The Project was co-financed by IDA (Cr. 1888-PAK) and USAID.
2.0   PROJECT EVALUATION
The Project which envisaged the completion in 5 years from 1988 to 1 992, took 7
1/2 years to complete on December 31, 1995
2.1   PROJECT OBJECTIVES
The primary objectives of the Project were to:
(a)   improve agricultural production (i) providing a more reliable water supply,
reducing the risk of failure and removing physical constraints in the
irrigation network, and (ii) reducing crop losses resulting from rain
flooding by improving the surface drainage system;
(b)   provide a more equitable irrigation water supply to farmers by increasing
deliveries to water-deficient chaks mainly located in the lower reaches of
minors and distributaries, through a program of silt removal and redesign
of selected channels and outlets; and
(c)   strengthen the capabilities of the Provincial Irrigation Departments (PIDs)
Operation and Maintenance (O&M) programming to improve efficiency in
systems operation and ensure adequate maintenance of installed facilities.
In addition to the above, as part of the Project the Government of Pakistan
undertook to remove the O&M subsidy. Full recovery of O&M cost was to be
achieved by July 1977. This involved gradual increase in water charges, drainage
cess etc.

2.2   PROJECT COMPONENTS
The following were the components of the Project:
(a)   Civil Works for
(i)    Rehabilitation of canals
(ii)   Rehabilitation of drains
(iii) Repair of structures
(iv)   PID facilities
(v)   International Irrigation Management Institute (IIMI) Building
The civil works relating to (i) & (ii) above involved selected surface
irrigation and surface drainage schemes which were identified in the
Feasibility Report prepared by NESPAK in April 1987. Rehabilitation
works which generally aimed at bringing the canal prisms back to the
design section, were to be carried out on 13450 km length of canals and
1300 km of drains. The rehabilitation works on canals were to benefit
4.135,000 (ha) of irrigated area and the works on drains were to benefit
825.000 (ha) of this irrigated land. The targets of earthwork, stonework
and concrete work were 3343.8 Mcf 12.1 & 8.35 Mcf respectively. Unlike
rehabilitation work in ISRP-I which were picked up on the basis of
immediate needs, the rehabilitation work in ISRP-II was to take place on
the basis of completing a system or a sub-system, and in case a system or
sub-system was identified as hydraulically problematic, measures were to
be taken to address this problem.
A number of canals and structures like bridges, regulators and regulation
gates were rehabiliated under the Project through co-financing by USAID.
However, this component was curtailed as a result of Pressler Amendment.
PID facilities like workshops were improved and equipment supplied for
workshops at Lahore Bhalwal, Multan in Punjab, Jamshoro in Sind,
Peshawar & D.I. Khan in NWFP & Quetta in Balochistan. This part of the
project component was also financed by USAID. The construction of
IIMI building at Lahore was financed under IDA Credit.
(b)   Equipment
The Project provided for a broad range of construction, surveying, office
(including computers) equipment, and related spares. Some of the
equipment could not be provided because USAID which were to finance
this as aspect of component wound up activities earlier due to Pressler
Amendment.



(c)   Technical Assistance
The Project was to provide experts to assist the PIDs in specialized O&M
activities, design of schemes and construction/inspection. An O&M
specialist was to be appointed to assist PIDs for improving O&M
programs and procedures. This specialist was to assist PID staff to review
the ongoing activities to develop the annual O&M work programs. A
civil work construction specialist was to be appointed to assist PIDs for
improving efficiency of PID managed equipment. In addition to above a
design engineer was to be appointed to assist PIDs in design of
rehabilitation schemes and in redesign of problematic channels. These
specialists were to work along with counterpart PID staff and train these
staff.
Appointment of Supervisory Consultants to assist the F.C.C. and PIDs in
implementation of the Project was also part of the technical assistance.
Cost of supervisory Consultants was co-financed through IDA whereas the
aforementioned other specialists were provided under USAID grant.
(d)   Training
The Project envisage the following training that was to be financed under
LJ.S. grant:
(i)    About 25 study tours to both technically advanced and developing
countries with comparable irrigation and surface drainage
facilities;
(ii)  In-country and on-the-job training on O&M programs and
procedures for 900 staff with the rank of Assistant Engineer and
above; and
(iii)  In-country and on the job training for staff with equipment
workshop and warehouse responsibilities.
(e)   Supervision & Administration
The Project was to finance the expenditure on F.C.C. staff involved in the
Project Staff employed for the project in the offices a provincial
coordinators was also to be provided under the Project. The Project was
also to provide funds for direct support to PIDs, including the following:
(a) monitoring and evaluation; (b) management support; (c) equipment
management; (d) development of manuals; (e) operation & maintenance of
equipment; (f) planning and design; (g) mapping etc.

2.3    DESIGN IMPLEMENTATION & EXPERIENCE
The Project provided for redesign of problematic reaches or canals. An expatriate
design specialist was assigned to each Provincial Design Cells. The PID staff
alongwith the above specialist, using the field data provided by the field divisions
checked the design and finalized it using Lacey's Formulae and other national
approaches. This helped to improve the capabilities of Provincial Design Cells.
The field data collection involved discharge measurements using the appropriate
equipment. This helped in reviving use of design data collection techniques.

2.5 BORROWER PERFORMANCE
The borrower is Islamic Republic of Pakistan and the performance of the borrower
is as under.



5
EC
The borrower made the Credit proceeds available to FFC through budgetary
allocation and FFC made available such portions of the proceeds available for
physical works to the Provincial Irrigation Departments of the four provinces
and other concerned entities.
The FFC. has been managing the Project adequately and effectively as per the
conditions of the Credit as under:
I.    There was satisfactory arrangements between the borrower and the
provinces for their participation in the Project.
2.    Appointment of supervisory consultants was made in time.
3.    The offices of federal and provincial coordinators established for
IDRP-I were allowed to function for ISRP-II, so there was no loss of time-
because of these offices.
4.    Timely start & effective implementation of the project. There was no
delay due to the borrower who prepared and processed PC-I(s) promptly
which were pre-requisite for effectiveness of the Credit.
5.    The periodic progress reports, justifications for changes and
reimbursement/liquidation applications were fully documented and met
the requirements of IDA.
2.6   BANK PERFORMANCE
As a result of successful implementation of ISRP-I, IDA participation in terms of
increased financing twofold. The scope and guidelines for implementation of
civil works were increased to make the investment more meaningful by making it
mandatory on PIDs to assess the hydraulic performance not only of one individual
canal but of system and sub-system before taking up rehabilitation works.
Subsequent to signing of the Credit Agreement both the co-financing agencies
released the funds as quickly as possible. The completion of the Project was
delayed to the linkage of Credit effectiveness after the approval of Project Paper
of USAID which was delayed for a year. Again the completion of the Project
activities were adversely affected due to delay in decision by IDA for extending
the Credit closing date on two occasions. If the decision to allow the extension in



6
completion period had been taken in time and in one go by IDA the Project could
have been completed in a more satisfactory manner.
Unlike the regular and adequate supervision input provided by IDA staff during
ISRP-1. the supervision input during ISRP-I1 is not considered adequate. There
were changes twice in the project officers. Due to complexity of the project and
its different components the new project officers used to take some time before
uinderstanding real local needs.
2.7   KEY LESSONS LEARNT
(i)    Government of Pakistan and Government of Provinces have invested
heavily to rehabilitate about 50% of the total irrigated area which had
suffered due to deferred maintenance . In order to maintain the
rehabilitated works in good shape the GOP must provide adequate funding
till the department attain the status of self financing.
(ii)   Efficient and equitable operation of irrigation system should be ensured by
adhering to canal operation rules.
(iii)  There is yet need for more strengthening of capabilities of PIDs.
computerization and training.
3.0   OPERATION PLAN
The rehabilitated canals and drains are to be maintained and operated as per PID
procedures and with provincial NDBs.
4.0   MISCELLANEOUS COMMENTS
I.    Since the post-rehabilitation results from all the three areas recommended
by the Bank (Yaguchi's Mission) are available now, these may be
incorporated in para 7 (page 2) of the report.
2.    The economic analysis carried out in Appendix D to the draft ICR should
also take into account the agro-economic evaluation results of Venoi
(Punjab) and Nagna (Sindh) distributaries.



7
3.    It is not fair to mention in the ICR that the borrower attached insufficient
importance to agro-economic monitoring and evaluation. The borrower
(GOP has in fact fully complied with the Yaguchi Mission's
recommendations in this regard and completed the desired agro-economic
impact study. ICR Mission, however, wants to contillue this monitoring
further which can be undertaken in collaboration witlh any donor.
4.    Para 31 on page 7 of the draft ICR conveys a negative effect. Although
tempering of outlets or theft of water does sometimes occur on a few
chaninels, this situation cannot be generalized for all of the channels
rehabilitated under ISRP-I1. In fact ISRP-II has greatly helped in
providing equitable irrigation water by increasing deliveries in tail reaches.
The canal and Drainage Act also empowers the irrigation officials to take
action against such offenses. The para should, therefore, be deleted.
5.    The Project has generally been executed and completed successfully. The
Project has helped reasonably in achieving reliability of channels. Results
of monitoring showed considerable improvement of water deliveries at tail
reaches. Not a single breach has been observed in rehabilitated section of
the channels.
6.    With the completion of ISRP-II approximately 58% of the irrigation
system has been rehabilitated. To achieve the full benefits from the
rehabilitation, the remaining 42% of the system should also be
rehabilitated in the form of an on-going activity such as ISRP-III, etc.
7.    The mechanism for release of funds and reimbursements under ISRP-II
was very cumbersome as it involved lot of paper work and channels. It
would have been much better if special accounts of Provinces were
replenished directly by the donors. Similarly the payments to supervisory
consultant was routed through GOP channels resulting in considerable
delays. This could have been avoided if consultant were paid directly by
the bank as in the case of Flood Damages Restoration Project.
8.    The procedure for clearance of schemes was very difficult. Each scheme
had to be sent to Washington, D.C. for clearance. In fact even the
approval for revision of schemes was administered from Washington.
This could have been managed by the World Bank's Resident Mission in
Islamabad.



8
9.    ISRP had its own convenants which were being met. Later the covenants
of Fordwah Sadiqia were also superimposed on ISRP-II Project which
were difficult to meet.
10.   The in-puts by specialist provided under USAID was well intentioned but
the working of specialists in isolation and not working closely with PIDs
resulted in production of manuals, other printed materials and Iiydraulic
Design Criteria etc., which remained controversial and cannot be readily
used.
11.   The in-put of Supervisory Consultants has been satisfactory. and
assistance provided to PIDs by Supervisory Consultants was appreciated
by PIDs.

Dear Mr Yaguchi,
Thank you for your letter of April 4, 1996 and the attached Draft lmplementation Compledon
Report (ICR) for the Pakistan Second Irrigation Rehabilitation Project (Cr. 1 888-PAK, our ref
PK187024), which I have forwarded to the Development Cooperation Asia Department,
Ministy of Foreign Affairs in The Hague.
The Hague was pleased with this ICR and would like to inform you that this docLument
provides adequate information on the achievement of the project goals, including the
calculation of the Economic Rate of Retr, which as we all know is a difficult job. We hope
that methods will be developcd to improve the accuracy of the ERR.
With regarl to Appendix C, please note the following. In 1991 we have allocated NLG
16,000,000 for this project. Due to its slow implementation only NLG 8,050,519.71 has been
disbursed: in 1991 NLG 8,000,000 was tansferred to the Bank's account and in 1992
NLG 50,519.71 was paid directly to the consulting firm IHE. According to the latest
unaudited staement (January 18, 1996) there is an unspent balance of NLG 483,171.

IMPLEMENTATION COMPLETION REPORT
PAKISTAN
SECOND IRRIGATION SYSTEMS REHABILITATION PROJECT
(Cr. 1888-PAK)
Appendix D
Economic Analysis
Benefits
1.        The project's benefits may be divided into those stemming from its civil works and
related activities (including technical assistance for construction supervision) and those stemming
from institutional development, such as training and general technical assistance to the provincial
irrigation departments (PIDs).
2.        No attempt has been made either in the SAR or in the ICR to measure the benefits
from institutional development, principally financed by USAID. A substantial amount of training
and technical assistance was provided, of which the part most appreciated by the implementing
agencies is the short courses organized in Pakistan. A substantial amount of equipment was
provided to the PIDs including tractors, jeeps, excavators and flow-monitoring equipment. Only
a small part of the useful life of this equipment was spent on project-financed works. The part
most appreciated by the Borrower is the computer office equipment. Project benefit evaluation,
unfortunately, was of no relevance to project civil works, though some contributed to institution-
building of the PIDs and of WAPDA; the same can be said of benefit monitoring, except for the
monitoring carried out by ACOP/ISRI which served to identify the works needed to rehabilitate
the distributaries and surface drains. Construction of the Pakistan headquarters building of the
International Irrigation Management Institute (IIMI) should have long-term benefits, but not
benefits directly related to other project works. The amount spent on these components of the
project which do not enter into the economic-returns calculations below was Rs 361 million,
10% of actual project costs and considerably less than the share expected at appraisal. No further
analysis is made of these costs or of the benefits that might have been associated with them.
3.        Project civil works consisted principally of rehabilitation of 830 distributary canals
and surface drains to restore them to their designed condition after years of neglected
maintenance. These works, the technical assistance and irrigation-department effort devoted to
supervising them, the ACOP/ISRU monitoring costs, and 15% of project expenditures on
equipment (the estimated share of the useful life of that equipment devoted to project works)
account for the bulk of actual project costs (90%). The actual amount spent on them was Rs



PAKISTAN: Second Irrigation Systems Rehabilitation Project
Implementation Completion Report
Appendix D: Economic Analysis
3150 million. These are the costs against which on-farm benefits will be measured (See Table
1).
4.         Project works were scattered all over Pakistan. Individually, the subprojects were
small. In many cases, actual works on subprojects were completed during annual canal closure
(often one or two months only), when canal cleaning and lining could take place without
prejudice to farming operations. The average expenditure on civil works and the support
necessary to carry them out per hectare of irrigated farmland commanded by the repaired canals
was small, about Rs 660 (US$24). In this situation, benefits per hectare commanded are also
likely to be small. For this reason, and because they are geographically dispersed, the benefits
are hard to detect and measure.
5.         The same conditions applied to the first ISRP. While the SAR for ISRP-2 is
sanguine about the benefits from ISRP-1"', the ISRP-1 Project Completion Report (PCR) says,
"Whether the principal project objective of increasing agricultural production... has been
achieved cannot be shown conclusively because sufficient data on benefits directly attributable
to the project are not available. ...agro-economic evaluation... was inconclusive; ... {also a
problem is} the unknown impact of other factors such as benefits from on-farm development,
improvement in watercourses and moghas or presence of private tubewells."2'
6.         In tacit recognition of this fact, ISRP-2 provided for very specific monitoring and
evaluation (M&E) of project benefits (SAR, paras. 5.12-4) which were to be financed by USAID
(paras. 4.03, 4.06) and agreement on which was made a legal covenant (SAR, para. 8.01g).
The sample to be monitored every semester was three distributaries in Punjab, two in Sindh, and
one each in NWFP and Balochistan. Monitoring was to cover hydraulics and agro-economics
of each, leading to a preliminary economic analysis of each. Provinces were to contract with
evaluation organizations, on terms and conditions suitable to IDA, by 30 September 1988, to
carry out the work, which would be financed by the project.
7.         In the event, hydraulic surveys for all sample distributaries were contracted to
WAPDA's Alluvial Canal Observation Project (ACOP)(now the International Sedimentation
Research Institute (ISRI)). Agro-economic monitoring in the Punjab was contracted to Punjab
Economic Research Institute (PERI); in the other provinces, it was contracted to WAPDA's
Watercourse Monitoring & Evaluation Directorate (WM&ED). ISRI completed benchmarks on
seven distributaries and one drain (Killianwala, 1 1-L Pakpattan,Venoi and Mona Bhera drain in
Punjab, Nagnah & Puran in Sindh, Chowky in NWFP, and Nari in Balochistan) before
I  Report No. 6991-PAK, para 2.24-2.25.

Appendix D: Economic Analysis
rehabilitation works began. PERI completed a benchmark on the three Punjabi distributaries and
on control farms; WM&ED completed benchmarks without controls on the four non-Punjab
distributaries. ISRI's work was funded principally from the IDA credit, PERI's and initially
WM&ED's principally from the USAID grant.
8.         ISRI monitored or was monitoring post-rehabilitation hydraulics of six distributaries
and one drain. (Puran was dropped from the project.) Of these, only three, Venoi, Nagnah and
Chowky) had been completed and reports issued by February 1996. Agro-economic monitoring
was disrupted when USAID stopped making new commitments in 1990 and disbursements in
1993. PERI was never contracted to follow up its benchmark surveys. GOP provided WM&ED
with a small budget to conduct follow-up surveys on only three distributaries (Chowky, Venoi
& Nagnah) in 1995.
9.         The Chowky agro-economic impact evaluation report was issued in January 1996.
It showed a large increase in kharif cropping intensity (from 59% to 90%) and a modest increase
in rabi cropping intensity (from 79% to 85 %) between the baseline period (1990-1) and the post-
improvement-works period (1992-3). Moreover, farm income increased overall, by a negligible
1-2% at the head reaches but by 36% at the tail. In the absence of a control, however, it is
impossible to tell which, if any, of these changes stem from project works and which stem from
other causes, such as price changes or climatic factors. In fact, the findings of the ISRI
hydraulic report on Chowky make it appear unlikely that the increases stem from the project.
It shows that average inflows to the head of Chowky Distributary were about 50% of design
before project works; after canal improvement, they were 50% in kharif and 46% in rabi.
Distributaries will not operate properly when flows are less than about 80% of design. With
water availability like this, no amount of project works on the distributary would help Chowky.
Because stone facing was placed on canal sides, conveyance losses declined by 8 to 9.7%.
Reliability improved at the middle and tail. Nevertheless, equity did not improve overall and
outlet performance deteriorated a bit. Some outlets which had been tampered with to increase
water deliveries to their commands and which the project restored to design flows were reported
to have been tampered with again. As a former Director of IIMI Pakistan concludes, "...it is
difficult to conclude that the changes in agricultural economics indicators are an impact of
changes in hydraulic variables."and "the water supply to the five watercourses in the agro-
economics sample did not appreciably change from pre-rehabilitation to the post-rehabilitation
period. l/

Appendix D: Economic Analysis
10.         In May 1996, WM&ED completed and published the results of its hastily completed
agro-economic follow-up surveys on Venoi distributary in Punjab and Nagna distributary in
Sindh." The Nagna results, while intesting, are not useful for puposes of economic analysis
for two reasons. Firstly, no non-project control has been surveyed either at baseline or at post-
project evaluation. Therefore there is no way of knowing which changes, if any, stem from
project works. Secondly, Nagna distributary suffered a catastrophic breach after project-financed
improvements. Cropping intensity was 147% on the affected middle reach before the project
and 84% after the project with substantial areas still flooded at the time of the survey. Nagna
cropping intensity on all reaches fell from 126 % before the project to 101 % after the project.2
Moreover, in the non-breach-affected areas of Nagna's head and tail, inequitie became greater
after the project than they had been before. Cropping intensity increased on head reaches and
decreased on tail reaches. Similarly, crop yields increased on head reaches but increased less or
declined on tail reaches "... partly due to water shortage and partly flooding of some sample
areas ...3!
Venoi results, while much stronger, are compromised because PERI did not share its baseline
data with WM&ED.4' As a result, WM&ED drew uip and surveyed a new sample. farm sizes
of WM&ED's sample differ significantly from farm sizes of PERI's benchmark sample,
probably not just as a result of the project. 5' Despite this weakness, Venoi data are the best
indication available of the agro-economic impact of ISRP II.
Cropping intensity on Venoi was 166% before rehabilitation in 1990 and 165.5 % afterwards in
1995. On the unrehabilitated control distributary, cropping intensity fell from 175% in 1990 to
167% in 1995. Thus the net fall in cropping intensity avoided by the project was 7.3%  or 1.4%
per year for five years. Figures on seed, manure and other fertilizer use and on crop yields do
not indicate a clear pattern of change stemming from the project. Farm income analysis on
Venoi and its control distributary is not wholly convincing due to problems in comparing
samples and prices betwee benchmark and impact. However, net farm income per hectare is
probably indicative. It fell by 3 % in the project area and by about 11% in the control area. This
net fall avoided due to the project of about 1.8% per year is comparable to the 1.4% per year
fall in cropping intensity avoided.

11.         The only supplement to this meagre survey evidence of project benefits is anecdotal,
but compelling nonetheless.  It is the strong demand shown by farmers whose land is
commanded by the distributaries for the project's civil works.  PID  engineers and the
supervising consultants' staff testify to this demand, which was confirmed by the mission's
contact with farmers. While the project's works cost the farmers nothing, they are potentially
disruptive. A strong demand indicates that many farmers think they have a beneficial effect on
their farming.
Economic Analysis
12.         The ICR conducts economic analysis in two ways.
13.         Firstly, it reproduces the analysis using the method and assumptions of the SAR, but
using actual or re-estimated costs and prices. The SAR assumed that project works would have
small effects on cropping intensity and on yields and on-farm inputs as follows:
cropping intensity was expected to decline over 5 years in the absence of
the project but to increase over 5 years after project works as follows:
Province                     Without Project          With Project
Punjab                            -3%                      +5%
Sindh                             -3%                      +4%
NWFP"                             -9%                      +4%
Balochistan"                      -8%                     + 11%
output yields were expected to remain constant without the project but to
increase by from 3% to 10% over 5 years after completion of project works
with the project, depending on the crop; and
inputs were expected to remain constant without the project and, in most
cases, with the project also. However, with the project, fertilizer inputs
Because the share of NWFP and Balochistan in project works is so small, the effects of these higher differential
cropping-intensity assumptions on project outcome are not significant.

were expected to rise modestly (usually by the same amount as yields) and
labour use was expected to grow by from 4 to 6%.
14.        The results of these assumptions, converted into 1996 Rupees, in terms of annual
incremental net on-farm benefit per hectare, are as follows:'
Province   % of Works              Financial              Economic
Punjab        72                   Rs 652                 Rs 2113
Sindh         21                   Rs 1052                Rs 2620
NWFP          6                    Rs 1398                Rs 2210
Balochistan    1                   Rs 4658                Rs 5360
Weighted Average                   Rs 821                 Rs 2248
This is the value that is used for economic analysis as per the SAR. There is no evidence that
these SAR assumptions have been realized.  The following calculation is presented for
comparative purposes only. The method used of re-valuing net on-farm benefits calculated in the
SAR in 1996 Rs terms was checked by comparing prices used in the recent SAR for the
Balochistan Community Irrigation and Agriculture Project2' with the prices used in the project
SAR revalued in 1996 Rs terms, weighted by their importance indicated in the FARMOD
calculations. This showed that, both for output and input prices, those calculated by adjustment
of prices adopted in the SAR (revalued in 1996 Rs terms and weighted by their relative
importance in the farm models) and those prices presented in the August 1995 Balochistan report
(similarly weighted) showed no significant difference. i.e. they were within 10% of each other
or within the limits of accuracy of estimation.

15.          As explained in para 3, the ICR analysis included only those investment costs likely
to have contributed to those benefits (see Table 1). Prevailing prices have been adjusted to 1996
Rupees and converted to economic prices by using specific conversion factors" .
16.          The area benefitted by the project is as reported by the project office, namely the
total irrigated area covered by the project.2' Most individual subprojects were completed in less
than a year -- usually in a month or two; therefore, completion of civil works is apportioned
over the project period as per expenditures on civil works. Areas are proportionately reduced
to allow for the SAR assumption that farmers make one-fifth of their ultimate adjustment from
pre-project to full-development farmning practices each year for five years after civil works are
completed (see Table 2).
17.          The recalculation assumes, as the SAR did, that there is no difference in O&M  costs
with and without the project.3"
18.          On this basis, the project's civil works and the accompanying support necessary to
make them happen yield an economic IRR of about 90%.
19.          Secondlv, the ICR makes another economic analysis based on assumptions that, with
the benefit of hindsight, appear more reasonable than those made at appraisal.
20.          The SAR assumptions about increased cropping intensity, stem principally from the
conviction that project works would bring more water to the tails of distributaries, thereby
permitting tail-enders to increase their cropping intensity by more than the reductions which
project works would impose on head-enders who were previously taking more than their allotted
share of canal water. From mission observations, the ISRI Chowky report, and from IIMI
Specifically, 0.817 for civil works, 0.826 for expenses of the PIDs and of FCC, 0.86 and 0.9 respectively for ACOP and NESPAK on
the assumption that their salaries and other expenses reflect more competition and closer to market than the administrative services, and
no adjustment for the imported equipment.
2''    These may be somewhat exaggerated. The mission encountered examples of distributaries where the required works
could not be completed within the project allocation and where the PIDs used their own funds to complete the
works. Nevertheless, the entire distributary command is reported as having benefitted from the project. This over-
reporting of area benefitted probably accounts for the increase in area benefitted over SAR estimates in the face
of physical works and real costs that are less than SAR estimates.
3/   However, there should be some improvement in the quality of O&M because of reduced silt deposits and simpler
maintenance due to canal lining.

research" , it is clear that such benefits either don't exist or tend to be short-lived as those who
had been stealing their neighbours' water in the past re-assert their position. A more detailed
analysis would require further information on the impact of the project on farmers performance
in crop production and use of inputs at the head and tail end of canals, as well as the area
covered by each, all of which is presently lacking.
21.         A more justifiable assumption would be that the principal benefit from the project
works is maintenance -- keeping the system from deteriorating further. The consequences of
deterioration are sometimes dramatic (as when a canal breaches, destroys crops and floods
villages) and sometimes mundane (as when cropping intensities and yields decline gradually and
farmers shift to crops that tolerate more water stress, waterlogging or salinity according to the
case). Moreover, it is, of course, reasonable to believe that, without the project works, flows
in the distributaries and to the crop root zones would have been a little lower. On Chowky
distributary, after lining, ACOP measured conveyance loss-reduction of 8 to 9.7 percent of the
about 10% normally lost, which means about one percent more water.2' Without canal cleaning
done by the project, de-silting is frequently neglected, sometimes leading not only to skewed
distribution but to reduced overall flows in the distributary. Also gains in canal water available
due to canal works may be partly offset by losses elsewhere. The benefit of improving water
delivery at the tail end of canals will only be fully incremental in situations where the water
would otherwise have been wasted at the head end. Since this is by no means always the case,
the tail-end gains in production may be partially offset by some loss of output at the head end.
Reduction in seepage losses could also be argued to result in less groundwater recharge3",
although reduced percolation in the canal would be largely compensated by increased recharge
from the fields in which the water is eventually applied.
22.         Unfortunately, there is scant evidence serving to quantify these effects. Regarding
dramatic deterioration, there is evidence of a significant number of canal breaches before the
project. The Borrower has asserted that there were no breaches on project-rehabilitated canals.
This general assertion is contradicted by WM&ED's report on Nagna distributary: "... the
command area of one out of two watercourses comprising the middle reach of subsystem was
flooded by canal breach during last year while low lying area was still submerged at the time

31  In Pakistan, 54 % of groundwater is captured for irrigation. It is estimated that 40 % of seepage goes to saline
groundwater and becomes a liability and 6% to fresh groundwater that is not recaptured for irrigation.

of the survey."" Regarding the deterioration of agricultural results without the project, there
is the evidence of the cropping-intensity losses on the Venoi control distributary, which were
avoided on Venoi when it was rehabilitated. The latter is the best piece of available evidence
on farming effects with and without the project. Operations Evaluation Department (OED)
impact evaluation studies on similar and earlier projects have produced inconclusive results on
farming effects.
23.         There is a clear problem in generalizing from the tentative survey results on Venoi
(which commands 21,617 ha) and its control distributary to the project area of more than
4 million ha. However, the kind of project outcome evidenced at Venoi is much more probable,
on the present facts, than the kinds of benefits assumed by the SAR. Therefore, the second
economic analysis calculates, in view of known project costs and estimated impact area, the rate
of return to the project investments if cropping intensity losses avoided on Venoi distributary are
typical of results throughout the project. As will be seen, given the immense sunk cost in
Pakistan's surface irrigation system and the very modest project cost/ha, very small losses
avoided per ha, sustained over time, generate attractive returns on project investments.
24.         Conversion of prevailing (financial) prices into the opportunity costs for Pakistan
(economic prices) was done as above (see para 14 and Table 1B). As a result of the progressive
liberalization of Pakistan's economy in recent years, the financial-to-economic adjustments are
relatively modest. Unlike the SAR, it is assumed that farmers will adjust quickly to changes in
their irrigation. The farmers in question are experienced irrigators and used to coping with the
vicissitudes of quirky systems. The starting point for these assumed changes is the starting point
assumed by the SAR -- the annual net on-farm benefit per hectare, converted to 1996 Rupees:2'

relatively constant, the calculations could have been based on gross rather than net on-farm benefit.

25.        If the factors discussed above add up to the tentative results indicated by the Venoi
survey -- that is, stable agricultural production with the project but a decline in the value of
agricultural production without the project of about 1.4% per year for five years' - - then the
economic return to project works is 17%. If the losses avoided by project distributary
rehabilitation are only one percent per year for five years, then the economic return is 10% (see
Table 3).
26.        Clearly, these figures are indicative only. But what they indicate is clear. Pakistan
has an immense investment in the Indus irrigation system. Losing the fruits of that investment
by failing to maintain the system properly has immense costs. Provided that the Rs 660
(US$24)/ha spent on maintenance by this project was sensibly spent, even very small losses
avoided make that expenditure worthwhile.
27.        The evidence is that the works carried out by ISRP-2 were sensible works executed
well and reasonably efficiently. The scattering of survey evidence suggests that irrigators are
right to value the project interventions, which they definitely do.  It is probable that the
economic rate of return to project works, therefore, is of the order of 17%, which is an
acceptable result in view of Pakistan's supposed opportunity cost of capital of about 10%.
28.        The mission has not undertaken separate analyses for each of the four provinces. In
the absence of impact evaluation studies, information on the variation in agricultural benefits in
each of the four provinces is lacking. Information on expenditures on civil works and area
benefitted for each province show that, compared with the overall average of Rs 660 or US$24
per ha, the cost in Punjab (which accounts for about 72% of the cost of project works) would
be around US$19 per ha, Sindh (which accounts for 21% of project works) would be about
US$24 per ha, and NWFP, accounting for 6% of project works, would be about US$36 per ha.
If agricultural benefits in the three provinces are similar (which is the general conclusion that
may be drawn from the SAR analysis summarized in para 14 above), then for these three
provinces the economic rate of return could be expected to be at or above Pakistan's supposed
opportunity cost of capital, 10%. This may not be the case for the fourth province of
Balochistan, which accounts for only around 1 % of the total cost of project works, the cost per
ha benefitted would be much higher at around US$218 per ha. This appears to be a reflection
of the more substantive works undertaken and the generally small size of schemes, as well as
the remoteness and difficulties in construction and contractor operation reported by supervision
missions. Information to permit further analysis of the project result in Balochistan is lacking,
since the ISRI impact evaluation study on the Nari main canal is not yet available. If, as
Followed by stability of agricultural production both with and without the project for an indefinite period.

requested by IDA", the agreement between the Federal Coordination Cell (FCC) and ISRI is
extended to allow completion of monitoring, the results could be used for a separate analysis of
the clearly different situation in Balochistan. As the IDA letter points out, the availability of the
evaluation result would be indispensable for any further analysis.
