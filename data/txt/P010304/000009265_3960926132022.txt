MEMORANDUM AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT
OF THE INTERNATIONAL DEVELOPMENT ASSOCIATION
TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS
ON A PROPOSED CREDIT
TO THE ISLAMIC REPUBLIC OF PAKISTAN
FOR A SECOND IRRIGATION SYSTEMS REHABILITATION PROJECT
1.       The following memorandum and recommendation on a proposed development
credit to the Islamic Republic of Pakistan (GOP) for SDR 58.2 million (US$79.5
million equivalent) is submitted for approval. The proposed credit would be
on standard terms, with 35 years maturity, and would help finance a Second
Irrigation Systems Rehabilitation Project (ISRP-II).  The project would be
cofinanced by USAID for US$95.3 million and the Netherlands for US$8.5 million
equivalent.
2.       Background.  Pakistan's population is estimated at about 100 million
(1987) and is growing at an annual rate of about 32. The average per capita
income in 1986 %as about US$380, with about 302 of the population having an
income below .he absolute poverty level. Agriculture is the largest goods
producing se^tor *n Pakistan's economy and over 502 of the population is
engaged in agricultural activities. The climate is arid to subtropical, which
necessitates irrigation for most crop production. About 90X of agricultural
production comes from 16.2 M ha of irrigated land. The irrigation systems
have deteriorated because of inadequate maintenance, which has resulted in
unreliable water supplies and inequ5t.ble deliveries--particularly to farms
located along the tail reaches of supply canals. Surface drains have become
clogged with silt and weeds which has caused excessive crop losses from rain
flooding. The proposed project- would generally replicate most of the features
of the Irrigation Systems Rehabilitation Project (ISRP-I, Credit 1239-PAK),
but it would cover other areas. ISRP-I, cofinanced by IDA and USAID, was a
five-year (FY83-87) project designed to rehabilitate about 25. of the
irrigation and surface drainage systems. As of June 30, 1987, about 90% of
ISRP-I's physical and financial targets for civil works had been
accomplished. Other accomplishments of ISRP-I included: significant
strengthening of the Provincial Irrigation Departments (PIDs) and substantial
increases in the Provincial budget allocations (over 15% annually) for the
operation and maintenance (O&M) of the irrigation, drainage and flood control
systems. However, considerable rehabilitation work remains to be done, and
additional strengthening of PIDs' capability is required.
3.       Rationale for IDA Involvement.  The proposed TSRP-II forms an
integral part of GOP's sector development strategy. The strategy for
irrigated agriculture is based largely on the findings and recommendations of
the "Revised Action Program (RAP) for Irrigated Agriculture" (Pakistan Water
and Power Development Authority, May 1979), which was financed by UNDP with
the Bank as executing agency. RAP's recommended water sector investment
priorities are rehabilitation, water management and drainage projects.
Rehabilitating the irrigation systems, as provided in ISRP-II, is a major
strategy of GOP' Sixth Five-Year Plan (FY84-88), which is expected to carry
over to the Seventh Plan (FY89-93). Even though considerable progress was made
in ISRP-I, much of the required work remains to be done, and IDA's continuing
involvement would be an important factor in ensuring its completion,



- 2 -
particularly as a means of sustaining the emphasis on rehabilitation, assuring
adequate O&M funding and mobilizing the required financial resources for the
project from within the country and abroad.
4.       Project Objectives.  The project objectives are to: (i) increase farm
income and agricultural production by improving the reliability and
equitability of irrigation water supplies and reducing crop losses from rain
flooding; and (ii) strengthen the PIDs' capability to carry out efficiently
the O&M of the irrigation, drainage and flood control systems.
5.       Project Description.  The proposed five-year (FY89-93) project would
be implemented by the PIDs in all four Provinces with coordination at the
Federal level by the Ministry of Water and Power. The project is designed to
rehabilitate surface irrigation and surface drainage systems, commanding about
4.1 and 0.8 M ha of cropland respectively, by providing equipment, technical
assistance, and training, and the strengthening of supervision and
administration. In many aspects, ISRP-II would be modelled after the
operational and institutional features of ISRP-I; however, certain
modifications are envisaged to achieve improved O&M of the systems including
greater assurance and equity of deliveries based on the experience of ISRP-I.
These improvements include: (i) rehabilitation of complete systems/subsystems;
(ii) redesign of systems/subsystems (including outlets); (iii) installation of
concrete and/or masonry lining on selected canal reaches; and (iv) modernizing
PIDs' management program. The total cost of the project is estimated at
US$220.4 million equivalent with a foreign exchange component of US$66.4
million (30X). A breakdown of costs and the financing plan are shown in
Schedule A. Amounts and methods of procurement and of disbursements, and the
disbursement schedule are shown in Schedule B. A timetable of key project
processing events and the status of Bank Group operations in Pakistan are
given in Schedules C and D, respectively. A map is also attached. The Staff
Appraisal Report, No. 6991-PAK, dated March 8, 1988 is also attached.
6.       Agreed Actions.  Improving irrigation O&M cost recovery is the only
significant project related issue. Under several completed and ongoing Bank
Group assisted projects, e.g., Structural Adjustment Loan (Ln. 2166/Cr.
1255-Pak) and ISRP-I (Cr. 1239-Pak), GOP and the Provinces have agreed to
attain full recovery of O&M costs through water charges, or other appropriate
financial arrangements, by dates ranging from June 30, 1988 for Sind to June
30, 1992 for Baluchistan. The overall cost recovery rate has declined from a
peak of 53% in FY83 to 38% in FFY87. The significant O&M cost recovery
shortfall arises from an unprecedented rate of O&M expenditure growth during
the past five years, averaging about 152 compared to about 5% annual growth in
collection of water charges. Given the large current recovery gap, the Bank
accepts GOP's position that the four Provinces will be unable to meet their
O&M subsidy removal targets as agreed under previous Bank operations.
7.       Following extensive consultations between GOP, GOProvinces and the
Bank, a new approach has been developed to achieve full O&M cost recovery.
This approach focusses on the need to achieve O&M cost recovery through water
charges/drainage cesses exclusively (the only appropriate and feasible
financial arrangement), while at the same time undertaking actions that will
relieve some of the financial burdens of maintaining the facilities. GOP and
GOProvinces have agreed to continue the existing Government policy of
privatizing public tubewells (TWs) in fresh groundwater (FGW) areas, which is



known as the SCARP transition program. The privatization program would serve
two essential objectives viz., improved management of FGW resources and
reduction of the financial burden of the Provinces by about $50 million
annually. The agreed actions are: (i) prohibition of public investments in
new and replacement TWs for public operation in FGW areas, with the exception
of two ongoing externally assisted projects in Sind, i.e., South Rohri and
Ghotki projects; (ii) finalization of feasibility studies by June 30, 1989 for
a Second SCARP Transition Project in Punjab and a Pilot SCARP Transition
Project in Sind, both to be completed by June 30, 1994; (iii) completion of
subsequent SCARP Transition Projects in Punjab and Sind by June 30, 1998; (iv)
completion of a nationwide study by GOP by March 31, 1989 to improve water
rate assessment and collection programs; and (v) filling any O&M cost recovery
shortfalls remaining after June 30, 1992 (after the program to tighten
assessments and collections has become fully effective) by the Punjab and Sind
Governments through appropriate water rate adjustments. Since Punjab and Sind
have about 90% of the irrigation command, water rates for surface irrigation
in these two provinces will serve as proxy for NWFP and Baluchistan
respectively. The public groundwater irrigation facilities would be exempted
from the requirement concerning O&M cost recovery, provided the FGW TW
privatization program is carried out as agreed.
8.       Benefits.  Economic benefits from the proposed project are expected
from: (i) increases in agricultural production through greater reliability and
equity of irrigation water deliveries, particularly to the tail reaches, and
increased water supplies resulting from rehabilitation, which would directly
benefit over 1 million families and increase the cropped area by over 300,000
ha through higher cropping intensity; (ii) reduction in crop losses from rain
flooding through the rehabilitation of surface drains; and (iii) improved
effectiveness in the O&M of the irrigation systems through the strengthening
of the PIDs. The estimated economic rate of return is 311. Since the project
involves rehabilitating "in place" infrastructure, no significant negative
environmental effects are anticipated, while positive results are expected
from improved wildlife habitat as well as reduction in waterlogging and of
water-borne diseases.
9.       Risks.  Because the project is highly divisible, the risks involved
would be low. If financial constraints in the Provinces necessitate
adjustments in the proposed implementation targets, this could be accommodated
through changes in project scope or phasing, which would not affect the
overall rate of return. There is the risk that GOP and the Provinces may be
unable to meet their O&M subsidy removal commitments within the stipulated
period because of political or other factors. However, GOP is committed and
has already taken some steps to phase out subsidies which, among others, is an
important means of containing the budget deficit.
10.      Recommendations.  I am satisfied that the proposed credit would
comply with the Articles of Agreement of the Association and recommend that
the Executive Directors approve the proposed credit.
