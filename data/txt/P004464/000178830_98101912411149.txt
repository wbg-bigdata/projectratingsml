MAGAT RIVER MULTIPURPOSE PROJECT: STAGE II IRRIGATION
STAFF APPRAISAL REPORT
1. BACKGROUND
General
1.01      The Government of the Philippines has requested the Bank and the
International Fund for Agricultural Development (IFAD) to assist in financing
the irrigation component of the second stage of development of the Magat
River Multipurpose Project in Northern Luzon. The first stage of development
consists of the provision of water distribution systems to irrigate a total
of 75,000 ha of rice in the wet season and 29,000 ha in the dry season. The
Asian Development Bank (ADB) extended a loan in 1973 to assist in the rehabi-
litation of 40,000 ha of existing irrigation systems under Stage IA of the
project. The Bank provided financial assistance for the development of
irrigation facilities in the remaining 35,000 ha of land in Stage IB in
1975 (Loan 1154-PH). The loan also provided for engineering studies to
review the technical and economic feasibility of implementing the Stage TI
development of the Magat river consisting of the construction of a storage
dam, a hydroelectric station and additional irrigation facilities for about
27,000 ha of rainfed land. The Bank provided assistance for construction of
the Magat river dam in 1978 (Loan 1567-PH) and the Government is obtaining
supplier finance to build the hydroelectric component of the project.
1.02      A feasibility study of the Stage II irrigation development of the
Magat river was prepared under the provisions of Loan 1154-PH by the National
Irrigation Administration with assistance of the associated consulting firms,
Engineering Consultants Inc. of Denver, Colorado; Shawinigan Engineering Co.
Ltd. of Montreal, Canada; Engineering and Development Corporation of the
Philippines and DCCD Engineering Corporation of Manila. This report is based
on that study and the findings of a Bank appraisal mission which visited the
Philippines in April 1978, composed of Messrs. E. G. Giglioli and V. Talvadkar.
Mr. A. N. Khan also assisted with the report.
The Agricultural Sector
1.03      Agriculture is the predominant sector in the Philippine economy,
accounting for about one third of net domestic product, over one half of
total employment, and nearly three quarters of export earnings. Over 70% of
the 9 million ha of land under cultivation is used for the production of
cereals, of which rice and corn are the most important. The remaining land
is taken up by the major export crops: sugar, coconuts, abaca, pineapples,
and tobacco.
1.04      The performance of the agricultural sector will be crucial in
determining whether the Philippines can increase incomes both rapidly and
equitably. At present, the domestic market for industrial products is
limited by relatively low rural incomes. Although in recent years there has
been a substantial change in the terms of trade in favor of agriculture, the
problems of poverty and income distribution continue to be particularly acute
in rural areas; of the 15 million people in the lowest 40% of the income
scale, 12 million live in rural areas. The Government is aware of these



- 2 -
problems and has initiated a number of programs designed to assist the rural
poor.
1.05      A major Government objective is to increase rice and corn produc-
tion as a means of raising the incomes of small farmers and of attaining
national self-sufficiency in food grains. After experiencing substantial
deficits in the early 1970s, rice production grew by 5% p.a. during crop
years 1974-77 and the Philippines was able to provide for consumption solely
from domestic production during the crop years 1975-77. In 1977, the Govern-
ment exported 90,000 tons and built up a supply of about three months. The
major factors contributing to the recent sharp rise in production appear to
be the continued expansion of irrigated area and high yielding varieties on
both irrigated and rainfed land and, more significantly, a run of particularly
favorable weather. With the continued growth in population and incomes, the
demand for rice is expected to rise by about 3.0% annually over the period
1978-90. Based on a projected annual growth of 3.7% in production, under
average weather conditions, the Philippines is expected to reach a balance
between production and consumption no later than 1982 and to be by 1985 in a
position to export between 100,000 and 125,000 tons annually. By 1990 the
Philippines could export from 350,000 to 375,000 tons. Exports of this
magnitude, about 3% of projected world rice trade in 1990, could be accomodated
without adversely affecting prices. This would require an increase in
irrigated harvested area of about 425,000 ha between 1977 and 1985 and an
increase of about 200,000 ha between 1985 and 1990. World Bank-assisted
projects for which financing has been arranged or is contemplated would
provide about 240,000 ha of irrigated harvested area.
1.06      The Government recognizes that in order to increase production in
both irrigated and nonirrigated areas further improvements in the quality
of supporting services will be necessary beyond those initiated in recent
years. In 1973, the Government instituted a national program for supervised
credit for rice production, Masagana 99, which greatly increased the provision
of production credit and technical assistance, mainly to smaller farmers.
However, the levels of arrears under the program have been very high in the
last several years and as a result the credit coverage of the program
has declined sharply. The Government is aware of this problem and the
Technical Board for Agricultural Credit has undertaken a study of the causes
of the high arrears under Loan 1399-PH. This study is to be discussed
with Bank staff in early 1979 with a view to developing steps necessary to
reduce arrears and maintain an adequate flow of production credit. In the
meantime, efforts are continuing to enable farmers to make the most effective
use of the lower level of inputs they are able to afford using their own cash
and from non-institutional sources of credit.
1.07      The Government is also considering the steps necessary to bring
about needed improvements in the national extension service. A Bank technical
assistance mission visited the Philippines in April 1977 and a report was given
to the Government suggesting a number of organizational improvements and better
logistical support in the form of training, vehicles and other facilities.
The Bank is providing assistance to the recently initiated national extension
project. A sector mission also visited the Philippines to help the Government
prepare a comprehensive program for strengthening support services (extension,
fertilizer, seeds, and crop protection).



1.08      Since 1969 the Bank Group has financed ten irrigation projects
designed to increase rice production in the country. These projects - three
in Central Luzon, three in the Cagayan valley of Northern Luzon, one on Mindoro
Island, one in the Visayas and two for smaller systems throughout Northern
Luzon, the Visayas and Mindanao /1 - have set the pattern for the type of
irrigation rehabilitation, new construction, and operations needed for
increasing rice production. The projects are providing improved irrigation
and drainage facilities, better road systems for efficiency of operations and
maintenance and for the marketing of farm products, stronger supporting
services to assist farmers in adopting the new irrigation techniques needed
to increase production, and technical assistance and training to help the
National Irrigation Administration (NIA) expand and improve its irrigation
program. These projects would bring about substantial increases in rice
production on about 370,000 ha and would benefit nearly 190,000 farmer
families, most of whom are smallholders.
1.09      Work on the first Bank-assisted project, the Upper Pampanga River
Project (Loan 637-PH), is completed. Progress on all the irrigation projects
has been generally satisfactory and the NIA has proved itself to be a well
managed and technically competent organization. The total cost of the first
two projects was about 70% over appraisal estimates in the case of the
Pampanga project (Loan 637-PH) and 55% in the case of the Aurora-Penaranda
Irrigation Project (Loan 984-PH and Credit 472-PH) largely because of rapid
inflation following the oil price increase in 1973. However, as a result of
considerable increases in the projected world market price of rice and
earlier than anticipated irrigation benefits the rates of return on both
projects have not changed significantly.
Project Formulation
1.10      Magat River Development.  In 1973 the National Irrigation Adminis-
tration (NIA), with US Bureau of Reclamation assistance, completed a feasi-
bility study of the Magat river project, and recommended the development of a
multipurpose project on the river. Because of the physical size, large esti-
mated cost and long construction period, NIA divided implementation of the
project into two stages. Stage I consists of the rehabilitation and upgrad-
ing of the existing Magat River Irrigation System (MARIS) and Siffu River
Irrigation System (SIFRIS) and construction of new facilities for a total of
75,000 ha that can be served by run-of-river diversion in the wet season.
The Asian Development Bank (ADB) assisted NIA to rehabilitate 40,000 ha of
Stage IA under the Angat-Magat Integrated Agricultural Development Project.
/1  The Upper Pampanga River Irrigation Project (Loan 637-PH), Aurora-
Penaranda Irrigation Project (Loan 984-PH, Credit 472-PH), Tarlac Irri-
gation Systems Improvement Project (Loan 1080-PH), Mindoro Rural Develop-
ment Project (Loan 1102-PH), Magat River Multipurpose Project Stage I
(Loan 1154-PH), Chico River Irrigation Project Stage I (Loan 1227-PH),
Jalaur Irrigation Project (Loan 1367-PH), National Irrigation Systems
Improvement Project I (Loan 1414-PH), National Irrigation Systems
Improvement Project II (Loan 1526-PH) and Magat River Multipurpose
Project Stage II (Loan 1567-PH).

The remaining 35,000 ha of Stage IB are being developed with Bank assistance
under Loan 1154-PH. Provision was also made under the loan for engineering
studies (Part A) to evaluate the economic feasibility of Stage II development
and, if justified, to prepare (Part B) final designs, specifications and bid
documents for construction of the dam and appurtenant works. Part A of the
study, completed in September 1976, confirmed the technical feasibility and
economic viability of Stage II, which consists of construction of the storage
dam and of additional irrigation facilities, to increase the service area to
102,000 ha, together with construction of a power station with an installed
capacity of 360 MW and the provision of generating and transmission equipment.
1.11      NIA began an extensive program of pre-construction work on the
Magat dam in 1976 with Government funding. Considerable progress has been
made on such items as construction of access roads, permanent camp facilities
and dam foundation grouting, and work on drainage gallery tunneling has begun.
The diversion tunnels are being built by a Philippines contractor. The main
civil works contract for the Magat dam was awarded in June 1978 after inter-
national competitive bidding to the same firm under the provisions of
Loan 1567-PH. Construction of the dam and appurtenant work is expected to be
completed by the end of 1982. The power component, consisting of the civil
works together with the supply and installation of penstocks, turbines,
generators, electrical and mechanical equipment, is expected to take four
years to implement (1979-1982). The development of the Stage II irrigation
potential, consisting of construction of the Baligatan diversion dam and
irrigation drainage and access facilities for about 26,770 ha of mostly
rainfed land, is the subject of the present report and the proposed Bank
loan. Implementation is scheduled to take four years (1979-82).
2. THE PROJECT AREA
General
2.01      The project is located in the Cagayan valley of Northern Luzon,
about 350 km northeast of Manila (Map No. 13283R). Stage I of the project
lies entirely in Isabela province and, even with the full development of
Stage II, the province would remain the principal beneficiary of the irri-
gation, as only a small portion of the irrigated area would touch Quirino
province. There are several small towns with populations between 5,000 and
10,000 people scattered throughout the area. The larger towns, including
the provincial capital of Ilagan which lies just outside the project area,
provide banking, storage and processing facilities as well as supplies of
inputs to the surrounding agricultural area. The project area is connected
by national highway to Central Luzon and Manila in the south and to the port
of Aparri on the Babuyan channel in the north.
Climate
2.02      The climate in the project area is tropical and monsoonal.  Warm
temperatures throughout the year, with minimum change from month-to-month,
allow a 12-month growing season with irrigation. Mean monthly temperatures
in the project service area range from 23.3 degrees centigrade in January

to 29.3 degrees centigrade in May. The hottest months are April, May and
June and the coldest months December and January. About 75% of the average
annual rainfall of 1,900 mm falls in the six-month period of July through
December with the heaviest precipitation in November and the least in
February. The occurrence of typhoons is also centered within the July-
December period with the highest frequency in September. Over a 24-year
period between 1948 and 1972 the area was struck by an annual average of 3.25
typhoons. No typhoons have been recorded for the months January through
March. The rainfall, together with river flows in the wet season, is gener-
ally adequate for a single rice crop. Dry-season cropping, however, entails
considerably more risk and irrigation is essential for an assured crop.
Topography, Drainage and Soils
2.03      The service area is located on alluvial terraces in the flood
plains of the Cagayan and Magat rivers and tributary streams. It is bounded
on the north by the Mallig river, on the east by the Cagayan river and on the
south and west by the foothills of the Caraballo mountains and the Cordillera
Central respectively. The general slope of the land is from west to north-
east. The proposed Stage II areas lie around the edges of the Stage I
development, with roughly half of the Stage II area curling along the south-
western border of the Stage I area, and the balance running along the north-
eastern edge of the Stage I development. The southeastern portion, or South
High Canal area, is intersected by a number of small tributaries of the
Cagayan river and shows gently rolling topography. About half of the north-
eastern section of the Stage II development is situated in flat land along
the left bank of the Cagayan river and the right bank of the Magat river.
The other half is located on the eroded watershed between the Siffu and Magat
rivers and is higher than the surrounding areas. Surface drainage is good in
all sections.
2.04      The predominant soil type in the South High Canal area fed from the
Baligatan diversion dam is a clay of the Cauayan series. Soils of this
series are located on the older alluvial terraces close to and running
parallel to the Cagayan river. The soil is a very dark grayish brown clay,
with a weak angular blocky structure, sticky when wet and friable when
dry. It has a slightly acidic reaction, poor internal drainage, and good
cation holding capacity. In the Cauayan East, Luna-Reina Mercedes and Siffu
East areas the most common soil is a clay loam of the Bago series. The soil
is a dark brown sandy clay loam, with a subangular blocky structure, friable
when dry and nonsticky when wet. The soil is slightly acidic, has poor
internal drainage and cation holding capacity. The soils are well suited to
rice which has been grown on them in the project area for many years without
problems.
Land Tenure and Farm Size
2.05      Since 1972 the Government has pursued a program of agrarian reform
aimed at the transfer of land ownership to tenant farmers on rice and corn
lands. Presidential Decree No. 27 (PD 27), the basic legislation of the new



program, provides for the transfer to the tenant, whether sharecropper or
leaseholder, of up to 3 ha in an irrigated area and 5 ha in a rainfed area.
According to PD 27, the landlord may retain up to 7 ha if he tills the land
himself. Since there are some 2 million rice and corn farmers on about 4
million ha, of which less than 1 million ha are irrigated, there is little
prospect of achieving the 5 ha rainfed and 3 ha irrigated family farms
nationwide. The Ministry of Agrarian Reform (MAR) completed the issue of
land transfer certificates to tenants for all lands in holdings over 24 ha in
1975. In November 1974, the Government decided to proceed with the transfer
of land in holdings between 24 and 7 ha. In October 1976, the Government
extended the provision of PD 27 to holdings of less than 7 ha, belonging to
landowners with more than 7 ha of other agricultural land, or belonging to
landowners with residential, commercial or urban land from which they derive
adequate incomes to support themselves. At present it is not known how many
landlords and tenants would be affected by the new legislation.
2.06      NIA surveys show that some 8,000 farm families, averaging six mem-
bers for a total of about 48,000 people, live in the Stage II area. The
average farm unit is 3.4 ha, but there is an unusually high degree of varia-
tion from the mean. Nearly one third of the farms are under 1.5 ha and cover
10% of the land, while at the other end of the range some 8% of the farms are
larger than 7.5 ha and occupy 31% of the area. In the more densely populated
and better developed Stage I area, the average farm size is 3.2 ha and there
is little divergence from the mean. The Stage II area is more backward and
largely rainfed. The farm size distribution is as follows!
Farm size            Farm holdings          Cultivated area
(ha)               …(--

Owner-operated farms at an average of 4.5 ha are nearly twice as large as
farms worked by tenant farmers which have a mean size of 2.4 ha.
2.07      According to MAR information the 26,770 ha in the project area
are owned by 6,580 people. The land ownership by size of holding is as
follows-

The pattern of land ownership in the various subproject areas is similar,
except in the Cauayan East Extension where the degree of skewness is more
accentuated. In this section 4% of the owners have holdings greater than
20 ha and account for 27% of the area. At present about half the farmers
own the land they are farming and account for 66% of the area, the rest are
tenant farmers. After completion of land reform some 21,000 ha, or 78% of
the project area, will be cultivated by about 5,400 owner-operators, equiv-
alent to 68% of the farmers (Table 2.2). The remaining 2,500 farmers would
operate under a written lease agreement.

Existing Irrigation Facilities
2.08      About 5,500 ha within the project area are currently irrigated, of
which 2,300 are gravity irrigated and 3,200 irrigated by small pumps. All
the gravity irrigated land is located in the service area of the proposed
South High Canal and is composed of 12 communal irrigation systems ranging
from 10 to 1,000 ha. These systems were built by NIA and are operated and
maintained by the farmers benefited by the systems. The level of facilities



- 9 -
in the systems is generally poor and maintenance is inadequate. There are
about 400 individually or communally owned pumps providing irrigation in the
project area. The pumps range from 3 to 8 inches in diameter and are driven
by diesel motors. The area under pump irrigation in the various subproject
sections is as follows:
South High Canal             1,985 ha
Siffu East Extension           770 ha
Luna-Reina Mercedes              30 ha
Cauayan East Extension         415 ha
Rice is the only crop grown on the irrigated areas. The cropping intensity
on the gravity irrigated land is 165% and 177% on the pump irrigated land.
Transportation
2.09      The Philippine-Japan Friendship Highway connecting Manila with the
port of Aparri on the Babuyan channel, passes through Santiago and the
southeastern part of the project area. The highway is concrete surfaced,
but is susceptible to damage from washouts and landslides due to heavy
rainfall during typhoons. The service area is well provided with national,
provincial and local access roads. The network of local access and service
roads is being upgraded and expanded by NIA under Stage I of the project,
while three provincial roads are being improved under the Chico River
Irrigation Project (Loan 1227-PH). Daily commercial air service to Manila is
available at the Cauayan airport about 35 km northeast of the dam site. In
addition NIA has built an airstrip with a 1,200 m long paved runway adjacent
to the MARIS diversion dam.

3. THE PROJECT
Project Description
3.01       The project proposed for Bank financing would include:
(a) construction of the Baligatan diversion dam;
(b) construction of irrigation and drainage facilities and roads
on a total area of about 26,770 ha of currently rainfed land;
(c) construction of three pumping stations to serve higher lands
covering 8,000 ha of the project area;
(d) supply and installation of pumps, motors, auxiliary equipment and
pipelines;
(e) provision of consulting services to assist NIA in design of the
pumping stations, and procurement, installation and testing of
pumping equipment; and
(f) procurement of vehicles and equipment for project implementation
and operation and maintenance.
Project Works
3.02       Baligatan Diversion Works.  The diversion dam located on Baligatan
creek about 3.5 km downstream of the Magat reservoir, would be a 272 m long
earth and rockfill embankment, with a central concrete overflow section 20 m
long and 14 m high. Top width of the embankment would be 8 m and the proposed
slope of the upstream face would be 2:1 and 1.7:1 for the downstream face.
On the right abutment there would be a sluice way with one 7 m wide and 5.3 m
high radial gate and an intake structure for diverting a flow of about 26.6
cu m/sec into the South High canal. An intake on the left bank would divert
a flow of 3.5 cu m/sec to the Oscariz canal.
3.03       Irrigation and Drainage Works.  The irrigation works would cover
four areas; the South High-Oscariz canals' area serving about 12,340 ha with
water diverted from the Baligatan diversion dam, the Cauayan East extension
area irrigating about 5,375 ha, the Luna-Reina Mercedes area serving about
2,455 ha and the Siffu East extension area of about 6,600 ha. The main and
secondary irrigation networks within the four service areas would consist
of about 150 km of main canals and about 290 km of laterals. Canals and
laterals would be unlined except for short lengths where the soils are
erosive. General features of the irrigation works would include water-
regulating and delivery structures, such as checks and turnouts to provide
water more efficiently to each field as needed. Constant head orifice
turnouts to sublaterals, or a water measuring and control device of an
equivalent nature, would be provided for water deliveries to one or two
rotational areas of about 50 ha each. Simple turnouts with flashboards would
be provided for each 10 ha unit, from which farm ditches, constructed as part
of the project, would convey water directly to most farms. Other farms would



- 11 -
receive water from field to field flooding.
3.04      Because of elevation, an area of about 1,340 ha in the Cauayan East
extension and 6,600 ha in the Siffu East extension would be irrigated by
pumping stations sited on canals. Three single stage, vertical mixed flow,
350 hp, 36 inch pumps, with individual capacities of 1,100 1/sec and a lift
of 14 m would serve the southeastern part of the Cauayan East extension. The
Siffu East extension area would be served by two pumping stations, a 7.5 m
primary lift station to supply the entire 6,600 ha extension area and a 15 m
lift booster station for the canal for the eastern 2,950 ha. The primary
station would be equipped with five single stage, vertical mixed flow, 500 hp,
54 inch pumps, with individual capacities of 3,200 1/sec. The booster
station would be equipped with five single stage, vertical mixed flow, 450 hp,
42 inch pumps with individual capacities of 1,500 1/sec. Each station would
be equipped with overhead hoists for repairs and maintenance of the pumps and
motors. To allow for independent operation of each unit during periods of
low demand, the intake channel from the canal to the pump would be multi-
barrelled, with the provision of gates, trashracks and stop log grooves at
the upper end of each barrel. The power for the pumping stations would be
supplied by the Isabela Electric Cooperative (ISELCO) through a 69 kV line
presently under construction between Ilagan and Santiago. The Cauayan East
station would be connected to the ISELCO line by a 8 km, 13.8 kV line, and
the Siffu East stations by a 13 km, 13.8 kV line. Both connecting lines,
together with the required transformers, would be provided under the project.
3.05      Gravel surfaced O&M roads would be constructed on the canal banks.
Canals with a design flow greater than 5 cu m/sec, would be provided with a
roadway 5 m wide on both banks, if the service area is on both sides of the
canal, and on one bank, where the canal serves the area on one side only.
In case of a roadway on both banks, only one bank would be gravel surfaced.
Canals with capacities between 2 and 5 cu m/sec would be provided with a
3.5 m wide roadway on one bank. The roadway along laterals with capacities
less than 2 cu m/sec and along some of the major farm ditches would be a
nongravel, 2 m wide cycle or cart path. However, as no roadway would be
built along these waterways if they were within 200 m of a parallel road,
access to the laterals would be provided by building 3.5 m wide connect-
ing roads 400-500 m apart.  About 160 km of access roads 5 m wide would also
be provided as links between the existing major roads of the area and the
canal O&M roads, and would also serve as farm-to-market roads. Gravel
surfacing would be provided on some of the major existing farm-to-market
roads. The surfacing would be 20 cm thick for 5 m wide roadways and 15 cm
thick for 3.5 m roadways. To allow continuous passage along the O&M roads,
bridges and/or culverts across the existing drainage channels would be built.
However, on major streams or rivers, the O&M roads would be connected to
existing bridges by short access roads instead of constructing expensive,
multispan bridges.
3.06      The proposed level of on-farm distribution and drainage is similar
to what is being implemented under Stage I (Loan 1154-PH). Rice has been
grown in the project area for many years and the land is reasonably level and



- 12 -
well laid out with little fragmentation of land holdings; therefore no land
leveling or boundary realignment would be provided. Farm drains would convey
excess water from each 10 ha unit to the main and secondary drains. Main and
secondary drains built under the project would be provided with gravel sur-
faced O&M roads of 3.5 to 5 m width on one bank. Working stations for Water
Management Technicians (WMT) would be built for approximately each 500 ha of
irrigated land in the project. The stations would provide space for temporary
storage and drying of paddy. Gatekeeper quarters would be constructed at the
major checks and turnouts of main canals, pumping stations and the Baligatan
diversion dam.
Water Supply Demand and Quality
3.07      Water Supply.  The sources of water would be the Magat reservoir,
impounding the runoff of the Magat river and Baligatan creek, and the Siffu
river at the existing SIFRIS diversion dam. These sources would serve about
102,000 ha in Stages I and II of the project. Continuous rainfall data are
available for two stations within the Magat watershed for the period 1948-77.
Reliable continuous discharge records for the Magat river near the proposed
dam site are available from 1948 to 1965. The record was extended a further
eight years to 1972 by the drainage area proportion method based on discharges
of a gauge upstream of the dam. Stream flow records of the Siffu river at a
site below the diversion dam are available for a 24 year period. The runoff
of the river at the diversion dam was estimated from the stream flow record
by the drainage area proportion method. The discharge records of the two
rivers are long enough to cover known critical water supply periods and are
considered reliable.
3.08      Water Demand.  It was assumed that transplated rice using 120-day
non-photosensitive varieties in both the wet and dry seasons would be the only
crop grown in the project area. Water requirements were based on the
cropping calendar shown in Table 3.1. Land preparation and nursery were
estimated to take 30 days with water requirements for saturation, evaporation
and percolation of 305 mm in the wet season and 325 mm in the dry season.
Flooding requirements to provide a minimum depth of water in the field for
cultivation in each season were estimated to be 20 mm immediately after
transplanting followed by an additional 50 mm about two weeks later. The
consumptive use of water for rice was estimated by the Class A Pan Evapo-
ration Method, using the pan evaporation record at Tuguegarao, Cagayan dating
from 1957 to 1968. Field percolation losses were estimated to be 2 mm per
day based on permeability studies in the project area. The effective rainfall
was determined from observed daily rainfall records at Ilagan, between 1953
and 1972, allowing water depth to fluctuate with the growth of rice plants
and limiting maximum depth to 150 mm. The overall irrigation efficiency was
estimated to be 39% in the wet season and 48% in the dry season at full
development, based on farm irrigation wastes of 42% in the wet season and 30%
in the dry season, system operation losses of 15% and canal conveyance losses
of 25%. Monthly project water requirements and the net monthly demand for
irrigation on the Magat reservoir, after using the mean of the five lowest
monthly discharges in the 20 year observation period at the Siffu diversion



- 13 -
dam for about 12,000 ha served directly by the Siffu river, are shown in
Table 3.1. Seasonal and total annual diversion requirements are shown in
Table 3.2.
3.09      Reservoir Operation Studies.  Reservoir operation studies were
performed for a 30-year period of record (1948-77) on the basis of a 360 MW
power plant, an irrigation service area of 102,000 ha, the operation rule
curve established under the Magat dam project (Loan 1567-PH) and the new
area capacity curve of May 1978 based on the revised reservoir size. The
operation rule curve assumes 25 MW of firm power and that the irrigation
demand of 102,000 ha will be met from three different sources with the
following priorities:
(a)  irrigation of up to 12,000 ha from the Siffu diversion dam
with any deficiency met from the Magat reservoir by releases
through the powerplant;
(b)  the combined area irrigated by the flow released through Magat
turbines and from the Siffu diversion dam would not exceed
89,600 ha; and
(c)  irrigation of up to 12,400 from the Magat reservoir through
the 3aligatan outlet would have the last priority after
meeting the demand of the 89,600 ha served by the Magat
releases.
3.10      The initial computer runs of the reservoir operation studies were
based on a cropping intensity of 200%, and showed shortages for the month of
May during the years 1954, 1955, 1958, 1959, 1963, 1969 and 1973. The
shortages were allocated wholly to the area served by the Baligatan outlet
during the seven years. In addition to the Baligatan shortages, an area of
about 23,000 ha irrigated from the Magat outlets would also suffer water
deficiencies during the years 1963 and 1969. Further analysis of data in the
seven critical years indicated that a shortage could be expected if the
reservoir fell below elevation 185 at the end of April. The ability to
predict a shortage would minimize the loss of crop, as only a small area would
be transplanted by the end of April, and there would be enough time to caution
farmers served from Baligatan and from the pumps in the Siffu East extension.
3.11      The operation studies indicate severe shortages once every four
years in the area irrigated through the Baligatan outlet and deficiencies
affecting about 25% of the area irrigated from the Magat outlets once
every 15 years. The shortages would reduce the average cropping intensity
to 197% for the total irrigable area of 102,000 ha. The water supply and
cropped area using average monthly flows for the seven critical years is
shown in Table 3.1 and summarized below:

3.12      Water Quality.  Tests of water samples from the Magat and Siffu
rivers indicate good water quality with total dissolved solids under 200 ppm.
The waters are of low salinity, slightly alkaline (pH 7-8), free of toxic
elements and can be considered as of excellent quality for irrigation.
Status of Engineering
3.13      Preliminary design and cost estimates of the Baligatan diversion
dam were prepared by the consultants. Foundation investigations have been
completed and detail designs for this structure are being prepared by NIA
with consultant assistance. Project planning studies, designs and estimates
of the irrigation and drainage works were prepared by the NIA project
design office in Cauayan. The designs of the main and secondary systems of
the Luna-Reina Mercedes and Cauayan East extensions, covering about 8,000 ha
or 30% of the Stage II, area are well advanced and ready for bidding, and the
cost estimates are based on detail design. For the remaining area of about
19,000 ha preliminary profiles of main and secondary canals were prepared on
the basis of 1:4000 scale, 50 cm contour topographic maps, and the alignment
verified in the field. Quantities and costs were estimated from the prelimi-
nary canal profiles. Drainage and on-farm facilities costs were based on
unit quantity estimates per hectare for each major item obtained from
sample areas typical of the project area and verified by comparison with
similar works in the Stage I area.   O&M roads were based on canal capacity
and access needs within the service area and were checked in the field to
ensure that adequate access to project works would be provided. The esti-
mates include provision for access roads to link canal service roads and
existing major roads. Preliminary layouts and designs for each pumping
station were prepared and the cost estimates were based on quotations from
pumping equipment suppliers.

Sufficient investigations have been made to ensure that suitable materials
are available for construction of the Baligatan diversion dam and the canal
embankments.
3.14      Topographic maps of 1:4,000 scale are available for about 40% of
the area, and maps for the remaining area would be completed before the end
of 1978.  The maps would be used for detailed planning and design of on-farm
facilities (paras. 3.03 and 3.06), and the distribution and drainage systems
in the project area. Construction of the irrigation and drainage works would
begin in early 1980, with pre-construction activities starting at the end of
1978 (see Figure 3.1). All project works are expected to be completed by the
end of 1982.

Cost Estimates
3.15      Total project costs are estimated at US$62.0 million, of which
US$27.0 million or 43% is foreign exchange. For civil works quantity esti-
mates are based on the feasibility designs, and unit prices are those
prevailing in the Stage I area in December 1977, indexed to December 1978,
which is the base cost level for the project. Prices include about 6% for
taxes. Unit prices for imported equipment, materials and supplies are based
on recent quotations received by NIA, which include a provision of about 5%
for duties. NIA's cost for design and construction supervision are included
under engineering. A physical contingency factor of 15% was used for civil
works and 10% for pumping equipment and materials. Costs due to expected
price increases over the implementation period amount to about 15% of the
base cost plus physical contingencies, assuming the following annual infla-
tion rates:

Financing
3.17      The Bank loan of US$21.0 million and the IFAD loan of US$10.0
million would finance the full foreign exchange costs and about 11% of the
local costs of the project. The loans would cover 50% of total project
costs. The proposed IFAD loan would be administered by the Bank acting as a
Cooperating Institution under terms of the Cooperative Agreement between IFAD
and the Bank dated May 20, 1978. The Government would provide the remaining
P 229.4 million (US$31.0 million) to NIA through annual budget appropriations.
Procurement
3.18      Pumps, motors, transformers and auxiliary equipment for the pumping
stations; together with equipment, vehicles, spare parts and supplies for
force account construction and O&M, costing about US$6.7 million, would be
procured after international competitive bidding in accordance with Bank
Group Guidelines. A preference limited to 15% of the c.i.f. price of imported
goods, or the custom duty, whichever is lower would be extended to the local
manufacturers in the evaluation of bids. Local procurement practices are
appropriate for off-the-shelf items costing less than US$10,000 each because
the advantages of international competitive bidding would be clearly outweighed
by the administrative costs involved. The total cost for such items would
not exceed US$200,000. Bank staff have reviewed the local procedures and
they are acceptable. There is adequate competition and foreign firms can
participate. A list of equipment requirement is given in Annex 1.
3.19      Construction of the Baligatan diversion dam, together with intake
structures, main canal with major laterals and service roads of the South
High Canal area, (US$8.0 million) would be let as one contract, subject
to international competitive bidding. The remaining civil works in the
project service area (US$36.0 million) would be scattered over four separate
locations and, due to the nature of work, split into about 20 contracts and
would not be suitable for international competitive bidding. In the past,
NIA experienced considerable difficulty in attracting bids for such works.
Over the last four years several steps have been taken on Bank-assisted
projects to strengthen local contractors, including financing of reconditioned
equipment and providing mobilization allowances, as a result of which there
has been an encouraging response on the recent bids. However, it is doubtful
that all civil works could be done by contract and some of them would therefore
be carried out on force account. Nevertheless, in light of NIA's large work
program in the years ahead, it would not be desirable to expand its force
account work too rapidly. In previous Bank-assisted irrigation projects
outside of Central Luzon, the amount of civil works done by force account was
set at 40% of total cost, as this was found to provide the optimum combina-
tion of force account and contract work. An assurance was obtained that the
amount of civil works carried out by force account would not exceed 40% of
the total cost of civil works excluding those subject to ICB. Competitive
bidding in accordance with local procedures is appropriate for the balance of
the work. Bank staff have reviewed the local procedures and they are acceptable.
There is potentially adequate competition and foreign firms would be allowed
to participate.



- 20 -
Disbursements
3.20      Disbursements from the Bank loan and the IFAD loan, apportioned in
the ratio of 21:10 against each withdrawal application, would be made at the
rate of 100% of the foreign exchange cost of the directly imported equipment,
and 100% of the ex-factory price of locally manufactured equipment and 65%
for imported equipment procured locally. Disbursement for civil works would
be 45% of certified monthly progress payments on expenditures which exclude
mobilization and equipment costs. Disbursements for force account works
would be made against certificates of expenditure, the documentation for
which would not be submitted to the Bank for review, but would be retained by
the borrower and made available for inspection by the Bank's supervision
mission. For civil works contractors' mobilization and equipment, disbursement
would be at the rate of 100% of foreign exchange cost. For costs of consultants,
disbursements would be at the rate of 100% of total costs.
3.21      Disbursement of the Bank and IFAD loans would be against import docu-
mentation, contracts and certified records of payment or expenditure. It is
expected that disbursements would be completed by December 31, 1983, approximately
one year after the end of construction. In consultation with the Bank and
IFAD, savings under the project would be used to finance similar additional
work in the project area. An estimated schedule of expenditures, a semi-annual
disbursement schedule and a proposed allocation of the proceeds of the loans
are given in Annex 1.
Accounts and Audit
3.22      The NIA is a Government agency and its accounts are audited annually
by the Government's Commission on Audit. Assurances were obtained that NIA
would maintain separate accounts for the project and that after audit by the
Commission on Audit, the project accounts, together with the auditors' comments
and opinion on the certification of expenditure for force account work, would
be sent to the Bank within six months of the close of each financial year.
Input-Output Monitoring
3.23      A program of input-output monitoring was established under the
Chico Irrigation Project (Loan 1227-PH) with the objectives of (a) monitoring
the flow and build-up of farm inputs in each Bank-assisted project area
before and during each crop season to give NIA sufficient warning of any
shortfall and allow it to take appropriate action; and (b) monitoring the
amount and distribution of benefits in each project area. The program, which
has been in operation in the Upper Pampanga River Irrigation System service
area for about two years with useful results, would apply to the project
area. Consultants assisting in setting up the monitoring program were
financed under Loan 1227-PH and no additional funding is required.
Environmental Effects
3.24      The development of irrigation and drainage under this project is
not expected to have any significant effect on the environment. There is no
schistosomiasis in the project area or in Northern Luzon generally. Malaria



- 21 -
is effectively controlled by a Government program of house spraying with
residual insecticides. The few cases reported are brought into the project
area from the sparsely populated, mountainous forest regions bordering the
Cagayan valley. The principal public health problems in the area are protein
deficiencies in pre-school children, enteric diseases and tuberculosis. The
proposed project would have little direct impact on these.

4. ORGANIZATION AND MANAGEMENT
Project Management
4.01      NIA was created in 1964 and given responsibilities for developing,
operating and maintaining all national irrigation systems in the Philippines.
The Government finances NIA through the sale of bonds or from appropriations.
A board of directors is responsible for the agency and the Administrator,
who is appointed by the President of the Philipines, handles management.
NIA has recently been reorganized to better deal with the requirements of
the Government's policy of irrigation development. The integration of the
major foreign-assisted projects under a Special Projects Organization
(SPO) headed by an Assistant Administrator was one of the first results of
the reorganization (Figure 4.1). The SPO is currently responsible for
twelve major projects and has built-up a structure of staff which, with
specialist consultant input where necessary, is competent to implement
large-scale projects and manage the operations and maintenance of irriga-
tion works.
4.02      Responsibility for implementation of Stage I of the MRMP (Loan
1154-PH) was given to the SPO. A Project Manager was appointed with an
Assistant Project Manager directly in charge of three construction divisions,
dealing respectively with the ADB-assisted rehabilitation of MARIS and the
Bank-assisted MARIS extension and SIFRIS rehabilitation and expansion.
The MRMP Project Manager subsequently assumed overall responsibility for
the construction of the nearby Chico River Irrigation Project (Loan 1227-PH)
and for the Cagayan Integrated Area Development project, with day to day
responsibility for MRMP in the hands of an Assistant Project Manager.
Since completion of the ADB-assisted work at the end of 1977, responsibilities
between the three construction divisions have been reallocated and all are
now working on the Bank-assisted portion of Stage I. Responsibilities for
construction of Stage II would be split up among the three existing
divisions. The Santiago based Division I would carry out construction in
the South High Canal area of 12,345 ha. Division II, based in San Mateo,
would build the Cauayan East and Luna-Reina Mercedes extensions, totaling
7,825 ha. Division III, with headquarters at San Manuel, would be responsible
for construction of the 6,600 ha Siffu East extension (Figure 4.2).
4.03      For O&M purposes there would be no distinction between Stages I
and II and the entire project area of about 102,000 ha would be adminis-
tered by a single Project Manager (Figure 4.3). There would be four
support divisions, dealing with administration, equipment, agricultural
development and operation of the Magat and MARIS dams. The project area
would be divided into three Irrigation Districts based on Santiago, San
Mateo and San Manuel. Each district would be divided into 50 ha irrigation
units. A ditchtender would supervise two such units (100 ha), while a
Water Management Technician (WMT) would control five ditchtenders (500 ha).
A supervisor would be responsible for a water management division which
includes five WMTs (2,500 ha). Three to four divisions would constitute a
zone under a Superintendent. The Santiago District would have three zones
the San Mateo District four, and the San Manuel District two.



- 23 -
4.04      At completion of Stage II construction, about 54 WMTs would be
required. Most of the technicians would be newly recruited graduates in
agriculture or in agricultural engineering, although some might be promoted
from the ranks of competent and experienced ditchtenders. All WMTs,
whether directly recruited or promoted to the post, would undergo a
one-year training program in water management, crop production and farmer
organization at the regional training center at Cauayan being run by the
SPO.
Consulting Services
4.05      Over the last ten years in the course of implementing a substantial
irrigation development program, NIA has acquired a considerable amount of
expertise in the planning, design and construction of large irrigation
projects. However, all these projects have consisted of gravity irrigation
systems and NIA has little experience in the planning and design of large
pumping stations. The project would provide for consulting services to
assist NIA in planning and design of the three pumping stations, preparation
of specifications for the procurement of the equipment, evaluation of bids,
and supervision of the installation and testing of the equipment. It is
estimated that about 20 man-months of consulting services would be required
at an average overall cost of US$10,000 per man-month, consisting of a billing
rate (including home-office overhead) of US$8,000 per man-month, international
travel expenses of US$500 per man-month, and local expenses of US$1,500 per
man-month. An assurance was obtained that NIA would engage consultants
satisfactory to the Bank under terms of reference and conditions agreed with
the Bank.
Agricultural Supporting Services
4.06      Extension.  An Agricultural Development Coordinating Council
(ADCC) was established under Stage I of the project to coordinate the work
of the various agencies providing services to the farmers. The ADCC is
chaired by the provincial Governor and consists of the provincial heads of
all Government or parastatal agencies dealing with the farmers. The MRMP
Council has been very active since its establishment in 1976 and would
extend its activities to the Stage II areas. Several agencies provide
extension services of one kind or another to the farming population.
Included among them are the Ministry of Agriculture through the Bureau
of Agricultural Extension (BAE) and the Bureau of Plant Industry (BPI),
the Ministry of Agrarian Reform (MAR) and the Ministry of Local Government
and Community Development (MLGCD). The BAE provides by far the largest
number of technicians, all of whom are graduates. Over the entire project
area of 102,000 ha the ratio of BAE extension workers to farmers is about
1:190. The water management staff (para 4.03) would be additional to the
existing extension personnel provided by the various Government agencies and
would facilitate the diffusion of information to the farmers.
4.07      Research.  There are two BPI research stations in Isabela province,
the Cagayan Valley station at San Mateo and the Ilagan station at Ilagan.
The former deals principally with rice and the other with upland crops.



- 24 -
The work on rice is focused on varietal screening, foundation seed produc-
tion and pure seed certification.  In addition to the two BPI stations
there is a Bureau of Soils unit, based at Ilagan, working on fertilizers,
soil fertility and soil erosion. The Agricultural Department of the SPO
has excellent and long standing working relations with the International
Rice Research Institute, the College of Agriculture of the University of
the Philippines and the Central Luzon State University. The project would
be able to draw on all these sources for research backup.
4.08      Fertilizer.  Annual fertilizer consumption in the Stage II
project area amounts to about 1,900 tons. About 50% is in the form of
urea and sulphate of ammonia and the balance is evenly divided between
ammonium phosphate and 14-14-14. Application rates are extremely low in
the rainfed rice areas and only marginally higher in the irrigatd areas.
At full development the project would require about 9,700 tons of ferti-
lizer, consisting of 6,600 tons of urea and 3,100 tons of triple super-
phosphate. In terms of nutrients the average application per crop season
would be about 60 kg/ha nitrogen and 30 kg/ha phosphoric acid. Potash
would not be required. There is a good existing distribution network for
fertilizers and agrochemicals of some 55 dealers in the project munici-
palities, which could handle the additional demand.
4.09      Seed.  Annual consumption of rice seed in the Stage II area
amounts to about 1,800 tons. About 65% of the seed is obtained by reten-
tion from the farmers' commercial production and the balance is purchased
from seed growers registered with BPI. Within the existing MARIS and
SIFRIS systems there are some 60 registered seed growers on about 470 ha,
providing 2,240 tons of certified seed in 1978.  At full development, the
entire service area would use approximately 9,975 tons of rice seed per
annum, of which 7,500 tons in Stage I and 2,475 tons in Stage II. Follow-
ing on improved seed quality and water control, the current seed rate of
60 to 65 kg/ha is expected to fall to 50 kg/ha. Assuming that rice seed
would be renewed every four crop seasons, the estimated annual requirement
of certified seed for the entire service area at full development would
amount to 5,000 tons, consisting of 3,760 tons for Stage I and 1,240 for
Stage II. At a seed yield estimate of 4 ton/ha and allowing a safety
factor, about 1,300 ha of certified seed production would be required to
meet the project needs. No difficulties are anticipated in expansion of
seed growing capacity in the MRMP, as there is an excellent foundation on
which to build and the BPI station at San Mateo is well qualified to
provide the necessary technical support and certification facilities.
4.10      Farmers' Organizations.  As part of the Agrarian Reform program,
the Government, through the Ministry of Local Government and Community
Development (MLGCD), is promoting the formation of pre-cooperative farmer
organizations, based on a barrio or hamlet. The organizations would serve
as channels for the inflow of technical services, credit and inputs and as
assembly points for produce intended for markets. It is expected that
these organizations will eventually grow into full-fledged, formally



- 25 -
constituted cooperatives. This approach to cooperative organization fits
in well with the NIA effort to set up irrigators' associations based
initially on the 50 ha irrigation units.
4.11      Credit.  Under the Masagana program the Government has eased credit
to small farmers, previously dependent on the landlords and private lenders
for their requirements. A system of uncollateralized "supervised credit" is
used, which includes the provision of technical services to the borrower to
ensure that recommended practices, such as variety, fertilizer and agrochemical
inputs are adopted. The Masagana credit program has run into difficulties as
a result of poor repayment of previous loans and is now being reviewed by the
Government with a view to devising means of overcoming the current problems.
Within the presently irrigated MARIS and SIFRIS areas of MRMP an average of
about 30% of the farmers, accounting for 25% of the area, have been receiving
Masagana loans over the last two years. The program has accommodated smaller
farmers, as the average size of farm of the Masagana recipients was 2.4 ha
compared to the average farm size in the two irrigation systems of 3.2 ha.
The mean size of loan was P 770/ha or P 1,830 per farm. At full development
it is assumed that 50% of the farmers, covering 38% of the land, would
require credit from official sources at the current maximum rate of P 1,350/ha.
On this basis the annual requirement for the Stage II area would amount to
@ 24.0 million (US$3.2 million), of which P 12.9 million for the wet season
crop and P 11.1 million for the dry season crop. The total annual requirement
for the entire MRMP service area is estimated at P 101.6 million (US$13.7 mil-
lion), of which P 51.9 million in the wet season and P 49.7 in the dry
season. Under the provisions of Loan 1526-PH the Ministry of Agriculture
and NIA are preparing a plan of action for submission to the Bank by June 30,
1979, aimed at the provision of effective agricultural supporting services,
including production credit, on Bank-assisted irrigation projects. The plan
of action would cover the MRMP service area.

5. AGRICULTURAL PRODUCTION
Present Cropping Pattern
5.01      The wet season irrigated rice cultivated in the existing communal
and pump irrigation systems is grown between July and January. Transplanting
is spread over an eight-week period between July and September and harvesting
takes place over a similar period between mid-November and mid-January. The
dry season crop is grown between November and May, with the bulk of the
transplanting in December-January and the harvest in April and May. The
rainfed wet season crop generally lags between four and six weeks behind the
irrigated wet season crop. While a majority of farmers adheres to the time-
tables given above, there is a considerable degree of slippage, particularly
in the irrigated areas. As a result, all stages of crop growth can be found
in the project area throughout the year. All rice is transplanted from field
nurseries on to puddled land and direct sowing is not practiced. About 15%
of the area under wet season irrigated rice is cropped to modern short-strawed,
high-yielding varieties. In the dry season irrigated crop the area under
improved varieties rises to 95%. On the other hand, in the rainfed areas the
reliance on the less demanding and tougher traditional varieties is much
greater and the modern varieties only account for 34% of the area. In
addition to rice, which is by far the most important crop in the area, there
is some tobacco, corn and vegetable growing, but most of this is on the
better drained soils in the immediate flood plain of the Magat and Cagayan
rivers, outside the boundaries of the proposed project.
Future Cropping Patterns
5.02      No significant changes in cropping patterns would be likely in the
absence of the project. Under the project some 26,770 ha of rice land would
be provided with wet season irrigation, of which 21,270 are currently rain
fed. Improved facilities in the irrigation systems, better water management
and the storage provided by Magat dam would allow dry-season cropping of rice
to increase from the current 3,925 ha to 23,825 ha. Cropping intensity in the
Stage II project area would rise from the existing level of 115% to 189%.
Cropping intensity for the combined Stage I and II areas would be 197%. The
changes in cropping intensity for individual subproject areas within Stage II
would be as follows:
Cropping Intensity (x)
Present      Future
South High Canal                             124          188
Siffu East Extension I                       117          193
Siffu East Extension II                      100          193
Luna-Reina Mercedes                          101          193
Cauayan East Gravity                         108          193
Cauayan East Pump                            100          193



- 27 -
The lower future intensity in the South High Canal area would be due to
allocation of periodic dry season water shortages to the Baligatan outlets
feeding the area (para. 3.09).
Yields and Production
5.03      In the absence of the project, the rate of increase in rice yields
in the rainfed areas is estimated at about 0.8% p.a., while in the irrigated
areas yields are expected to rise by about 1.8% p.a. Yield increases in the
rainfed areas would be due to a small expansion of the area under high-yielding
varieties, while in the irrigated areas increases would be due to some improve-
ment in inputs, which would tend to be off-set by deterioration in the already
poor irrigation and drainage facilities. Greatly improved water control as a
result of the project, together with adequate supplies of inputs and credit
and an increased and better organized extension service, would raise rice yields
in both wet- and dry-season crops. The improved yields would be obtained from
more thorough land preparation through greater use of machinery, better
scheduling of operations, use of certified seed, heavier fertilizer input and
improved weed and pest control. Present and projected paddy yields are shown
in Table 5.1. Many farmers in the ADB-assisted Stage I-A area, where construc-
tion was completed in 1977, are already obtaining the anticipated, full
development yield levels.

5.04      At full project development in 1987 production in the Stage II area
would increase from about 50,000 tons of paddy at present to an estimated

would rise from a current production of about 239,000 tons to 817,000 tons at
full development (Table 5.2).

Cropping Calendar
5.05      Close adherence to a cropping calendar is essential for successful
and continued double cropping, as well as for the avoidance of technical and
organizational bottlenecks and to provide an effective basis for extension and
water management. A proposed calendar is incorporated in Table 3.1. The main
differences betveen the proposed and existing practices are to be found in the
shift of the dry-season crop from November-May to a shorter period in March-
August. This would allow a 30-day period for system maintenance in February,
the driest month of the year. Operations for the wet season crop would gain
momentum in October -November instead of in August-September. The later start
would allow for fuller utilization of peak rainfall. The proposed calendar
would also permit harvesting of the wet-season crop to take place under drier
conditions than at present. It would also ensure that the crop was at the
least vulnerable stage during the month of September when the typhoon risk is
at its highest.
Farm Mechanization
5.06      At present some 85% of the rainfed area relies entirely on animal-
drawn equipment for land preparation. In the irrigated areas machinery is
used for cultivation on about 35% of the area in the wet season crop and 25%
in the dry season crop. With better water management, improved access to the
fields, the need for tighter scheduling of operations to maximize water use
and greatly increased cropping intensities, it is estimated that the use of
machinery would increase to about 90% of land preparation for both wet and



- 29 -
dry season crops. It is anticipated that the machinery, both two and
four-wheel tractors and rotary tillers, would be largely owned by farmers
and contracted out to their neighbors, as is already being done. Within
the MRMIP municipalities there are currently about 3,400 two-wheel and 200
four-wheel tractors engaged in rice cultivation, most of which are concen-
trated in the more developed Stage I area. Harvesting of the crop is
manual, by sickle, while threshing is either manual or by mechanical
threshers. At present only 15% of the rain fed area is threshed mechani-
cally, while machinery is used on 30% of the irrigated crop in the wet
season and 45% in the dry season. Under project conditions of much better
access to the fields and improved field drainage, it is assumed that some
90% of the cropped area would be threshed mechanically. This would not
present any difficulties as there is a flourishing and enterprising con-
tracting industry already in existence in the Stage I project area with
about 120 large threshers in operation, which can be expected to expand to
meet additional requirements.
Drying, Storage and Processing
5.07      The bulk of threshed paddy is currently sun-dried on whatever
suitable surfaces are available. Virtually all the mills have concrete drying
floors and there is a program sponsored by the MLGCD to build a multipurpose
concrete paved area in every barrio to be used for sport, recreation and crop
drying. There are already some 40,000 m sq of such drying floors in the MRMP
project area. There are in addition 15 small mechanical dryers, which are
underutilized because of high fuel costs. Existing arrangements are adequate
for the present level of production. The project would provide additional
solar drying capacity attached to the WMT stations. A further expansion in
drying facilities, both solar and mechanical, would be required to deal with
the greatly increased output of the dry season crop that would be harvested in
the potentially wet months of July and August. The National Grains Authority
(NGA) is currently engaged in a program to encourage the expansion of drying
facilities in both the privae and public sector. Storage capacity within the
project area is adequate for present production, but would need to be expanded
to meet the increased yields. In addition to on-farm storage, there are over
200 storage facilities within the MRMP service areas. The NGA plans to build
additional storage and private entrepreneurs are expected to follow suit to
accommodate the expanding paddy production from the project.
5.08      There are about 365 privately owned rice mills and hullers in the
combined Stage I and II project areas. Assuming a 200-day milling season,
these mills have an annual capacity of about 335,000 tons of paddy, compared
to the present MRSP project area production of about 239,000 tons. No diffi-
culties are anticipated in providing the extra milling capacity needed at full
development, as the private sector is enterprising and has ready access to
sources of capital.

6. MARKET PROSPECTS, PRICES, FARM INCOMES AND PROJECT CHARGES
Market Prospects
6.01      A major Government objective is to increase rice production as a
means of raising the incomes of small farmers and of attaining national
self-sufficiency in food grains. After experiencing substantial deficits in
the early 1970s, rice production grew by 5% p.a. during crop years 1974-77
and the Philippines was able to provide for consumption solely from domestic
production during the crop years 1975-77. In 1977/78 the Government exported
90,000 tons and built up a supply of about three months. The good performance
in the past three years has been due mainly to an increase in yields brought
about by favorable weather, with the 1977 production being 235,000 tons above
the long-term trend. With the continued growth of population and incomes,
the demand for rice is expected to rise by about 3.0% annually. Based on a
projected growth of 3.7% in production and under average weather conditions,
the Philippines is expected to achieve sustained self-sufficiency by 1982 and
to have a surplus of between 350,000 and 375,000 tons by 1990.  Assuming that
the Philippines achieves self-sufficiency by the mid-1980s, there would be no
problems in exporting the incremental production from the project to nearby
rice-deficit countries such as Indonesia.
Prices
6.02      Since 1957 the Government has set an annual farm-gate support
price for paddy to encourage production and allow some purchases of paddy by
Government to build stabilization stocks. Responsibility for operating the
system through purchases in the market is vested in a statutory body, the
National Grains Authority (NGA). Through 1972, the farm-gate support price
for paddy and the domestic consumer price for rice kept pace with changes in
the world market price for rice. Between 1972 and 1975, to keep domestic
prices down in the face of record high world market prices for rice, the
Government subsidized consumers by maintaining a low official ceiling price
for rice and a correspondingly low farm-gate price for paddy by sales of
imported rice on the domestic market below cost. Since 1975, the official
support price and the import parity prices have been practically the same.
6.03      According to the Bank's commodity price forecasts, the world
market price of Thai 5% broken rice is expected to rise (in constant end-1978
prices) from US$320/ton f.o.b. Bangkok in 1978 to US$431/ton in 1987 and
US$440/ton in 1990. The quality of rice likely to be exported by the Philip-
pines in the mid-1980s is 25-35% broken, which historically trades at a 30%
discount from the price of 5% broken rice. On this basis the world market
price of Thai 25-35% broken is expected to rise from US$223/ton in 1978 to
US$302/ton in 1987 and US$308/ton in 1990. The economic and financial
paddy farm-gate price calculations, assuming that paddy production on the
project would be exported, are shown in Table 6.1 for 1987, the year full
development is reached.

Farm Incomes
6.05      Farm models were prepared for three farm types, based on water
supply, in the South High Canal subproject area and for four types in the
other subproject areas. The budgets for each farm type in the South High
Canal area were prepared for representative sizes of 2.5 ha, 3.5 ha and
13.0 ha and for various types of tenure. In the other subproject areas farm
budgets for each farm type were prepared for representative sizes of 2.5 ha
and 3.5 ha and for various types of tenure. These are presented in detail
in Annex 2 and summarized below.

3.5   Rainfed   4,635    20,135    625    2,720    2,095    340
6.06      The above farm models represent owner-operated farms, which after
completion of the land reform are expected to account for 68% of the farms
and 78% of the land (para. 2.07). The remaining farms would be operated by



- 33 -
leaseholders and, after rent payment, the respective annual incomes on these
farms would be lower by from US$720 to US$750 for a 2.5 ha farm and from
US$1,010 to US$1,075 for a 3.5 ha farm than that from an owner-operated farm,
depending on the location of the farm. Furthermore, in the initial phases
of the project some of the owner-operators would still have to make payments
for land acquired under the land reform, and thus their incomes would also
be less than the figures shown above.
6.07      The present per capita incomes for 2.5 ha farms range from US$65
for an amortizing owner of a rainfed farm to US$155 for an owner-operator
of an irrigated farm. These incomes are below the estimated per capita
absolute poverty level of US$200 (end-1978 prices) and vary from 12% to 30%
of the estimated 1978 per capita GNP of US$525 for the Philippines. With
the project, the per capita incomes of these farms would range from about
US$210 for a leaseholder to US$330 for an owner-operator. Thus incomes of
these farms would rise above the 1978 absolute poverty income level, and
range from 27% to 43% of the 1987 projected per capita GNP of US$771.
6.08      For 3.5 ha farms, the average farm size in the project area, the
present per capita incomes range from US$70 for an amortizing owner of a
rainfed farm to US$195 for an owner-operator of an irrigated farm. These
incomes are below the per capita absolute poverty level and vary from 13% to
37% of the estimated 1978 per capita GNP. With the project, the per capita
incomes would range from about US$265 for a leaseholder to about US$440 for
an owner-operator. Incomes of these farms would, therefore, rise above the
1978 absolute povery income level and range between 34% and 57% of the 1987
projected per capita GNP.
6.09      For 13.0 ha farms, representing 8% of the farmers and 31% of the
area, present per capita incomes range form US$185 to US$535 (35% to 102% of
1978 per capita GNP). With the project, the per capita incomes of these
farms would increase to US$1,375, about 78% above the estimated 1987 per
capita GNP. While an example of a larger farm is given for illustrative
purposes and to conform with the existing farm size distribution, such farms
are not expected to account for a significant area by the time the project
reaches full development in 1987. The changeover from extensive rainfed
cropping to highly intensive irrigated agriculture would put a substantial
strain on the larger farmers, in terms of managerial ability and access to
inputs, and it would tend to accelerate the process of subdivision of the
farms amongst descendants, which is inevitable in view of the family sizes
and traditional inheritance practices. NIA would review land tenure patterns
on an annual basis as part of the water fee billing procedure and would also
monitor the size and distribution of project benefits as part of the regular
input-output monitoring.
6.10      These comparisons indicate that the project would increase incomes
of a large number of poor farmers in the project area and would help narrow
the income gap between the project area and other parts of the country, and
between urban and rural areas.

Cost and Rent Recovery
6.11       NIA has the authority to collect fees from users of irrigation
systems to finance operations and to reimburse construction costs. Irrigation
charges on national systems other than those which are assisted by the Bank
are 2.0 cavans (100 kg) of paddy per hectare in the wet season and 3.0
cavans/ha (150 kg) in the dry season. On Bank-assisted projects, the charge
of 3.5 cavans (175 kg) of paddy per hectare in the wet season and 4.4 cavans
(220 kg) in the dry season, is to be achieved gradually over five years from
completion of construction. Since the average farm size in the MRMP is
somewhat larger than in other Bank-assisted projects and the project would
provide a more reliable supply of water, the Government, under the provisions
of Loan 1567-PH, has agreed to an increase of water charges of one cavan of
paddy per hectare in each season over the standard charges for Bank-assisted
projects. This increase would be implemented over five years after full
development, that is, from year 6 to year 10 after completion of construc-
tion. In accordance with existing NIA practice, farmers in the pump-
irrigated areas would pay for the electricity consumed by the pumps in
addition to these water charges.
6.12       Based on the above water charges, the rent recovery index was
examined for different farm types, sizes and tenures. Since the rent
recovery index varies negligibly with the size of the farm, indices have
been presented for owner-operated and leaseholder operated 3.5 ha farms
(Table 6.4). The incremental rent recovery index for the project benefi-
ciaries ranges from 18% for an owner-operator on a rainfed farm to 74% for a
leaseholder presently on a run-of-the-river communal irrigation system. The
average incremental rent recovery index of 24% is comparable to that in other
Bank-assisted irrigation projects in the Philippines.
6.13       The cost recovery analysis has assumed that 12.5% of the dam
cost (based on the Separable Costs-Remaining Benefits method, Annex 2)
should be allocated to the project. Taking the present value of the incre-
mental water charges, project costs, allocated dam costs, and annual O&M
costs, the cost recovery index is 14.0%. The index is smaller than those in
other Bank-assisted projects in the Philippines primarily due to high capital
costs of the project (para. 7.01). The cost recovery index for the MRMP
irrigation component, i.e. Stages I and II, is also 14.0%.

7. BENEFITS, JUSTIFICATION AND RISKS
Stage II Irrigation
7.01      The proposed project would increase yields on about 26,770 ha
of land, of which 21,270 ha are curently rainfed, by providing an assured
year-round water supply, improved infrastructure and better supporting
services. The project would be the last in a series of Bank and ADB-assisted
projects aimed at developing the irrigation potential of the Magat river
valley. Approximately 8,000 farm families and 4,400 landless laborer's
families, a total of about 77,000 people, would benefit directly from
increased production and consequent employment. The project would create a
demand for an additional 2.14 million man-days of farm labor per year
equivalent to some 8,900 full-time jobs. About 92% of the project bene-
ficiaries lie in the target group. The project's per ha cost of US$3,535,
excluding costs due to expected price increases but including a portion of
the Magat dam costs (para. 6.13), is considerably higher than in previous
Bank-assisted projects because of the high proportion of new construction and
the cost of reservoir storage, which amounts to US$1,525/ha. The project
would meet the Government's objectives of increased food production and
development of the depressed Cagayan valley at a capital cost per benefitted
family of about US$11,830 including the cost of storage and US$6,725 net of
storage cost. At full agricultural development the project would result in
rice exports worth US$24.9 million per year at forecast world market prices.
After deducting the incremental cost of imported fertilizer, chemicals and
fuel, the net foreign exchange value would be about US$20.3 million.
7.02      Foreign Exchange.  The numeraire used for this analysis is real
income, measured in terms of foreign exchange, expressed in US dollars at
constant end-1978 prices. All local costs and benefits denominated in pesos
have been multiplied by the Standard Conversion Factor (SCF) of 0.9/1 and
divided by the official exchange rate of P 7.40 = US$1.00 to convert
them to the numeraire.
7.03      Investment Costs.  While it is not strictly possible to give an
economic rate of return for this project since it is part of a multi-stage
multipurpose project, the rate of return on the incremental irrigation
investment in Stage II is the best indicator of the economic viability of
the project. While the Stage II investment (both irrigation and power) was
evaluated in an earlier report,/2 the following analysis will focus on
evaluating the incremental irrigation investment in Stage II, a part of which
is the proposed project. The capital cost of the Magat high dam including
power facilities is expected to be US$382 million with an annual operation
and maintenance cost of US$2.10 million. If the power facilities at Magat
were not built, a combination of a 100 MW steam power plant and a 200 MW gas
turbine plant would be the least cost alternative investment to provide the
same output as Magat. The capital cost of the steam plant, with an economic
life of 25 years, has been estimated at US$45.1 million, and for the gas
turbine plant, with a life of 15 years, at US$50.9 million. Annual operating

costs of the plants has been estimated at US$30.64 million./1 By building
the power plants there would be a saving of US$11.4 million in capital costs
for transmission and US$0.11 million annually for operation and maintenance of
the transmission facilities compared with the costs of power transmission from
the dam. The time series of cost differences between the dam with power
facilities and the two power plants is the incremental investment in the dam
needed to exploit the Stage II irrigation potential. The capital cost of the
project is expected to be US$49.3 million. The annual operation and maintenance
cost, based on US$31.0/ha for gravity systems and an average of US$73.6/ha for
pump systems, is expected to be US$1.02 million.
7.04      Benefits.  Expected future yields, cropping intensities, and produc-
tion with and without the project are discussed in Chapter 5. Chapter 6
presents the farm-gate prices for inputs and outputs, based on the Bank's
commodity price forecasts for rice and chemical fertilizers. Gross returns,
production costs, net returns (without accounting for labor) and labor require-
ments per ha are given in Annex 2. Table 3.1 shows the proposed cropping
calendar. Table 7.1 summarizes the foregoing information and gives the expected
benefits in the project area at full agricultural development. Table 7.2
shows expected benefits from the dry season cropping of 46,000 ha of Stage I
area which would benefit from the dam.
7.05      Farm Labor.  As a result of the project, the demand for labor would
increase from 2.92 million man-days without the project to 5.06 million man-
days with the project. In order to value the incremental cost of labor, shadow
wage rates were calculated by examining the combined impact of the development
of Stages I and II on the MRMP area. In 1975, there were an estimated 32,000
farm families and 13,400 landless families in the MRMP area. The average
family size is 6.2, from which two full-time workers are available, giving a
total labor supply of 90,800 workers. Assuming an annual growth in labor
force of 4%, (compared to a historical growth in population of 5% in the
project area due to migration,/2 and 2.5% for the country as a whole), the
total labor supply at full development in 1987 would amount to about 145,300
workers. Assuming 20 days of work per month, the total available monthly
labor supply would be 2.9 million man-days in 1987. An examination of the
monthly demand for labor (Annex 2) shows that the peak demands, occuring in
May and October, represent about 98% and 81% of the labor supply respectively.
The average yearly demand would be 58% of the labor supply. There are no
other major agricultural or industrial developments planiied in or near the
project area and it is not likely that a serious labor shortage would develop.
The economic cost of labor at different times of the year was determined by
calculating the marginal opportunity cost of farm labor. This analysis shows
that the average shadow wage rate would be P 2.67/man-day without the
project and P 3.03/man-day with the project, compared to the present peak
season wage rate of P 7.0/man-day. The incremental labor cost due to the
project would be P 7.55 million. Due to dry season cropping of 46,000 ha of
Stage I area, labor demand would increase by 4.6 million man-days annually at
a cost of P 12.5 million.

7.06       Development Period.  Based on the implementation schedule of the
project and that of the Magat high dam, farmers in the project area would
begin growing their crops under improved conditions from 1983 onwards.
Full development yields are expected to be achieved in five years by 1987.
Full development dry season yields in the already developed 46,000 Stage I
area are expected to be achieved in three years by 1985.
7.07       Economic Rate of Return.  Using the foregoing assumptions and
discounting incremental dam and project costs and benefits over a 50-year
evaluation period, the economic rate of return for the project is 13%
(Table 7.3). At a discount rate of 10%, the estimated opportunity cost of
capital in the Philippines, the economic net present value of this investment
in 1978 is US$124.0 million./l
7.08       Sensitivity Analysis.  Sensitivity analysis was used to determine
which variables would be most crucial to the success of the project. In
carrying out the sensitivity analysis, two measures were developed for each
variable tested - the crossover value and the elasticity. The crossover
value is the value of the variable tested for which NPV discounted at 10% is
zero, and is a measure of how far the variable can differ from its most
likely value before the project becomes economically unacceptable. The
crossover value may also be interpreted as the value of the variable tested,
beyond which the economic rate of return would be below 10%. The elasticity
is defined as the percentage change in NPV discounted at 10% with respect to
a 1% change in the variable tested. It is a measure of the rate of change of
NPV change for any change of variable, at the most likely value of that
variable./2.
7.09      The numerical results are presented in Table 7.4, which shows that
the success of the project is most sensitive to future yields for paddy.
The results are also sensitive to future world market prices, which are
beyond the control of the project. The other variables tested would have to
differ widely from their most likely values to affect the viability of the
project.  The probability of these critical variations is discussed below:
(a)  Yields.  The crossover values of yields are about 30% below the
expected project yields at full development. The probability of
future yields falling below the crossover yields is low since many
farmers are already achieving the projected yield levels in the
ADB-assisted Stage IA area only one year after completion of
construction. The possibility of yield slippage has also been
guarded against by the inclusion of the project within the scope of
the Government's plan of action for provision of agricultural
supporting services to Bank-assisted irrigation projects under the
National Irrigation Systems Improvement Project II (Loan 1526-PH).
/1 If the investment in Magat dam is treated as a sunk cost, the economic
rate of return of the project is 19%, giving an economic net present
value in 1978 of US$58.3 million at a 10% discount rate. The rates of
return for the subproject areas range from 17% to 22%.
/2 The elasticity generally changes for movements along the NPV-variable
curve.

- 43 -
(b)  Prices.  The crossover value of rice price is more than 30% below the
Bank's projected price of rice in 1987 and is 7% below the present
price of rice. The Bank's commodity analysts have taken the latest
available information into account in forecasting future rice
prices. On the basis of past experience the probability that the
actual price of rice will exceed the crossover value is
over 95%. The farm-gate price for the economic analysis is
based on the assumption that the Philippines would export rice in
1987. However, if the Philippines does not become self-sufficient by
that time, the economic farm-gate price would be equal to the
import parity price which is about 10% higher. This would increase
the economic rate of return of the project by a percentage point.
(c)  Construction Costs.  Real cost overruns on the entire Stage II
investment would have to be 33% before development of Stage II
irrigation becomes unacceptable. The project consists of standard
irrigation works and a considerable amount of engineering design
has been completed. In addition, the power facilities are standard
and the costs used for the Magat high dam reflect the actual
winning bid. Therefore, a real cost overrun of this magnitude
is improbable.
(d)   Cropping Intensity.  The expected cropping intensity with the
project is based on a 30-year reservoir operation study. It is
unlikely that the cropping intensity would fall by 55% to the
crossover value of less than 140%.
(e)  Construction Period.  The possibility of the dam, power facilities and
the project being completed as much as six years late is low since
NIA has had previous dam construction experience in the case of the
Pantabangan dam, the power facilities are standard, the irrigation
works are uncomplicated and NIA has extensive experience in implement-
ing such works.
(f)  Development Period.  A slow buildup of support services might cause
some delay in attainment of the projected yields, but it is unlikely
that it would take as much as twenty years to achieve the expected
yield levels. The possibility of a delay is further reduced by the
Government's plan of action for support services to irrigation
projects.
(g)  Economic Wage Rate.  The economic rate of return is insensi-
tive to this variable. The crossover economic wage rate is over
six times the expected economic wage rate.
7.10      Risks.  No problems of implementation are anticipated as NIA has
ample experience of projects of similar scope. Failure to reach the antici-
pated yield levels at full development would pose the highest potential
risk to the project. Since farmers in Stage IA are already obtaining the
projected yields and in view of the activism of the Magat ADCC, the likelihood
of a shortfall in expected yield levels sufficient to undermine the success
of the project is small.

Stages I and II
7.11      Investment Costs.  The shadow-priced capital cost of Stage IA,
expressed in end-1978 prices, is US$17.96 million.  This stage was completed
in 1977.  Stage IB, including Stage II study costs, is expected to be
completed by 1980 and is projected to cost US$75.55 million. The total cost
of Stage II, including the Magat dam and power and irrigation components, is
expected to be US$431.38 million. The annual operation and maintenance
costs with the project consist of US$31.0/ha for gravity systems, US$73.6/ha
for pump systems, US$0.55 million for the dam, and US$1.55 million for the
powerhouse. It is estimated that US$62.1 million /1 would have to be spent
on transmission and distribution facilities in order to make the power and
energy available to end consumers. The annual operation and maintenance
cost of these facilities is expected to be US$1.4 million.
7.12      Benefits.  Expected future yields, cropping intensities, production
costs, labor costs, and the economic benefits at full development for Stages
IA, IB, and the cropping due to dry season water availability from the dam
are shown in detail in Annex 2. These calculations use the latest price
projections of the Bank and updated production costs to end-1978 levels.
Benefits from Stage II irrigation are shown in Table 7.1. The aggregated
benefits for irrigation in both Stages are given in Table 7.5 and for power
in Table 7.6.
7.13      Development Period.  Stage IA, completed in 1977, is expected
to reach full development in 1982. Stage IB, to be completed in 1980, is
expected to reach full development in 1985. The Magat dam would be completed
by 1982 and the yields in the Stage I areas receiving dry season water from
the dam are expected to reach full development by 1985. Stage II's full
development yields are expected to be reached in 1987.
7.14      Economic Rate of Return.  Using the foregoing assumptions and dis-
counting the costs and benefits over a 50-year evaluation period, the economic
rate of return for the combined Stages I and II is 13% (Table 7.6). At a
discount rate of 10%, the economic net present value is US$164.84 million.
7.15      Sensitivity Analysis.  The numerical results, presented in Table
7.7, show that the economic success of the project is most sensitive to
future projected yields and the world market price of rice. The crossover
values and sensitivities of the variables tested earlier are more critical
for the combined Stages I and II than for the Stage II irrigation project.
However, earlier comments made regarding these variables are valid for this
analysis. Discussion of some additional variables is provided below.
7.16      Economic Value of Energy.  The crossover value of energy is about half
that used in the appraisal report. Power benefits were expressed in terms of
the price per kWh consumers would be willing to pay. Since it was not possible
to measure willingness to pay directly, the retail tariff was taken as the
/1 Staff Appraisal Report No. 1911-PH, Magat River Multipurpose Project:
Stage II, updated to end-1978.

minimum measure of the consumers' willingness to pay, ignoring consumers'
surplus and the possibility that the market clearing rate might be higher than
the actual tariffs. Therefore, it is impossible that the value of energy is
below the crossover value.
7.17      Dam Construction Period.  The probability that the completion of the
dam would take 10 years instead of 6 years is extremely low.
7.18      Power Station Construction Period.  The probability that construction
of the power station would take 15 years is negligible. The power station civil
works and generating equipment are standard and no manufacturing or installation
problems are expected.

8. AGREEMENTS REACHED AND RECOMMENDATION
8.01.     During negotiations agreement with the Government was reached on
the following principal points:
(a) The amount of civil works carried out by force account would
not exceed 40% of the total cost of civil works excluding those
subject to ICB (para. 3.19); and
(c) NIA would engage consultants satisfactory to the Bank under terms
of reference and conditions agreed with the Bank (para. 4.05).
8.02      The proposed project would be suitable for a Bank loan of
US$21.0 million for a period of 20 years including 5 years of grace. The
borrower would be the Republic of the Philippines.

additional charge of P 23/ha (0.4 cav/ha) in the wet season and P 65/ha (1.1 cav/ha) in the dry season is expected to be levied for pump
systems to cover energy expenses for operating the pumps.
/e  Incomes shown for farm type DB in the future are for farms in the Siffu East No. 1 pump system area.  Due to different energy consumption for pump
systems in Cauayan East and Siffu East No. 2 areas, incomes of farm type DB would be P 170 lower in Cauayan East and P 405 lower in Siffu East
No. 2 for 2.5 ha farms.  These figures would be P 238.0 and P 567.0 for 3.5 ha farms respectively.
/f  Based on amortizing owner with annual payments over 15 years at 6% of unpaid balance; based on price of land at 2.5 times present gross value of
production.                                                                                                                                                               H D
/g  Based on 25% of gross value of production minus seed, harvesting and threshing costs.                                                                                       z
