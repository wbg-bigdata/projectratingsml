REPORT AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT OF THE
INTERNATIONAL BANK FOR RECONSTRUCTION AND DEVELOPMENT
TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS ON A
PROPOSED-LOAN IN Ai AMOUNT EQUIVALENT TO US$31.0 MILLION TO THE
JORDAN PHOSPHATE MINES COMPANY LIMITED WITH THE GUARANTEE OF THE
HASHEMITE KINGDOM OF JORDAN FOR THE SHIDIYA PHOSPHATE MINE PROJECT
1.        The following memorandum and recommendation on a proposed loan to
the Jordan Phosphate Mines Company Limited (JPMC) for US$31.0 million
equivalent is submitted for approval. The proposed loan would be
guaranteed by the Hashemite Kingdom of Jordan and would carry a standard
variable interest rate with a maturity of 17 years, including 4 years of
grace and would help finance the Shidiya Phosphate Mine Project.
2.        Background. Phosphate is Jordan's most important natural
resource and the country's major foreign exchange earner. The Jordan
Phosphate Mines Company has increased exports of phosphate rock from
2.2 mt in 1978 to more than 5.1 mt in 1986 (about 10 percent of present
world trade), taking advantage of a favorable location for the growing
markets of Asia, the Far East and, to a lesser extent, Eastern Europe,
combined with low costs relative to major competitors. Existing mines have
limited reserves. The Shidiya deposit has higher grade rock, good mining
conditions, and over 1 billion tonnes of reserves. Restructuring of the
sector has been initiated by the Government by absorbing the former Jordan
Fertilizer Co. (JFI) into JPMC. The project will support the initial phase
of the Shidiya mine development and would enable Jordan to sustain and
increase its exports.
3.        Rationale for Bank Involvement.  The Bank has had a long-standing
relationship with Jordan on the development of its important mining sector
and has been advising the Government on technical, financial and market
aspects for a number of years. This advice has been accepted by the
Government as evidenced most recently by its substantial downsizing of the
Project. The Bank's continued involvement will provide the Jordanian
Government and JPMC with technical advice and assistance for sector insti-
tution building, and to ensure a proper techno-economic evaluation of the
further second-stage developments at Shidiya and an optimal phasing of such
development in relation to the depletion of existing mines in the
1990's. Bank involvement will help improve JPMC's financial position,
temporarily weakened by the costly absorption of JFI, and thus help attract
potential private sector partners for iPMC. Through the Project, the Bank
would work closely with JPMC to ensure that dust control measures are taken
to reduce phosphate dust pollution at Aqaba port to internationally
accepted environmental standards. Finally, the proposed Project is well in
line with the Bank's lending strategy. It will increase the country's
foreign exchange earnings by about US$45 million per year; it will expand
Jordan's exploitation of natural resources and its industrial sector.
4.        Project Objectives.  The Project's objectives would he to (i)
bring the Shidiya deposit into production at a level of 1.5 mtpy to allow
Jordan to pursue its successful export strategy; (ii) improve efficiency in



-2-
mining and downstream fertilizer production through accelerated research;
(iii) help secure the overall viability of the restructured phosphate
fertilizer sector; and (iv) reduce environmental pollution at Aqaba port
from loading/unloading of phosphate rock.
5.        Proiect Description.  A new mine and beneficiation plant
would be developed at Shidiya, 120 kms north of the port of Aqaba, to
produce 1.5 mtpy of phosphate rock. The project is an important first step
in the development of the large unexploited Shidlya deposit. It comprises
open-pit mine equipment; millsite equipment, including screening plant with
product storage and handling facllities; and associated social and
industrial infrastructure, including townsite development, water and power
supply and distribution, and an access road. The Project's technical
assistance component will help to orient and implement (i) research for
phosphate fines and slimes recovery; and (ii) appropriate beneficiation
research programs to define future mine and beneficiation development
phases at Shidiya to ensure optimal sector configuration. It will also
upgrade corporate planning, financial studies, personnel administration and
lnternal audit functions. The total cost of the project is estimated at
US$89.0 million equivalent, with a foreign exchange component of US$65.6
million. A breakdown of the costs and the financing plan are shown in
Schedule A. Amounts and methods of procurement, disbursements and the
disbursement schedule are shown in Schedule B. A timetable of key project
processing events and the status of Bank Group operations in Jordan are
given in Schedules C and D, respectively. A map is also attached. The
Staff Appraisal Report No. 6932-Jo, dated December 18, 1987, is being
distributed separately.
6.        Actions Agreed on.  Agreement was reached with JPNC during
negotiations that it will:
(a) implement an action plan for completion of JPMC's Managerial
Integration (following absorption of JFI) by December 31,
1988;
(b) Submit annual audited financial statements, together with
the auditor's report, to the Bank within 6 months of the end
of each fiscal year;
(c) progressively reduce phosphate dust pollution at Aqaba to
internationally acceptable standards by December 31, 1990;
(d) prepare and submit an implementation plan for the project
technical assistance component for Bank review by end-FY88
and that hiring of consultants will commence by mid-FY89;
(e) achieve and maintain a working ratio (working expenditures/
current revenues) below 0.8 from FY88 onward, and satisfact-
ory debt service and long-term debt/equity ratios of above
1.5 and below 60/40 respectively in FY88 and thereafter;



-3-
(f) update 5-year investment plans annually in consultation with
the Bank at least 6 months prior to the beginning of the
fiscal year;
(g) seek prior Bank agreement before contracting new long-term
loans in excess of JD 1.5 million; and
(h) raise its capital and special reserve by minimum JD 25
million by end-FY88.
7.        Agreement was reached with the Government during negotiatons that
it will: (a) complete construction of access road to Shidiya by December
31, 1988; (b) cause JEA to complete the construction of the power line and
substation for the Project by December 31, 1988; and (c) subscribe to a new
issue of capital stock in JPMC to increase JPMC's equity to JD 80 million
if the present JPMC capital share offering is not fully subscribed. The
proposed loan will become effective only upon receipt of satisfactory
evidence that JPMC has all necessary rights for use of water and land at
(i) the Shidiya mine site and townsite, and (ii) water wells and water
pipelines.
8.        Benefits.  The project would contribute to increasing Jordan's
foreign exchange earnings and to rationalizing and streamlining the
phosphate industry. Favorable geological/geographical conditions place the
project among the lowest in terms of production and investment cost
worldwide as reflected in the projected FRR and ERR in excess of 35%. The
net balance of payment impact of the Project is about US$850 million over
20 years (average: US$43 million p.a.). In addition, the Project will
generate directly about 750 jobs and at least 150 indirect jobs. The
Project will reduce the environmental pollution at Aqaba due to
loading/unloading of phosphate rock. It will contribute to institutional
improvements in JPMC.
9.        Risks. Given the oversupply of phosphate rock in the world
market, market an9 price risks associated with the Project have been
reviewed in detail and found acceptable. The production increase resulting
from the Project represents less than 1% of world demand, and will not
increase significantly Jordan's phosphate market share. The Project's
production will be absorbed mainly by the growing Asia and Far East
markets, and replace depleting mines in Oceania. Jordan has a significant
cost advantage on these markets, compared to its major competitors.
Sensitivity analyses have demonstrated that the company and the Project can
sustain substantially lower price and market prospects and remain
financially viable. The project faces no higher technical risks than those
normally associated with open-pit mining. All project activities involve
proven technology that has been in regular use in the industrialized world
and in Jordan. JPMC has considerable experience with the implementation of
similar open-pit mines in Jordan and has developed sound project management
techniques and tools.

10.       R.couendation.  I am sstisfled that the proposed loan would
comply with the Articles of Agreement of the Bank and recomend that the
Executive Directovs approve it.
