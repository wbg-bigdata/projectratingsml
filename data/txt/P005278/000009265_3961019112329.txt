SHIDIYA PHOSPHATE MINE PROJECT (LOAN 2902-JO)
Preface
This is the Implementation Completion Report (ICR) for the Shidiya
Phosphate Mine Project in Jordan, for which Loan 2902-JO in the amount of US$31
million was approved on January 19, 1988, and made effective on April 25, 1988.
The loan was closed on October 31, 1994, following an extension of
4 months to the original loan closing date of June 30, 1994. Final disbursement
took place on December 22, 1994.
The ICR was prepared by Mr. Christopher Wardell, Industry and Mining
Division, Industry and Energy Department, Vice Presidency for Finance and Private
Sector Development and reviewed by Mr. Alastair McKechnie, Chief, Private Sector
Development and Infrastructure Division, Country Department II, Middle East and
North Africa Region and by Mr. Gianni Brizzi, Project Advisor, Country Department
1I. The Borrower provided comments that are included an an Appendix to the ICR.
Preparation of this ICR was begun during the Bank's final supervision
mission in June 1994. It is based on material in the project file. The Borrower
contributed to the preparation of the ICR by frankly exchanging views on the
project preparation, procurement, implementation and initial operations'
experiences and related issues, by commenting on the draft ICR and by preparing
its own evaluation of the project's preparation and execution.

SHIDIYA PHOSPHATE MINE PROJECT (LOAN 2902-JO)
Executive Sumnary
Introduction
During the 19700 and early-1980s, Bank assistance to Jordan was
designed to support national development plans aimed at restructuring the economy
to achieve a wider manufacturing base, to reduce dependency on external grants,
and to spread development among different regions. Particularly, Bank assistance
was developed to diversify the country's economic base, to promote exports, and
to alleviate manpower and infrastructure constraints in the productive sector,
and encourage a more balanced growth among regions. In the industrial sector,
Bank assistance was directed at a better utilization of domestic resources and
manpower skills, toward the establishment of a broader export-oriented industrial
base. Bank involvement in the industrial sector had consisted of an Emergency
Credit (1975) in the potash sector, potash projects (1978, 1986), an Energy
Development Project (1983) and several power projects. IFC investment had been
in the production of ceramic tiles, aluminum fluoride, phosphate fertilizers,
bricks, and the development of the Amman Capital Market.
Proiect Obiectives
(a)         The primary project objective was to increase Jordan's phosphate rock
production by 1.5 million tonnes per year, thus increasing the country's total
rock exports to a level in excess of 7 million tonnes per year. other objectives
included (i) ensuring that the production from the new project site would be
inter-phased effectively with existing and declining phosphate rock production
at traditional mines; (ii) reorganizing and restructuring the phosphate sector
by the methodical integration of traditional mining operations with downstream
fertilizer  facilities;   (iii)  investigating  and  remedying  environmental
degradation at phosphate loading operations at Aqaba; and (iv) optimizing the
design of downstream phosphate beneficiation plant facilities planned as a second
stage Shidiya development (Section A).
(b)         Although loan covenants were not designed specifically to promote the
achievement of all the project objectives, a supplementary (side) letter to the
loan agreement outlining dated agreements regarding environmental measures to be
adopted, provided a framework to ensure that phosphate dust emissions at the port
of Aqaba were brought quickly to international standards. In addition, covenants
in the Guarantee Agreement ensured effectively that project infrastructure was
completed in a timely manner.
(c)         Sector and institutional development, physical, and environmental
project objectives were broad, clear and precise, and provided an excellent
framework for successful project development and implementation (Section B). The
project design and its implementation were neither complex, nor particularly
demanding for the Borrower. Risks attendant with projects involved in commodity
exports facing cyclical trends were encountered. Borrower circumstances changed



- ii -
in the latter stages of project implementation due to a serious decline in world
phosphate rock markets.  As a result, the Borrower had to scale back project
production build-up and mine development priorities in the context of planned
inter-phasing of Shidiya development with the output of traditional mines.
IuwvlementatLon Exrerience and Results
(a)         Notwithstanding significant project delays, the project can be
defined as a success since it achieved the major part of its objectives. Sector
policy improvements have been effected (para. 8); physical objectives, within the
constraint of tight market conditions that have developed during project
implementation, will be met within the next 12-15 months (para. 9); substantial
institutional development of the Borrower's enterprise have been effected (para.
11); phosphate mining and phosphate loading for export are now undertaken to
international environmental standards (para. 12); and the financial and economic
benefits, even under an onerous fiscal regime imposed by government during
project implementation, are substantial (para. 13). Project sustainability is
likely, bearing in mind the Borrower's long experience in operating similar
operations with comparable technology (para. 18).
(b)         The project  has been  completed at  a cost  of US$76.9  million
equivalent, compared with the forecast cost of USS87.1 million equivalent (Part
III, Table 7A). The cost savings result from the highly competitive bids for
mining equipment under international competitive bidding and the resultant lack
of need to utilize estimated price and physical contingencies.   Financing
arrangements were essentially as planned (Part III, Table 7B), with the Borrower
covering most of the project costs not funded by the Bank loan. However, the
Borrower took advantage of certain concessional loans: (i) a US$11.0 million
equivalent loan was mobilized from the Islamic Development Bank (US$2.0 were
utilized directly for the project) and (ii) supplier/export credits totalling
US$8.5 million equivalent were obtained and used to support Borrower's internal
cash generation. The project construction was completed with the commissioning
of the second dragline  in October 1991.   This compares with the planned
construction completion date of end-1989.
(C)         Three key factors affected the achievement of the project's main
objective of increasing the production and export of phosphate rock from Jordan
(para. 16).  Firstly, initial procurement had to be repeated after the non-
responsiveness of initial bids received for draglines and for dump trucks.
Secondly, the crisis in the Gulf in 1991 delayed erection of draglines and also
the import of spare parts for mining equipment and the export of phosphate rock.
Thirdly, serious market constraints occurred, starting in 1992, causing the
Borrower to scale back the project production build-up and reduce Jordan's level
of exports.   Phosphate  ore stocks  nonetheless  accumulated  in 1992-93  to
unacceptable levels and the Borrower was obliged to focus on reduction of these
stocks to manageable levels, largely at the expense of production. In addition,
the quantity of overburden created from the rnitial mining cut and which had to
be rehandled by the draglines was under-estimated at appraisal. This reduced the
capacity of main mining equipment to expose sufficient phosphate rock to meet the
planned production schedule. The performance of main mining equipment also did
not reach levels warranted by suppliers. Due to the delays associated with these
factors, the quantity of lower quality Shidiya ore beds released from the initial



- iii -
mine development exceeded forecasts and with the delay of construction of
beneficiation plant facilities (under Loan 3172-JO) to process this lower quality
ore, led to the Borrower slowing the initial mine development production build-up
(para. 17).
(d)         In general,  the performance of the Bank, the Borrower and the
government  as  Guarantor,   was  highly  satisfactory  throughout  project
implementation (Sections E and F). The Borrower prepared a bankable feasibility
study; handled procurement efficiently; and constructed the project in a
commercial  and well organized manner.   The Guarantor arranged the timely
provision of project infrastructure and ensured that a necessary share issue to
increase the Borrower's capital base was fully subscribed. Bank staff assisted
in defining a project scope that was within the financing capability of the
country and that secured early project output and revenues. Bank and Borrower
staff participated in a major development impact assessment.   Although this
occurred towards the end of project implementation, it proved critical to focus
on key project issue. and the adjustment of corporate strategie. for the Borrower
during serious market difficulties. The main weakness of the Bank was in its
optimistic forecast of world market growth for phosphate rock exports and in
developing spare parts (working capital) management arrangements that were
unworkable as defined originally in the loan agreement. The main weakness of the
Borrower was its failure to (i) transfer the most experienced operating personnel
from existing mines to the new project site; and (ii) adjust quickly its
corporate strategies during the latter stages of project implementation, in the
light of declining market conditions.
(e)         On the basis that the major project objectives have been met and that
the physical objective of developing an early mine production scheme at Shidiya
is reachable in the near-term, the project outcome is rated as satisfactory. In
addition, it provides a sound basis for ensuring the success of the subsequent
Integrated Phosphate Project (Loan 3172-JO).
Summary of Findings. Future Operations, and Key Lessons Learned
(a)         The Borrower's overall production plan  is now focused on the
development of the low unit production cost Shidiya mine area and its orderly
inter-phasing with traditional mine areas. Production build-up is continuing to
strengthen and the target output is planned to be achieved in 1996, in phase with
the start-up of beneficiation plant facilities under Loan 3172-JO. On the basis
of the Borrower's long experience in the operation of phosphate mines utilizing
similar technology, the recent change of senior management, and the commitment
of operations and maintenance staff to the mine site at Shidiya, the project
output is reachable and should pose no problem in terms of sustainability
(Section H).
(b)         There are two key findings/lessons to be learned from the project
implementation experience (Section I). Firstly, with a simple project design and
a strong commercially oriented enterprise, substantial project benefits can be
attained in terms of sector and institutional development, physical output, and
environmental and financial/economic impact.   Secondly,  for any enterprise
involved in commodity exports subject to cyclical trends, market growth prospects
must be addressed with caution and sensitivity analyses undertaken to ensure



- iv -
project viability and *ustainability. In addition, the enterprise management
must remain flexible and be able to adjust quickly its corporate strategies to
survive serious market fluctuations and down turns. In this case, however, the
major economic dislocations that occurred in eastern Europe in the early-1990's
that affected seriously phosphate world demand could not be anticipated in any
meaningful way in sensitivity analyses.
(C)         Following the Borrower's successful upgrading of its corporate and
production planning, financial analysis skills and overall corporate financial
management, Jordan's phosphate sector operations management should continue to
make a major contribution to the country's economy. Together with the corporate
upgrading the project should place the Borrower in a strong and predictable
financial position, such that, with adequate guidance, private sector interests
could now be encouraged to assist and actively participate in future industry
expansion.



IMPLEMENTATION COMPLETION REPORT
JORDAN
SHIDIYA PHOSPHATE MINE PROJECT (LOAN 2902-JOb
Part I - Project Implementation Asses me nt
A.    Proiect Ob ectives
1.          Recognizing that phosphate is the most important of Jordan's mineral
resources and provides substantial foreign exchange earnings (through the export
of phosphate rock and phosphate fertilizers) and thus a substantial contribution
to gross domestic product, the primary project objectives were (a) to increase
phosphate rock production and the level of phosphate rock exports and (b) to
open-up the first stage of the newly discovered Shidiya phosphate area.
2.          Phosphate rock had traditionally been mined at the Zl Hansa and Z1
Abiad mines.   However, these mines were faced with  limited economically
recoverable phosphate rock reserves and were becoming increasingly high cost,
thus reducing potentially the international competitiveness of Jordan's exports.
Exploration campaigns at Shidiya had identified extensive reserves of phosphate
rock of relatively high quality and over a continuous area, as opposed to
existing mines with rock only occurring in isolated lenticular and thus separate
ore bodies. Pre-feasibility assessment had indicated that mine development at
Shidiya could be undertaken at lower unit production cost, thus reducing Jordan's
overall production costs and increasing its international competitiveness. The
project recognized the need for an orderly inter-phasing of declining output from
the existing mines with the start-up of Shidiya operatlons. Thus the primary
project objectives were both clear and realistic.
3.          Initlal  pre-feasibility  study  assessments  had  focused  on  the
development of a 10 million tonnes per year Shidiya mine operation as an
integrated mine-beneficiation plant-rail-fertilizer plant development.   The
subsequent project redesign as an early mine production scheme (1.5 million
tonnes phosphate rock per year), to be followed by the development of phosphate
beneflclation plant facilities at Shidiya to produce an additional 1.5 million
tonnes phosphate rock concentrates per year from the benefiLiation of lower
quality rock from the initial mining area, brought the project scope within the
financing capabilities of the country, thus facilltating the generation of early
phosphate rock production and revenues from the Shidiya deposit.
4.          Serious environmental issues existed at the port of Aqaba where
phosphate rock was loaded onto ships for export.  The project objective of
providlng technlcal assistance to evaluate options to do-dust phosphate rock
products at the various mlne sites in Jordan and to investigate the nature of and
remedy the environmental degradation at the ship loading facilities at Aqaba was
well conceived. In addltion, the Lnvestigation of the utilizatlon of phosphate
fines in the fertilizer plant facilities at Aqaba was designed to enhance the
economics of the overall phosphate industry in Jordan.



- 2 -
5           The implementing agency (the Borrower) for the project was the Jordan
Phosphate Mines Company (JPMC) Limited. With long experience in the development,
construction and operation of phosphate mines in Jordan, utilizing similar
technology, the project was well within the Borrower's capabilities.   The
project's institutional objective was to assist the Borrower to reorganize and
restructure the phosphate sector by the methodical integration of JPMC's
traditional phosphate mine operations with downstream fertilizer plant
operations, formerly managed by the Jordan Fertilizer Industries  (JFI).  A
related objective was to restore the private sector's confidence in JPMC in
anticipation of its participation in future expansion phases. This was necessary
mince the financial impact of the integration of JFI's fertilizer complex had
placed the company in a tight cash position and with reduced profitability.  The
project also included provision for technical assistance to help optimize the
design of beneficiation plant facilities at Shidiya to process lower grade
phosphate rock to be mined in addition to the direct export rock.
6.          The project faced no technical risks beyond those associated with any
open-pit mine development.  On the basis of JPMC's long experience in mine
development in Jordan, these risks were recognized as minimal. Main risks were
foreseen in phosphate market development forecasts and prices.  Sensitivity
analyses demonstrated that under worst foreseen assumptions, the project was not
exposed to serious risks in these areas.
7.          Borrower circumstances changed dramatically in 1992 with a marked
deterioration in market conditions for the export of phosphate rock. Eastern
Europe markets virtually collapsed, particularly in Romania and Poland (due to
serious internal economic difficulties and limited foreign exchange to procure
imports), and in Yugoslavia (due to internal conflicts).   In India, one of
Jordan's key markets for phosphate rock exports, market penetration was
aggravated by (i) the removal of India government subsidies to farmers, and (ii)
liberalization by the Indian government of procurement of phosphate fertilizer
raw materials imports for both public and private enterprises, responsibility for
which had previously rested on a monopoly basis with the Indian Minerals and
Metals Trading Corporation (MMTC). Lack of adjustment of corporate strategies
to these deteriorating market conditions led to serious Borrower financial
results in 1993 and a need to cut back quickly rock production to draw down
excessive levels of stocks.   As a result, Jordan's overall phosphate rock
production (including the project development) had to be pared back and the level
of phosphate rock exports declined.
B.    Achievement of Proiect Obiectives
8.          Sector Policy Improvements    The Shidiya Mine Project was not
designed specifically to address policy issues. However, important sector policy
matters were addressed. The mining and fertilizer operations of the phosphate
industry in Jordan were fully integrated and the management, planning, budgeting
and accounting of the new company's (mine and fertilizer) operations were
rationalized. By the time of loan closing, the Borrower had committed itself to
implement a program to upgrade production planning and financial management and
to focus production on a cost-driven (as opposed to an export/production-driven)
basis and to focus production on the lower unit cost Shidiya mine area.
Phosphate fines are now collected at mines during de-dusting and are utilized at



the fertilizer complex with sub-commercial phosphate rock grades as an integral
part of the fertilizer plant feed, thus enhancing the overall economics of the
sector. During the project implementation, JPMC developed private sector joint
venture contracts for the construction of downstream intermediate and final
phosphate fertilizer products in Jordan, providing not only a captive supply for
a portion of phosphate rock production but further diversifying its product lines
and thus its ability to adjust to phosphate market demand variations.
9.          Physical Obiectives. The project was designed to produce 1.5 million
tonnes of direct export ore from the high quality A2 phosphate bed at Shidiya,
by 1989. Production in 1994 reached almost 1.0 million tonnes and is scheduled
to reach 1.4 million tonnes in 1995, with target production being attained in
1996, to phase with the completion of beneficiation plant facilities under Loan
3172-JO.  The delayed production build-up is due, inter alia, to (i) initial
procurement delays; (ii) the crisis in the Gulf in 1991; (iii) excessive levels
of overburden from the initial mine opening cut that have had to be rehandled;
(iv) tighter than anticipated world phosphate rock market conditions; and (v)
levels of stocks of the lower quality Al and A3 ores that has accumulated due to
delays in starting construction of the Shidiya beneficiation plant. Construction
of the beneficiation plant under Loan 3172-JO is now advancing as per the revised
project schedule and will be commissioned at end-1995, at which time, Shidiya
mine output should reach its target production. Although this will represent a
delay of the attainment of the key project objective, the reduced project costs
have translated into strong project benefits (para. 13).
10.         Although the objective of increasing production at Shidiya to 1.5
million tons will be achieved, the objective of expanding the export of Jordan's
phosphate rock has not been achieved. Due to the collapse of the economies of
key east European importing countries and more onerous conditions for the import
of rock in India, world phosphate trade deteriorated substantially in the early
1990s.   Jordan's phosphate rock exports, forecast at appraisal to increase
progressively to 8.0 million tonnes by 1994, declined actually from the 1986
level of 5.3 million tonnes to only 3.8 million tonnes in 1994 and are not
expected to exceed 4.0 million tonnes in 1995. Nevertheless, through aggressive
marketing strategies, JPMC has maintained its world market share of approximately
14 per cent.
11.         Institutional Development.   Substantial development of JPMC has
occurred during the project preparation, appraisal and implementation phases.
At the time of project preparation, the government had reached agreement with
JPMC management that the company would assume responsibility for the state-owned
Jordan Fertilizer Industries (JFI), operator of a di-ammonium phosphate
(DAP)/phosphoric acid plant at Aqaba. JFI had failed to reach its target project
(output) objective and faced financial distress. In taking over responsibility
for this fertilizer operation, JPMC management saw the benefit of (i)
consolidating the mining and processing phosphate industry operations in Jordan,
(ii) increasing the vertical integration of Jordan's phosphate mine and
fertilizer industries, and (iii) developing a more diverse market product spread.
However, JPMC also recognized that institutional restructuring would be
important.  It recognized that although there would be benefit in production
(mines and fertilizer) units maintaining operational and managerial autonomy,
functional units would require enhanced integration. Although the integration



of technical, marketing and finance functions was advanced at the time of
appraisal, agreement was reached that administration, internal audit, cost and
financial accounting systems, financial studies and budgeting, and corporate
planning would be upgraded to improve corporate cost effectiveness. The last
phase of technical assistance (production planning and financial management) has
completed effectively the overall corporate restructuring plans, JPMC is now
committed to further upgrade its corporate planning/financial management and is
thus well placed to conduct its affairs in a controlled commercial manner and to
maintain its international competitiveness.
12.         Znvironmental Imnrovement .  No serious environmental issues were
foreseen at the mine site and none have developed.   The key issue addressed
during appraisal and loan negotiations related to the phosphate dust emissions
during ship loading of phosphate rock at Aqaba. Phosphate dust emissions had
been associated traditionally with (i) rail and truck movements and unloading at
the port site, (ii) conveyor transfer to ship berth areas, and (iii) ship
loading. JPMC committed themselves to the procurement of local consultants who
developed monitoring stations and measured deposition in the town of Aqaba, at
the port site and in the general environs of the port. As a result of this study
program, it was established that the major environmental issue at and around
Aqaba was generated by dust blown from the adjacent desert areas. Background
dust levels were such that monitoring stations were unable to measure any
quantity of phosphate particles. Nevertheless, JPMC accepted that dust emissions
during ship loading were measurable and committed itself to (i) a program of de-
dusting phosphate rock at the inland mine sites to mitigate phosphate fines
arriving at the port; (ii) successful testing of the utilization of phosphate
fines at the fertilizer complex and their transportation to that plant; (iii) the
installation of dust collection devices at unloading points within the port
complex; and (iv) the procurement and installation of choke feeders to control
duct emissions during ship loading. In addition, general housekeeping at the
port site (road cleaning etc.) was substantially upgraded. The quantities of
fugitive dust now generated by JPMC operations at Aqaba having been essentially
eliminated.   Nevertheless, through ongoing discussions with the Aqaba Port
Corporation (TPC), further improvements in housekeeping, focusing on additional
fine tuning of phosphate unloading areas and conveyor transfer towers is planned.
This will bring the environmental position of the phosphate loading at Aqaba port
into a world class statas.
13.         Financial Objectives.  Significant financial and economic benefits
from the project were estimated at project appraisal, confirmed during a
development impact assessment (mid-term review) and reconfirmed at loan closing.
Although the economic benefits are lower than originally forecast, they are
nevertheless, highly positive (Part II, Table 8). The economic rate of return,
now recalculated at 20 per cent (as compared to the originally forecast 37 per
cent) underscores the beneficial impact of the project on the Jordanian economy.
The rate of return has been reduced due to delayed revenue (production build-up)
development brought about primarily by (i) initial procurement difficulties; (ii)
the impact of the crisis in the Gulf; and (iii) depressed world phosphate rock
markets. The financial rate of return, now forecast at 10 per cent, confirms
that the project will contribute to the future financial health and stability of
JPMC and to the future competitiveness of the Jordan phosphate industry (through
a reduction in overall JPMC production costs) and can be considered, therefore,



as satisfactory. The financial rate of return has been impacted significantly
by the government imposition, during project implementation, of a JD5.0 (US$7.1)
per tonne production tax (the financial rate of return without the production tax
iu octimated at 16 percent which can be compared to the originally forecast 36
per cent).  This tax is essentially a windfall profits tax, representing an
opportunity taken by the government to draw down a portion of JPMC profits to
fund development in other sectors of the economy. In the short-term, such a tax
may be considered to be in the overall interest of the country; however, in the
medium term, this fiscal taxation environment (which by international mining
standards is onerous) would deter potential private interest in JPMC.   In
addition, such a fiscal environment detracts from JPMC's ability to maintain
financial stability (as evidene d by the new share issue that had to be
subscribed by the government in 1993) and weakens the company's ability to retain
cash generation to fund future investments/expansion. Financial benefits are also
affected by government imposition of (i) axle-load charges on phosphate truck
traffic to Aqaba port (a road maintenance cost recovery mechanism); and (ii)
incroaxcd port fees.
14.         public 8etor Managment.  JPMC is an excellent example of a public
sector enterprise operating on a commercial basis and able to implement a project
in a highly successful manner.   JPMC Projects Department staff produced a
bankable feasibility study; handled international procurement in an expeditious
manner; and organized project construction with a high level of coordination and
ffriciency. The project has placed JPMC in a potential financial position where
private interests would find the company more attractive, subject only to
government recreating a favorable fiscal and regulatory environment that matches
that of the mining industries of other countries.
C.    IDli_ ntation Record and Kaior Factors Affeftinw the Proiset
15.         Based on the near achievement of sector policy, institutional,
physical and financial objectives, the project can be considered as a substantial
success. The implementation record of the project is satisfactory, albeit that
(i) initial procurement difficulties were faced; (ii) the crisis in the Gulf
interfered with expeditious equipment erection and commissioning, and spare parts
procurement; (iii) production build-up was slower than planned; and (iv) target
mine production has yet to be attained.
16.         Factors not Subiect to the Borrower' Control. Procurement (ICB) was
marred by the initial non-responsiveness of bidders for main mining euipment.
Following re-bidding, contracts were finalized successfully but the 6-month
project implementation delay incurred could not be recovered. The crisis in the
Gulf immediately prior to the completion of erection of the main mining equipment
caused an additional 9-month delay. The performance of main mining equipment did
not reach levels warranted by suppliers.  Difficulty in spare parts procurement
for trucks was experienced following the Gulf crisis. Production build-up to the
target output of 1.5 million tonnes A2 ore year has been slower than planned.
Initially this was due to procurement difficulties and the crisis in the Gulf.
However, the key factor affecting production build-up has been deterioration in
world phosphate demand, which still constrains the Borrower's export levels
(including the export of A2 ore from Shidiya).



- 6 -
17.         Factors Subiect to the Borrower's Control. Dragline performance has
yet to reach level, forecast at appraisal, primarily due to incomplete
calculations by both Bank and Borrower staff at appraisal regarding the quantity
of overburden to be rehandled from the initial box-cut. Procurement processing
of turnkey contracts under Loan 3172-Jo, non-responsiveness of turnkey contract
bids received and the advent of the crisis in the Gulf, have caused delay in the
construction of bensficiation plant facilities to process the lower quality (Al
and A3) ore, with the consequence that excessive stockpiles are developing. This
fact, together with the overall market constraints (outside of the Borrower's
control), led to the Borrower's focus on reduction of excessive levels of
phosphate stocks to a manageable level and a resultant slow down in Jordan's
overall phosphate rock production and Shidiya mine development.
D.    Proiect Sustainabilitv
18.         Bearing in mind the long and successful track record of the Borrower
in developing and operating phosphate mines based on similar dragline and mobile
mining equipment technology, the probability that the project will reach and
maintain its major objective of producing 1.5 million tonnes direct export ore
per year from the new and low cost Shidiya mine area, is high. It is now planned
that the project's physical objective will be reached at end-1995, when the
beneficiation plant (being constructed under Loan 3172-JO) is scheduled to be
completed.   From that date, the project is considered likely to be fully
sustainable.  Although project delays have occurred and project benefits are
lower than forecast at project appraisal, realized project costs are lower than
planned and benefits are highly positive (para. 12).
R.    Bank Performance
19.         The performance of the Bank can be considered highly satisfactory.
During project preparation, Bank staff assisted the government to re-define the
project scope, reducing it from a complex, high cost integrated mine-fertilizer
plant-rail configuration to a simple early production mine scheme that permitted
the early development of the potentially lower unit production cost Shidiya mine
area, within the financing capabilities of the country. This reconfiguration of
project design led to an extensive (4 years) project preparation (identification
to appraisal) cycle and to the subsequent formulation of a follow-up operation
(Integrated Phosphate Project - Loan 3172-JO) to complete the first phase Shidiya
mine development. During successive supervision missions, Bank staff assisted
the Borrower to maintain focus not only on project implementation issues but also
on overall corporate development objectives and strategies.
20.         A key contribution of the Bank was an interim assessment of the
development impact of the project. Although undertaken toward completion of the
project, this assessment was invaluable in reassessing the likely benefits that
would result from project implementation and actions necessary to ensure that
benefits  were  maximized.    The  assessment  was  undertaken  (June  1993)
coincidentally at a time when the Borrower, and other world phosphate producers,
were facing serious marketing constraints and facilitated the Borrower's focus
on the urgent need to adjust quickly its corporate strategies, production
planning and overall financial management to optimize the integration of Shidiya



with traditional mines output consistent with maximizing cash flow, liquidity and
profitability.
21.         The main weakness of the Bank's performance was its forecast of world
phosphate market demand. At appraisal, Jordan's rock export levels were forecast
to rise progressively to a level of 8.0 million tonnes by 1994. Actually, Jordan
exports in 1994 are likely to reach only 4.0 million tonnes, reflecting primarily
the collapse of Eastern European economies and the ability of those countries to
finance phosphate (and other) imports and the withdrawal of subsidies to farmere
and the dissolution of the central fertilizer procurement agency in India.
Although these economic changes could not have been foreseen easily at the time
of appraisal, more realistic sensitivity analyses could have helped the Borrower
focus better on the importance of production planning, and to anticipate and
prepare better for the financial stress that resulted in 1993 from a delayed
corporate adjustment to deteriorating market conditions.
22.         Although the need for the Borrower to focus on materials (spare
parts) management was recognized during project appraisal, the loan agreement
covenant developed was impractical  and ill-conceived.   Subsequently,  this
covenant was redefined and effective assistance provided to JPMC to recruit
international specialists to upgrade spare parts (working capital) management.
P.    Borrower Performance
23.         The performance of the Borrower (JPMC - the project implementing
agency) in preparing, implementing and operating the project has been highly
satisfactory. The Shidiya project feasibility study prepared by the Borrower was
of an international and bankable standard and greatly facilitated the Bank's
appraisal of the project. Project procurement was handled efficiently. Mine
infrastructure was developed progressively and ahead of schedule. The Borrower
utilized effectively equipment from existing mines to open up the initial mine
cut in a timely and well organized manner. The government (as Guarantor) ensured
that a mine access road and power lines were completed on schedule and that the
issue of share capital was fully subscribed, supporting international (Kuwait)
participation. In particular, the government, although the principal shareholder
in JPMC, continued a hands-off approach, leaving the company management to
conduct its affairs in its traditional and commercially successful manner.
24.         The Borrower and Guarantor participated in the Bank's development
impact assessment with enthusiasm and commitment, agreeing with the estimate of
lower, through satisfactory, economic and financial rates of return and in the
need to adjust corporate strategies to weakened world market demand and to focus
better overall production planning and financial management. In the depressed
world phosphate market that developed during project implementation, the Borrower
made excellent and successful attempts to develop a market for Shidiya phosphate
ore. Although the Borrower continues to be faced with tight world phosphate
market conditions, technical assistance was retained successfully to assist in
upgrading production planning and overall corporate financial management to
optimize the inter-phasing of Shidiya with existing mines with declining reserves
and to develop a fully cost-driven planning model.



25.         The main weakness of the Borrower was in not transferring fully-
experienced key management, operations and maintenance personnel from its
existing mines to the start-up (initial operations) of the Shidiya development.
This led to somewhat of a lack of focus on the importance of quick production
build-up and equipment availability and utilization that was corrected only in
the later stages of implementation.  In addition, important upgrading of the
company's corporate and production planning, and the development of financial
analysis skills and improved corporate financial management, was achieved only
in the later stages of the project cycle.
26.         In relation to loan covenants, the Borrower and Guarantor were in
general compliance throughout project implementation. In the later stages of the
project implementation, the Guarantor introduced an onerous fiscal regime for the
phosphate industry encompassing a phosphate production tax, truck axle-load
charges and increased phosphate port fees to be paid by the Borrower.  Theme
factors, together with the Borrower's failure to adjust corporate strategies to
deteriorating world market conditions, led to the Borrower's failure in 1993 and
1994 to maintain a financial working ratio as covenanted. New JPMC management
has adjusted now its corporate strategies and is upgrading its overall corporate
and production planning, and financial management functions. The Borrower should
not face difficulty in complying with all financial covenants in future years.
This position will be monitored during ongoing supervision of the Integrated
Phosphate Project under Loan 3172-JO.
3.    Assessment of Outcome
27.         On the basis that major project objectives have been met and the
physical objective of 1.5 million tonnes phosphate rock is considered reachable
and sustainable, the project outcome is rated as satisfactory.   Since the
completion of project construction and the start of initial mine operations,
Shidiya mine production has progressively increased. Although the production
(1.0 million tonnes) of A2 direct export ore in 1994 is below the target
production of 1.5 million tonnes per year, over 90 per cent of target production
is planned and realizable in 1995. The outcome of the project is thus considered
satisfactory, bearing in mind (i) the likely attainment of target production in
1996; (ii) the presently depressed world phosphate markets; and (iii) the delays
in construction of the Shidiya beneficiation plant (under Loan 3172-JO). The
Borrower's production planning and overall corporate financial management are
being upgraded and the Borrower is poised now to return to its earlier years of
sound financial health and security and to make a continued strong contribution
to the country's economy and foreign exchange earnings.
H.    Future Overation
28.         The Borrower's overall corporate plan is focused now on the lower
unit production cost Shidiya mine operation and its orderly inter-phasing with
existing mines.   The Borrower's Shidiya operations plan foresees A2 ore
production reaching the target level in 1996, in phase with the completion and
start-up of the Shidiya beneficiation plant (under Loan 3172-JO) to process lower
quality Shidiya ore.  The Borrower's Production Department and Shidiya mine
management personnel are focused in a way that will likely assure the success of
the future operation of the Shidiya area.



-9-
29.         The key indicators for monitoring and evaluating the future operation
of the Shidiya Mine project, although not identified during the project appraisal
or during loan negotiations, include the rate of recovery of world phosphate rock
markets, and the performance (availability/utilization, and output per unit time)
of the dragline and truck/shovel mining systems.   Bank follow-up will be an
integral part of the supervision of the ongoing Integrated Phosphate project
(under Loan 3172-JO), scheduled for loan closure on December 31, 1995. A project
impact evaluation by the Operations Evaluation Department is not recommended as
a priority.
I.    Kev Lessons Learned
30.         The most significant positive lesson learned from the implementation
'of the project is that with a simple project design, substantial project benefits
(physical, institutional, environmental, and financial) can be realized by an
enterprise such as JPMC, run on commercial lines, and with a committed management
team, well organized project staff to handle procurement and construction,
experienced operations staff to manage initial operations, and support from
government and other shareholders.
31.         The key negative lesson to be learned is that enterprises involved
in the export of commodities (such as phosphate rock) that are subject to
cyclical trends, are subject to variable demand patterns as well as to economic
and political changes in importing countries.   In developing market growth
forecasts against such uncertainties, great care needs to be exercised in base
case analysis, and sensitivity analyses are of critical importance. In addition,
overall corporate management of such an enterprise must be flexible enough so
'that corporate strategies and financial management can be adjusted quickly to
ride out serious market fluctuations.

IMPLEMENTATION COMPLETION REPORT
ESHIDIYA PHOSPHATE MINES PROJECT (LOAN 2902-JO)
EARLY PRODUCTION SCHEME
FEBRUARY 15, 1995
INTRODUCTION
The project is an important first step in the development of
the large unexploited Eshidiya Phosphate deposit estimated at 1.2
Billion BCM. The project was planned to increase Jordan's Phos-
phate Rock production by 1.5 MTPY from the rich A2 Layer, and to
provide a foundation for future phases of development to reach 10
MTPY at the turn of the century, when all other existing phos-
phate mine in Jordan are expected to reach the end of their
physical/economic life. The full loan amount of USS 31 million
has been utilized for foreign procurement of: (i) 2 Electric
walking draglines of 21 mr bucket capacity;  (ii) 22  rear  dumps
trucks of 50t capacity (iii) different mine and millsite mobile
vehicles and support equipment. (iv) Technical assistance includ-
ing (a) beneficiation flotation technology (b) spare parts and
working capital management (c) accounting, finance and corporate
planning (d) dust monitoring at Aqaba Port.
A.   Project Objectives:
___________________
The basic objectives of the project can be summarized as
follows:
1.   To  increase  the  production  of  the company from the
marketable high grade rock phosphate (A2 Layer) by 1.5
MTPY.
2.   To  maximize cost reduction by exploiting Eshidiya ore,
which offers greater advantages in mining, quality,
processing and transport to Aqaba as compared with the
existing mines.
3.   To  provide  a  foundation  for  future  expansions  at
Eshidiya area.
4.   To compensate for the progressive depletion of the most
economically recoverable orebodies at El-Abiyad & El-
Hassa.
5.   To utilize the  superior  characteristics  of  Eshidiya
Ore, in respect to its very low content of heavy met-
1



als, and phosphate fines, to penetrate into new markets
in Europe, Australia, and Newzeland.
6.   To minimize environmental impact of  the  various  com-
ponents of the project by improving on the already
adopted provisions to reduce dust emission at mine
sites as well as at Phosphate export port at Aqaba.
B.   Achievement of Project Objectives:
________________________________
1.   Sector policy improvements:
__________________________
The sector policy at the time the Early Production
Scheme Feasibility Study was prepared (end of 1987),
was limited to : (i) Establishing a foundation for the
exploitation of Eshidiya large resources; (ii) expand-
ing the production thereafter from Eshidiya not only,
to compensate for the loss of production from El-Hassa
and El-Abiyad but also to reach a total production
level of 9 MTPY in 1994, out of which 8 MTPY will be
targeted for export and 1 MTPY for domestic consumption
at the Fertilizer plant at Aqaba; and (iii) To maintain
a production level of 9-10 MTPY starting 1994 through
the year 2002.
The above sectorial policy which has relied on the as-
sumption that the international market demand is ex-
panding at a rate of (3.5% p.a) was to be modified
during the implementation of the project, to readjust
for the drastic changes which took place in the world
market demand and local policies such as:
(i) The purchase of Fertilizer Unit in 1986; (ii) the
collapse of the Eastern Block markets during 1989/1990;
(iii) the restructuring of the economy and industry in
countries which are the major markets of Jordan Phos-
phate (iv) Lifting of government subsidies, on fer-
tilizers, in a number of countries in South East Asia,
as   a   result  of  decanalization  and  privitization
policies. (v) The growing environmental and health
measures and restrictions in importing countries espe-
cially in EEC countries, Australia and Newzeland.
Accordingly phosphate rock world demand shrank from
about 48 million tonnes in 1989 to about 24m tonnes in
1993.
To face the above challenges JPMC was, therefore, com-
pelled to modify its sector policy by adopting new
strategies which can be summarized as follows:
2



i.   The company has adopted a cost driven policy based
on mining the most economical orebodies at exist-
ing mines and to expedite Eshidiya Mine develop-
ment for its lower unit cost, as compared to the,
higher cost of El-Hassa and El-Abiyad mine areas.
ii. The full integration of mining and fertilizer
operations  in  terms  of  management,   planning,
budgeting and accounting.   Accordingly, Phosphate
fines and other subcommercial grades are being
utilized at the Fertilizer Complex at Aqaba and
also in the Joint-Venture Projects.
iii. To increase the local consumption of phosphate ore
by the end of 1999 to about 4 MTPY, by estab-
lishing a number of Joint-Venture Companies for
the production of down-stream intermediates and
final fertilizers products such as : Phosphoric
acid, NPK, DAP ..  etc.   This policy will help in
securing a captive supply for about 40-50% of
JPMC's annual production of commercial & subcom-
mercial grades on the one hand, and in diversify-
ing JPMC products on the other hand.
iv. Jordan Phosphate rock exports throughout 1995 to
2002 is envisaged to be in the range of 4-5.5 mil-
lion TPY.
V.   To utilize the medium and sub-commercial grades of
Phosphate  rock  locally,   while  exporting  high
grades only.
It is anticipated that the above factors together with
the   maximization   of   the  domestic  value  in  the
downstream products will increase the economics of the
sector and definitely will enhance the ability of JPMC
to adjust to the variations in the World market demand.
2.   Physical Objectives:
__________________
The main objective of the Early Production Scheme was
to produce 1.5 MTPY of high grade phosphate rock at the
end of 1989. The production in 1993 and 1994 were 0.65
million tonnes and 1 million tonnes respectively.   The
production in 1995 is scheduled to reach 1.35 MT equal
to 90% of plant planned capacity. Full production will
be reached in 1996 after the completion of construction
and commissioning of the Beneficiation Plant by the end
of 1995 ( under Loand 3172-JO).
3



The delay of production build up could be attributed to
the following reasons:
i.   Re-bidding associated with lengthy evaluation  and
contracting of major mining equipment (draglines
and dump trucks) due to non-responsivness and over
budget bid prices initially received. This has
caused an inevitable procurement and production
delay of about 9 months.
ii.  The Gulf crisis and its consequent  repercussions,
whereby the construction and commissioning of the
two   draglines,   the   handling   and   load-out
facilities (which lies on the critical path of the
project implementation schedule), were delayed by
another 12 months.   Foreign contractors  and  ex-
patriate  supervisors  were    instructed by their
governments to leave the site.
iii. Low draglines' performance: The rehandling by
draglines of the spoils excavated from the box cut
had not worked as planned. According to the mining
plan the spoils were to be heaped along the sides
of the box cut with a height of 2m to ease its
rehandling by dragline again into the box cut
after the removal of the phosphate ores.   Due  to
poor haul truck availability and utilization at-
tributed mainly to the tack of spare parts caused
by the Gulf Ware, the spoil were heaped closer to
the box cut at heights exceeding the planned
height by 4m, in order to the shorten the hauling
cycle time.   This arrangement impacted negatively
the draglines effective digging capacity and the
production from A2 by 201.
iv. The build-up of excessive large stocks of subcom-
mercial, from Al and A3 layers due to the delays
in the construction of the beneficiation plants.
V.   The  big  decline  in phosphate rock export levels
due to the drastic changes in the world market.
JPMC exports in 1993 were 3.56 million tonnes and
3.83 million tonnes in 1994: as compared to 6.5
million tonne exported in 1989 and B million
tonnes envisaged to be in 1994.
Nonetheless,   the  following  major  objectives   were
successfully achieved:
4



i.  The  completion  of  construction ahead of time of
the infrastructure required for the project and
for future developments.
ii. Inspite of all delays, the project was completed
at a lower than anticipated investment cost.
iii. High quality phosphate rock from A2 layer is cur-
rently produced at a reduced cost in comparison
with similar grades at existing mines.    Eshidiya
production in 1994 has represented about 25 of
JPMC total exports.
iv. The total production in 1994 (1 million tonnes)
was   completely   sold  to  new  markets  in  EEC
countries and Australia.
V.   Phosphate fines dust emission at the Mine  and  at
Aqaba port was successfully suppressed by using
efficient  dust  collectors  at  the   mines   and
shiploaders.    The  collected phosphate fines and
sub-commercial grades were utilized at the Fer-
tilizer Unit in Aqaba for the production of Phos-
phoric Acid.
3.   Institutional developments:
__________________________
The following institutional developments were  success-
fully   achieved   during  the  implementation  of  the
project.
i.  The  consolidation   of   phosphate   mining   and
downstream Production of phosphoric Acid and fer-
tilizers, associated with successful integration
of activities for the two units.
ii. Through the technical assistance programme for
(production, planning and financial management)
the company has succeeded in improving on the ex-
isting level of integration between technical,
marketing, financing functions in the company.
Also, it has completed effectively the overall
corporate restructuring plans of upgrading and in-
tegrating the administration, internal audit, cost
and   financial   accounting  systems,   financial
studies and budgeting, spare parts management and
technical functions (exploration and geology, min-
ing,  processing).   Consequent corporate restruc-
turing requirements have been identified, and an
executive implementation project unit was formed
5



to enable the achievement of the plan by 1996.
4.   Ecology Improvements:
___________________
From the outset serious environmental hazards threaten-
ing the ecology at the mine site were not foreseen and
none  have  developed.    Dust emission from the mining
roads is contained by spraying with water, regularly,
while from mine installation and equipment, phosphate
dust  is  collected  by  cyclones   and   electrostatic
precipitators   and   the   fines   are  recovered  and
transported to Aqaba for processing at the Fertilizer
plant.
The  key  environmental  issues  addressed in the "loan
Agreement" covered mainly dust emissions at Aqaba port,
emitted from the phosphate loading and unloading han-
dling facilities.  In this regard JPMC procured a local
consultant  to monitor the dust levels at various loca-
tions surrounding the port area as well as Aqaba  town.
The study has established that the dust generated in
the environ of Aqaba town was due to dust blown from
the surrounding desert areas expect in the port proper,
the phosphate dust was measurable.
To this end, JPMC committed itself to the following
program:
1.   De-dusting of phosphate fines at the mine sites to
minimize dust arriving at port.
2.   Utilization of phosphate fines recovered and  it's
successful processing at the Fertilizer Complex.
3.   Procurement  &  installation  of  choke-feeders at
ship-loaders which reduced dust emission by 90Z.
Ship-loaders were the main culprit of phosphate
dust plume which can be seen then miles away.
4.   Installation of dust  collection  devices  at  the
loading & unloading points in the port.
As a result of these measures, fugitive dust at
the   port   area   was   minimized.        However,
methodological housekeeping at the port site will
further decrease fugitive dust emission, whereby
Aqaba port phosphate loading facilities will be-
come one of the world outstanding clean harbors.
5.   Financial Objectives:
____________________
The feasibility study analysis had shown very high
6



financial and economical benefits of the project.   The
financial rate of return (FRR) of the Base case was 36%
and 15.6% under worst sensitivity analysis scenario.
The Base case Economic Rate of Return (ERR) was 37% and
16.9% also under worst sensitivity  analysis  scenario.
The actual Financial and Economical indicators still
show very strong financial and economic benefits. The
actual (FRR) and (ERR) based on real 1994 terms are
somewhat lower than the originally forecasted figures,
due to the following reasons: (i) The low build-up of
production and exports; (ii) The consequent higher than
forecasted working capital management; (iii) the higher
transport cost; due to new axle-load charges imposed on
trucks hauling to Aqaba.  (iv) 230% increase in   Aqaba
port charges. (v) Imposition by the government of JD 5
per tonne production tax. Actual indicators were as
follows:
* FRR : 10%
**ERR : 21%
* Inclusive of (production tax).
*"Exclusive of (production tax).
C-   Implementation Record and Major Factors
Affecting the Project:
---------------------------------------
Considering the overall achievement of project objec-
tives  as summarized under paras 1 and 2.   The project
can be considered as a substantial success.   The delay
in project implementation, production build up can be
attributed to:
1.   Factors not Generally subject to
JPMC'S control:
---------------------------------
i.   Delay in mining equipment procurement due to  non-
responsivness of Bidders and over budget bid
prices.     Contracts  were  eventually  finalized
within budget limitation at the expense of 9
months delay in project implementation schedule.
ii. The Gulf war and it consequent aftermath as
associated   with   difficulties  in  spare  parts
procurement which impacted the availability and
utilization of mining equipment and lowered the
number of ships arriving to Aqaba port, causing
serious export problems.
iii. Delay in construction of Beneficiation plant (under
Loan 3172-JO) caused by: (i) delay in floating the
Bid (ICB) by 9 months due to Gulf War (ii) Lengthy
7                                   4



discussions with the Bidders during Bids evalua-
tions stage due to 60% overbudget Bid price in the
initial bids received.  The contract was finalized
successfully and within budget limits.    However,
this process of avoiding capital over-run has
caused an additional delay in project implementa-
tion  of about 6 months.   (iii) The K.D 8 million
fund short-fall created by the cancellation from
one  side  by  Kuwait Government,   of the Kuwaity
loan extended by Kuwaity Fund for financing the
Integrated Phosphate Project ( Loan 3172-JO). The
company was compelled to cover the fund short-
fall by a local loan from a consortium of local
Banks.   The time  required  for  concluding  this
loan Agreement caused a further delay of 5 months.
The resulting 20 months delay in the construction
of the Beneficiation plant and the consequent
delay in processing the lower quality (Al and A3)
ore, has caused the build-up of an excessive
stockpiles from these grades. Thus any attempt to
increase the production from A2 will consequently
lead to substantial increase in the level of the
stock piles and the company's working capital.
iv.  The   above   three   factors  together  with  the
deterioration  of  world  phosphate  demand   were
responsible for the slow production build up.
2.   Factors subject to JPMC Control:
The failure of the company to allocate a fully ex-
perienced key management, operation and maintenance
staff at the project start-up of production has led to
some deficiencies in the implementation of mining plan
during the opening of the Box-Cut needed for draglines
operations. The spoils from the Box cut were heaped to
heights which hindered dragline productive digging
capacity.   The draglines have to spend  more  time  on
rehandling the spoils contrary to plan. In addition, an
inadequate maintenance management associated with scar-
city of spare parts has resulted in lower than normal
availability  and  utilization  of   equipment,   lower
production and higher mining unit cost. This issue was
corrected at the later stage of implementation.
E.   Project Sustainability:
______________________
The production from A2 Layer is expected to reach its
targeted capacity during 1996 after the completion of
construction and commissioning of the Beneficiation
8



plant scheduled at the end of 1995. Considering the
long experience of JPMC in developing, operating, and
maintaining similar mining equipment and beneficiation
plants,   in allocating when needed the required trades
and expertise, the experience and capability of absorb-
ing new up-to-date    technologies  &  by  implementing
successful  technology transfer programmes.   This com-
piled  with  the  strong  financial  benefits  of   the
project, makes us very assured that the project will be
fully sustainable.
E.   JPMC Performance:
________________
The performance of JPMC (The Borrower) can be ranked as
highly  satisfactory.    This  company  has efficiently
handled the following tasks:
i.   The preparation cf the feasibility study and bank-
able report of ar. International standard, which
was very instrumental to the bank in carrying the
project appraisa.
ii. The preparation cf all project basic engineering,
designs, and drawings.
iii. Preparation of --he Bidding Documents and handling
of all internat:dnal and local procurement in a
very expeditiou: and professional manner which
resulted in a sa-ing of US Dollars 7.7 million of
project installa:ion cost.
iv. Organized project construction efficiently. The
main infrastructure: roads, electric power, water
supply, telephore service, housing facilities,
mine support  workshops  and  stores...etc.,  were
developed ahead cf time. Except for draglines and
dump trucks,  al' other mining and handling equip-
ment were purchaEed, constructed and commissioned
on schedule.
V.   JPMC  has  managed  under tight market competition
caused  by   depressed   international   phosphate
market, to develop new markets for Eshidiya Ore in
Europe  and  Australia.   The company had faced no
difficulties in selling all quantities produced
from Eshidiya.
vi. With the valuable assistance of the world Bank un-
der (Technical assistance programme), the company
had succeeded in up-grading its capability in
respect to spare parts and working capital manage-
ment. Also, in implementing production and finan-
9                                 et\



cial corporate planning management which assisted
the company to adopt more efficient cost-driven
policies.
vii. The weakness of JPMC as previously discussed   was
limited  to    not transferring on the appropriate
time the best experienced personnel to assist in
the proper of start-up of mining operations.
viii.JPMC   was   in  full  compliance  with  all  loan
covenants, until the imposition by the Government
at a later stage of the production tax (JD
5/tonne).   This have affected in increasing  JPMC
consolidated working ratio slightly above the
ratio covenanted in the Loan Agreement (0.8), by
excluding this tax the projected financial working
ratio is (0.72) in 1994. According to the projec-
tions in the newly developed five years plan the
company will face no problem in complying with
all loan Agreements' covenants staring from 1995.
F.  Bank Performance:
The performance of the bank can be rated as highly
satisfactory.   From the outset starting  with  project
appraisal through implementation, impact assessment
and until project completion, the Bank had provided
the Company with valuable assistance in the technical
fields, production planning skills, management and
financial matters all of which were very instrumental
in upgrading the company's performance to an interna-
tional standard level.
The Bank further had successfully pinpointed the areas
and subjects were the company needs improvements.
Through its technical assistance programme, the Bank
had  successfully  managed  to  upgrade   the   company
capabilities   in  new  fields:  Flotation  techniques,
processing, working capital and spare parts management,
development of the company's corporate and production
planning, and the development of financial management.
The assistance of the Bank was highly appreciated
during the prevailed depressed phosphate world market,
in correctly advising the company in maximizing cash
flow and profitability by the liquidity of the existing
huge stocks, of final and semi-final products, and in
advising more cost driven policy. The focus on cleaner
environment  at  Port  of  Aqaba   phosphate   handling
facilities was successfully achieved in 1993.

G.   Assessment of outcome:
_____________________
Considering the achievement of project major objec-
tives, while the production build-up is expected to
reach the target level at the end of 1995, and the sus-
tained  strong   project   financial   and   economical
benefits, the project outcome is considered satisfac-
tory, and will definitely make a substantial contribu-
tion to the company's financial position as well as
country's economy and its foreign exchange earnings.
H.   Future Operations:
_________________
After the completion of construction and commissioning
of   the   Beneficiation  plant  (under  Loan  3172-JO)
scheduled at the end of 1995, the project production
will reach 3.25 MTPY, out of which 1.5 million TPY from
the  layer (A2).   The Company's Board of Directors has
already took a decision to start implementing Eshidiya
Phase 2, increasing production at the end of 1998 up to
6.5 million tonnes per year, in order to cover the
needs of the Phosphoric acid and Fertilizers Joint Ven-
ture Projects and to compensate for the loss of produc-
tion  from  El-Hassa  and   El-Abiyad   mines.        The
feasibility study for Eshidiya Phase 2 is scheduled to
be completed by mid 1995.
I-   Key lessons learned:
___________________
The main lessons learned are: (i) JPMC staff and
project  team  are  experienced  and   capable of effi-
ciently handling the implementation of large projects
of this size and caliber. (ii) The rock phosphate and
fertilizer World market is cyclic in nature and is
governed by a large number of variables and uncer-
tainties, which makes it very unpredictable. A company
like JPMC which is 100% export dependent, has to adopt
flexible policies of production, diversification of
products , financials  and marketing to enable it to ad-
just quickly to any unforeseen circumstances.
