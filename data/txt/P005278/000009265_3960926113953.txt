I. INTRODUCTION
A. Background
1.01      The Jordan Phosphate Mines Company Ltd.(JPMC), in which the
Government of Jordan is the majority shareholder, has requested a Bank loan
of US$31.0 million equivalent to help finance the Shidiya Phosphate Mine
Project. Phosphate is the most important of Jordan's mineral resources and
provides substantial foreign exchange earnings (US$231 million gross in
1986) through the export of phosphate rock and thereby makes a substantial
contribution to Gross National Product. A portion of phosphate production
provides feed to JPMC's chemical fertilizer plant at Wadi II on the Aqaba
Gulf coast and the export of fertilizer yields additional foreign exchange
earnings (US$113 million gross in 1986). The Project will be the first
stage development of the Shidiya deposit which contains vast reserves of
phosphate rock. The project will increase Jordan's phosphate rock
production by 1.5 million tonnes per year (mtpy) to a level of 8.2 mtpy by
1989 and will increase export of phosphate rock to 7.1 mtpy by 1989. It
will provide a foundation for future phases of mine development at Shidiya.
which could ultimately reach a combined production level in excess of 10
mtpy rock product within the next 10 years when all other existing
phosphate mine areas in Jordan are expected to reach the end of their
physical/economic life. The new deposit will provide Jordan with a low
production cost base for the long-term development of its phosphate
industry.
B. Bank Role and Sector Lending Strategy
1.02     Jordan's last two national development plans aimed at
restructuring the economy to achieve a wider manufacturing base, reduce
dependency on external grants and spread development among different
regions. The Bank's assistance to Jordan has been designed to support
these objectives, and in particular (i) diversify the country's economic
base; (ii) promote exports; (iii) alleviate manpower and infrastructure
constraints in the productive sector; and (iv) encourage a more balanced
growth among regions. Their objective- are discussed in detail in the
Bank's review of the 1981-85 Five-Year Plan (Report No. 4179-JO of May
1983); in a study on Export Strategy and Promotion in Manufacturing
Industries (Report No. 4170-JO of June 1983); and a Development Study on
Employment Strategy and Growth, in the context of a weakening regional
demand for Jordanian labor (Report No. 5117-JO of June 1984).
1.03      Bank assistance in the industrial sector is directed at a better
utilization of domestic resources and manpower skill, toward the
establishment of a broader export-oriented industrial base. Hitherto, Bank
involvement in the industrial sector consisted of a pilot Engineering
Credit (1975) in the potash sector; a Potash Project (1978j; an Energy
Development Project (1983); several Power Projects; and a Second Potash
Project (1986). IFC's involvement in Jordan has been in the production of
ceramic tiles, aluminum fluoride, phosphate fertilizers, and bricks, and
for the development of Amman capital market. The Bank's involvement in the



-2-
phosphate mining sector to increase phosphate rock exports and expand
utilization of the country's natural resources is, therefore, within the
Bank's sector lending strategy.
Co Rationale for Bank Involvement
1.04      In late 1981, the Government of Jordan requested the Bank to
assist in reviewing terms of reference for a pre-feasibility study at
Shidiya. Over the 1982-86 period, the Bank has continuously assisted the
Government to monitor project preparation and the Government and JPMC to
Identify an optimum project configuration of manageable financial propor-
tions, and has successfully advised the Government and JPMC regarding
reducing the project size from 9 mtpy to 1.5 mtpy.
1.05      The rationale for Bank involvement is that (i) the Bank will
continue to provide technical advice and assistance to ensure a proper
techno-economic evaluation of further developments at Shidiya and an
optimal phasing of such development in relation to the depletion of
existing mines; (ii) the Bank's participation in the high eccnomic rate of
return initial phase of the Shidiya mine development will contribute to
restore potential private partners' confidence in JPMC for future expansion
phases, at a time when the financial impact of JPMC's absorption of the
Jordan Fertilizer 'ndustries Company (JFI) has put the company in a
temporary tight cash position and has considerably reduced JPMC's
traditionally impressive profitability; (iii) through the Project, the Bank
would work closely witlh JPMC to ensure that dust control measures are taken
to reduce dust pollution at Aqaba port to internationally accepted environ-
mental standards; and (iv) the Project will increase the country's exports
by about US$45 million per year at a time when remittances from Jordanian
workers in the Gulf countries are stagnating, and Arab countries' grants
are becoming scarcer.
1.06     The project was appraised in May 1987, by a mission consisting of
Messrs. C. Wardell, A. Covindassamy, and W.F. Sheldrick (Bank) and Messrs.
J. Cape, J. Moussalli, S. Houghtaling and G. Richards (Consultants).
II. THE JORDAN PHOSPHATE MINES COMPANY LTD. (JPMC)
A. History
2.01      Phosphate deposits were discovered in Jordan in 1908, during the
construction of the Hijaz railway linking Amman to Aqaba. JPMC was formed
in 1953 with a capital of JD 1 million, to exploit the phosphate deposits
at Ruseifa, 15 kilometers north of Amman. In 1962, mining commenced at the
El Hassa mine, 136 kms south of Amman and 200 kilometers north of Aqaba
port. The company further expanded in 1979 with the start of production at
the El Abiad mine, 20 kilometers north of the El Hassa mine. The capital
of JPMC has increased several times and by the end of 1986 had reached JD
20.0 million, of which 90% is owned by the Government of Jordan, and the
remaining 10% by many thousand Jordanian private shareholders. In late
1986, the Government placed the operation and management of the JFI's



-3-
chemical plant at Aqaba under the responsibility of JPMC. JPMC Board of
Directors approved in 1987 a resolution to increase the company's capital
by 50% (JD 10 million) by floating no par shares on the Amman stock market,
to be purchased by private investors at a price 1402 above the nominal
value of the shares. When this capital increase (para. 6.21) is obtained,
it would provide JPMC with about JD 25 million in cash (including JD 14
million of paid-in surplus), and will put about 40% of JPMC capital in
private hands.
B.   Organization and Management
2.02      JPMC is a commercial enterprise, with the status of a commercial
corporation under the general supervision of the Ministry of Industry and
Trade. It is managed by a Board comprised of members appointed by the
Ministry of Industry and Trade, and one member represents the private
shareholders, (Annex 2-1). The Board nominates, from among its members,
the Managing Director. Directors of the main departments are selected by
the Managing Director, subject to Board approval. Below the Director
level, appointments are made by the Managing Director. JPMC's management
is satisfactory and highly efficient. The allocatior of responsibilities
between the Ministry, the Board and the Managing Director is satisfactory,
and entrusts the Board with corporate strategy, while the Managing Director
is fully in charge of operations and management with sufficient freedom of
action regarding operations, personnel management, investment and borrowing
policy, marketing, foreign currency management and finance.
2.03      The company's Management Information Systems (MIS) in the Mining
Unit are satisfactory, in particular for cost accounting, personnel
administration and geological research. Data are readily and quickly
available, and part of the MIS is computerized. MIS development is less
advancel in the Fertilizer Unit, but will be progressively modernized,
using the Mining Unit system as a model.
2.04      Following JFI's absorption, JPMC is reorganizing itself, on the
basis that the production units (Mining and Fertilizer) will keep their
respective operational and managerial autonomy, while the functional
departments would be common to both units. In the functional departments,
the integration for marketing and finance is well advanced. No major
changes ate needed in the technical units. However, the integration of the
administrative, internal audit, corporate planning and budgeting functions
is less advanced. Such integration is necessary to improve cost effective-
ness. During negotiations, assurance was obtained on the implementation
of an iction Plan for Managerial Integration (Annex 2-2) to complete JFI
absorption, regarding (i) the integration of the Administrative Department;
(ii) strengthening of Financial Studies; (iii) the development of fully
compatible financial and cost accounting systems; and (iv) the
establishment of Planning, Internal Audit, Management Control, Financial
Studies and Budgeting units. Further development of the Financial Studies,
Corporate Planning, and Internal Audit Units will be facilitated through
the project technical assistance component (para. 4.27).

2.06      The quality of the workforce in term  of qualifications,
experience, commitment and initiative is good at all levels and labor
relations are good. Personnel management is centralized, the Managing
Director has complete autonomy regarding job grading, staff hiring,
remuneration, reassignment, performance evaluation, promotion and
sanctions. This freedom is used effectively and individual performance
is the determining factor for salary increases and promotions.
2.07      The Company has developed over many years of mine operations, a
team of highly qualified and experienced managerial personnel, technicians,
skilled and semi-skilled workers and the existing mining operations can be
considered highly productive. Since the closure of the Ruseifa mine in
late 1985, 461 mine personnel have been kept on payroll.  Many of the
managerial, technical and skilled and semi-skilled workers from Ruselfa
will find employment at Shidiya starting 1987. In late 1986, JPMC absorbed
within its organization the former JFI personnel at the fertilizer plant,
including plant management and all on-site operational, maintenance and
administrative personnel.
2.08      Because of its attractive pay scales, JPMC has no problem
recruiting and training personnel at all levels and there is an ample
supply of skilled labor. Polytechnic institutions (Amman, Irbid, Tafila)
run by the Ministry of Education have mining departments which yield
annually approximately 100 engineers and technicians. JPMC operates its
own training centres at El Hassa and Ruseifa for mechanical and electrical
maintenance and welding, which yield about 40 technicians per year.
Extensive on the job training opportunities exist within JPMC and the



-5-
company has recruited machine operators and skilled technicians/maintenance
personnel from other industrial sectors and among personnel returning from
Gulf states.
2.09      The salary level offered by JPMC is competitive with the private
sector, but reflects the high cost of skilled labor in Jordan, due to the
existence of employment opportunities in the Gulf states. The median
salary level is about JD 250 per month (US$755) plus housing, health and
pension benefits. The salary range is relatively narrow, from JD 200 per
month to JD 700 per month. This gives JMPC a strong incentive for
mechanization and efficient personnel arrangement.
D. Current and Future Operations
1. Mining Unit
2.10      In the last decade, despite a weak world market for phosphate,
Jordan has increased its annual production at an average rate of 15% and
has tripled its exports of phosphate rock as summarized below. Jordan is
now the fifth largest phosphate rock producer after the USA, the USSR,
Morocco, and China, and the third largest exporter of phosphate rock after
Morocco and the USA.

2.11      Mines.  JPMC currently operate two open-pit mines, at El Hassa
and El Abiad (IBRD Map Nos. 19920 and 19922) . Following recent upgrading
of beneficiation plant facilities these mines have production design
capacities of 4.1 mtpy (El Hasss) and 3.0 mtpy (El Abiad). Total
production of phosphate rock in 1987 is expected to reach 6.7 mt, 4.0 mt
from El Hassa and 2.7 mt from El Abiad. The mines essentially produce two
grades of phosphate rock, Standard and Concentrate. The standard (S)
grade--70/72 TCP1/--is obtained after simple screening and drying of the
1/ TCP (Tricalcium phosphate) is equivalent to 0.46 units of P205.



-6-
higher quality run-of-mine (ROM) ore and the concentrate (C) grade--73/75
TCP--is a washed product resulting from wet beneficiation itavolving removal
of oversize, slimes and chlorine. Intermediate grades 71/73 and 72/74 can
be produced by blending when market conditions favor those alternate
products. The ratio of production of S to C grades is approximately 3:1 at
El Hassa and 2:1 at El Abiad.
2.12      Mining at El Hassa and El Abiad has traditionally been by mobile
mining equipment - trucks and shovels. JPMC has effectively employed
local contractors extensively to supplement its own limited fleets of
mobile equipment. A total of 48-49 million bank (in situ) cubic meters
(BCM) of excavation, including 5 million BCM phosphate ore, is planned to
yield the 6.7 mtpy of phosphate rock in 1987, corresponding to an overall
stripping ratio of 9.6 m3 of overburden to 1 m3 of phosphate ore.  In 1981,
in order to reduce overburden excavation cost, JFMC procured a 30 m3
dragline (the first large dragline in the Middls East) and placed its
operation in the hands of an international mining contractor. Dragline
production, availability and utilization proved to be excellent. In 1983,
JPMC took over the dragline and its operation is now comparable to any
international standards for such equipmenc. On the basis of this
experience, JPMC is procuring three additional draglines, one 30 m3 and two
15 m3, which will replace contract mining operations, thus reducing unit
excavation costs.
2.13      Beneficiation.  At El Hassa and El Abiad, ore is transported from
the mining areas to crushing and screening stations by trucks and conveyor
belts. Conveyor belts also connect the crushing stations with the
beneficiation plants. All the facilities are well maintained. Screening
oversize is rejected to waste stockpiles and undersize (70/72 grade) is
dried to less than 2% moisture to produce S grade phosphates. Undersize
(66/68 grade) is fed to log washers, slurrifiers and wet screens.
Undersize from the wet screens is agitated, then fed to hydrocyclones where
overflow (slimes) is rejected and underflow fed to filters to produce
phosphate cake. Cake moisture is reduced to less than 2%, by drying, to
produce 73/75 C grade concentrates.
2.14      Ore Reserves.  JPMC has over 1 billion tonnes "proved" geological
ore reserves and in excess of 1.7 billion tonnes "total" reserves. Total
reserves are likely to increase as further exploration is undertaken at
Shidiya in the 1987-89 period.

2.15      Not all the above reserves can be exploited profitably.  Mining
operations at Ruseifa have recently been discontinued and research is now
planned to attempt to establish whether new and alternate beneficiation
technology would enable the remaining reserves to be exploited economical-
ly. At El Hassa and El Abiad, the limited remaining proven economically
recoverable reserves (at stripping ratios less than 15:1 m3 overburden/m3
ROM ore) will enable planned production of 6.7 mtpy phosphate concentrates
to continue only to 1991. Thereafter, production will gradually decline
and the El Abiad mine will probably be exhausted in 1992 and El Hassa in
1997.
2.16      Total geological ore reserves at Shidiya exceed 1.3 billion
tonnes, with the full lateral extent of the deposit not fully defined. The
reserves at Shidiya are located in two areas, the Western Ore Body and the
Eastern Ore Body. The proved reserves of 964 mt are primarily in the
Western Ore Body and the probable reserves of 250 mt in the Eastern Ore
Body. Proved reserves, following beneficiation, would yield approximately
400 mt of phosphate rock product (minitam 70/72 TCP), indicating a product-
ion potential of 15-20 mtpy over a 20-25 year period. The Eastern Ore Body
is considered to have an additional potential in excess of 5 mtpy over a
similar period. The proposed project (production level of 1.5 mtpy for 20
years) would tap less t.han 5% of the potentially recoverable phosphate rock
in the Western Ore Body.
2.17      Two other potential reserve areas have been identified by JPMC.
First, the Wadi Taibe field, 60 kilometers north of Amman is estimated to
contain at least 370 million tonnes phosphate rock in a single thick (10 m)
bed. These reserves are not included in Jordan's reserve tabulation due to
uncertainties regarding the economic viability of phosphate beneficiation.
Second, an area of phosphate is known to exist adjacent to the Iraq border
but little data is yet available about the extent and quality of the rock.
2.18      Research.  JPMC has centralized the Company's research efforts at
a research center adjacent to Ruseifa, north of Amman. Facilities include
equipment and personnel to undertake mineralogical investigation, benefici-
ation and phosphoric acid/fertilizer (bench and pilot plant scale)
research.
2.19      Infrastructure.  Water supply for potable and industrial use at
El Hassa and El Abiad is tapped from wells and is more than adequate for
plant requirements. Electric power is provided from the grid of the Jordan
Electricity Authority (JEA), the state-owned electric company and power
supply has not been a problem. Workshop and warehouse facilities at
existing mines have recently been upgraded and provide a comprehensive
maintenance and spare parts facillty that secures levels of equipment
availability that are comparable to international open-pit mining
standards. Materials managemert in warehouse facilities is manual but is
efficiently handled by a well-organized cardex system. Warehouse space is
made available for all manufacturers and suppliers of new mining equipment
to make spare parts available on a three year "consignment" basis,
following commissioning of new mining equipment.

2. Fertilizer Unit
2.20     In 1981/82, JFI constructed a phosphate fertilizer plant at Wadi
II, 6 km south-east of Aqaba. The plant was designed to produce 740,000
tpy Di-ammonium phosphate (DAP) and 56,000 tpyI/ phosphoric acid for
export. Construction cost was estimated at US$300 million equivalent.
During 1982, substantial (US$140 million) cost overruns were incurred.
From the outset of operations, starting late 1982, plant operations were
beset by technical difficulties and deficiencies, most of which were
eliminated by 1986. By 1985, JFI was facing severe financial difficulties,
mainly due to rapidly deteriorating international fertilizer prices and the
high debt service. Following negotiation with shareholders (including IFC)
the Government decided in 1986 to integrate JFI within the JPMC organiza-
tion, and to compensate other shareholders, including IFC, at book value as
of December 31, 1985. The Government, through a Special Fund for the
Fertilizer Sector, took on part of the outstanding debt (about JD 65
million) under a special agreement. According to this agreement, future
profit of the Fertilizer Unit will be allocated in full to the reimburse-
ment of this debt, and after full reimbursement of this debt, 5% of profit
will be paid to the Special Fund. JPMC purchased JFI fixed assets, current
assets less current liabilities at book value for JD 60 million paid
through the cancellation of JD 14 million of JFI commercial debts to JPMC;
taking over JD 24 million of outstanding long-term debts, and JD 16 million
of financial commitments to the Arab Bank (Saudi Arabia); and the payment
to miscellaneous creditors of JD 6 million of JFI's short-term debts.
2.21      At full design capacity, the fertilizer plant was to consume 1.3
mtpy phosphate rock from the El Hassa and El Abiad mining operations,
however, it is not likely that the plant can exceed 85% of design capacity,
which is satisfactory in the Jordanian context. Hence, the plant's actual
phosphate rock consumption is not expected to exceed 1.; mtpy. The plant
was designed to be fed with 73/75 grade rock. Following initial operation
difficulties, the rock feed was adjusted to a mix of 70/72 and 73/75
grades. JPMC is now investigating the possibility of supplying the plant
with lower grade phosphate rock-either dust/slimes to be collected at the
mines, or 66/68, or other sub-commercial grades. The supply of sub-
commercial phosphate grades, if technically feasible, will on the one hand,
lower the output of the plant, increase sulphur consumption and therefore
increase unit production costs, but on the other hand, "free' higher grade
phosphate to the export market. A study on the technical feasibility and
financial attractiveness of this possibility is to be financed under the
proposed Project (para. 4.25).
2.22.     Following the reorganization of the Fertilizer Unit, its
management is satisfactory, and maintenance tasks are performed as
scheduled. The Fertilizer Unit's technical department was able in 1986 to
resolve most of its cooling and filtration problems, which permitted a
2/ In tonnes of P205.



-9-
sizeable improvement in the unit production capacity. Further improvement
was carried out in 1987 and will be reflected in 1987 production
statistics.
E.   Accounting Arrangements and Audit
2.23      JPMC's accounts are satisfactorily kept, although t1} accounting
systems and procedures of the Mining and Fertilizer Units are still not
fully compatible, creating a problem for financial consolidation. A common
system is expected to be in effect by December 1987. The Company's
accounting staff is qualified and book-keeping is efficient: JPMC produces
a full set of financial statements every quarter, and the unaudited annual
financial statements are available two months after the end of each fiscal
year. The company's accounts are audited every semester by qualified
external private auditors applying internationally accepted standards.
During negotiations, assurances were obtained that JPMC would continue to
keep separate accounts for the Mining and Fertilizer Units in addition to
consolidated accounts at the company level; and that JPMC would provide the
Bank with audited financial statements within six months of the close of
each fiscal year.
III. THE MARKET FOR PHOSPHATE ROCK AND PHOSPHATE FERTILIZERS
3.01.     The proposed Project will increase Jordan's export capacity by
1.5 mtpy, representing only 2.7% of 1990 phosphate rock world trade and
less than 1% of world production. This additional production will be
absorbed by the expanding Asian and Far Eastern markets, and replace
production from depleting mines in the Oceania area. In the fertilizer
sector, JPMC will not increase its capacity, and its world market share
will gradually decline. Phosphate rock prices and fertilizer prikee are
both forecast to recover slightly from their present depressed level.
Under these prudent assumptions, marketing does not present a major risk
for the Project or JPMC as a company, as the analysis in this chapter will
show.
3.02      The phosphate world market affects the Project in three ways.
First, the additional 1.5 mtpy phosphate rock production from the Project
must be readily marketable without disrupting the world phosphate rock
export market and without excessive risk. Second, the future phosphate
rock market affects directly the economic justification of the project
through forecasted rock prices, and third, future fertilizer and rock
prices and demand affect JPMC's future financial position and viability.
Detailed analysis on world supply/demand for phusphate fertilizers and
rock, main producar's strategy and market shares are available in the
Project File.
A. Phosphate Fertilizer World Demand/Supply
3.03      World phosphate fertilizer supply/demand growth is projected to
be slower (3.5% p.a.) than the past 15 years (3.7% p.a.), because of the
depressed world food market and excess fertilizer supply capacity.



-10-
However, most of the demand and supply increases will take place in Asia,
where Jordan enjoys a particularly competitive position for phosphate
fertilizer exports (which depends on world demand) and phosphate rock
exports (which depends on world supply). In the past, world demand for
phosphate fertilizers increased by an average 3.7% p.a. over the 1970-85
period. However, the demand growth had sharp regiona: variations. The
higher growth rates were in Eastern Europe (4.8% p.a.) and in developing
countries (8.5% p.a.), mainly Asia (10.7% p.a.) and Africa (6.0% p.a.),
while the demand from developed countries remained stagnant Annex 3-1).

3.04      World phosphate fertilizer supply capacity matched closely the
demand until mid-1970.  The 1974 price boom (para. 3.12) induced phosphate
fertilizer producers to increase their production capacity: the world
production capacity nearly doubled over the 1970-85 period, and exceeded
the demand growth of the late 1970's/early 1980's, resulting in an
estimated 4 mt production over capacity (12% of actual demand).
3.05      According to Bank forecasts, future world demand for P205
(phosphate nutrient) will continue to increase at a moderate rate of 3.0%
p.a. between 1986 and 1990 and 3.4% p.a. over the 1986-2000 period,
depending mainly on future world grain production and prices, crop response
to fertilizers, and solvency of demand (farm credit and fore.gn exchange
availability). Demand growth will originate mainly from Asia, Latin
America and Eastern Europe. The demand from developed countries 4s not
likely to increase significantly. World supply growth, on the other hand,
will slow down, allowing supply over-capacity to be gradually reduced and
to disappear by 1995. No new plant construction is expected to be
undertaken at least until the early 1990's, as market prices are below the
full production cost of new plants; but existing plants' utilization rate



-11-
will gradually increase, some 'mothballed" units may be re-commissioned
when rising prices exceed these units' marginal production cost.
Also, production facilities already under construction will come on stream
early 1990's (Tunisia, India, and Morocco). Future &upply is anticipated
to increase at 2.5% p.a. over the 1986-2000 period.
3.06      The world phosphate fertilizer supply growth (which affects
JPMC's Mining Unit export potential) is concentrated in regions where
Jordan enjoys a favorable geographical location, with lower freight rates
than its potential competitors. The world phosphate fertilizer demand
(which affects JPMC's Fertilizer Unit's export potential) is concentrated
in the same region, where Jordan has a comparative geographical advantage
(Annex 3-1).
B. World Phosphate Rock Supply
3.07      Phosphate rock supply growth is projected to be lower than in the
1970-85 period, due to the lower growth of phosphate fertilizer supply
(para. 3.03). The 1986-2000 production increase will take place in regions
(Morocco, Togo, and China for domestic use) which do not compete with
Jordan or JPMC's export market (mainly Asia). Over the period 1970-85,
world production of phosphate rock increased by an average 4.3% p.a.,
mainly from Jordan (11% p.a.), Morocco (5% p.a.), Togo (4X p.a.), and China
(4% p.a.).

3.08      In the future, phosphate rock production is estimated, according
to the Bank's International Economic Department (IRC) projection
(Annex 3-2), to increase at a lower rate of 2.4% p.a. over the 1985-2000
period. In North America, high production costs of potential new producers
is likely to prevent the opening of new mines, as long as prices remain at
their present low level. Depletion of existing reserves and the possible
closures of high cost marginal mines may reduce overall supply capacity by
about 2% p.a. after 1995. In Oceania, phosphate reserves will be depleted
by 1995-97, reducing supply by about 1.7 mtpy.



-12-
3.09      On the other hand, production from low cost mines is expected to
increase in certain countries. In addition to the proposed 1.5 mtpy
project in Jordan:
(i) In Morocco, ongoing projects are expected to increase rock
production capacity by about 10 mtpy by 1995;
(ii) In Eastern Europe (mainly the USSR), production capacity of
existing mines is expected to increase by some 5 mtpy by 1995;
(iii) In Latin America (Brazil, Mexico and Peru), production capacity
is expected to increase by 2 mtpy by 1995;
(iv) In China, output is expected to increase by 2 mtpy by 1995; and
(v) In Israel, a 1.6 mtpy production capacity increase is expected.
JPMC's envisaged 1.5 mtpy production increase after 1989 represents less
than 1Z of total world production and less than 14% of the 1986-89 annual
world production increase, and will not present a substantial threat to
existing rock producers.
C. Phosphate Rock Supply/Demand Balance and World Trade
3.10      Jordan's potential export market depends on the international
market for phosphate rock, and on the relative geographical location of
rock producers and rock processing chemical plants. In the pa3t, the
long-term trend was toward processing phosphate rock in rock producing or
sulphur producing countries, because of potential saving on transport cost
and the desire of input producing countries to increase the value added
content of their exports. This was the case in Tunisia, Morocco, Jordan
and some Gulf countries. This trend is expected to continue in the
long-run, but low fertilizer prices in the medium-term is expected to
provide incentives for exports of rock rather than fertilizer. However,
the tendency toward local processing is reflected in the difference between
projected phosphate rock consumption growth rate over the 1985-2000 period
(2.4% p.a.) and the expected growth rate of phosphate rock international
trade (1.9% p.a. only). The resulting future trade of phosphate rock is
described in detail in Annex 3-3 and summarized on the following page.

3.11      Phosphate rock international trade is expected to increase at a
lower rate than in the past. However, world trade will increase by 14
million tonnes from 1985 to 2000. The most promising export markets for
Jordan are in Asia (India, China, Indonesia) with a 4 mtpy additional
import potential and a high growth rate of 2.42 p.a., and East Europe with
a 7 mtpy additional Import potential and also a high 3.4% p.a. import
growth rate. Some additional demand for Jordan rock may come from
Mediterranean countries. Jordan's market share is analyzed in para. 3.15
below.
D. Phosphate Rock and Fertilizer Prices
3.12      Present phosphate fertilizer (DAP) and rock prices are at their
lowest level since 1974, because of the market excess supply situation
(paras. 3.04 and 3.07). However, future real prices are not forecast to
increase by more than 102 over the 1987-2000 period, because the excess



-14-
supply will be absorbed by the slowly increasing demand only in the early
19909, and some additional production capacity will come onstream after
1990. The anticipated price increase will take place between 1987 and 1990
for DAP and after 1989-90 for phosphate rock.
3.13      Phosphate Rock Prices.  World market prices for phosphate rock
over the 1965-86 period were on a long-term declining trend, except during
the 1974-80 boom period (Annex 3-4). In the past, long-term floor prices
were determined by production costs in the USA, which is the world's
largest producer, and fluctuations above this level were determined by the
supply-demand balance.
3.14      In the recent past, nominal prices increased slightly in the last
quarter of 1986, but by April 1987, they had dropped back to their early
1986 level, and it is doubtful that they will increase in the short-run.
In the future, real prices are expected to continue to fall slightly until
1989, due to the existing oversupply which will prevail until 1990-91.
Thereafter, long-term production cost is expected to increase moderately
driving prices up to their 1985 level in real terms, by the year 2000. The
resulting prices are summarized below. Jordanian average rock prices have
been consistently (US$2-3 per tonne) above the Moroccan or USA FOB prices,
because of the higher quality of most of the Jordanian rock. Jordanian
rock contains less impurities and requires less sulphuric acid per tonne of
rock for the production of phosphoric acid. The estimated savings for the
fertilizer producer is about US$3 per tonne of rock. In 1986, average
prices for Jordanian rock were US$30 for 70/72 TCP quality, and US$36 for
73/75 TCP quality.

Department's (IEC) projections.
3.15      Fertilizer Prices.  World market prices for phosphate fertilizer
in 1986, were at their lowest level in real terms in the post World War II
period (Annex 3-4). The market depression is due to the flat or declining
USA and West European fertilizer consumption. DAP prices reached a low of
about US$140 in December 1986, but recovered to US$180 in February 1987 to
drop back to $150 by March 1987. Since March 1987, prices have gone up to
US$190 per tonne. This increase, combined with a substantially higher
demand, may be the beginning of the long awaited price recovery. In the
short-run, DAP prices are expected to recover slightly in real terms
because 1986 prices are clearly below cash production costs even for
efficient producers. In the longer run, DAP prices are expected to
stabilize in real terms at their 1985 level, which is close to the marginal
producers' long-term marginal cost.

E. The Market for Jordanian Phosphate Rock and Fertilizer
3.16      Phosphate Rock.  In the past, Jordan pursued an aggressive
phosphate rock marketing strategy based on competitive pricing and utiliza-
tion of government-to-government agreements (Annex 3-5). Its world market
share has increased from 4.7% In 1978 to 10.4% in 1986, with exports
increasing at an average annual rate of 11.6% p.a., despite a depressed
world market. Domestic consumption in the fertilizer plant at Aqaba was
about I mtpy and will remain at that level in the future.

Jordan Market Share (%) 4.2    7.7    8.0    9.8   10.0   10.4          -
This impressive performance was achieved mainly in the Asian market (India,
Indonesia, Japan and Taiwan), the East European market (Poland, Romania and
Yugoslavia) and to a lesser extent, the West European market (France and
Turkey). Jordan's marketing effort has concentrated on markets where
Jordan has a comparative freight advantage, and was served by a flexible
pricing strategy. JPMC shared Jordan's freight advantage with the client
to be competitive with the CIF price of the best located competitor.
Compared to its major competitors (M4orocco and Tunisia), Jordan has a
freight advantage of about US$6 per tonne for India and Far East markets,
and small disadvantage (US$1 per tonne) for deliveries to Odessa, East and
West Europe. Jordan's strategy was also supported by a flexible approach
regarding countertrade and barter agreements which are, however, limited to
the purchase of JPKC major inputs (sulphur, ammonia) equipment, and consum-
ables. Also, the Jordan Government supports financial participation by
Jordanian companies in fertilizer companies abroad to establish preferred
trade channels.
3.17      Based on the 1986 market share situation, and allocating future
demand increases country-by-country to the least cost potential supplier,
future potential demand for Jordanian rock is expected to be strong because
(i) the markets where Jordan has a clear competitive advantage are develop-
ing rapidly (Asia--mainly India, Pakistan and Bangladesh, the Par East, and
to a lesser extent Eastern Europe), and (ii) Jordan can continue to pursue
a low-price policy without jeopardizing the phosphate company's financial
situation.
3.18      Over the 1985-95 period, Jordan's market shares are likely to
remain constant in the East European market (13% to 14%), and increase
substantially in the Asian market (28%-35%) and in the Oceania market (3%
to 37%). The substantial gain in market shares will be partly due to



-16-
replacement of depleted Nauru and Christmas Islands mines. As a result,
JPMC's potential additional demand, compared to 1985, will exceed 2.5 mtpy
by 1990; 4 mtpy by 1995, and 6 mtpy by 2000. Under this scenario, Jordan's
competitors would still be able to market their planne' phosphate rock
production (Annex 3-3). Under these projections, the marketing of the
additioaal 1.5 mtpy production of the proposed project is not anticipated
to present special difficulties or risks and will not disrupt the
international phosphate rock market. In an alternative "low case"
scenario, Jordan would concentrate on the more profitable Asian and Far
East markets, maintaining its share in most East European, Mediterranean,
and West European markets. Under this scenario, the additional demand
available to Jordan would be 2 mtpy in 1990, 3.7 mtpy in 1995 and 4.1 mtpy
in 2000.

3.19      Phosphate Fertilizer.  JPMC's sales of fertilizers are limited by
the chemical complex production capacity. The company has an aggressive
pricing policy, and has successfully marketed 580,000 tonnes of DAP and
30,000 tonnes of phosphoric acid in 1986 (Annex 3-6). In 1987, sales are
planned to at least reach 650,000 tonnes of DAP, and 20,000 tonnes of
Phosphoric Acid, and this target is likely to be achieved, based on sales
results for the first semester of 1987. JPMC phosphate fertilizer exports
represented about 7% of world phosphate trade. Its production capacity is
limited to 650,000 tonnes of DAP. On the other hand, world trade of
phosphate fertilizer is expected, according to IEC's projection, to
increase at about 3.4% p.a. over the 1986-2000 period. Therefore, JPMC 's
market share will gradually decline from 7% to 5.8% in 1995 and 4.9X in the
year 2000. The marketing of 650,000 tonnes of DAP per annun in the future
is not anticipated to create substantial problems to JPMC.
IV. THE PROJECT - SHIDIYA PHOSPHATE MINE
A. ProJect Objectives
4.01      The proposed project is a first step in the development of the
Shidiya phosphate deposit which within the next decade will become Jordan's
only productive mining area, as phosphate reserves at existing mines become
exhausted, and will provide a foundation for future expansions at Shidiya.
4.02      The Project's primary objective is to increase phosphate rock
production by 1.5 mtpy by 0989, thus increasing phosphate rock exports to a



-17-
level in excess of 7 stpy. Streamlining of existing mining and downstream
chemical fertilizer operations will be achieved through accelerated
research (paras. 4.25 and 4.26) and the improved viability of the
restructured phosphate sector will be secured. Dust control technology
will be upgraded at Aqaba port to internationally acceptable environmental
standards (paras. 4.22-4.23). The project's technical assistance component
will, inter alia, assist JPMC to define the appropriate scope and economic
configuration of future mine and beneficiation development phases at
Shidiya to ensure optimal sector development (para. 4.26).
B. Phasing of Mine Development and Sector Strategy
4.03      Through research and physical investigation that will be
undertaken as an integral part of the Project (para. 4.26), the economics
of expanding production at Shidiya to 3.0 mtpy under a second stage
development at the project area will be identified. The implementation of
future developments would lift exports to a level of 8.0 mtpy in 1994.
Beyond 1991, the production level of 6.7 mtpy from El Hassa/El Abiad cannot
be maintained due to limited economically recoverable reserves and
production from El Abiad will probably cease in 1992 and from El Hassa in
1997. The phosphate rock sector strategy, of which the proposed project is
a foundation, will compensate for the progressive loss of production from
El Hassa and El Abiad mines by the implementation of further production
areas in the Western and Eastern Shidiya deposits and will phase these
developments in such a manner as to maintain the export level of 7.1 stpy
to 1992 and to increase the export level to 8.0 mtpy in 1994 and maintain
that level through the year 2000. This strategy is presented in tabular
form in Annex 4-1.
C. Prolect DescriRtion
4.04      The principal features of the proposed project are:
(i)   procurement and commissioning of equipment to develop an open-pit
mine with a production design capacity of 1.5 mtpy consisting of:
two 20 m3 draglines, six 5.5-7.0 mJ hydraulic excavators,
twenty-two 50T dump trucks, four 5.3 i3 loaders, four bulldozers,
two graders, eight blasthole drills;
(ii)   procurement and installation of equipment for a dry beneficiation
plant consisting of screening, storage and handling facilities;
(iii)   construction of supporting infrastructure including an access
road, power facilities, water supply, workshops, warehouses and
offices to serve the mine and plant;
(iv)   construction of a mine townsite with necessary utilities;
(v)   technical assistance including overseas study tours and seminars
relating to (a) phosphate dust and slimes recovery;
(b) beneficiation research and technology; and (c) accounting,
finance and corporate planning; and



-18-
(vi)   procurement and installation of dust ext.actors/collectors and
monitoring devices at Aqaba port, and at the mines.
D.   Detailed Features
1. Mine Development
4.05      Location. The Shidiya deposit is located in the south of Jordan,
approximately 50 kms south-east of the city of Ma'an and 120 kms north-east
of the port of Aqaba (Map IBRD 19920), the export outlet for Jordan's
phosphate concentrates are exported and through which project rock will be
exported. The terrain is flat at about 900 m above sea level being part of
the Shidlya Plateau and is separated from the sea (Aqaba Gulf) by a
mountain range rising above 1,500 m. The project site is abouc 20 kms east
of the road leading from ma'an to Mudawwarah (adjacent to the Saudi Arabia
border) and about 25 kms east of the existing narrow gauge railway which is
used for transporting part of the production from the existing El Hassa/El
Abiad phosphate mines to the port of Aqaba (para. 5.01). The Jordan
climate is semi-arid with average daily temperatures of 33C, May through
October, and 12C, November through April. The climate is typical of
desert conditions in the region with low annual rainfall (average 50mm) but
with occasional heavy showers reaching 50mm per hour. Humidity is normally
low. The project area and its environs are uninhabitated and free of
vegetation and water courses.
4.06      Geology. Reserves and Ore Quality.  The geology of the Shidiya
area was first investigated in 1969-74 by the National Resources
Authority. Detailed drilling by JPMC over the period 1975-86 identified
contiguous phosphate bearing areas and a total geological ore reserve in
excess of 1 billion tonnes of phosphate.

Ongoing exploration will probably increase these reserves substantially
particularly in the Eastern and South/East areas.
4.07      Exploration has been concentrated in the Western Ore Body, which
is considered geologically and economically most amenrible to mining. The
optimal project area for production of 1.5 mtpy phosphate rock for a
minimum 20 years has been defined as an area of approximately 16.2 sq kis
within the Western Ore Body and contains 237.4 mt in-situ phosphate ore
reserves i.e., 32% of the Western Ore Body and 17.5% of the overall Shidiya
reserves (as identified at January 1987).



-19-
4.08      A generalized vertical geological cross-sectlon of strata in the
project area is presented in Annex 4-2. Four beds of phosphate, AO, Al, A2
and A3 exist at individual average thicknesses varying from 0.8 to 1.9m to
a maximum depth of approximately 20 meters. The beds dip very gently to
the north. The main phosphate sequence (beds Al, A2 and A3) is overlain by
alluvium, marl and coquina limestone, averaging a total of 13.4 m thickness
(including AO bed). The phosphate beds Al, A2 and A3 are separated by
interwastes. The inZ itV vertical ratio of overburden and interwaste to
phosphate ore is 3:lm Ira
4.09      Mine Development.  Feasibility study work undertaken by a French
consulting consortium led by Sofreatnes and subsequent feasibility work
carried out by JPMC has shown that bed A2 can be marketed as 73/75 grade
after simple and low cost "dry" screening, whereas the other phosphate beds
(AO, Al and A3) will require "wet" beneficiation (washing and/or flotation)
and drying to produce commercially marketable products of similar grade.
The economics of recovering the lower grade phosphate (AO, Al and A3) beds
by "wet" beneficiation, bearing in mind the low (37-43%) level of TCP
recovery mainly attributable to the large screening (oversize) losses
(tabulated below) requires further investigation, which has been initiated
by JPMC.

4.10      The Project entails the mining and dry screening of bed A2 only
to produce 1.5 mtpy (73-75 TCP) rock product.  Reserves are adequate for a
mine life of 20 years. Overburden removal per year ranges up to 11.0-11.5
million BCM.
4.11      Feasibility work has determined that the geometry of the 16.2
sq.km project area is simple, being typified by uniformly shallow
overburden and relatively flat phosphate beds. This makes overburden
removal suitable for dragline operation, one of the lowest cost mine
excavation methods available. Optimal dragline configuration will include
two units with a 75 m boom and 24 m3 bucket with an effective excavation
capacity of 12 million BCM per year. Dragline excavation down to the top
of bed Al will include rejection of bed AO to waste. Beds Al and
underlying interwaste and phosphate beds will be removed by a shovel/truck
system.  This would consist of six 5.5-7.0 m  hydraulic e cavators and a
fleet of twenty-two 50T trucks complemented by four 5.3 a loaders. Other
equipment such as bulldozers, graders, water trucks and maintenance trucks
will support the main mining equipment. Beds Al and A3 will be stockpiled



-20-
until the economics of beneficiation of such lower grade beds has been
established. Research is underway and should be completed in 1988 to allow
definition of the economics of a second stage development of Shidiya which
could encompass beneficiation of AO, Al and A3.
4.12      The 'box cut" area to open up the mine will form a central
north-south corridor through the center of the project area and will be 4.4
kus in length, 175 m wide and 20 m deep, to intersect all phosphate beds.
This facilitates optimal pit bottom development to accommodate truck
loading, dragline waste piles and a central paved haul-road. Total "box
cut" excavation is approximately 20 million BCM and will be undertaken by
JPMC truck-shovel equipment from existing mines until mid-1988 when project
mobile equipment is commissioned. Following commissioning of draglines in
mid-1989, the project area will be mined on a quadrant basis to produce a
uniform rock product quality.
2. Beneficiation Plant
4.13      The proposed millsite (baneficiation plant) will be located
immediately west of the project mining area. Run-of-mine phosphate ore
will be transported an average 3.5 kms out of the open-pit by 50 T truck to
a vibrating screening plant (600 tph capacity) to separate high grade -12mm
undersize (73.7X TCP) from +12mm oversize (49.2% TCP). Oversize will be
discarded and transported to waste dumps by 50 T truck. Undersize will be
transported by 50 T trucks to a stockpile and/or to load out (500 T) bins
at a truck loading terminal. The truck loading terminal will be built as a
steel structure with 3x500 t capacity bins equipped with truck loading
chutes (450 tph capacity per chute). A 70,000 T open storage facility with
concrete floor and retaining walls will provide a 15 day inventory of
finished product at the mine site area. Phosphate rock production is
expected to be 0.8 mt in 1988 and 1.5 mtpy in 1989 and thereafter.
3. Infrastructure Development
4.14      Road.  The project area will be connected to the Ma'an-Saudi
Arabia highway, 30 kms from the mine area, by a mine access road.
Construction of the access road is underway and is scheduled to be
completed by the end of 1988. JPMC will contract trucks to transport
phosphate from Shidiya to Aqaba, due to rail capacity limitations (para
5.01). Agreement was reached, during negotiations, that the Government
will cause the Ministry of Public Works to complete construction of the
road by December 31, 1988.
4.15      Electricity Supply.  JEA is currently installing, a 70 km, 132 kv
double circuit transmission line to Shidiya and will modify the main
substation at Ma'an and construct a 132/33/11 kv substation adjacent to the
beneficiation plant at Shidiya. Construction is expected to be completed
by the end of 1988. Tha cost of this work will be borne equally between
JEA/JPMC. Agreement was reached, during negotiations, that the Government
will cause JKA to finance its share of these costs and to carry out the
construction of the transmission line and substation by December 31, 1988.
Internal power distribution facilities (8x33kv feeder lines,



-21-
switchgear and control/monitoring facilities) will connect the Shidiya
sub-station to the draglines, beneficiation olant, townsite and workshops.
4.16      Water SUpPlY. The total water requirement of the project is
estimated at 20m /hr for industrial and domestic use. Three production
wells have been drilled by JPMC, 20-25 kms north of the project area,
intersecting the main regional aquifer i Ientified during feasibility work.
The wells have an average yield of 100 a /hr eacn and are already being
utilized in a limited manner for the existing m'.ne camp.  Two of the wells
will be utilized for the project. An elevated storage reservoir will be
constructed near the beneficiation plant and townsite. Water analyses
performed by the National Resource Authority have indicated that the water
is in general acceptable for all purposes, but JPMC will treat water for
domestic use in accordance with World Health Organization standards.
Agreement was reached during negotiations, that a condition of loan
effectiveness will be that the Government has transferred all necessary
water and land rights for water production wells and water lines to JPMC.
4.17      Townsite.  The proposed townsite comrises 252 housing units, 132
of 61 m2 living area (type A2) and 120 of 89 m  living area (type A3).  The
location is immediately west of the proposed millsite to facilitate
immediate access to the project area. The townsite area includes
restaurants, a shopping center, healtn clinic, mosque, guest house (350 m2)
and two managers' houses (150 m2 each). Type A3 houses are two bedrooms
(with kitchenette, bathroom and sitting room) and would house four
bachelors and type A2 is essentially the same unit but one bedroom to
accommodate two bachelors. In the interests of economy, the layout has
been adjusted, following Bank recommendations, to better fit an overall
longer-term development plan, to reduce land use for roads, parking areas,
and to minimize cost of townsite infrastructure (electricity and sewage).
4. Manpower
4.18      The manpower requirement of the project at design capacity of 1.5
mtpy phosphate rock product will be 750. Full details of the organization
structure for project implementation and construction and job
categories/personnel required are shown in Annex 4-3. Substantial
on-the-job training is already in hand at the existing El Hassa/El Abiad
mines to prepare for skilled/semi-skilled requirements of the Shidiya
project starting 1988. Graduates from existing training schools and poly-
technics will also be utilized as trainees in the new project. Additional
management staff have been introduced at the existing mines in recent years
to prepare for transfer to the project at start-up. In addition, JPMC has
developed a computer listing of more than 1,000 qualified machine operators
and electrical/mechanical personnel, many of whom have recently returned to
Jordan from Gulf States, and all of whom have expressed interest in gaining
employment in the expanding Company. The technology to be used in the mine
and beneficiation plant at Shidiya is very similar to that traditionally
found in existing JPMC mines and as a consequence, no new training or
recruitment practices need to be instituted.



-22-
5. IScolox
4.19      Shidiva Mine Site.  No serious environmental hazards will result
from the mine development. The Shidiya deposit is located in a barren
desert region which is devoid of population, vegetation and water courses.
Ths project area occupies only 16.2 sq.km in the Rabe-El-Hali (the Empty
Quarter) which extends into the Saudi Arabia desert covering many thousand
square kilometers. The area is traversed periodically by nomadic tribes
and their sheep herds and project development will provide a source of
water and supplies to tribes people and a source of possible employment.
Wildlife in the project area is almost non-existent. In the environs of
the project area, occasional rabbits have been sited and falcons are known
to fly over the general area during annual migration. Dust will be
generated, as in any open-pit mining operation during excavation and in-pit
dumping by dragline but much of the airborne dust will be contained below
groutI level and within the excavation area and its immediate environs.
Major dust generation resulting from truck haulage out of pit will be
contained by repeated water spraying. Dust emission at the screening plant
will be collected in dry cyclones which will be procured as a part of the
screening plant equipment.
4.20      Aqaba Port.  Emissions of phosphate dust at the phosphate
receiving, storage and loading facilities at Aqaba (paras. 5.05-5.09) are
at serious levels and are environmentally unacceptable. Phosphate rock is
crushed, beneficiated and dried at the existing mines and arrives at the
port in a dry and dusty condition with a high content of fines.
Opportunity exists for thc.. generation of airborne phosphate dust and a
considerable quanitity of dust is released during the loading/unloading
cycles. The Government and concerned authorities have indicated a total
commitment to the resolution of this issue.
4.21      The relatively high portion of phosphate fines handled at Aqaba
port and that becomes airborne, is not only a serious environmental issue,
but also represents a commercial loss to JPMC. Collection of substantial
amounts of phosphate fines at the port by additional dust collection
devices would present a disposal problem. If such material were loaded
onto ships for export, the environmental problem would simply be
transferred to JPMC's customers at the point of unloading and would create
technological problems at the processing end. Disposal of substantial
amounts of the fine phosphate inland from the port would present
logistical, economic and environmental problems.
4.22      Recognizing these issues and particularly the environmental
problem at Aqaba and its environs, JPMC have initiated a program to
'dedust' the phosphate at all mines and to confirm the feasibility of
utilizing the phosphate fines in its chemical plant at Wadi II. This
program has two essential advantages: (i) phosphate fine material would be
collected at the mines thus substantially reducing the fine content of rock
arriving at the port and substantially reducing dust pollution; and



-23-
(ii) the high grade phosphate currently fed to the chemical plant would be
freed for export, thus improving the financial position of JPMC and
increasing the industry's economic yield. The program has a series of
phases. Firstly, JPMC has recently completed development of a pilot plant
facility at its research center at Ruseifa (para 2.18) to fully assess the
utilization of fines in the chemical plant. This testing was started
December 1987, and is scheduled to be completed by March 30, 1988.
Following this work, industrial tests will be undertaken at the chemical
plant starting April 30, 1988, and will be completed by August 30, 1988.
Dust removal technology, the introduction of which was started at dryers at
existing mines in September 1986, will be completed, including
installations at the Shidiya project site, by September 30, 1989. The
final phase of the program starting October 1989, will tnvolve the
introduction of plants to remove phosphate slimes at exiating mines and in
parallel, detail engineering and implementation of modifications at the
chemical plant. Start-up of full dedusting/desliming and utilization of
fine phosphate at the chemical plant is scheduled for late 1990.
4.23      Prior to negotiations, the Bank gave its full support to the
above program, recognizing that not only would it lead to a more optimal
economic configuration of the phosphate industry in Jordan, but also that
it would lead to a considerable reduction in dust pollution, thus
addressing the serious environmental issue. However, the implementation of
the program will not be completed until late 1990 and, in addition, JPMC
appreciate that phosphate, being a friable material, will break down during
loading/unloading, thus necessitating eventual upgrading of dedusting
equipment within the port area. As a consequence and to better address the
environmental issue in the short-term, agreement was reached during
negotiations that JPMC will (i) immediately initiate monitoring of
phosphate dust emission at Aqaba; (ii) submit to the Bank for review and
comment, a report on monitoring activities by August 31, 1988; (iii)
provide to the Bank for review and comment, preliminary specifications for
dust removal equipment to be installed at the port by August 31, 1988; (iv)
take all action required to ensure that phosphate loading/unloading
operations are conducted with due regard to public health and the
preservation of the environment, and reduce dust emissions to
environmentally acceptable levels (annual geometric mean less than 70
micrograms/m n above local background level and maximum 24 hourly
concentration less than 5 x annual geometric mean of local background dust
level) by December 31, 1990; and (v) promptly allocate all appropriate
funds as required to acquire and install at Aqaba, equipment for dust
pollution and extraction to maintain the standards at (iv) above.
Procurement of the dust removal equipment will commence not later than
December 31, 1988, and will be installed not later than June 30, 1989. The
collection, separation, transportation and disposal of dust fines will be
undertaken in a manner satisfactory to the Bank.



-24-
6. Technical Assistance
4.24      JPMC has extensive experience in construction management and
implementation, including well established scheduling, monitoring and cost
control procedures. The technical assistance component of the project is
limited to individuals and small groups of consultants that JPHC will hire
to (i) help orientate physical research relating to fines and slimes
recovery and their potential utilization at the fertilizer plant at Aqaba
and to upgrade beneficiation technology; and (ii) upgrade corporate
planning, finance, and internal audit functions. In addition to hiring
consultants, overseas study tours and seminars in Jordan will be included
in the technical assistance program. Agreement was reached with JPMC,
during negotiations, that plans for technical assistance will be prepared
and submitted to the Bank by end-PY88 and that hiring consultants will
commence by mid-FY89.
4.25      Dust and Slimes Recovery and Utilization.  Rock drying facilities
at existing mines and associated beneficiation plants produce substantial
quantities of dust and slimes, respectively, which are currently discarded
as nonrecoverable waste products. JPMC recognizes that dust/slimes
recovery could improve the export quality of phosphate rock, produce
additional export grade rock and could provide a potential feed to the
fertilizer plant at Aqaba, freeing higher grade rock for export. Extensive
testing and research are planned by JPHC, who recognizes the need for
technical assistance to help orientate, implement and analyze the work
program. The foreign cost of this component of the technical assistance
program is estimated at US$106,000 for 4 man-months @ US$14,000 per
man-month plus US$ 20,000 for travel and subsistence, US$30,000 for pilot
plant test equipment rental and overseas sample shipment and testing.
4.26      Beneficiation.  JPMC recognizes that development of Shidiya
beyond a production level of 1.5 mtpy, (following simple dry treatment),
will involve the construction and operation of high cost "wet" beneficia-
tion processes (flotation) under a second stage development phase. JPMC
has no commercial experience with flotation technology. Feasibility study
work has identified the need for further research to optimize the proposed
beneficiation processes and to maximize the economic benefits that could
accrue under a possible second stage mine development. Of particular
concern, following laboratory work undertaken to date, are the relatively
low beneficiation plant TCP recoveries (as low as 37 - 43%) resulting from
high (34-50%) losses resulting from screening oversize. JPMC recognizes
that substantial economic gain would result from increased TCP recovery and
that extensive research in this area has been undertaken worldwide,
particularly in China and in the USA. The Project will provide consultants
to assist JPMC to orientate and implement an appropriate research program
and will provide for key JPMC staff, responsible for beneficiation, process
design and research, to visit China, the USA, and other countries, to
familiarize themselves with beneficiation research and with worldwide
state-of-the-art beneficiation. Overseas visits will be supplemented by
seminars in Jordan by foreign experts. The foreign cost of this technical



-25-
assistance is estimated at US$134,000 for 5 man-months @ US$14,000 per
month plus US$20,000 for travel and subsistence and US$44,000 for JPMC
staff overseas travel and subsistence (2 trips for 4 people).
4.27      Corporate Planning, Finance and Internal Audit.  JPMC mine and
corporate planning and its internal auditing functions have been
handicapped by a shortage of higher level staff with sufficient knowledge
of corporate planning, finance and investment evaluation methodology. In
order to permit the establishment of effective corporate planning and
internal audit units, selected technical staff will be assisted by a
consultant to develop long-range mine plans over a 10-year horizon and
selected Finance Department staff will receive training in financial
analysis, financial planning and project cost - benefit analysis. In order
to ensure suitable and practical training of financial staff, the proposed
training program will comprise mainly "workshops' and 'on-the-job'
training, whereby the trainees will work within their organization on
practical problems, under the supervision and with the assistance of
visiting foreign experts, who will supervise the team work and
prepare/review their work program and progress. The Project will finance
the foreign cost of the experts, including travel and subsistence. The
foreign cost of this technical assistance component is estimated at
US$146,000 for 9 man-months (4-5 sessions of 2 months for one expert), at
US$14,000 per month, plus US$20,000 for travel expenses.
7. Project Costs
4.28      The estimated financing required for the Project is US$89.0
million (JD 29.47 million), including physical and price contingencies,
working capital and interest during construction, as summarized below. The
base cost estimate is in September 1987 prices. Physical contingencies are
calculated at 5% for local costs and 10% for foreign costs reflecting
JPMC's extensive recent experience with local contracting and the lower
level of certainty regarding offshore equipment costs. Price escalation
has been based on the phasing of commitments and expenditures consistent
with the time schedule for implementing the project, and projected local
and international inflation rates, assuming that US dollar exchange rate
adjustment will on average maintain purchasing power parity. A domestic
inflation rate of 3.0% per annum has been applied throughout the project
life. International inflation rates are projected at 3.0% for 1987, 1.0%
for 1988-90 and 3.5% for 1991 and thereafter.

4.29       Cost estimates are based on JPMC's cost experience in procuring
similar equipment and works during recent years, updated to September
1987. The estimated working capital requirements are based on initial
prestripping at the mine representing 3 months of operating costs,
additional product inventory at the mine representing 14 days of sales, one
month of working expenses (consumables, salaries), two months of sales in
commercial receivables, and 25 days of sales in commercial accounts
payables. The estimate is based on JPMC's actual (1986) working capital
structure. Technical assistance cost estimates are on the bases described
in paras. 4.25-4.27.
4.30       The total capital cost for the project, including physical
contingencies but excluding price escalation, working capital and interest
during construction is US$45 per tonne annual output of phosphate rock,
which is in line with current cost estimates of typical developing



-27-
countries' open-pit mine development experience worldwide. The project
includes procurement of most mining equipment and a substantial portion of
civil works and infrastructure that would be required to increase
production from 1.5 to 3.0 mtpy during a possible second stage
development. The Project can, therefore, be considered competitive with
worldwide open-pit mining unit investment costs.
8. Financing Plan
4.31      The financing plan for the project is shown below.  Total
financing required is US$89.0 million of which US$65.6 million or 74Z
constitutes the direct foreign exchange component. The proposed Bank
loan of US$31 million represents 47Z of the foreign exchange component and
35% of the total project cost.

4.32      The proposed Bank loan would be made to JPMC at the standard IBRD
variable interest rate and on country terms, i.e., a 17-year term including
a 4 year grace period. The Government of Jordan would guarantee the loan.
JPMC would pay to the Government annually, a guarantee fee equivalent to
10% of the Bank interest rate on the outstanding loan balance. JPMC would
bear the foreign exchange and variable interest risk.
4.33      JPMC would finance all civil works and the majority of
infrastructure costs. The Bank loan would finance foreign exchange costs
of mining and millsite equipment, infrastructure (power distribution
equipment) and technical assistance. JPMC may utilize US$15-20 million
export credit financing for mine equipment. In this event, part of the
Bank loan could be used to finance down payments not financed by export



-28-
credit agencies.  The risk of a shortfall of funds from export financing
agencies is considered to be small.
9. Procurement and Disbursement
4.34      Procurement. JPMC has traditionally procured equipment through
ICB and is familiar with the Bank's procurement guidelines and procedures
for goods and services. Although Bank proceeds will be utilized to finance
only a portion of goods to be procured, all offshore equipment will be
procured by ICB following Bank guidelines. This will facilitate
identification of packages where the Bank would participate in joint
financing with export credit agencies. Bank participation would be to
finance downpayments (traditionally 15X of contract value) if required by
export credit agencies. Packages which are clearly suitable for Bank
financing (Annex 4-4) have been tentatively agreed with JPMC.
4.35      Contracts for a total estimated 8 offshore packages (US$28.5
million - list of wain Iteam are given in Annex 4-4) would be awarded
following ICB. Packages not exceeding US$350,000 each and up to an
aggregate value of US$2.5 aillion will be procured by LIB from at least 4
suppliers and at least 3 different countries. All ICB packages and the
first 3 LIB packages to be issued, regardless of value, will be subject to
prior review by the Bank. This constitutes over 95% of the value of all
goods financed out of the loan, the balance being subject to post review.
All Bank financed consulting and technical assistance services will be
procured in accordance with Bank guidelines.
4.36      Details of procurement of goods and services are shown in the
table on the following page.

assistance component. Disbursements would be made against full
documentation except for technical assistance components and any other
contracts not exceeding US$100,000 for which disbursement would be made
against statement of expenditures (SOE) procedure. JPMC would retain the
necessary back-up documentation. To facilitate disbursement, a revolving
fund Still be established In a bank acceptable to the Bank with an initial
deposit of US$2.0 million to cover the estimated average expenditures of
about 4 months. The estimated disbursement figures are shown in Annex 4-5,
together with comparison with Regional industry project profiles and
Bankwide mining projects. The estimated disbursement proflle is in line
with both Bankwide mining projects and regional industrial projects. The
Bank loan is expected to be fully disbursed by December 31, 1993, and the
loan closing date shall be June 30, 1994.

10.  Project Management and Implementation
4.38      Project organization.  Project engineering and design is being
carried out by JPMC's Production, Projects, and Technical Affairs
Departments. Procurement is being handled by the JPMC Supply Department
which handles procurement for all goods and services for JPMC. A qualified
engineer with many years experience with JPMC has been appointed Shidiya
Project Director. The Project Director will report to a JPMC Steering
Committee comprising the Deputy Managing and other Directors (Technical,
Production, Finance, Supplies) of the Company. The Project Director is
assisted by an Advisory Group which has been formed to perform detailed
engineering tasks (geology, mining, beneficiation, infrastructure design),
assisted as necessary by locally hired consultants. This Group comprises
senior engineers from JPMC headquarters staff and from existing mines.
Arrangements for project implementation are satisfactory.
4.39      The full organization chart for construction, including
headquarters staff is given in Annex 4-3. A total of 261 personnel will be
Involved in construction at the project site. Following the start of
procurement activities a Shidiya project manager will be appointed at the
mine site together with deputies in charge of mining, civil, mechanical,
electrical, surveying and administrative divisions. The project management
team will reside at the site and will be fully supported by a technical,
skilled, semi-skilled and unskilled workforce. The JPMC Shidiya project
staff will be essentially decentralized. Erection of plant and equipment
will be performed by JPMC erection crews at site directed by representa-
tives of the suppliers. Portions of civil works (townsite) and complex
erection (draglines) will be undertaken by local contractors on a turnkey
basis.
4.40      Prolect Status.  The Project has been approved by the Ministry of
Planning and is an integral part of the Government's 5-year plan. JPMC is
proceeding with completion of detailed engineering and has initiated
procurement activities with Bank approval. A general procurement notice
for the project work was issued on April 16, 1987, and bid documents for
main equipment items were issued on September 30 and October 31, 1987.
4.41      Implementation Schedule.  JPMC's managerial and technical staff
completed project preparation (feasibility study and preliminary engineer-
ing) in January 1987, and are continuing with detailed engineering.
Agreement on a realistic project implementation schedule was reached during
appraisal (Annex 4-6) and forms the basis for financial and economic
analysis. The necessary land required for the project is already allocated
to JPMC by the Government. Access road construction is being financed and
supervised by the Ministry of Public Works. The JEA opened tenders in
March 1987 for turnkey construction of power supply to the project site and
construction is planned to be completed by October 1988. Procurement of
main mining and beneficiation plant equipment has been initiated by JPMC
since September 30, 1987. Commissioning of mobile mining equipment will be
completed by June 1988, to facilitate development of a mine "opening cut";

and phosphate rock production will commence In July 1988.  Physical project
completion is expected by early 1990.
V. TRANSPORT AND PORT INFRASTRUCTURE
A. Land Transport Arrangements
5.01      Phosphate rock is currently transported to Aqaba from existing
mines at E1 Hassa and El Abiad by both rail and truck. Essentially
trucking is utilized to the extent that railway capacity is not available
at present to transport all phosphate produced. Recent statistics for
transport of phosphate to Aqaba are summarized below:

Source: JPMC.
5.02      Transport of phosphate by rail is somewhat erratic in terms of
monthly throughput, due primarily to the poor condition of the existing
narrow gauge rail line and occasional derailments due to poor track
maintenance. The percentage of phosphate carried by rail has declined in
recent years. The decline in rail capacity has not been a pressing concern
to JPMC as present truck tariffs at JD 1.7-1.8 (US$ 5,50-5.80) per tonne
are more attractive than rail tariffs (US$7.00 per tonne--Chapter 7 and
Annex 7-1).
5.03      Under the Bank's Multi-Node Transport Project (Loan 2463-JO),
track renewal on critical rail sections between existing mines and Aqaba,
rehabilitation of locomotives, improvement of maintenance facilities, and
technical assistance and training to the Aqaba Railway Corporation (ARC),
will enable ARC to carry up to 4.5 mtpy phosphate by 1988. The proposed
Transport III project may envisage the extension of the railway line to
Shidiya, depending on the economic and financial justification of this
extension. With projected annual production from existing mines of 6.7
mtpy from 1987, JPMC will still maintain truck contract arrangements to
transport up to 2.5 mtpy of phosphate rock.
5.04      As far as the project is concerned, with ARC being unable to
transport all phosphate produced at existing mines (which are further from
Aqaba than Shidiya), JPMC will contract with truck companies to carry the
1.5 mtpy project production from Shidiya to Aqaba. Bids for this contract



-32-
will be issued by JPMC in late 1987. With sufficient trucking capacity in
Jordan, there will be no difficulty in finding responsive bidders. Indeed,
with the proposed longer term truck contract envisaged by JPMC, unit rates
will probably be in the order of US$5.0 per tonne.
B.   Aqaba Port
5.05      The Port of Aqaba was established in 1952 and is operated by the
Aqaba Port Corporation (TPC), an independent public corporation. The port
includes seven general cargo main berths, two shallower cargo berths, two
lighter berths, and two phosphate loading berths. Two rail intake and six
road intake unloading facilities are available for receiving phosphate and
six sheds are available for phosphate storage (see Map IBRD 19921).
5.06      Rail intakes have a capacity to handle 7.5 mtpy phosphate, which
far exceeds the capacity (currently in the 1.5-3.0 mtpy range and likely to
reach 4.5 mtpy In 1988 following present rail rehabilitation of the
incoming rail line). Road Intakes can handle 5.0 mtpy phosphate. Thus the
phosphate receiving facilities could handle 9.5 mtpy phosphate, compared to
8.2 mtpy after completion of the project.
5.07      Phosphate can be loaded by two berths "A" and "B".  Berth "B" is
180 meters long with 15 m depth alongside and can accommodate 100,000 dwt
vessels. There are two shiploaders on the berth each of 2,100 t/hr
capacity served by conveyors from four phosphate storage sheds (3,4,5 and
6). Berth "A" can accommodate vessels up to 25,000 dwt and is provided
with a non-slewing conveyor rated at 1,000 t/hr. Berth "A" is not
currently required for phosphate loading and is used for other cargo
purposes. The loader on the berth can be fed from storage sheds 1 and 2 or
alternatively by conveyor from sheds 4 through 6.
5.08      Berth "A" can load 1.7 mtpy and Berth "B", 7.8 mtpy phosphate, a
total of 9.4 mtpy. Although this exceeds the projected export levels after
completion of the project, some excess capacity is required in view of
seasonal variation in demand and variation in dispatching by customers of
vessels to Aqaba for loading.
5.09      Six sheds with a total capacity of 341,000 t are available for
storing phosphate at Aqaba. Throughout 1986, the sheds were maintained at
close to full capacity by effective communication between phosphate mines
management and JPMC port representatives at Aqaba. With the flexibility of
the installation, the excess intake capacity at the road/rail intakes, and
present railway rehabilitation work, the storage facilities are considered
adequate for the increased levels of export after project completion.
5.10      Port handling tariffs paid to TPC by JPMC are governed by
Ministerial Decree. Tariffs are set on a sliding scale with a 600 fils
(US$1.92) per tonne tariff in excess of 2 mtpy throughput. This tariff is
considered reasonable and has been used in the financial analysis of the
project.

VI. FINANCIAL ANALYSIS
A. Past and Present Financial Performance
6.01            Over the 1982-85 period, JPMC followed a prudent financial policy
with effective cost control and conservative investment and borrowing. Its
profitability (JD 16.1 million in 1985), borrowing (long-term debt/equity
ratio of 26/74), repayment capacity (debt service ratio of 3.5), and cash
situation (JD 3.1 million cash available) were satisfactory until 1985
(Annex 6.1). However, 1986 was a turning point for JPMC: declining world
phosphate prices started to reduce its profitability, and the absorption of
the fertilizer plant (formerly JFI) placed a heavy financial burden on JPMC
with an additional debt service of JD 2.8 million and a net cash cost of JD
5.7 million. The 1985-86 depreciation of the US dollar against the
Jordanian Dinar also reduced JPMC's profitability, as phosphate rock and
fertilizer prices are denominated in US dollars on the world market.
However, JPMC still made a consolidated net benefit of JD 1.0 million, but
its cash situation has become tight and its bank overdraft reached JD 15.4
million.

6.02      Cash Generation and ProfitabilitY (-1982-85).  Over the 1982-85
period, JPMC's cash generation increased rapidly from JD 15.7 million (25X
of revenue) to JD 25.1 million (30% of revenue). Net profit also improved
sharply from JD 5.2 million in 1982 (8.4X of revenue) to JD 16.6 million in
1985 (19.9X of revenue), due to:
(i) a substantial production increase from 4.4 to 6.2 mtpy;
(ii)  a shift in sales structure in favor of higher grade rock;
(III) the appreciation of US dollar against the Jordanian Dinar over
the 1982-85 period; and
(iv)  an effective production cost control, which reduced mining
production cost per tonne from JD 10.17 in 1982 to JD 9.39 in
1985 (Annex 6-2).
Simultaneously, the company's prudent investment and borrowing policy kept
interest on the long-term debt constant in nominal terms, and annual
depreciation at a low level.
6.03      Investment and indebtedness (1982-85).  JPMC's annual capital
Investment ranged from JD 4.3 to 7.3 million. Moderate long-term borrowing
raised the debt/equity ratio from 28/72 in 1982 to a still conservative
33/67 in 1985. JPMC's cash flow after debt service, taxes and dividends
was sufficient to cover JD 6 million of working capital requirements, but
only 14Z of investment.
6.04      Working Capital Management..  During the same 1982-85 period, the
company managed to reimburse JD 7.9 million of 1982 outstanding short-term
debts and to increase cash reserves up to JD 3.1 million in 1985. Less
positive was the increase in receivables (those due from the Government
reached JD 10.3 million). However, the company's current liquidity ratio
improved from 1.69 in 1982 to 2.13 in 1985.
6.05      The 1986 Restructuring.  The total cash cost of the JFI
acquisition, including the Fertilizer Unit's 1986 debt service, was about
JD 34 million. This was covered up to JD 6 million by an increase of the
Fertilizer Unit's bank overdraft, and for JD 28 million by the Mining
Unit. In the Mining Unit, these funds came from (i) the Mining Unit's cash
flow for JD 2 million; (ii) a reduction in cash available for JD 3 million;
(iii) a bank overdraft increase for JD 9 million; (iv) new long-term debts
for JD 2 million; and (v) the sale of JPMC's financial participation In
various corporations for JD 12 million. The overall cash impact on JPMC's
liquidity was minus JD 18 million.
6.06      At the time of the merger, the Fertilizer Unit's sales barely
covered its cash production costs. Its cash generation was only minus JD
72 thousand, mainly because of the low sales price of DAP, and the high
price of sulphur and ammonia, which represented 34% and 14% of cash pro-
duction costs, respectively. Taking into account the annual depreciation
(JD 2.8 million) and the interest on the debt (JD 2.7 million ), the



-35-
Fertilizer Unit's loss was JD 5.5 million, and its corresponding cash
deficit after debt service was Jt 2.9 million.
6.07      In the Mining Unit, 1986 was not as good as 1985, because of the
declining phosphate rock prices (minus US$3 per tonne), and the devaluation
of the US dollar compared to the Jordanian Dinar by about 10%. Despite
increasing sales, revenues declined from JD 82.8 million to JD 76.2
million. On the other hand, total cash operating costs increased although
moderately, by 6.2%, from JD 57.6 million to JD 61.2 million. The
resulting Mining Unit's cash generation plunged from JD 25.1 million in
1985 to JD 14.9 million in 1986. With stable depreciation and Interest on
the debt, the Mining Unit's net result before taxes was JD 6.5 million,
some JD 10 million below its 1985 level. In cash terms, the Mining Unit's
cash flow after debt service was reduced to JD 8.2 million, compared to JD
17.9 million in 1985. However, In the absence of the acquisition of JFI,
1986 would have been an acceptable year: the net result before taxes was
8.5% of revenue, and the Mining Unit's cash situation would have been
Improved by JD 8 million, raising the Mining Unit's cash available to JD 11
million.
6.08      Hence, as of end-1986, the Mining Unit was still financially
strong, with a good borrowing and repayment capacity; the Fertilizer Unit
was just covering its cash cost and was relying on the Mining Unit's strong
cash generation to service its debt and finance its working capital. The
overall company emerged from the 1986 restructuring with a weakened cash
position (total overdraft JD 15.4 million), but still a safe 1.55 debt
service ratiot a conservative 42/58 debt/equity ratio, and an acceptable
1.33 liquidity ratio.
B. Financial ProJections
6.09      Financial projections for the 1986-98 period have been prepared
for the Mining Unit (Annex 6-3) and the Fertilizer Unit (Annex 6-4)
separately, in order to assess each unit's profitability, and for JPMC as a
whole, to ascertain the Company's long-term financial viability. The basis
for these projections are: (i) conservative projections for world
phosphate rock, fertilizer and fertilizer input prices (para. 3.12 and
Annex 6-5); (ii) JPMC long-run sales program with exports limited to 7.1 mt
in 1990 and 8.0 mt in 1995 (Annexes 4-1 and 6-6); (iii) El Abiad and El
Hassa miniag plans based on the probable depletion of their reserves by
1992 and 1997 (Annex 6-7); (iv) the development of the Shidiya area beyond
the proposed project with the staged implementation of Shidiya II and
Shidiya III projectst to gradually replace the old mines (Annex 4-1); and
(v) unit production costs as calculated in Annex 6-2. All projections are
in current Jordanian Dinars. Inflation rates used in the calculation are
3% p.a. for local inflation. For international inflation, the annual rates
are 1987: 3%; 1988-90: 1%; 1991 and after: 3.5%. A sensitivity analysis
was carried out to estimate JPMC's financial survival capacity under lower
phosphate rock and fertilizer prices. The conclusion is that the Company
can sustain 10% lower prices without running into financial difficulties.



-36-
1. Mining Unit
6.10          The Mining Unit's financial performance  is expected to be
satisfactory and improve in the future, because of the low production cost
of future mines, and increasing mining efficiency, while world prices are
expected to increase moderately. Starting with a conservative financial
structure (Annex 6-l), the Mining Unit is not anticipated to meet
substantial cash problems, and will remain JPMC's moot profitable sector.
JPMC's pro-forma projected financial statements for the Mining Unit for the
1986-98 period are given in Annex 6-3.

6.11      Revenues.  Projected reventes are expected to increase from JD
74.1 million in 1987 up to JD 158.5 million In 1998 (6.5% p.a.), due to the
combined effects of (i) increasing sales volume (4.1X p.a.); (ii) rock
price increasing by an average 2.0X p.a. in nominal terms; (iii) a shift of
exports toward more profitable markets; and (iv) a shift towards higher
grade rock due to the depletion of the E1 Hassa and El Abiad mines.

6.12      Mining Costs and Cash Flow.  Mining costs are projected to
Increase by an average 4.9% p.a., which is a lower rate of increase than
the sales, because of (i) a shift toward low-cost dragline operation; (ii)
the replacement of contractor mining by less costly JPMC operation; and
(iii) the development of low-cost mines in the Shidiya area (Annex 6-2).
As a result, the Mining Unit's cash flow will increase from JD 14.9 million
in 1986 to JD 25.2 million in 1990 and JD 48.9 million in 1998, with a flat
spot in 1990-92, due to El Hassa/El Abiad rising costs.
6.13     Investment Plan.  All JPMC's mining sector investments (Annex 6-8)
are technically and economically justified, based on an optimal mining plan
for El Hassa and El Abiad, and a staged development for the Shidiya mining
area in order to maintain the company's production capacity at 9.1 mtpy.
New projects (the proposed project and further extensions at Shidiya) are
low-cost, open-pit mines, and do not present major marketing risks (see
Chapter 3). JPMC's mining sector's total investment plan over the
1987-1998 period amounts to JD 171.4 million at current prices, of which JD
23.1 million is for the proposed project, including JD 0.7 million for dust
control equipment. The Mining Unit's corresponding annual depreciation is
projected to increase from JD 6.0 million in 1986 (average depreciation
period 11 years 2 months) to JD 13.6 million by 1997 (average depreciation
period 12 years 4 months), which is normal in the sector.
6.14      Working Capital Management.  The Mining Unit's working capital
management in 1987 is basically satisfactory: phosphate stocks represent
2.2 months of sales, commercial receivables, 3 months of sales, and
commercial payables about 5 months. HZwever, working capital management is
to be improved with regard to spare parts inventory (JD 7.9 million, or 13
months of consumption), which is excessively high under Jordan free import

situation, Government receivables (JD 18.4 million), and bank overdrafts
(JD 9.6 l11lion).

6.16      Cash Flow.  JPMC's overall cash flow will be lower in 1987 (JD
13.7 million) than in 1986 (JD 15.5 million), despite a slightly improving
cash flow of the Fertilizer Unit, due to rising operating costs at existing
mines and declining phosphate rock prices in Jordanian Dinars. After 1987,
however, the cash flow will increase rapidly up to JD 38.0 million in 1991,
with the start-up of the low-cost Shidiya mine and the improvement in the
Fertilizer Unit's financial performance resulting from higher capacity
utilization, as well as higher prices. From 1990-92, the company's cash
flow will stagnate around JD 35.0 million, as the operating costs reduction
from new mines development (Shidiya II and III) will offset by increasing
costs in El Hassa and El Abiad, and the Fertilizer Unit's cash flow will be
constant. After 1993, JPMC's cash flow will grow moderately, up to JD 56.1
million in 1997, due to the improved financial performance of the Mining
Unit, while the Fertilizer Unit's cash flow will remaxn constant, around JD
9.0 million. The achievement of projected cash flow targets is important
for JPMC to be able to service its existing and future debts and to
contribute to its future investment (para. 6.19). Therefore, agreement
was reached during negotiations on a working ratio, which determines the
available cash flow, below 0.8 from FY 1988 onward.
6.17      Debt Management.  Over the next four years, JPMC's management
will have to keep a suitable balance between the annual investment program
and the company's self-financing capacity after debt service on the one
hand, in order to maintain a sound financial structure, and between their
cash flow and their debt service on the other hand, in order to avoid the
recurrence of serious cash problems.
6.18      JPMC's projected debt service coverage ratio will reach its
lowest level in 1987 (0.84), due to the high JD 9.6 million debt service
for the Fertilizer Unit, in addition to the JD 6.7 million of the Mining
unit, with a lower cash flow. From 1987 onward, JF'C's debt service
coverage ratio is anticipated to improve significantly up to an acceptable
level, as its cash flow increases (para 6.14), the Fertilizer Unit's debt
service declines down to JD 2.8 million in 1994, and the Mining unit's debt
service is contained below JD 15.5 million. Agreement was reached during
negotiations that JPMC's overall debt service ratio will be no less than
1.5 from 1988 onward.
6.19      To maintain a sound financial structure, and to avoid an
excessive debt service increase, JPMC should limit their future investments
to those which have been discussed during project appraisal (para. 6.13).
The investment plan should be updated annually in consultation with the
Bank aF. least six months before the beginning of each fiscal year. This
was agreed during negotiations. Also, to maintain the company's
indebtedness level at a reasonable level, JPMC is expected to finance from
its own funds (self-financing capacity and future capital increases) about
40% of future investment, the 60X balance being long-term loans. This is
based on the assumption that (i) JPMC will pay a 40% tax on profit; (ll)
after-tax profit of the Fertilizer Unit will go to the Special Fund for the
Fertilizer Sector (para 2.20); and (iii) JPMC will retain about one-third
of its after-tax profit to strengthen its equity, the rest being
distributed to shareholders. During negotiations, it was agreed that



-40-
JPMC will maintain every year an overall debt/equity ratio below 60/40, and
that future loans in excess of JD 1.5 million will be subject to Bank prior
agreement.
6.20      Profitability.  JPMC's long-term overall profitability is
anticipated to be satisfactory, with an increasing profit before tax (after
accounting for the Fertilizer Unit's annual losses until 1990-91) of about
JD 6.7 million in 1988; JD 12.4 million in 1991; and JD 31.7 million in
1997.
6.21      Cash Situation.  JPMC will face a cash problem in the short-run
because of its high debt service as of end-1986.  The Mining Unit's cash
generation after debt service, with full distribution of after-tax profit
to shareholders, would not be sufficient to cover (i) an adequate share of
the Mining Unit's and Fertilizer Unit's investment plans; (ii) the Mining
Unit's and Fertilizer Unit's working capital reqitirements; (iii) the Mining
Unit's debt service; and (iv) the Fertilizer Unit's debt service. In order
to maintain a sound cash situation, the company is expected to retain about
half of its after-tax profit as equity at least until 1993. Also, JPMC
will have to raise its paid-up capital by about JD 25.0 million in 1987/88,
so that it can () meet their 1987 debt service for JD 4.0 million; (ii)
reduce their commercial payables by JD 2.0 million; (iii) reduce their
financial short-term debts by JD 6.0 million; and (v) reconstitute their
cash situation for future uses (including JPMC's contribution to the
proposed project) for JD 13.0 million. JPMC agreed during negotiations
that it will seek to increase its capital and special reserves by at least
JD 25 million by end-FY88, which will raise its equity to about JD 80
million. In the event this increase is not fully subscribed to, the
Government will assume the responsibility for the shortfall by subscribing
to the new issue in a sufficient amount to enable JPMC to achieve its
target of increasing equity. JPMC agreed during negotiations to isprove
its working capital management regarding spare parts inventory, which
should be reduced to less than 10 months of the previous year's consumption
by end-1988, 8 months by end-1989, and 6 months by end-1990, in order to
reduce the amount of liquidities tied up in stores from JD 12.2 million in
1986 to JD 7.7 million by end-1990.
C.   Financial Rate of Return and Sensitivity Tests
6.22      Financial Rate of Return.  The estimated Financial Rate of Return
(FRR) for the proposed project (Annex 6-10), in constant terms includlng
taxes, is 36.61. The project description for the FRR calculation is
the same as In the economic analysis (Chapter 7), except that the mine
access road (JD 700 thousand) and power supply (JD 300 thousand), to be
implemented by Government agencies and not charged to JPMC, are excluded.
The project financial cost is JD 25.4 million (US$76.7 million), including
physical contingencies, and project working capital of JD 4.0 million
(Annex 6-11). Project implementation is spread over 3 years.
6.23      Operating costs are calculated based on JPMC's experience with
mine operation under similar conditions. The difference between financial
and economic costs is mainly related to taxes being included in the



-41-
financial analysis (46% on fuel oil and 25% on electricity). With this
exception, and in the absence of Justification for labor and capital shadow
pricing in Jordan, the operating costs are the same as in the economic
analysis. Volumes and tonnages of overburden and ore have been estimated
based on JPMC's mining plan (Annex 6-7). Transportation costs from Shidiya
to Aqaba have been calculated, i'ncluding taxes, at JD 2.2/tonne. Port
charges are based on the existing marginal tariff of JD 0.65/tonne.
6.24      Phosphate rock prices are based on IEC projections, corrected for
Jordan's freight advantage of US$6/tonne to Asia and a US$3/tonne freight
disadvantage to Eastern Europe. It is assumed that Jordan will reflect
only 70% of the freight advantage or disadvantage on prices, the rest being
captured or borne by the client. It is assumed that Shidiya high grade
rock production will be exported mainly to India and the Far East, Jordan's
more rapidly developing markets.
6.25      The project's high FRR results from the low capital Intensity of
the project (US$7.62 per tonne of output at a 10% discount rate, or
US$56.73 per tonne of annual production capacity3!), due to the absence of
capital-intensive wet beneficiation in Phase I of the Shidiya development
plan. The low US$19.43 per tonne mine operating costs at 10% discount
rate (including US$11.13 per tonne mining costs and US$8.30 land
transport), due to the mine low stripping ratio (3:1 BCM/BCM), technically
straightforward dragline operation, and the relative proximity of the
deposit to existing land transport and port facilities also contribute to
the high FRR. The FOB Aqaba cost of Shidiya rock phosphate is US$27.92 per
tonne at 10% discount rate, as compared to a 1987 market price of US$32.00
to Us$36.00 per tonne for Shidiya quality rock.
6.26      Sensitivity Analysis.  The main identified risks are (i) 15%
higher project costs; (ii) increased transport cost of JD 3.00/tonne from
Shidiya to Aqaba (strict enforcement of axle load regulation); (iii)
phosphate prices 10% lower than anticipated combined with a 10% devaluation
of the US dollar compared to the Jordanian Dinar; and (iv) a lower demand
growth scenario (para 3.18). The table below indicates that under any of
these scenarios, the Project's FRR is still acceptable.

6.27.     The low growth scenario corresponds to the case where Jordan
would not expand their sales on the East European market and would
concentrate on the Asia market (para. 3.18). The corresponding sales
program is given in para. 7.09 below. The impact of the slower production
build-up on the Shidiya project is to lower its FR to a still acceptable
27.3%. The impact of the slower production build-up in terms of JPMC's
cash generation is limited to the years 1 to 4, as the project would reach
full production in that year. The financial impact of this scenario is
described below:

1/  Additional costs and loss of revenue are negative, savings on costs and
working capital are positive.
An alternative strategy for JPMC is to maintain Shidiya at full production
capacity, and to stockpile the excess production until the market can
absorb it. This strategy is not advisable, as it would create a temporary
cash shortage in 1991-93.
6.28      The materialization of low growth scenario would not jeopardize
JPMC's financial viability. The Company's overall cash flow after debt
service remains substantially positive and its debt service coverage ratio
is still above 1.5; moreover, JPMC's overall cash situation would still be
positive, with the exception of 1992, as indicated in the table below:

Therefore, JPMC's financial stracture, solvency and repayment capacity are
still satisfactory under the low growth scenario.
6.29      A phosphate rock price switching value for a 10X FRR has been
calculated. The phosphate price can be 35X lower than projected (US$20.22
In 1990; US$21.78 in 1995; US$23.27 in 2000) without the project FRR
dropping below 10%, demonstrating the financial soundness of the proposed
project.
D.  Pric  i!sk
6.30      The project faces no higher technical risks than those normally
associated with open-pit mining. All project activities involve proven
technology that has been in regular use in the industrialised world and in
Jordan. JPNC has considerable experience with the implementation of
similar open-pit mines in Jordan and has developed sound project management
techniques and tools. The main risks lie In marketing and prices, but
sensitivity analysis has demonstrated that under worst assumptions, the
project is-not exposed to serious risks in these areas.
YII. ECONOMIC ANALYSIS
7.01      The economic analysis demonstrates the project is economically
justified with an Economic Rate of Return (ERR) of about 37%. Sensitivity
tests are carried out in para. 7.06, indicating that within a large margin
of uncertainty regarding prices, world phosphate demand, project costs, and
land transport costs, the project is still economically justified. The
macroeconomic impact of the project in terms of foreign exchange balance,
employment, and income distribution is presented in para. 7.13.
A. Economic Rate of Return
7.02      The ERR was calculated following the standard Cost-Benefit
methodology. Total proJect cost is JD) 26.2 million, Including physical
contingencies JD 1.7 million, and working capital, JD 3.9 million. All
inputs are taken at market prices, except energy for which the following
corrections were made:

7.03      Port costs are calculated on the basis of the marginal economic
cost of an additional 1.5 million tonnes of port throughput (Annex 7-1).
As no additional port capital investment is required to handle the project
output, the marginal port cost includes only the marginal operating cost.
7.04      In the econowic analysis, land transport cost is calculated
excluding taxes (on diesel fuel, and imports of spares and trucks) but
Including road damage cost. The resulting cost (Annex 7-2) is JD 1.7
(US$5.47) per tonne from Shidiya to Aqaba. However, this estimate includes
a truck overloading factor, which should be eliminated. After correction,
the economic trucking cost Is about JD 2.2 per tonne.
7.05      The project ERR is 37.31 (Annex 7-3). This high rate is due
mainly to the low capital investment per tonne in the project initial phase
(Us$7.87 at 101 discount rate) resulting from thte absence of high cost
'wet' beneficiation, the low mine operating cost (US$9.69 per tonne) due to
favorable geological conditions (stripping ratio of 3:1 BCM/BCM), and the
low land transport and port costs (US$8.60 per tonne).

7.07      World Market Prices.  The main uncertainties regarding future
phosphate rock prices pertuin to the US dollar/Jordanian Dinar exchange
rate, which may increase substantially In the long-run and to possible
lower than expected phosphate prices, in US dollars. A possible 10% US
dollar/Jordanian Dinar exchange rate increase has been envisaged. In
addition, world prices in US dollar may be 10% lower than anticipated, if
present excess supply is not absorbed by 1990 (Chapter 3). Combining these
two factors, the ERR is still 24.6%.

7.08      The switching price for an ERR of 102 was calculated, indicating
how much below the Bank b-st estimate prices may drop without the project
ERR dropping below 10%. The conclusion is that with world prices 37% below
the Bank's best estimate (US$19.5 in 1990; US$20.9 in 1995; US$22.5 in 2000
and US$23.7 in 2005), the ERR is still 10%. For comparison purpose, the
average Jordanian export price, corrected for quality mix and destination,
was about US$34 per tonne in 1986.
7.09      Market Absorptive Capacity.  The project is based on an export
increase of 1.5 mtpy by 1990. The marketing analysis indicates that this
additional tonnage can be absorbed by J'rdan's existing clients. However,
there is a risk that the market's absorptive capacity of Jordanian rock may
be reduced because of lower world demand as described in the 'low scenario'
in para. 3.12, or increased competition from other producers. If this risk
would materialize, Jordan may have difficulties to expand its exports as
scheduled. The Shidiya project production build-up would be slower, and
full production capacity would be reached in 1992 instead of 1989. The
impact of a slower production build-up is to reduce the ERR to a still
acceptable 27.92.

7.10      Project Cost.  Project costs were estimated as JD 26.2 million.
However, a sensitivity test was carried out with a 15% higher investment
cost. The ERR is then 32.7%.
7.11      Transport Cost.  There is some uncertainty regarding trucking
costs. Indications are that present trucking tariffs of JD 1.4 to JD 1.7
per tonne from existing mines to Aqaba may be feasible only because
substantial truck overloading is practiced by truckers and because of
existing road transport over-capacities. It is estimated that a strict
enforcement of truck axle load limitation and charging the full marginal
economic cost may Increase land transport economic cost from JD 2.2
per tonne to JD 3.0 per tonne. The impact of this higher cost would be to
reduce the ERR to 32.3%.
7.12      Combined Risks.  Combining 10% lower world prices, a 10%
devaluation of the US dollar/Jordanian Dinar, 15% higher project capital
costs, and higher land transport costs, the ERR is still 16.9%.
C. Foreign Exchange Balance and Employment
7.13      Foreign and local currency balances are presented in Annex 7-4.
The overall cumulative foreign exchange balance, over the estimated 20-year
economic life of the Project, is JD 283.4 million at 1986 prices,
undiscounted. At a 10% discount rate it amounts to JD 95.4 million. The
break-even point in terms of foreign currency is only 3 years after the
project start-up. With an implicit exchange rate of US$6.8/Jordanian
Dinar4/, and the foreign exchange balance described above, the project
4/ The implicit exchange rate is the ratio of the cumulative net inflow of
foreign currencies, discounted at 10%, to the cumulative expenditures
in local currency incurred to secure the corresponding inflow of
foreign currencies, also discounted at 10%.

represents a major contribution to the country's balance of payments.
Assuming that 50% of capital investment is financed by foreign loans, at an
average 8% interest rate paiJ abroad, the balance is still highly
favorable, and the 10% discounted balance is still JD 86*1 million.
7.14      In terms of employment, th_. Project will generate directly some
746 Jobs. In addition, the Project will generate some 35 jobs In the Aqaba
port, and 100 jobs in the road transport industry (based on two truck
rotations per day and a crew of one).
VIII. AGREEMENTS REACHED AND RECOMMENDATION
8*01      During negotiations, the following agreements were reached:
(a) With the Government that it will:
(i) complete the construction of the access road to Shidiya by
December 31, 1988 (para. 4.14), and finance the corresponding
share of the Project cost;
(ii) cause JEA to complete the construction of the power line and
substation for the Project by December 31, 1988 (para. 4.15),
and finance the corresponding share of the Project cost; and
(iII) subscribe to a new issue of capital stock in JPMC to increase
JPMC's equity to JD 80 million, if the private offering is
not fully subscribed (para. 6.21).
(b) With JPMC that it will:
(i)  implement an action plan for JPMC's Managerial Integration
(para. 2.04 and Annex 2-2);
(ii)  keep separate accounts for the Mining and Fertilizer Units,
as well as consolidated accounts (para. 2.23);
(iii) have its annual accounts audited by auditors acceptable to
the Bank and that audited financial statements will be
presented to the Bank within 6 months of the end of each
fiscal year (para. 2.23);
(iv)  progressively reduce dust pollution at Aqaba, to
internationally aceptable standards by December 31, 1990
(para 4.22);



-48-
(v)  propose  plans for technical assistance (including planned
overseas visits and seminars) and submit them to the Bank
for review by end-FY88 and that hiring of consultants
commence by mid-FY89 (para. 4.24);
(vi) maintain a working ratio (working expenditures/current
revenues) below 0.8 from FY88 onward (para. 6.16);
(vii) maintain a debt service ratio above 1.5 in FY88 and
thereafter (para. 6.18);
(viii) update annually its 5-year investment plan in consultation
with the Bank at least 6 months prior to the beginning of
the fiscal year (para. 6.19);
(ix) maintain a long-term debt/equity ratio below 60/40 in FY88
and thereafter (para. 6.19);
(x) obtain Bank agreement to any new long-term loans in excess
of JD 1.5 million (para. 6.19);
(xi) raise its capital and special reserves by a minimum of JD 25
million by end-FY88 (para. 6.21); and
(xii) reduce spare parts inventory to 10 months of previous year
consumption by end-1988; 8 months by end-1989;and 6 months
by end-1990 (para. 6.21).
8.03      The proposed loan will become effective only upon receipt of
satisfactory evidence that JPMC has all necessary rights for use of water
and land at (i) the Shidiya mine site and townsite, and (ii) water wells
and water pipelines (para. 4.16).
Recommendation
8.04      Given the preceding commitments and agreements, the project is
suitable for a Bank loan of US$31 million equivalent for a term of 17
years, including a grace period of 4 years, at standard variable interest
rate.

HASHEMITE KINGDOM OF JORDAN
SHIDIYA PHOSPHATE MINE PROJECT
JPMC - Action Plan for Managerial Integration
Following the absorption of JFI, JPMC is modifying its company's
structure to Integrate functional departments and to develop new functions,
an necessary, to improve the company's management.
The following changes will be Implemented by JPMC's management:
(a) Establishment of an Internal Audit Unit. This unit would
take responsibility to ensure that each Department operates
in compliance with Company procedures. The Internal Audit
Unit will report directly to the General Manager.
Effectiveness will be June 30, 1988;
(b) The Planning function for the Company will be upgraded for
both technical planning (Mining and Fertilizer Units
production plan), and for corporate planning. This Unit
will also report directly to the General Manager, and will
be established and suitably manned by December 31, 1988;
(c) The Personnel Administration function for the Mining and the
Fertilizer Units will be integrated under a single authority
and follow a common personnel administration procedure
(although the personnel status may remain different in the
Mining and Fertilizer Units), by December 31, 1988;
(d) The accounting systems will be integrated on a compatible
basis and follow the same accounting principle, both for
financial and cost accounting purposes and be completed by
December 31, 1988;
(e) A specialized unit for financial analvsis in the Directorate
of Finance will be established and will be suitably manned

C. Selling Prices and Payment Practices
Tariff FOB Aqaba is calculated on a net-back basis, so that
Jordanian's rock C&F price is US$1 or 2 lower than the best placed
competitor. The resulting price range for Jordanian phosphate rock, 73%
TCP grade, is US$32 to US$41. Typical price ranges are:
Country                                          FOB Price
(US$)
Romania                 73/75% grade             35 - 36
India                  73/75% grade             40.5 - 41
Canada                  73/75% grade             32
Sales are 90% through direct negotiations, 10% international
tenders. About 20% are on a C&F basis, and 80% FOB. Payments are 40% cash
by letter of credit, 30% at 30 days and 30% at 60 days. A 1.5% discount is
applied for cash payment.

B. Prices
Although US DAP prices are the generally accepted benchmark
price, contract prices are highly variable depending on quantities,
destination, period of delivery, and on market competition. JPMC has no
defined pricing policy. Recent price trends for DAP FOB Aqaba were as
follows:
First half 1986           $180
Second half 1986          $150
December 1986             $140
February 1987             $190
Sales are about 75% on a FOB basis, and 25% C & F. Most inputs
are purchased under barter on counter trade agreements (about 50% of
sales). Non-barter sales are paid at sight by letter of credit. Rarely on
a 30 day term.
C. Inputs
Inputs are procured by the Marketing Department. In 1986, JPMC
purchased:

HASHEMITE KINGDOM OF JORDAN
SHIDIYA PHOSPHATE MINE PROJECT
JPMC Mining and Fertilizer Units Operating Costs
1.        Phosphate Mines.  The existing El Hassa and El Abiad mines are
cost effective by international standards, and comparatively light in
capital, due to the extensive recourse to contractors for overburden
removal (38X of 1986 cost at El Hassa, and 55% at El Abiad). Mine
production costs are expected to increase in the future with increasing
stripping ratios at existing mines, despite the utilization of low cost
dragline operation for overburden removal. Future operations will become
more capital intensive, as contractors are replaced by JPMC's own staff and
equipment.
2.        At a phosphate rock FOB price of about JD 11.0 per tonne, the E1
Rassa and El Abiad mines are profitable. They will remain economically
viable in the future until their reserves are depleted, as their cash costs
will increase but not exceed the expected sales price. The timing of
closure of El Abiad/El Hassa mines (scheduled tentatively for 1992 and
1997), and their cost monitoring, will be of major importance for the
company's future financial situation.

Source:  JPMC Estimates revised by IBRD and IEC.
3.        For risk analysis purposes, breakeven production levels have been
calculated based on a market price of JD 11.7 per tonne. The breakeven
production level for the 1.5 mtpy project is about 0.9 mtpy. For future
extensions (Shidiya II and III), the breakeven production level is
approximately 1.6 mtpy for each extension, as compared to a scheduled
production of 3.0 mtpy. In the future, the company's mining section's
profitability will be sustained by the increasing proportion of products
from the cost effective new Shidiya mines (JD 7.9/tonne).
4.        Fertilizer Unit.  The cost structure for each of the final
products of the Fertilizer Unit is given in the table below:

5.        At today's marketing prices for phosphoric acid, DAP and aluminum
fluoride, and input prices of sulphur, ammonia and phosphate rock,
phosphoric acid is non-profitable, DAP barely covers its cash cost, while
aluminum fluoride is highly profitable. It appears also that the
profitability of each product depends mainly on the price of raw materials
(89% of phosphoric acid cost; 79% of DAP cost; and 42% of aluminum fluoride
cost). Possible productivity improvements, except on raw material
consumption are not susceptible to change the present situation
substantially.
6 *       A product-by-product breakeven analysis indicates that at today's
irPut and sales prices, the fertilizer plant cannot become profitable, even
ai iOO% capacity utilization (present utilization: 72%). However, as the
main products (DAP and aluminum fluoride) are sold above their variable
production cost, there is no financial justification to reduce or to
discontinue their production. Based on financial considerations, JPMC's
strategy to increase production and capacity utilization to their design
levels is, therefore, fully justified.

ANNEX 6-4

Fertilizer Unit Financial Prolections
1.        The Fertilizer Unit revenue is projected to increase very rapidly
from 1986 to 1989 due to the combined increase in sales and export prices.
After 1989, sales volume will remain constant, as no production capacity
increase is envisaged and revenues will increase moderately with nominal
prices (Annex 6-5). The Fertilizer Unit's revenues will increase from JD
25 million (for 8 months of 1986) up to JD 57 million in 1990 and JD 72
million in 1998. The production level is projected to Increase from
550,000 tonnes of DAP and 12,000 tonnes of phosphoric acid in 1986 to
respectively 650,000 tonnes and 30,000 tonnes, after the elimination of
some of the technical problems encountered in 1986 by the company (mainly
cooling problems). Marketing of the additional output is not considered a
problem, given the flexible price policy adopted by JPMC in the past.
2.        Cash operating cost includes input costs for 79% to 89%
(sulphur, phosphate rock and ammonia). Most of the input coefficients
being fixed in the long-run, in the absence of technical modification to
the plant design, the Fertilizer Unit's cash production cost will depend
mainly on future input prices (Annex 6-5).
3.        Cash Flow and Profitability.  The Fertilizer Unit's cash flow is
projected to increase in between 1986 and 1990 from JD 0.9 million (8
months of 1986) to JD 9.2 million mainly because of the anticipated faster
price recovery of DAP and phosphoric acid as compared to input prices
(except ammonia). After 1990, all prices tend to follow a parallel trend,
and the Fertilizer Unit's cash flow is likely to be constant, around JD 9.0
million p.a.
4.        The Fertilizer Unit's profitability is expected to improve
significantly. In 1987, the Fertilizer Unit's anticipated loss is JD 5.9
million (14% of revenues), but it will breakeven in 1989, following the
cash flow improvement and the decline of interest on the long-term debt.
Thereafter, the Fertilizer Unit is anticipated to make a small profit of JD
2.0 to 3.0 million p.a. (4% of revenues) which is to be allocated in
priority to the reimbursement of the portion of former JFI debt taken over
by the Government.
5.        Investment and Debt.  In the short-run, JPMC is not considering
any investment in the fertilizer plant, which is still fairly new. In
consideration of the company's tight cash situation, and of the limited
profitability of the fertilizer sector, JPMC's policy seems reasonable. In
the longer run, investment will be limited to replacement of worn out
installationa. The estimated amount of replacement/improvement is expected
to be about JD 3.0 million p.a.
6.        The Fertilizer Unit's indebtedness and debt management policy are
determined by the 1986 JFI takeover agreement. Under this agreement, th.e
Fertilizer Unit's long-term debt has been reduced to JD 23.9 million.
However, this debt is to be repaid over 6 years only, at an average hiigh



- 83 -                    ANNEX 6-4
Page 3 of 6
interest rate of 12%.  The corresponding cash debt service on the old debt
is JD 8.4 million in 1987, down to JD 6.2 million in 1990 and JD 2.9
million in 1992. This exceeds JPMC's short-run debt servicing capacity,
and therefore, it has been obliged to roll over the 1987 and 1988 annuities
by subscribing a JD 14.9 million, 2-year grace plus 4-year rep.yment loan
at 7.5% interest. This restructuring is reasonable, as it permits JPMC to
postpone substantial cash outlays from a temporary period of tight cash
flow to a period of higher cash generation. However, the Fertilizer Unit
will have a debt service coverage ratio below 1 until 1992 but
substantially above 1 thereafter.
7.        The Fertilizer Unit's working capital management is efficient and
little is to be done to improve it, except to reduce spare parts inventory,
which represents 2 years of consumption in 1986 at JD 4.3 million, and
should be reduced to less than 3 months. Also, the existing short-term
bank overdrafts, which represented JD 5.8 million in 1986 (4 years of 1986
cash flow) should be eliminated or converted Into longer-term maturities.
8.        Despite a substantial cash flow increase, a declining debt
service and a conservative investment policy, t!, Fertilizer Unit will run
an increasing cash deficit, peaking at a cumulative JD 19.1 million in
1994, to decline slightly thereafter down to JD 15.2 million in 1998. This
cash shortage will have to be covered by the Mining Unit.
