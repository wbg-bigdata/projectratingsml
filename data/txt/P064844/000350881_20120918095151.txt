            This table containing sector indicators was included in the Logical Framework in the PAD, alongside actual PDO and GEO
level indicators, in order to report on overall sector performance. It should be noted that the sector indicators are beyond control of the
project intervention and are not meant to assess project performance. Nonetheless, the ICR team is of the view that the project
contributed to improvements in sector performance, as reflected in the report.

At the time of project appraisal in 2003, Cambodia had one of the lowest electrification
rates in Asia with only about 12% of its population of 13 million connected to a power
supply. Power generation relied almost purely on diesel fuels and costs were among the
highest in the world. The total installed capacity was 109 MW. Private independent power
producers (IPPs), engaged in early 1994 to reinstate supplies, provided 63% of the power
generated, while the state-owned Electricité du Cambodge (EDC) accounted for 32%.
There was no national grid and towns were supplied through isolated systems. Key
challenges facing the power sector at the time are summarized below.

Shortage of reliable electricity supply. The quality and reliability of power supply to
Phnom Penh were poor, and generation reserve margins remained low. Consequently,
many large consumers operated high cost, captive diesel-powered generators to meet their
energy needs. The national electricity network remained fragmented, precluding pooling of
generation capacity. There was no credible master planning for generation and transmission
system expansion.

High electricity costs. Electricity tariffs were very high, ranging from about US¢14/kWh
on EDC’s grid to about US¢30-92/kWh in rural areas served by Rural Electricity
Enterprises (REEs). Urban supply costs were high because the generation relied on small,
inefficient diesel generators with high fuel costs. In addition, IPP contracts provided for
high risk premiums. Rural supplies were expensive and limited as they (a) used very small
diesel generators, using costly fuel; (b) were small networks supplying power for a few
hours daily with high losses; (c) had low technical capacity; (d) had high risks borne by
operators due to lack of regulation and clear purchasing arrangements; and (e) had limited
access to capital for investments to improve efficiency or capture economies of scale.

Remarkably limited access to electricity in rural areas. Only about 6% of rural households
had access to grid-supplied electricity, and another 3% had some type of small individual
power-generating unit. The remaining 91% of the rural population either used car batteries
(costing US$2-3.5/kWh) to meet their most pressing needs, or went without altogether.

Steps toward sectoral reform. In 2001, the Royal Government of Cambodia (RGC) passed
a new Electricity Law and in 2002 it established the Electricity Authority of Cambodia
(EAC) as an independent regulatory body to license operating entities and to establish
electricity prices. The Electricity Law and subsequent implementation steps set the power
sector on a path to largely unbundle the sector with substantial private participation in
generation and distribution of electricity. The main reform issue was to strengthen the
newly established sector structure and further commercialize EDC’s operations.

In order to address the main sector issues, in May 2003, the Government adopted a 10 year,
three-phase Renewable Energy Action Plan (REAP), following extensive consultations
with key stakeholders. REAP’s three phases were: (a) market preparation, focusing on
institutional and regulatory development and private and public sector capacity building;
(b) an early growth phase, move forward with assessment of initial investments to be made
in hydropower and solar photovoltaics (PV); and (c) rapid growth, when robust market
growth was foreseen, with more private sector participation, and improved donor support to
leverage successful activities. RGC’s near-term strategy involved a combination of new
IPP generation and power imports from Vietnam, while its long-term strategy envisaged a

National Transmission System, a 193 MW hydropower plant and interconnections with
neighboring countries.

Rationale for IDA Involvement. In view of the challenges faced by the sector, RGC
requested IDA to design a rural electricity and transmission project that would facilitate
implementation of RGC’s strategy by alleviating shortages of reliable power and reducing
electricity costs for EDC’s grid; improving rural access to electricity; and consolidating and
deepening power sector reforms. The Project supported the Country Assistance Strategy of
February 2000 in that it contributed to building infrastructure to increase access to
electricity in rural and provincial areas, facilitated private sector development, and
contributed to institutional capacity building.

1.6 Main Beneficiaries
Primary beneficiaries expected at appraisal were the 112,000 new consumers in urban and
rural areas of Cambodia, including the 100,000 households that would be served by EDC
and REEs, and the 12,000 that would be provided Solar Home Systems (SHS). Urban
domestic consumers were expected to benefit from better quality, more reliable and lower-
priced electricity and commercial consumers would be able to retire their expensive captive
generation sets. Rural consumers would benefit from access to electricity, and the globally
well-documented welfare impacts associated with such basic amenities as lighting and
communication 3 . Households would also benefit through growth in non-farm rural
enterprises, and enhanced social services (street lighting, education, health clinics). Rural
consumers who already had electricity were expected to benefit from lower electricity
prices. Secondary beneficiaries included the EDC, EAC, the Ministry of Industry, Mines
and Energy (MIME), the Rural Electrification Fund (REF), and REEs as well as the
broader electricity sector through capacity building and progress towards
commercialization.

1.7 Original Components
The project had four components.
Component A. The Transmission Line (TL) (Total cost US$90.59 million, 60.35% of
total, of which US$16.97 million from IDA, 11.30% of total ), implemented by EDC,
comprised: (a) the construction of a 109 km double circuit 230 kV line from the border
with Vietnam to Phnom Penh and two associated substations; (b) reinforcement of the 115
kV grid around Phnom Penh involving about 20 km of 115 kV lines and modifications to
three 115 kV substations and 22 kV extension; (c) the establishment of a National Control
Center (NCC) to optimize load dispatch operations in the EDC system and increase system
security; and (d) building EDC’s capacity in project management, land acquisition,
resettlement and environmental monitoring and mitigation.
Component B. Rural Electrification (Total cost US$14.74 million, 9.82% of total, of
which US$ 12.81 million from IDA, 8.53% of total), implemented by EDC, comprised a
grid extension program covering 516 km of medium voltage (MV) and 536 km of low
voltage (LV) lines and electrification of about 50,000 consumers in the provinces of
Sihanoukville, Battambang, Kampot and Kampong Speu.

et al, EB-ASTAE, 2008); Monitoring the Benefits of Rural Electrification in Vietnam: Evaluation Surveys for 2002-2005 (Barnes et al,
WB, 2009).

Component C. Pilot Rural Electrification Fund (Total cost 28.23 million, 18.81% of
total, of which US$ 5.10 million from IDA and US$ 1.54 million from GEF, 4.43% of total),
executed by REF, was to implement an innovative mini- and off-grid electrification
program providing assistance to private sector developers for: (a) provision by REEs of
about 50,000 new connections; (b) provision of electricity to about 12,000 households
using SHS; and (c) addition of at least six MW of mini-hydro and 850kW of micro hydro
capacity.
Component D. Institutional Development and Sector Reform (Total cost US$9.33
million, 6.22% of total, of which US$ 5.12 million from IDA and US$ 4.21 million from
GEF, 6.21 of total), comprised consulting and advisory services to: (a) MIME in
renewable energy policy development, power market analysis, and development of a power
sector master plan; (b) REF for implementation support, promotion of rural income
generation options, renewable energy business development, REE improvement and
association building, and capacity building of financial institutions; (c) EAC for
institutional strengthening; and (d) EDC for services of a project implementation consultant
and in-house advisor, creation of an independent monitoring agency and a project
grievance committee, improvement of commercial practices, management training,
capacity building for land acquisition, resettlement and environment, and power investment
planning.

1.8 Revised Components
Three sub-components were revised through the restructuring in 2010. Reasons for all
revisions are provided in Section 2.2.
Solar Homes Systems (Component C(b)). As only 93 SHS had been installed at the time
of restructuring, the delivery model was revised from an “out-put based subsidy? approach
to a “hire-and-purchase? approach in order to jump-start installations. A new technical
assistance (TA) package was also added to help REF supervise the supply and installation
of the 12,000 SHS.
Mini and Micro Hydro (Component C(c)). The output was revised from installation of six
MW of mini hydro and 850 kW of micro hydro, to “conduct Feasibility Studies (FS) for
6,850 kW and install 1,200 kW of mini-micro hydro and biomass capacity?. Using the
unallocated balance, a new activity was added for construction of an office building,
critical for sustaining the REF’s operation after project closing.
TA to EDC (Component D(d)) was revised to add TA for a study on MV line planning to
support EDC in MV network expansion planning, identifying power loss locations in its
distribution networks for immediate upgrading; and to develop standard MV line technical
specifications and bidding documents for speedy expansion of MV lines to scale up rural
electrification.

1.9 Other significant changes
In addition, the closing date was extended three times. The first was from June 30, 2009 to
September 30, 2009; the second was from September 30, 2009 to February 28, 2010; and
the third was to January 31, 2012. The first two shorter extensions were granted to allow
the REF time to address financial management issues that arose in 2009. The 2010
restructuring and extension were approved in order to allow adequate time to achieve the
PDOs, especially SHS installation, and included a reallocation of funds to accommodate
the new TAs and construction of the REF office building mentioned above.
At appraisal the total project cost was estimated about US$142.98 million (baseline)
including the ADB loan, IDA credit and Government counterpart funds for ADB and IDA
components and Private funds. The actual project cost was recorded at closing date was
US$113.68 million. The drop mainly caused by less disbursement from IDA credit and

                                             4
ADB loans (US$84.3 million at appraisal vs US$74.49 million at closing date) and less
disbursement of government counterpart funds (US$29.71 million at appraisal vs US$13.34
million at closing date).

2. Key Factors Affecting Implementation and Outcomes

2.1 Project Preparation, Design and Quality at Entry

Soundness of Background Analysis. The Project was built upon the Energy Sector
Strategy for Cambodia and the Renewable Energy Strategy of 2001. Priorities of RGC’s
long term strategy for the energy sector were to: (i) address the shortage of reliable energy
supply; (ii) reduce EDC’s high cost of supply; (iii) increase rural electricity coverage; and
(iv) reform the power sector. There was consensus among stakeholders that a joint
private/public effort was essential to achieve these goals. The project was tailored to
contribute to implementing this strategy and address sectoral challenges. Project design
took into account lessons learned from other countries4. For instance, a lesson emerging
from international experience at the time of preparation was that targeting subsidies could
be an effective way of leveraging private investment in rural electrification. Consequently,
the design of the REF component incorporated the concepts of output-based subsidies and
transparency, for the purpose of creating “capital enabling? conditions, rather than
providing total project funding or credit guarantee.

Assessment of Project Design. The project design, bringing together a transmission line
extension and reinforcement component, a rural electrification component involving MV
and LV lines, the piloting of a REF to deliver electricity access to remote and off-grid areas,
accompanied by technical assistance and capacity building for key entities in the sector,
was straightforward, clear and internally consistent. The project was designed to address
the key issues facing the sector at the time and responsive to the needs of the client. It was
built on prevailing international practice at the time, and its preparation involved solid
background analysis, which informed its design. The project components reflected a
combination of fundamental requirements that should reasonably be expected in any
comprehensive rural electrification effort and innovations such as piloting of the OBA and
REF concepts, which were rather novel concepts at the time of preparation. Some
highlights of the strong points of project design are summarized below.

     (a) In order to improve sector efficiency and reliability, the design included new high
         voltage (HV) lines for power import, reinforcing HV lines, upgrading substations,
         and building MV and LV lines. These investments not only improved the reliability
         of supply but also contributed to transmission and distribution efficiency by
         reducing system losses. The construction of the 230 kV line is a critical component
         of the effort to alleviate power supply shortages and ensure the security of supply
         over the medium term.

     (b) The decision to complement EDC grid extension with support for provision of new
         connections by REEs and off-grid solutions was a very sensible way of pursuing the
         government’s electrification target for expanding electricity access in remote areas,
         especially in view of the time and resources that would be required had this been
         sought through expansion of the EDC system alone.


4
          Among others, initiatives that were looked into included the Sri Lanka Energy Services Delivery Project, Indonesia Solar
Home Systems Project, Bangladesh Rural Electrification and Renewable Energy Development Project, and Uganda Energy for Rural
Transformation Project.




                                                                5
     (c) During identification, EDC had neither sufficient capacity nor technical, human and
         financial resources to extend its modest grid into rural areas, so RGC chose to
         engage REEs to expand the local networks to serve rural households. Combining
         the efforts of EDC and REEs to achieve these objectives was a wise choice.
     (d) The investment components were complemented by TA activities that enhanced the
         capacity of key sector participants, by supporting project management and
         developing business models to encourage private sector participation in renewable
         energy development and distribution network expansion for rural electrification.
     (e) The pilot REF program, which introduced the OBA concept for off-grid access and
         renewable energy activities to capitalize on the private sector’s presence, which was
         expected to undertake pre-investment studies and initiate investments.
         Conceptually, it suited Cambodia’s situation since government funding for off-grid
         extension and renewable energy development was very limited.

Overall, the project was a well designed project. However, there were some a few
shortcomings in design. Even though these shortcomings were relatively minor in the
context of a solid rural electrification and transmission project, and did not have a
significant impact on the achievement of the key development outcomes, they are discussed
below, with a view to informing the design of future projects of this kind. The paragraphs
below outline a few areas where things could have been done better.

     (a) First, the project results framework could have been designed better. Even though
         the stated CAS- and sector-wide objectives were relevant and important, the
         inclusion of sector-level key performance indicators in the results framework meant
         that the performance of this rural electrification project would be measured against
         sector-wide outcomes beyond the immediate reach of the project. Section 2.3
         contains more discussion about shortcomings in the results framework.

     (b) Second, even though it was conceptually sound, the pilot SHS OBA subcomponent,
         involving piloting the concept of installation of SHS by dealers, companies and
         REEs complemented with OBA proved challenging to implement. The
         implementation of this subcomponent faced challenges primarily because most
         households could not afford the required upfront payment and because SHS sizes
         offered initially were not found desirable by some households involved. Even
         though various studies were undertaken to assess the market for SHS 5 during
         preparation, a more detailed assessment upfront may have been necessary.
         Nonetheless, during implementation the weak aspects of the approach being piloted
         was identified, and properly addressed during preparation.
     (c) Third, achieving the mini- and micro- hydro capacity targets could have been made
          possible by the inclusion of more rigorous support under the REF component, going
          beyond the modest resources and support provided in the form of TA on renewable
          energy technologies and business models and a small awareness campaign aimed at
          encouraging local institutions to lend to REEs. Of the shortlist of potential mini-
          and micro-hydro projects identified through prefeasibility studies during
          preparation, none had a feasibility study. The provision of completion of feasibility
          studies before RETP effectiveness, and the presentation of a set of implementation-

         These studies cited in the PAD include (i) Investing in solar PV in Cambodia: Market Study and Business Models; (ii) Market
Development and promotion plan for SHS; (3) Financing PV Household Electrification in Cambodia and (4) Photovoltaic market
development in Cambodia.




                                                                 6
       ready projects for the private sector to invest in could have made it more likely for
       the targets to be achieved.  

Even though the results framework, the initial pilot SHS delivery scheme, and the mini and
micro- hydropower sub-components could have been designed better, these shortcomings
did not have a significant bearing on the achievement of the broader development objective,
which was the expansion of electricity access to unserved population for fostering growth
of rural economy and enhancing the efficiency of the electricity system. The parts of the
project where there were weaknesses in design correspond to a rather small portion of the
project, and these weaknesses are relatively minor when seen in the context of a much
larger and well-designed rural electrification project. Moreover, the issues with the initial
design of OBA pilot were addressed during implementation, with the delivery modality
being revised, which led to the original target not only being met, but exceeded.

Safeguards. The Project was appropriately assigned “Category B?, as potential impacts
were expected to be moderate. Two safeguards policies were triggered by the project:
Environmental Assessment (OP/BP 4.01) and Involuntary Resettlement (OP/BP 4.12).
Detailed studies on potential environmental and social impacts were carried out, and the
findings of the studies served as the basis for the mitigation measures outlined in the
Environmental Management Plans (EMP), Resettlement Action Plans (RAP), Resettlement
Policy Framework (RPF), and Ethnic Minority Development Strategy (EMDS).All key
environmental and social safeguards documents were finalized after stakeholder
consultations bringing together beneficiaries, community groups, the national government,
Non-Governmental Organizations (NGO) and development partners, and were disclosed
locally and on the internet. Overall, the impacts identified were accurate, the consultations
carried out before and during the project were adequate, and mitigation measures put in
place were effective.

Adequacy of Government Commitment. RGC’s commitment to sustainable energy
development was clear from the start, with the sector reform process that began in 2000 as
discussed in Section 1.1 above. In addition to making significant policy decisions, RGC
showed its commitment to furthering the rural electrification agenda by requesting IDA
financing for the project, and requested an advance from the Project Preparation Facility
(PPF) to cover project preparation costs and complete the set-up of EAC. RGC also
requested IDA support for a grant from the Private Participation Infrastructure Advisory
Facility (PPIAF) to support preparation of a private policy framework and guidelines to
encourage private power investment in power generation and distribution in rural areas.

Risk Assessment. Risks to the achievement of the PDO/GEO were appropriately identified
and included the possibility of: (a) the emergence of unsolicited and non-competitive
Power Purchase Agreements (PPAs), (b) RGC and EDC not honoring their financial
commitments, (c) lack of transparency in implementation of regulatory rulings and EAC
decisions, and (d) Vietnam not honoring the PPA. The overall risk rating was “moderate?.
In hindsight, however, the several additional risks could have been included:

   (a) First, the oil price volatility risk was not adequately assessed. During project
       preparation, the lower cost power anticipated to be supplied Vietnam was expected
       to be the main driver of cost reduction. However, when the imports from Vietnam
       did not materialize at the volumes envisaged as a result of the country’s own
       struggle to keep up with rapidly growing demand, the cost of electricity supply in
       Cambodia continued to be exposed to oil prices, given the heavy reliance on diesel
       and fuel oil. Meanwhile, the financial analysis carried out at appraisal was
       exploring scenarios where international crude oil prices would stay constant at the
       US$ 30 range, or decrease to a yearly average of around US$25 per barrel from
       2004 and stabilize thereafter. So when the average price of a barrel of crude oil

                                             7
       jumped from US$30 at appraisal to US$50 at project effectiveness, and then soared
       to over US$133 a barrel by July 2008, the achievement of the cost reduction
       objective was no longer feasible.

   (b) A second under-assessed risk was that of unavailability of financing from local
       commercial banks and financial institutions to REEs for investment in small
       renewable energy and rural electrification. This can be explained partly by the 2009
       global financial crisis, which could not have been anticipated at the time of
       preparation, and partly by the limits to the technical and financial capacities of
       REEs to prepare feasibility studies leading to bankable projects. Even though the
       team correctly identified the performance of REEs and local financial institutions in
       expanding rural electricity supply as a condition for ensuring sustainability of the
       project components, the risk of local financial institutions’ unwillingness to lend to
       REEs was not adequately emphasized. Had this risk been assessed properly, the
       project scope could have adopted mitigation measures beyond a small awareness
       campaign and directly target local institutions to encourage them to lend to REEs.

   (c) The risk of significant delays in the REF becoming operational was not foreseen.
       This delay – a total of 24 months – affected the realization of component’s output
       targets on time and was one of the factors leading to the need for extension of the
       project’s closing date.

Overall the project’s quality at entry is rated moderately satisfactory.

2.2 Implementation
Delays in Start-up. At the beginning of project implementation, delays were experienced
for three main reasons:
      Delays in formation of government after elections. Although the Bank approved
       the project in November 2003, the signing of the legal documents was delayed by a
       year, to November 2004, due to delays in the formation of a new government.
       These delays forced the borrower and Bank to extend the refinancing date of the
       PPF several times in line with Credit effectiveness.
      Delays in appointing key PMU staff. Even though two Project Management Units
       (PMUs) were formally established prior to Credit effectiveness, the implementation
       of the EDC and MIME components faced delays and bottlenecks due to delays in
       appointing key staff. Appointments were completed in early 2006, nearly a year
       after effectiveness.
      Slow progress in establishing the REF. There were delays in selecting the
       technical advisor and financial management consultant; delays in appointing the
       Executive Director (ED); and delays in hiring key REF Secretariat staff. Thus the
       REF could not begin full operations until April 2007, two years after effectiveness.

Revisions during Mid-Term Review. The project’s mid-term review (MTR) carried out in
2008 confirmed that both the PDOs and GEO remained valid, but that their achievement
would require a restructuring and extension of the closing date. Of particular concern was
the progress in SHS installation. By the end of December 2009, only 93 SHS had been
installed out of the target of 12,000, primarily because rural households could not afford
the upfront payments to the suppliers. Consequently, the delivery model was changed to a
“hire-and-purchase? model based on successful experience in neighboring Lao PDR, with
REF carrying out bulk purchases of SHS and with the private sector providing installation
and services. When households were allowed to pay in installments over as much as 48
months, interest grew rapidly and the installation target was reached in less than six months.


                                               8
Regarding the mini and micro hydropower subcomponent, by the MTR, no FS had been
completed. As discussed above, the key factors included the REEs’ weak capacity and
unavailability of the legal, regulatory and financing environment to support the needs of the
REEs. By January 2010, it became clear the original targets could not be met, so the
subcomponent was restructured to reduce the targets to completing FS for 6,850 kW and
installation of 1,200 kW of mini-micro hydro and biomass capacity.

Procurement delays also affected the timely completion of the NCC (Component A(c)). A
complaint from one of the bidders resulted in the delays. The bidder was eventually
provided with adequate clarifications and the case was resolved. The NCC was finally
completed in January 31, 2012, about 44 months behind schedule.

2.3 Monitoring and Evaluation (M&E) Design, Implementation and Utilization

Design. The M&E framework was moderately satisfactory, particularly in terms of
indicators set at the level of project outputs. A key shortcoming of the M&E framework
was that some outcome indicators were not fully within the control of the project and some
indicators were not directly linked to the project design. Although this was a well-designed
rural electrification and transmission project, the formulation of the PDO level indicators
created the impression that the project would address sector level issues, over which the
project could only have partial impact. Examples are provided below.

   (a) The indicator on the reduction of EDC's electricity supply cost, was not fully under
       control of the project. Although imported power from Vietnam was expected to
       reduce the cost of EDC’s supply, when the delivery of the anticipated volumes
       turned out to not be feasible, imports from Vietnam represented only a portion
       (44%) of the energy supplied in 2011, while the rest (56%) was supplied by fossil
       fuel-fired power plants and hydropower as well as purchases from other
       neighboring countries. As explained in Section 2.1, the higher than expected
       reliance on fossil fuel-fired generation, amid high international oil prices, in turn,
       rendered the achievement of the cost reduction indicator unfeasible. The project had
       no control over how much energy Vietnam was able to deliver through the
       interconnection, amid its own rapidly growing demand, nor did it have control over
       international oil prices.

   (b) Another indicator not having any directly linked activities was “Increase in local
       commercial lending and other financing for rural electrification and renewable
       energy?. It was expected that local commercial banks and other financing
       institutions would lend REEs/IPPs up to US$ 15 million for rural electrification and
       renewable energy development. However the only activities supporting this
       indicator were capacity building for financial institutions and REEs to improve their
       understanding of the renewable energy technology, business, and increase appraisal
       and supervision ability of the financial institutions.

   (c) At appraisal, RGC’s target for rural electricity coverage, combining EDC’s grid,
       stand-alone mini-grids and remote off-grid solutions, was 70% by 2030. While the
       project certainly contributed to the achievement of this target, it is obvious that
       what happens by 2030 was beyond the project’s control.

Even though the results framework could have been improved in terms of the formulation
of some indicators, it was consistent with Bank practice at the time. Overall, the results
framework accurately captured the PDO and contained indicators that could reasonably be
expected from a rural electrification and transmission project.



                                             9
Implementation. All four implementing agencies (IAs) had adequate arrangements for
providing timely monitoring and progress reports. They regularly collected data relating to
the indicators agreed during project preparation and those redesigned during the
restructuring. The intermediate results indicators were regularly monitored and reported.
EAC collected data beyond project indicators and published them for public access
annually. EDC published its annual reports regularly while REF collected its own data for
project indicators.

Utilization. The M&E framework was useful in monitoring project implementation
progress, and allowing the client and the Bank to take proactive actions and make changes
to allow the realization of project objectives. Two cases where this was done were the
revisions of (i) the SHS delivery modality; and (ii) the KPI concerning the “construction of
6,850 kW hydropower? to completion of feasibility studies during the restructuring in 2010.
There was certainly a missed opportunity during the MTR, when the results framework was
revised, but stopped short of addressing remaining weaknesses, as discussed in Section 5.

2.4 Safeguard and Fiduciary Compliance

Safeguards

The project’s social and environmental documents were disclosed in line with the Bank
policy. EMP containing mitigation measures were prepared for the construction and
operations of the 230 kV (HV) transmission lines, substations, reinforcement of 115 kV
transmission lines, and grid extension. Under the REF pilot program, the EMP provided
measures for off-grid connections, construction of mini and micro hydropower plants, and
SHS installation. At the restructuring, the EMP of the REF pilot program was revised as an
Environmental and Social Management Framework (ESMF) to provide clearer guidance
for construction of mini and micro hydropower projects, biomass project development and
SHS installation.

Environmental and resettlement issues for RETP were insignificant, as the lines were pole--
mounted and did not involve major land acquisition. Some tree-cutting and pruning
occurred and EDC provided compensation to the private tree owners. There was land
acquisition of 64,217m2 for substation construction at West Phnom Penh and land owners
were compensated in a timely manner according to the RAP.

One complaint was registered by Project Affected People (PAPs) in November 2008 when
construction of the 115 kV line began before the Inter-ministerial Resettlement Committee
(IRC) provided full compensation. In response to the complaint, EDC, with support from
the Bank, suspended construction in the field and conducted a series of public consultations
and discussions with the PAPs, which led to agreement on an acceptable resettlement
compensation package and construction schedules. The case was satisfactorily resolved in
December 2008. In 2010, in response to EDC’s need to quickly acquire land for
construction of hydropower plants and transmission lines supported by other sources, RGC
delegated tasks related to land acquisition and compensation to EDC for its own projects.
To discharge its newly delegated task, EDC increased its Social and Environmental Unit
(SEU) staff from three to eight. Since then, all land acquisition and compensation works
have been carried out by SEU in cooperation with local authorities and with PAPs
involvement. Monitoring and recording quality of EMP implementation were relatively
poor at the beginning, but the IAs gradually improved with assistance from the supervision
consultants and the Bank. An external monitoring consultant was engaged to assess the
safeguard implementation and concluded “RAP implementation was going well…?,
“people have known well about the project and its benefit…?, and “affected households
were well aware of the project.?


                                            10
Fiduciary

Procurement. At appraisal, responsibility for procurement was delegated to the IAs. The
procurement capacity assessment determined the overall procurement risk was average. A
procurement plan was prepared as part of the Project Implementation Plan including
procurement packaging, procurement methods, contract types, schedules, etc. More than
95% of the procurement of goods was to be carried out through ICB procedures and subject
to IDA prior review.

As discussed in Section 2.2, EDC experienced delays in contracting the NCC supply and
installation due to complaints lodged by a bidder. Following the appropriate procedures for
handling procurement complaints, with guidance from the Bank, the complaint case was
eventually resolved.

EAC and MIME did not experience any procurement related issues. The only issue was the
limited capacity of MIME in carrying out procurement within its authorized thresholds,
which caused some delays in securing TA services, such as the sustainable charcoal pilot
TA, one of the activities under Rural Energy Strategy formulation TA, which supported
Renewable Energy Policy Development sub-component D1.1.

Engagement of IPA. Following evidence of corruption found in seven Bank-financed
projects in 2006 (RETP was not implicated), and as part of remedial measures designed to
mitigate the risk of misprocurement in Bank-financed projects, the RGC and the Bank
agreed in 2007 to engage an IPA to handle procurement for all Bank-supported projects in
Cambodia. It was decided in December 2008 that the IPA would carry out all procurement
under RETP, except for the following activities, which would be undertaken by the IAs: (i)
Selection of Individual Consultants and hiring of NGOs; (ii) Direct Contracting (for Goods
and Works) and Single Source Selection (Consulting Services); (iii) Procurement of Goods
estimated to cost less than US$50,000; and (iv) Procurement of Works estimated to cost
less than US$100,000.
Introduction of the Good Governance Framework. Another remedial measure put in place
following the identification of fiduciary issues in 2006 was the preparation and
implementation of Good Governance Frameworks (GGF) by all IAs (EDC, EAC, MIME,
and REF) in 2009. The GGF aimed at mitigating risks through (i) information disclosure;
(ii) civil society involvement; (iii) complaints and remedies mechanism; (iv) Code of
Ethical Conduct; and (v) sanctions. GGF was translated into local languages for easy
observance by staff of the IAs. All IAs reported on GGF implementation regularly and
implementation performance was satisfactory.

Financial management. Two incidences of forgery of invoices were identified in June
2009 in REF’s request for disbursement. This resulted in a downgrading of the FM rating
to Unsatisfactory for the Project as a whole as of June 2009. A series of remedial actions
were taken by REF to correct the situation. They included (i) appointment of a new finance
manager to replace the old one who was asked to resign; (ii) appointment of a senior
accountant; (iii) appointment of an internal auditor; and (iv) reconstruction of the books of
accounts and reconciliation of each source of funds (IDA, GEF, and counterpart funds); (v)
refunding of the ineligible and un-reconciled amounts found; and (vi) completion of the
external audit of the project’s reconstructed books of accounts for the fiscal years 2007 and
2008. Resolution of these issues took some time, leading to further delays in processing the
restructuring in 2009, but clean audits were received thereafter.

2.5 Post-completion Operation/Next Phase

EDC performance after project completion. Following the revision of EDC’s tariff in
2010, EDC revenue has increased substantially. EDC’s revenue is expected to be sufficient
to support operation and maintenance and small scale investment up to 2016. All costs of
668 km of LV line construction under the project (in five provinces) were covered by EDC
funds. With EDC’s ability to increase supply about 19% per annum on average, EDC’s
revenue is expected to continue to increase accordingly. According to the economic and
financial analysis (Annex 3) EDC is expected to continue to remain financially viable.
With well-designed arrangements for system expansion planning supported by the project
and other sources, and after installation of Financial Accounting and Utility Management
Information System (FAUMIS), EDC’s combined technical and non-technical losses are
expected to be maintained below 10%. EDC has prepared a MV line expansion plan for its
entire service area, with a total investment cost of about US$ 600 million. EDC will need to
revise the plan from time to time to align it with population growth and availability of
capital investment.

A critical challenge for EDC will be to ensure the availability of adequate staff with
required technical knowledge, especially for the newly established NCC and the SEU.
Under RETP, eight NCC core staff received extensive overseas training during the set-up
of the Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition (SCADA) system. Even though this
capacity building was effective, more effort is needed to ensure continuous operation of the
NCC. Consistent with advice from the Bank, EDC hired additional staff for NCC operation,
and their training should start in January 2013, under TA from JICA. Similarly, continued
capacity building for SEU staff will be necessary to allow it to perform EDC’s recently
assigned responsibilities for land acquisition and compensation. EDC intends to use
funding under other ongoing donor-funded projects to this end.

Replicating and scaling up of project accomplishments. A new project, the proposed
“Cambodia Rural Electrification Project? was intended to build on the accomplishments of
RETP. Its intent was to fund MV lines to reach un-served rural villages, traversing existing
REE areas in some cases. Outside REE areas, EDC would install LV network including
metering points to connect new rural households. Inside REE areas, REEs would purchase
electricity in bulk from EDC to dramatically reduce its generation costs. However, no new
energy sector project is present in the Bank’s pipeline. If follow-up engagements are
contemplated, they could include: (i) support to further extension of MV and LV lines, (ii)
continuation of TA for key sector entities, especially for system development planning, and
(iii) financing for power generation, particularly low cost generation options and renewable
energy resources for remote areas.

3. Assessment of Outcomes

3.1 Relevance of Objectives, Design and Implementation

The PDO remained highly relevant to Cambodia’s economic and social development and
suitable to the country’s needs in the power sector. Cambodia’s electrification rate remains
among the lowest in East Asia. Increasing access to electricity to foster economic growth
and improve living standards continues to be a priority objective for RGC. At closing
however, the Bank did not have an up-to-date CAS to address the remaining issues in the
power sector. Still, the Project remained consistent with the last CAS progress report
discussed by the Board in 2008.

3.2 Achievement of Project Development Objectives and Global Environment
Objectives
PDO Overall Rating: Moderately Satisfactory
Cambodia’s energy sector made solid progress over the life of RETP, in part, due to the
support it provided. Complementing investment support through the provision of TA in
system planning, RETP was able to guide sector investments to achieve sustainable,
reliable power supply in the medium and long term. The project’s achievements with
regard to the PDO and GEO are elaborated below.
Objective (a): Improving power sector efficiency and reliability and reducing costs of
electricity supply
Rating: Moderately Satisfactory
Through the project’s investments in the transmission network and rural electrification,
under Components A and B, complemented by the TA provided, Cambodia’s electricity
supply is now more efficient and reliable as elaborated below.
 Power sector efficiency has improved. The project contributed to improving capacity
    both through investments made in HV, MV and LV system expansion, support to REEs,
    and TA for various stakeholders. The project not only helped improve distribution
    system efficiency, but also allowed industrial and commercial users and REEs to switch
    from inefficient diesel generators to clean, grid-supplied electricity. The total power
    consumption of commercial and industrial consumers switching from diesel generators
    to grid supply was recorded as nearly 40 MW as of March 2012, exceeding the 30 MW
    target at appraisal. In addition, 53% of REEs retired their relatively small, inefficient
    diesel generators and switched to the EDC grid for their energy supply. (Total power
    switch figure is not available.)
    The project also contributed to efficiency improvements in the broader power sector,
    through: (i) supporting enhanced power system development planning, to allocate
    resources more efficiently; (ii) contributing to the preparation of the master plan and
    subsequent development of the Kamchay hydropower plant and associated HV
    transmission line connecting the power plant, which further enhanced generation
    efficiency; (iii) enhancing the capacity and effectiveness of key sector participants,
    including EDC, REEs, MIME, EAC and REF. With better network design and the new
    FAUMIS, EDC was able to reduce systems losses from 14% at appraisal to 9.8% at
    closing, well exceeding the target of maintaining losses at 14%.
 Supply reliability has improved. At appraisal, the total installed generation capacity in
    the country was 109 MW, or about 10% short of demand (118MW), forcing EDC to cut
    power supply to about three hours per day. At closing, capacity was able to meet
    demand, with installed generation capacity at 620 MW, and with generation capacity
    owned by EDC having increased from 52 MW at appraisal to 153MW. The System
    Average Interruption Duration Index was nearly halved in the first part of 2012 alone,
    decreasing from 60 minutes per customer per day in February to 31 minutes by the end
    of May, according to EDC data.
 Furthermore, the reliability of rural supply has improved, with REEs’ daily service
    hours having risen from four hours at appraisal to 12 hours by closing, or a 50%
    increase over the target of eight hours of service. In fact, some 54% of REEs provide
    24 hour service.
 Reducing costs. The desired reduction in EDC’s cost of power supply was not achieved.
    The average cost of power supply was slightly reduced from US$0.15/kWh at appraisal
    to US$0.145/kWh (including VAT and imported tax), but fell short of the target of
    US$0.11/kWh. As explained in Section 2.2, this was primarily due to factors beyond
    the control of the project, particularly the increase in the cost of fuel for power

                                            13
    generation, resulting from a surge in oil prices on international markets. Moreover, the
    cheaper imported power that was expected to come from Vietnam did not fully
    materialize, as Vietnam has provided only 135MW out of the 200MW agreed in the
    PPA. Out of the total 2,564.07 GWh of energy supplied by EDC in 2011, about 1,662
    GWh (65%) was purchased from neighboring countries and about 902 GWh (35%)
    supplied by domestic IPPs (fuel, coal-fired and hydropower).
Objective (b): Improving standards of living and fostering economic growth in rural
areas by expanding rural electricity supplies
Rating: Satisfactory
Through the expansion of distribution networks, the living standards of targeted rural
households have improved.
 Overall, the project has helped expand rural electricity coverage with some 565,733
    people (117,861 households) having gained access to modern energy services, nearly
    meeting the target of 567,000 people. (More people will be able to access modern
    energy services as new connections to the established distribution networks, as a result
    of RETP, continue.) Although no surveys were done, observations made and
    conversation with randomly selected households, supervision missions indicate that
    standards of living in the project areas have improved, with households now using
    refrigerators, fans, water pumps, radios and televisions for the first time.
 The retail tariff charged for electricity supply to households in rural areas covered by
    licensed REEs declined from US$0.60/kWh to US$0.35/kWh, exceeding the
    US$0.425/kWh target. This reduction was made possible when REEs switched from
    inefficient, expensive self-generation to EDC’s grid supply. As a result of expanding
    electricity access and lower tariffs, income-generating opportunities became available
    to rural households. In anticipation of this, the project offered customized training on
    various types of income-generating activities such as sewing clothes for the garment
    industry, dress-making, tailoring, hair-dressing, and agricultural processing.
 Although systematic surveys determining the impact of electricity access on income-
    generation were not carried out, anecdotal evidence from Bank supervision, REF
    consultants, and the Borrower’s completion report suggests that about 15% of newly
    electrified households started up businesses (see photos 4 - 12 in Annex 2) and their
    self-reported increase in income has ranged between Riel 300,000 (US$75) to Riel
    1,000,000 (US$250) per month, depending on the type of business.
Objective (c): Strengthening electricity institutions, the regulatory framework and the
"enabling environment" for sector commercialization and privatization
Rating: Moderately Satisfactory
The TA provided under the project supported development of required Regulations and
Codes to be used by EAC and facilitated the licensing and operation of private REEs in the
electricity business. To date, all 11 required Regulations and Codes were issued and are
being used by EAC, except for the “Distribution Codes? which are being finalized. With
these Regulations and Codes in place, EAC issued licenses to 297 REEs, exceeding the
original target of 180, which was facilitated by the extension of the closing date. The
licensing of the REEs, in turn, contributed to the extension of grid supplied electricity
services to 50,000 new households. The project also resulted in the development of four
private companies active in the renewable energy business, one short of the original target
of five companies. This difference can be explained by the reluctance of local commercial
banks to finance renewable energy and/or rural electrification businesses, as discussed in
Section 2.
The project also indirectly contributed to the development and operation of 193 MW of
hydropower capacity, through the support provided for the preparation of a power system

                                            14
master plan, construction of a partial power evacuation route connected to this power plan,
and the establishment of NCC. Further details on strengthening the electricity institutions
and regulatory framework development are described in Section 3.5(b) below.
GEO Overall Rating: Moderately Satisfactory

The project’s success in overcoming barriers to renewable energy development, including
those related to lack of a policy framework, financing, information and institutional
capacity, is rated moderately satisfactory.

The project supported the removal of barriers to renewable energy development through
multiple channels. Barriers to be overcome (lack of renewable energy policy, strategy and
capacity to plan, provide and finance renewable energy systems; high initial costs and lack
of awareness and confidence in renewable energy systems among potential suppliers and
consumers) were addressed through support for policy development, financing outreach
and institutional capacity building, complemented by support for SHS and the mini-hydro
capacity development. These achievements are summarized below.

   (a) Policy development. The project supported the development of measures and
       analyses to contribute to Renewable Energy Policy (activity D.1.1) that created a
       level playing field for renewable energy private sector investors based on renewable
       energy assessments and least cost planning. The engagement through project
       provided a channel for continued policy dialogue with the government. For
       instance, as a result of the dialogue carried out through the project, the government
       recognized that the relatively high cost of imported SHS was one of barriers in
       renewable energy development. To remove this barrier, on August 21, 2009, the
       RGC issued the Circular No. 697 to exempt renewable energy technologies and
       equipment, including SHS and bio-digesters, from import taxes.

   (b) Financing. The project provided an output-based grant of US$100 per system to
       encourage private companies to invest in and install 12,000 SHS among rural
       households. However, during implementation, it became evident that rural
       households could not afford the upfront cost of SHSs (about US$300 each) to
       private companies. In order to remove this barrier identified during implementation,
       the OBA delivery modality was changed to “hire-and-purchase? as part of the 2010
       restructuring. The new approach attracted great interest from rural households as it
       allowed them to finance the cost of SHS over time, with terms up to 48 months.
       Although installation started two years behind schedule, the installation of 12,000
       SHS was eventually completed in less than six months. The new delivery
       mechanism made it possible for households to obtain SHS, thereby removing
       barriers to rural households to access renewable energy.

   (c) Outreach and information sharing. The project supported the Promotion of
       Renewable Energy Technologies. The promotion campaign was carried out through
       booklets, posters and signage, TV and radio spots geared mainly toward the private
       sector and financing institutions and local banks. The project also supported public
       consultations (see photo 18) with HHs on benefits of SHS, including subsidies
       available, cost savings, convenience and improved security by switching from
       kerosene lamps. The outreach efforts generated strong interest among rural
       households.

   (d) Institutional capacity improvement. The project supported managerial, technical
       procurement oversight, and M&E by the IAs, in order to enhance their capacity to
       effectively perform their responsibilities well beyond project closing. The project
       also financed capacity building of financial institutions and REEs. It contributed to


                                            15
          improving the understanding of renewable energy technologies, the business, and
          enhanced their skills to appraise and supervise such projects. By closing date, some
          122 trainees participated in renewable energy business development, 229
          participated in capacity building for financial institutions, and 60 REE
          representatives participated in renewable energy promotion training sessions.

Percentage of national generation capacity by renewable energy systems increased. By
project closing date, installed hydropower generation capacity reached 14.5%6 of the total
installed capacity in the country compared to 5% renewable energy capacity targeted.
Although the project did not directly finance renewable energy projects, it did fund the
update of the Power Master Plan and construct partial power evacuation route that
connected to the Kamchay hydropower plant which indirectly contributed to this success.
This hydropower plant was connected to the national grid in December 2011.

In the case of SHS subcomponent, although there were challenges encountered in
implementation, the bulk purchase scheme for SHS was ultimately successful. However,
the performance of this subcomponent is rated moderately satisfactory, since the SHS
installation was not fully completed at Credit closing due to delays in procurement.

On the other hand, the planned installation of micro hydropower capacity of 1,200 kW as
approved during the 2010 restructuring could not be completed, as the feasibility study of
the five selected sites concluded they were not economically or financially viable. However,
this had little impact on achievement of the targets for reducing Greenhouse Gas emissions.
Based on data provided by EDC, as of December 2011, carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions
directly and indirectly avoided through the project – through provision of SHS to new
households, improved power system efficiency, loss reduction, import of electricity from
Vietnam, replacement of small inefficient diesel generators with grid supply, and domestic
hydropower financed through other sources – reached more than 511,000 tons, greatly
exceeding the 233,000 tons targeted for the project period. The estimated CO2 emission to
be directly avoided by the Project over by 2020 is estimated about 2 million tons –
exceeding even the combined direct and indirect target for avoided CO2 emission of 1.5
million tons. (See Table B of Annex 2.)

The target for the other key performance indicator for the GEO, “increase of local
commercial lending and other financing for rural electrification and renewable energy
development? US$ 15 million was not achieved. This is mostly because local financing for
rural electrification and renewable energy was not available due to external factors such as
the financing environment not being conducive to lending to REEs, and the unwillingness
of local commercial banks to lend for rural electrification and renewable energy.
Nevertheless, EDC still was able to access financing from bilateral or multilateral agencies
and other sources notably the China Export Import Bank, which contributed US$50 million
equivalent for investment in the distribution network.

The GEO rating was downgraded to “unsatisfactory? in November 2010 as the key
outcome indicator supporting the GEO – installation of 12,000 SHS – was not on track as
closing approached. Following the adoption of the new delivery model, REF successfully
concluded procurement by signing a contract with a supplier in May 2011, and a contract

         It counts only 10MW supplied by the Kamchay hydropower plant by December 2011. Total capacity of Kamchay
hydropower plant is 193MW

for the supervision of SHS installation in September 2011. By December 2011, some 9,875
SHS had been installed. (The remarkable progress can be observed in the sharp upturn in
the disbursement curve in the datasheet.) In light of the rapid progress of key outcome
indicator supporting the GEO in the second half of 2011, (beside quick installation of SHS
in second half of 2011, the increase financing for RE from null in 2010 to US$ 50 million
in 2011, and increase percentage of national generation capacity by renewable energy from
2.3% in 2010 to 14.5% in 2011), the GEO rating was upgraded to "moderately satisfactory"
during the implementation support mission from December 12-22, 2011. The upgraded
“moderately satisfactory? GEO rating was reported in ISR sequence #13 on January 18,
2012. Because it was archived on February 10, 2012 (after closing date) the last ISR in the
system still shows a GEO rating of unsatisfactory.

3.3 Efficiency

Rating: Moderately Satisfactory

Economic and financial analyses were carried out for different components of the project:
(i) grid extension under EDC; (ii) grant-assisted household connections under REEs; and
(iii) the installation of SHS under REF. The main findings and conclusions are
summarized below, and further detail is available in Annex 3.

The Economic Internal Rate of Return (EIRR) of the grid extension sub-component under
EDC is 28.9% compared with 19.8% at appraisal; the Financial Internal Rate of Return
(FIRR) of the subcomponent is 7.3% compared with 4.4% at appraisal; and the Financial
Net Present Value (FNPV) is US$4.9 million compared with a negative US$ 1.3 million at
appraisal. The higher economic return is primarily due to the higher consumer willingness-
to-pay estimate based on the actual weighted average tariff off-grid households in the
project area paid in 2008. At appraisal, the willingness-to-pay estimate was based on the
average cost of off-grid supply in 2003 when fuel prices were substantially lower. The
higher financial return is primarily due to higher than estimated retail tariff in the project
area.

Note: NPV- Net Present Value; EOCK - Economic Opportunity Cost of Capital; WACC - Weighted
Average Cost of Capital

The EIRR of the Grant-supported household connections by REEs is estimated at 17.5%
compared with 22.3% at appraisal; the NPV of the subcomponent is estimated at US$ 8.9
million compared with US$ 9.6 million at appraisal. The FIRR of the subcomponent is
estimated at 9.8% compared with 22.2% at appraisal and the FNPV is estimated at
US$ 10.5 million compared with US$ 4.3 million at appraisal. The lower EIRR and FIRR
are primarily due to higher costs of supply from diesel based generation. The higher NPV
and FNPV in spite of the lower EIRR and FIRR are due to an additional 5,000 households
being connected compared with the original plan.

No economic and financial analyses were conducted for the SHS program at appraisal. At
completion, the economic analysis of the SHS pilot first assessed the economic return of
the subcomponent, and then estimated the levelized cost of electricity to end users under
the following three scenarios: (i) Scenario 1 without interest free financing, all capital costs
paid up front; (ii) Scenario 2 with interest free financing; and (iii) Scenario 3 with interest
free financing and $100 subsidy per household.

The analysis shows that the levelized cost of electricity from SHS is highly sensitive to
under-utilization. For example, with four hours of usage per day, the 50 WP and 30 WP
systems deliver electricity at around US$ 0.75 per kWh and US$ 1.00 per kWh; the cost
will double if the system is used for only two hours a day.
Financial Performance of EDC

Assessment of the financial viability of EDC at appraisal highlighted several issues:
insufficient tariff to recover costs of supply; high costs of production; outstanding
government arrears; and high distribution losses. Based on the assumptions made, the
financial projections for the period 2001-10 indicated that EDC’s financial outlook would
remain fragile unless the following measures were taken: (i) procuring fuel on the basis of
competitive bids; (ii) converting one of its power plants to cheaper fuels; (iii) negotiating
with IPPs for lower tariffs and reduced level of off-take; (iv) reducing staffing costs; (v)
shutting down older plants to reduce O&M costs; vi) reducing system losses; and (vii)
updating the company’s bad debt provisions and write-offs.

To promote continued prudent financial management, the following financial covenants
were agreed as well at appraisal: (a) sufficient cash flow to cover operating expenses and
the amount by which debt service requirements exceed the provision for depreciation; (b)
debt service coverage ratio no less than 1.3 times from 2007 onward; and (c) long-term
debt to equity ratio less than 1.5 times. All covenants were met, except for the break-even
covenant in 2007 when EDC’s cost of supply was around KH Riel 1,012 per kWh and the
average tariff around KH Riel 996 per kWh. In that year, the Cambodia Utility Private
Limited provided EDC with a Riel 54 million refund for liquidated damages, which helped
make up for the shortfall in the company’s cash flow.

3.4 Justification of Overall Outcome and Global Environment Outcome Rating

Rating: Moderately Satisfactory
The project remained highly relevant to RGC’s priorities from concept review in 2000 to
closing in 2012. All major physical targets achieved or exceeded as well as the target for
CO2 emission reduction albeit with cumulative extensions of 31 months. Achievement of

                                              18
the PDO, GEO and efficiency are rated moderately satisfactory. Therefore, the overall
rating is justifiably moderately satisfactory.

3.5 Overarching Themes, Other Outcomes and Impacts

(a) Poverty Impacts, Gender Aspects, and Social Development
As a result of the project, some 565,733 rural residents (52% female) now have either grid-
supplied or off-grid electricity services for the first time. Although no detailed impact
survey was carried out, certain impacts are apparent: (a) rural households now have access
to safer, better lighting (compared kerosene lamps) for students to do homework at night,
for socializing or for watching television; (b) households have started home businesses that
can potentially increase incomes; and (c) 174 primary, secondary and high schools, over
200 houses of worship, and 132 health centers and hospitals now offer better services.
Gender. It is commonplace for all housework in rural areas – including collection of
drinking water, preparation of meals and rice husking – to be carried out by female
household members. Anecdotal information gathered during site visits indicated that the
physical and time burden of these tasks has been significantly reduced in households with
electricity – consistent with findings of studies documenting similar experience in other
countries. For example, in visits, it was observed that villagers gaining access to electricity
have obtained electric water pumps near their homes, thus reducing time and energy spent
fetching water, and some families are using electricity for cooking and boiling water.
Females feel safer in the evening, with electric lighting and feel better positioned in the
family since they can work in the evening on household businesses such as weaving to
increase incomes..
(b) Institutional Change/Strengthening
Implementation Support for Creation of REF. The creation of REF provided an important
instrument for delivering subsidies and providing off-grid electrification to targeted
households in rural areas that could not be reached by the grid in the medium term. This
provided an important complement to grid extension by EDC and REEs. The
implementation capacity of the REF Secretariat was developed on technical aspects,
procurement oversight, supporting REE development, and M&E. About 135 sub-grants to
95 REEs were evaluated and appraised by REF staff, and with the support of the TA, REF
staff successfully managed the SHS program. The knowledge obtained will help REF
perform similar tasks after closing, provided continued support is available to implement
and revise the REF strategic plan as needed.
Capacity Building for REE and Support for the Establishment of a REE Association.
Through capacity building to REEs, the project contributed to enhancing their ability to
further expand electricity access in rural areas, complementing EDC’s efforts. The project
helped REEs organize themselves to communicate effectively with RGC and relevant
organizations (local commercial banks) to accrue more benefits, and to assist one another
with technical and financial challenges. As part of the TA, a road map was prepared for
REE improvement, and a strategic plan was developed for strengthening the REE
association in order to build long-term capacity. In addition to sub-grants to REEs, the
project fostered private sector participation in the power sector through training on
technical and financial management of the energy enterprises.
Strengthening of EAC Institutional Capacity. The Project strengthened EAC’s capacity
to carry out its responsibilities mandated in the Electricity Law and helped put in place
regulations and codes to improve the quality of the supply and services and to ensure
transparency in EAC’s operations. To date, all 11 required Regulations and Codes were
issued and are being used by EAC, except for the “Distribution Codes? which are being
finalized. With these Regulations and Codes in place, EAC issued licenses to 297 REEs,


                                              19
exceeding the original target of 180, which was facilitated by the extension of the closing
date. Continued capacity building was provided to EAC through various training programs
on technical and financial regulations. The success of the capacity building was
demonstrated when EAC was able to reduce the services of the in-house advisor (financed
by its own funds) from full time to an as-needed basis.
EDC Institutional Capacity Strengthened. The project enhanced EDC’s capacity
significantly in the areas of:
        (a) Commercial practices and management by installing and providing training on
        FAUMIS, first at its head office, and then at provincial branch offices;
        (b) Power investment planning by helping EDC to identify and estimate system
        loads, assess and reduce losses, ensure reliability and quality of existing supplies,
        develop a plan for the 22 kV backbone system, evaluate existing substations and
        existing 22 kV and LV network and rehabilitation requirements. EDC’s technical
        staff were provided with and trained for use of planning software and load
        monitoring tools and other related items in preparing EDC’s power investment plan.
        These skills can be used for future power investment planning; and
        (c) Project implementation. The project enhanced the capacity of EDC in
        procurement, contract management and site supervision for transmission and
        distribution projects, and associated environmental and social safeguards
        management.
In addition, a project grievance mechanism established a committee to address safeguards
related issues. Safeguards training sessions to enhance the capacity of this committee’s
members and the staff of SEU were carried out under the ADB parallel financing for RETP.
Nevertheless, EDC’s SEU staff also received rounds of training on World Bank safeguards
policies. As a testament to SEU’s enhanced capacity, RGC delegated to SEU all land
acquisition and compensation tasks for EDC projects.
MIME. Some 27 MIME staff benefited directly or indirectly from the project. They
obtained knowledge on energy policy/strategy formulation; however, they still need
external support for comprehensive studies and or strategy formulation.
(c) Other Unintended Outcomes and Impacts (positive or negative)

3.6 Summary of Findings of Beneficiary Survey and/or Stakeholder Workshops
A half-day stakeholder workshop was organized on March 23, 2012. The workshop
provided an opportunity for primary and secondary beneficiaries to share project outputs
and outcomes, challenges, lessons learned and to express their views and recommendations
for better project preparation and implementation. Secondary beneficiaries (officials of
MIME, EAC, EDC and REF), consultants, contractors and ADB representatives attended
the workshop. A list of participants, a power point presentation and a summary of
workshop proceedings are shown in Annex 6.

4. Assessment of Risk to Development Outcome and Global Environment Outcome

Rating: Significant
Risks to Power Sector Efficiency and Reliability
 Reliability of power demand growth forecast. At appraisal, the annual electricity
   demand growth rate was estimated at about 13% between 2003 and 2008 and beyond.
   However, the growth rate of electricity generation and purchases surged to 25% in 2007
   and an additional 23% in 2010 to meet power demand. Higher than expected demand
   growth could put reliability of the power supply at risk, potentially reversing efficiency

                                             20
   improvements.. In order to maintain power sector efficiency and reliability it will be
   important to accurately forecast power demand and make commensurate investments.
   Risk is rated “moderate?.
 Imports from Vietnam. It was expected that from 2008 onwards, up to 200 MW would
   be imported from Vietnam, based on the 2005 PPA. However, due to a surge in
   domestic power demand, Vietnam was unable to export as much power as expected.
   Currently, Vietnam sells Cambodia around 135MW of power, and this is unlikely to
   increase in the coming years. Therefore, the risk to improving power sector efficiency
   and reliability from imports is rated “significant?.
Risks to Cost Reduction
 Purchased power from neighboring countries. EDC’s total electricity supply in 2011
   was about 2,564 GWh, of which 1,662 GWh (65%) was imported from its neighbors.
   However, Vietnam’s inability to supply the expected amount of energy negatively
   impacts EDC’s efforts to reduce its supply costs. As the quantity of energy that will be
   available for import from Vietnam is not certain, and the possibility of an increase in
   the tariff for energy is being explored, the risk to cost reduction is “significant?.
 Cost competitiveness of new independently owned generation capacity. Currently,
   domestic IPPs’ share in EDC’s energy mix is about 900 GWh (35%) (fuel oil, coal,
   hydropower) and most of PPAs solicited with IPPs are only modestly cost-competitive
   at best. If solicitation of independently owned power generation does not involve
   adequate competition among IPPs, there is a significant risk of inability to reduce
   power supply costs.
 Limited cost reduction opportunities offered by domestic hydropower plants. The
   domestic supply is expected to significantly increase in the short term (2012 to2015),
   with the completion of a series of hydropower plants with a total installed capacity of
   about 800 MW. (The current supply capacity of EDC including international purchases
   is about 620 MW.) With this additional supply, it is generally expected that the supply
   cost of EDC will decline drastically. However, with the average generation cost at
   hydropower power plants of about US$0.070/kWh (excluding VAT), the average cost
   of EDC supply for the end-user is estimated at about US$0.128/kWh. Regardless of the
   increased capacity of domestic hydropower, the risk to cost reduction remains
   “significant?. (See Annex 3)
 Cost of REE in providing off-grid electricity services. Complementing EDC, REEs are
   extending electricity connections and providing services to rural consumers. Out of 297
   licensed REEs, about 155 REEs have connected to EDC grids throughout the country.
   Tariffs for REEs that connected to EDC’s grid declined remarkably from KH Riel
   2,800-3,000/kWh (US$0.68-0.730/kWh) to KH Riel 1,100-1,700/kWh (US$0.26 –
   0.41/kWh). The average REE retail tariff (off-grid tariff) is US$0.51/kWh, which is
   even higher than the baseline tariff of US$0.5kWh. Even with current international oil
   prices, the average REE retail tariff can be reduced to below target if most REEs
   connect to EDC’s grid and the bulk purchase tariff charged by EDC is reasonably
   regulated targeting lowering down retail tariff. However, the prospect of getting most
   REEs to connect is very slim as REEs are facing technical and financial constraints, and
   EDC has its own challenges as described above. Risk to reducing cost of REEs and
   subsequently the average off-grid tariffs is “significant?.
Risks to Expansion of Access to Modern Energy Services

Rating: Significant
Sustainability of REF. REF has been successful in attracting grants and securing support
of donors and government and in achieving off-grid electrification targets. Retaining and
improving the governance of the REF and other institutions in the rural electrification

                                            21
business is critical for continued support from RGC and donors to realize RGC’s targets.
On December 8, 2011 the REF Board and MIME decided to merge REF and its Secretariat
with the EDC to support REF operations after project completion due to REF’s perceived
vulnerability in sustaining its functions due to budget shortfalls.
The decision to merge REF and its Secretariat with the EDC would compromise REF’s
governance system and may jeopardize the off-grid electrification progress. So far REF is
the only instrument for providing off-grid electrification to unserved households in the
country. It is of paramount importance to retain REF’s current autonomous status, in order
to enable REF to complement the efforts of EDC and REEs, and mobilize resources to
provide affordable off-grid electricity services to unserved households that are unlikely to
be connected to the national grid on a commercial basis in the medium term. RGC’s
commitment to allocating sufficient budget to REF in 2016 and beyond and retaining
REF’s current status is critical. Hence risk to expanding rural electricity supplies and
renewable energy is “significant?.
EDC ability to expand supply, while maintaining sustainability. EDC’s financial
performance is a major factor to measure its management performance, while expansion of
access is not taken into account. Various donors provided financing to EDC on
concessionary terms and EDC used it for major upgrades to improve its financial
performance. EDC has undertaken limited LV line stringing and delivers rural household
connections only when it expected a return on its investment. It is understandable that EDC
is unwilling to expand distribution networks in remote rural areas—anticipating increased
system losses—without sufficient subsidies to recover its cost of supply. Therefore, EDC’s
pace of connecting rural households has been very slow. The pace of expansion is likely to
remain sluggish unless more favorable conditions are put in place, such as providing grant
support, transferring capital to EDC specifically for rural electrification, and revisiting
EDC’s retail tariff covering rural areas, to allow EDC to recover cost and achieve a
reasonable return on its assets. In light of the above, the risk to future expansion of the rural
electricity supply is rated as “significant?.
SHS installation and sustainability. Despite public awareness programs organized for SHS
users on the benefits, constraints, and appropriate O&M, some households are using their
systems improperly. Such practices could negatively affect the durability of the SHS and
cause wide-spread SHS inefficiency which could prove detrimental to the SHS market.
Another risk for scaling up the use of SHS is the subsidy itself – the households are
receiving SHSs below market price. To continue expanding the SHS in remote areas, RGC
should consider a similar subsidy regime to allow private companies to supply SHS to rural
households. Without such subsidy, the risk of increasing access through SHS installation is
“significant?.
Risks to sustainability of enabling environment for renewable energy
Involvement of financial institutions in the power sector. The “enabling environment? for
private participation in the power sector can be assured only with the active participation of
local commercial banks or financial institutions. An environment conducive to private
sector participation would be predicated on: (a) a transition strategy for supporting
renewable energy lending, through a mechanism aimed at mitigating the unwillingness of
commercial banks to provide favorable lending rates for REEs/IPPs possibly through the
provision of loan guarantees, or offering concessional financing to “buy down? the cost of
the financing; (b) a predictable policy and regulatory environment; and (c) continued TA to
REEs and commercial financial institutions. If these elements are not in place, the risk to
the sustainability of the enabling environment for renewable energy would be
“significant?.

5. Assessment of Bank and Borrower Performance

5.1 Bank Performance

(a) Bank Performance in Ensuring Quality at Entry

Rating: Moderately Satisfactory

During preparation, the Bank carefully reviewed RGC’s strategy, laws and other relevant
documents pertaining to the energy sector and renewable energy in particular. The Bank
team carried out studies, and supported the client to perform its own analyses, to ensure the
preparation of a good quality project. The team also reviewed lessons learned from rural
energy projects in other countries and designed implementation arrangements that were
client appropriate and consistent with Bank policy. The team mobilized much needed
financial resources to help the client prepare the Project. For example, upon the client’s
request, the Bank processed an advance of US$290,840 from the Project Preparation
Facility. The Bank team comprised a well-rounded mix of skills and expertise on policy,
technical, financial and implementation aspects of rural electrification, and the team was
supported by international expert consultants as needed. Project preparation stretched
between 2000 and 2004, using about 140 staff weeks and costing just over $806,000.

On the other hand, some aspects of project preparation could have been stronger,
particularly those under the REF pilot, especially the absence of bankable renewable
energy projects, and associated issues with mobilization of commercial financing for those
projects, and the affordability of the payment terms for SHS, which were all critical factors
for success of those components.

The Bank helped the client prepare a technically sound rural electrification and
transmission project, based on good technical knowledge and reflecting good international
practices of the time, while addressing the government’s priorities for the sector.
Nonetheless, the Bank’s performance in ensuring quality at entry is rated moderately
satisfactory, to reflect the weaknesses in the initial background and risk analysis, as
summarized here and discussed in detail in Section 2.2, and the mismatch between the
project activities and the results framework, as discussed in Section 2.4.

(b) Quality of Supervision
Rating: Moderately Satisfactory

The Bank actively and effectively supervised this project and provided advice on
implementation problems as they arose. At least 13 implementation support missions, as
well as an MTR mission were undertaken by the Bank. Timely guidance and advice were
provided for corrective actions when needed to ensure achievement of the PDOs, including
restructuring of the project in 2010, realignment of the GEF technical assistance component
to meet changing needs and refining project delivery modalities. A number of field visits
were undertaken to ensure compliance with safeguards policies, and to verify physical
progress and achievements. As of 2007, most of the project core team was field based, with
the team leader moving from Washington to the field, which allowed for continual
implementation support outside formal missions. Some examples of cases when the Bank
provided effective implementation support are summarized below. (Further details are in
Sections 2.2 and 2.4.)

   Project management. In moving from approval and effectiveness, the Bank team
    closely monitored the resolution of delays in the formation of the new government and
    the signing of the legal agreements. In the intervening period, the Bank worked closely

                                             23
    with the ADB and helped the IAs finalize a joint RAP which was disclosed in late
    January 2005, thus meeting a condition of effectiveness.
   Safeguards. In the case of the PAP complaints, the Bank team took immediate action to
    work with EDC, providing guidance on the required procedures, advising them to halt
    construction immediately, and closely cooperating with the EDC on oversight of
    implementation remedial actions. This enabled the satisfactory resolution of these
    issues in a very short period.
   Financial management. Issues over REF governance were identified by the Bank in a
    timely manner, and the Bank immediately worked with RGC counterparts to provide
    guidance and support to address the issue, including the adoption of mitigation
    measures and remedial time-bound actions for REF to address the issue.
   Procurement. Following identification of concerns with procurement under projects
    unrelated to RETP, the Bank, in mutual agreement with the Borrower, supported the
    engagement of IPA to handle procurement and helped IAs prepare GGF for the project.
    Moreover, when there was a procurement complaint under an EDC activity, guidance
    provided to EDC was proactive, timely and effective, with successful conclusion of all
    procurement complaints.
   Fine tuning project design. The need for revising the SHS delivery model and the
    mini/micro hydropower targets were identified during MTR in May 2008 and Bank’s
    advice on a revised model was critical for REF to turn the failing SHS program around,
    and make it a success in a very short period.
On the other hand, a key shortcoming of Bank supervision was that the Bank task team did not
seize the opportunity of the MTR or the 2010 restructuring to address the weaknesses of the
project results, framework, and revise certain indicators such as those beyond control of the
project.
In light of the above, Bank performance during supervision is rated as Moderately
Satisfactory.
(c) Justification of Rating for Overall Bank Performance
Considering the “moderately satisfactory? rating of Bank performance in ensuring quality
entry and supervision, the overall Bank performance is rated Moderately Satisfactory.

5.2 Borrower Performance

(a) Government Performance

Rating: Moderately Satisfactory
As discussed in sections 1.1 and 2.1, the power sector in Cambodia underwent significant
changes during the project period. RGC demonstrated strong commitment to the power
sector by taking significant policy decisions, particularly with the passage of the Energy
Law in 2000, establishment of the EAC in 2001, finalization of the Energy Sector Strategy
and the Renewable Energy Strategy of 2003, and establishment of REF in 2005. At the
project level, RGC’s commitment during preparation was demonstrated by close
engagement and cooperation, as well as by its willingness to request a PPF advance to
finance project preparation. During implementation, RGC’s commitment to the sector, and
achievement of outcomes continued, despite the various challenges faced. The remarkable
increase in the number of licensed REEs in the rural energy program underlines the
relevance and implementation effectiveness of the rural energy policy set by MIME and the
regulatory oversight of REEs by EAC.



                                             24
On the downside, as a result of long delays in the formation of a new government, it took
four-and-a-half months for RGC to fulfill the conditions of effectiveness. Delays were
caused by prolonged finalization of the PIP and appointment of staff in order to complete
the set-up and staffing arrangements of the PMUs. The performance of MIME, as the line
ministry in the energy sector in charge of setting policy for the sector, was moderately
satisfactory. Limitations in MIME’s procurement capacity led to delays in engaging
consultants to support the preparation of select strategies and implementation plans. This
delay, in turn, had a negative effect on the quality of the studies, which were completed just
before closing, missing the opportunity to seek potentially valuable inputs from
stakeholders to improve relevance, build ownership, and implement some key
recommendations.
(b) Implementing Agencies’ Performance

Rating: Moderately Satisfactory

Performance of EAC is rated satisfactory. EAC management closely oversaw
implementation with strong support of an international advisor. With the knowledge and
skills obtained as a result of the project’s institutional strengthening support, EAC licensed
297 REEs, well surpassing the target of licensing 180 REEs.

Performance of EDC is rated moderately satisfactory.                EDC’s performance in
implementing the project investments is rated satisfactory as all the relevant intermediate
indicators were achieved. EDC was proactive and effective in implementing its investment
activities. Of particular note is the company’s outreach for its network extensions and new
connections, as the company carried out door-to-door consultations, setting up an on-site
mobile office to take applications from households, and helped people sign up for
connections on the spot. However, two factors negatively influenced EDC’s performance
rating. First, the procurement delays in NCC installation were a key contributor to the need
for an extension of the closing date. Second, EDC showed weakness in social safeguard
management when it allowed contractors to start construction prior to full compensation
which resulted in PAP complaints in 2008. Under TA activities, EDC relied heavily on
consultants to oversee project implementation and made only modest efforts to regularly
manage the project.

Performance of REF is rated moderately satisfactory. Performance of this newly
established institution was marked with both noteworthy achievements and shortcomings.
In terms of accomplishments, despite being fully operational only starting April 2007, REF
was able to: (i) review and appraise 135 applications submitted by REEs for off-grid sub-
grants for connection to 50,000 new households, (ii) conduct prior consultations with SHS
households, (iii) oversee installation of SHS and get the “hire and purchase? agreements
signed by households, (iv) inspect and issue acceptance certificates; and (v) collect
payments from SHS beneficiaries. On the other hand, there were two instances of suspected
fraud during implementation per Section 2.4. Resolution of these concerns caused delays in
processing the restructuring. With guidance from the Bank team, REF took satisfactory
corrective actions outlined in a time-bound mitigation action plan to improve internal
controls on financial management. In light of the above, the overall performance rating of
the Implementing Agencies (EAC, EDC and REF) is moderately satisfactory.

(c) Justification of Rating for Overall Borrower Performance
Rating: Moderately Satisfactory

As the performances of both RGC and the implementing agencies are rated moderately
satisfactory, the Borrower’s overall performance is moderately satisfactory.

6. Lessons Learned
The main lessons learned are presented below.
A well designed M&E framework is essential for properly assessing the real
achievements of a project, and garnering support for replication and future scale-up. A
misalignment between a project’s activities and its stated outcomes, which in turn, inform
the key performance indicators through which “success? is measured, can make a well-
performing project appear less successful. In the case of RETP, indicators such as
improved power sector efficiency, increased local financing, or reduced power supply costs
measured progress in the entire sector, instead of focusing on outcomes for a specific
intervention. Sector-level goals are affected by many factors far beyond the reach of a
single project, and are better pursued and measured through a series of interventions.
Furthermore, setting PDO-level indicators reflecting factors not directly targeted by any
project activity, or which received very modest support, should be avoided. The evaluation
of project outcomes purely through the perspective of sector-wide goals could end up
overshadowing the project’s accomplishments, could prevent the replication of the
successful approaches the project included.
In order to make private sector investments happen in renewable energy in rural areas,
the basic policy and regulatory enabling environment should be complemented with
carefully designed and well targeted financing support, technical assistance and capacity
building. Experience under RETP suggests that the enabling environment for private sector
investment in renewable energy in rural areas, particularly with regard to access to
financing and technical support is critical. Fundamental components of the enabling
environment include straightforward and non-time consuming technical and environmental
clearance and permitting procedures, as well as simple, transparent and predictable
regulatory requirements. In addition, decision-makers should equip key sector participants
– particularly developers, financing institutions, permitting bodies, and regulatory entities –
with the necessary resources, tools and skills to understand, identify, appraise, invest and
finance renewable energy projects for rural electrification. In some cases, even with all
these essentials, small-scale renewable energy projects might not be able to attract
international investors, while local private developers may not have the capacity to handle
the upstream risks of project identification and preparation. Small renewable energy
development stands to benefit from identification and preparation of a batch of bankable
projects, in order to attract private investment. Encouraging commercial banks to develop
product lines able to address the specific challenges associated with renewable energy
business, including flexible terms and appropriate repayment schemes, can be very useful.
At least initially, until a significant demand base can be built up, expansion of electricity
access to rural areas may not be based purely on commercial principles. In order to allow
service providers to deliver new connections and ensure sustainability and affordability of
continued service for rural consumers, service providers should be allowed to recover their
costs through a combination of tariffs and government support in the form of concessional
debt financing, grants, and subsidies.
Customized support for developing, scaling up and sustaining productive uses is highly
likely to make a significant impact on the feasibility and viability of rural electrification
investments. EDC and REF dedicated special attention to engaging the owners of
commercial and manufacturing businesses to abandon self-generation facilities and connect
to their systems. These efforts were complemented by TA for the development of
additional productive uses of electricity. This combination successfully built the necessary
consumer base to make the network investments viable. Support to productive use of
electricity helped build up demand, and led to increased use and efficiency of the existing
assets of REEs and EDC; this resulted in increased revenues for REEs and EDC and helped
improve affordability of electricity for local consumers. RETP experience also showed that
the availability of favorable financing to local business owners for productive uses was a
very useful complement in ensuring the success.

                                              26
In designing SHS programs for rural areas, the choice of appropriate system sizes based
on robust upfront analysis, suitable delivery approaches, and post-installation operation
and maintenance arrangements is likely to have a significant bearing on the efficiency,
cost effectiveness, and sustainability of those programs. The original SHS delivery
approach under RETP attracted little market response, as rural households could not afford
to pay the up-front charges to the dealers and the dealers were not successful in marketing
and delivery due to limitations to their capacity and resources. The revised delivery model
resulted in (i) the realization of the installation target for the whole project in a period of
ten months; (ii) better, though not perfect, matching of households’ needs, through the bulk
purchase of two different sizes of SHS; (iii) resolution of the affordability issues, firstly
through the cost reductions resulting from bulk purchase of systems through ICB, and
secondly, by allowing households to make monthly repayments for the systems; and (iv)
greater chance of sustainability of post-installation operation of the systems, through the
hiring of international contractors through competitive bidding for supplying, delivering
and installating the SHS, as well as installation supervision and post-installation
maintenance. Even though post-installation sustainability is yet to be seen, since the SHS
installation was completed very recently, the RETP experience shows that an efficient,
effective and sustainable SHS program design is likely to combine: (i) selection of system
sizes appropriate for varying household needs, based on extensive surveys carried out at the
outset; (ii) procurement modalities that deliver efficiency and cost reductions; (iii)
implementing arrangements that assist households in overcoming affordability issues in an
environment of limited affordability and financing challenges, and (iv) arrangement that
allow for recovery of capital costs and working capital requirements through some other
channel than upfront user charges.

7. Comments on Issues Raised by Borrower/Implementing Agencies/Partners

(a) Borrower/implementing agencies

The Borrower and the IAs agreed with the content of this ICR. Their inputs7 and comments
are provided in Annex 7. Borrower comments were mainly editorial and issues raised on
implementation delays which cited in section 2.2 of the ICR. They confirmed it was
satisfaction with the clarification provided.

The borrower (ICR) cited that overall rating for achievement of the PDOs and the GEO of
the Project should be rated “satisfactory?. Owing thorough review and assessment in
section 3.2 above, the rating of PDO and GEO is maintained as “moderately satisfactory?

There was a borrow’ s view that to accommodate the needs of some households, who had
earlier purchased a system and required more power, the project should provide an addition
SHS to them. As this hire-and-purchase SHS scheme included a subsidy of US$100 per
system, the already installed households should not be given additional system.

The government acknowledged frequent power cut remains an issue in rural areas supplied
by REEs, some of them connected to EDC grids. They were in the same view that there is a
need to reduce REE tariff as to promote generation of rural income through use of
electricity.

II.      DETAILS OF SUBCOMPONENT OUTPUTS

  A.     COMPONENT A: THE TRANSMISSION LINE

  A-1         The Construction of 230 kV Transmission Line - interconnection to
              Vietnam
  The scope of this component included: a) the 230 kV TL portion in Cambodia, b) two new
  substations, at West Phnom Penh (WPP) and Takeo; and c) capacity building. (The 230
  kV portion of the system in Vietnam, comprising 98 km of 230 kV TL between the
  existing substation at That Not and Chau Doc was funded from an ongoing project.)
  The component was successfully completed following the original designs. The 220kV
  transmission component was fully financed by the ADB (together with financing from the
  Nordic Development Fund) under ADB’s Greater Mekong Sub-region Transmission
  Project. The detailed outputs and outcomes of this component will be included in the
  ADB’s Project Completion Report.

  A-2         The 115 kV TL and Substations and MV extensions at WPP and Takeo

  This component was aimed at addressing the urgent needs of the transmission system
  around Phnom Penh which is the major load centre, by undertaking: a) 115 kV network
  expansion around Phnom Penh, b) upgrading of 115 kV substations to accept these
  transmission lines and enhance their transformation and load discharge capacity; and c) as
  an integral package extend the MV network around the new substations West Phnom Penh
  (WPP) and Takeo to distribute the additional load. These components are discussed
  separately below.
          A-2-1 Reinforcement of 115 kV Transmission Lines
     The reinforcement of 115 kV TL included (a) 20 km of new 115 kV TL to connect the
     new WPP substation (financed by ADB) and grid substation-3 (GS3), and (b) stringing
     the second circuit of about 23 km of 115 kV conductors between the three existing grid
     substations. The sub-component was successfully completed. About 14 km of a double
     circuit transmission line were built instead of the planned 20 km due to routing changes
     of the power line and the line was completed in May 2009 or with about a one year
     delay due to land acquisition problems. The system has been in full operation since
     August 2009.
          A-2-2 Upgrading of 115 kV Substations
     The three substations were upgraded to improve reliability of supply for existing
     customers as well as improvement of transmission and distribution efficiency with
     reduction of system losses. This included switchyard extensions to accommodate
     additional switches for the new transmission lines, additional 115/22kV power
     transformers and reactive compensation to reduce losses and improve voltage
     regulation.
     The sub-component was successfully completed according to design. It provided items
     in the original scope of works for the rehabilitation of the three substations, and included
     the switchyard extension to accommodate the new 115 kV TLs, the new MV lines,
     additional power transformer capacity and capacitive compensation for loss reduction
     and voltage improvements.
     The project was effectively completed in August 2010 following three extensions from
     the original date of May 2009. The delays were mainly due to major equipment
     manufacturing changes and some changes in the materials which required approvals
     from the consultant, EDC and the World Bank. Minor items which were outstanding

                                                33
    concerned mainly SCADA/communication interfaces, which could not be completed
    until the SCADA system was installed and commissioned. This forced EDC not to sign
    the completion certificates to ensure good interface with the National Control Centre.
    The contract was finally declared complete with the commissioning of the SCADA
    system, on January 31, 2012.
        A-2-3 MV network expansion at WPP and Takeo (includes sub-component
              B1 – EDC’s RE Grid Extension)
    The scope included the installation of additional MV lines around the above substations
    to remove overloads on existing lines and enable the additional load to be distributed
    from the substations including new areas along roads No 3 and 4 at WPP and from
    Takeo to Samraong, and to Kampong Chrey.
    For project implementation efficiency this sub-component was combined with the EDC
    Rural Electrification Grid Extension subcomponent for procurement of materials and
    installation. The sub-component was successfully completed according.
    For the WPP and Takeo component, 168.8 km of new MV lines were built against a
    planned figure of 130 km which was completed in June 2011, almost two years beyond
    the original date. The installed MV lines for the rest of the areas totalled 448 km against
    a planned 516 km. In addition to the MV lines, some 656 km of LV lines were installed
    using EDC funds against a planned 536 km some 120 km (22%) more than the initially
    plans.
    Overall the installed system exceeded the initial plan, with the MV network being less
    and the LV more than planned. This is considered acceptable and expected with a live
    system.
    Details of MV and LV line installation by province are shown below.

                             TOTAL          612.82               656
    It was estimated that some 50,000 new consumers would be connected to the grid as a
    result of the system expansion. As of March 2012, it was reported that some 55,768 new
    consumers were connected vs 45,097 at closing. New connections occur daily as more
    consumers apply to be connected to the system in the electrified areas after the initial
    phase.

A-3          National Control Centre (NCC)

The introduction of a control centre was considered essential as the transmission system
develops and Cambodia’s system is interconnected with neighbouring countries. This sub-
component included the construction of a building to house the NCC and the purchase of a

        Financed by EDC’s budget
9
        Including underground cables



                                              34
SCADA system together with the data engineering for the system control, generation
scheduling and load dispatching.
The sub-component was successfully completed. Delays occurred due to slow procurement
and a change in location of the NCC building. This also resulted in additional requirements
for a fibre optic link between the initial location (substation GS2) which acted as the data
concentrator for the NCC and the current position.
Delays occurred with the construction of the building as EDC requested foundation
reinforcement for a multi-storey building with the view to build additional floors for
offices. This caused extensive contract change negotiations, and construction was delayed
another six months. The NCC – and SCADA system was installed and commissioned by
the closing date. All work was completed, except minor end-to-end testing between NCC
and a couple of remote terminal units at existing power generation plants. This part of
testing will eventually be completed by EDC staff.
B.     COMPONENT B: RURAL ELECTRIFICATION
B.1    EDC Grid Extension
This was discussed under item “A-2-3 MV network expansion at WPP and Takeo? above.
B.2    Warehouse to store RE Equipment and Materials - Restructured
This sub-component, which was designed to provide storage and management facilities for
materials procured for the rural electrification component. It was cancelled due to a
contractual problem and was financed by EDC instead.
C.     COMPONENT C: RURAL ELECTRIFICATION FUND
C.1     REE off-grid Extension
This subcomponent provided sub-grant assistance to REEs to facilitate the connection of
new households in rural areas. This encouraged the REEs to invest in and extend their
electric power facilities to provide new connections to the target of 50,000 new rural
households and to expand access to electricity in rural areas.
Some 135 subprojects/sub-grants were executed by 95 REEs in fifteen provinces and the
target number of 50,000 new connections was achieved. Delays in the establishment and
operationalization of the REF led to delays in issuing sub-grants to REEs, who depended
on the availability of cheap and easily accessible capital to expand further to rural areas.
The total disbursement amount of sub-grant was recorded as US$ 2.25 million for
connection to 50,000 new households in rural areas under REE’s coverage areas. See table
A of Annex 2.
C.2     Solar Home System (SHS)
This subcomponent was to provide renewable electricity to about 12,000 households using
SHS. It was envisaged to be implemented through existing SHS dealers, companies and
REEs with the use of a subsidy or grant (OBA) towards the cost of the SHS. However, as
of 2009, only 93 SHS had been installed, so the delivery mechanism was changed to bulk
purchase and installation under REF with customers being eligible to repay in instalments
over as long as four years. Once the delivery mechanism was changed, implementation
made tremendous progress and by the December 2011 closing date, 11,124 SHS had been
installed, with the remaining 876 installed within a month of closing. The final number
installed rose to 12,093. The SHS scheme included a consultant who supervised the
installation and who will provide maintenance support and collect loan instalment
payments after closing.

C.3 & C4       Mini Hydro and Village Hydro
These sub-components were to support the development of several mini hydro schemes by
the private sector through OBA. Despite little interest from the market since the RGC need
to develop a model for private participation in mini-micro hydropower, the sub-
components were restructured in 2010 to include the preparation of the relevant feasibility
studies and construction of 1,200 kW . The feasibility studies concluded that the hydro
schemes for the selected sites were not feasible under the current tariff and legal
framework, and detailed engineering was not recommended and the construction of 1,200
kW could not started. Hence the balance of this component was cancelled.
C.5 REF Office building (new activity added during restructuring)
The activity was added during the restructuring to support sustainability of REF by
removing office rental costs, which could then be use for rural electrification expansion or
provision of renewable energy (SHS) to rural households.
Work was fully completed by project closing date, i.e., in less than six months, following
concerted efforts of all involved. The activity was considered a major success showing that
it is possible to undertake demanding tasks with close collaboration of the relevant
stakeholders.

D.1.1 Renewable Energy Policy Development: to develop policy that would create a level
playing field for renewable energy private sector investors based on renewable energy
assessments and least cost planning. As agreed, international consultant services were
engaged to support MIME in developing a set of power sector policies and strategies such
as (a) Rural Energy Strategy and Implementation Plan (RESIP); (b) Renewable Energy
Policy/development program; and (c) Wood and Biomass Energy Strategy. These policies
and strategy were prepared and serve as platform for renewable energy development in
Cambodia.
D1.2 Development of a Power Master Plan: TA complemented the assistance provided by
JICA and Australia in the fields of RE master planning and energy consumption
forecasting. The TA (a) surveyed energy consumption in provincial and rural areas to serve
as a baseline survey of areas to be included in the grid extension component; and (b)
prepared a power system expansion master plan including generation additions,
transmission and distribution expansion, and zoning of grid versus off-grid areas. The
Power Master Plan was prepared in 2006 and guided development of a series of generation
plants (hydro and coal-fired power plants) and back-bone high voltage transmission lines.
The TA component also provided face-to-face training to MIME staff on the following
subjects: (i) Strategic Management; (ii) Project Management; (iii) Human Resource
Management; (iv) Marketing Management; (vi) Managerial Economics; (vii) Financial
Management; (viii) International Finance; (ix) Corporate Finance; (x) Auditing and
Accounting Practices; and (xi) English language training. Staff members are able to lead
the sector policy review, however they still need support for comprehensive studies and or
strategy formulation.
D.2    TA to REF
The TA component to REF included:
D.2.1 Implementation Support for creation of REF: REF established and fully operational
since 2007.


                                            36
D.2.2 Rural Income Generation Promotion promoted productive use of electricity for rural
income generation, which was completed in December 2011. It directly benefited about
1,200 villagers, who are business owners, prospective business owners, and other villagers.
D.2.3.a. Renewable Energy Business Development (SHS, renewable project and mini hydro
implementation support for REF). Deliverables included (a) Biomass Review Reports, (b)
Biomass Business Plan and Models, (c) SHS review Reports, (d) SHS Program Business
Plan and Models. However, the FS on mini hydropower concluded that sites chosen for the
study were non-feasible or not bankable projects, so no further study was undertaken.
D.2.3.b. Promotion of Renewable Energy Technologies: Promotion campaign was done by
booklets, posters and signage, TV and radio spots geared mainly toward the private sector
and financing institutions and local banks.
D.2.4a REE Improvement/ Training: A series of basic and advanced training on technical
and financial aspects were provided to REEs especially those receiving sub-grants from
REF. As result, most REEs that received training are better at managing their businesses
and losses have been reduced.
D.2.4b REE Association Building: This TA helped finalize REE association’s operational
procedures, road map and other documents. The association benefited from the TA by
establishing networks and contacts to help themselves.
D.2.5. Capacity building of financial institutions and REEs. The TA was to improve the
understanding of the renewable energy technology, business, and increase the appraisal and
supervision ability of the financial institutions.
SHS Installation Supervision, Maintenance and Collection of Payment (new activities):
This activity helped REF supervise the SHS installation process, perform maintenance
services (after the warranty period) and collect payments made by SHS beneficiaries for the
entire four year period. Before SHS installation began, the supervision consultant: (a)
undertook public consultations on the new SHS arrangements, roles and responsibilities of
REF, the suppliers, the consultancy services and the users; (b) engaged the households to
sign the hire-to-purchase agreement, a copy of which is retained by each household, and
collected the first payment for REF. After installation, the consultant performed payment-
cum- maintenance services every two months. The TA was regarded as successful resulting
in fast SHS installation and timely collection of repayments.
REF office design and construction supervision service (new activity): This successfully
helped REF to design its new office building and supervised its construction.
Study on REF sustainability (new activity): This TA helped REF take stock of REF
operations and proposed options to sustain REF’s operations after completion of the
project. The options were presented to REF’s Board in December 2011. The Board decided
to merge REF with EDC.
D.3    TA to EAC
The TA would strengthen EAC’s capacity to discharge its responsibilities mandated in the
Electricity Law, and have regulations and codes in place to improve the quality of the
supply and services and to ensure transparency in EAC’s operations. The TA included:
D3-1 Operational Support Consultancy Services: to assist EAC in (a) issuing licenses to
existing service providers and service providers seeking assistance from the REF; (b)
dealing with tariff applications, fixing of tariffs and writing of tariff orders; (c) monitoring
of licensees in identifying information to be recorded and the format to report the
information to the EAC; (d) regulations and codes including preparation of a Grid Code
and Distribution Code and to issue procedures to amend existing regulations/procedures to
enable EAC to carry out its duties properly; and (e) development of technical standards to
ensure consumer safety and a minimum quality of service by REEs and to build capacity


                                              37
and awareness on renewable energy in EAC. With this TA, eleven regulation standards and
codes were prepared and used and about 297 licenses were issued.
D3-2 Training to EAC staff: Training was provided in areas of (a) foundation skill in
computers, administration and management, and English language; (b) job-specific training
including power sector regulation, pricing control and a methodology for tariff setting; and
public hearings, complaints and dispute resolution; (c) practical training for managers and
senior staff on best practice management and operation of a regulatory body. Training

D.3.3 Facility Support: This consisted of portable meter testing equipment and accessories
were provided.
D.4     TA to EDC
TA to EDC included the following.
D4.1. Project Implementation Consultant (supervision consultant): This TA assisted EDC
in engineering supervision, inspection, coordination, training, and implementation of the
IDA financed 115 kV and EDC grid extensions components of the Project, as well as in the
establishment of the NCC. .
D4.2. In-house advisor: An in-house procurement advisor was hired to assist EDC in all
activities related to project preparation, including procurement, and performed related tasks
as determined by EDC.


                                             38
D4.3. Independent Monitoring Agency (IMA) and Project Grievance Committee: It
supported a services of IMA to help EDC and IRC monitor the resettlement and land
compensation process per the agreed RAP. The IMA produced reports periodic reports.
As agreed, the Project Grievance Committee was established and operational for handling
complaints and grievances not only for the project but for EDC as a whole.
D4.4 - Improvement of EDC Commercial Practices and management training: it supported
the installation of new accounting system FAUMIS and relevant training courses to EDC
staff. In the beginning the new accounting system was installed for the use of EDC
headquarters only, but it was rolled out to seven provincial branches later on.
D4.5. Capacity Building for Land Acquisition, Resettlement and Environment. EDC
initially did not hire the consultant for safeguard capacity training because IRC was
appointed to handle land acquisition and resettlement from the start, and EDC was reluctant
to spend project funds (on-lent to EDC) for training. However, staff of the Social and
Environmental Unit of EDC were invited to various trainings on social and environmental
safeguards organized by the consultants and/or Bank. After RGC delegated land
acquisition and resettlement to EDC, a strong need for training emerged. Finally, TORs
were prepared, but due to time constraints, this activity was dropped. EDC will carry out
this training under the ADB-financed project.
D4.6. MV Network Expansion - Power Investment Planning: Developing a Distribution
Network Plan: A study was carried out on the existing system load, to assess losses and
propose reduction measures, to assess reliability and quality of existing supplies, to develop
a plan for the 22kV backbone system, to assess existing substations and rehabilitation
requirements, assess existing 22kV and LV network and rehabilitation requirements.
Planning software and load monitoring tools and other related items were included in the
services. The distribution plan mainly focused on the Phnom Penh System which includes
the Phnom Penh metropolitan area, Kandal, Kampong Speu and Takeo provinces. The TA
also developed stand-alone specifications for MV system, by taking into account the
existing specifications, which can be used country-wide.
Based on the definition of the distribution system development and the modular
specifications, a tender document was produced for the works identified in the plan. The
tender document included the purchase of the SCADA system for the distribution network.

Assumptions:
      Emission factor of grid in Cambodia: 0.8 tCO2e/MWh, with diesel-based generators (unit capacity >135 kW) operating 6 hours/day as the
       baseline at appraisal;
      Import from Vietnam (started at 80 MW in 2009 and increased to 135 MW in 2011, at 50% load factor)
      EDC's total energy supply during 2005 -2011 is actual (EDC data April 2012);
      SHS - assuming generation at 4 h/day, and 30 days in 2011; 365 days in 2012 and afterwards; and capacity reduced by 2% per year up to
       20% of total reduction in life;
      Hydropower capacity operating at 1,460 h/year (Kamchay for Peak time supply), for Kirirom it is assumed 2,190 h/year, the other
       hydropower is 3,000h/year;
      EdC is maintaining its T&D losses at 10% over the project life and beyond.

                      ECONOMIC AND FINANCIAL ANALYSIS

I.       Project Economic and Financial Analyses
This section comprises: (i) the economic and financial analyses of the grid extension
subcomponent under EDC, (ii) the economic and financial analyses of the grant-assisted
household connection subcomponent under REEs, and (iii) the economic analysis of the
installation of 12,000 solar home systems (SHS) subcomponent under REF. The
economic and financial analyses of the transmission component are not included, and will
be carried out separately by ADB. For the SHS subcomponent, the economic analysis
also evaluates the unique impacts of the subsidy and interest-free financing on the
levelized cost of electricity to the end users.

Even though the economic and financial analyses of the first two subcomponents were
covered at the time of appraisal, substantial details on the model specifications were
lacking for replicating the same analyses at the project completion. As a result, all
economic and financial assessments in this annex are derived from models built from
scratch; therefore any difference in assessment in this annex from the analysis at
appraisal is in part due to potential differences in methodology.

A.       Grid Extension under EDC

     a. Summary of Assumptions

     Willingness-to-pay (WTP): At appraisal, the economic benefit of electricity
     consumption was estimated as the cost of off-grid supply, which was US$0.38 per
     kWh. Due to the surge in oil prices in the past half a decade, the cost of diesel-based
     electricity supply has increased substantially. The growing proportion of supply from
     imports has helped partially offset the impact of rising fuel costs. Consumption from
     the newly connected households, starting from a meager 7 kWh per month in 2009, is
     expected to grow rapidly to 49 kWh in 2019 and 105 kWh in 2029. A single value of
     willingness-to-pay (WTP) would not be appropriate for such a wide range of
     consumption. A two-tier WTP is therefore assumed based on a detailed analysis of
     the tariff and household consumption history in the project area:

        First tier: KH Riel 2320 per kWh (US$0.55 per kWh) for the first 18 kWh every
         month based on the weighted average tariff and consumption among households
         served by REEs in the project area in 2008. Over 90 percent of the HH
         connections through the project were added after 2009. Therefore, data from 2008
         were deemed to be appropriate natural baselines for the project. Moreover, in
         response to the oil price surge in 2008, EAC adopted fuel-cost based tariff
         adjustments. Therefore, the tariffs in 2008 are likely closer to the WTP “ceiling.?
        Second tier: KH Riel 1436 (US$0.34) per kWh for consumption above 18 kWh
         each month based on the weighted average tariff among all REE household
         customers in the project area in December 2010.

     Investment Costs The actual cost of the MV grid extension subcomponent was US$
     9,859,275. The corresponding LV investment funded separately by EDC funds is
     estimated at about 60 percent of the cost of the MV investment. Any additional cost




                                             53
     of US$100 per connection including in-house wiring is assumed for any household
     connection added after the project completion.11

     O&M costs at 4 percent of capital costs.

     Cost of MV supply to EDC in the project area estimated based on an average import
     tariff at around US$0.09 per kWh and a wheeling charge of US0.029 per kWh,
     factoring in the average transmission loss at 3 percent. The economic cost of supply
     excludes tax and VAT of 17.7 percent.

     Connection charge at US$ 58 per connection based on EDC’s weighted average
     connection charge in the project area.

     Tariffs at 911 KH Riels (US$0.217) per kWh for EDC retail customers, and 630 KH
     Riels (US$0.150) per kWh to licensees supplied by EDC. Both estimates are based
     on the weighted average retail and bulk tariff in the project area by end 2010.

     HH Connection Growth Rate at an annual rate of 6.5 percent in the project area
     serviced directly by EDC and 4.5 in the area serviced by REEs. With the population
     growing at 1.5 percent annually and the electrification rate at 30 percent presently, an
     annual growth of 6.5 in HH connections will allow electrification rate to reach the
     government target of 70 percent in 2030.

     Distribution Losses at 9.7 percent for EDC and 16.4 for REEs based on the weighted
     average distribution losses in the project areas in 2010. Distribution loss has
     decreased substantially among the REEs in the project area from 23.0 percent in 2008
     to 16.4 percent 2010. EDC’s distribution loss decreased from 10.6 percent to 9.7
     percent in the same period.

     Exchange rate at KH Riel 4,200 to US$1.00

     Discount rates. To be consistent with the appraisal, an economic opportunity cost of
     capital (EOCK) of 12 percent is applied for the economic analysis, and a weighted
     average cost of capital (WACC) of 6 percent for the financial analyses. A sensitivity
     analysis is carried out with a WACC range from 4-12 percent to assess the financial
     return of this project component.

     b. Economic Analysis Results

The economic internal rate of return (EIRR) of the EDC grid extension subcomponent is
estimated at 28.9 percent compared with 19.8 percent at appraisal. At a 12 percent
EOCK, the project NPV is estimated at US$ 64.9 million compared with US$ 7.9 million.
An estimated US$ 2.8 million out of the project NPV is attributed to lower distribution
losses in the project area. The higher economic return is primarily due to higher
estimates of consumer WTP. At appraisal, WTP was estimated based on the average cost
of off-grid supply in 2003 when fuel price was substantially lower.




11
        The outcome of the economic analysis suggests the NPV of the project is not sensitive to the
        additional cost of connections.

     c. Financial Analysis Results

The financial internal rate of return of the subcomponent is estimated at 7.3 percent
compared with 4.4 percent at appraisal. At a 6 percent WACC, the FNPV is estimated at
US$ 4.9 million compared with a negative US$ 1.3 million at appraisal. Distributional
loss reduction in the project area alone contributed to an estimated US$ 8.8 million in
financial Net Present Value (FNPV). The higher financial return is primarily due to
higher than estimated retail tariff in the project area.

B.         Grid Extension under REE

     a. Summary of Assumptions

          Willingness-to-pay same as in the previous analysis.
          REE cost per connection at US$500 per connection. Sensitivity analyses were
           carried out to measure the responsiveness of the project’s economic and financial
           returns to changes in REEs’ connection costs.
          REE source and costs of supply. Based on EAC 2010 Statistics, about 34 percent
           of the supply to the REEs having received the REF grant was from their own
           generation, which is largely diesel at an estimated cost of US$0.28 per kWh
           before tax and VAT. The remaining 66 percent was supplied either by EDC or
           other licenses at rates similar to EDC’s bulk tariff which is around US$ 0.15 per
           kWh. The cost of supply to REEs is therefore estimated as the weighted average
           of both.
          REE retail tariff at 1,654 riels per kWh based on the weighted average by year
           end 2010 among all REEs having received the REF grant.
          Distribution Losses at 16.4 percent based on the 2010 weighted average
           distribution loss among all REEs having received the REF grant.
          Discount rates with an EOCK of 12 percent for the economic analysis and a
           WACC at 6 percent for the financial analysis. Recognizing the costs of capital
           for the REEs are likely higher than 6 percent, a sensitivity analysis is carried out
           with a WACC range from 4-12 percent to assess the financial return of the REF
           grant-assisted household connections under REEs.

     b. Economic Analysis Results

The economic internal rate of return of the project is estimated at 17.5 percent compared
with 22.3 percent at appraisal. At a 12 percent EOCK, the NPV of the subcomponent is
estimated at US$ 8.9 million compared with US$ 9.6 million at appraisal. The lower
EIRR is primarily due to higher costs of supply from diesel based generation. The higher


                                                  55
NPV in spite of the lower EIRR is due to an additional 5,000 households being connected
compared with the original plan.

   c. Economic Analysis Sensitivities

Changes in two cost factors can alter the evaluation of the economic return of the
subcomponent:

      The Economic Cost of MV supply to REEs: every 1 US cent per kWh increase in
       the cost of supply (excluding taxes and VAT) will decrease the NPV of the
       subcomponent by US$ 1.32 million. However, the actual effect of rising supply
       cost may be less severe because a rise in the cost supply may correspond to a rise
       in the WTP.
      Cost per household connection: every US$50 increase in connection costs will
       decrease the NPV by about US$2.3 million.




   d. Financial Analysis

In the base case, the financial internal rate of return of the project is estimated at 9.8
percent compared with 22.2 percent at appraisal. At a 6 percent WACC, the FNPV is
estimated at US$ 10.5 million compared with US$ 4.3 million at appraisal. The lower
FIRR is primarily due to higher costs of supply from diesel based generation. The higher
FNPV in spite of the lower FIRR is due to an additional 5,000 households connected
compared with the original plan.

                                           FIRR (%)               FNPV ($ million)
                                                                    @ WACC = 6%

                                           56
   e. Financial Analysis Sensitivities

Recognizing REE’s costs of capital can vary and be often higher than 6 percent, a
sensitivity analysis is carried out to measure the respondents of the subcomponent’s
FNPV to changes in WACC from 4 to 12 percent. The FNPV turns out to be highly
sensitive to changes in WACC. When a REE’s WACC increases from 6 percent in the
based case to 10 percent, the project FNPV drops from a gain of US$10.5 million to a
loss of US$0.3 million.

Every US$50 increase in REEs’ cost of connection will decrease the FNPV by about
US$3.2 million.

           b. Economic Analysis

Under a Bulk Supply and Delivery scheme, the REF will pay for the initial capital and
installation costs; the beneficiary households would pay back the capital costs through bi-
monthly installments over four years. A US$100 subsidy is offered on each system. The
economic analysis first assesses the economic return of the subcomponent, and then
estimates the levelized cost of electricity to end users under the following three scenarios:



                                             57
        Scenario 1 without interest free financing, all capital costs paid up front
        Scenario 2 with interest free financing
        Scenario 3 with interest free financing and $100 subsidy per household

Economic analysis usually does not take into account the impact of financing. However,
in this case, the interest-free financing is an important incentive provided by the program.
It can be viewed as a form of subsidy transfer from the global community to the
Cambodian people12. Since the economic analysis is carried out from the perspective of
the Cambodian economy and the cost of financing is born entirely by the global
community, it is therefore feasible to assess the unique impact of financing by comparing
the economic cash flows of Scenario 1 and 2.

The real impact of the interest-free financing and the capital subsidy is to reduce the cost
of supply to the end users, which is measured here in terms of levelized cost of electricity
to the end users.

Under Scenario 1 without financing, the EIRR is 35.4 percent for 30W systems and 36.6
percent for 50W systems; the NPV is US$180.5 for a 30W system and US$243.0 for a
50W system. Under Scenario 2 with financing, the EIRR is 59.0 percent for 30W
systems and 71.8 percent for 50W systems; and the NPV is US$ 291.1 for a 30W system
and US$366.3 for a 50W system.

The levelized costs of electricity to end-users are US$1.00, US$0.91 and US$0.57 per
kWh from the 30W units; and US$0.75, US$0.68 and US$0.47 per kWh from the 50W
units under Scenarios 1, 2 and 3 respectively. The incentives provided by the program
have helped bring down the cost of electricity to an affordable level to the rural
households.

Sensitivity analysis

The levelized cost of electricity from SHS is highly sensitive to under-utilization. For
example, with four hours usage per day, the 50 WP and 30 WP systems deliver electricity
at around US$ 0.75 per kWh and US$ 1.00 per kWh; the cost will double if the system is
used for only two hours a day.

         Cost differences between what HHs pay for electricity and what they would have to pay without
         the financing. The difference is about 7-9 cents per kWh

EDC Financial Performance

At appraisal, the financial viability of EDC was assessed. Several issues that might
jeopardize the company’s financial position were highlighted. They include i)
insufficient tariff to recover costs of supply; ii) high costs of production; iii) outstanding
government arrears; and iv) high distribution losses. Based on a set of assumptions made,
the financial projections for the period 2001-10 demonstrated that EDC’s financial
outlook would remain fragile unless the following measures would be taken i) procuring
fuel on the basis of competitive bids; ii) convert one of its power plants to running on
cheaper fuels; iii) negotiating with IPPs for lower tariff and reduced level of off-take; iv)
reducing staffing costs; v) shutting down older plants to reduce O&M costs; vi) reduce
system losses; and vii) update company bad debt provisions and write-offs.

To promote continued prudent financial management, the following financial covenants
were agreed: (a) sufficient cash flow cover operating expenses and the amount by which
debt service requirements exceed the provision for depreciation; (b) debt service
coverage ratio no less than 1.3 times from 2007 onward; (c) long-term debt to equity ratio
less than 1.5 times.

Financial Performance of EDC

All covenants were met, except for the break-even covenant in 2007 when EDC’s cost of
supply was around Riel 1,012 per kWh and the average tariff around Riel 996 per kWh.
In that year, the Cambodia Utility and Private Limited provided EDC with a Riel 54
million refund for liquidated damages, which helped made up for the shortfall in the
company’s cash flow.

See next page for the latest financial projections for the six year period 2011-2016. Key
financial indicators of the recent past and projected period, the main assumptions used for
the financial forecast are summarized below. According to the projection, EdC is
expected to continue to remain financially viable, and all financial covenants are
expected to be met in the foreseeable future.

Main Assumptions Used for the Five-year Financial Projections, 2011-2016
 Sales growth: 10%
 Inflation rate: 2%
 Tariff and cost of supply: move in the same direction and at the same pace
 Interest rate, finance charges and amortization: per loan agreements
 Depreciation: 30 year straight line depreciation
 Income Taxes: 20% on profit

           STAKEHOLDER WORKSHOP REPORT AND RESULTS

The stakeholder workshop was organized in Phnom Penh on March 23, 2012. The
Workshop provided an opportunity to primary and secondary beneficiaries to share
project outputs and outcomes, challenges, lessons learned and to express their views and
recommendations for better project preparation and implementation. Participants were
mainly the secondary beneficiaries who were officials of MIME, EAC, EDC and REF.
Consultant, contractor and co-financier representative (ADB) also attended the workshop.

Presentation by IAs:

Each of the four project managers from the implementing agencies delivered a
presentation on the project achievements, challenges and lessons learnt under their
respective components, after a general introduction by the project Task Team Leader on
RETP project time frame, structure and expected outputs and outcomes.

In summary, all activities under EDC components were completed, except the safeguards
training for which EDC will use another source of financing (ADB) while continuing
implementing the ADB’s financed project. The outputs expected under the EDC
component were also achieved: (i) completion all physical investment on TL, substations,
the NCC, the MV expansion and equipment/goods purchased; and (ii) completion of TAs.

EAC reported their successful implementation progress including the (i) Operational
Support to EAC - consultancy services; and (ii) Training to EAC staff on technical and
financial regulation. As result, it helped EAC to discharge its responsibilities mandated in
the Electricity Law to regulate the sector and to enhance EAC’s operations.

REF presented achievements under its component including the completion of off-grid
connection of 50,000 new households in the REE coverage areas; the completion of SHS
installation of 12,093 systems, completion of construction of the REF office building and
completion of all TAs assigned to them, plus new activities added during the
restructuring in 2010.

MIME indicated that beside TAs which were completed on the closing date of the project,
27 staff of MIME benefited from the project.

Success factors:
      The key of the success of the project under REF component was flexibility that
       allowed the adaptation of the SHS program based on affordability of the
       household in rural areas to purchase the SHS with several payments (up to four
       years)
      Project support the REF sustainability by reallocating resources for construction
       of the REF office building and some technical assistances that were added during
       the restructuring.
      New delivery model of the SHS was found effective with participation of private
       companies.
      IAs were delegated to do procurement by themselves (within the authorized
       threshold) and their knowledge and capacity have been enhanced.

                                            72
      Implementation support from the Bank was beneficial to all IAs especially on the
       FM (REF case), procurement and safeguards (EDC case).
Challenges to overcome:
     Continue support to IAs in different areas of project management will be
      appreciated.
    Simple project design with less procurement packages should be considered.
    Feasibility studies for investments under project should be done in advance.
    Separate bank account for each implementing agency is important for improving
      accountability.
    IPA performance was not fully satisfactory for all IAs. Reduce IPA involvement,
      strengthen the IA staff on procurement.
Other specific issues:
    One regulation was not finalized by EAC at the time of the Workshop.
    The sustainable charcoal production program under MIME could not materialize
      since the current Forestry Law does not allow to build the kilns within the
      community forest zone. It had to be at least five kilometers away from the
      community forest, which makes it difficult and expensive to transport supplies
      and workers.
    REF indicated that the FS of the five hydropower sites could not be completed
      since they were wrongly targeted.
    The import of power at full scale from EDC from Vietnam could not take place
      due to the increase in the domestic demand in Vietnam.
    The National Control Centre was not fully connected with all remote terminal
      units (RTUs), by the closing date, due to the late kick off of construction of the
      building and installation of SCADA system.
Lesson Learned:
      Close follow-up and support are needed in the implementation stage in order to
       reach the project objectives and build the implementing agencies’ delivery
       capacity by mentoring and guidance.
      Future efforts should provide low interest loans to the REEs in order to benefit
       their potential customers in remote areas.
      End-user preference surveys should be conducted in the targeted areas a few
       months before the procurement of SHS in order to best estimate the preferences
       of the end users on capacity of SHS for more accurate procurement and ensure
       faster installation.
      Review and ensure the proposed hydropower sites are likely feasible before
       undertaking detailed FS for investment.
      Design less and bigger procurement packages in the future, which allow national
       and international companies to equally participate in the bidding.
      To avoid delays, compensation for tree pruning, removal of temporary structures
       should be completed before building power lines.
      Delegate implementing agencies (using the utility budget) for speeding the land
       acquisition process, instead of requesting for (land resettlement) budget directly
       from the Government.

                                           73
      If possible, avoid upgrading (project) as it is more complex and time-consuming
       than building new ones (e.g. for substations)

The workshop was adjourned on the same day with closing remarks of TTL which
underlined valued contributions and efforts of the IAs staff during the project
implementation period, whose collaboration was critical for the success of the project and
thanked them for their sincere cooperation and hospitality extended to the Bank team
during project design and implementation.

SUMMARY OF BORROWER'S ICR AND/OR COMMENTS ON DRAFT ICR
I.        The Borrower’s ICR:

The Borrower’s ICR was submitted to the Bank in January 2012 13 . Following are
summaries of the Borrower’s implementation completion report:

The RETP funded by the WB and the ADB aimed at helping the RGC to achieve the
targets by implementing a wide range of activities including strengthening of Cambodia’s
existing generation, distribution and transmission capacity; technical assistance for
capacity building, institutional strengthening and operational support; and rural
electrification.

The PDOs are assessed to be clear and realistic. The overall rating for achievement of the
PDOs of RETP is assessed as satisfactory. Similarly, the rating of GEO is also
satisfactory. The ratings of PDOs and GEO are supported by the project outcomes, which
are measured by the key performance indicators. The achievement of objectives and
outputs of different components of the implementing agencies are mentioned below:

    To achieve the objectives of improving power sector efficiency and reliability and
     reducing electricity supply costs, and improving standard of living and fostering
     economic growth in rural areas by expanding rural electricity supplies, the 220 kV
     line from Vietnam border to Phnom Penh with substations at Takeo and West Phnom
     Penh have been completed and commissioned by EDC. This has enabled import of
     comparatively cheaper power and has improved operational efficiency and reliability.

    Construction of double circuit 14 km of 115 kV line from WPP substation to GS3
     substation and stringing of conductors for about 22 km of 115 kV line to complete the
     second circuit between the three existing substations GS1, GS2 and GS3 have been
     completed by EDC. This has improved the capacity of the transmission system in and
     around Phnom Penh and has made power supply more reliable. The sub-component
     can be rated as highly successful.

    Up-grading of 115 kV grid substations GS1, GS2 and GS3 have been completed. This
     has increased the capacity at GS1, GS2 and GS3, reduced system losses by improving
     the power factor of the system, and has improved the efficiency of the system. The
     sub-component can be rated as highly successful.

    SCADA interface commissioning and testing is also completed except in two power
     plants. This is a small work and needs shut down of the existing power plants; and
     needs to be completed to complete the testing work at National Control Center. It was
     expected that this activity will be completed within January 2012.

    Extension of 22 kV lines from WPP substation along roads NR3 and NR4 and from
     Takeo substation to Samroang and Kampong Chrey is completed by EDC. MV line



13
         At time of its submission, some activities were still in progress such as installation of SHS, construction of
REF office building, and testing SCADA system.



                                                           75
    work in the provinces of Sihanouk, Battambang, Kampot, Takeo and Kampong Speu
    is also completed. Out of a target of 50, 000 new connections, by November 2011
    more than 45, 000 new connections were connected to the system and it is expected
    that the target of 50,000 new connections can be achieved shortly. The sub-
    component can be rated as highly successful.

   Environmental and resettlement issues for the RETP project were small or negligible
    as the lines are pole mounted and does not involve major land acquisition. Some tree
    cutting and pruning were involved. EDC estimated the number of trees affected to be
    around 15,000. EDC has provided compensation to the private tree owners.

   To accelerate and encourage the REEs to invest on and extend their electric power
    facilities for providing new connection, as per the plan, 135 sub-grants were executed
    by REF during the project operation period and the direct benefit had reached to
    50,000 rural households. The sub-component was successful in meeting its objective
    of providing grant assistance to REEs for 50,000 new household connections in the
    rural areas throughout the country.

   In order to encourage the solar firms and to reduce their per unit capital cost of SHS,
    the grant assistance of USD 100 was given for each SHS, so that, the price of SHS
    would be affordable to rural households, and this would facilitate access to electricity
    where the electricity network has not reached. For the installation of SHS, REF had
    signed the contract with Sunlabob, a private firm. Until January 24, 2012, Sunlabob
    could install 10,505 SHS (87.54 per cent of the target number of 12,000 SHS). It
    expected that, by January 31, 2012, installation of all the 12,000 SHS will be
    completed. The sub-component can be considered successful in meeting its objective
    by installing SHS for 12,000 non-electrified rural households.

   To promote the development of power plants by using renewable energy technology
    and providing electricity to the rural HHs, REF planned to provide the grant
    assistance for mini/micro hydro and renewable energy plant. For this, REF had signed
    the contract with a consulting firm for proving the consultancy service for Renewable
    Energy Business Development, including the feasibility study on the mini/micro
    hydro power projects. In November, 2011, the firm intimated its inability to complete
    the feasibility study on mini/micro hydro projects within the contract period with
    conclusion that sites chosen for the study were not feasible or bankable project that
    investors would be willing to invest in.

   The construction of REF new office building. Up to January 25, 2012, the
    construction firm achieved the construction of 95 per cent. By looking to the progress
    of construction of REF new office building, it was expected that the building
    construction would be completed by January 31, 2012. Therefore, the sub-component
    is considered as successful.

   To assist in the set-up and day-to-day operation of the REF Secretariat contract was
    signed in two phases with two individual international consultants. The consultants
    provided assistance and facilitation for the set-up and day-to-day operation of the
    REF Secretariat. The above TA was achieved and closed.

   For the implementation of SHS program, REF made the contract with a private firm,
    for installation supervision, collection of payment and maintenance of SHS. The
    above technical activities would ensure the sustainability of the sub-component, and
    the sub-component can be considered as successful.


                                            76
   For rural income generation promotion, REF had signed contract with an individual
    international consultant. From this TA, about 1,200 villagers, including business
    owners, prospective business owners and other villagers, of the selected target
    electrified areas were directly benefitted. The above TA was achieved, and closed.

   Conducting Renewable Energy Promotion, and generating awareness. REF had
    signed contract with an international firm, who submitted the draft of final report to
    REF on January 13, 2012. The TA was closed on January 31, 2012.

   Provision of basic and advanced training to REEs: REF had signed contract with a
    specialized NGO. The TA was concluded successfully.

   Improvement and association building of REEs: a contract was signed between REF
    and Individual Local Consultant. The above TA was completed successfully in
    January 2012.

   Building capacity of financial institutions: REF had signed contract with an
    international consulting firm to train the officials of financial institutions in renewable
    energy business. The TA was achieved, and closed.

   An individual consultant provided operational support to EAC (from June 2005 to
    December 2009) to issue licenses to electricity providers and monitor their services.
    In the 5 year period from 2005 to 2009, the number of valid licenses has become
    almost 2.5 times and in the 7 year period from 2005 to 2011 the same has become
    almost 3 times. A number of revisions were made to the licenses during each of the
    years from 2005 to 2011. The large numbers of revisions each year show that EAC is
    regularly monitoring the service provided by the licensees. The project is highly
    successful in achieving the objective of issuing licenses to electricity service
    providers and monitoring their services. Three officers from Finance and Pricing
    Department (of EAC), and 17 officers from EAC took different types of training.

   A contract was signed with an individual consultant to study on sustainable wood and
    biomass supplies at reasonable prices from community forests, woodlots and energy
    plantation, alongside biomass residues from rice husks, animal dung and agri-
    business processing plants and rubber plantations; and to improve the efficiency and
    introduce improved technologies into all aspects of wood and biomass energy supply
    and demand. The consultant has submitted the final report on January 30, 2012.

   Quality training in Management and the English language to complement the
    engineering qualification of MIME’s General Department of Energy Staff: a contract
    was signed between MIME and a local university. An evaluation was made on the
    participants on the quality of the training, which was rated between Very Good and
    Good. The above TA was achieved.

   One Advisor has provided very good support to MIME in specifying and
    implementing the Rural Energy Strategy Program and also more generally in
    supporting MIME in sector development activities. The TA was found to be achieved.

   A master plan for Power Sector Development was carried out by the international
    consulting firm in 2006. The above activity is completed and closed.

   Before the RETP, the sources of energy used by the beneficiary households were car
    battery, generator, kerosene lamp and candle, and use of car battery as energy source
    was more popular among the beneficiary households.

                                              77
   The rapid beneficiary survey found that the average money spent by the beneficiary
    households was USD 14.35 per month before the RETP, whereas, it was USD 20.03
    per month after the RETP. Though the average money spent by the beneficiary
    household increased after the project, but the extent of use of electricity by the
    beneficiary households was considerably more after the RETP compared to that
    before the RETP. All the beneficiary households expressed that before the project
    they were spending comparatively more in terms of the extent of the use of electricity.
    Those who were using diesel generator as the source of energy before the project told
    that, before the RETP project, they paid 2200 Riels/kWh (US$0.53/kWh) to 3000
    Riels/kWh (US$0.73/kWh). But after the project, they were paying 993 Riels/kWh
    (US$0.24/kWh) on an average. So, there was significant reduction in the unit cost of
    electricity after the project. Further, the beneficiary households who were buying
    electricity from REEs were paying more per kW compared to those who were directly
    buying from EDC.

   After the project, the beneficiary households received many kinds of benefits such as:
    better light, better communication, watching TV, use of fan, food processing, study of
    children, safety and security of the house in the night, listening to radio, etc.

   Significant increase in the income of the beneficiary households was found after the
    implementation of RETP as compared to that before the implementation of RETP.
    The average monthly income of the 40 beneficiary households (interviewed) after the
    implementation of the RETP was estimated as USD 311.38 as against USD 202.50
    per month before the implementation of the project, indicating the increase of 53.77
    per cent in the average monthly income of the beneficiary households.

   The REEs expressed that the individuals and different organizations used the
    electricity for food and agriculture processing, carpentry shops, welding shops,
    vehicle repairs, street light, education in schools, health clinics, etc. in their network
    areas. Seventy per cent surveyed beneficiary households complained that there were
    frequent power cuts in their area. All the beneficiary households expressed that the
    project was environment friendly.

   Among the 10 surveyed beneficiary SHS, the percentage female household members
    (52.94 per cent), including one female disabled member, was more than that of male
    members (47.06 per cent). Before the installation of SHS, all the surveyed SHS
    households were using car battery as source of energy for light. After the installation
    of SHS in their houses, the beneficiaries were getting better light, and able to watch
    TV (black and white). Before the installation of SHS, the households were spending
    USD 1.50 to USD 5.00 per month on car battery, and the average monthly spending
    on car battery per household was estimated at USD 2.7. The average spending per
    month per household increased to USD 4.5 after the installation of SHS, and this
    ranged from USD 3.85 to USD 4.80 per month. Though the average spending of the
    SHS households on energy increased after the installation SHS, but the households
    were using the energy to get light and watch TV for long time.

   The average monthly incomes of the SHS households before and after the installation
    of SHS were estimated at USD 57.20 and USD 86.50 respectively. The above
    increase in the monthly income of SHS households was partly due to SHS and partly
    due to the effort of the households. All the surveyed SHS beneficiaries were very
    happy with SHS, and according to them, SHS was environment friendly.

It is concluded from the above findings that almost all the objectives of the project have
been achieved by the implementing agencies. The project activities have helped in raising
the incomes of the beneficiary households. It has helped to some household to do their
                                             78
business. The household members have used the electricity for a number of purposes
such as food and other products, agriculture processing, carpentry works, welding works,
vehicle repairs, street light, education in schools, health clinics, etc. The SHS households
got the benefits like better light, and watching TV. Female household members were
found to be more benefitted from the project compared to male members. The project
was found to be environment friendly. So the achievement of the objectives of the project
is considered as satisfactory.

Key lessons learnt were:

Selection of Households for Installation of SHS and the Need of Additional SHS: It is
observed that many rural households had less interest to take 30Wp SHS. Therefore,
before the procurement of SHS, proper survey should be conducted in the target area, and
the rural households should be explained clearly about the merits and demerits of 50Wp
and 30Wp SHS. On the basis of the survey, final list of households requiring SHS of
different capacities should be prepared.

Some surveyed households having one SHS need one more additional SHS of 50 Wp.
For this, one survey should be conducted, and if possible one more SHS need to be
provided to those households.

Generation of Mini and Micro-hydro Power: There was problem in the selection of sites
for the generation of mini and micro-hydro power under the project. The study found that
the sites selected were not feasible or bankable projects. So, in future, proper care should
be taken for the selection of sites for mini and micro-hydro projects, so that, the investors
will be willing to invest in those projects.

Frequent Power Cut remained: 80 per cent beneficiary households out of 40 surveyed
households in Kampong Speu, Kandal and Takeo provinces complained about frequent
power cuts. EDC should look to this matter seriously, and try to solve the problem
immediately.

Reduction of REE Tariff Rate: Many beneficiary households, particularly those who were
buying electricity from REEs, complained about high tariff rate. In this regard, necessary
efforts should be taken to provide electricity at low tariff rate, so that, the rural poor
households will benefited much.

Fund to REEs for the Extension of Power Supply to the Remote Areas: Because of the
financial benefits given by REF to the REEs under the project, connection of electricity
could take place to 50,000 new rural households. During the rapid beneficiary survey, the
REEs suggested to provide them fund like interest free loan or loan with very low interest
rate, so that, they can extend their grid lines to the remote areas. In this regard, necessary
efforts should be taken to provide interest free loan or loan with very low interest rate to
the REEs who can supply the electricity to the remote areas, and this will benefit to the
people who are living in the remote areas of the country.

Income Generation through Electricity: Generation of income through electricity is
strongly related to electricity tariff, access to reliable electricity supply, availability and
access to electric appliances and electrical equipment as well as sufficient knowledge to
choose, operate, and maintain them, access to row material and market, access to credits,
and education. The stakeholders should look into the above factors, which will provide
them proper guidance in future for the generation of rural income through use of
electricity.

Sustainability of the Project: Infrastructure built under EDC component including high
voltage lines, medium voltage lines and National Control Centre will become a part of
EDC’s supply system. It will generate sufficient revenue from sale of electricity to cover
the operation and maintenance costs of these assets. It is expected that the project assets
will be sustained for 25 years to 30 years.

The assets built by REEs for providing new connections to 50, 000 households will
benefit the households as well as the REEs. These assets also will be sustained for 25
years to 30 years. The sustenance of SHS will depend on proper maintenance of the SHS
and the battery by the rural households. As there is no previous experience of operation
of SHS in the rural areas of Cambodia, it is difficult to ascertain the final sustainability of
the SHS. However, REF is providing maintenance for four years under the hired purchase
contract. Hence, it is expected that SHS will work for at least four years.

The TA components of the project have provided capacity building to the officials of
EDC, EAC, MIME and the REEs. This has improved their working and capacities.

Relevance of the Project
The project has improved the power sector efficiency and reliability, and reduced
electricity supply costs, and improved the standard of living of the people in the rural
areas through the extension of grid lines by EDC and REEs, and installation of SHS.
Through the extension of grid lines of EDC, 50,000 new connections can take place in
the rural areas by January 31, 2012, and another 50,000 new household connections have
already been completed through the grid lines of REEs who have got fund from REF
under the project.

Thanks to the project, the economic standard of living of the people has improved in the
rural area. The tariff rate per unit has decreased considerably. Because of the use of
electricity after the project, the beneficiary households received many kinds of benefits
such as: better light, better communication, watching TV, use of fan, food processing,
study of children, safety and security of the house in the night, listening to radio, etc. The
individuals and different organizations could use the electricity for agriculture processing,
carpentry shops, welding shops, vehicle repairs, street light, education in schools, health
clinics, etc. in the network areas of REEs and EDC.

The SHS sub component benefited the 12,000 rural households living in the remote areas.
Because of installation of SHS in the remote, the beneficiary household members were
getting better light and watching TV (black and white). The standard of living of SHS
households also to some extent could increase because of the project. The female
household members were found to be more benefitted from the project compared to male
household members. All the activities under the project were found to be environment
friendly with very negligible effect on the environment.

The project has also helped to build the capacities of the officials of EDC, REF, EAC and
MIME, and REEs. These officials and REEs are helping, and will help in future for rural
electrification effectively in the country.

The project has provided immense social and economic benefits to the rural people living
in the country. So, the activities of the project are very much relevant for the country like
Cambodia. Because the two decades of war and conflict, along with human resources
huge destruction of physical infrastructure had brought the country to a very low base.
However, Cambodia is of a country in the process of making itself. The growth of the
Cambodian economy over the last decade is an important backdrop for the project under
examination. According to the 2006 World Bank Report on poverty, “Cambodia has
                                              80
consolidated peace and achieved economic growth of about 7 per cent per annum. These
gains reflect the development, both social and economic upon which Cambodia has
embarked, since transitioning from civil war to peace, and from one-party to multi-party
politics. The country’s peace and economic openings have made rapid growth and
relatively rapid poverty reduction. Cambodia’s economic growth; peace and political
stability has contributed to an environment conductive to project support and
interventions, in particular those aimed to improve power sector efficiency and reliability
and reduce electricity supply costs, as well as to improve standards of living and foster
economic growth in rural areas by expanding rural electricity supplies in order to achieve
the Millennium Development Goals. The Rural Electrification and Transmission Project
has improved the electricity infrastructure in the country along with strengthening
electricity institutions, the regulatory framework and the ‘enabling environment’ for
leading to both urban and rural economic growth.

II.       Draft (Bank’s) ICR

Draft ICR was circulated on August 6, 2012 to Borrower and Implementing Agencies for
comments. Following are summaries of comments from the Borrower and Implementing
Agencies:

A.        Comments from the Borrower (MEF):

Comments from the Borrower were received on August 14, 2012. The comments were
mainly editorial.

B.        Comments from the Implementing Agencies:

         Comments from the EAC:

      Comments from the EAC were received on August 9, 2012. The main comment was
      on the reported numbers of licensees. It was suggested that, despite the fact that total
      licenses of 297 issued by the EAC by the closing date of January 31, 2012, it will be
      best represented if the number 297 in the report is replaced by 276. (to count only
      REE doing generation and/or distribution function as on 31-1 2012). It cited that the
      number of licenses valid at the end of 2011 were 297, out of which one (1) license
      was issued to EDC, five (5) licenses for transmission, seventeen (17) licenses for
      Generation which are not involved directly in supply to consumers.

      Team viewed that since the indicator counts “licenses to all IPPs and RREs?, it
      should keep the number 297 as reported earlier.

   Comments from the MIME:

Response without comments was received from MIME on August 10, 2012

   Comments from the REF:

Response without comments was received from REF on August 14, 2012

   Comments from EDC

Two comments were received from EDC on August 15, 2012. They sought
clarification of two statements in the section 2.1 of the ICR which states that (i) "RGC
and EDC not honoring their financial commitments and lack of transparency in
implementation of regulatory rulings and EAC decisions" and (ii) in Section 2.2
which cited that "Delays in appointing key PMU staff. Even though two Project
Management Units (PMUs) were formally established prior to Credit effectiveness,
the implementation of the EDC".

The task team clarified that the section 2.1 of the ICR refers to PAD, Section 2 under
Chapter F: “Sustainability and Risks?, page 29. It was to reassess those critical risks
identified during preparation stage if they were properly rated. Section 2.2 of the ICR
reflects the critical delays identified by Bank’s super vision mission in October 2005
which were documented and communicated with the RGC in the Bank’s management
letter dated December 1, 2005. EDC confirmed it was satisfaction with the
clarification provided.

                    PARTNERS/STAKEHOLDERS


Minor comments in writing from the ADB (co-financier) were received on August 15,
2012. The comments included that:

      Is it necessary to reflect the change of the transmission line capacity is from
       220kV at appraisal to 230 kV as constructed;

      The ADB report at project completion is called Project Completion Report (PCR),
       but not ICR, and

      The actual total cost financed by ADB is $38.90 million and the actual total cost
       financed by NDF is 12.91 million

All ADB comments were incorporated.
