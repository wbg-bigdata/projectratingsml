INTRODUCTION

This document is a Resettlement Action Plan (RAP)       for the construction of a transmission link between    Phnom
Penh and the Vietnamese border near the Vietnamese       town of Chau Doc. This is part of a feasibility study    being
carried out for the ADB by consultants APW of        Australia. The feasibility study for the transmission    link is a
component of the ADB's broader Power Transmission         Project. The RAP shall form part of the implementation
requirements for the Project.

The RAP has been developed to meet the ADB           and World Bank's requirements for the Project in       relation to
resettdement and compensation. It identifies people  affected by the project, the nature and degree of the impacts  on
them, measures taken to minimise the effects and compensation       and other assistance to be delivered to affected
people for unavoidable impacts.

The RAP will need to be revised and updated during         the Project's Design and Implementation Phases, as       the
Project and its impacts develop and become more         precisely defined.    This will be done through a Detailed
Measurement Survey (DMS) updating the Census          and Inventory of Losses data in accordance with        the Final
Design.


SCOPE OF LAND ACQUISITION AND RESETTLEMENT

Project Description

The ADB and World Bank intend to finance the      construction of an electrical transmission interconnection  between
Phnom Penh and Vietnam. The connection point         of the line is ultimately at the Vietnamese town of   Chau Doc.
However, the scope of this study covers only the section  within Cambodia.

The purpose of the transmission interconnection is to improve    the electricity supply to Phnom Penh and Takeo, by
drawing on the established generation capacity and    transmission grid in neighbouring Vietnam. This      is part of a
broader development of electrical infrastructure in  Cambodia, including rural electrification and development       of
generation capacity and transmission infrastructure in the country.

The Project Area and Transmission Line Route    are shown in Figure 2-1.

The main components of the Project are as follows:

    ADB Financed:

        *   220kV Transmission Line with length of approximately       110km, with steel lattice towers approximately
            35 to 45m high and at approximately 350 to 450m        spacing. Thus there will be in the order of 370
            towers.    It is noted that the final design of the transmission        line is the responsibility of the
            Construction Contractor and the location, size and   spacing of towers may vary.

        *   West Phnom Penh Substation (WPP), the termination           of the 220kV line coming into Phnom Penh
            (and incorporating the National Control Centre)

        *   Takeo Substation (TSS)

     World Bank Financed:

        *   115kV Transmission Lines to connect West Phnom Penh          Substation to the existing Transmission Line
            around Phnom Penh. This will consist of a pair of lines,    each about 9km in length giving a total length
            of 18km, and use steel or concrete poles rather than   lattice towers. The poles are expected to be 21m
            high, with a 150 to 200m span. Thus there will be in        the order of 100 poles. These poles will be
            similar in appearance to those on the existing 115kV  line around Phnom Penh.

        *   Updating equipment in the existing Phnom Penh Substations       at GS1, GS2, and GS3

        *   A Grid Extension expanding the existing 22kV lines around      Phnom Penh

  Inter-Ministerial Resettlement            Committee                                                               Resettlement Action      Plan
  Resettlement Unit                                                                                              Final Version January       2005



  Both the 220kV and           115kV Transmission         Lines incorporate a    30 m Corridor of Impact          (COI), covering 15 m       either
  side of the centreline,       where settlement and         structures will not   be permitted and vegetation           height restrictions will
  apply.      For the 115kV line,        the 30-metre corridor        is necessary to provide         for future capacity for      Phnom Penh.
  Electricity distribution       to selected villages     in proximity to the transmission        line is also considered,      connecting from
  the WPP and TSS substations.

  Project Impacts

 The primary social          impacts from the transmission            line will be the permanent          relocation during construction        of
 households and dwellings            and other buildings presently       located within the COI,         and land use restrictions     within the
  COI during operation.            Impacts on land and         property arise from       the need to acquire       land, establishment      of the
 COI, and construction           and operation of the Project.

 Land Acquisition

  Overall Impacts. There             are no effects on indigenous         or other ethnic minorities,         as all of the Affected      Persons
 (APs) are of Khmer            ethnicity, which make        up some 96% of Cambodia's              population. Nor are         there impacts on
 cultural property such         as temples. Therefore          no action is required     under ADB's Policy        on Indigenous Peoples        or
 World Bank Operational            Directive 4.20 or Operational        Policy 4.11 Cultural Property.

 The total area of         land within the 30m           COI for both the      220kV and 115kV is            approximately 384      ha (30 m x
 128.5km), and possibly            around 432 ha including           parts of parcels of      land that extend outside           the COI. The
 inventory identified up          to 3,198 PAFs who         will experience 'resettlement   effeats,' that is will be directly affected by the
 Project in terms of        construction disturbance        of agricultural land within      the COI and also by        the two substations     at
 WWP and TSS.             Those APs who may             be considered Seriously       Affected Persons (SAPs')          are some 145 on the
 220kV COI and 9 on             the 115kV COI whose            structures (all but one     are residences) that will     need to be relocated,
 about 16% within          the same plot of land          and 84% to another      plot of land within         the same village and      9 on the
 115kV COI.          Similarly, 23 APs whose         land is being acquired     for the WWP and TSS           substations may be considered
 SAPs, bringing the presently          verifiable number of SAPs         for the project to 168.

 For ADB's involuntary           resettlement policy,     a signifiantresettlement     effect means 200 people        or more will experience
 major impacts.          "Major" impacts being,          according to both ADB         and World Bank's 'best         practice' threshold for
 determining whether          or not a full resettlement        plan is required, physical     displacement from        housing and/or more
 than 10% of the household's              productive assets.2      A Full Resettlement       Action Plan is presented          here to take into
 account the possibility        that the results of the     Detailed Measurement       Survey (DMS) will indicate         conclusively that the
 resettlement effects on        the entire displaced population        are 'significant' according      to ADB and World Bank          criteria.
 The ADB and World            Bank's best practice for       determining severity     of impact upon individual        households is physical
 displacement from         housing and/or 10%           or more of the household's         productive, income generating          assets lost. A
 number of APs among             those losing an estimated        7,300 economically valuable         trees, primarily sugar    palm, along the
 COI may possibly be            considered SAPs although           this may only really       be determined once         the COI are actually
 pegged out by the contractors.               Many of these in any        case are likely to be        the owners of residences        requiring
 relocation, as the trees      tend to be clustered       around built up residential     areas.

These estimates are based            on the assumption         of construction activity     being restricted to the       COI and substation
 boundaries. Any additional           disturbance outside        the defined area will    also require compensation.           The requirement
 for, and location of,      any access roads or other         land requirement such       as storage areas, borrow       pits, works areas, etc
will be determined        during the Project's Design          and Construction stage.       It will be necessary     at that stage to identify
any other APs and ensure            mitigation and compensation         measures are provided.

              transmission line,     and to have land       use controls for     the safe operation      of the line, such     as requiring the
              removal of trees      and structures.       Other compatible       land uses such      as farming of     ground crops      will be
              allowed to continue.        As a result, for      the majority of     APs along the        transmission line     COIs, the land
              acquisition will   have little long-term     effect on their   current farming     of the land.
              The area acquired       for a tower will    usually comprise      a small proportion       of the plot of    land on which     the
              tower is located.     Land acquisition      at each of the   estimated 370 tower       sites for the 220kV     transmission line
              has been assumed       to be 100 m2 (8      m square plus     1 m buffer), totalling     3.7 ha for the    entire line, although
              the actual area     will be dependant       upon the final     design. Among        total acquired    land, 91 percent     will be
             paddy land. (Note        that for the RAP      a conservatively   small spacing of     300 m has been      adopted, so that    cost
             estimates will    be upper limits.     In all probability,   the number of      towers will be     around 300). The       footprint
              of each tower    will only occupy      the four footings     of the structure,    estimated at 4     m2 per footing     (16m2 per
             tower). The tower       footprint area will     total 0.5 ha for  the 220kV line,     with cropping     or grazing (but    not tree
             planting) permitted      on the remaining      acquired land.     Accordingly, only      one sixth of the     total acquired land
             will have a land    use change.

             All landowners      who will have    land acquired    for towers will    only have a single      site acquired.   In other words,
             for the acquisition      of 3.7 ha land     areas, a total of   370 households        and 2,100 persons       would be affected
             (based on 5.7     persons per household).          The actual paddy      land area acquired        for a 220kV tower      from an
             average "small"      landholding (2,500      m2) is likely to  total only 4%      of the total landholding
             m2). Land acquired                                                                                              (100 M2 of 2,500
                                        for a tower on       a house block     is likely to be     a more significant     proportion of     this
             household land      type. The average      yard area is estimated     to be 250 m2 therefore
                                                                                                   ,             acquisition of    100 M2 for a
             tower would amount        to 40% of the house       block.

             Of the APs found        along the 220kV        COI, consisting     of a total of some      330 ha,3 some      2,661, or 91%,     of
             cases surveyed     in the Census      carried out 2000-2001       were APs owning         rice farmland.     About 4% of APs
             owned structures      that will require    relocation. The      rest of the AP       cases, some 5%,      appear to be various
             forms of public     or institutional  ownership.4

             Structure Displacement            by 220kV Transmission             Line.     Some 140 AP          structures (all   but one are
             residences) identified     in the RCS will      need to be relocated,      in 38 villages,    of 19 communes,        in 9 districts
             within Phnom       Penh Municipality        and Kandal, KIompong           Speu, and Takeo        Provinces.     A total of 140
             households and       800 persons will      be affected. There       is one commercial-scale         chicken farm that      will be
             affected at Krang     Chake village,    requiring the relocation      of a chicken shed       within the same     site. No other
             businesses will be    affected.

            Removal of Trees          from within      the 220kV COI          Although farming         of ground crops      such as rice can
            continue beneath       the transmission      line, removal of     trees from within       the 30m COI        will be required    to
            prevent the possibility      of a tree falling    on the transmission       line. Individual      trees located    outside of the
            COI, which present        a danger of falling     on the line, will  also need to be     removed. Some         6,112 trees, about
            98% of economic        value to AP households,         are estimated to      be required to      be removed from        the 220kV
            COI. Almost       40% of trees reported         by APs as within      the COI are Sugar        Palm. The agricultural       system
            found in upper        Takeo has been        categorized as      a 'Rice and Sugar        Palm Complex,"         highlighting the
            importance of     sugar palmn trees    as a necessary crop     for providing families     with a much needed        cash income.
            West Phnom       Penh and Takeo          Sub-Stations

            The land acquisition      for the substations     can be considered      to have a serious      effect on the APs     involved, as
            the land take may      involve a considerable       proportion of     their agricultural   land holdings, though        unlike the
            transmission line     no structures per se    wil be affected.      Altogether some       4.5 ha of land     in 23 plots will   be
            acquired from     23 APs, plus an      additional 0.7    ha for access roads      to the substations,     taking a possible   one
            third ofmedian     landholdings, for      a total of 5.2 ha.    Both areas appear      rural but are actually    peri-urban, and
            therefore locational    factors may need      to be considered      in determination     of compensation       rates, in addition
           to land productivity.

        LandAcquisition for Transmission Line Polee Land acquisition at each of the estimated 93 pole sites
        for the 115kV Transmission Line will be 4 m2 (2 x 2 m), potentially totalling 0.024 ha (240m2) for all poles
        within the COI. This amounts to less than 0.1% ofthe 56 ha COI. It should, however, be noted that actual
        acquisition may be about half of this amount, as much of the two 115kV lines is located within existing
        road easements where the placement of poles will have no effect on private landowners. Some 241, or
        88%, of cases surveyed in the AP Census carried out 2000-2001 owned rice farmland and another 13 (50/0)
        unspecified, though probably also owners of rice farmland. Two thirds of AP-owned structures (9 houses)
        will require relocation. The rest of the AP cases, some 12, or 5%, appear to be various forms of public or
        institutional ownership.

        Structure Displacement by 115kV Transmission Line. The RCS found that, of the 9 AP residents that
        will need to be relocated, one is on the northern 9km Transmission Line, in Toul Kei Village, Phleung
        Cheh Roteh Commune, Dong Kor District, in Phnom Penh Municipality.              The other 8 are found in 5
        villages (Domnak Troyeung, Prey Thom, Prey Tituy, Prey Sor West, and Koul Pung Ror) in two communes

        Removal of Trees from within the 115kV COI Some 184 trees, about 100%/o of economic value to AP
        households, are estimated to be required to be removed from the 115kV COI. Of course, it is very difficult
        to know for sure how many of these are actually within the COI and how many simply reported by APs as
        owned, and this won't be known for sure until the pegging is done by contractors.

Summary of the Main Scope of Resettlement Impacts

Table E-1 provides a summary of the main scope of resettlement impacts. According to the survey and estimate, a
total of 634 households and 3,525 persons would be affected by land acquisition and relocation, including 485
households and 2,680 persons to be affected by land acquisition, and 149 households and 845 persons to be
affected by removing of their structures. (This does not include all those who might be affected by temporary land
occupation and removal of trees.) Among 149 structures to be removed, 3 are American style, 64 as Kantang Al,
49 as Kantang A2, 10 as Pet B1, 18 as Pet B2, 1 as Pet B3, and 4 as others, including one chicken farm, two empty
lots and one public pond. The total demolished floor space amounts to 4,987 square metres, averaging 33 square
metres per house. Among total acquired land area, 96.3 percent are paddy land and 3.7 percent as residential land
or other lands.

Temporary Effects during Construction

Likely impacts on APs from crop damage during construction and interference with field preparation and planting
will be dependent on a number of factors, especially the yield of rice (tonnes per hectare) and the market price for
the rice.  Construction activity may interfere with field preparation, damage crops and affect related farm work,
depending on the timing of construction with respect to timing of farm work.

It is possible that construction could be timed to avoid damage; however this will be difficult to manage and may
increase the cost of construction. In addition the cost and complexity of monitoring would significantly increase.

Temporary damages can be multiple - for instance damage to fields, bund walls (highly localized and small),
communal property, temporary relocation, business loss, and occupation of storage areas - and will be the financial
responsibility, as per contract agreement, of the contractor(s). This is important to provide incentive to contractors
to keep this damage as minimal as possible.

Cost estimates have also been assessed as an upper limit, because most of the construction activity should occur
during the fallow season, when it will not affect crops.

Similarly, compensation for on-going impacts during maintenance activity is not included in the RAP, as this is
outside the scope of the Project implementation. Cost of ongoing maintenance is expected to be small, consisting
of possible damage to crops and ground while accessing the line. As with the construction phase, this will be built
into the Maintenance Contract by requiring the contractor to make good any damage caused.



SOCIOECONOMIC INFORMATION

General Land Use and Tenure

The area through which the transmission line will pass consists mainly of rice fields in very flat terrain with scattered
sugar palms, isolated areas of shrub and woodland, village garden crops, numerous scattered villages and houses,
temples and road side development of small businesses.              Isolated hills occur in the plains, and are generally
vegetated with forest or woodland and often topped by a temple (the transmission line route avoids these hills).

The major economic activity in the Project area is rain fed lowland rice farming. Farming families generally live in
the nearby village on higher ground and work their fields surrounding the village. Other farming activities incdude
vegetables and tree crops, small-scale livestock production and collecting fish, frogs and crabs in rice fields and
channels. The villages are located mostly along roads, with some small businesses also developed along the sides of
major roads. Fruit, vegetables and livestock such as cattle, pigs and chickens are raised around the houses.

Very few people in Cambodia have formal legal title to their land.             Nevertheless, the Land Law, in terms of
possession and use of land, recognizes private property rights. Under the national Constitution and the Land Law,
compulsory acquisition of land by the Government is only permitted in the national interest and with just and
proper compensation in advance.          Ownership of land is largely demonstrated by occupation and use and
recognition by the community.

A form of land title exists in the Certificate of Possession and Use of Land. However few Certificates have been
issued, with a large backlog of applications filed with the Land Titles Department. In practice the Receipt issued for
the application is itself used as evidence of ownership and is passed on when land is sold or ownership otherwise
transferred. The 2000 AP Census reported that, of the 3198 APs, 33% had Certificates and 51% had receipts. Field
surveys indicate that there is a low level of activity in the land market, although evidence of an active property
market has been reported elsewhere.       Land transactions in Cambodia may involve only the buyer and seller, with
recognition of boundaries by neighbours, and usually do not involve any legal paperwork or authorities. Due to the

scarcity of formal land title, a major part of the Project has been to undertake field surveys along the right-of-way to
identify land ownership, Project effects and compensation entitlements.

Socio-Economic Characteristics

By far the most common primary occupation was farming (87% ofrespondents), with rice being the main source of
income. This is roughly the same proportion as found for the 2001 AP Census, which listed farming in around
90% of cases and the 698 APs covered by the Socio-Economic Survey.                            A number of other occupations and
income sources were reported, including various paid work and business activities.

Reported annual household incomes ranged from to $2,737 to only $13, with a median of $183 and an average of
$249, from the PreliminarySocio-EconomicSurvey results for 118 APs. Focusing on the 125 APs covered by the more
comprehensive Socio-economic Survey along the 220kV COI severely affected due to their house requiring
relocation, the highest annual household (HH) income reported was approximately $2,900. From total household
annual income and size of household,5 the highest per capita income reported is $75. Based on the Poverty Reduction
PartnershipA4greement between the ADB andCambodiaUuly 2001), the most recent estimate of the poverty line is US$14
per person per month. Given this, 87% of the 125 most severely affected APs would be classified as at or below
the national poverty line.

The 1998 Census literacy rates for the general population in the 176 communes along the COI is nearly 69% for the
adult population (over 15 years),          8 3% for males and 57% for females.                 In the general population along the
Transmission Line COIs, some 35% have not completed their Primary Education (though have some schooling),
22% have completed Primary Education, 9% Lower Secondary, and 2% have a Secondary Education or above.6

All APs interviewed in the preparation Census and Socio-Economic Survey identified themselves as ethnic Khmer
(no indigenous or other ethnic minorities have been identified in the surveys). KIhmer women are reported to have
a strong 'matrifocal' role7 within Cambodian households, inherit property equally with sons, and play a strong role
in the Cambodian economy as small-scale business entrepreneurs, all of which will need to be taken into account in
land compensation procedures and in any income restoration strategy devised for the Project's RAP.

Vulnerable Groups

The ADB and World Bank require that particular attention be paid to vulnerable groups among people affected by
the project. Vulnerable groups are those who, for a variety of reasons, may be less able to deal with the disturbance
caused by the project and adapt to new situations.                Examples include the poor, disabled, landless, households
headed by women, elderly or children, returnees and indigenous or other ethnic minorities.

Among the 698 APs responding in the 2000-2001 Socio-Economic Survey (22% of the total APs), some 26% were
identified as being among vulnerable groups, viz, 19 % of all respondent APs being female-headed households, 4%
elderly and without support,        2% disabled, and 2% 'very poor,' 'returnees,' or 'children without parents.' Close
inspection found that some of these 'vulnerable' APs were in higher income brackets, for instance 8 of the 131
female-headed households, or as in the case of one 'disabled' was a retired high ranking army officer. More than
90%, however, of those identified as 'vulnerable' would appear to require special aid, and the issue will need dose
attention at the time of the Detailed Measurement Survey.


OBJECTIVES, POLICY FRAMEWORK, AND ENTITLEMENTS

Objectives and Principles

The Project's resettlement and compensation are to be in accordance with ADB and World Bank requirements and
Cambodian law8.         The ADB and World Bank have advised that it is a condition of funding that the Banks'
requirements are met in relation to resettlement and compensation.




5Average household size is 5.1 persons.
6The corresponding percentages for the 127 APs household heads along the 220kV Line who are required to shift their residences are
29% having some schooling, 39% completed Primary School, 19% Lower Secondary, and 13% having a Secondary Education or above.

The Objectives and Principles for resettlement and compensation to be adopted to implement the Banks' policies
for the project are as follows:

        Resettlement Objectives:

        The Resettlement Action Plan aims to ensure that the losses incurred by affected people are redressed such
        that Affected Persons share project benefits, are assisted to develop their social and economic potential in
        order to improve or at least restore their incomes and living standards to pre-project levels and are not
        worse off than they would have been without the Project.

        Resettlement Principles:

        *    Acquisition of land and other assets, and resettlement of people will be minimized as much as possible
             by identifying possible alternative project designs, and appropriate social, economic, operational and
             engineering solutions that have the least impact on populations in the Project area.

        *    The populations affected by the Project are defined as those who may stand to lose, as a consequence
             of the Project, all or part of physical and non-physical assets, including homes, homesteads, productive
             lands, commercial properties, tenancy, income-earning opportunities, social and cultural activities and
             relationships, and other losses that may be identified during the process of resettlement planning.

        *    All APs who will be identified in the project impacted areas as of the date of the updated census and
             inventory of losses, will be entitled to be compensated for their lost assets, incomes and businesses at
             full replacement cost and provided with rehabilitation measures sufficient to assist them to improve or
             at least maintain their pre-project living standards, income earning capacity and production levels.

        *    All affected populations will be equally eligible for compensation and rehabilitation assistance,
             irrespective of tenure status, social or economic standing, and any such factors that may discriminate
             against achieving the objectives outlined above.

        *    The rehabilitation measures to be provided are: (i) cash compensation for houses and other structures
             at replacement cost of materials and labour without deduction for depreciation or salvageable materials;
             (ii) full tide to replacement agricultural land for land of equal productive capacity acceptable to the AP;
             full tide to replacement residential and commercial land of equal size acceptable to the AP; or, at the
             informed decision of the AP, cash for replacement land at replacement cost at current market value;
             (iv) cash compensation for crops and trees at current market value; and (v) relocation allowances and
             rehabilitation assistance.

        *    There will be no deduction in payments for salvage value, depreciation, taxes, stamp duty, fees, or any
             other payments

        *    Sufficient time will be allowed for replacement structures to be built before construction begins

        *    Temporarily affected land and communal infrastructure will be restored to pre-project conditions.

        *    The compensation and resetdement activities will be satisfactorily completed and rehabilitation
             measures in place and all encumbrances removed on a contract area before the Government and ADB
             will approve commencement of civil works for that contract area.

         *   The EA will see that institutional arrangements are in place to ensure effective and timely design,
             planning, consultation and implementation of the land acquisition, compensation, and resetdlement and
             rehabilitation program.

         *   Existing cultural and religious practices shall be respected and, to the maximum extent practical,
             preserved.

        *    Adequate budgetary support will be fully committed and be made available to cover the costs of land
             acquisition and resetdlement and rehabilitation within the agreed implementation period.

        *    Special measures shall be incorporated in the RAP and complementary mitigation and enhancement
             activities to protect socially and economically vulnerable groups such as, women-headed families,
             children and elderly people without support structures and people living in extreme poverty.

        *    Grievance procedures shall be established and in place and APs informed of them before any
             resettlement activities begin.

        *    Details of the RAP shall be distributed to the APs and placed in project and commune offices for the
             reference of affected people as well any interested groups.

        *    Appropriate reporting, monitoring and evaluation mechanisms will be identified and set in place as part
             of the resettlement management system and an external monitor hired before commencement of any
             resettdement activities.

        Other objectives and principles related to implementation of the resettlement and compensation
        requirements are described in the Entitlements Matrix.

Eligibility and Entitlements

        Eligibility

        Eligible parties for the purpose of this Project are identified as Affected Persons (APs). This term refers to
        a collective unit of entitlement, and is used in this document to refer to families, other households,
        individuals and businesses and any other group affected by the Project. APs eligible for Compensation
        shall be those who experience negative impacts on their assets or livelihoods as a result of the Project.
        Measures will be incorporated in Project design to minimise adverse impacts.

        APs eligible for Compensation shall include the following:

        *     For land required to be permanently acquired for the Project (Transmission Towers, Substations,
              Roads):

              *   Owners with Formal Legal Title

              *   Owners/occupiers, who are eligible for Formal Legal Title under Cambodian law

              *   APs with other recognised Land Use Rights

              *   Occupiers who are not eligible for Formal Legal Title

        *     For permanent removal within the COI, of houses, other structures and improvements, and land based
              assets such as trees

              *   Owners of houses and other structures (whether with land title or not)

         *    For temporary effects such as disturbance to crops during construction:

              *   Farmer/land users within the COI.

         *    For effects on businesses

              *   Owners of businesses

              *   Employees who have lost income as a result of the Project.

        Types of APs and their proposed eligibility for compensation are detailed in the Entitlements Matrix.

         It is an ADB and World Bank requirement that compensation is not restricted to those with Formal or
        Legal Land Title. All recognised landowners, occupants and users shall be eligible for compensation. In the
         case of APs living in or using land within the COI of roads or railway lines at the time of the declared cut-
         off date, APs shall be fully eligible for compensation.      Those eligible are identified in the AP Census,
        prepared as part of the Project.

        APs who move into the Project area after the Cut-Off Date will not be eligible for land acquisition
         compensation, though any such APs would be eligible for compensation caused by Construction activities.
        The cut-off date for determining eligibility for compensation shall be the time at which the AP Census is
         completed after detailed design and approved by the ADB, World Bank and RGC.

        The purpose of the Cut-Off Date is to minimise the incentive for land speculation, and minimise the
        incentive for people to move into the Project area in the hope of gaining Compensation.

Resettlement Unit                                                                          Final Version January 2005



        However, it may be possible that some APs may have been missed in the Census. Therefore those who
        can demonstrate that they are eligible will also be included in the AP Census.

        Entitlements

        The underlying principle for determination of Entitlements is that no one will be made worse off as a result
        of the Project. Therefore pre-Project living standards are to be maintained or improved as a result of the
        Project.

        The value of compensation paid will be at least equal to the cost of replacement of the asset lost, without
        reduction for any depreciation or salvaging of materials.       In the case of land, the preferred method of
        compensation is equivalent land, and this shall be available as an option to the APs. However where
        relatively small areas of land are involved (say less than 20% of the AP's total productive land area), then
        cash compensation will be acceptable.      Full replacement value will be paid to land owners, regardless of
        whether they hold formal title or not. The Entitlements Matrix summarizes the types of Impacts, APs who
        will be eligible for compensation, what their entitlements will be, and provides comments on
        implementation issues. The following measures shall also be provided at implementation:

        *    As much notice as practically possible will be given to APs

        *    Payments will be made before Construction commences

        *    There will be no deduction in payments for salvage value, depreciation, taxes, stamp duty, fees, or any
             other payments

        *    Sufficient time will be allowed for replacement structures to be built before Construction begins

        *    Independent Monitoring will be carried out

        *    Grievance Procedures will be established


CONSULTATION, GRIEVANCE REDRESS AND PARTICIPATION


Objectives of Public Consultation and Information Dissemination Program

Information dissemination to, consultation with and participation of APs and involved agencies and Stakeholders
reduce the potential for conflicts, minimize the risk of Project delays, and enable the Project to design resettlement
and rehabilitation as a comprehensive development program to suit the needs and priorities of the APs, thereby
maximizing the economic and social benefits of the investment.          Specific objectives of the public information
campaign and public consultation are as follows:

        *    To share fully the information about the proposed Project, its components and its activities, with the
             APs

        *    To obtain information about the needs and priorities of the APs, as well as information about their
             reactions to proposed policies and activities

        *    To inform about various options for relocation and rehabilitation measures available to the APs

        *    To obtain the cooperation and participation of the APs and communities in activities required to be
             undertaken for resettlement planning and implementation

        *    To ensure transparency in all activities related to land acquisition, resettlement and rehabilitation

Public Participation

In the context of resettlement, public participation includes both the information exchange (dissemination and
consultation), and collaborative forms of decision-making (participation).         Dissemination refers to transfer of
information from Project authorities to the affected population. Consultation, on the other hand, generally refers
to joint discussion between Project authorities and the affected population serving as a conduit for transfer of
information and sharing of ideas. Public participation is an ongoing process throughout resettlement planning and
implementation, not an event. The level of information which is disseminated or the issues on which consultation
takes place vary with the progress in the Project process and resettlement activities.

Disclosure

ADB and World Bank require that the Executing Agency disseminate information to affected people.                   Public
disclosure of the RAP is required before the Management Review Meeting (MRNM).              Public disclosure of the draft
RAP must be made to the APs in a form and language that they can understand. This may be in the form of a
resettlement information brochure or leaflet, or a summary Resettlement Action Plan to be provided to APs in a
language they can understand, in an accessible place. The final RAP, if changed, must be made available to the APs
before the Staff Review Committee (SRC). The RAP, or its summary, will also be posted on the ADB's and World
Bank's resettlement websites. Summary RAPs will also be released, together with Summary Environmental Impact
Assessment (SEIA), where relevant, for public disclosure. If the EA decides to disclose to APs by means of a
brochure or leaflet, the consultant shall draft such a leaflet to be included in the RAP, together with a schedule for
distribution of the brochure/leaflet or summary RAP to the APs.

For the updated RAP, new notices and public meetings will be carried out, in accordance with both ADB and the
World Bank policies.       A Pubic Information Booklet has been prepared in both English and Khmer for
dissemination among the APs and other Stakeholders, and announcements will be in both English and Khmer
language newspapers, as well as by Khmer language radio and TV.

Complaints and Grievances

In order to ensure that AP grievances and complaints on any aspect of the land acquisition, compensation, and
resettlement are addressed in a timely and satisfactory manner and that all possible avenues are available to APs to
air their grievances, a well defined grievance redress mechanism will be established by the Project, related to its
consultation program and the implementation monitoring carried out by the Independent Monitoring Organization
(TMO).    The Project Management Offices (PMOs) 1 & 2 will establish a Committee for the consideration of
complaints and grievances from APs.           This Grievance Redress Committee (GRC) will have as members,
representatives of the following: PMOs 1 & 2/EDC; IRC at the National Level, where required but usually through
Local Authority Resettlement Sub-Committees; Commune Committee Member(s); IMO (Observer role); Local
leader in each village/local area.

The community consultation program will provide contact details for submission of complaints and grievances.
This will include a phone contact and address for written submissions. However, as this is not a practical means of
communication for many people in remote areas, it will also be necessary to establish an appropriate alternative
avenue for APs who are illiterate or for whom these are not appropriate avenues. APs will also have the option of
contacting the TMO should they wish, the local authority or their local Member of Parliament. There will be no fees
or charges required of those wishing to have a complaint heard. If any payments are made then the fee shall be
refunded by the Project. Other costs incurred by legitimate complainants will also be refunded by the Project.
Follow up checks of this will be included in the scope of the TMO.


RELOCATION AND REHABILITATION


For the whole project, there are three main types of impacts. One is permanent land loss under the transmission
line due to the construction of towers or poles. The second type of impacts is permanent land loss due to land
acquisition for the construction of two substations and access roads. The third type ofimpacts is due to removal of
structures and attached facilities (including trees) under the COI of transmission lines.

For those affected due to land loss under transmission line, since the acquired land area will be relatively small for
each household, averaging 100m2 for each tower under 220kV transmission line, and 4m2 per pole under 115kV
transmission line, cash compensation at market price will be adopted as main approach for resettlement and
rehabilitation. In general, the acquired land area is small in relation to the typical size of each piece of land (around
0.25ha or 2,500m2) and total landholding per farming family (around lha). Such limited land loss would not pose
any serious economic impacts for the affected people. The total area for the 220kV transmission towers will be
around 3.7ha and around 0.04 ha for the 115kV poles.

For those affected under two substations, approximately 4.5 ha is required at West Phnom Penh and 1.5ha at
Takeo, plus approximately 0.7 for access roads.

However, under such conditions, the ADB and World Bank requirements specify that the preferred form of
compensation for involuntarily acquired land is provision of replacement land nearby of equivalent type, size and
value with similar access to livelihood opportunities. An exception to the 'land for land' rule is made in the case of

small areas of land (say less than 0% of the owner's total productive land holdings), where cash compensation is
                                   2

acceptable. In this case the project affected family's land base, as its primary source of income remains substantially
viable. In this case the AP must be provided with independent counselling and advice in the management of their
compensation payment and the long-term maintenance or improvement of their livelihood.

Interviews with all affected people indicated that most of them would like to have cash compensation instead of
providing replacement land. This is because that with the compensation rates set at 3.5 US dollars per square metre
at TSS site and 4.5 US dollars per square metre at WPP site; it is quite easy to purchase replacement farmland in
these locations.    The adequate compensation rates will also provide opportunities to engage in other income
generation activities, which average $9,300 per family or $2,477 per person.          However, closer to the time of
implementation further consultation with these affected people will be carried out in order to determine their
individual preferences in relation to provision of land, provision of cash, provision of advice and other assistance to
improve the productivity of their remaining land or develop alternative livelihoods.

In the case of replacement land being required for houses that have to be removed from the COI, surveys have so
far been unable to locate suitable replacement land. It is required to provide these APs with an equivalent standard
of housing in the same villages with the same access to livelihood opportunities. The replacement new housing plot
could either be provided in kind or in cash. With the provisions of compensation on residential plots based on
market prices along the alignment, alternative housing plots could be obtained in the same villages. In order to
achieve this it will be necessary to purchase some other land and develop it for housing. This will most commonly
involve purchasing either residential land or rice growing land and filling to raise the ground level to enable it to be
kept well drained. This land will be purchased by the Project or the APs him or her self from willing sellers. The
appropriate action will need to be determined on a case-by-case basis during the Project design stage and with
NGOs involved in the Project's income restoration program acting, along with the RAP and Environmental
Coordinator (RPEC) as AP advocates in the process. The cost of residential replacement plots is included in the
RAP budget, along with a land filling allowance for raising land to an acceptable level for residential purposes.

The need for replacement of houses arises where houses need to be removed from the COI for safety reasons.
Replacement houses are to be provided to an equivalent size and standard within the same village, with similar
access to resources and facilities such as land, roads and livelihood opportunities.        Materials from the existing
structure are to be available to the owner for salvage with no deduction from the compensation value.              Cash
compensation sufficient to replace materials and labour to build replacement houses to an equivalent size and
standard will be given to APs that prefer this option, and there will be no deduction for depreciation, taxes, stamp
duty, fees or other payments. The land within the COI from which the house has been removed is suitable for
other uses such as farming of ground crops and will remain accessible to the original owner. Aside from tower
pads, the land will not be required for the Project and therefore will remain the property of the previous occupant.
During the RCS questioning, most APs expressed their preference for cash payment for their houses, preferring to
organize the relocation and construction of new houses on their own. Where this is not the option chosen, or
where vulnerable APs require special assistance, the Project will organize suitable direct assistance, such as
providing materials and hiring a contactor, for replacing houses, at an equivalent or better standard.

For those affected due to temporary land occupation, it will be confirmed during DMS or even project
implementation. Efforts will be made to minimize such impacts by timing the construction after planting season.
The affected people will be paid compensation for all lost income based on average yield and market price for
crops, plus cost for restoring land into original conditions. For those who lost trees, particularly valuable economic
trees, in addition to the compensation received, they will be provided with income restoration assistance by the
project. Consultant will develop the details of such assistance program.


INCOME RESTORATION STRATEGY


Income Loss

Income losses for SAPs caused by substation land acquisition and displacement of structures within the COI, as
well as losses due to temporary impacts during Construction are generally covered by the Compensation
Entitlements. The requirement of moving trees from the Transmission Line COIs may be the largest direct income
loss for individual APs. However, it is very difficult at this stage to assess the income loss, either more broadly or
for an individual AP. It is possible, however, to make a general assessment of the income loss that is possibly
involved in removing trees from the COI.

Sugar Palm (Borassus flabellifer). There are by far more Sugar Palms, Thnot in Khmer, likely to be removed
from the Transmission Line COIs than any other type of tree, about 40% of all trees along the 220kV Line and
around 36% of trees likely to fall within the 115kV Line. Some 488 APs were reported to have about         2,769 Sugar
Palm trees possibly affected by the 200kV COI, nearly 6 trees per household where trees owned per household may
vary from 10-30, so that conceivable loss is, somewhat theoretically at this point, on the order of 20-60%,
depending on final design and actual number of trees requiring to be removed from the COI.

Ovesen et al (1996) have categorized the agricultural system found in upper Takeo as a 'Rice and           Sugar Palm
Complex," highlighting the importance of Sugar Palm trees as a necessary crop for providing families with a much
needed cash income. The Sugar Palm, tapped for its juice during the dry season, starting in December or January
right after paddy harvest and finishing at the time of plantation of the paddy seedbeds in May or June, provides
about equal or even more income to farmers as rice farming during the wet season.             For instance, in Oudong
District, Kampon Speu Province, where about 50% of families are palm sugar producers, rice was estimated to
produce around US$190,000 annually, while palm sugar was estimated, depending on selling price (350-600 riels/kg)
to earn $125-220,000 per annum district-wide.        Men generally collect the sap and women undertake the more
strenuous tasks of collecting wood for cooking the palm syrup and the other tasks involved in processing.

Unfortunately, the price for sugar derived from the palm sugar collapsed in 1999 due to the competition of white
sugar and the end of exports to Vietnam.           In Oudong District, some 40% of palm sugar producers ceased
production, leading to exodus of many to Phnom Penh. Further, concerns have been raised about the pressure on
forest resources from palm sugar production, for which about 4 kg of fuel-wood is estimated required to produce 1
kg of palm syrup. Palm Sugar trees take about 20 years to reach maturity for producing sap and produce for up to
another 80 years in many cases. Other sources of income from Sugar Palms are: (a) making products from Sugar
Palm fibre, for which only the younger trees are suitable, such as brooms and other handicrafts; roofing, and wall
materials from the leaves; fruit, which is eaten or used in cooking; rafter material for houses from the less
productive trees. Poorer women, heading households that do not have men to climb the trees, often make products
from the fibre, especially brooms.

Because of concerns about the long-term viability of palm sugar production in the districts along the transmission
line COIs, a number of initiatives are under way to: 1) produce palm vinegar (for sale to Phnom Penh restaurants
among other end users) in place of palm sugar, because it does not require cooking; 2) providing support for new
handicrafts from the fibre, particularly different kinds of broom to find new market niches; 3) switching to other
potentially valuable cash crops, such as cashew nuts, provided sufficient technical support can be afforded
households interested in this; and 4) integrating sugar palms more fully into livestock production as an alternative to
palm sugar production, particularly pigs, through new ways of preparing livestock feed.

The latter option is being looked at in particular as a way to provide a higher income-generating alternative to palm
sugar production and to lessen the pressure on forest reserves that palm syrup cooking involves, as well as reducing
the drudgery of women's work that is another feature of the palm sugar production. New types of brooms might
be a way to help in particular poor women-headed households, who tend to be more likely engaged in this income
generating activity.

Other Economically Valuable Trees

There are about 28 varieties of economically valuable trees that are widely found along the COI, as well as an
additional 30 or so miscellaneous variety of such trees owned in very small numbers.          Such trees, including the
Sugar Palm, are found clustered around built up areas where residences are located and serve a variety of uses,
including fruit, leaves used in cooking or animal fodder, or for other purposes, building material, and shade. As
with the Sugar Palm, which is also more widely scattered among the rice fields, these various trees, which take long
years to develop, represent a considerable income investment for the APs.

It will be, however, a difficult task sorting out the income effects of loss of these trees. Some, such as banana, may
remain within the COI given height restrictions only above 3 m, and others represent income based on a variety of
factors such as age, health of tree, and so forth.

Income Restoration Strategy

A sugar palm/income restoration program study will be carried out and will be incorporated in the updated RAP.
If further investigation identifies a dependence by APs on sugar palm or other productive trees for a significant
proportion (20% or more) of their household income, a livelihood rehabilitation program will be designed prior to

                                                                                                             (77 or 75% of 102
          From the prelim.inary       field surveys of 2000,   it was reported that    the great majority
                                                                                                                           of land
          respondents) obtained       their land by distribution   from authorities. This    reflects the redistribution

          commencing from         1989, as discussed above.    Of the remaining,    5 bought their land,  7 inherited, and other

          responses were unclear.       The reported period    of ownership ranged    up to 21 years, with   a median time of 17
                                                                                                                           Rouge
          years.   This probably reflects      the time of resettlement     of people in 1979     following the Khmer

          period.

          The updating Survey        carried out in April-May    2003 indicates that,  there is a market for   buying and selling

          land, even though on       a low level of activity,and with most people     tending to stay on   their land for the long

          term. 32.    Land transactions in       Cambodia may involve       only the buyer and     seller, with recognition    of

          boundaries by neighbours,        and usually does not   involve any legal paperwork    or authorities33. A  Receipt for

          an Application for      Possession and Use     of Land may be used     as evidence of ownership      and change hands

          with the land transfer.     The 2000 AP Census      reported that, of the  3198 APs, 33% had      Certificates and 51%

           had receipts.

           Applications for Possession       and Use of Land were      reported to have been     lodged, and Receipts    for these

           held, by 91 (77%)         of 118 respondents      in the 2000-2001      Preliminary Socio-econornic      Survey.    No

           respondents had actually       obtained a Certificate ofPossessionand Use as a result   of this process. This   reflects
                                                                                                                       been cited
           the general situation   in the land-titling  program described    above. The lack of    legal land title has

           as a factor in people     losing their land in  Cambodia through      'land grabbing' and    in the high incidence   of

           land disputes in the    country.3 4


           Occupation of potentially        public land (roadside,   wetland or forest)    was identified by     11 (10%) of the
                                                                                                                        there was
           respondents in the      118 households 2000-2001        Preliminary Socio-economic      Survey. However,
                                                                                                                       considered
           some confusion about        this as other answers    from these same respondents       indicated that they

           themselves the owners       of the land in question   (8 of these held Receipts  for Applications for   Possession and

           Use of Land). Only         9 (8%) of 118 respondents      reported sharing   their land with others.     Land disputes

           were reported by      6 (5%/o)of 118 respondents.       Of these, 3 reported   seeking to resolve the    dispute at the

           village level, and 3   at the district level.

                     Findings

           Rice land was reported         as owned by 95 of      118 responses (81%)      in the 2000-2001     Preliminary Socio-

           economic Survey.        Of those that did    not own rice land,   only one owned other      farmland and 14 owned      a
                                                                                                                 with a median of
           house plot). The       area of rice land reported   ranged from 8 to 480     are 35 (0.08 to 4.8ha),

           0.5ha per land-owning        family. Other farmland     was reported as owned     by 20 of the 118 responses     (17%).

           The area of this land       ranged from 10 to     600 are (0.1 to 6ha),  with a median of 0.28ha       per land-owning

            family.

           House and associated land was reported as owned                      by 101 of 118 respondents (86%).           Of the 17 who
           reported not owning house land, 8 (47%) did                     own rice land, and 2 (12%) of these also owned other
           farmland.3    6   The area of house land reported was a median of 625m2                       (0.06ha) per family owning house

           land.

           It was reported that 35 (30%) of the families' land               holdings were fragmented or divided into smaller         blocks,
           with individual blocks ranging in size from 8 to               100 are (0.08 to lha). This reflects the division      ofrice land
           into upper, medium and lower fields as described                    above. Discussions with an agricultural development
           non-govemment organisation in Takeo and with                    the Department of Cadastre and Geography had             indicated
           rice land in the area is typically divided into pieces of            land of 0.25 to 0.5 ha.

           House construction was found from the surveys                   to be mostly of wood or thatch walls with iron or        tile roof.
           Wall material was reported as wood by 71 (66%/6)                     of 108 respondents and thatch by 25 (23%).               Roof
           material was reported as corrugated iron by 41 (40%)                  respondents, tile by 45 (42%), thatch by 17 (16%).          A
           median house size of 30m2 was reported. The number                      of rooms in each house ranged from 1 to 4, with           a

           median of 1 room.

           Land and property values reported varied widely,                 presumably due to the low level of activity in the property
           market        (as stated above, under Land Tenure in the                   Project Area, only 5% of respondents in the
           preliminary survey reported having bought                     their land, while 75% reported obtaining their              land by
            distribution from authorities). It may also be that              the value ofland sales may be under-reported for        reasons
            of security or taxation. The following were reported                   in the preliminary survey with respect to property
           values:

            *    Land values reported for rice land were in the              range of $0.20 to $20 per m2, with a median of $2.50/m2
                 for 75 responses.

            *    Land values reported for other farm land were                in the range of $0.30 to $12.50 per m2 with a median
                                                                                                                         ,                   of

                 $1/m2 for 13 responses.

            *    Land values reported for house land were in                   the range of $0.12 to $75 per m2 with a median
                                                                                                                        ,                    of
                 $1.65/m2 for the 75 responses.

            *    The main criteria influencing land value was reported as proximity                    to a main road by 87 respondents.

            *    House replacement cost reported ranged from                     $120 to $20,000 (or $6,000 if the highest figure            is
                 considered an outlier). The median reported house                 cost is $1,200.

            3.2.1.6           Importance ofSugarPalms in Takeo Province's                       Economy

            It is worth noting that the agricultural system found                 in upper Takeo has been categorized as a 'Rice          and
            Sugar Palm Complex," highlighting the importance                    of sugar palm trees as a necessary crop for providing
            families with a much needed cash income:3 This         7        is important to the RAP, as Takeo Province has by          far the
            greatest number ofAPS, with approxitnately 71% (91km)                     of the total route located in Takeo Province:

            In several rice-growing areas, subsidiary crops                play an important role. In the upper part of          Takeo (for
            instance), the rice cultivation is mainly rain fed lowland               rice, produced on poor sandy soils. These soils,
            however, are quite suitable for the sugar palm tree, which is                        an important cash crop providing many
             families with necessary cash incomes in an economy                   known as the 'rice and sugar palm complex.' It has
            been estimated that the value of sugar production                 from 20 palm trees corresponds roughly to the          value of
            rice produced on 1 ha. In 1993, rice production                 in Cambodia averaged around 1.3 tons per hectare.            Food
            consumption is equivalent to 260-270 kg of paddy                  per inhabitant per year. In Takeo, one of the         particular
            parts of the country where the soil is especially             poor and the population pressure high, around         fifty percent
             of families failed to produce enough rice for their own              consumption.

3.2.2       Socio-Economic Characteristics


            3.2.2.1         Occupations andIncomes

            By far the most common primary              occupation was farming (87% of          respondents), with rice being the main
            source of income. This is roughly             the same proportion as found for           the 3,198 AP Census, which listed
            farming in around 90% of cases           and the 698 Socio-Economic Survey.             A number of other occupations           and

            income sources were reported, including              various paid work and business activities,      interalia., some 6 drivers
            (including motos); 2 Buddhist monks;             3 merchants; 4 construction labourers;        5 village chiefs, deputy chiefs,
            or political party heads; 4 builders;       2 army personnel; and I NGO           staff.

            Reported annual household incomes                ranged from to $2,737 to only          $13, with a median of $183 and           an
            average of $249, from the PreliminaySocio-Economic               Survgy results for 118 APs.3    8  Focusing on the 125 APs

            covered by the more comprehensive              Socio-economic Survey along the          220kV COI severely affected due to
            their house requiring relocation,         the highest annual FIH income reported          was approximately $2,900.

            From total household annual income                and size of household,3     9  the highest per capita income reported           is

            $75, as indicated in the following          table. Based on the Poverty Reduction       PartnershipAgreement between the ADB
            and Cambodia (uly 2001), the most              recent estimate of the poverty line         is US$14 per person per month.
            Given this, and keeping in mind           the caution usually associated with       collecting accurate rural income figures,
            some 70% of the 125 most severely               affected APs would be classified        as at or below the national poverty
            line. The budget's 20 percent contingency               (Section 9.2) will cover the need      to include APs who are below
            the poverty line as vulnerable and             entitled to rehabilitation assistance.        The DMS will verify the exact
            numbers, and Government's loan               commitment to cover all RAP costs,          whatever they turn out to be once
            DMS is finalized, will ensure that         costs will be covered for this purpose.

          3.2.2.2          Household HeadAge, Education, Literacy

          The household head was identified as the father/husband in 90 of the 99 responses to this question (91%)
          in the 2000-2001 Preliminary Socio-Economtic Survey of 118 APs. The remaining 9 (9%) identified the
          mother/wife (not necessarily single, widowed, or divorced). This is low in comparison to that reported in
          the 1998 national census41, which indicates that 25.7% of households nationally are headed by females,
          25.4% in Kandal Province and 26.5% in Takeo Province. The high levels in Cambodia are due to loss
          particularly of young men during the years of conflict. From 1998 Census data for some 176 communes on
          either side of the 220kV and 115kV COIs, the percentage of female headed households was reported at
          2 8 %. The average sex ration was 91.4, at 681,753 females to 622,459 males.42

          Of the 698 APs surveyed by the comprehensive,                   2 2 % sample survey, some 131 AP were reported as
          headed by women, around 19% of all surveyed households.                        Likewise, of the 127 APs to be severely
          affected by relocation of their house from the COI, 24 households were reported to be female headed, or
          around 19%. While these percentages are still lower than expected, they are closer to the Provincial levels
          than the data presented in the March 2001 RRAP. In fact, the figure of 19% for female headed households
          tallies well with the combined 1998 Census data for 176 communes along the Project COI for widows
          (12.3%) and divorced and separated females (5%), which together are 17.3% of the female population.

          The household heads were reported as having a median age of 44 years in the Prelimninary Socio-economic
          Survey of 188 APs, and median level of education of seven years. The spouses of the household heads
          were reported as having a median age of 41 years, and median level of education of four years.

            The table would indicate that              head of these severely affected               APs (127 required to relocated their
            residences) have a level of education somewhat                 above that of the general population from data                  compiled
            for the 176 communes along the Project's                COI, with almost 40% having a primary                  education compared to
            22% for the general population,              nearly 20% having a lower secondary                   education (9% for the general
            population) and 13% a secondary             education (2% for the general population).

            The 1998 Census literacy rates for the              general population in the 176 communes                 along the COI are nearly
            69 % for the adult population (over 15             years), 83% for males and 57% for females.

            3.2.2.3          EthnicityandSpecialRole ofKhmer                      Women in the CambodianSocietyandEconomy

           Virtually all of the APs along the Transmission                Line COIs are reported to be Khmer.                 Two aspects of the
            role of Khmer women in Cambodian                   society and economy are relevant to the               RAP. One is that women
           inherit property, including land, the            same way that men do, and therefore                there will need to be maximum
           consultation with women in the AP households                    with regards to information about compensation                  and also
           assurance that they are adequately               represented when compensation is actually                   awarded to households.
           Ovesen et al (1996) have noted:45

                        Kinship among the Khmer is conventionally            recognized as cognatic, i.e., descent is traced       through
                        both males and females.. . [There is] a tendency         towards matrfoca/iy among the rural population,           a
                        tendency which stems from the influential                socio-economic position of the adult              woman
                        (wife/mother) in the household - which         bestows upon her the duty to provide          for her family - and
                        from the pre-eminence of uxorilocal residence,           i.e., the preference that a newly married          couple
                        should live with or nearby the bride's     parents.


                        Daughters and sons are not only equally recognized              in the kinship system, they also have equal
                        rights to shares in the property and inheritance.           The traditional system of use rights of         land in
                        Cambodia made it possible for the land          to be inherited within the family of cultivators.          Parents
                        often made the transfer of land to           children after the marriage of children,            with equal parts
                        transferred to daughters and to sons. It      was common for the son-in-law to move             in with the family
                        of the wife and to work for the father-in-law       for a certain period of time before the married         couple
                        established its own household. Among            the rural Khmer population, there           is... a preference for
                        uxorilocalresidence, that is, a married     couple will prefer to live with or nearby          the wife's parents,
                        insofar as it is practically feasible. Due     to the traditional matrifoca/iy in the rural society,      younger
                        daughters usually inherited the better       part of the rice fields, as a compensation             for caring for
                        parents in their old age.


           The second aspect of women's                 role in the Cambodian economy is                    the important role they have as
           economic decision makers in Khmer                 households and as entrepreneurs in the               market. Again, Ovesen et al
           (1996) on role of women in the            Cambodian economy:46

                        [In a] traditional Khmer world order [with]          little room for a class of professional traders           and
                       merchants.... Women and people who were              not 'pure' Khmer, notably Chinese immigrants,             have
                       traditionally largely occupied the economic        niche for merchants. Already in Ankor             times, Khmer
                       women were engaged in trade to a significant          degree... Even nowadays, relatively few          Khmer men
                       engage in trade but in recent years, Khmer          women have to an increasing degree entered             business
                       life in the cities and towns, to the extent that     the number of Khmer female traders in Phnom              Penh
                       is said to equal or even surpass that of ethnic       Chinese. There is a certain irony in the fact        that the
                       traditionally subordinate role and inferior cosmological            status of women in Khmer culture has in
                       the present economic climate made it possible         for many of them to assert themselves economically
                       with a vengeance.




45Ovesen et al (1996), pp. 53-55. Note that matrilocalityis     an anthropological term defined as being "of    or pertaining to residence with the
wife's family or tribe," as inwhen young couples    to move inwith the bride's parents where the bridegroom        would be given work. A
matriarchy in its traditional sense is a"form  ofsocial organization inwhich the mother       is head of the family and inwhich descent is
reckoned inthe female line, the children belonging     to the mother's clan." All societies and cultures   of the 19th century and earlier were
patriarchial, at least in the public domain. A form of matriarchy, better described as "matrifocality',    was well known in various cultures, such
as the Scottish matriarch who ran her household      with a loving but iron rule. There were also the proverbial    Jewish mothers who micro-
managed the minute details of their family's lives,   creating an eternal source of material for Jewish comics     like Jackie Mason. Although they
may vary insignificance and influence,     matrilineal patterns existed within all traditional communities and are worthy of study and analysis.

                   Married women have a strong position with regard to decision-making and household economy as

                   every household was in this sense a female-headed household. Observations on Khmer women as
                   resourceful and not hesitant to make use of whatever capacities they have, should be related to the
                   fact of the matrifocal bias that social life in Cambodia seems to have favoured in general. Women's
                   participation in work and economic production, in the rice fields as in the market, give them a lot
                   of both social experience and social influence, though not in any sense social independence.

          3.2.2.4       Infrastructure andServices

          Infrastructure in the Project area is poor. Travel from Phnom Penh to Takeo is via National Route 2 or
          the railway line, both of which are in poor condition. National Route 2 from Phnom Penh to Takeo is
          sealed but the pavement has many potholes and broken edges. From Takeo to the Viet Nam border the
          road is unsealed and very corrugated again with many potholes and broken edges.                    The road suffered
          significant additional damage due to flooding in the 2000 wet season, one of the heaviest wet seasons on
          record.

          Outside of the main urban areas of Phnom Penh and Takeo, there is no reticulated electricity supply and
          domestic water supply is from ponds and wells. However many people do use electricity in the form of car
          batteries for selected uses including lighting and television.


3.2.3    Vulnerable Groups


Both ADB and World Bank require that particular attention be paid to vulnerable groups among people affected                by
the project. Vulnerable groups are those who, for a variety of reasons, may be less able to deal with the disturbance
caused by the project and adapt to new situations.                Examples include the poor, disabled, landless, households
headed by women, elderly or children, returnees and indigenous or other ethnic minorities.

Only six families interviewed in the prelimninary socio-economic survey of 118 APs identified themselves as
belonging to one of the nominated vulnerable groups (one woman head of household, two returnees, and                     three
disabled). As the table below shows, however, the various identified vulnerable groups in the more comprehensive
socio-economic survey were over one quarter of the total APs surveyed (698 APs) and almost a third of the severely
affected APs that is those whose structures would be relocated.

This data will need to be reassessed at the time of the DMS, however, as some of these 'vulnerable' households are
shown in the database to have among the highest incomes reported, as is the case with one of the female-headed
households where the head is listed as a nurse by occupation and one of the 'disabled' is a retired Colonel.

On the other hand, it is also clear that many if not most of those listed as vulnerable among the more severely
affected APs will need special assistance. While some 8 of the female-headed households were above the poverty
line (at $14 per capita per month), the rest, or 94%, were below this poverty line.

Resettlement Unit                                                                     Final Version January 2005




                   6 RELOCATION AND REHABILITATION

6.1       REPLACEMENT LAND AND HOUSES

The ADB and World Bank requirements           specify that the preferred form of   compensation for involuntarily acquired
land is provision of replacement      land nearby of equivalent type,     size and value with similar access    to livelihood
opportunities. An exception to      the 'land for land' rule is made in  the case of small areas of land (say  less than 0%
                                                                                                                         2

of the owner's total productive land       holdings), where cash compensation      is acceptable.    In this case the project
affected family's land base, as its primary source of income remains      substantially viable. In this case the AP must be
provided with independent counselling       and advice in the management of their     compensation payment and the long-
term maintenance or improvement        of their livelihood. This may be    due to a number of factors such   as:

  * Inexperience of the PAPs in managing         a large amount of money over      time. This can result in compensation
    money being used for other purposes.         The PAPs is then left without enough      money to purchase replacement
    land or house and being left without    a livelihood or accommodation.

  * Rise in the cost of land or building   between the calculation of compensation     and the purchase ofland.

  * People being cheated or tricked    out of their compensation payment.

  * People being pressured to use    the compensation payment

  * People being pressured to use      the compensation payment to       repay outstanding debt, at the expense      of their
    long-term livelihood. There is a    high level of debt in rural areas in Cambodia

  * Robbery

  * Other payments

As previously stated, the need for   replacement land and houses arises in    this Project as follows:

* Permanent acquisition of land      for transmission towers, substations    and roads

* Remove of houses from COI, in the          case where the house cannot be relocated      on the same block of land, thus
    requiring relocation to a new block of land.      (In this case the land itself is not required  for the Project, but the
    house and other structures need to be        removed from the COI for safety reasons.           The land would remain
    available for other activities such as farming   and ground crops.

There thus arises the need to provide      suitable replacement land as part of the    Project. The provision of 'land for
land' is however always a difficult problem     in a location where all the useful land   is already occupied. Therefore a
number of options have been considered        to achieve the ADB's and World Bank's      objective the standard of living of
PAPs be maintained or enhanced as a result       of the Project.

6.1.1    Transmission Towers and Poles

In the case of 220kV transmission line      the area of land for each tower is approximately        lOOm2. This is small in
relation to the typical size of each piece of land (around 0.25ha or 2,500m2) and      total landholding per farming family
(around lha). For the 115kV line from        West Phnom Penh to the existing       115kV line around Phnom Penh, each
pole will occupy approximately 4 m2, thus      the same principle would apply. Therefore        this marginal impact will be
compensated in cash at the market      price for land. The total area for the 220kV       transmission towers and for the
115kV poles will be less than 4 ha.

6.1.2    Substations

For the substations, approximately 3 ha are     required at West Phnom Penh and        1.5 ha at Takeo, plus approximately
0.7 for access roads. The land at these    sites is used for rice growing with each   farmer typically holding a number of
scattered blocks of land, each with     an area typically in the order of 0.25ha.      The substation sites will therefore
occupy a part of the land of several   farmers, in the order of 0% of the total
                                                                  5                agricultural land holding of each of the

                                                              66

Resettlement Unit                                                                             Final Version January2005


farmers.     The land at these locations is already      intensively farmed for rice and vacant land       is not available.
Furthermore, the farmers have expressed their preference        for cash.

Village authorities have indicated that land    is being bought and sold in their villages.     The RAP implementation
team will undertake further consultation    with these affected people during DMS in        order to confirm that options
are available to purchase land. In addition,  farmers will be provided advice and technical    assistance.

6.1.3     House Land

In the case of replacement land being required     for of houses that have to be removed from       the COI, surveys have
so far been unable to locate suitable replacement       land. It is necessary to provide these APs      with an equivalent
standard of housing in the same village and     with the same access to livelihood opportunities.       In order to achieve
this it will be necessary to purchase some    other land and develop it for housing. This     will most commonly involve
purchasing rice growing land and filling to   raise the ground level to enable it to be kept  well drained. This land will
be purchased by the Project where more than       eight households will be relocating in one area or    the APs him or her
self from willing sellers.   The appropriate action will need to be        determined on a case-by-case basis during    the
Project design stage and with NGOs involved         in the Project's income restoration program      acting, along with the
RAP and Environmental Coordinator (RPEC)           as AP advocates in the process. The cost      of residential replacement
plots is included in the RAP budget, along     with a land filling allowance for raising land    to an acceptable level for
residential purposes.


6.1.4     Replacement Houses

The need for replacement of houses arises       where houses need to be removed from the           COI for safety reasons.
Replacement houses are to be provided to        an equivalent size and standard within the       same village, with similar
access to resources and facilities such as    land, roads and livelihood opportunities.       Materials from the existing
structure are to be available to the owner      for salvage with no deduction from the compensation            value.  Cash
compensation sufficient to replace materials      and labour to build replacement houses        to an equivalent size and
standard will be given to APs, and there will      be no deduction for depreciation, taxes,     stamp duty, fees or other
payments. The land within the COI from         which the house has been removed is suitable         for other uses such as
farming of ground crops and will remain accessible      to the original owner.

Aside from tower pads, the land will not     be required for the Project and therefore will    remain the property of the
previous occupant.      APs will be given cash payment for their           houses and will organize the relocation and
construction of new houses on their own.         Where more than eight households require         houses in one area, the
Project will provide a serviced resettlement   site, if so preferred by the APs. Where vulnerable       APs require special
assistance, the Project will organize suitable direct assistance, such as providing materials   and hiring a contactor, for
replacing houses, at an equivalent or better  standard.

Owners generally construct their own houses        with assistance from family and others     in the village. With this in
mind, costs and allowances will be, for those   who choose to build their own homes, as follows:


         *    Payment of compensation in cash or materials       at full replacement cost at current market value,  with no
              deduction in compensation for depreciation      or salvageable materials.

         *    Allowances for the expense of relocation      of family and possessions to a replacement    house, based on
              standard RGC rates.

         *    Allowances the cost of living and disturbance     during the re-establishment period, based on     a monthly
              cost of providing for the family food and    living costs determined through percentage    of annual income
              (high end estimate), of US$40 or equivalent        to 40 kg of rice per household for three      (3) months,
              whichever is greater, will be provided to relocating   APs.

                          7 INCOME RESTORATION STRATEGY

7.1        INCOME LOSSES

7.1.1      Substation Land

Severely Affected Persons (SAPs) are identified as the 15 APs losing land to the two substations, WWP (8 APs
losing 4.5 ha riceland) and TSS (12 APs losing 1.5 ha riceland).                      Substation land acquisition will be fully
compensated and allowances given for income losses (see Entitlement Matrix, Table 4-2). Severely affected farmers
(losing 0% or more of total productive landholding) will be entitled to other rehabilitation assistance, including
         2

advice and technical assistance to improve productivity on remaining land or to develop alternative livelihoods. The
income restoration program (Section 7.2) applies to substation SAPs as well as to those on the transmission line
alignments.

7.1.2      Structure Relocation

Some 145 APs required to relocate their homes from the 220kV and 115kV transmission line COIs (127 APs on the
220kV Line and 18 APs on the 115kV Line), about 40% will likely be able to move to another location on the same
plot of land and 0% required to relocate within their viflage and for whom the Project will have to provide a new
                       6

plot of land and cost of fll to raise the land for residential purpose. As with land acquisition for substations, all
land acquisition along the transmission line COIs will be fully compensated and allowances given for income losses
(see Entitlement Matrix, Table 4-2). There is one commercial scale chicken farm that will be affected at Krang
Chake village, requiring the relocation of a chicken shed within the same site. No other businesses will be affected.

7.1.3      Trees

The requirement of moving trees from the transmission line COIs may be the largest direct income loss for
individual APs. However, it is very difficult at this stage to assess the income loss, either more broadly or for an
individual AP. This can be done once the lines are 'pegged out' upon finalization of the design and the carrying out
of the Detailed Measurement Survey (DMS) that will update and finalize in the information about APs and the
specific Project impacts.

It is possible, however, to make a general assessment of the income loss that is possibly involved in removing trees
from the COI. Tables 2-6 and 2-10 indicate the trees so far identified along the 220kV and 115kV COIs. It is a
very general estimate of trees that may require relocation.

            (a)        SugarPalm (Borassus flabellifer)
           There are by far more Sugar Palms, Thnot in Khmer, likely to be removed from the Transmission Line
           COIs than any other type of tree, about           4 0  % of all trees along the 220kV Line and around 36% of trees
           likely to fall within the 115kV Line. Some 488 APs were reported to have about 2,769 Sugar Palm trees
           possibly affected by the 200kV COI, nearly 6 trees per household where trees owned per household may
           vary from 10-30,62 so that conceivable loss is, somewhat theoretically at this point, on the order of 20-60%,
           depending on final design and actual number of trees requiring to be removed from the COI.

           Ovesen et al (1996) have categorized the agricultural system found in upper Takeo as a 'Rice and Sugar
           Palmn Complex," highlighting the importance of Sugar Palm trees as a necessary crop for providing families
           with a much needed cash income:           6 3



                       In several rice-growing areas, subsidiary crops play an important role.      In the upper part of Takeo [for
                       instance], the rice cultivation is mainly rainfed lowland rice, produced on poor sandy soils.     These soils,
                       however, are quite suitable for the sugar paln tree, which is an important cash crop providing many families

Resettlement Unit                                                                                       Final Version January2005



                    with necessary cash incomes in an economy known as the 'rice and sugar palm complex.' It has been
                    estimated that the value of sugar production from 20 palm trees corresponds roughly to the value of rice
                    produced on 1 ha.      In 1993, rice production in Cambodia averaged around 1.3 tons per hectare.            Food
                    consumption is equivalent to 260-270 kg of paddy per inhabitant per year. In Takeo, one of the particular
                    parts of the country where the soil is especially poor and the population pressure high, around fifty percent
                    of families failed to produce enough rice for their own consumption.


         The Sugar Palm, tapped for its juice during the dry season, starting in December or January right after
          paddy harvest and finishing at the time of plantation of the paddy seedbeds in May or June provides about
          equal or even more income to farmers as rice farming during the wet season. For instance, in Oudong
          District, Kampon Speu Province, where about 50% of families are palm sugar producers, rice was
          estimated to produce around US$190,000 annually, while palm sugar was estimated, depending on selling
          price (350-600 riels/kg) to earn $125-220,000 per annum district-wide.               64  Men generally collect the sap and
          women undertake the more strenuous tasks of collecting wood for cooking the palm syrup and the other
          tasks involved in processing.

          Unfortunately, the price for sugar derived from the palm sugar collapsed in 1999 due to the competition of
          white sugar and the end of exports to Vietnam. In Oudong District, some 40% of palm sugar producers
          ceased production, leading to exodus of many to Phnom Penh. Further, concerns have been raised about
          the pressure on forest resources from palm sugar production, for which about 4 kg of fuel wood is
          estimated, required to produce 1 kg of palm syrup.6          5  Palm Sugar trees take about 20 years to reach maturity
          for producing sap and produce for up to another 80 years in many cases.

          Other sources of income from Sugar Palms are: (a) making products from Sugar Palm fibre, for which only
          the younger trees are suitable, such as brooms and other handicrafts; roofing, and wall materials from the
          leaves; fruit, which is eaten or used in cooking; rafter material for houses from the less productive trees.               66

          Poorer women, heading households that do not have men to climb the trees, often make products from the
          fibre, especially brooms.

          Because of concerns about the long-term viability of palm sugar production in the Districts along the
          Transmission Line COIs, a number of initiatives are under way to: 1) produce palm vinegar (for sale to
          Phnom Penh restaurants among other end users) in place of palm sugar, because it does not require
          cooking; 2) providing support for new handicrafts from the fibre, particularly different kinds of broom to
          find new market niches; 3) switching to other potentially valuable cash crops, such as cashew nuts,
          provided sufficient technical support can be afforded households interested in this; and 4) integrating sugar
          palms more fully into livestock production as an alternative to palm sugar production, particularly pigs,
          through new ways ofpreparing livestock feed.

          The latter option is being looked at in particular as a way to provide a higher income-generating alternative
          to palm sugar production and to lessen the pressure on forest reserves that palm syrup cooking involves, as
          well as reducing the drudgery of women's work that is another feature of the palm sugar production. New
          types of brooms might be a way to help in particular poor women-headed households, who tend to be
          more likely engaged in this income generating activity

          The current status of dependence upon sugar palms by APs is under review and will be confirmed prior to
          finalising the RAP prior to appraisal. If it is determined that APs are dependent on the sugar palm or other
          productive trees for a significant proportion (ie 20% or more) of their household income, a livelihood
          rehabilitation program will be designed.

          As can be seen in Tables 2-6 and 2-10, there are about 30 varieties of economically                  valuable trees that are
          widely found along the COI, as well as an additional 30 or so miscellaneous variety of                 such trees owned in
          very small numbers. Such trees, including the Sugar Palm, are found clustered                 around built up areas where
          residences are located and serve a variety of uses, including fruit, leaves used in cooking or animal fodder,
          or for other purposes, building material, and shade. As with the Sugar Palm,                    which is also more widely
          scattered among the rice fields, these various trees, which take long years to                       develop, represent a
          considerable income investment for the APs.

          It will be, however, a difficult task sorting out the income effects of loss of these                trees. Some, such as
          banana, may remain within the COI given height restrictions only above 3 m, and others represent income
          based on a variety of factors such as age, health of tree, and so forth.


7.1.4     Temporary Disturbance

In addition to the income losses from permanent land acquisition, there will be income losses from temporary
disturbances during implementation. Most of these will be compensated for by the Project, such as crop losses                       due
to construction activities, and by the contractors, as according to contract provisions, where the impacts are directly
caused by their activities. It is important for the contractors to take this responsibility so that they will have ample
incentive to keep such impacts at a minimum.

7.2       STRATEGY FOR INCOME RESTORATION

A sugar palm/income restoration program study will be carried out and will be incorporated in the updated RAP.
If further investigation identifies a dependence by APs on sugar palm or other productive trees for a significant
proportion (2 0% or more) of their household income, a livelihood rehabilitation program will be designed prior to
finalizing the RAP. It is proposed to set up an income restoration strategy/program that is flexible enough to
handle a wide range of contingencies, i.e., through the creation of a revolving micro-enterprise loan fund (MLF)
that can be accessed by NGOs already working in communities along COI. This will require the                       active consultation
with EDC, with these locally involved NGOs, with the above technical consultant expert on sugar palms and other
economic trees (and on various programs being proposed fro alternative income generation program                         based on the
proposed MLF). It is estimated that the study will take 1 to 2 months.

The 2000-2001 Socio-Economic Survey noted a number of NGOs and other organizations working in the villages
along the COI. Among these are the Lutheran World Service (LWS),6 which supports a number of Integrated
                                                                                       7

Rural Development Projects (IRDPs) particularly in Kandal and Takeo Provinces, which together form the greater
part of the 220kV COI. The European Union (EU) supported Support Programme for the Agriculture Sector in
Cambodia (PRASAC) has undertaken similar project in the COI villages, as have a variety of other organizations,
including UNICEF, the World Food Program (WFP), Integrated Pest Management (IMP), Social Fund of the
Kingdom of Cambodia, Catholic Relief Services, Pour Thom elderly Association (PTEA), GRET (supporting
'Ennatien Moulethan Tchonebatt, Khmer for 'rural lending,' or EMT, which is doing micro-financing), and AC Lida,
which previously was an NGO but now does primarily commercial lending in the COI villages.

 8.2      IMPLEMENTING AGENCY

 The organisation responsible          for the implementation of           the Project, including the          RAP and environmental

 requirements, is Electricite      du Cambodge (EDC). A             Royal Decree in March 1996            established EDC as a wholly

 state-owned, limited liability      enterprise6 . Before 1996,
                                                8                      EDC operated as a Government               Department under the

 direction of the Ministry        of Industry, Mines and         Electricity (MIME).         Currently, MIME and the             Ministry of

 Economy and Finance (MEF)             jointly own EDC. Hence            it is under their overall supervision          and joint control.

 MIME will have overall responsibility          for implementation of the         Project. The Ministry of Economy              and Finance

 (MEF) will fund the implementation              of the RAP, and EDC will,             in coordination with relevant           agencies and

 guidance of the IRC, manage            and supervise the overall         Project, including Resettlement           activities.   EDC will

 establish a permanent Environment             and Resettlement Office            staffed with qualified social        and environmental

 specialists.

 8.3      INTERMINISTERIAL RESETTLEMENT                                     COMMITTEE

 As originally agreed between           the World Bank (prior           to the ADB's assumption             of funding for the 200kV

 component), MEF and EDC              an Inter-Ministerial Resettlement         Committee (IRC) was established           30 January 2001

 for "investigation and assessment        of the impact on the structures,         households and land properties         belonging to the

 citizens who live within the      COI of the Transmission        line from Phnom Penh toward            the boundary of Viet Nam        and

 Cambodia via Takeo as part         of the national Transmission        System in the Southern part          of Cambodia. The 'Decision'

 document signed by the Prime         Minister appointed the following          as members (list includes      current replacements):69

8.4      COMMUNE COUNCILS

During RAP implementation,     Commune Councils of      the affected communities   will play a key role in facilitating and

coordinating with the RAP     team. They will help to    organize public meetings    and consultations, guide     the RAP

team during the Detailed Measurement      Survey's (DMS's) revalidating   inventory, facilitate in conflictresolution and

witness with signature the agreed inventory list of affected assets of each household.


8.5      PROJECT MANAGEMENT                   OFFICENUMBERS 1               & 2

Project Management Office       (PMOs I & 2) within       EDC will have overall      responsibility for the design      and

construction of the Project  including, as agreed in  a Memorandum of Understanding        (MOU) with ADB and World
Bank signed February 2003,      the management and implementation        of the RAP. The IRC,        of which EDC is a

member, will be responsible    for approving the compensation      rates that will be finalized  by the RAPEC together

with EDC and the Local       Sub-Committees.      The PMOs will be established       on the same basis as      the Project

Management Unit (PMU),      which is currently in charge   of Project preparation,  and the PMOs will be set up       upon

ADB and World Bank approval       of the Project. The PMOs     will be staffed on a full time basis and will be dissolved
after the Project is handed  over to the EDC. Figures      8-1 and 8-2 show the organizational      structures of the two

PMOs. An in-house advisor       and the Project Implementation    Consultant (PIC) will support    EDC in the execution
 of the Project. The official   supervision of the contractors   will be the responsibility   of the Resident Engineers,

 representing the PIC.

 The specific responsibilityfor land acquisition, compensation    payments and resolution of     individual grievances lies

 with the Project Managers  for the respective PMOs (1 &    2) for the ADB and World      Bank-financed components       of

 the Project. PIC experts,  including technical, resettlement, and environment will support      the Project Manager. An

 RAP and Environment Coordinator        (RAPEC Consultant) will     be appointed to coordinate      the activities required

 under the RAP. The RAPEC         will report to the Project  Manager (Project Implementation        Consultant). As the

 RAPEC Consultant is a     part time function, a Local  Counterpart RPEC will     be appointed as a full time   member of

 the team.

 An Independent Monitoring       Organization (IMO) will monitor      the work of the above resettlement      group. The

 IMO will monitor the resettlement    and compensation process    to verify and ensure that   the ADB and World Bank's
 objectives are met. This organization  will also be involved in the complaints and grievance     resolution procedures to
 ensure concerns raised by Project  Affected Families are addressed.   See Section 8.1. for further  discussion.

8.7      DESIGN AND CONSTRUCTION                         CONTRACTOR

The Design and Construction        Contractor will be responsible for   ensuring that construction    is carried in a manner

 that ensures the implementation        of the RAP and environmental         requirements.     This includes preparing      a

 Construction EMP detailing     how this will be achieved.


The Survey and Design Teams          have a responsibility to seek   to site and design the Project     in such a way as to

 minimise impacts, consistent with    the technical and economic    objectives. The RAPEC, recruited       as part of the PIC

 team, will participate in finalizingthe alignments to minimize resettlement    impacts.


 8.8      PROJECT IMPLEMENTATION                       CONSULTANT


 A Project Implementation Consultant       (PIC) will be appointed early in the  Project to take overall responsibility   for

 the Project.    The Project Implementation          Consultant will be responsible     for ensuring that the RAP         and

 environmental requirements      are fully implemented including    ensuring the resolution of any      issues that may arise

 between this and other aspects     of the Project. The PIC    will hire and supervise the   RAPEC. It will also hire and

 provide technical assistance and   logistical support to the IMO   as required to do its work.



 8.8.1    RAP/Environmental         Coordinator (the RAPEC       Consultant)



 An RAP/Environmental        Coordinator (RAPEC) will       be appointed to coordinate     the activities required under the

 RAP and implementation         of environmental requirements.      The RAP Coordinator shall         report to the Project

 Manager (Project Implementation      Consultant, i.e., the 'ProjectEngineer'). No resettlement activities    will begin until

 after the RAPEC and his or her     domestic counterpart and GIS/Database       specialist have been mobilized.

As most of the implementation       social and environmental      issues will revolve around  involuntary resettlement,   the

RAPEC will need to be a    specialist in involuntary   resettlement and will provide    'hands on' capacity building training

to EDC in implementing        the RAP and to both EDC            staff and NGO involved      in monitoring and evaluation

activities. The RAPEC shall,    among other activities:

          *  Update, implement and      monitor the RAP;

          *  Establish and implement      a resettlement data management       system including procedures   for the accurate

             recording of all affected persons     by means of DMS and census;

          *  In coordination with       local authorities ensure     that APs are informed      of their entitlements, and

             implement information campaigns         and stakeholder participation;

          *  Establish and implement       procedures to minimize adverse     social impacts from land  acquisition and loss

             of other assets throughout      the planning, design and    implementation phases   (e.g. validation of drainage

             design to ensure they are    appropriate for local conditions).

          *  Establish and implement       procedures for undertaking     and completing census and    detailed measurement

             survey (DMS);

          *  Prepare budget for RAP       activities;

          *  Organize and carry out       specific studies, such as  Trees Cost Assessment and Income Impacts and Remediation

             Stu   andSubstationLandFillStu,j;

           * Establish and implement          procedures for the coordination         of compensation, resettlement,      and

             rehabilitation activities on   the various components;

           *  Design and implement        detailed income restoration      programs for APs severely     affected by loss of

             income (i.e. by loss of business     or loss of20% or more of     household income from     affected agricultural

              land, or trees);

           *  Supervise the implementation       of rehabilitation measures;

           *  Establish and implement      procedures for tracking    compliance to Project policies;

           *  Establish and implement        procedures for the prompt       implementation of corrective     actions and the

              resolution ofgrievances     in coordination with concerned     Government agencies;

           *  In coordination with local     authorities and the GRC,     assure that grievances about resettlement activities

              are satisfactorily redressed;

           *  Establish and implement        liaison mechanisms to      ensure proper technical    and logistical support to

              PMOs, Project Managers        and teams, resettlement    sub-committees;

           *  Establish and implement      procedures for ongoing     internal monitoring; and

           *  Supervise external monitoring       agency activities and ensure    that the Terms of Reference     are properly

              and effectively achieved

 Successful implementation      of the RAP will require       close coordination between     the PMOs and the Provincial,

 District and Commune authorities.        These together may be     deemed to be an RAP Working       Group, and the RAPEC

 will have the responsibility  for facilitating the coordination   between these.

monitored by the    IMO. The Committee               will have as members,    representatives of the   following:


          *   PMO 1&2/EDC

          *   IRC

          *   IMO

          *   Local Leader in each         Village/Local Area

          *   Local NGO

The community consultation            program will provide         contact details for   submission of complaints      and grievances.

This shall include   a phone contact and          address for written    submissions. However,     as this is not a practical means of

 communication for      many people in remote             areas, it will also be necessary to establish     an appropriate alternative
                                                                                                           People shall also  have the
 avenue for people    who are illiterate or         for whom these are      not appropriate avenues.70

 option of contacting     the IMO should they          wish the local authority  or their local Member     of Parliament.

 There will be no   fees or charges required           of those wishing to    have a complaint    heard. If any payments     are made,

 then the fee shall    be refunded by the            Project.   Other costs incurred      by legitimate complainants      shall also be

 refunded by the Project.       Follow up checks        of this shall be included  in the scope of the   IMO.

 An Independent Monitoring           Organisation 1MO)         shall be appointed    to monitor the resettlement
                                                                                                                     resettlement and
 process and implementation            of environmental       requirements to    and verify that compensation,

 rehabilitation have    been implemented          in accordance with      the agreed RAP.     The IMO will also     be involved in the

 complaints and grievance        procedures to ensure        concerns raised by    APs are addressed.      This has been adopted    for

 the road projects carried      out in Cambodia recently.
                                                                                                                                      it
 It is important that     the IMO chosen for           this has a good relationship      with the government.     At the same time

 needs to be able to       maintain a strong        independent position      and provide constructive      feedback to the project

 ensure the objectives       are met. The IMO           must also have good     local knowledge of     people in the project   area and

 have, or be able to      provide, representation         at the local level.  Provision shall be     made in the project    for further

 8.11      CAPACITY BUILDING/INSTITUTIONAL                                     STRENGTHENING


 Capacity building    and other assistance        will be incorporated    into the project for  the implementing    agency and for the

  IMO. Currently EDC           has four engineers        who received technical     training in 1999 in    environmental management

 under a World Bank         TA, during the Phnom          Penh Power Rehabilitation       Project, to establish its environmental unit.

 The capacity building       was conducted by SMEC            and included the 'essential   principles of environmental    management

  which are widely   accepted in today's         world:'

Only one of the originally trained  engineers is currently working in   environmental management activities     at EDC.

The others are all assigned tasks  in other areas within the corporation.    The setting up of the resettlement    group

within EDC will, therefore, require considerable initial training in resettlement and environmental management.

The RAP Coordinator (Consultant)     will prepare a Capacity Building   Plan early in the implementation of   the Project.

Training shall be throughout     the assignment and will be        'hands on' including awareness     of the social and

environment requirements of the Project     for all EDC personnel and management       whose activities and decisions can
affect the social and environmental outcomes     of the Project.

For initiating the capacity building activities, the RAPEC Consultant     will prepare and carry out a   3 day workshop

for EDC staff, the IMO and   local authorities that will cover, among other things:

         *   Resettlement Principles and   Policy (including those of ADB    and World Bank)

         *   Resettlement Planning Procedures (Including     Land Acquisition and Compensation)

         *   Resettlement Implementation     Procedures and Management

         *   Methodology for Compensation       Assessment

         *   Data Management System (Focus        on Existing GIS Database Prepared     During Feasibility Studies)

         *   Public Participation and Community Consultation

         *   Design and Supervision of both Internal     and Independent Monitoring, as well    as External Auditing and

             Post Project Evaluation Methodology

         *   Specialist Technical Advice,  as seen to be required and  as appropriate.

 This will be followed up  by separate workshops held     in the Province(s) specifically  for the Provincial and District

 Sub-Committees.

9.1      BASIS OF COMPENSATION                    COST ESTIMATE


The compensation rates     for the various categories  were based from ADB       Primary Roads Improvement         Project in

Cambodia. However,      the said rates were based   on 1999 rates; therefore,  a 12% adjustment was      applied for various

losses (3% increases  per year for four years).   These are 2003 cost   estimates only and will   be adjusted upward at   the

time of Detailed Measurement      Survey to reflect the current market value  at the time of compensation.


9.1.1    Business Impact.

Al affected shops or   businesses will be compensated     at full replacement cost  without deduction     for depreciation or
                                                                                                                      of rice
salvageable materials  for affected structures  and other fixed assets.   A rate of US$40 or      equivalent to 40kg

per household for three    (3) months, for business    that will be required  to close down during     the relocation period

will be provided in   a lump sum amount       to any small shops while     big businesses have    to provide their business

income statement.    For employees, cash     compensation for lost  wages for each day they     cannot work while business

is reorganising at new  site.


 9.1.2   Temporary Construction         Impacts.


 Crop damage during       construction and interference      with field preparation     and planting: The      rate used for

 compensation for rice   crop damage is dependent       on a number of factors,    especially the yield   of rice (tonnes per

 hectare) and the market   price for the rice.

                                                                                                                          and
      a. Rice yields vary with    soil type, farming practices   (such as irrigation, fertiliser, and field preparation)

         quality of seed. A    rice yield of 2.5t/ha  of paddy rice, with   one crop per year,    has been adopted for     the

         compensation estimate     for the wet season lowland    rice growing, which   is the main form in   the project area.

         There is some dry    season recession rice   growing practiced   in the far southern    part of the project area, for

         which a higher yield   of 5t/ha has been adopted.


      b. A crop value of    US$200/t has been     used in the cost estimate.  A range of prices has    been reported, which

         may be due to variability   between times ofyear.

                                                                                                         related farm work,
      c.  Construction activity   will damage crops      and interfere with    field preparation and

          depending on the      timing of construction    with respect to    timing of farm work.         It is possible that

          construction could   be timed to avoid damage;    however this would     be difficult to manage   and may increase

          the cost of construction.   In addition the cost and complexity ofmonitoring       would significantly  increase.


             i.    It is inevitable that    the contractor will    damage fields, bund      walls, etc during    construction.

                   However, the contract      will require that the  contractor make good       any damage incurred    during

                   construction.


            ii.    The contractor will    carry out repairs to  other infrastructure.   This will be built  into the contract

                   requirements.    For local public roads,   such as village roads    damaged by the transport      of heavy

                   equipment such as     transformers into   the substations, it has been assumed that      5km of road will

                   need to be repaired   at a nominal rate of US$2/linear metre.

                The estimate has been based                                                         on conservative assumptions                                       that construction of every                                      tower will impact

                 the growing season in one                                                 year and that the contractor                                       will create a 3 m wide access                                     road the full length

                 majority of the tasks that                                             will impinge on farm land                                    in the fallow season so                            that little compensation will

                 be required.

    d.  Compensation for on-going                                                      impacts during maintenance                                             activity has not been included                                           in the costing as

        this is outside the scope                                          of the project implementation.                                                 Cost of ongoing maintenance                                            would be expected

        to be small, consisting of                                             possible damage to crops                                     and ground while accessing                                          the line. This should be

The total costs of compensation                                                     for the Project, Incremental                                                Administration for IRC                                    Working Group and

Summary Fee Cost for IMO                                      are estimated at US$2,037,991.49                                                   with a 20% contingency.

adjustment was applied for                                    various types of losses                                       (3% increases per year for                                 four years).                          These are 2003 cost

estimates only and will                            be adjusted upward at the                                                 time of Detailed Measurement                                            Survey to reflect the current
