DECORIS OIL PALM PROJECT
I. THE AGRICULTURAL SECTOR
A. Background
1.01      Liberia.  The total area of Liberia is 111,400 sq km, of which
6,200 sq km are used for agriculture. Total population is about 1.7 million;
average density is about 15 per sq km.  Soils are generally fertile and the
climate is suitable for a variety of field and tree crops. Almost 60% of
the population or 160,000 families are classified as agricultural households.
Average family size is about 6-7 per household.
1.02      Economic Trends.  Liberia has a highly dualistic economy; its
primarily agricultural economy co-exists with a foreign controlled enclave
sector dominated by iron ore mining. The enclave sector is export-oriented
and produces, besides iron ore, rubber and forest products. It provides
about 70% of export earnings, generates about 25% GDP, and 15% of all Govern-
ment revenues. Iron ore is the major export earner since the major cash
crops, rubber, coffee, and cocoa, contribute less than 10% to GDP and only 15%
to export earnings. The weakness of Liberia's open and narrowly based economy
became very evident over the last three years. The decline in demand for iron
and steel products in the industrial world was felt hard in Liberia as iron
ore production fell by more than 30% during this period. This has had consid-
erable adverse effects on the growth of GDP, balance of payments and government
revenues. GDP growth rate averaged about 5% per year between 1967 and 1974;
however, it dropped to about 1% in 1975, and preliminary estimates indicate
that it will not exceed 1.6% per year between 1977 and 1978. There has been
an upward trend in the contribution to GDP of the agriculture, forestry and
services sectors, but this was insufficient to offset the poor performance of
the iron ore sector. There was a sharp decline in the resource balance from a
surplus of US$91.0 million in 1974 to deficits estimated at US$32.0 million in
1977. Government of Liberia (GOL) is extremely concerned with the above
trends. It is therefore making a serious effort to diversify the economy and
is emphasizing development of its export-oriented tree crop production.
1.03      Population growth is about 3.3% per annum; about 2.9% is due to
natural growth and 0.4% to migration from outside. In recent years urban
population has grown by about 6% per annum, due to heavy migration from
rural areas. About 40% of the population is under 15 years of age. The
structural imbalance in the economy between the modern sector and the tradi-
tional sector is also reflected in the employment and income data. Agricul-
ture provides employment for about 73% of the total labor force of 650,000,
about 32% of whom are women; industry employs about 14%. Employment by
mining companies is negligible. Rubber concessions employ about 7% of the
total labor force or about 20% of the total labor force in the modern sector.



-2-
Income distribution is sharply skewed. Overall average per capita GNP is
about US$460 per annum, but about 55% of households, mainly rural, have annual
incomes of US$100 or less while 5% have annual incomes of US$2,500 and above.
B. Sector Characteristics
1.04      Three distinct types of farming operations exist:  (a) concession
farms: large foreign-owned plantations, 3,000 ha to 38,000 ha in size,
producing exclusively for exports; (b) Liberian-owned commercial farms:
farms, 20 ha to 200 ha in size, engaged primarily in rubber production but
with secondary interests in coffee, cocoa and oil palm; (c) traditional
farms: small farmers cultivating at any one time 2 ha to 3.5 ha of land,
mainly for home consumption. The latter comprises over 90% of all households
in agriculture. In addition there is the Liberia Sugar Corporation (LIBSUCO),
which produces for the domestic market. The principal cash crops are rubber,
coffee and cocoa. Rubber production is currently about 80,000 metric tons,
about 70% of which is produced by six concessions on about 60,000 ha, the
rest by about 5,400 Liberian farmers. Average yields on concession farms are
2-3 times those on Liberian farms. Annual production of coffee is about
10,000 tons from about 30,000 ha. About 3,500 tons of cocoa are produced
from about 9,500 ha.
1.05      Rice and cassava are the main crops of traditional farmers, pro-
ducing about 250,000 tons of rice from 215,000 ha and about 155,000 tons of
cassava from 36,000 ha. Livestock development is negligible. Total cattle
population is estimated at 7,300; sheep: 11,500; and pigs: 10,500. Crops of
traditional farms are generally low yielding.  Farmers have little access to
capital and agricultural inputs and operate in an environment with minimal
infrastructure. Coffee and cocoa are small farmers' main cash crops.  They
also harvest fruit from wild oil palm.
C. Sector Objectives, Strategies and Constraints
1.06      Objectives.  The five-year National Socio-Economic Development Plan
(1976-1980) attaches priority to agriculture and rural development, and is
considered to be the cornerstone of GOL's development strategy. Its objectives
are to diversify and modernize agricultural production, increase productivity,
improve associated rural economic activities such as marketing and processing,
and provide social and other basic infrastructure.  GOL aims at achieving
balanced development, participation of the entire population in the development
efforts, and a more equitable distribution in benefits of economic growth.
1.07      Strategies.  The strategy for agricultural development involves:
(i) establishment and operation of large industrial estates
with associated smallholder participation for oil palm,
coconuts, and sugar cane production; these would be
run by public sector corporations;



- 3 -
(ii) encouragement of smallholder rubber, coffee and cocoa
production;
(iii) implementation of integrated agricultural development
projects to raise the productivity, income and living
conditions of traditional farmers; and
(iv) implementation of several "special projects" such
as the rice program which features fully mechanized land
clearing and cultivation of cleared areas by smallholders.
The undesirability of pursuing the fourth strategy is now appreciated by
Government since it has led to uneconomic investments in two large projects
aimed at increasing rice production. Government is now placing emphasis on
rural development projects based on modified versions of the Bank assisted
Lofa and Bong Projects (para 1.09).  However, it is recognized that large-scale
tree-crop estates can make an important contribution to expansion of exports
and Government revenues, provided they are properly designed and managed. The
proposed export-oriented Decoris Oil Palm Project which includes a nucleus
estate and smallholder component is a good example of this.
1.08      Constraints.  There are several constraints on development of the
sector:
(i) There is a shortage of qualified middle and higher
level technicians, such as extension officers and crop
specialists, without which no project can be success-
fully implemented.
(ii)  Technological levels of subsistence farmers are low;
and farmers' organizations, particularly the cooperative
movement, are weak.
(iii) The Ministry of Agriculture (MA) is weak in areas of
sectoral planning, project preparation, and monitoring
and evaluation of ongoing projects.
(iv) There is a lack of infrastructure and support services and
there are distribution and marketing deficiencies. Feeder
roads, storage centers and buying points are inadequate.
D.  Bank's Role In Agriculture and Rural Development
1.09      Current.  The Bank supports Liberia's balanced approach except
for large-scale mechanized rice production; since it is considered that
rice as well as most other crops can be produced more efficiently by small-
holders under integrated agricultural schemes, emnhasis -in Bank support



- 4 -
is on financing smallholder rural development. However, tree crop and
forestry projects involving both large-scale enterprises and small farm
participation are also receiving attention. The ongoing Bank group-financed
projects are generally successful. The first, Cr. 306-LBR, an Agricultural
Development and Technical Assistance project, suffered during its eary
stages because of financial, administrative and managerial problems. But the
situation gradually improved and all project objectives except for the Pilot
Rubber Scheme were achieved. Preinvestment studies carried out under the
project led to three projects. The Lofa Agricultural Development Project,
Cr. 577-LBR of August 1, 1975, is progressing satisfactorily with good
expatriate and Liberian management staff. Appraisal targets for swamp rice
and coffee should be reached; however there is likely to be a shortfall in
cocoa  utput. Farmer response is good.  The Bong Agricultural Development
Project, Cr. 700-LBR of December 29, 1977, is also being implemented satis-
factorily. This is an integrated project similar to the Lofa Project. The
Rubber Project, Cr. 786/Ln. 1544-LBR of April 21, 1978, aims at strengthening
the Liberian-owned rubber industry. Project start-up activities such as
staffing, land acquisition for nurseries and building sites, preparation of
building plans, etc. have started but it is highly unlikely that the 833 ha
pw:go>b? planting target for 1979 could be reached because of insufficinplanting
material and staffing difficulties. This project at full development would
contribute substantially to Liberia's export earnings.  A forestry project,
Cr. 839-LBR, which became effective on July 28, 1978, aims to strengthen
forestry institutions and produce lumber mainly for exports. The need to
develop local expertise is recognized in all Bank-financed projects and
training programs have been included in them for both project staff and
farmers.
1.10      Future.  Support will continue to be given to a balanced approach
to agricultural development in Liberia with emphasis on rural development
(RD). One RD project is being prepared by Liberia with guidance from the
Bank. Although discussions on its composition are still taking place, it is
likely to include components aimed at strengthening institutions for administer-
ing agricultural development at the county level as well as productive and social
infrastructure investments. Follow-up rubber and forestry projects are planned
and assistance would continue to be given to coffee and cocoa development. These
would contribute substantially to foreign exchange earnings. The Bank will
also continue to assist in developing local expertise; a Bank mission in
February 1979 examined manpower problems in Liberia and identified training
needs for the agricultural sector. The report will form the basis for develop-
ing a comprehensive manpower development program. A recently signed feeder
road project (Ln. 2236a-LBR) will improve the road network of the Western and
Central Counties of Liberia and provide infrastructure support for existing
and future projects.
E. Agricultural Institutions
1.11      Ministry of Agriculture (MA) is responsible for planning and
implementing agricultural programs. While its budgetary allocations more
than tripled between 1973 and 1976, its impact has been limited because of
inadequately qualified and experienced technical staff. Its
budget is spent mainly on salaries and wages. Minimal logistic support is



- 5 -
provided for field staff. MA is fully aware of the need to streamline its
activities and is in the process of decentralizing its operations by strength-
ening all its county offices. Under Cr. 306-LBR, the Bank provided technical
assistance to GOL for strengthening its headquarters operations. Further
assistance would be provided to strengthen institutions at the county level
under the RD projects mentioned in para 1.10.
1.12      The Agricultural Mechanization Co. (AGRIMECO).  This is a wholly
owned Government corporation, established in 1972 to implement large-scale
land clearing and farm mechanization schemes. It is operated as a commercial
company empowered to provide machinery services to anyone. Since inception
AGRIMECO has been clearing land mainly for MA-sponsored projects. AGRIMECO
was not considered suitable for smallholder development in the Bank-financed
Lofa and Bong Projects (Cr. 577-LBR and Cr. 700-LBR) on technological, finan-
cial and economic grounds. It was ruled out under the present project for the
same reasons. Its price quotations for land clearing are US$1,600 per hectare,
which is more than double the estimated costs if the project does the land
clearing itself (para 3.06). AGRIMECO's overhead costs and profit margins
account for most of the cost differential.
1.13      Other Institutions.  Other institutions which would be directly
involved in project implementation include the Ministries of Lands and Mines
(MLM), Public Works (MPW), Local Government (MLG) and the National Ports
Authority (NPA). MLM is responsible for surveying and deeding all Government
lands. MFW would be responsible for constructing, rehabilitating, and resur-
facing some roads in the project area (para 3.15) and together with'MLG for
maintenance of public roads in the project area. NPA is responsible for
operation of all ports in Liberia. It would provide space for the proposed
oil palm company for its operations at Harper. These four institutions have
common problems: insufficient technical staff, inadequate management and lack
of vehicular support. MLM, in particular, lacks staff capable of carrying out
surveys for obtaining land titles; they would have to be supported by survey
teams hired from the private sector.
F. The Oil Palm Sub-Sector
1.14      Production.  Liberia has approximately 10,000 ha of cultivated
plantations, about 50% of which is in full production. There are about
35,000 ha of wild groves, which are harvested by small farmers for home
consumption and village markets. About 80% of the cultivated area is in the
hands of large farmers and corporations ranging in size from 65 ha to 3,000
ha. The remaining 20% is operated by small farmers with GOL's technical
and financial assistance.  Present palm oil production is estimated to be           (
around 10,000 tons. Average yields are relatively low: cultivated plantations
produce about 1.75 tons of palm oil and 0.25 tons of palm kernel oil per
hectare per year while yield from wild groves is only about 15% of this.
1.15      The oil palm industry is still in its early stages of development.
The largest and oldest plantations are the 3,000 ha LIBINC plantation in Bassa
County (established in 1965), and the 2,000 ha West Africa Oil Palm Corporation
(WAC), plantation in Cape Mount County. Both are privately owned. GOL's



-6
involvement in the sector did not begin until 1972 when it began to provide
technical and financial assistance to farmers through the Liberian Produce
Marketing Corporation (LPMC, para 1.18). There are three smallholder farming
projects being operated by LPMCo These are the 900 ha project at Foya-Solumba,
a 300 ha project in Zlehtown and a 270 ha project in Kpatwee. These projects
have been in operation since 1974 and are being financed wholly by GOL.
1.16      Government's first attempt to develop a large-scale industrial
estate with associated smallholders followed the signing of an agricultural
cooperation agreement between the Presidents of the Ivory Coast and Liberia.
Ivory Coast agreed to assist Liberia in developing its oil palm and coconut
industry. As part of the assistance, the proposed oil palm project at
Decoris was prepared together with two other projects at Buto in Sinoe
County, and Dube in Grand Gedeh County, by the Ivorian Corporation, Socigt6
pour le Diveloppement et l'Exploitation du Palmier I Huile (SODEPALM) in
1976. GOL would like to develop a 5,200 ha complex at Buto (3,100 ha of
nucleus estate and 2,100 ha of smallholder); a 5,200 ha project at Dube (4,166
ha of nucleus estate and 1,034 ha of smallholder) and the Decoris project.
The Buto project is being financed by the European Economic Community (EEC)
and the Dube project by the Liberian Bank for Development and Investment
(LBDI). Under an agreement signed in March 1977 SODEPALM was assigned a
contract to manage the Buto and Dube projects for the Liberia Palm Products
Corporation (LPPC) (para 1.19).  In 1977, 510 ha were planted at Buto and in
1978, 940 ha. Plans are to plant 1,650 ha in 1979,, but this may prove over-
ambitious as only about 300 ha were cleared and windrowed at the time of
appraisal in January/February 1979. At Dube about 615 ha have been developed.
If developed as planned, these three projects at full maturity, around 1993,
would produce about 50,000 - 60,000 tons of palm oil annually. This would be
less than 1% of world production and about 1% of the amount sold on the entire
world expiort market.
1.17      Processing.  Processing capacity is limited and inefficient.  Mills
are of the Vandekerckhove Rural Extraction Unit types, with capacities in the
range of 1-10 tons of fresh fruit bunches (ffb) per hour. LPMC has been
operating a 1 ton ffb/hour mill at Totota since the middle of 1975. It plans
to open one of similar size and make at Foya in mid-1979. There are also
three private plants: LIBINC: with a capacity of 10 tons ffb/hour, WAC: 5
tons ffb/hour and another with capacity of 1 ton ffb/hour. The oil extraction
rates of these mills average about 15% which is quite low compared to 22-23%
for well run modern mills. LPMC also has a palm kernel oil mill at the
Freeport Zone of Monrovia, in operation since 1972. It has a processing
capacity of 18,000 tons of palm kernel annually but currently uses less than
half of this.
1.18      Institutions:  Liberian Produce Marketing Corporation (LPMC).  This
company is involved in marketing tree crop products other than rubber.
However, there are privately owned companies in the oil palm sub-sector such
as LIBINC and WAC (para 1.15) which produce and market their own products.
LPMC was established in 1962 by GOL in partnership with the Danish East
Asiatic Company (EAC). In December 1975, GOL acquired EAC's 50% shareholding,
but retained EAC as managers until December 31, 1977. The only remaining
expatriate staff is the General Manager. LPMC has autonomous status within
MA. In 1971 LPMC was given overall responsibility by GOL for its tree crops program.



-7-
In 1972 it began operation of a palm kernel processing mill (para 1.17).
In_1977 GOL established the Liberia Palm Products Corporation as a subsidiary
of LPMC for the purpose of carrying out the Buto project (para 1.19). LPMC
has responsibility for GOL tree crops program, but has suffered from a
shortage of qualified technical staff to carry out the program since its
inception. Even now there are no Liberians among LPMC's senior tree crop
staff with adequate technical qualifications and experience to execute any
sizable project.
1.19      Liberia Palm Products Corporation (LPPC).  LPPC was established in.(
Januar_ 1v977 as part of the external financing agreement between GOL and EEC j
for the Buto project. Its Board of Directors consists of representatives of
the Ministries of Finance, Agriculture, Commerce, Planning, Local Government,
the General Manager of LPMC and LPPC's Managing Director. Its share capital
is US$0.8 million. Although supposedly financially autonomous, its operating
expenses are met by the Ministry of Finance (MFN) as if it were a Government
department.  LPPC currently suffers from inadequate management, lack of
adequate financial and accounting controls and lack of experienced technical
staff.
1.20      Future Policy.  GOL intends to continue developing industrial oil
palm estates with associated smallholders and continue providing technical and
financial assistance through LPMC to small and medium sized producers in areas
where soils and climate favor oil palm production. GOL also intends to
rationalize the institutions for administering the subsector.

II. THE PROJECT AREA
2.01      Location.  The project is located in Maryland County.  It falls
within an area bounded on the North by latitude 4 045'N; South, by latitude
4029'N; East, by longitude 7 4'W;and West, by longitude 8 0O'W.  The distance
by road from Monrovia is 760 km and from Harper 32 km (IBRD Map No.
14275).
2.02      Climate.  Climatically the area is very favorable for oil palm
cultivation. There is a very short dry season in January and two months of
heavy rains in May and June.  The monthly mean average is 200 mm.  Average
annual rainfall has been 2,200 mm during the last 15 years (1964-1978) and
average annual water deficit is estimated at 60 mm which is one of the lowest
encountered in the oil palm belt in West Africa and in other oil palm growing
areas. Annual sunshine recorded at Tabou in the Ivory Coast, 45 km east of
the project area, is estimated at 1,954 hours which is more than sufficient
for palm production.  Mean monthly temperatures vary between 24 C and 27 C;
the minimum never falls below 22 C.
2.03      Vegetation.  The area has been inhabited and farmed for a long
time. The vegetative pattern is a mosaic consisting of patches of light
forests (33% of the total area) with a high density of small and medium size
trees (approximately 365/ha), regrowth of various ages (45%), annual crops
(5%), perennial crops (5%) and swamps (12%). There are no large areas of
noxious weeds such as Imperata cylindrica or Eupatorium odoratum.
2.04      Topography/Hydrology.  The project is situated on the old Africa
Precambrian shield. The terrain is generally undulating with most of the
slopes having gradients below 10%. Steep slopes occur on areas adjacent to
rivers. The project's hinterland is drained by an extensive and closely
spaced network of rivers, streams and creeks running perpendicular to the
coast. Their widths vary between 3 - 5 m for the smallest creeks to 20 - 30
m for main rivers (IBRD Map No. 14275). The proposed nucleus estate is bounded
by two major drainage systems, the Deyea Creek on the West and the Decoris
River on the East. Three river/creek systems flow north to south through the
proposed estate: the Jivroke Creek to the East, the Bolulu Creek in the
center and the Gbwenewe Creek to the West.
2.05      Soils.  Detailed soil surveys have been carried out for 8,300 ha.
Soils are generally fertile throughout the area. They range in texture from
sandy loams to light clays. There are four classes of soils distributed as
follows:  Class I - 30%; Class II - 22%; Class III - 11% and Class IV - 37%.
Details of these classes are found in Working Paper Cl of the Project Files.
2.06      Population.  Total population within a 20 km radius of the nucleus
estate has been estimated at 46,000 and within a 30 km radius 56,000. There
are two major towns at Harper (6,000) and Plibo (5,000). There are several



villages: Bewahn (730), Blebo (730), Newake (400) and Wloween (200). The
population on the 8,300 ha surveyed to date is estimated at about 1,200-1,600
(density of 22/sq km) or 250-300 farm families. Labor for oil palm development
would therefore be adequately available. The social organization in the area
is based on tribal authority. There is a paramount chief responsible for
several clans. A clan comprises several villages under the authority of clan
chiefs and town chiefs. Each village is divided into "quarters" (usually
large traditional families) directed by "headmen".
2.07      Farming Systems.  Farming systems are based on shifting cultivation.
Farmers clear forests and areas ready to come out of fallow during the dry
season. Rice is planted at the beginning of the rainy season. After the
rice is harvested, cassava is planted for about 1 or 2 years.  The land then
reverts to fallow for about 7-10 years. Rice and cassava are planted mainly
for home consumption; but any extra production is sold in Plibo and Harper.
Each household comprises about 6 persons and farms about 1-1.5 ha each year.
Perennial crops are limited to smallholder rubber plantations, many of which
are of poor quality (with low yields less than 315 kg per hectare). There
are also some sugar cane patches and fruit trees near villages. There are
numerous wild old palm groves which are harvested and processed using tradi-
tional methods. Palm oil is used mainly for home consumption; but part is
sold in bottles in Harper and Plibo. There are no commercial oil palm
plantations in the area.
2.08      Land Tenure.  All lands are considered public and owned by the
State.  The President is the only person authorized to provide titles.  There
are two systems of tenure: private property where occupants have freehold
title to land, and tribal property which smallholders farm on the basis of
tribal certificate. Tribal certificates are obtained from the Paramount or
Clan Chiefs. Part of all tribal properties are earmarked "tribal reserves"
and certificates cannot be given for these. The procedure for obtaining
title to a piece of land under the tribal system is as follows. The farmer
applies to the tribal chief for a tribal certificate. For this the chief is
-  usually handed a gift which can be in cash or kind.  The chief provides the
farmer with a tribal certificate which he then takes to the Land Commissioner
in the area. The Land Commissioner makes sure that the parcel in question
is not part of the "tribal reserves" and that the land does not belong to
anybody else.  He certifies this.  The farmer takes the tribal certificate to
MFN where he pays US$1.50 per hectare for the area stated on his certificate.
He then gets the parcel surveyed either by a private or Government surveyor.
The applicant takes the map of the land he is applying for and the receipt
from MFN to the President's office with his request for land. The President
reviews the application and makes his decision.          *
2.09      Roads.  Roads in the project area are poorly developed.  The existing
road network is shown in IBRD Map No. 14275.  The only road with direct access
to the proposed estate and smallholder plantations is the Plibo-Blebo road
which crosses the Northern section of the estate site, and connects villages
including Wloween, Bewahn, Doughbo, Newake and Blebo. The Plibo-Harper road
provides a link with the national road network.

III. THE PROJECT
A. General Description
3.01      The project was identified by GOL and prepared by the Ivorian
Corporation SODEPALM (para 1.16). Its main objectives are to generate
export earnings and provide employment and incomes for rural farm families
through the establishment of 7,500 ha of high yielding oil palm on a nucleus
estate and associated smallholdings. In achieving these it would help
diversify, widen and strengthen the base of the Liberian economy. At full
development it would produce about 24,000 tons of palm oil and 4,300 tons of
palm kernel; employ about 1,000 people permanently and include about 1,000
smallholder families.
3.02      The project would be carried out by the specially established
Decoris Oil Palm Company (DOPC) and would be implemented over a 7 year
period (1980-1987). It would comprise:
(a) establishing and operating a 5,000 ha nucleus estate
using mechanical and hand clearing methods:
(b) providing technical services and credit facilities to
develop 2,500 ha of plantation area for smallholders with
individual oil palm holdings averaging 2.5 ha in size;
(c)  training staff and smallholders both on-the-job and
abroad;
(d) constructing an oil mill with a processing capacity
of 30 tons of fresh fruit bunches (ffb) per hour;
(e) establishing a fruit collection system (to serve the
nucleus estate and smallholder plantations);
(f) operating a grant/credit scheme for participating
smallholders;
(g) constructing within the nucleus estate and smallholder
block plantations about 27 km of main access roads, 93 km
of feeder roads and 350 km of collector tracks including
supporting culverts and bridges; 1/
(h) rehabilitating and resurfacing about 14 km of main access
roads and construction of 35 km of feeder roads linking
the nucleus estate to smallholder plantations with support-
ing culverts and bridges;
1/   Main access or grade 1 roads would be all weather laterite roads with an
average daily traffic of 40 plus, a cleared width of 12 m, a width
between palm trees of 22 m and a surface thickness of 15 cm. Feeder or
grade 2 roads would also be laterite but with average daily traffic of 20
plus, cleared width of 12 m, a width between palm trees of 15 m and a
surface thickness of 10 cm. Collector tracks would be simple dirt tracks
with no filling.



- 11 -
(i) constructing and installing of storage and port facili-
ties at Harper to facilitate loading to mainline vessels
and shipping directly from that port;
(j) providing technical assistance to strengthen the monitoring
and evaluation division of MA and consultant services to
carry out a review of the oil palm industry in Liberia, oil
mill design, and preparation of tender documents, soil surveys
and mapping, design and supervision of port improvements and
the design and supervision of oil barge construction.
B. Detailed Features
3.03      Statutory Corporation.  The project would be implemented by a
statutory corporation, the Decoris Oil Palm Company Ltd. (DOPC), which would
have the structure of a commercial entity in accordance with the Liberian
Business Corporation Act. It would come under the Ministry of Agriculture.
To ensure efficient management DOPC would enter into a corporate management
agreement with an internationally recognized firm experienced in oil palm
estate management (para 4.02). DOPC would require about 40 man years of
management and consulting time over the first 5 year investment period costing
about US$1.6 million. Senior staff would be provided with houses (8) costing
about US$50,000 each, four cars (US$7,000 each) and four 4-wheel drive vehicles
(US$9,000 each). About 10,000 square feet of office space, workshops and
warehouses would be constructed at a cost of about US$225,000. The cost
tables in Project File Working Paper C6 provide details of staffing, housing,
buildings and equipment.
3.04      Planting Program.  Phasing of the project planting program would be
as follows:
Project Year                1-/   2        3      4      5       Total
-      hectares-------
Nucleus Estate              0     800   1,400  1,400  1,400    5,000
Smallholders                0     400     700    700    700    2,500
Total:                      0   1,200       2,100         2100    7,_500
No. of Smallholders:        0     160      280    280    280    1,000
Plantings would be completed in 5 years and all plantings would be in pro-
duction within 9 years.  A continuous supply of fruit is required for the
mill to achieve a high level of efficiency. With a nucleus plantation, the
1/   Establishing nursery and clearing for subsequent planting.



- 12 -
risk of large variations in supply arising from fluctuations in the output
from smallholdings would be considerably reduced. In addition a well run
plantation mill with an efficient fruit collection and marketing system would
be in a position to offer smallholders competitive prices and a regular outlet
for their fruit. Because of the suitability of the soils and climate for oil
palm growing in the Decoris area, GOL intends to continue the planting program
in a follow-up phase in which development of smallholdings would comprise the
major effort.
3.05      Nucleus Estate Development.  To ensure that the planting program
proceeds as scheduled, about 8,350 ha (44% of which would be under plantations)
for which detailed soil surveys have already been done would be acquired by
GOL and leased to DOPC for a period of not less than 50 years as a condition
of effectivness. An assurance was obtained at negotiations that GOL
would acquire and transfer to DOPC for a period of not less than 50 years all
additional land required to establish 5,000 ha of plantations no later than
September 1980. Settlers already cultivating any of the land acquired by GOL
for transfer to DOPC would be compensated by GOL adequately. An assurance
was obtained at negotiations that the criteria for determing compensation should
be agreed between the Bank and the Borrower and shall inter alia include cash
payments for structure and value of crops, land of comparable size and quality,
as well as community facilities in the areas of resettlement.
3.06      DOPC would clear the nucleus estate mechanically using its own
machinery. Costs are estimated at about US$614 per hectare compared to
AGRIMECO's quote of US$1,600 per hectare.  Provisions have been made for 5
crawler tractors and associated equipment costing about US$1.2 million and 22
chain saws costing about US$20,000.  Crawler tractors equipped with KG blades
would be used for felling trees in planting areas; the tree would then be
cut into sections using chain saws and burnt. Tree pushing equipment would be
used only in areas earmarked for roads, boundaries and building sites. There
would be no windrowing as about 3 m wide planting rows would be opened using
specially designed V blades.
3.07      The project's seed requirements would be met from the Institut de
Recherches pour les Huiles et 0leagineux (IRHO) seed gardens in the Ivory
Coast and other suitable suppliers. Germinated seedlings would be flown in a
week prior to being planted in prenurseries. The planting material to be used
has been tested and proven under conditions in the Ivory Coast similar to those
in the Decoris area, and have already proven successful elsewhere in Liberia.
Assurances were obtained at negotiations that DOPC would make necessary arrange-
ments with IRHO and/or other suitable suppliers for the supply of all project
seed requirements.
3.08      Smallholders.  Smallholder plantations would be developed in blocks,
300-400 ha in size, located in 7 main villages adjacent to the motorable road
leading to the nucleus estate.  The villages would include Bewahn, Blebo,
Newake, Wloween, Dougbo, Tuogbo and Wilsonville (IBRD Map No.' 14275). The program
would be the responsibility of DOPC's Smallholders Plantation Division (para
4.02). Participants would be selected by DOPC's staff in accordance with
selection criteria specified in para 3.09. Credit would be provided in
(a) kind: including seedlings, cover crop seeds, wirenetting, fertilizers,
agrocides and other non-labor inputs valued at US$455 per hectare and (b)
cash: US$1.00 per day worked or a total of US$150 per hectare. DOPC would
also provide as a grant technical assistance during land preparation for
surveying, pegging and logging valued at US$73 per hectare and extension



- 13 -
services. DOPC would be responsible for fruit collection and smallholders
would enter into a loan agreement with DOPC which would include a commitment
to sell all ffb to DOPC's mill from plantations established with DOPC's
assistance; loans would be paid from the proceeds of the sales.
3.09      In keeping with GOL's objectives of assisting the rural poor,
assurances were obtained at negotiations that DOPC, in selecting smallholder
participants, would give preference to people who:  (i) are residents of
the village where the plantation is located; (ii) are engaged in agriculture
as their main source of livelihood; (iii) have labor available to establish,
maintain and harvest 2.5 ha of oil palm; and (iv) are willing to enter a
formal agreement with DOPC stating their willingness to (a) follow DOPC's
recommendations on cultivation, maintenance and harvesting techniques; (b)
repay their loan plus interest at 12.5% per annum over a 7 year period
following 6 years of grace for principal during which interest would be
capitalized; (c) offer DOPC land as collateral; and (d) agree to sell all
fresh fruit bunches to DOPC. As an incentive to participate in the project
it is necessary to provide farmers as a grant 1 bag (60 kilos) of rice per
month valued at US$25 per bag for four years, during which their plantations
mature, as well as sufficient land for cultivating food crops (para 3.10).
DOPC would also aid them in establishing food gardens, selling them fertilizers,
agrocides and tools and providing extension service.
3.10      Lands currently owned by Government adjacent to villages would be
used for smallholder block plantations. To obtain the 2,500 ha required
during this phase of the program it would be necessary to carry out soil
surveys on about 5,500 ha (assuming about 45% would be suitable for planting),
select the best of this, and have it demarcated for smallholder plantations.
There should be no difficulty in finding this amount of land since there is
about 9,000 ha of potentially suitable areas. (IBRD Map No. 14275) At
negotiations an assurance was obtained from GOL that this would be completed by
December 31, 1980. In demarcated areas participating farmers would initially
obtain tribal certificates for their holdings but would subsequently with
DOPC technical assistance obtain title. Each farm would be allowed to plant
food crops on an extra 2 ha outside the block plantations. Settlers already
cultivating lands where smallholder plantations are to be located would be
compensated on terms satisfactory to the Bank. The relevant assurance stated
in para 3.05 applies to these settlers as well.
3.11      Training.  Under their contract agreement, DOPC management consult-
ants would be required to implement a program for training Liberians and
providing them with opportunities for on-the-job experience that would enable
them to fill senior managerial and technical posts at an early stage. DOPC
would be required by Project Year 2 to select candidates for the mill engineer
and mill manager positions since their training would require at least 4 years
of university training plus 2 years practical work before joining the company.
Part of their training would involve visits to companies where the mill
equipment is being manufactured including working with engineers in the
construction phase. Further practical experience in actually running a mill
would be obtained by working with the expatriate mill engineer and mill
manager. Liberians who are already trained in agriculture and engineering
would be given on-the-job training and short courses abroad including short
working periods in oil palm plantations of other developing countries. These
would be initially hired as field superintendents; from among them the estate



- 14 -
manager, assistant estate manager, smallholder manager and roads engineer would
be selected. Persons selected by DOPC to undergo training for senior managerial
and technical positions would be required to provide an undertaking that they
would work with DOPC for a minimum period of two years after completion of this
training. At negotiations an assurance was obtained to this effect. Overseers,
headmen, laborers (for harvesting) and farmers would receive on-the-job training.
3.12      The Central Mill.  Production would begin in 1986 with about 14,000
tons ffb building up to an annual production of about 109,000 tons by 1993. To
process this, a palm oil mill capable of processing 30 tons ffb per hour would
be constructed. Its cost is estimated at US$13.1 million. The mill would be
a single production line type to be built in two stages. In the first stage,
to be completed by 1986, all civil works and installation of plant and equipment
capable of processing 20 tons ffb per hour would be completed. This would cost
about US$11 million (exclusive of contingencies).  While equipment for the 20
ton ffb mill is being tested, equipment to process an additional 10 tons ffb per
hour (costing about US$2 million) would be installed. The total mill would be
in operation by end 1987, i.e. at project completion. The contract for the mill
would be on a turn-key basis with all equipment ordered by 1984. A maintenance
workshop equipped with tools and equipment required to keep the mill functioning
at all times would be constructed on the mill site. At negotiations assurances
were obtained that DOPC would employ consultants to prepare preliminary designs
of the palm oil mill, prepare tender documents, supervise mill construction and
implementation of the works. The consultants and the terms and conditions of
their contract would be acceptable to the Bank.
3.13      Estate-and Smallholder Fruit Collection System.  Both estate and
smallholders ffb would be collected from roadside collection points by dump
trucks (capacity: 6 tons ffb) provided under the project. Those collecting
smallholder ffb would be equipped with scales. Each truck would make an
average of three trips a day. Ffb would be graded by project staff,, weighed
and loaded manually. There would be discounts for overripe or badly bruised
fruits. The truck driver would be responsible for weighing and grading the
fruit. Receipts would be made in triplicate. One would go to the smallholder
and the others to DOPC's smallholder plantation and processing and marketing
divisions. Trucks would be weighed at the mill gate (in and out) and the
weight of each truckload recorded. The weight of bunches delivered daily by
each block plantation would be communicated the next day to the overseer of
the particular block plantation where fruits were collected the previous day.
The aggregate of the truck driver's records of individual sales should tally
with millgate delivery weights. Farmers would be paid in cash at the end of
each week. The price to be paid would be established annually according to
procedures stated in para 6.04.
3.14.     Road Program. 1/  To ensure efficient transportation of ffb, palm
oil and kernel and distribution of inputs, the project would include a program
for constructing and improving main access and feeder roads and collector
tracks including 15 km North-South access roads on the nucleus estate costing
1/   Details of the road program are found in Working Paper C3 of the Project
File. All costs are based on contractors quotations at time of appraisal.



- 15 -
about US$26,000 per km; 12 km East-West access roads costing about US$29,000
per km; 5.8 km access road linking the southern boundary of the nucleus estate
to the existing Fishtown-Harper road at a cost of about US$26,000 per km;
rehabilitation of 9 km of the Fishtown-Harper road costing about US$10,000
per km; resurfacing about 5 km of Plibo-Harper road leading to the port of Harper
at a cost of about US$10,000 per km. The program would also include: construc-
tion of about 43 km of feeder roads on nucleus estate, 50 km of feeder roads
on the smallholder plantation, and 35 km of feeder roads linking smallholder
plantations to the estate. All feeder roads are estimated to cost about
US$16,000 per km. About 350 km of tracks would be graded. The dissected nature
of the terrain would also necessitate construction of culverts and bridges. These
would probably include bridges as follows: 100' for the Bolulu Creek costing
US$150,000; 50' for the Gbwenewe Creek costing US$75,000; 100' for the Decoris
River costing approximately US$150,000; 100' for the Deyea Creek costing approxi-
mately US$225,000; and 50' for the Wachuka Creek costing US$75,000. Assurances
were obtained at negotiations that DOPC would employ consultants to prepare
final designs for roads and bridges and prepare tender documents. The con-
sultants' terms of reference and conditions of employment would be acceptable
to the Bank. All estate roads and feeder roads on smallholder plantations
would be maintained by DOPC; however, assurances were obtained at negotiations
that GOL would maintain all other roads constructed under the project.
3.15      Some roads in para 3.14 would be used more than 75% of the time by
non-project users.  The roads are the 9 km of the Fishtown-Harper road to be
rehabilitated (costing TJS$80,000), the 5 km of Plibo-Harper road to be resurfaced
(costing US$45,000), the 35 km of feeder roads linking smallholder plantations
to the estate (costing US$568,000). The latter would include a bridge across
the Deyea Creek costing an additional US$225,000. Their total costs inclusive
of the contingencies at levels shown in para 3.19 would be US$1.3 million.
During negotiations assurances were obtained from GOL that these roads would
be constructed by GOL by December 31, 1981.
3.16      Port Improvements. 1/  DOPC would be responsible for shipping its
own palm oil and palm kernel. It would have facilities which would be con-
structed at Harper to store palm oil and onload it to mainline vessels. They
would include: a barge fitted with pumps, an oil palm storage depot consisting
of two storage tanks, each capable of storing 1,000 tons of palm oil; a
pumping/ boiler room with associated equipment and piping; and
a weigh bridge capable of handling trucks of 20 tons capacity. Further, a
mooring facility would be constructed at 7 m facing the eastern side of the
existing National Ports Authority (NPA) pier. This would comprise two mooring
dolphins located 15 m on either side of a loading dolphin. The pier and the
barge would be connected with oil resistant flexible hoses.  The project would
purchase a 500 ton barge which would be fitted with two diesel engine palm oil
pumps each having a capacity of 125 tons per hour at a head of 15 m water
column. Pumps would be of the screw type with cast iron housing and steel
screws. Estimated cost of the barge is US$600,000 while that of the total port
1/   Details are found in Working Paper C4 of the Project File.



- 16 -
improvements exclusive of contingencies is US$1.3 million. l/ DOPC would
require about 195 m2 of space for its facilities. NPA has agreed to rent
DOPC space at Harper to install its facilities and pass its water and
electricity lines.
3.17      Consultant Services, Studies and Surveys.  The project provides for
90 man months of consultant services estimated to cost about US$10,000 2/ per
month and 3 man years of technical assistance (US$50,000 per man year) 3/ to
assist MA in strengthening its Monitoring and Evaluation Division. Consultants
would:
(a) prepare preliminary designs of the palm oil mill, prepare
tender documents, analyze tenders and supervise mill
construction (50 man months, starting 1983);
(b) design and supervise construction of port facilities at
Harper (5 man months, beginning 1985);
(c)  design and supervise in conjunction with the project's
road engineer access and feeder roads financed under the
project (12 man months, beginning March 1980);
(d) review the oil palm industry in Liberia to see how best
the institutions in the sub-sector can be rationalised
and made more efficient (para 1.20), (14 man months,
beginning early 1981);
(e) prepare a follow-up oil palm project (6 man months,
beginning early 1984);
(f) develop and advise PPC on a pricing formula for small-
holder ffb (2 man months, beginning 1984).
1/   This is made up as follows:
Civil works:                       $130,000
Equipment:                           240,000
500 ton Barge:                      600,000
Barge Mooring and
Working Dolphins:                 130,000
Insurance and Freight

Loading costs,
mounting and commissioning
of facilities:                    150,000
Consultancy, Design and
Supervision                        48,000
2/   This includes fees for 25 working days at US$250 per day; accommodation
and meals of US$75 per day; air fares, internal transportation and
incidentals totalling US$1,500 per month.
3/   This excludes the cost of housing and transportation.

At negotiations assurances were obtained that consultants would be hired
under terms and conditions satisfactory to the Bank.
C. Cost Estimates
3.18      Total project cost over the 7-year development period 1980/81 to
1986/87 is estimated at US$48.8 million.  Of this US$26.7 million or ' iould
be foreign costs.  Costs are detailed in Annex 1 and summarized in Table 1.

Project costs include an estimated US$0.9 million of identifiable taxes on
fuel, diesel oil and lubricants and other locally purchased consumables but
exclude all other taxes and duties on items specifically imported for the
project. The latter reflects GOL present policy to exempt from duties and
taxes all goods imported for project use. This was confirmed during
negotiations. Base cost estimates use prices and quotations obtained during
appraisal, but have been adjusted to reflect costs that are expected to
prevail by end of 1979.
3.19      Costs include:  (a) physical contingencies equal to 15% of base
costs for all civil works; 7%, for vehicles and equipment and 5%, for all
other items except salaries; (b) price contingency of 10% compounded annually
for all local costs; and (c) price contingencies for foreign costs in accord-
ance with the Bank's general guidelines calculated on base costs plus physical
contingencies compounded annually:
1980-85        1986-90
Vehicle, equipment and farm inputs:            6              5
Civil works, construction material             7
and consultants:                                            6
Salaries and other operating costs:            7              7
Total contingencies calculated on the foregoing basis are equivalent to 31%
(US$15.4 million) of total costs or 46% of base line costs.
D. Proposed Financing Plan
3.20      The proposed financing plan is summarized in Table 2, and shown in
detail in Annex 2.

1/  Refers to financing of consultancy costs for items in d, e and f of para
3.17 and provision of technical assistance; financing of consultancy
for mill, port and roads included in costs of these items above.
The IBRD loan would be at the current lending rate at the time of loan approval
and would be for a period of 20 years with a 5-year grace period. The CDC loan
would be for a period of 20 years including a 7-year grace period at 7.5% per
annum. ADB loan would be for 20 years including 5-year grace period at an
interest rate of 8% including the statutory commission. Conditions of the
EEC loan are similar to those of IDA. Details of the type of financing
are shown in Annex 2. CDC's loan would be joint financing while those of
the EEC and ADB would be parallel financing. In addition to its US$25.3
million equity investment, GOL would arrange further finances for DOPC to
the tune of about US$3.0 million required between years 6 to 9 to bring
all plantings to maturity and the mill into operation. Assurance to this
effect was obtained during negotiations.



- 20 
3.21      The Bank and other cofinancers' loans to GOL would be passed on to
DOPC as equity and loans. DOPC's debt/equity ratio would be about 1:1.09. The
total equity investment would be about US$25.3 million. Of this, about US$13.5
million would come from IBRD, CDC, ADB and EEC loans, and the rest from local resources
(para 6.06). Conclusion of a subsidiary financing agreement between GOL and
DOPC for channelling GOL and Bank funds on terms and conditions satisfactory
to the Bank would be a condition of effectiveness. Interest rates would be
equal to at least the going commercial rate for long-term loans which is at
present 10%; CDC, ADB and IBRD loans would be relent for 25 years with a repayment
period of 17 years and a grace period of 8 years during which interest would be
capitalized. DOPC would provide credit to farmers (para 3.08) in cash and kind.
During negotiations, assurances were obtained that loans to smallholders would
be at an interest rate (also positive) of at least 12.5% for 13 years including
a 6-year grace period for principal and interest but during which period interest
would be capitalized. At negotiations assurances were obtained from Government
that its relending interest rate to DOPC and DOPC's onlending interest rate to
smallholders would be reviewed annually in consultation with the Bank with a
view to maintaining an adequate rate of interest.
3.22      To expedite project implementation and avoid unnecessary slippage
GOL agreed to undertake a number of start-up activities during 1979 and
the first half of calendar year 1980. These include establishment of DOPC,
selection of a management agency, preparation of a draft management agreement,
acquisition and leasing to DOPC lands for the nucleus estate (para 3.05),
ordering planting material, and initiating registration and selection of
smallholders. The total cost of start-up activities (which are included in
project costs), estimated at US$0.9 million, would be reimbursed to GOL out
of CDC's loan.
E. Procurement
3.23      All Bank-financed and CDC contracts for US$100,000 or more for
purchasing farm inputs such as fertilizer, wirenetting, chemicals, etc.
(US$1.6 million); heavy equipment and vehicles (US$1.4 million); barge and
port facilities at Harper (US$1.3 million); consultants (US$0.9 million),
valued in aggregate at US$5.2 million would be procured through ICB in
accordance with Bank guidelines. Contracts for these same items between
US$20,000 to US$100,000 (up to US$1.5 million) would be procured under local
competitive bidding (LCB) procedures acceptable to the Bank, and contracts
of less than US$20,000 (up to US$800,000) by direct competitive shopping.
Domestically manufactured goods would be allowed a 15% preference or the
applicable import duty whichever is lower. Since the oil mill would be the
first of its kind in Liberia, it would be built under a turn-key contract.
The latter, valued at US$17.1 million (of which US$4.9 million would be
financed by the Bank), would be awarded under limited international tendering



- 21 -
procedures acceptable to the Bank, after prequalifications of potential suppliers.
Services of expatriate staff valued at US$1.4 million would be obtained in
accordance with procedures acceptable to the Bank. Contracts for civil works
(other than buildings to house the palm oil mill which would be procured under
the turn-key contract) comprising mainly offices, senior and junior staff
housing, laborers housing and camps, warehouses and workshops valued at US$2.9
million, and construction, rehabilitation and resurfacing of roads, valued at
US$2.3 million,would be financed by ADB, EEC and GOL in accordance with
their own procedures; however the design standards and timing of construction
would be satisfactory to the Bank. The latter mentioned cofinancers and GOL
would also finance a large part of project costs such as salaries, operating
expenses, training and field establishment costs amounting to US$17.6 million,
including contingencies, in accordance with their own procurement procedures,
but in a manner and timing satisfactory to the Bank.
F. Disbursements
3.24      Bank Group funds of US$12.0 million would be disbursed under the
following categories:
Category I    -   100% of the foreign exchange costs of
directly imported seeds, polybags,
fertilizers, tools, and other materials
for the field establishment program or
80% of local costs if procured locally,
totalling US$2.9 million;
Category II   -   50% of the foreign exchange costs of the
palm oil mill equipment totalling US$4.8
million;
Category III  -   100% of the foreign exchange costs for
the barge and port installations at
Harper Port totalling US$1.3 million;
Category IV   -   100% of the foreign exchange costs of
directly imported equipment for the road
program or 80% of local costs if procured
locally, totalling US$0.9 million;
Category V    -   100% of the foreign exchange costs for
consultants' services and technical assistance
totalling US$1.1 million or 80% of local
expenditures;
Category VI   -   unallocated estimated at US$1.0 million.
An estimated schedule of disbursement is shown in Annex 4. Applications for
withdrawals from the loan would be fully documented.



- 22 -
G.  Accounta axid Audits
3.25      DOPC would keep records consistent with sound accounting practices and
adequately reflecting their operations and financial positions. Records would
show accounts of the smallholders development section separately which would
include a statement of account for each participating farmer. DOPC's accounts
would be audited annually by independent auditors acceptable to the Bank. Audited
accounts, balance sheets and operating statements would be submitted to the Bank
within four months of the end of the financial year.
IV. PROJECT IMPLEMENTATION
A. Organization
4.01      The project would be implemented by the Decoris Oil Palm Company Limited.
Appointees to its Board of Directors would include representatives from the
Ministries of Agriculture, Finance, Planning and Public Works, and DOPC's General
Manager.  DOPC,  as other corporations involved in agro-industrial development,
would be under the Ministry of Agriculture buit would work closely with the follow-
ing organizations: Ministry of Lands and Mines (HLM) which would assist farmers
in obtaining title to their lands; Ministry of Public Works (MPW), which is respon-
sible for road construction and maintenance of public roads in the project area;
Maryland County Superintendent's Office; the President's Office, which has power
to sell public lands and LPMC. DOPC was recently been established. The project
provides for a study of institutions in the oil palm sub-sector (para 3.17d).
Assurances were obtained at negotiations that the implementation of any recommen-
dations of the study would be in agreement with the Bank and any changes in the
status of DOPC shall be acceptable to the Bank.
B. The Decoris Oil Palm Company
4.02      Structure and Staffing.  GOL has appointed a Coordinator attached to the
Ministry of Agriculture to implement the start-up activities between now and April
1980 (para 3.22). By that time DOPC's senior managerial staff including the gene-
ral manager and financial controller would have taken up their positions. When
fully operational, DOPC would consist of five main divisions: Finance and Adminis-
tration, Estate Plantation, Smallholder Plantations, Engineering, and Processing and
Marketing (IBRD Chart No. 20389). The latter would be added in Project Year 6. 1/
DOPC's senior management would be provided by an international management firm,
acceptable to the Bank, operating under a management agreement also acceptable to
the Bank.  A condition of project effectiveness would be the signing of the agree-
ment. At negotiations it was agreed that GOL would consult the Bank from time to
time about the future need of management services to be provided by an international
firm or organization and an assurance was obtained that if for any reason the
management agreement is terminated GOL would enter into another agreement with another
international firm under terms and conditions acceptable to the Bank.
1/ DOPC's functions and responsibilities of its senior managerial staff are found
in Project File Working Paper C5.



- 23 -
4.03      When the project is fully operational, the senior management staff
would compromise: General Manager, Financial Controller, Estate Plantations
Manager, Assistant Estate Plantations Manager, Smallholder Plantations Manager,
Roads Engineer, Chief Mechanic, Mill Engineer and Mill Manager. Personnel
recruited to senior positions would be acceptable to the Bank. As there is a
general shortage of Liberians with experience in oil palm production, it is
expected that initially the key staff, comprising the General Manager, Finance
Controller, Estate Plantation Manager, Mill Engineer and Mill Manager, would
be recruited internationally. The management firm however should make every
effort to find qualified Liberians whenever possible. The management agreement
(para 4.02) would be for a period of at least 4 years. It would specify that
Liberian personnel would be provided with training abroad and on-the-job
managerial experience to enable them to fill senior managerial and technical
positions at an early stage. Details of intermediate and lower level staff
requirements and phasing are shown in Project File Working Paper C7.
4.04      Programming, Budgeting and Reporting.  At the start of the financial
year DOPC would prepare annual budgets which would be presented to the Bank
and prepare cash flow statements showing operating costs, revenues and capital
requirements. Monthly statements, which would be the basis of management
actions, would be reviewed by DOPC's Board. Based on the Board's approved
budget, GOL would make quarterly budgetary allocations and thereafter make
available to DOPC all necessary funds promptly as needed. DOPC would keep
records, have their books audited and submit financial reports as specified
in para 3.25. In addition DOPC would submit to the Bank quarterly progress and
annual reports. At negotiations assurances were obtained on the above mentioned.
In addition, the deposit of not less then US$0.9 million (to cover expenditures during
the first quarter of Project Year 1) by GOL into DOPC's bank account should be a
condition of effectiveness.
4.05      Monitoring and Evaluation.  Under the project technical assistance
would be provided for strengthening the Monitoring and Evaluation Unit of MA's
Planning Division. An Agricultural Economist would be employed there with responsi-
bility for monitoring the financial and technical progress of the project, as well
as other ongoing oil palm projects, evaluating its economic and social impact
and establishing the data base for planning a follow-up project. 1/ This staff
would have complete access to all DOPC's records including those of the initial
auditor.  In the initial stages particular attention would be paid to field
development costs. The qualifications and experience, terms and conditions of
employment including terms of reference would be satisfactory to the Bank. At
negotiations an assurance to this effect was obtained from Government.
4.06      Implementation Schedule.  An implementation schedule for all technical
operations is shown in IBRD Chart No. 20224. Further details in timing for
field establishment, oil mill and port facilities are shown in Project Working
File Papers Nos. 1 and 4. To avoid slippage GOL would carry out the start-up
activities in para 3.21.
1/ Some socio-economic data on farmers in the project area has already been
collected by MA and is available in the Project Files; however, further
data would be collected during implementation. Some suggested TOR for a
Base Line Survey are available in Project File Working Paper C5.

V. AGRICULTURAL PRODUCTION AND TECHNOLOGICAL SPECIFICATIONS
A. Production and Yields
5.01      By 1993 the project would be in full production with average annual
production estimated at 109,000 tons ffb. Seventy-one percent or 77,000 tons
ffb of this would be produced by the nucleus estate and 31,000 tons ffb by
smallholders. At extraction rates of 22% for palm oil and 4% for palm kernel,
this would yield about 24,000 tons of palm oil and 4,300 tons of palm kernel.
Harvesting would begin in 1986, four years after the first trees are planted,
when total production would amount to about 13,800 tons ffb.
5.02      The planting material to be used is well adapted to soil and climatic
conditions in the project area. In Ivory Coast peak yields on well managed
estates under conditions similar to those in the project area are about 17 tons
ffb/hectare/ year.   For project evaluation purposes, these yields have been
reduced to 91% to compensate for possible reduction due to unforeseen manage-
ment and ecological difficulties. Yields for the nucleus estate at full
maturity have thus been estimated at 15.5 tons ffb/ha, and those for small-
holders at 12.5 tons ffb/ha to adjust for lower standards of maintenance and
less rigorous harvesting schedules (see Table 3). 1/

File Working Paper No. Cl.



- 25 -
B. Cultivation Techniques
5.03      The expected project yields would be obtained if certain basic
practices are followed. These are well known and have been successfully
implemented in neighbouring countries like the Ivory Coast. The project would
therefore: (i) use seeds of high yielding planting material (hybrids between
Deli Dura and African pisifera); (ii) raise seedlings in two stage polybag
nurseries with correct manuring and watering; (iii) cull all abnormal seedlings
at the end of both nursery stages; (iv) avoid all soil disturbance during land
preparation; (v) sow adequate quantities of cover crops; (vi) plant seedlings
in the field during the rainy season; (vii) control weeds, protect plants
against rodents, and manure adequately; and (viii) harvest completely according
to a rigorous weekly schedule. Details on the above are found in Project File
Working Paper Cl.
C. Oil Mill
5.04      As the bedrock in the project area is very thick, it is uneconomical
to supply water to the mill and staff housing by borehole and underground
pumps. Surface water would therefore be pumped from the Bolulu Creek or any
of its tributaries, filtered and chlorinated (for home use only). Preliminary
analysis of the water has shown that it is suitable for that purpose. However,
to ascertain the precise technical specifications of the water treatment
station to be constructed under the project, water samples would be taken and
analyzed every month for at least one year.
D. Environmental Considerations
5.05      In preparing the designs for the oil mill and port facilities, the
consultants (para 3.17, a, b) will be required to consider the implications
for the environment arising out of the operations of these facilities.
Specifically, the consultants will examine the problems that might be assoc-
iated with the disposal of liquid wastes and air pollutants from the palm oil
mill; and, the storage and transfer of oil at the port site. The consultants
will avail themselves of the Bank's environmental guidelines and be assisted
in this undertaking by the Bank's Environmental Affairs Office, as may be
appropriate.

VI. MARKETS, PRICES, FINANCIAL ANALYSIS
A. Markets
6.01      There would be no difficulty in selling project production.
About 75% would be sold abroad.  The export market for palm,oil is ogod, and
is expected to remain so in future.  Between 1960 and 1976, consumption of
fats and oils worldwide expanded steadily with an average annual rate of
increase of 3.6%.  Over the last decade there have been significant shifts in
consumption of fats and oils away from animal fats in favor of vegetable oils.
Even though the overall demand for fats and oils is inelastic, that for palm
oil and other individual oils such as palm oil is highly elastic (mainly
because of substitution effects). For example palm oil now accounts for about
12% world export market but this is expected to grow to about 24%-by 1990.
Production from projects currently being planned and implemented in Liberia
estimated at about 50,000-60,000 tons would not have any significant impact on
world production and exports. In 1978 world production of palm oil was 3.4
million tons and exports 2.1 million tons. By 1990 world production is expected
to increase to about 7.9 million tons and exports 6.6 million tons.
6.02      Recent developments in West African markets are also significant
for Liberia. At present an increasing share of the palm oil produced in
West Africa is being consumed domestically. Between 1955 and 1974 palm
oil exports from these countries dropped by 60%. The decline in exports
was highest in the case of Nigeria whose export share fell from over 30%
during the late fifties to less than 1% in 1974. Nigeria is now a net
importer. In the same country in aggregate terms total consumption of fats
and oils is predicted to rise from 565,000 tons in 1976 to 762,000 tons in
1980 and 978,000 tons by 1985. By that time imports to Nigeria were projected
at about 200,000 tons. Nigeria is therefore a potentially attractive market
for Liberian palm oil.
6.03      About 25% of project production would be sold locally.  Domestic
consumption of palm oil in 1978 was estimated at about 10,000 metric tons.
This is expected to grow at about 3% per annum reaching 15,000 tons by 1990.
In addition Liberia is currently setting up a palm oil processing factory
which would produce refined oil and other oil based products. The factory
would process a minimum of 50 metric tons of palm oil per day, and it would
require about 15,000 tons of palm oil by 1982. Its raw material requirement
would be met from local sources including part of the output (about 6,000
metric tons of palm oil) from the proposed Decoris project.
B.  Prices
6.04      International prices (c.i.f. Europe) for palm oil and palm kernel
average about US$577 and US$332 per metric ton respectively in 1979. Follow-
ing the forecasts of the Banks Commodities Division, palm oil prices (CIF Europe,
1979 constant terms) are expected to rise to about US$616 per metric ton by



- 27 -
1982; but drop to about US$512 per metric ton by 1990 when proj  t output is
in full production. Palm kernel prices are expected to rise t about US$362
per ton by 1982 and rise furtter to about US$369 per ton by 1 90. Prices
used in the analysis are US$443 per ton for palm oil and US$ 86 per ton for
palm kernel.  These are ex-mill gate values and are based on the Bank's
forecasted reference price for these two products for 1990 expressed in 1979
constant terms after deductions for freight, insurance, sales commissions,
handling and other charges as shown in Annex 5, Table 1. Producer prices
are estimated at US$58 per ton ffb after allowing for processing, transportation
and other charges. A producer price around this level would provide adequate
incentives to smallholders (para 6.05). Actual producer prices would be
determined by an Oil Palm Pricing Committee (OPPC) which GOL would set up
by January 1, 1985. OPPC would include representatives of the Ministries of
Agriculture, Commerce, Finance, Planning, DOPC and smallholders. In estab-
lishing the price OPPC would use the results of an oil palm pricing study
which would be carried out by independent consultants financed under the
project (para 3.17). The pricing formula would be acceptable to the Bank.
Assurances related to the foregoing were obtained.
C. Farmer Benefits
6.05      An illustrative cash flow for a 2.5 ha farm in shown in Annex 3,
Table 1.  The farm would be developed over a 2 year period.  Production
starts in the fourth year after planting and reaches full bearing in the
eight year. Assuming a farm gate price of US$58 per ton ffb (para 6.04),
the annual cash income (constant 1979 terms) from a 2.5 ha farm at full
development would be about US$1,150. This is much higher than the US$100
per annum which the majority of farmers in the project now earn. Net returns
per man day would start at about US$4.07 per day worked in the first year of
production and reach US$8.70 at full development. These returns compare
favorably with the US$5.50 per day obtained from commercial rubber plantations
where improved planting material is being used. Farmers are expected to work
an average of 110-120 days full time per year on their oil palm plantations;
they would therefore have enough time to also farm their food crops (para 3.09).
D. Financial Implication for DOPC
6.06      DOPC's projected cash flow, profit and loss statement and balance
sheet (all figures in 1979 constant terms) are shown in detail in Annex 3,
Tables 2, 3 and 4 respectively. The company's debt/equity ratio is 1:1.09
with a total government investment in equity of US$25.3 million. While the
trees are maturing and the mill is under construction, there would be some
cash deficit; but these are overcome by Year 10. The financing gap of US$3.0
million from Years 6 to 9 would be met from medium-term borrowing from local
banks. This loan which would be for a period of 10 years with a 5 year grace
period at 10% annual interest rate would be arranged by Government (para 3.20).
DOPC would show surpluses in its annual cash position after debt service from Year



- 28 -
11 onwards. The Company would be in a healthy financial position when trees
mature and the mill is in full operation by Year 13. The annual cash surpluses
increase from US$0.8 million in Year 13 to US$1.4 million by Year 20. DOPC
projected profit and loss statement shows that it would experience losses
between Years 6 to 10. However these losses decline from US$2.9 million in
Year 6 to US$1.6 million in Year 9 when all trees are in full production. DOPC
shows a profit from Year 11 onwards. Annual profits increase steadily from
US$0.9 million in Year 11 to US$1.8 million in Year 13 and US$3.3 million from
Year 20 onwards. The financial rate of return to the Company is 15%. Although
projected balance sheets show an increase in capital (equity plus cumulative
profits) from US$21.9 million in Year 6 to US$23.9 million in Year 15, it is
expected that total capital would be at least US$58.5 million by Year 20.
Government intends to use any excess profits from DOPC to develop its oil palm
industry.
E. Financial Implication for Government
6.07      An illustrated cash flow for GOL is shown in Annex 3, Table 5.  The
cumulative deficit amounts to US$30.0 million by Project Year 9. GOL would arrange
further financing of about US$3.0 million for Years 6 to 9 to bring all trees to maturity
and the mill into full production. This would be in addition to the US$11.8
million which it contributes to total project costs. DOPC begins to repay its
loan in Project Year 9 with annual repayments of US$4.0 million; from Year 9 to
Year 25, the cumulative deficits decline to US$4.5 million. This entire deficit
can be wiped out by Year 25 if DOPC pays GOL dividends from the US$32.0 million
profits which it accumulates by Year 25. An assurance was obtained at negotia-
tions that DOPC shall declare dividends out of its surplus in amounts at levels
acceptable to the Bank provided that dividends are not declared unless DOPC's
net profit in any fiscal year exceeds 5% of its equity.
VII. BENEFITS AND JUSTIFICATIONS
A. Project Benefits
7.01      The project would meet Government's twin objectives of increasing
foreign exchange earnings and providing employment for rural farm families.
The principal direct benefit from the project would be the additional annual
production of 24,000 tons of palm oil and 4,300 tons of palm kernel. By
1993, additional net foreign exchange earnings in 1979 constant dollars would
be about US$11.0 million annually. The project would have a permanent staff
of about 1,060 people drawn from the Decoris area and employ about 1,200
people during the development phase. The project would also provide cash
incomes for at least 1,000 farm families (7,000 people). They would earn
about US$950 per family per annum compared to their present cash incomes of
US$100 per family per year. The average skilled worker on the estate would
earn about US$1,200 per annum which compares very favorably with incomes of
similar type of workers on the nearby Firestone rubber and LIBSUCO sugar
plantations.



- 29 -
7.02      The project would involve training at least 1,500 people in oil
palm production techniques. Access and feeder roads and bridges across the
Deyea Creek and Decoris River would provide the needed infrastructure for
about 30,000 people residing in the villages in the immediate vicinity of the
project and set the stage for further development in the area. Benefits
which were not quantified in the rate of return calculations are improved farm
to market transport conditions; these would assist the people in the whole
project area.
B. Economic Rate of Return
7.03      Assumptions used in computing the project's internal rate of
return (ERR) are listed in Annex 5, Table 1. The overall ERR for the project
is 12%. That for the estate component only is 11.5% and for the smallholder
component 12.5%-. Assuming a discount rate of 10%, the economic net present
value (NPV) of total project investment in 1979 constant dollar terms is
estimated at about US$5.02 million.
7.04      The official exchange rate of Liberia's currency is on par with
the U.S. dollar; however for the purposes of sensitivity analysis, a shadow
exchange rate of 1.10 Liberian dollars to the U.S. dollar was used. At this
rate the ERR is 13%.
7.05      The majority of farms in the project area are owner-operated.
There are not many opportunities for off-farm employment except for casual
work on absentee owner rubber farms. The sensitivity of the ERR was tested
assuming a value for the opportunity cost of farm labor, which
in this case is the value of the rice, cassava and palm oil smallholders
would be producing and collecting if they were not involved in oil palm
growing. This is estimated from budgets at about US 70 cents per day. At
this rate the ERR is also 12% (mainly because labor represents only 4% of
total project costs).
C. Sensitivity and Risk Analysis
7.06      Sensitivity analysis was used to determine which variables would
be most crucial to the success of the project. As a measure, the cross-over
value was used. The cross-over value is the value of the variable tested for
which NPV discounted at 10% is zero and is a measure of how far the variable
can differ from its most likely value before the project becomes economically
unacceptable. The cross-over value may therefore be interpreted as the value
of the variable tested beyond which the ERR would be below the estimated
opportunity cost of capital. This is assumed at 10% for Liberia. Sensitivity
to changes in the most critical variables are discussed below.



- 30 -
7.07      Yields and Extraction Rates:  The project is especially sensitive to
changes in yields. The cross-over ffb yield for the nucleus estate is 13.5
tons ffb/ha against appraisal estimates of 15.5 tons ffb/ha and that for
smallholders is 9.7 tons ffb/ha against appraisal estimates of 12.5 ffb/ha.
Given the ecological conditions of the project area (good soils and annual
water deficit of 60 mm per annum), the yield potential of the planting material
(17-18 tons ffb/ha), experience under similar conditions in the Ivory
Coast , and the precaution taken in putting in an experienced management team,
it is highly unlikely that yields over the life of the project would drop to
the cross-over values mentioned to cause the project to fail economically.
Nevertheless, to minimize this risk, project management would pay particular
attention to the cultivation techniques discussed in Section V of this report.
The management team would also have the responsibility of training Liberians
in oil palm techniques so that project would be assured continued good manage-
ment. The project is sensitive to palm oil extraction rates. The cross-over
extraction rate is 19.5% against appraisal estimates of 22%. The main safe-
guard against the risk of lower extraction rates would be to ensure that the
mill is well managed and maintained at all times. The mill engineer and mill
manager must be both very experienced. An ample stock of spare parts and a
fully equipped workshop are necessary. The project has provided for these.
In addition Liberian staff who would eventually run the mill would receive
adequate training. The project is less sensitive to palm kernel extraction
rates. The cross-over value is 0.8% compared to appraisal estimates of
4%.
7.08      Prices:  The project is also sensitive to changes in palm oil
prices. The cross-over value of palm oil price is US$455 per ton (in 1979
constant terms) compared to appraisal estimates of US$512;per ton. However
project viability would be relatively insensitive to changes in palm kernel
prices. Its cross-over value is US$15 per ton (in 1979 constant terms)
against appraisal estimates of US$369. It is highly unlikely that prices
would drop so low as to make the project unviable. Historically, Bank
projections of palm oil and palm kernel prices have been 15-20% lower than
current world prices. Indications are the market for palm oil would continue
to be good; the Bank has forecasted a drop of only 0.6% by 1990 (in 1977
constant terms).
7.09      Development Period:  It is possible that full project development
might be delayed because of delays in land clearing due to machinery breakdown,
late delivery of inputs, low rates of smallholder uptake, etc. These would
have serious effects on project viability. If benefits are delayed a year
and the costs remain unchanged, the ERR is 10.1%. If the project is delayed,
it is highly likely that costs will increase as well because of inflation.
With a lag of 1 year and a cost increase of 10%, the ERR is 9%. It is there-
fore extremely important that the project management adhere as closely as
possible to the implementation schedules shown in Chart 20389. It is also
very important that GOL carry out the start-up activities (para 3.21) as
agreed. It is particularly important to get the smallholder program off the
ground in the first year of the project period. Delay in implementation of
these would lead to delays in achievement of the targets set out in the
appraisal estimates.



- 31 -
7.10      Mill Construction:  If the mill construction is delayed by a year
and all other project activities are achieved on time, the ERR drops from 12%
to 10%. Project management would therefore have to pay close attention to
the implementation schedule shown in Chart 20389. The project would be able
to withstand modest increases in the mill equipment and construction costs.
In fact, mill costs would have to go up by 62% before the project becomes
unviable. It could however safely withstand cost increases up to 30%, as the
ERR would then still be 10.8%.
7.11      Field Establishment Costs:  Modest increases in the two biggest items
in field establishment costs do not have a big effect on project viability.
Should land clearing costs go up by 10%, the ERR would still be 11.5% and for
a 10% increase in the cost of fertilizer, the ERR would be the same.
7.12      Wage Rates:  The project would also withstand modest increases in
the wage rates. If laborers' wages increase 10% per annum each year of the
development period, i.e. up to 1985, the ERR is 11.5%. Wages of laborers
would have to increase more than 100% before the project becomes unviable.
For 100% increase in labor costs, the ERR is 10,01%.
7.13      In summary, management would have to pay close attention to timely
land clearing, delivery of inputs, appropriate cultivation techniques and
mill operating efficiency. Any serious lowering of yields and extraction
rates and delaying of the project target would make the project unviable.
7.14      There are no unusual project risks.  The project would be managed
by an international firm with considerable oil palm experience. The project's
technical package has been well tested under similar conditions in neighboring
Ivory Coast. The project area seems to be particularly well adapted for oil
palm production with an average annual rainfall of 2,200 mm and an average
annual water deficit of only 60 mm. There is some risk of delay in the
rate of development of the smallholder plantations which would be overcome
with assistance from DOPC and GOL.
VIII. AGREENENTS, CONDITIONS AND RECOMMENDATION
8.01      During negotiations assurances were obtained from Government that:
(a) GOL would acquire and transfer to DOPC by September 1980
for a period of not less than 50 years additional land
required to establish 5,000 ha of plantation; and that
settlers displaced from lands to be used for the nucleus
estate and smallholder block plantations would be compen-
sated on terms satisfactory to the Bank (3.05);
(b)  DOPC would make necessary arrangements with IRHO and/or
other suitable suppliers for the supply of all project
seed requirements (3.07);

the mill construction and implementation of the works and
that the consultants' terms and conditions of the contract
would be acceptable to the Bank (3.12);
(g) DOPC would employ consultants to prepare final designs for
roads and bridges and prepare tender documents and that the
consultants' terms of reference and conditions of employment
would be acceptable to the Bank (3.14);
(h) GOL would maintain all roads in the project area other than
those roads to be maintained by DOPC (para 3.14) and would
construct by December 31, 1981, 35 km of feeder roads linking
smallholder plantations including supporting culverts and
bridges; rehabilitate 9 km of the Fishtown-Harper road and
resurface 5 km of the Plibo-Harper road (3.15);
(i) DOPC would employ consultants to design and supervise con-
struction of port facilities at Harper; prepare a follow-
up oil palm project under terms and conditions acceptable
to the Bank (3.17);
(j)  GOL would employ consultants to review the oil palm industry
in Liberia and to develop and advise OPPC on a pricing formula

acceptable to the Bank (3.17);
(k) GOL would arrange finances required by DOPC in an amount of
about US$3.0 million between Years 6 and 9 to bring all
plantings to maturity and the mill into operation (3.20);



- 33 -
(1) DOPC would ensure that loans to smallholders would be at
an interest rate of at least 12.5% for 13 years including
a 6-year grace period for principal and interest during
which interest would be capitalized and that GOL's relending
rate to DOPC and DOPC's onlending interest rate to small-
holders would be reviewed annually in consultation with the
Bank with the view to maintaining an adequate interest rate
(3.21);
(m) Implementation of any recommendations resulting from the study
of institutions in the oil palm sub-sector would be in agree-
ment with the Bank and any change in the status of DOPC shall
be acceptable to the Bank (para 4.01);

as specified by the Bank would be submitted and that funds
would be made available to DOPC promptly as needed in the
quarter they are required (4.04);

1985 and establish a pricing formula for smallholder ffb which
would be acceptable to the Bank (6.04);
(p) DOPC shall declare dividends out of its surplus in amounts
and levels acceptable to the Bank provided that dividends
shall not be declared unless DOPC's net profit in any fiscal
year exceeds 5% of its equity (6.07).
8.02      Conditions of effectivness would be that:
(a) Government would have acquired and leased to DOPC for a period of not
less than 50 years the 8,350 ha (44% of which would be under
plantations) for which detailed soil surveys have already been
completed (3.05);
(b)  A subsidiary finance agreement between GOL and DOPC satisfactory

cluded (3.21);
(c) DOPC has signed a management agreement with an international
firm acceptable to the Bank (4.02);
(d)  A deposit of not less than US$0.9 million has been made by
GOL inot DOPCts account (4.04).



- 34 -

DECORIS OIL PALM PROJECT
Assumptions Underlying Rate of Return Calculations
1.    Project Life:  Assumed to be 30 years including a 7 year investment
period during which development activities would be
completed.
2.    Project Costs:  (i)  all costs are expressed in end 1979 prices net
of identifiable taxes and duties;
(ii)  cost estimates include physical contingencies
at the level specified in para 3.19;
(iii) the opportunity cost for unskilled farm labor is
assumed to be US$1.00 per day;
(iv)  rice which is provided at the rate of 1 bag (60
kilos) per smallholder farm family per month is
costed at its full market value;
(v) road maintenance costs have been included for
the full project life.
3.    Project Benefit:  Expected future yields and production are shown in
Project File Working Paper C6.
(i) Project benefits comprise the value of incre-
mental palm oil and palm kernel priced at their
ex-mill gate value (for details see Annex 5,
Table 1), which are based on the Bank's commodity
price forecasts for palm oil and palm kernel;
Malaysian, 5%, C.I.F. N.W. European.
(ii) Additional non-agricultural benefits from improved
roads and rural infrastructure are not included
in the calculations;
(iii) No salvage value is assumed at the end of the
project's economic life.
4.    Using the foregoing assumptions and discounting costs and benefits over
a 30 year evaluation period, the economic rate of return for the project is
12%. Assuming a discount ratio of 10%, the estimated opportunity cost of
capital in Liberia, the economic net present value (NPV) of project invest-
ment in 1979 terms is US$5.02 million.
