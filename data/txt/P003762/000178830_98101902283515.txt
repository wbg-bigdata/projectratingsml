REPORT AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT
TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS ON A PROPOSED LOAN
TO THE REPUBLIC OF INDONESIA
FOR A TEACHER TRAINING PROJECT
1.        I submit the following report and recommendation on a proposed
loan to the Republic of Indonesia for the equivalent of $19 million to help
finance a Teacher Training Project. The loan would have a term of 20 years,
including 4-1/2 years' of grace, with interest at 8.2% per annum.
PART I - THE ECONOMY
2.        The last economic report on Indonesia, "Indonesia:   Recent
Developments and Medium-Term Perspective," of March 8, 1977 (1516-IND)
described the recovery of the economy from the world recession and the
financial troubles of Pertamina, the state oil company, and examined some
of the important development issues which the country faces in the next few
years.
3.        During Indonesia's First Development Plan period (1969/70-1973/74)/1,
the rehabilitation of the Indonesian economy was almost completed. Transport,
power, irrigation works and other infrastructure facilities, after years of
neglect, were greatly improved and strengthened. Agricultural output expan-
ded at an average rate of 4.5% a year and foundations of modern industry -
fertilizer, cement, etc. - were laid. During this period, the annual rate
of economic growth exceeded 7.5%; domestic savings and investment also rose
rapidly. With the start of the Second Development Plan period (1974/75-
1978/79), the Government expected that rehabilitation would be completed and
a start made on a course of long-term development which would assure not only
a satisfactory rate of economic growth but also a wider distribution of
income. The first two years of the Plan were dominated by the developments
in the oil sector - the sharp increase in the price of oil and Pertamina's
serious financial difficulties. The latter arose from Pertamina's under-
taking of a large and diversified investment program without arranging
satisfactory financing. With the onset of the world recession, bank credit
became much more restrictive. Pertamina was unable to roll over its short-
term debt and failed to meet the financial obligations which were falling
due. In the event, the Government stepped in and undertook to honor the oil
company's obligations. The repayment of these obligations, along with the
fall in export earnings as a result of the recession, necessitated large
foreign commercial borrowing, seriously strained the Government's budgetary
resources and Indonesia's balance of payments, and led to a sharp decline in
the foreign exchange reserves.

4.        During 1976/77 Indonesia's exports recovered strongly following
improvements in the world economy, and rose to a level higher than expected
earlier. Imports continued to increase rapidly, but the rate of price
increase slowed down and Indonesia's terms of trade improved. Most of
Pertamina's short-term debt had been repaid by the end of 1975/76, and
disbursements on foreign borrowing continued to be high in 1976/77. As a
result, Indonesia's foreign exchange reserves rose to a more comfortable
level, i.e. $1.2 billion at the end of 1976 (and even higher levels in recent
months) corresponding to about two months of imports.
5.        The Government's budgetary position was also much better in 1976/77.
With the boost in oil exports and a further renegotiation of oil contracts,
oil revenues rose by close to 40%. Non-oil revenues also rose over and above
the amounts budgeted, mainly as a result of Government efforts to curb
smuggling and a more rigorous collection of customs duties. The additional
revenues together with continued restraint in increasing current expenditures
enabled the Government not only to increase development expenditures substan-
tially but also to repay the debt to Bank Indonesia, which it had incurred in
the previous year. This helped to neutralize the monetary expansion on
account of the accumulation of foreign exchange reserves. The rate of
inflation over the year decreased, from a high of 17% in the first quarter to
only a modest increase in the last two quarters of 1976/77, giving an average
increase of less than 15% for the year as a whole.
6.        In 1976, the domestic economy recovered in other respects also.
The available indicators suggest that industrial output and private invest-
ment rose faster than in the previous two years. The output and prices of
tree crops rose with foreign demand, thus raising the incomes of the producers.
This provided a welcome relief to the small producers, who had suffered from
the declining foreign prices of their produce combined with rising domestic
prices of consumer goods. However, the production of food crops slackened
and rice output failed to rise appreciably for the second year in succession.
The domestic price of rice was kept stable by means of very substantial
imports, which reached 1.6 million tons (about 10% of domestic consumption)
in 1976/77. Early in the year floods, and later on drought, affected both
the wet season and dry season harvests. More importantly, a pest infesta-
tion afflicted large areas in Java, particularly those planted with the high
yielding varieties of rice, and the area under BIMAS and INMAS (the two
credit extension schemes for rice growers) remained fairly constant over the
last three years following a rapid increase during the First Development
Plan period. Rice output also failed to increase because the use of
fertilizer did not rise despite ample availability. The Government has now
relaxed controls on the distribution of fertilizer and set its fertilizer/rice
price ratio at a level that should encourage fertilizer use.
7.          The large increase in the oil revenues over the past three years
has been invested, not consumed. Government development expenditures more
than quadrupled over this period and in 1976/77 amounted to Rp 2 trillion
(or about $5 billion); even after allowing for the high rate of inflation
development expenditures rose in real terms by 35% a year. Rough estimates
indicate that at present more than 20% of GNP is being invested in Indonesia.



- 3 -
8.        The effect of the high level of investment expenditures, however,
cannot yet be seen in the growth of the Indonesian economy. In fact, the
economic growth in the first three years of Indonesia's Second Development
Plan, i.e. 1974/75 - 1976/77, has been somewhat slower than the observed
long-term trend rate of 7.5% a year. The world recession, uncertainties
following the Pertamina crisis and domestic inflation (which made certain
domestic industries uncompetitive with imports), all had a dampening effect
on the growth of the economy. Indonesia's growth rate also failed to accel-
erate because the economic benefits from investments in recent years have
been slow in coming and because the growth in the private sector slackened.
New investment has been concentrated on relatively capital-intensive indus-
trial and infrastructure projects with long gestation periods; some projects,
such as Krakatau steel and the LNG, have been further delayed by slow imple-
mentation. Moreover, the realization of economic benefits from investments
in such sectors as transportation, telecommunications, etc. depends on the
growth in demand which in turn is determined by the growth of the rest of the
economy, which in Indonesia is mostly the private sector. Unfortunately, the
private sector seems to have failed to provide the necessary momentum of
growth. The indications are that investments in this sector, because of the
Government's attempts to control domestic inflation or because of the world
recession, rose only modestly in the first two years of the Plan.
9.        The orientation of the public sector investments was partly affected
by the Government's takeover of Pertamina's projects in the non-oil sector,
but was also a result of its attempt to raise investment rapidly in response
to the sharply rising oil revenues. It was easier and quicker to develop
capital-intensive projects; plans for several of them in fact existed even
before the improvement in public finances. On the other hand, new projects
in such sectors as rural development, transmigration, health and education
generally required not only innovation but also setting up new institutions.
Nevertheless, the Government views the orientation of its investment program
with some concern. As part of its efforts to rescue Pertamina from bankruptcy,
it initiated a careful review of all public sector investment proposals and
strengthened its control over the direction of investments. Where practicable,
the Government rejected or scaled down costly proposals. The budget for
1977/78 provides for a larger share of development expenditures in such
sectors as agriculture, health, family planning, education and regional
development.
10.      Reliable data on the recent trends in employment are not available.
The labor force has been increasing at a rate of more than one million
persons a year, but the current,level of unemployment and the extent of
underemployment are not known. While considerable investment activity and
general economic prosperity is in evidence in urban and rural areas of
Indonesia, there is no indication that the labor market has tightened or that
the wages of unskilled workers have more than kept pace with domestic infla-
tion. However, the Government's efforts at family planning appear to have
yielded impressive results. Preliminary estimates from an inter-censal
survey in 1976 indicate that since 1971 the birth rate in Java and Bali has
significantly declined.
11.        The long-term consequences of the Pertamina crisis remain in the
form of large foreign debt and burdensome unfinished investment projects.



The heavy foreign borrowing in the last two years has raised the level of
debt service, which is now expected to reach $1.87 billion by 1980 or close
to 17% of the projected export earnings compared to 13% in 1976. This does
not take account of the contingent liabilities incurred with regard to the
hire-purchase of tankers, the exact amount of which is subject to litigation.
12.       The prospects for Indonesia's export are generally good; the
principal constraint is expected to be quantities available for export rather
than foreign demand. Indonesia's export earnings, at least over the next
five years, are expected to rise rapidly and it should not be difficult to
meet the debt service obligations and still to finance essential imports of
consumer, intermediate and capital goods. However, to maintain the pace of
development, Indonesia will continue to need a substantial inflow of foreign
assistance on concessional terms. In order to keep the debt service burden
manageable, resort to commercial borrowing in the next few years will have to
be kept to a minimum. It is estimated that Indonesia will need $2.1 billion
in new external financing commitments in 1977, and about the same amount next
year, of which no more than one-third should be on commercial terms. At the
meeting of the Inter-Governmental Group on Indonesia (IGGI) in April 1977,
aid pledges of over $500 million from bilateral sources were made. The
likely commitments from those IGGI donor countries which did not pledge, from
the multilateral agencies and from OPEC and East European countries should
raise the total of official development assistance to $1.5 billion.
13.       The heavy foreign debt service requirements will also reduce the
public sector resources available for investment. The net resource transfers
from abroad are expected to decline from $1.56 billion in 1976/77 to about
$640 million in 1980/81, or from about 5% to 1% of GNP. In order to maintain
the high rate of domestic investment already reached, the Government would
need to raise substantial additional revenue over the next few years, the
bulk of which would have to come from non-oil sources. The additional
revenue raising effort is also necessary to keep inflation under control.
The Government has already taken steps in this direction; income tax proced-
ures have been simplified and import duties are being more strictly enforced.
These measures as well as some additional ones need to be vigorously pursued.
14.       The medium-term outlook of the Indonesian economy is good.    Over
the last eight years, GNP rose at an average rate of 7.5% a year, and food
production expanded in step. This rate of growth could be maintained in
future if the rate of investment continues to be high and the orientation of
investments is shifted to less capital-intensive forms. Thus the Government's
efforts in mobilising domestic resources and careful investment planning
would be crucial in maintaining the relatively high rate of economic growth
and creation of employment opportunities. The Government would also need to
pay special attention to the production of rice, and food crops generally, so
that the recent setbacks remain a temporary pheonomenon.
PART II - BANK GROUP OPERATIONS IN INDONESIA
15.       The discussion in Part I of this report underscores the need for
a development program which provides productive work opportunities (with



-5-
resultant increased incomes) for Indonesia's presently underemployed and
growing labor force. Major efforts are needed to increase labor-intensive
employment and programs directed towards improving the incomes of the poor and
their living standards. To assist the Government in attaining its goals, the
Bank is planning to increase its commitments to Indonesia and in particular to
support projects designed to: improve agricultural credit; rehabilitate and
expand irrigation systems; assist transmigration and other land development
outside Java and Bali for and by smallholders; increase nonagricultural employ-
ment in the rural areas and small towns through the establishment of small-
scale industries, rural credit schemes as well as vocational and nonformal
education programs; develop the electric power system; construct urgently
needed water supply and transport facilities; and expand the national family
planning program.
16.       As of March 31, 1977, Indonesia had received 37 IDA credits totaling
$561.8 million and 23 Bank loans amounting to $1,155.5 million. At that date,
IFC investments totaled $59.7 million. The share of the Bank Group in
Indonesia's total external debt (disbursed) outstanding at the end of 1976
was about 6% and the share of debt service was less than 1%. By 1978 these
ratios are expected to increase to around 12% and 5%, respectively. A summary
statement of IDA Credits, Bank Loans and IFC Investments as of March 31,
1977, as well as notes on the execution of ongoing projects are contained in
Annex II.
17.       To date, agriculture accounts for just over one third of all Bank
lending to Indonesia, including four IDA credits for estate rehabilitation,
seven Bank loans and IDA credits for the rehabilitation and expansion of the
irrigation systems, two for fisheries, and one each for seeds production, beef
cattle, su*ar, smallholder tea, smallholder rubber, agriculture research,
food crop extension services, transmigration and nutrition development. The
Operations'and Evaluation Department of the Bank is undertaking a study of
Bank Group lending in the agricultural sector. In the industrial sector, the
Bank has assisted in three projects to expand PUSRI's fertilizer production
and distribution capacity, three for development finance companies (Government-
owned and private) which play a major role in fostering the growth of indus-
trial enterprises, and one for the Pulo Gadung industrial estate. Loans and
credits have also been extended to the education (including technical and
a,s,icultural education, textbook production, vocational and civil service
training), telecommunications, tourism, power generation and distribution,
transportation (including highways, inter-island shipping, railroads and
ports), population, urban and water supply sectors. Also a loan was extended
for a national resource survey and mapping project and four credits for
technical assistance to aid the Government in preparing and formulating its
development programs and projects.
18.       Bank lending to Indonasia started with an IDA Credit in 1968 for
irrigation rehabilitation; lending on Bank terms began in June 1974. Dis-
bursements on loans and credits are'now at satisfactory levels. The
Indonesian authorities have become increasingly aware of the cost to the
country of the delays in project execution caused by cumbersome procedures
and of the need to establish an effective control system in BAPPENAS (the
National Development Planning Agency). At the Government's request, the Bank
arranged in 1974'for assistance under the Fourth Technical Assistance Credit



- 6 -
(Credit 451-IND) to help set up a monitoring and control system. It is hoped
that the system which is due to commence operation shortly will lead to
better project administration.
19.       Six Loans have been made to Indonesia this fiscal year prior to the
proposed loan; two other loans are being presented to the Executive Directors
at this time, which would bring total lending to Indonesia this fiscal year to
$375.5 million. Projects for nucleus estate development, development finance
company (BAPINDO), population, small enterprise credit, rural credit and
non-formal education are expected to be ready for presentation in the next
several months.
Progress Under Previous Education Projects
20.       IDA has made three credits (totaling $24.4 million) and the Bank one
loan ($37 million) for education projects in Indonesia. These projects were
designed to develop skilled manpower in areas crucial to the economic and
social development of Indonesia and to improve the quality of the education
system. The first credit (Cr. 219-IND, 1970) financed the construction of
five centralized workshops (TTC) to strengthen practical instruction for 14
satellite senior secondary schools. The project was completed on schedule in
1976. The project completion report is being prepared. The second education
project (Cr. 288-IND, 1972) aims at upgrading and expanding middle level
agricultural training; the project is being implemented satisfactorily with
minor delays and 26 of the 27 project institutions have been completed. The
third project (Cr. 387-IND, 1973) is contributing to the improvement of basic
education through the production, testing and distribution of 138 million
primary school textbooks and the in-service training of 350,000 primary
school teachers and upgrading of 2,800 supervisors. The distribution of the
first 31 million textbooks has now been largely completed and in-service
teacher training is proceeding on schedule. The fourth education project
(Ln. 1237-IND, 1976) seeks to strengthen technical/vocational training and
civil service training; minor delays have occurred in obtaining initial tech-
nical expertise from UNESCO, ILO and UNOTC (United Nations Office for Techni-
cal Cooperation) but the technical assistance program is now progressing
satisfactorily. Delays have also occurred in site selection and land acqui-
sition for the manpower subproject. The performance of the project unit for
the manpower subproject has been unsatisfactory due to lack of experience,
staffing difficulties and office space problems. As a result, overall
project implementation is about 10 months behind schedule. These matters are
being followed up with the Government. The Borrower has substantially
complied with the covenants in the above-mentioned Credit and Loan Agreements.
III - THE EDUCATION SECTOR AND TEACHER TRAINING /1
Overview
21.       The formal system of education in Indonesia consists of a six-year
primary school cycle, lower and upper secondary cycles of three years each,
/1 Details on the education sector of Indonesia are included in Education
Sector Survey Report No. 443-IND, dated February 5, 1975.



and post-secondary education ranging from three to six years. In 1974 primary
education included about 17 million pupils in nearly 100,000 schools and
enrollments averaged about 80% of the school age population. In the same year
total secondary school enrollment was 2.2 million, or 24% of the age group
at the lower level and about 1.0 million, or 12% of the age group at the
upper level. Educational opportunities are unevenly distributed as illus-
trated by primary school enrollment ratios which range from 38% (West
Nusatenggara) to 92% in West Sumatera. Girls constitute 45% of enrollment at
the primary level and 35% at tHe upper secondary.
22.       The Government is committed to expand educational opportunities and
move towards a more equitable distribution of opportunities. The Government
has thus embarked on a major school construction program which aims by 1979 to
add 7.4 million primary school places. This program (part of a larger public
works program known as INPRES) aims to accommodate all eligible children in
grade one by 1984. Primary school enrollments are projected to grow to about
24 million in 1984 of which about 15% would be in schools outside the Ministry
of Education. Government investment in school facilities is also substantial
at the secondary level.
23.       A National Assessment Study on Education undertaken by the Govern-
ment between 1969 and 1973 identified a number of interrelated problems
affecting the quality of instruction. Curricula are often poorly related
to local conditions or the learning needs of students. Teaching materials
are scarce. A sizeable proportion of the teachers has not received formal
teacher training. Less than 45% of primary teachers have the most suitable
form of training and only one half of the lower secondary teachers any
teacher training at all. The prevailing teaching methods, in which lecturing
and rote learning predominate, tend to be inefficient and ineffective; they
waste student and teacher time through copying and repetition, do not require
students to analyze or solve problems and result in low learning achievements
(less than half of expected levels in a recent survey). In addition, low
teacher salaries force teachers to seek additional outside jobs to supplement
their income. Short school days, often less than three hours, sometimes
preclude the achievement of basic instructional objectives.
24.       As mentioned in para. 20, the Bank has provided assistance to
improve the quality of the education system in Indonesia, especially under
the third education project (Credit 387-IND). A preliminary evaluation of
implementation shows that the in-service teacher training under this project
is having a positive effect on teacher performance.
25.       Primary school teachers are trained in secondary level Institutes
(SPGs - grades 10-12), and secondary school teachers are trained in teacher
Colleges (IKIPs - mostly three years beyond grade 12). The number of annual
graduates at the primary level is about 15,000 and at the secondary level
about 3,000. As a result of the INPRES program, demand for primary teachers
will amount to 250,000 between 1974 and 1984 or about 25,000 per year. The
demand will be substantial at the secondary level also - 89,000 for the period
or 9,000 per year. Consequently there is need for a substantial expansion of
teacher training capacity. There is a major need also to increase the quality
of teachers entering the system. Both Institutes and Colleges perpetuate the
lecture and note taking methods and as a result, the graduates are unable to



implement the more active and varied teaching methods recommended by new
school curricula adopted in 1975. At colleges, students specialize in par-
ticular subjects even though most graduates are eventually expected to teach
broad subjects in schools. Curriculum adjustments, more relevant instruc-
tional materials and specialized facilities and staff training are needed to
improve quality.
Government Plans and Programs
26.       While increasing educational opportunities, the Government is making
serious efforts also to improve the quality of education. The substantial
number of new elementary school places being created under the INPRES program
will mean that a third of all classrooms will be less than five years old in
1979. At secondary level, facilities have also been improved by the supply of
libraries, laboratories and equipment. The Government has taken two other
major steps to improve quality: (a) new curricula have been developed for all
levels; and (b) textbooks provided under the third education project (Credit
387-IND) are being distributed and teachers are being trained in their use.
A fourth area crucial to improved learning achievements - quality of teaching
- is now being addressed. During this period of rapid school expansion, the
Government has an opportunity to train a large supply of new teachers to
enable them to use the new curricula, methods, and materials now being intro-
duced and thus to achieve increased learning among pupils. The Government
has formulated a program of reform and development of teacher education which
will take advantage of this opportunity
27.       To meet the projected demand for primary school teachers, the Gov-
ernment plans to consolidate the current uneconomic system of primary teacher
training and to increase the capacity of the consolidated system. The 205
public Institutes enrolling 55,000 students will be converted by 1984 into
126 Institutes enrolling about 100,000 students. Under the consolidation
program, the average size of public Institutes will increase from about 270
to 800 students. Annual output will increase from 15,000 teachers to 25,000,
the estimated demand in the early 1980s. The consolidation program is both
desirable and feasible. The larger enrollment size of the Institutes will
ease management of the teacher training system and facilitate use of staff
and facilities. The consolidation program has also been designed to give a
better balance between supply and demand for teachers by region. A plan has
been prepared which identifies the institutions to be expanded and those to
be converted to other purposes. Most of the consolidation will be achieved
by converting the second and third Institutes in a city to other purposes,
thus minimizing problems of student and staff relocation. Construction has
already been budgeted for the first group of Institutes to be expanded under
this consolidation program. To meet the demand for secondary school teachers
enrollments in secondary teacher training institutions will be increased
primarily by expanding a one-year diploma program for junior secondary school
teachers.
28.       However, to gain the full benefit of the planned teacher increase,
substantial improvements are required also in the quality of instruction
offered at teacher training Institutes and Colleges. An initial step in this
direction was a new Institute curriculum developed in 1975 to conform to the



- 9 -
new primary school curriculum and the new role envisioned for teachers.
However, its first year of use revealed major gaps, and adjustments are thus
planned in both Institute and College curricula. These curricula should
emphasize broad subject preparation, the use of varied training methods and
include an increased proportion of practical work on the part of trainers.
As a consequence, there would be a need to provide specialized facilities for
the practical elements of teacher training. There would also be a need to
develop materials and retrain the staff of teacher education Institutes in
the use of the new curricula, facilities and materials. The proposed project
would support the Government's efforts to improve the quality of instruction
offered at teacher training Institutes and Colleges.
IV - THE PROJECT
Background
29.       The Government undertook a comprehensive National Assessment Study
on Education between 1969 and 1973 with the assistance of the Ford Foundation.
A Bank education sector survey in November/December 1973 reviewed the findings
of the Assessment Study and identified, inter alia, the priority need for
improvements in teacher training. The sector survey recommended a primary
teacher training project to: (a) improve the way new teachers are trained;
(b) increase the average size of training institutes for improved economy;
and (c) achieve a better balance between supply and demand by region. It was
recommended that the size and regional distribution of the existing training
institutes be reviewed to bring about these improvements. The Office of Edu-
cational and Cultural Research and Development of the Ministry of Education
and Culture subsequently undertook a preinvestment study on teacher training
(November 1975). The study recommended a dual investment program, which
included: (a) quality related construction (specialized facilities) and the
required software (curriculum and materials development and staff training);
and (b) a parallel construction program aimed at expanding some Institutes to
optimal size while phasing out other Institutes which cannot be used economi-
cally. During preappraisal, the Government suggested, and the Bank agreed,
that external assistance should be concentrated on the comparatively more
difficult task of quality improvements with expansion of facilities to be
financed from local resources. The Government's suggestion was based on the
consideration that the facilities to be constructed were simple, mostly
classrooms and communal facilities, which would require little foreign
currency expenditures and expatriate assistance. It was therefore agreed to
proceed along these lines while making arrangements to ensure close coordina-
tion between both components of the program. The proposed project was
prepared on this basis in June 1976 by the Office of Educational and Cultural
Research and Development of the Ministry of Education and Culture with the
help of UNESCO. A Bank team appraised the project in November 1976. The
negotiations were held in Washington on April 18-21, 1977, the Government
delegation was led by Mr. Setijadi, Chairman of the Office of Educational and

Oblectives, Scope and Phasing
30.       The principal objective of the proposed project is to produce better
trained teachers by improving the knowledge and teaching skills of graduates
from teacher training institutions. The project includes interrelated com-
ponents which would:
(a) improve the content of teacher training programs;
(b) develop, produce and distribute related instructional materials for
teacher training in the national language;
(c) retrain about 7,000 teacher educators in new curricula and
teaching methods;
(d) provide specialized facilities (libraries, laboratories, workshops
and practice teaching rooms) at 15 Secondary Teacher Training
Colleges and 54 Primary Teacher Training Institutes and equipment
for an additional 14 Institutes; and
(e) develop improved selection procedures for prospective teachers and
support policy studies related to teacher utilization in schools
and preparatory studies for future education rojects.
The proposed project focuses on quality improvements, but would be closely
coordinated with the Government's expansion program for teacher training.
The proposed project covers both primary and secondary teacher training
in recognition of the need for improvements at both levels. The number of
institutions to be improved under the project (about half of the Institutes
to be retained under the consolidated system) represents a compromise between
maximum impact and feasible size of the project. The Government plans to
upgrade the remaining teacher training institutions under a second phase
program based on results from the proposed project.
31.       The project would be executed broadly in two phases:  a preparatory
phase of two years; and full scale replication over three-and-a-half years.
The preparatory phase would encompass local and foreign training of an
Indonesian team of 40 educators referred to in the following paragraph, the
development and testing of teaching programs and materials, and initial
equipment procurement and construction. A project monitoring system would be
developed and introduced in the preparatory phase. Based on evaluation of
initial trials, appropriate adjustments would be made in the implementation
targets, program and schedule before large-scale introduction.
Development of Professional Leadership (proposed outlay $1.7 million) /1
32.       A team of 40 Indonesian educators would be responsible for planning
and supervising changes in curricula, materials and teacher training under
/1 Proposed outlays do not include contingencies.

the project. The team would include staff members of Colleges and Institutes
as well as the Ministry of Education and Culture and provincial education
offices. The team members would undergo a three-month period of local
training and a five-month period of overseas training specially designed with
respect to their future duties.
33.       The proposed project would finance allowances,/l local and foreign
travel, and foreign training. The Government and the Bank have agreed
on selection criteria for the national team and on the outline and schedule
of the foreign study program. Members of the team would be required to work
full time exclusively on the project for a term of at least three years after
completion of their overseas training (Section 3.04 of the draft Loan Agreement).
34.       Curricula and Materials Development (proposed outlay $1.0 million).
Teacher education curricula and materials would be developed to enable gradu-
ating teachers to implement the 1975 school curricula more effectively. This
work would continue throughout the project, but would be most intense during
the one-year period after return of the national team from studies abroad.
Specific curricula changes would provide a broader subject preparation in
Colleges, emphasize new and more effective teaching methods and practice, and
introduce more relevant and practical content in all subjects. The instruc-
tional materials, mostly textbooks and teacher guides, would be distributed
to all teacher education institutions. All materials would be in the national
language. Printed matter would be supported by simple media such as charts,
filmstrips and cassette tapes. The national team would have the prime respon-
sibility for materials development assisted by subject matter specialists
employed on a contract basis. The team would work in close contact with
existing curriculum commissions.
35.       The proposed project would finance allowances, local travel and the
production and distribution of materials. The Government has prepared guide-
lines for the adjustment of teacher education curricula. These guidelines,
which were discussed and agreed with the Bank, provide inter alia for broad
subject matter preparation at Colleges and for increased proportion of time
for training in teaching methods at Institutes and Colleges. The Government
has agreed that curricula adjusted according to these guidelines would be
used at all Institutes and Colleges by January 1, 1981 (Section 3.09 of the
draft Loan Agreement).
36.       Physical Facilities (proposed outlay $20.4 million). Learning
Resource Centers, consisting essentially of libraries, laboratories and work-
shops, would be constructed and equipped at 15 Colleges and about 54 Insti-
tutes, and equipment would be provided to an additional 14 Institutes. These
facilities would enable teacher education institutions to train teachers in
new teaching methods and would also enable experimentation with new training
techniques. The facilities for Colleges would be larger and more specialized
than those at Institutes with average areas of 1,100 sq m and 400 sq m,
/1 Allowances are supplements to salary to compensate for secondary income
foregone. Similar allowances are being financed by the Bank under the
third education project (Credit 387-IND).



- 12 -
respectively. The facilities at Colleges would also serve any adjacent
In-Service Training Center (BPG). The 68 Institutes were selected to ensure
balanced regional coverage and to conform with the phasing of the Government's
consolidation program. The facilties provided under the project would com-
plement the classrooms and communal facilities being constructed by the
Government as part of its consolidation program.
37.       The proposed project would finance civil works and procurement of
furniture, equipment, library books and educational materials.
38.       Staff Training (Proposed Outlay:   $6.3 million).  An important part
of the project would be the training of staff at teacher training institutions
in the content and use of new curricula, teaching methods, materials and
project facilities. The project would retrain about 7,000 staff, or 60-80%
of the projected total for 1981, includlng College staff, Institute staff,
administrators, inspectors and technicians. The training programs would be
developed and tested by the national team with assistance from local and
foreign specialists during the year following studies abroad. Training would
be conducted by members of the national team at regional Colleges, assisted
by 100-200 selected College and Institute staff who would receive prior
instruction. The main training program will be conducted in two or three
phases after the trial phase, and after the necessary adjustments have been
made in the program. The proposed project would finance allowances, per
diem, and travel for trainers and trainees.
39.       Evaluation and Policy Studies (Proposed Outlay:   $300,000).   The
proposed project would finance evaluation and studies to help ensure achieve-
ment of project objectives and assist in overcoming basic sectoral problems.
A project monitoring system would be developed to assess job performance of
graduates and effects of new teaching methods. The information obtained from
the monitoring system would be used to identify weaknesses in project imple-
mentation as a basis for necessary adjustments and improvement. As a corol-
lary to the monitoring system, the project would also support the development
of improved methods of selecting students for teacher training and of stan-
dardized student achievement tests. The proposed project also includes funds
for preparatory work on future education projects. The Government has agreed
to submit to the Bank by July 1, 1979 its plan for continuous in-service
teacher training, covering program contents, length, means of training,
target groups and agency responsibility (Section 4.03 of the Loan Agreement).
It has also agreed to introduce improved methods and criteria for selecting
trainees at all Institutes and Colleges by January 1, 1981 (Sections 3.09 of
the Loan Agreement).
40.       The full impact of the improved teacher training to be accomplished
under the project depends to a large extent on finding solutions to problems
of teacher deployment. The project would therefore include policy studies to
help overcome key constraints on quality improvement in education. In partic-
ular, the project would help finance studies on teacher status (salaries and
working conditions) and use (multiple jobs and short school day). These
studies will conclude with an evaluation of various policy options available
to address the problems. The Government and the Bank agreed on the scope and



- 13 -
sequence of this policy review program. The Government also agreed to dis-
cuss the findings of these studies with the Bank (Section 3.11 of the draft
Loan Agreement).
41.       Technical Assistance.  The above mentioned project components
include 72 man-months of expert assistance and 240 man-months of foreign
fellowships. In addition, expert assistance at an estimated total outlay of
$200,000 would be provided for project management support including equipment
procurement specialists (6 man-months), and project advisors (36 man-months).
The qualifications and experience of these experts as well as the terms and
conditions of their employment would be acceptable to the Bank (Section 3.03
of the draft Loan Agreement).
Prolect Cost and Financing
42.       The estimated cost of the project is given in detail in Annex III.
The total cost (including contingencies) would be $42.8 million of which
$19.0 million, or about 44%, would be in foreign exchange. Physical contin-
gencies and projected price increases are estimated at about $13 million or
about 30% of the total cost. Customs duties and taxes amount to about 10% of
the total project cost, including contingencies, after allowing for the fact
that educational equipment imported directly by the Government would be
exempt from duties.
43.       The proposed Bank loan of $19 million would finance the foreign
exchange component of the project. The Government would provide in a timely
manner the remaining $23.8 million out of annual budget appropriations.
Implementation
44.       Management.  The project would be managed by the Teacher Training
Division of the Ministry of Education and Culture. This Division is also in
charge of implementing the Government's parallel construction program which
would supply the additional classrooms and communal facilities needed for
expansion of the Institutes. Similar procedures and the same staff would
be used for execution of both the project and the parallel program of the
Government, but additional staff would be appointed to manage the additional
workload which the project would entail.
45.       Since the project spans three major organizational units in the
Ministry of Education and Culture (the Office of Research and Development,
the Directorates General of Primary and Secondary and of Higher Education),
a Board of Directors has been formed and would be maintained to be responsible
for overall project planning, coordination and control (Section 3.01(c) of
the draft Loan Agreement). The Director of the Teacher Education Division,
within the Directorate General of Primary and Secondary Education, is the
Chairman of the Board and the Project Director. For the Teacher Education
Division the following key staff have been appointed to work full time on the
project: (a) assistant director; (b) curriculum and materials development



- 14 -
officer; (c) training officer; (d) evaluation officer; (e) architect; (f)
procurement officer; and (g) comptroller. These staff would be assisted by
advisors experienced in project management and procurement, and be provided
adequate supporting staff. At the provincial level, staff of the provincial
departments of education and public works are being designated to assist in
project implementation. They would have responsibility for site surveys,
site selection and acquisition if needed, and would participate in the review
of sketch plans, evaluation of bids for civil works, and site supervision.
The Government has agreed that the project management would continue to
submit joint budget requests covering construc tion of project facilities and
the Government's parallel program for expansion at project institutions
(Section 3.01(b) of the draft Loan Agreement).
46.       Professional services required for civil works and procurement of
furniture would be provided by a group of consultant architect firms, accep-
table to the Bank (Section 3.02 of the draft Loan Agreement). Qualified
firms have been contracted for overall planning, coordination, and cost
control and preparation of sketch plans and tender documents for both project
construction and the Government's expanpion program.
47.       Sites.  About 80% of project institutions have adequate land avail-
able for both the Learning Resource Centers and the parallel expansion pro-
gram. For the remaining 20%, additional land is being selected and acquired.
The Government has agreed that it would acquire adequate additional land as
necessary at each site not less than six months prior to the scheduled start
of construction at each site (Section 3.08 of the draft Loan Agreement). The
Government also agreed that site plans showing existing and intended construc-
tion (both for the project and the Government's expansion program) at each
location would be acceptable to the Bank (Section 3.07 of the draft Loan
Agreement).
48.       Implementation Schedule.   Coordination of the various project com-
ponents would be essential. Training, for example, could not start until
materials, facilities and the training program were completed and tested.
Following evaluation of the trial phase, two years after loan signing, it may
be necessary to revise the program and schedule for subsequent implementation,
for example by dividing training into more phases of smaller size. The
overall implementation period of the project, five-and-a-half years, would
allow flexibility to accommodate such changes, but could not be shortened
without substantially weakening its impact and effectiveness. The project is
expected to be completed by December 31, 1982.
49.       The Government has made good progress in preparing the project for
implementation. It has also already prepared the details of the parallel
construction works required under the consolidation program. Priorities of
this parallel construction program are consistent with the phasing of project
construction. Consultant architect firms have been contracted and have
started work on sketch plans and site surveys. Selection has begun for
members of the national team and their training program has been planned in
detail. A Ministerial Decree has been prepared for signature for the purpose
of establishing commissions to revise teaching curricula. Broad outlines for
changes in college curricula have been discussed and agreed between the
Government and the Bank.

Procurement
50.       Civil works and procurement of furniture and equipment would be
grouped to the extent practicable to form attractive bid packages. Equipment
and furniture packages expected to cost more than $50,000 would be awarded on
the basis of international competitive bidding in accordance with the Bank's
Guidelines for Procurement. In bid comparison, qualified local manufacturers
would be given a preferential margin of 15Z on the c,i.f. cost of equipment
and furniture or the customs duty, whichever is lower. Because of the
relatively small size of the contracts ($100,000-200,000) and the scattered
nature of the construction sites, contracts for all civil works and for
equipment and furniture costing below $50,000 would be awarded on the basis
of competitive bidding pursuant to Government procedures which are acceptable
to the Bank. Foreign firms would be allowed to bid. In order to ensure
synchronized construction, bid packages would include project construction as
well as parallel expansion construction (classrooms and communal facilities)
for which the Government would use local competitive bidding. Instructional
materials and books produced outside Indonesia will be procured through
international shopping on the basis of at least three price quotations after
consultation with the Bank, and locally produced books will be procured on
the basis of competitive bidding acceptable to the Bank or, where appropriate,
purchased directly from publisherq after negotiations for bulk purchases.
Miscellaneous items, in packages each amounting to $10,000 and subject to an
aggregate total not exceeding $300,000 would be purchased off-the-shelf on
the basis of a minimum of three price quotations.
Disbursements
51.       The proceeds of the proposed loan would be disbursed for:
(a) 302 of the cost of civil works;
(b) 30% of total cost or 100% of the foreign costs of engineering
consultants;
(c) 1002 of the c.i.f. cost of imported equipment, books, materials and
furniture, 95% of the ex-factory cost of locally produced equipment,
books, materials and furniture, and 65% of the cost of equipment,
books, materials and furniture procured otherwise;
(d) 100l of the cost of expert services; and
(e) 100l of foreign and 30% of local costs of training and fellowships.
It is recommended that, in order to speed up project implementation, the
expenditures for engineering consultants, expert services and fellowships,
subject to a maximum of $300,000, incurred from November 1, 1976 be reimbursed
from the proposed loan retroactively. Disbursement is expected to be com-
pleted by December 31, 1982.

Benefits, Justification, and Risks
52.       The ultimate benefit of the project would be improved quality of
instruction in primary and secondary schools by means of better trained
teachers. Under the project the content and methods of teacher training
would be reformed and improved. Training programs would be adjusted to
correspond more closely with the skills required for classroom instruction.
Textbooks and teacher guides covering 40 subjects would be developed and
produced in the national language and distributed to a total of 200 teacher
training institutions. In-service training would be provided for about
7,000 teacher educators, or 60-80% of all teacher education staff. Physical
facilities provided by the project (libraries, laboratories, workshops and
demonstration rooms) would permit better academic preparation and especially
the acquisition of better teaching methods. Between 1980 and 1985 it is
expected that about 80,000 primary and 23,000 secondary teachers would have
graduated from teacher education institutions involved in all aspects of the
project. These teachers would in 1985 educate about 2.8 and 0.5 million
students at primary and secondary levels, respectively. It is reasonable to
expect that the project, together with other improvements envisioned by the
Government, would make it possible to achieve targets for primary and secon-
dary school student achievement substantially above current levels. In
addition, the project would support the Government's program to rationalize
its system of primary teacher training Institutes reducing the total number
from 205 to 126 and increasing average enrollment from 270 to 800 in 1984,
thereby improving quality and reducing unit costs. As most trainees are
female the Government's expansion program would also increase employment
opportunities for women. The proposed project would also contribute to the
Government's program of capacity expansion by about 7,000 teacher training
places (about 15% of the number of places needed).
53.       Risks.  The activities of this project involve an unusual degree of
interdependence, span a wide geographical area and depend on action at various
levels of Government administration. Therefore, effective coordination and
management are especially important to the attainment of project objectives.
The project takes these requirements into account by: (a) formation of a
board of directors to develop and supervise project operation; (b) careful
recruitment and training of a National Team to lead each project activity;
(c) establishment of a fully staffed project management unit; (d) provision of
technical assistance for project management support; and (e) specific arrange-
ments for reassessment of the implementation schedule after an initial trial
phase.
54.       Successful implementation also depends on coordination of the
project with parallel activities being undertaken by the Government, particu-
larly its planned construction program to expand enrollments at project
teacher training institutes. Since this parallel construction is essential
for effective utilization of the project facilities, Joint budgeting, archi-
tectural design and tendering of the project, and parallel construction have
been agreed upon with the Government.
55.       Factors outside the direct purview of the project, such as low
prestige for teacher training institutions, multiple jobs for teachers and



- 17 -
inefficient deployment of teachers (short school days), are major obstacles
to improvement in the quality of instruction. There is little the project
can do to affect these problems directly or quickly. However, the proposed
project would include a systematic evaluation by the Government of its
policies on teacher salaries, deployment and working conditions.
56.       The ultimate benefit of the project, better student learning, would
depend on whether and how well the graduates of project institutions apply
improved teaching methods in the classroom. This would require teachers to
change traditional attitudes and behavior about the content and methods of
teaching. The project includes a monitoring system which would facilitate
assessments of the use and effects of new methods in classrooms as a basis
for continuous adjustments in the curricula and methods of teacher training
by the project institutions.
57.       Despite the implementation risks and the above-mentioned general
obstacles to improvements in the quality of instruction, the project would be
able to make a significant impact on teaching skills and methods. The good
progress made by the Government in preparing the project for implementation
indicates a strong interest in, and commitment to, the project. Without the
changes in teacher training which the project would introduce, the objectives
of the new school curricula are unlikely to be met by the 180,000 new teachers
who would enter the system between 1980 and 1985 without proper preparation.
Their subsequent retraining would be costly and logistically and educationally
difficult. The project, therefore, affords a unique opportunity to achieve
broad improvements in the quality of teacher preparation.
PART V - LEGAL INSTRUMENTS AND AUTHORITY

C. PROJECTS IN EXECUTION /1
Cr. No. 155 Agricultural Estates: US$16 Million Credit of June 20,
1969; Effective Date: December 10, 1969; Closing Date:
December 31, 1976
The credit is fully committed.
Cr. No. 194 Second Agricultural Estates: US$17 Million Credit of
June 15, 1970; Effective Date: February 9, 1971;
Closing Date: June 30, 1977
Project progress is good in the oil palm group which has surpassed
the appraisal report target for new planting by 100%. Progress in the rubber
group has been unsatisfactory with only 50% of the appraisal report target
for new planting achieved. Planting costs are excessive and investment
planning weak. The project has suffered from management deficiencies and
shortage of funds for investment. The Minister of Agriculture has recently
made the necessary changes in management of the rubber group and the Govern-
ment is expected to review its financial policies, particularly with regard
to dividends.
Cr. No. 195 Second Irrigation Rehabilitation: US$18.5 Million Credit
of June 15, 1970; Effective Date: December 31, 1970;
Closing Date: November 30, 1977.
Progress has been delayed first by initial difficulties in equipment
procurement and civil works execution, and later, by rising construction costs.
Project completion will therefore be about 2-1/2 years behind schedule. The
rehabilitated and new facilities are technically sound and hydraulically
adequate. The quality of maintenance of completed works is improving with
the availability of operation and maintenance funds substantially higher than
previous levels. The credit is about 96% disbursed and the remaining funds
will finance all outstanding civil works. The estimated project cost has
more than doubled since appraisal due to high inflation rates and increases in
contract quantities, but the estimated economic rate of return remains satis-
factory because rice prices and yields have been higher than those projected
during appraisal.
/1 These notes are designed to inform the Executive Directors regarding
the progress of projects in execution, and in particular to report
any problems which are being encountered, and the action being taken
to remedy them. They should be read in this sense, and with the under-
standing that they do not purport to present a balanced evaluation of
strengths and weaknesses in project execution.

Cr. No. 220 Third Irrigation Rehabilitation: US$14.5 Million Credit
of November 6, 1970; Effective Date: May 28, 1971;
Closing Date: December 31, 1977.
Overall project completion is expected by October 1977, about two
years behind schedule. The problems which caused this delay - difficulties
in preparation of contract documents, late financial allocations, heavy
rains in the 1973 construction season and, more recently high inflation rates
and consequent civil works cost overruns - have been mainly overcome, but
time lost cannot be regained. The quality of maintenance of completed works
is improving with the availability of operation and maintenance funds sub-
stantially higher than previous levels. The estimated project cost is about
twice the appraisal estimate, but rice prices and yields substantially higher
than those projected at appraisal enable the project to achieve an estimated
economic rate of return of over 20%.
Cr. No. 246 Seeds: US$7.5 Million Credit of May 19, 1971;
Effective Date: December 7, 1971; Closing Date:
September 30, 1977.
Construction of the irrigation infrastructure and the seeds proces-
sing plant has been completed satisfactorily. Land development at Sukamandi
will be limited to about 1,600 ha (65% of appraisal estimates) by the Closing
Date to enable the project authorities to consolidate production and other
operations. Significant results for 1976/77 are expected to be: (a) area
under production - 1,800 ha (58% of the appraisal estimate), (b) yields of
rice seed - 3.5 tons per ha (87%), and (c) production of certified seed -
4,900 tons (42%). Due mainly to the delay in the development of irrigation
infrastructure, and partly to overly optimistic assumptions during appraisal,
the targets for per ha yield and certified seed production will not be
achieved by September 1977. Due to cost escalation and implementation
difficulties, only one seed multiplication district, out of the three planned
at appraisal, has been developed. Based on present levels of production the
National Seeds Corporation (NSC) is not commercially viable and will need
continued financial support from the Government. The future of the project
and of NSC depend on Government policy for the further development of the
seed industry.
Cr. No. 259 Tea: US$15 Million Credit of June 24, 1971; Effective
Date: September 17, 1971; Closing Date: June 30, 1978.
Agricultural achievements to date have far exceeded appraisal expec-
tations necessitating construction and rehabilitation of three additional
factories. Project completion, estimated for December 1977, can probably be
advanced. Rising costs are creating pressure on available funds and the main
challenge for the two PTPs will be to reduce working capital requirements,
as well as overlhead and indirect costs, and improve labor productivity.

Cr. No. 260 Second Highway: US$34 Million Credit of June 24, 1971;
Effective Date: August 10, 1971; Closing Date:
December 31,1978.
Quality of work is satisfactory and cost overruns have been relatively
small despite sharp price increases due to efforts to reduce construction
quantities, and to cost savings for consulting services. Construction work
is completed; however, postponement of the Closing Date to December 31, 1978
has been agreed to permit payments for the completion of detailed engineering
of the Padang-Medan Road, the initiation of which was delayed to reconsider
road design standards in relation to those recently developed for the highway
betterment program and to take into account IDA's recommendations regarding
standards for urban portions of the road.
Cr. No. 288 Second Education: US$6.3 Million Credit of March 9,
1972; Effective Date: June 7, 1972;
Closing Date: March 30, 1978.
The project is about 12 months behind schedule because of late
appointment of consultant architects and lack of funds to meet cost overruns.
The main causes of delay have been overcome and significant progress is being
made. All civil works are expected to be completed by September 1977. Furni-
ture and equipment are being delivered. The expert services are virtually
completed. Progress of the fellowship program and teacher training is satis-
factory. The Government has made budgetary provisions to meet the cost
overruns. Disbursements have improved. Delayed implementation required
postponement of the Closing Date by 15 months to March 30, 1978.
Cr. No. 289 Fourth Irrigation Rehabilitation: US$12.5 Million Credit
of March 9, 1972; Effective Date: May 5, 1972; Closing
Date: June 30, 1977.
The construction program has escalated in cost by 190% over the
appraisal estimate due to an increase in the magnitude of the works and price
escalation due to unexpected inflation. The bulk of the remaining work will
be accomplished largely with Government funds. Completion of the project is
expected by September 1978. The Government has therefore, requested that the
Closing Date be postponed to December 31, 1978. Feasibility studies
included in the project have been completed and groundwater investigations
are nearing completion.
Cr. No. 300 Population: US$13.2 Million Credit of April 20, 1972;
Effective Date: November 2, 1972; Closing Date: June 30, 1978
The national family planning program, of which the project is an
integral part, is expanding in terms of the numbers of new acceptors recruited
annually and now covers about 15% of all married women in the reproductive
age group. Implementation of the civil works component is now on schedule;
because of the shift in strategy from static to mobile services, and because
of a large scale Government-financed program to construct and rehabilitate



ANNEX II
Page 7
Maternal and Child Health/Family Planning centers, the Government has
requested a reduction in the number of centers to be constructed under the
project, to which IDA and the United Nations Fund for Population Activities
(as partners in jointly financing the project) have agreed.
Cr. No. 310 Development Finance Co.''(BAPINDO I): US$10 Million Credit
of June 7,'1972;'Effective Date:   August 10, 1972;
Closing Date: August 31, 1977.
Prior to the original Closing Date which was December 31, 1976,
about $700,000 remained undisbursed and the Closing Date has been postponed to
August 31, 1977 to allow time for BAPINDO to submit documents for reimbursement.
Cr. No. 318 Inter-Island Fleet Rehabilitation: US$8.5 Million
Credit of June 28, 1972; Effective Date: October 19,
1972; Closing Date:. September 30, 1978.
At the request of the Government the Closing Date has been post-
poned to September 30, 1978 in order to provide for several new projects of
ship rehabilitation.. It is expected that the Credit will be fully disbursed
by the new Closing-Date but that, due to sharply increased costs, just over
half the tonnage of shipping expected at appraisal will have been rehabili-
tated.
Cr. No. 319 Fourth Agricultural Estates: US$11 Million Credit of
June 28, 1972; Effective Date: January 30, 1973;
Closing Date: June 30, 1981.
Physical progress of the project which is being executed by PNP X,
a Government-owned estate group, continues to be satisfactory, with plantings
of rubber and oil palm.ahead of appraisal estimates and in excellent condition.
Coffee is a promising -crop, and cloves planted in 1974 are growing well. A
hybrid coconut seed garden has been established, the first in Indonesia. PNP X
management needs to pay more attention to cost control and financial planning.
Substantial cost increases have taken place largely due to an expansion in the
size of the program compared with appraisal estimates.    The Government has
agreed to provide part of the shortfall,in project funding and discussions
with the Government are proceeding on a proposed increase in the budgetary
allocation. PNP X is participating in the execution of smallholder develop-
ment under the Transmigration and Rural Development Project (Loan 1318-IND)
and the proposed Nucleus,Estates and Smallholders Project.
Cr. No. 334 Second Electricity Distribution: US$40 Million Credit
of September 29, 1972; Effective Date: March 12, 1973;
* Closing!Date.' December'31, 1977.
The Jakarta distribution program financed from Credits 165-IND and
334-IND (together $55,.million). encountered implementation delays due to procure-
ment problems and cumbersome management procedures. As a result the project is



ANNEX II
Page 8
two years behind the original schedule. These difficulties have been resolved
and recent progress is encouraging and no further delays are expected. The
Closing Date has been postponed from December 31, 1976 to December 31, 1977.
Cr. No. 355 Beef Cattle Development: US$3.6 Million Credit of
January 31, 1973; Effective Date: May 30, 1973;
Closing Date: March 31, 1980.
Several problems have seriously delayed project implementation.
Government's budget allocation has been insufficient, and financial manage-
ment and coordination have been weak. The last supervision mission undertook
a thorough project review and its recommendations, which include major changes
in project scope and objectives, are being prepared for consideration by the
Executive Directors.
Cr. No. 358 North Sumatera Smallholder Development: US$5 million Credit of
February 14, 1973; Effective Date: August 13, 1973;
Closing Date: December 31. 1981
The project's goals of oil palm and rubber plantings by smallholder
participants should be completed by the end of 1977 at the present rate of
progress, which is now ahead of schedule. Costs of the project have increased
from $10 million estimated at appraisal to about $26 million by completion
date. However, higher than anticipated output of and prices for rubber and
palm oil and changes in project development techniques have more than compen-
sated the cost increases, and the project's return to the economy is likely
to be higher than anticipated at appraisal. No effective mechanism for the
credit-assisted portion of the project has yet been developed.
Cr. No. 387 Third Education: US$13.5 Million Credit of June 1, 1973;
Effective Date: August 29, 1973; Closing Date: December 31, 1981
The project finances the production and distribution of 138 million
primary school textbooks, and related in-service training for 350,000 primary
school teachers. Distribution of the first 31 million textbooks has been
completed and they are beginning to be used in schools this year. Production
of 49 million textbooks scheduled for 1976 is well under way. Book delivery
has been improved and teaching equipment has been procured and delivered.
Teacher training continues to proceed on schedule. Project management has
been strengthened by addition of Indonesian staff to a reorganized project
unit, and by recruitment of specialists under a technical assistance contract
signed with UNESCO.
Cr. No. 388 Third Highway: US$14 Million Credit of June 1. 1973;
Effective Date: June 25. 1973; Closing Date: June 30, 1977.
Construction work on the two North Sulawesi road sections included

and extra amounts of unforeseen work. The project is 50% complete and the
Closing Date will probably have to be postponed by one year. Project costs
are likely to exceed original estimates by 80% mainly due to sharply escalated
prices. As a consequence, the disbursement rate for construction is now in
the process of being lowered. The training program has been successfully
completed. Feasibility studies and detailed engineering for the road bet-
terment program are nearing satisfactory completion.
Cr. No. 399 West Java Thermal Power: US$46 Million Credit of
June 22, 1973; Effective Date: August 28, 1973;
Closing Date: June 30, 1978.
Bids received for the first two 100 MW units at Muara Karang were
about 65% higher than estimated at the time of appraisal. This, together
with construction cost increases, has resulted in an increase in the total
project cost of more than 100%. Government will provide the additional funds
required. PLN has satisfactorily met the initial targets in its financial
recovery plan provided for under the terms of the Credit Agreement.
Cr. No. 400 Smallholder and Private Estate Tea: US$7.8 million Credit of
June 22, 1973; Effective Date: November 30, 1973;
Closing Date: March 31, 1982.
Fewer than anticipated credit applications have necessitated scaling
down project targets from 10,000 ha to about 6,000 ha for smallholder tea and
from 3,500 ha to 2,300 ha for estates tea. The demand by farmers for technical
assistance has been encouraging.   Over 3,000 farmers have been instructed in
tea cultivation at village level courses and at the Project Management Unit
(PMU) training center.  The project spin-off has been excellent; about 2,000 ha
of tea were replanted or rehabilitated using funds outside the credit program
but still under the influence of the PMU. A marketing study indicates that
tea consumption in Indonesia increases by 5X yearly and all of the tea produced
by the project will be consumed domestically. Tea prices at farm level are
well above appraisal estimates which is part of the reason why farmers have
been reluctant to apply for long-term credit.
Cr. No. 405 Sugar Industry Rehabilitation: US$50 Million Credit of
June 26, 1973; Effective Date: April 22, 1974;
Closing Date:  June 30, 1979.
The scope of the project has been reduced by the deletion of six
minor rehabilitations from the project description due to cost overruns.
The revised-project consists of the major rehabilitation of two factories
and the construction of a new factory together with associated agricultural
development, sugar research and technical assistance components. Due to
late project start-up and delays in arranging consultancy services, project
completion will be delayed by one year. Factory construction and rehabili-
tation is progressing satisfactorily.

Cr. No. 428 Pulo Gadung Industrial Estate: US$16.5 Million Credit
of September 14, 1973; Effective Date: November 13,
1973; Closing Date: December 31, 1978.
The estate is developing satisfactorily. Of 430 ha earmarked for
the project, about 270 ha had been acquired by September 1976, and 128 ha had
been developed for occupation. Seventy-four factories are located on the
estate of which 37 are operating and 37 are in various stages of construction
or commission. Factory employment is 16,275 and an estimated 1,400 are
employed on average in both factory construction and land development.
Overall, operations are profitable.
Cr. No. 436 Private Development Finance Company of Indonesia
(PDFCI): US$10 Million Credit of November 2, 1973;
Effective Date: March 6. 1974; Closing Date:
December 31, 1978.
Despite a long start-up period and difficulties in recruiting
qualified staff, the project has progressed satisfactorily. The Credit is
almost fully committed.
Cr. No. 451 Fourth Technical Assistance: US$5 Million Credit of
January 2. 1974; Effective Date: February 15, 1974;
Closing Date: December 31, 1977.
Progress under the project is satisfactory.
Cr. No. 479 Bali Tourism: US$16.0 Million Credit of June 14, 1974;
Effective Date: December 4, 1974; Closing Date:
August 31, 1979.
Project implementation has improved after initial difficulties.
The evaluations of project tenders have been approved by IDA. Infrastructure
construction started in July 1976 and completion is scheduled for October
1979. Budgetary allocations as requested by the Bali Tourism Development
Corporation for FY76/77 are satisfactory. Preliminary discussions with three
potential hotel investors are underway. Promotional efforts to attract addi-
tional investors and tourists have been intensified, and additional flights
from Sydney and Hong Kong to Bali have been approved by the Minister of
Communications and Tourism.
Cr. No. 480 Fisheries Credit: US$6.5 Million Credit of June 14, 1974;
Effective Date: January 8, 1975; Closing Date: June 30, 1979.
After some initial delays, the project as a whole has generally been
progressing satisfactorily. Construction of shore facilities at Ambon is



ANNEX II
Page 11
nearing completion. Boat construction is underway and the contract for equip-
ment has been awarded. The quality of lending for fishpond development needs
to be improved although lending for this component in terms of the number of
subborrowers and area covered had met targets envisaged during appraisal.
Bidding for ice plant construction should start soon. The justification for
the trawler subproject is being reviewed by the Government.
Cr. No. 514 Jatiluhur Irrigation Extension: US$30 Million Credit
of October 3, 1974; Effective Date: January 10, 1975;
Closing Date: December 31, 1980.
Initial organizational difficulties and a delay in awarding the
first construction contract caused a delay of about 18 months in the project
schedule. The first construction contract was awarded in February 1977, the
next four are scheduled for November 1977, and the last two for May 1978.
From a revision of bid prices for the first contract, the total cost of civil
works is now estimated to be about 40% higher than at the time of the last
review of project progress. The total project cost has increased about 130%
since appraisal in May 1974.
Loan No. 1005 Railway: US$48.0 Million Loan of June 14, 1974;
Effective Date: August 16, 1974; Closing Date:
December 31, 1978.
Procurement of material and equipment, which had been slow due to
poor organization and inadequate budget allocation, has now improved. The
bulk of the contracts have been signed. Passenger traffic in 1975 was
slightly lower than in 1974, but still higher than forecast; freight traffic
has continued to decline due mainly to poor maintenance and inadequate motive
power. Efforts are being made to strengthen the effectiveness of the technical
assistance program and to more closely monitor project developments. Although
tariffs were raised in May 1975, increasing passenger revenues by about 25%
and freight revenues by about 10%, the operating ratio is likely to deteriorate
further, as operating costs have continued to rise at an even faster rate.
Loan No. 1040 Jakarta Urban Development: US$25 Million Loan of
September 27, 1974; Effective Date: January 15, 1975;
Closing Date: December 31, 1977.
The kampung improvement part of the project is substantially
complete. Some 2,080 lha have been upgraded as compared with the original
plan of 1,980 ha. The sites and services component is about 15 months behind
schedule. This is primarily due to land acquisition problems encountered in
the early stages of the project. Project costs are expected to be about 7%
above the appraisal estimate. The allocation of plots and core houses is
expected to begin in July. Some problems have arisen with regard to the
procedures to be utilized in allocating the plots, and these are being
reviewed currently by the Government.

Loan No. 1049 Five Cities Water Supply: US$14c5 Million Loan of
October 31, 1974; Effective Date: May 21, 1975;
Closing Date: June 30, 1980.
Due to administrative and managerial problems the project is
running 13-18 months behind schedule. This delay together with higher rates
of inflation than anticipated is expected to increase project costs 25-30%
above the appraisal estimate. Detailed engineering and preparation of tender
documents have been completed and the project has reached its construction
phase. The reorganization of the Directorate of Sanitary Engineering and the
establishment and development of local water enterprises are proceeding
satisfactorily.
Loan No. 1054 Development Finance Co. (BAPINDO II): US$50 Million
Loan of November 20, 1974; Effective Date: January 14,
1975; Closing Date: December 31, 1978.
The loan is expected to be fully committed in the second quarter of
1977. Despite significant institutional improvements achieved by BAPINDO,
the company has still a high level of arrears; its appraisal work is slow and
administrative costs are excessive. These problems are being addressed
through a Program of Action discussed and agreed between the Government,
BAPINDO and the Bank.
Loan No. 1089 Second Fertilizer Expansion: US$115 Million Loan of
February 28, 1975; Effective Date: April 29, 1975;
Closing Date: August 31, 1978.
The Project (PUSRI III) was mechanically completed in December 1976,
one month ahead of schedule. As there was a slight delay in the completion
of the related gas project, the gas requirement of PUSRI III for start-up
during November 15, 1976 - January 7, 1977 was met by advancing the scheduled
shutdown of PUSRI II for annual maintenance by two months.    Meanwhile, the
PUSRI III gas system has been completed. Total cost of PUSRI III is expected
to be within the appraisal estimate.
Loan No. 1100   Sixth Irrigation:  US$65 Million Loan of April 10,
1975; Effective Date: June 20, 1975; Closing Date:
June 30, 1982.
Most of the project programs have advanced well during the first
year of operation. Design of works for the Cirebon and Rentang subproject
systems are beyond the capability of PROSIDA to execute, and assistance will
be provided in Irrigation VIII to expedite this work. Critical review of the
program for benefit monitoring is underway.

Loan No. 1127 Fourth Power: US$41 Million Loan of June 17, 1975;
Effective Date: October 23, 1975; Closing Date:
June 30, 1980.
The project provides for the expansion of the Muara Karang thermal
power station at Jakarta by addition of a third 100 MW generating unit. The
general construction contracts covering this unit as well as the first two
financed under Credit 399-IND have been awarded. The project is on schedule
and expected to be completed in early 1980.
Loan No. 1139 Fertilizer Distribution: US$68 Million Loan of
July 10, 1975; Effective Date: August 28, 1975;
Closing Date: December 31, 1979.
All the contracts for the original project have been let and most
materials and three ships have been delivered to Indonesia. Savings of about
$30 million were realized in the original project. Procurement of an
additional ship and bulk reception facilities to serve expansion of fertilizer
output beyond that anticipated at appraisal was approved by the Executive
Directors on April 5, 1977. The expanded project is underway and is likely
to be completed successfully by the revised Closing Date, postponed by one
year.
Loan No. 1179 Agricultural Research and Extension: US$21.5 Million Loan
of December 19, 1975; Effective Date: February 23, 1976;
Closing Date: December 31, 1981.
Project implementation is one year behind schedule due to problems
in the appointment of executive architects for detailed design and supervision
of construction of the research centers and of the consultant firm which will
provide research and extension specialists. However, the pace of implementa-
tion has recently improved; the contract for research and extension services
was signed in February 1977 and negotiations with the architects are in
progress.
Loan No. 1197 National Resource Survey and Mapping Project: US$13.0
Million Loan of February 5, 1976; Effective Date: April 2,
1976; Closing Date: December 31, 1981.
The project agency, BAKOS'URTANAL, has made considerable progress
since the Loan was signed. Several senior staff required for administration
and project procurement have been appointed and preliminary designs for
project facilities have been conpleted. Preparation of equipment specifica-
tions and planning of aerial photography operations to support detailed
resource surveys of the southern Sumatera region are also proceeding.

Effective Date:  August 13, 1976; Closing Date:    December 31.
1980.
Contracts have been signed or awarded for the construction of the
first package of roads totalling 585 km and for nine consultancy assignments.
Progress is about six to nine months behind the initial project implementa-
tion schedule, mainly due to the unforeseen bunching of many activities
(negotiations for the consultancy assignments, prequalification of contrac-
tors, tendering, etc.) and a general shortage of staff to deal with the
rapidly increasing work load.
Loan No. 1237 Fourth Education Project: US$37 Million Loan of April 15,
1976; Effective Date: June 17, 1976; Closing Date:
December 31, 1980.
Project implementation units have been established and the team
leaders for technical assistance are in place. Contracts with the consultant
architects have been signed. Site selection and acquisition are generally
satisfactory with some exceptions due to difficult site conditions and higher
site costs. The project is about 10 months behind schedule due to initial
delay in the appointment of consultant architects and signing of agreements
with UN agencies for technical assistance. The problems causing delays are
being followed up with the Government agencies concerned.
Loan No. 1250 Second Shipping Project: US$54 Million Loan of May 20, 1976;
Effective Date: October 8, 1976; Closing Date:
December 31, 1980.
The appointment of a number of consultants has been delayed which
could cause a lag in the implementation of the project. The financial
position of the state shipping company (PELNI) is unsatisfactory, which may
result in financial problems for the project entity (PANN). The Government
is aware of this potential problem and is considering steps to deal with it.
The project is being closely followed.
Loan No. 1254 Third Fertilizer Expansion Project: US$70 Million Loan of
May 20, 1976; Effective Date: August 15, 1976; Closing Date:
June 30, 1979.
The Project (PUSRI IV), which is designed to have an annual cap-
acity of 570,000 tons of urea, is about four months ahead of schedule,
but the related gas project is experiencing some delay. Efforts are being
made by the Government to accelerate the gas project. According to present
indications, PUSRI IV is likely to be commissioned in mid-October 1977. No
cost overrun is foreseen for this project.
