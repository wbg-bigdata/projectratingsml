FOURTH EDUCATION PROJECT
CREDIT AND PROJECT SUMMARY
Borrower:         Republic of Malawi
Beneficiary:      Ministry of Education
Amount:            SDR 32.2 million (US$41.0 million equivalent)
Terms:             Standard
Project            The proposed project would assist Malawi in improving
Description:    and expanding secondary education and the training of
secondary schoolteachers. In addition, it would assist
the Government in the preparation of a national education
plan to provide the basis for future development of the
education system. Specifi~cally, the five-year project would
finance: (a) construction, furnishing and equipping of five
new and the expansion of six existing secondary schools;
(b) construction, furnishing and equipping of additional
boarding and teaching facilities for Chancellor College at
Zomba; and (c) preinvestment studies and technical assistance
for preparation of a national education plan. As a result
of the project, both enrollment and output of secondary
and higher education would increase by about 5 percent per
annum thereby providing much needed manpower for middle-
and higher-level positions. Relatedly, the project would
contribute to expanded educational and employment opportu-
nities for women. It would also lead to improved analysis,
planning and management of Malawi's education system.
There are no major risks to the project except a possible
shortage of secondary schoolteachers. Steps have been
taken to minimize that risk.

INTERNATIONAL DEVELOPMIENT ASSOCIATION
REPORT AND RECOMMENDATIONS OF THE PRESIDENT
TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS ON A PROPOSED CREDIT
TO THE REPUBLIC OF MALAWI
FOR A FOURTH EDUCATION PROJECT
1.        I submit the following report and recommendation on a proposed
credit to the Republic of Malawi of SDR 32.2 million (approximately US$41.0
equivalent) on standard IDA terms for a Fourth Education Project.
PART I - THE ECONOMY
2.        A report entitled "Memorandum on the Economy of Malawi" (Report
No. 1677a-MAI) dated September 30, 1977, was circulated to the Executive
Directors on October 10, 1977. A Basic Economic Mission visited Malawi
from May 11, 1979 to June 15, 1979 and the report is currently under prepara-
tion.
3.        With a population of 5.7 million (1978) and an area of about
118,500 sq km, Malawi is relatively densely populated. Its main assets
are moderately fertile soils, good water resources and a climate favorable
to crop production. Unlike its neighbors, Malawi has no known substantial
mineral resources. Being landlocked, it has to depend on other countries
for access to the sea.
4.        Although Malawi has a GNP per capita of only US$200 and has been
identified by the United Nations as one of the world's poorest countries,
its progress since independence, measured against its natural resources, has
been significant. GDP at constant prices grew at an average annual rate of 6
percent between 1964 and 1979. During the same period, real growth of estate
agriculture and manufacturing exceeded 10 percent per annum and export volume
grew at 4.5 percent per annum. A steadily increasing investment rate (rising
from 9 percent of GDP at independence to 22 percent in 1979) has been sup-
ported-by heavy inflows of foreign private and public capital as well as
by a significant increase in domestic savings (from virtually nil in 1964
to 14 percent of GDP in 1979).
5.        Malawi's success in its development efforts has been due in large
part to realistic and purposeful planning by the Government. The country's
long-term development policies for the period 1971-80 were outlined in the
"Statement of Development Policies 1971-80" (DEVPOL) which set out the
basic priorities for economic development. The Government is now in the
process of replacing DEVPOL with a five-year investment program beginning
in 1981/82.



- 2 -
6.        As stated in DEVPOL, public investment has been intended primarily
to support private efforts in the directly productive sectors through provi-
sion of essential infrastructure, public utilities and supporting services.
In addition, the Government has attached high priority to investments that
assist smallholder agriculture, as 90 percent of the population lives in
the rural areas and depends on agriculture for its livelihood. To this
end, the Government has undertaken a number of integrated rural development
projects in the past, and recently embarked on the National Rural Development
Program, an ambitious 20-year program designed eventually to extend agricul-
tural services to smallholders countrywide. The Government's decision to
emphasize directly productive sectors and related economic infrastructure,
coupled with limited amounts of financial and human resources, has resulted
in slower development of the social services such as health and education.
7.        The Government is in the process of finalizing its five-year public
sector investment program, FY82-86. Its priorities for the sectoral allocation
of resources are: 22 percent of total public investment expenditure for agri-
culture, 35 percent for transport, 10 percent for education, 11 percent for
water and health, and 22 percent for other miscellaneous investments. These
sectoral allocations reflect the Government's continued emphasis on smallholder
development and transport and the increased importance it now attaches to
manpower development.
8.        In 1977, a population census revealed that the country's population
grew at 2.9 percent per annum during the past decade. Projecting the same
growth rate for the remainder of the century, HIalawi's population would almost
double by the year 2000. This high population growth rate has important
implications for the labor/land ratio. Malawi's population density, about
140 per sq km of agricultural land, already is among the highest in Africa,
and by the year 2000, will rise to 265 people per sq km. Over 35 percent
of total land area is classified as suitable for cultivation and the available
arable land area is almost fully utilized. The implications of Malawi's
rapid population growth have been discussed with the Government which, at
this time, opposes active population control measures. The Basic Economic
Report is further analyzing these implications particularly in terms of the
cost of social services for a rapidly growing population and the Government's
land-use policy. Only about 9 percent of the total population lives in urban
areas. However, with the diversification of the economy, urban population is
increasing by more than 7 percent per annum, in line with the expansion of
wage employment opportunities in the non-agricultural sectors. The population
growth issue will be pursued in discussions with the Government of the findings
and recommendations of the Basic Economic Report and, as appropriate, through
the Bank's sector work and lending.
9.        Notwithstanding Malawi's impressive economic performance over the
past 15 years, its economy, heavily dependent on two primary commodity exports
(tea and tobacco), has remained highly vulnerable to international price
fluctuations. Since 1974, the country has experienced periodic balance of
payments disequilibria of increasing severity due primarily to (a) rapid
escalation in import prices, particularly of fuel and intermediate and capital



- 3 -
goods; (b) cyclical swings in export prices of tobacco and tea; and (c) sig-
nificantly higher costs of transport for both exports and imports owing to
rising ocean freight charges, port congestion in Beira and Nacala, and dis-
ruptions of overland transport.
10.       While the Government successfully steered the economy through
balance of payments crises in the past, the deterioration in the balance of
payments since 1978 has been les:3 manageable, primarily due to a 20 percent
fall in the terms of trade between 1977 and 1979 when export prices fell
5 percent (due mainly to declineE3 in tea and tobacco prices) and import
prices rose about 15 percent.  The petroleum import bill doubled from US$21
million in 1977 to an estimated IJS$38 million in 1979. The growing trade
deficit was exacerbated by a doubling of the negative balance for non-factor
services, due mainly to rising transport costs. In 1978 and 1979, Malawi's
current account deficit reached L2 and 15 percent of GUP in contrast to the
7-8 percent average experienced since independence. Because capital inflows
have not been sufficient to cover the current account deficits, Malawi has
also experienced a sharp drop in foreign exchange reserves. Between end-1977
and end-1979, gross official reserves fell from MK 76 million to MK 51 mil-
lion (from the equivalent of four months to one and a half months of imports).
Over the same period, net official reserves fell from MK 37 million to minus
MK 29 million. In the first half of 1980, the country's external position
deteriorated further, owing to a shortfall in the 1979/80 season's maize
crop, which has led to emergency grain imports and a sharp drop in the
average auction price of flue-cured tobacco which constitutes a large part
of Malawi's tobacco crop.
11.        In the past, the Government has approached the energy problem
through its pricing and tax policies to restrain demand and through invest-
ments aimed at identifying and developing new sources. Oil imports have been
subject to tariffs at 30 to 60 Fercent rates. The retail prices of gasoline
and diesel have been set at US$0.88 and US$0.80 per liter, respectively, while
their equivalent import prices are US$0.48 and US$0.45. In connection with
fuelwood, which represents some 80 percent of the country's domestic energy
consumption, the Government has undertaken to increase wood prices gradually
to levels which reflect production costs. The Government has also launched
projects in wood energy and ethanol production. At the Government's request,
the Bank plans to conduct an energy sector study that would survey the avail-
able resources, project future demand and supply, examine alternative sources
of energy and explore possibilities for intersectoral substitution.
12.       Malawi's fiscal position has also seriously deteriorated over
the past two years. From independence through FY78, government expenditures
and revenues expanded roughly in line with the increases in GDP; while
deficits grew larger, they still, did not exceed 7-8 percent of GDP. In
the past two years, expenditure growth has outstripped the increase in
revenues by more than 40 percent. The share of government deficits in GDP
averaged 10 percent during 1978 and 1979. With the increased deficits came
an increased reliance on domestic borrowing mainly from the monetary system,
and on foreign borrowing, partly on commercial terms. At the same time,
inflationary pressures grew and the balance of payments position deterio-
rated. Prices rose at an average rate of 10 percent per annum during 1978
and 1979.



- 4 -
13.       Faced with these problems, the Government in 1979 initiated a series
of short-term corrective measures which included a two and a half year stand-by
arrangement with the IMF amounting to US$32.9 million (SDR 26.3 million).
Malawi also obtained US$23.8 million (SDR 19.0 million) from the compensatory
financing facility and a US$7.1 million (SDR 5.7 million) loan from the Trust
Fund. Unfortunately, a drought and a complete stoppage of all overland ex-
ternal transport, owing to political unrest in Mozambique during November and
December 1979, forced termination of the stand-by arrangement as the Govern-
ment could not meet some of the performance criteria.
14.       A new two-year arrangement, drawing on the second to fourth tranches
for US$64.8 million (SDR 49.9 million), was approved in May 1980. The two-
year program, which coincides with Malawi's fiscal years 1981 and 1982, aims
at constraining demand and limiting the balance of payments current account
deficit to US$195 million in FY81 and US$169 million in FY82. The performance
criteria involved phased ceilings on total domestic credit and on net bank
credit to Government and a limit on government (or government-guaranteed)
external borrowing of 1 - 12 years maturity.
15.       After successfully negotiating the two-year IMF stand-by arrangement,
the Government in April 1980 formally requested Bank assistance for a struc-
tural adjustment loan. A reconnaissance mission in May made a preliminary
assessment of the economy and reviewed the corrective measures which the
Government had taken already or was intending to take. An appraisal mission
visited the country during August-September, 1980.
16.       Because of the Government's limited ability to mobilize resources,
the sizeable expansion of Malawi's development program over the past decade
has been largely assisted by increased public capital inflows. The net
contribution from foreign official sources to the financing of public invest-
ment increased from US$17 million in FY68 to about US$103 million in FY79,
of which US$23 million were grants. However, in contrast with earlier expe-
riences, over 35 percent of the FY79 capital flows were on commercial terms.
Such commercial borrowing will have a pronounced effect on future debt
servicing. The sources have also been gradually diversified. At independence,
Britain was virtually the only source. By 1979 the British contribution had
declined to less than 15 percent; multilateral sources, especially IDA,
provided about 45 percent, and a variety of bilateral sources, notably Canada,
the Federal Republic of Germany, and the United States, accounted for most of
the remainder.
17.       By the end of 1979, Malawi's external public debt totalled US$606
million, of which US$423 million had been disbursed. Debt service in 1979
amounted to US$25 million, equivalent to about 10 percent of exports of goods
and services. At the end of 1978, the Bank's and the combined IDA/Bank shares
in Malawi's disbursed debt were 4 percent and 32 percent, respectively, and
service on the Bank Group debt accounted for 7.1 percent of total debt service.
In 1985, the IDA/Bank share in total disbursed debt is projected to be 30
percent and the service on Bank Group debt to be 10 percent of the total
debt service. There has been considerable hardening of the average terms



- 5 -
of lending in the past few years; the average grant element of official
assistance fell from the 80 percent level of 1971-1975 to 48 percent in
1978 and 23 percent in 1979. On the basis of loans committed by the end of
1979 and on additional capital requirements for the period 1980-85, Malawi's
debt service ratio is projected to reach 23 percent in 1985 (as compared with
8 percent in 1978 and 10 percent in 1979). Despite being a poor country,
Malawi has been making all reasonable efforts to mobilize domestic resources
to fund both its private and public investments. The domestic share of
development expenditures amounted to 22 percent in 1979. However this share
is unlikely to rise in the near future, as the expansion of the Government s
investment program required to achieve a reasonable rate of economic growth
and the consequent need for recurrent expenditures for operations and main-
tenance will absorb the bulk of additional tax revenues. Foreign exchange
will remain a significant requirement in maintaining imports. Hence, external
financing will be called upon to cover a substantial portion of total project
cost, including some local financing.
PART II - BANK GROUP OPERATIONS IN MALAWI
18.       Over the past 15 years Malawi has received 21 IDA credits totalling
US$183.2 million and four Bank loans totalling US$29.2 million, of which two
were on Third Window terms. Of the total Bank Group assistance, US$98.2 mil-
lion (46 percent) was for agriculture, US$37.8 million (18 percent) for power
development, US$32.4 million (15 percent) for education, US$32 million (15
percent) for roads, US$3 millior. (1 percent) for a development finance comr
pany (INDEBANK) and the balance of US$9 million (5 percent) for water supply
and to finance feasibility studies for a pulp mill at Viphya. The first Bank
loan to Malawi was made on Third. Window terms in June 1976 and the first
standard Bank loan in April 1977. The most recent IDA credit, SDR 25.9 mil-
lion (US$33.0 million equivalent) for a fourth highway project to develop
the Northern Region was approvec on February 3, 1981 and is expected to become
effective in May 1981. IFC-s investments in Malawi consist of a loan of US$6
million made in 1976 for a textile mill, another of US$9.5 million for sugar
development in 1977, a US$0.6 million equity investment in INDEBANK in 1979,
and a US$2.0 million loan to Ma]awi Hotels Limited for tourism in 1979. A
US$262,000 equity investment ancl a loan of US$1.7 million for the production
of ethanol from molasses were approved on July 29, 1980. A summary statement
of Bank Group operations and not:es on the execution of ongoing projects are
provided in Annex II. Project implementation has been fully satisfactory.
19.       During the next five years, Bank Group assistance to Malawi will
continue to emphasize rural development and agriculture, education, water
supply and roads. The third phase of the National Rural Development Program
already has been appraised, and preparation of a second-phase water supply
project for Lilongwe and selected rural areas has begun. Lending for struc-
tural adjustment also is expected to figure prominently over the next three
years: preparation of the firsi: loan is well advanced. Possible investments
in energy, health and development finance companies also are being investigated.

PART III - THE EDUCATION SECTOR
Overview
20.       After independence in 1964, government education policy emphasized
supplying middle- and higher-level manpower for the immediate needs of the
economy. After 1972, however, due to slow growth in secondary school enroll-
ments, combined with rapid economic growth, outputs at both the secondary and
higher levels have fallen short of development needs. Consequently, Malawi
still relies heavily on expatriates in middle- and higher-level positions.
Only 25 percent of the population is literate and only four percent of school
age children are full time in secondary education, a figure among the lowest
in Africa.
Education System
21.       The formal education system consists of eight years of primary,
four years of secondary, and post secondary and university courses of various
durations. Currently, primary school enrollment is 59 percent of the 6-13 age
group; however only 17 percent of students entering the first grade complete
the full eight-year course. Girls make up 41 percent of total primary school
enrollment, but are mucil more likely than boys to dLrop out of the system and,
as a result, make up only 26 percent enrollment in grade 8. Traditionally,
physical construction of primary school facilities, as well as providing
textbooks, equipment and furniture, have been the responsibility of the
communities, with the Government providing teachers. However, with the rapid
growth in primary school enrollments of around 12 percent per annum in recent
years achieving an enrollment of about 59 percent of the age group in 1979/80,
the Government has begun taking a more active role. With assistance from IDA,
it has undertaken a school mapping study to help determine specific school
construction needs, and has started a program to provide a set of basic
textbooks to all primary school students and help communities construct 1,000
primary school classrooms. The rapid expansion of primary school enrollments
has led to an increase in the student/teacher ratio which is now 62:1 compared
with the official policy of 50:1. Bank staff estimate that the annual output
of primary schoolteachers will need to increase from the present 700 per year
to over 1,300 per year by 1990, the combined output of a further three primary
teacher colleges. The Government, in planning to meet this need, intends
using internal funds to construct two training colleges and is seeking addi-
tional funds from bilateral and multilateral sources for a third teacher
training college to be located in Zomba. Starting in 1982, the Malawi Insti-
tute of Education is expected to initiate large scale in-service training
programs to upgrade qualified and unqualified teachers.
22.       Enrollment in secondary education increased from 3,100 in 1962 to
13,400 in 1972 but, since, has grown at an average annual rate of only three
percent reaching 16,500 in 1979. At present, almost half of the eighth grade
enrollment in primary education consists of children repeating the year with
the objectives of obtaining a higher score in the Primary School Leaving
Certificate (PSLC) and securing a place in secondary school. Because of a
shortage of secondary school graduates, primary teacher training colleges are



finding difficulty in recruiting qualified students for their courses. In
addition, the lack of secondary school graduates has resulted in major
shortages of middle- and higher-level manpower.
23.       Access to secondary education is based solely on PSLC examination
results. Selection is made nationally for students to attend the 22 govern-
ment boarding schools which have a combined enrollment of 5,600. Thereafter
students are selected by district to enter one of the 28 "district day"
schools which currently enroll 7,900 students, and most of which provide at
least some boarding facilities. In addition, students may attend one of 14
private, usually mission, schoolE enrolling 2,000 students. Overall, secondary
school places are available to only 14 percent of those passing the PSLC.
Girls are admitted with PSLC scores lower than those of boys but, because
of their high dropout rates in primary school, make up only 31 percent of
secondary school enrollment. A lower cost alternative to full-time secondary,
education -- the Malawi Correspondence College -- is expanding rapidly and in
1979 enrolled 4,800 students.
24.       The internal efficiency of secondary education is relatively high:
69 percent of students entering the system pass the Junior Certificate exami-
nation after two years and 56 pecent of those continuing pass the Malawi
Certificate of Examination given *at the end of the fourth year. The secondary
school curriculum emphasizes language, arts, science and mathematics. The
Malawi Institute of Education will be helping to improve teaching methods.
25.       The Ministry of Education (MOE) has recognized the need for a more
rapid expansion of secondary education to meet manpower requirements. How-
ever, because of teacher shortages and limited availability of capital, MOE
expects enrollment to increase by only about five percent per year from around
16,000 currently to about 28,000 in 1990. Considering the natural population
growth rate, the increase would only raise the percentage of children enrolled
in general secondary schools froni 3.4 percent to 4.5 percent, still among the
lowest in the world.
26.       Over 90 percent of the present 800 secondary school teachers are
qualified, expatriates constituting 25 percent of the total qualified.
Secondary teacher training is conducted at Chancellor College of the University
of Malawi. Following MOE's initiative, Chancellor College introduced crash
programs to boost the output and quality of teachers. A total of 155 new
students entered teaching programns in 1980. Based on a five percent annual
growth in secondary education, a 21:1 student/teacher ratio, and a gradual
reduction in expatriate teachers, the system will need 100 new teachers
per year by 1984 and 130 per year by 1989.
27.       In technical education, the Polytechnic and several secondary
technical and training schools offering programs in bricklaying, carpentry,
joinery, electricity, plumbing, Etc., are meeting the need for skilled

28.       Higher-level education, including training of engineers, business
managers, and technicians, is expanding. The Natural Resources College,
assisted by the Canadian International Development Agency, will provide
additional agricultural technicians by the mid-1980s.
29.       In non-formal education, several ministries and agencies sponsor
adult education programs and, while lack of coordination has often led to
duplication of efforts, they have reached a significant number of adults.
The Extension Aids Branch of the Ministry of Agriculture has been particularly
successful and its mobile units reach an estimated one million people per year.
30.       The Office of the President and Cabinet conducts training courses
for lower-level civil servants at Mpemba Staff Training College, and plans
to establish a new Institute of Public Administration for training and up-
grading administrative and development skills of those at the middle- and
senior levels.
31.       Total education expenditures are currently about 3.5 percent of
GDP. Recurrent expenditures on education as a percentage of total government
expenditure declined from about 17 percent in 1970/71 to 11.3 percent in
1979/80, proportions low by African standards, reflecting the relatively
greater emphasis on directly productive sectors, especially agriculture, and
on general administration. Assuming moderate growth in enrollment, improved
student/teacher ratios and continued upgrading of educational fac:ilities,
educational expenditures, as a percentage of the recurrent budget, should
increase to about 15 percent by 1985/86 and to 16 percent by 1990/91, a
level of expenditure that would not unduly tax 1Halawi's resources and would
still be lower than that of most African countries.
Government Objectives, Policy and Programs in the Sector
32.        The Government's basic objectives of education development are set
forth in the 1973-80 Education Plan in relation to the national development
goals stated in DEVPOL, 1971-80. The objectives are to improve the internal
efficiency of the education system by ensuring efficient utilization of
existing facilities and resources inputs, and to attain a more equitable
distribution of educational opportunities in addition to continued efforts to
provide the required manpower and to reorient the curricula. In the 1970s,
the Government has made considerable progress towards reaching these objectives
by: (a) improving the quality of primary education together with a quantita-
tive expansion; (b) introducing revised curricula at both the primary and
secondary levels; (c) embarking on a major expansion of primary teacher
training; and (d) expanding secondary education. The Bank-Group through its
first, second and third education projects has assisted the Government in
this regard (paras. 36-38).
33.       For the period FY82-86, the Government's public investment progr.am
assigns high priority to the education sector. The Government expects to
double its allocation of capital expenditures to education to 10 percent
of the capital development program. These capital expenditures would be
accompanied by corresponding increases in the recurrent budget which would
be regularly reviewed by the Government and the Association (para. 45).  Its



policy will be to continue to build on the achievements to date while further
strengthening the quality of its education system. Emphasis will continue
to be placed on primary and secorndary education and teacher training. Spe-
cifically, the Government intends;:
(a) expanding and improving general secondary education to
meet the needs of the economy, while continuing to provide
a low-cost alternative to secondary education by expanding
the Malawi Correspondence College;
(b)  expanding and strengthening the primary schools through
programs to provide textbooks and assistance to communities
for constructing schools on a self-help basis;
(c) expanding primary and secondary teacher training facilities
in line with projected teacher requirements;
(d)  increasing output of the University of Malawi, technical
and agricultural institutes to meet increasing demands
for professional and technical manpower; and
(e) developing curricula, improving teaching materials and
expanding in-service training programs for teachers at
Malawi Institute of Education.
This policy, though soundly conceived and realistic, is hampered by the
absence of an adequate national education plan for the 1980s and the need to
strengthen the Government's educational planning capabilities in the MOE and
the Economic Planning Division (EPD) of the Office of the President and
Cabinet. The project will address these needs through assisting in preparation
of a national education plan (paras. 34 and 45).
34.       Detailed surveys of the economy, the education sector, the status
of human capital and manpower needs over the past three years (para. 35)
underscore the significant difference between the numbers of secondary school
graduates produced and projected development needs. As a result, the Govern-
ment's highest priority in the sector is expanding secondary enrollment which
it plans to increase by about 5 percent per year or by 70 percent by 1990.
Even with the increase, there would still be an anticipated shortfall of
personnel with secondary education of about 9,000 by 1990. To help combat
the sh6rtage, the Government plans to prepare a national education plan to
increase the efficiency and quality of the education system while expanding
output. Specific programs in prLmary education focus on increasing the
supply of qualified teachers through expanding teacher training, upgrading
unqualified teachers through the Malawi Institute of Education, and improving
and increasing availability of textbooks and other materials. As community
initiatives form the basis for expanding enrollments through the construction
of classroom facilities, modifie,l self-help construction programs are being
strengthened by the Government anad will continue to be assisted by MOE
through the provision of materiaLs and technical assistance. Such programs
will be carried out within the framework of the recently completed school
location plan.

Bank Group Knowledge of and Assistance to the Education Sector
35.       The Bank Group has contributed to Malawi's knowledge of the educa-
tion sector as well as provided financial and technical support through its
projects. In 1978, Bank staff completed an in-depth Education Sector Survey
(Report No. 1781-MAI) and a report on the Status of Human Capital in Malawi in
May 1980. These studies have helped the Government pinpoint sectoral needs
and priorities as well as levels of new investment in primary and secondary
education. In addition, they have served to underscore that education is
a sound economic investment with a high rate of return, particularly for
secondary education. Last year Bank staff assisted the Government in analyzing
the results of the 1979 Malawi Manpower Survey, projecting future manpower
requirements through 1990 and delineating various policy options for the
education system. These studies, plus the experience gained from projects,
have helped to improve Malawi's analytical basis for developing its education
system.
36.       The First Education Project (Credit 102-MAI, signed in 1967) provided
US$6.3 million equivalent for introducing technical subjects in secondary
education, expanding secondary schools (about 1,800 additional places) and
constructing a new 540 place primary teacher training college. A Project
Performance Audit Report (No. 2914 dated March 25, 1980) indicated that the
project was on the whole successfully implemented and that it accomplished its
overall objectives of expanding enrollment in primary teacher training and
secondary education. However, the teaching of technical subjects was not as
successful as had been expected because of a lack of interest by students, a
shortage of teachers, and the provision of overly sophisticated equipment.
These issues have been fully discussed with the Government which, in the light
of experience, is no longer expanding the teaching of technical subjects in
general secondary schools, and is concentrating on the teaching of these
subjects in the specialized technical secondary schools.
37.       The Second Education Project (Credit 590-MAI, signed in 1975)
provides US$11.6 million for constructing a new 420 place teacher training
college in Mzuzu, for an additional 1,800 secondary school places, principally
for girls, and for 22 model primary schools designed to serve as prototypes
for community self-help construction and as centers of adult non-formal
education. The project is expected to be substantially completed by Mlarch 31,
1981 as estimated at appraisal. Most of the quantitative and qualitative
goals for primary teacher training and secondary education are being met. How-
ever, the primary schools are unlikely to be replicated by local communities
without significant technical and financial assistance from the Government
and, because of a slow response from other participating agencies and MOE's
lack of experience in non-formal education, are only slowly being used as
adult education centers. Programs in this field are, however, being developed
by the Ministry of Community Development, with assistance from UNICEF and MOE.
38.       The Third Education Project (IDA Credit 910-MAI and EEC Credit
12-MAI, for US$22.0 million, signed in 1979) focusses on primary education,
including providing the technical and financial support needed for self-help
construction of about 1,000 primary school classrooms and supplying about 2.2
million textbooks. It also supports improving management of education and



- 11 -
curriculum development, principally through establishing the Malawi Institute
of Education; expanding the Malawi Correspondence College; expanding Chancellor
College to produce more secondary schoolteachers; and studies and evaluation
of the education system that will be used in the preparation of the national
education plan (para. 45). Despite the project's relative complexity, the
highly competent Project Implementation Unit (PIU) is implementing it well
and on time.
Bank Group Stategy
39.       The Bank Group, througt. its economic and sector work and lending
for free-standing education projects, intends to continue supporting the
Government's programs to expand and improve primary and secondary education,
while assisting in strengthening its education planning and management
capabilities. Other priority areas are likely to include management and
teacher training. The proposed national education plan will serve as a
basis for determining Malawi's specific education needs for FY83-87 (para.
45).
PART IT - THE PROJECT
40.       The proposed project was identified in March 1979, and prepared by
the Government with assistance f:-om the World Bank Group. It was appraised
in May/June 1980, and negotiatiols were held in Washington, D.C., from
January 14-16, 1981. Mr. S. M. Kakhobwe, Secretary to the Treasury, led the
government delegation. A Staff Appraisal Report is being circulated sepa-
rately. Annex III provides supplementary project data.
Project Objectives and Description
41.       The proposed project would assist the Government in:  (a) expanding
and improving secondary education; (b) increasing the supply of secondary
schoolteachers and improving the quality of their training; (c) completing
plans for a primary teacher training college at Zomba and an Institute
of Public Administration in Lilongwe; and (d) developing a long-term national
education plan. The project would help the Government over a five-year
period (FY82-86)to reach these cbjectives by:
(i) constructing, furnishing and equipping five new and
expanding six existing secondary schools;
(ii) constructing, furnishing and equipping additional
boarding and faculty facilities for Chancellor College
at Zomba;
(iii) financing preinvestment studies; and
(iv) providing consulting services.

Detailed Features
(a) Secondary Education
42.       The project provides for constructing, furnishing and equipping
3,960 secondary school places, 3,842 dormitory places and 195 teacher houses.
It would construct five new 480 student schools and expand six existing
schools to 480 enrollment. More than half the new places in the six existing
schools would be for girls, and the total number of places for girls provided
under the project would be 1,849 (47 percent).
(b) Secondary Teacher Training
43.       The project would support constructing, furnishing and equipping
of teaching, boarding, and faculty housing facilities for an additional 168
students at Chancellor College. Additional academic facilities would emphasize
science and, with support from this and the third project, the College would
be able to expand enrollment to 1,000 and have adequate science and library
facilities for a further expansion to 1,200. The additional places provided
under these two projects would result in the enrollment of 500 students in
secondary teacher programs and, at full capacity, the College would achieve an
annual output of about 130 teachers by graduating each year: 55 teachers in
the three-year diploma programs, 55 in five-year degree courses and 20 in
two-year upgrading courses for diploma-level secondary schoolteachers. The
College has initiated a diploma-level program to upgrade primary teachers to
the secondary level and a new five-year degree program to train science
teachers, and is reviewing the length of the degree program, the content of
the program as a whole, including the relative mix of general and education
classes, and the incentives needed to attract future graduate teachers to
enter the profession.  Agreement was reached that the Government would in-
crease the annual output of secondary schoolteachers to around 100 a year by
1985; and about 130, by 1990. Starting in October 1981, and annually there-
after for a period of four consecutive years, the Government would prepare for
the Association-s review a report on its experience in implementing secondary
teacher training programs, describing recruitment of students, placement oi
graduates and plans for subsequent years, including estimates of expected
enrollment and outputs and proposed program or curriculum change!s. Further,
as required under the third project, the Government would undertake a tracer
study of Chancellor College graduates to determine how many enter the teaching
profession (Section 4.03 of the draft Credit Agreement.)
(c) Preinvestment Studies
44.       At the Government's request during appraisal, the Bank Grov.p evo,-
uated the Government s proposal for constructing an Institute of Public
Administration. Subsequently, the Bank Group submitted its comments and
recommendations to the Government which plans to finalize the proposal and
explore financing with other donors or the Bank Group in a future project.
The project provides funds for completing architectural design work for
the Institute in Lilongwe and a proposed primary teacher training college at
Zomba.



- 13 -
45.       The proposed project includes funds for assisting the Government to
prepare a national education plan guiding educational developments over the
next ten years. In addition to establishing operational priorities, the plan
would focus on institutional and policy changes and financial and manpower
requirements for improving the coverage, efficiency and effectiveness of
the entire education system. The plan would be based on selected studies
of the education system and on the estimated government resources available
to the education sector through 1990. The plan would have two major parts:
those aspects of education under the purview of MOE, and those under the
aegis of other government departments. EPD would coordinate preparation
of the overall plan, with the MOE Studies Coordinator (already provided
under UNDP assistance) preparing the first part and EPD, jointly with the
relevant departments, preparing the second. The Government has asked UNDP
to provide a human resources specialist for 24 months to assist EPD in carry-
ing out the plan and for overall human resource planning. Recruitment of the
specialist has begun and the position is expected to be filled by September 1,
1981. Draft terms of reference for the specialist were agreed and the Associa-
tion would review and comment on the qualifications and experience of the
candidate. Draft terms of reference for the national education plan were also
agreed, and the plan is expected to be completed by December 31, 1982.
About one year after Credit Signing and annually thereafter for four years,
the Government and the Association would review the education budget in terms
of its adequacy to carry out long-term educational objectives (Section 3.08
of the draft Credit Agreement).
Project Implementation
46.       The project would be administered by MOE which has overall adminis-
trative, financial and academic control of primary, secondary, technical
education, teacher training and 1he Malawi Correspondence College.  Day-to-day
project administration is the responsibility of PIU which was permanently
established under the second education project as an integral part of MOE,
located in the Planning Section and reporting directly to the Principal
Secretary. PIU not only supervises all aspects of Bank Group and African
Development Bank projects but oversees implementation of MOE's primary and
secondary school programs and the Bank Group-assisted components at Chancellor
College. PIU works closely with the Ministry of Works and Supplies to ensure
that all of its designs are of all acceptable, uniform national standard.
PIU is staffed by a Malawian Program Manager and Deputy, three architects
(supplied by the Danish International Development Agency and the British
Overseas Development Administration), four assistant architects, a pro-
curement officer, an accountant and two assistants. It has been functioning
efficiently and effectively and can handle the added responsibility of imple-
menting the proposed project. The project would finance .80 percent of PIU's
operating expenditures for project administration including salaries, vehicle
operating costs and incidental expenses. Agreement was reached that the
Government would keep PIU adequately staffed with personnel whose qualifi-
cations, experience, and terms and conditions of employment are satisfactory
to the Association (Section 3.02 of the draft Credit Agreement).



- 14 -
Project Cost and Financing
47.        Total project cost inclusive of taxes and duties is estimated
at US$53.8 million equivalent, of which US$22.7 million, or 42 percent
would be foreign costs. Details of project costs are included in the Credit
and Project Summary. The proposed Credit of SDR 32.2 million (around US$41.0
million equivalent) would finance 80 percent of project costs net of taxes,
100 percent (US$22.7 million) of foreign exchange and US$18.3 million of local
costs. The Government would provide the remaining US$12.8 million.
Procurement and Disbursement
48.        Contracts for civil works, furniture and equipment would be awarded
by international competitive bidding (ICB) in accordance with Bank Group
Guidelines, excepting construction contracts costing less than US$300,000
equivalent each and furniture and equipment contracts costing less than
US$100,000 equivalent each. Such contracts would be awarded following competi-
tive bidding advertised locally and in accordance with procedures acceptable
to the Bank Group; review of tender evaluation documents prior to award would
not be required. The aggregate total of such contracts is unlikely to exceed
US$1.0 milion equivalent including contingencies. Architectural sketch
designs and school layout proposals, draft tender documents and master lists
of furniture and equipment, including proposed grouping, have been reviewed
by the Bank Group and items have been grouped to encourage competitive bidding
and permit bulk procurement. Tendering is expected to begin in April 1981.
Where ICB is used, domestic manufacturers of furniture and equipment would
be allowed a margin of preference of 15 percent or the existing applicable
rate of import duties, whichever is lower, over the c.i.f. price of competing
foreign suppliers, and qualified domestic civil works contractors would be
allowed a preferential margin of seven and one half percent of the bid prices
of competing foreign contractors.
49.        Architectural/engineering consultants appointed under the ongoing
third project for proposed expansion of Chancellor College have been retained
for designing and supervising works at the College in this project. Designs
already prepared by PIU as part of a national standardization of designs
for secondary school facilities will be used for all the schools. Approxi-
mately 35 man-years of consulting services at a cost of US$2.2 million are
included in the project. This consists of about 35 man-years at an average
cost of about US$5,200 per month to provide 24 man-years of architectural/
engineering and 11 man-years of construction supervision services. In addi-
tion, about one year of technical assistance and other services to help
prepare the national education plan is estimated at US$100,000 (US$8,300 per
month). Other external assistance in preparing the plan is being funded by
UNDP (para. 45). Agreement was reached that the Government would employ
suitable architectural, engineering, or planning consultants whose qualifica-
tions, experience and terms of employment would be satisfactory to the
Association (Section 3.03 of draft Credit Agreement).



- 15 -
Disbursements and Audits
50.       Proceeds from the proposed Credit would be disbursed as follows:  75
percent of total expenditures for civil works; 80 percent of off-the-shelf
local expenditures, and 100 percent of foreign expenditures for furniture and
equipment; 80 percent of total expenditures for project administration; and 80
percent of local and 100 percent of foreign expenditures for consulting
services and costs of preparing the education plan. A schedule of estimated
disbursements is provided in the Credit and Project Summary.
51.       Separate project accounts would be maintained by MOE for each
component. It was agreed that these accounts would be audited by the Auditor
General or other independent auditors acceptable to the Association and
the audit reports furnished to the Association not later than 9 months after
the end of the fiscal year (Section 4.01 (c) of the draft Credit Agreement).
Agreement was also reached that the Government would monitor progress of the
project and, not later than three months after the Closing Date, or other such
agreed date, would prepare and submit to the Association a full report on the
execution of the project (3.05 4.b) and (d) of the draft Credit Agreement).
Benefits and Risks
52.       The project would improve access to secondary education by providing
additional secondary school places. An increase of about 1,000 secondary
school graduates per year would result from the project, thus meeting a
significant proportion of education manpower needs throughout the economy.
The project would provide about 47 percent of the secondary school places
to girls and would raise their participation in secondary education from 31
percent to 35 percent. The additional secondary schoolteacher training places
would increase also the supply of science graduates. The preinvestment studies
would lead to the establishment of institutions for training about 210 primary
teachers a year who would teach about 11,000 children per year, and for
training about 600 civil servanLs per year. In assisting the preparation of
the national education plan, the project would help the Government make more
effective use of education expeaditures and improve its overall analysis,
planning, management and organization.
53.       The only significant risk of the project is a possible shortage of
secondary schoolteachers. In order to minimize the risk, the Government
would prepare an annual review of its teacher training programs, recruitment
and placement of secondary schoolteachers and proposals for any necessary
program revisions (para. 43).
PART V - LEGAL INSTRUMENTS AND AUTHORITY
54.       The draft Development Credit Agreement between the Republic of
Malawi and the Association and the recommendation of the Committee provided for in
Article V, Section 1 (d), of the Articles of Agreement of the Association,
are being distributed separately to the Executive Directors.



- 16 -
55.       Special conditions of this project are listed in Section III
of Annex III.
56.       I am satisfied that the proposed credit would comply with the
Articles of Agreement of the Association.
PART VI - RECOMMENDATION
57.       I recommend that the Executive Directors approve the proposed
credit.

C. BANK PROJECTS IN EXECUTION
Credit No. S-17-MAI       Transport Engineering and Services Project; US$2.0
Million Credit of June 13, 1974; Date of Effective-
ness: August 28, 1974; Closing Date: June 30, 1981
The project helps determine the infrastructural requirements
and provides technical assistance for the exploitation of the Viphya forest
resources. Necessary transportation studies and the design of the required
transport facilities have been completed. Part of the credit proceeds that
remained were used to assist in putting together a financial package for
the proposed mill. The package is still incomplete, however, and the pro-
posed project is still being analyzed by the Government. The Closing Date
was extended to June 30, 1981.
Credit No. 523-MAI        Second Highway Project; US$10.0 Million Credit
of December 19, 1974; Date of Effectiveness;
February 21, 1975; Closing Date: June 30, 1982
The project consists of reconstructing to two-lane bituminous
paved standard the Lilongwe-Kasungu road (about 70 miles), including a
bypass around the Lilongwe industrial area and reconstructing the Ligadzi
bridge; and a pilot program in one district for improving development and
maintenance of district roads. Construction works for the main road are
complete and savings of approximately US$3.5 million were realized for this
component. Results from the pilot program for district roads improvement
and maintenance indicate clearly that the program has been successful and
that it is feasible to extend it to other districts. The savings from the
reconstruction component are being used to extend the pilot program to three
additional districts; accordingly the Credit Agreement was amended by letter
of June 9, 1978 and the Closing Date was extended to June 30, 1982.
Credit No. 590-MAI        Second Education Project; US$11.6 Million Credit
of November 24, 1975; Date of Effectiveness;
February 24, 1976; Closing Date: December 31, 1981
The project provides for constructing 22 model primary schools
as examples for replication by communities and facilities at the schools
for a rural education program; it establishes a new primary teacher college;
adds practical subjects in selected secondary schools with emphasis on
facilities to increase female enrollment. As costs permitted, the project
scope was enlarged to include computer facilities for the Malawi Certificate
Examination and Testing Board and additional staff housing. All contracts
have been awarded and, except for minor additional construction at a number
of primary schools, the project has been substantially completed. At the
Government's request the Bank Group recently extended the Closing Date to
December 31, 1981 to permit completion of all contracts.

ANNEX II
Loan No. 1286-MAI        Second Karonga Rural Development Project;
US$9.2 Million Loan of June 24, 1976; Date of
EffectivEness:  August 18, 1976; Closing Date
March 31, 1981
The project, financed on Third Window terms, consists of seasonal-
and medium-term credit to farmers, extension service, market complexes,
health facilities, boreholes and other infrastructural facilities, agri-
cultural and hydrological research, preparatory investments for the National
Rural Development Programme, and rehabilitation of berthing facilities at
Chipoka Lake terminal. Improvement of Chipoka harbor has been completed.
Although understaffing hampers imaplementation efficiency and small cost
increases have occurred, the project's progress is satisfactory.
Credit No. 711-MAI       Blantyre Water Supply Project; US$7.0 Million
Credit of June 3, 1977; Date of Effectiveness;
April 18, 1978; Closing Date: March 31, 1982
Initial delays in project implementation occurred due to revision of
the project's scope, but implemeatation is now proceeding reasonably well.
Detailed engineering is substantially complete; bid documents have been issued
and awards made on three of the four contracts being financed by the Associa-
tion with the award of the fourth contract expected shortly. However, due to
the initial delay, commissioning of the works is now scheduled for late 1982,
rather than December 1980 estimated at appraisal.
Credit No. 758-MAI       Third Highway Project; US$10.5 Million Credit of
January 18, 1978; Date of Effectiveness: June 29,
1978; Closing Date: June 30, 1981
The project consists of constructing the 52-mile Kasungu-Jenda
road to two-lane bituminous surfaced standard; strengthening three short
sections of the Zomba-Lilongwe road; and providing consultant services
for the supervision of the roads, and for the feasibility and engineering
studies of the Jenda-Mzuzu road. Construction works on the Kasungu-Jenda
road are almost completed, and strengthening works on the Zomba-Lilongwe
road are well underway. Studies for the Jenda-Mzuzu road are nearing
completion, and consultants are preparing tender documents.

ANNEX II
Credit No. 823-MAI       Shire Valley Agricultural Consolidation Project;
US$10.7 Million Credit of July 7, 1978; Date of
Effectiveness: September 6, 1978; Closing Date
December 31, 1982
The project is the consolidation phase of the Shire Valley Agri-
cultural Development Programme and includes extension services to support
increased cotton and foodcrop production, seed multiplication and afforesta-
tion programs, production credit, livestock and fisheries development, health
and potable water supply facilities, a smallholder irrigation development
study and some rural roads. It will provide social and infrastructure
services to about 70,000 families. The Valley attained self-sufficiency
in food crops for the first time in its history in 1977/78. Cotton produc-
tion also regained the levels attained in the early 1970s. Guar bean pro-
duction is rising rapidly, but groundnut production is declining. The
project had a slow start because of staffing shortages and procurement
delays. Although steps have been taken to improve staffing, it remains
a problem, with inadequate middle level staff and delays in replacement of
senior staff. Civil works and road construction, although somewhat behind
schedule, are proceeding well. Production estimates for cotton and maize for
1979/80 show a further decrease from 1977/78 and 1978/79 levels, while guar
beans have continued to increase. Apart from maize and guar, the areas
planted to crops decreased, and a severe drought from December 1979 through
March 1980 also affected yields.
Loan No. 1610-MAI        Investment and Development Bank of Malawi Limited;
US$3.0 Million Loan of July 7, 1978; Date of
Effectiveness: November 1, 1978; Closing Date:
July 1, 1983
The project provides foreign exchange for financing medium- to
large-scale industrial and agro-industrial investments, and will help
INDEBANK consolidate its policies and procedures and develop project
promotion. To date, US$1.3 million has been committed for three sub-
projects and more commitments are expected shortly.
Credit No. 857-MAI       National Rural Development Programme Project
Phase-I; US$22.0 Million Credit of December 21,
1978; Date of Effectiveness: April 5, 1979;
Closind Date: September 30, 1983
The project is assisting the Government in implementing the first
phase of Malawi's National Rural Development Programme. Over a five-year
period it aims to increase output of maize, groundnuts, fire-cured tobacco
and rice, and expand milk and meat production. It will strengthen the
Ministry of Agriculture and Natural Resources' Central Service, four existing
Management Units and establish eight new development areas. It will also
complete the consolidation phase of the Lilongwe Land Development Programme.
The project is cofinanced by CIDA, DEG, EDF, and ODM. It is proceeding
satisfactorily except for staffing and recurrent financing problems.

Credit No. 910-MAI       Third Edu-cation Project; US$14.5 Million Credit
EEC Credit No. 12-MAI   June 19, 1979; Date of Effectiveness:  September 4,
1979; Closing Date: June 30, 1984
The project is assisting the Government in improving and expanding
primary and secondary education and improving curriculum development, in-
service training and management of education. Its major components include
constructing, furnishing and equ:.pping primary schools; improving and expand-
ing primary teacher training, secondary teacher training, secondary and
technical schools; providing prinlary school textbooks; establishing an Insti-
tute of Education responsible for- curriculum development, in-service teacher
training, and materials preparation; and assisting school inspectorates,
architectural and engineering services, educational studies and project
administration. An EEC Special Action Credit of US$7.5 million was made
available to the project. Implementation is proceeding well and on time.
Credit No. 992-MAI       National Rural Development Programme (NRDP) Project
Phase II (Wood Energy); US$13.8 Million Credit of
April 25, 1980; Date of Effectiveness: June 9, 1980;
Closing Late:  December 31, 1985
The project is assisting the Government in its long-term energy
development program aimed at increasing forest resources. It will establish
a national network of 88 nurseries to produce seedlings for sale to small-
holders, who will be encouraged to establish their own woodlots; fuelwood and
pole plantations to help meet increasing demands from the commercial and
industrial sectors, as well as from urban dwellers; and an energy unit in the
Forestry Department of the Ministry of Agriculture and Natural Resources. It
will finance preinvestment activities for launching NRDP phase III. Imple-
mentation is proceeding satisfactorily.
