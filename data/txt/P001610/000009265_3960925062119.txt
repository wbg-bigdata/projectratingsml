FOURTH EDUCATION PROJECT
(CREDIT 1123-MAI)
PREFACE
This is a Project Completion Report (PCR) on the Fourth Education
Project in Malawi, whose estimated cost of US$53.76 million equivalent was
financed by the International Development Association (IDA) Credit 1123-MAI
of US$41.0 million (SDR 32.2 million), approved on March 26, 1981, and by
Government funds amounting to US$12.76 million equivalent. The actual cost
was US$33.3 million equivalent, 38% lower than the appraijal estimate. The
cost underrun was due mainly to the devaluation of the local currency. The
original Closing Date of December 31, 1985, was postponed to December 31,
1986, and the account was finally closed on July 30, 1987 when a undis-
bursed balance of SDR 8.28 million (US$10.50 million) equivalent was
cancelled.
The PCR was prepared, with the agreement of the Government of
Malawi, by UNESCO under the Bank-UNESCO Cooperative Program. It is based
on (a) evaluation and completion reports prepared by the Ministry of
Education and Culture and the Project Implementation Unit; (b) a UNESCO
field mission in February-March 1988; and (c) information from IDA files
and intezviews with Government officials involved in the project.
This PCR was read by the Operations Evaluation Department.   The
draft PCR was sent to the Borrower and its agencies for comment on
August 14, 1989. Comments received are reproduced as Attachment I.

PROJECT COMPLETION REPORT
MALAWI
FOURTH EDUCATION PROJECT (CREDIT 1123-MAI)
EVALUATION QUMMARY
Introduction
1.       The Fourth Education Project in £ialawi was first mentioned in a
discussion between Bank Group and Malawi Treasury officials in Washington
in April 1979.   Following project identification by an IDA mission in
Malawi in June 1979, the project was prepared by the Government, with some
IDA assistance. The original Government proposal was a much larger project
with an estimated cost of US$50.3 million. This was well above the project
cost limit implicit in the proposed Credit ceiling of US$26.0 million to
cover 80% of the project cost. The IDA pre-appraisal mission in November
1979 assisted the Government in reformulating the project to focus on areas
on highest priority.  The project was appraised in May-June 1980 with an
estimated cost of US$53.76 million equivalent, including taxes of US$2.5
million equivalent.   The project was to be financed by an IDA Credit of
US$41.0 million equivalent (SDR 32.20 million), and by Go~-...rnment funds
totalling US$12.76 million equivalent.   The project was approved by the
Board on March 26, 1981 and, following Credit signing on May 29, 1981, the
Credit became effective on October 2, 1981.   Project completion was
scheduled for June 30, 1985 and the Closing Date was to be December 31,
1985, which was subsequently extended to December 31, 1986. Actual project
completion was about June 1986, at the cost of US$33.3 million equivalent
or 38% lower than the appraisal estimate, and MK45.85 million which was 7%
above the appraisal estimate.  The credit account was closed on July 30,
1987 when the undisbursed balance of SDR 8.28 million was cancelled.
Objectives and Project Content
2.       The main objective was to provide much needed middle-level man-
power through the expansion and improvement of secondary education and
training teachers.  A subsidiary objective was to improve the quality of
primary education and strengthen the civil service through feasibility
studies on the establishment of a new teacher training college and an
Institute of Public Administration for training higher level Government
staff. The project would also finance the preparation of a national educa-
tion plan. As agreed, the project comprised the following:
(a)  To Provide Middle-Level Manpower.   Construction, furnishing, and
equipping of (i) 3,960 additional secondary school places, includ-
ing expansion of six existing schools and construction of five new
schools, each of tLe schools to accommodate 480 students; and (ii)
168 additional places at Chancellor College for secondary teacher
training.

(b) To Improve Primary Education Ouality. Carrying out pre-investment
studies for a new teacher trainiing college.
(c)  To Strengthen the Civil Service.   Carrying out pre-investment
studies for a new Institute of Public Administration in Lilongwe.
(d) To Improve the Education System. Preparation of a national educa-
tion plan.
Implementation Exwerience
3.       As this project was launched while the Third Education Project was
still in progress, the same PIU was responsible for implementation.
Malawian staff included the PIU Director, a procurement officer, an
accountant, three architectural assistants and a number of support staff.
Expatriate staff provided by the Danish International Development Agency
(DANIDA), the Commonwealth Fund for Technical Co-operation (CFTC), and the
Japan Volunteer Overseas Co-operation (JVOC) comprised two senior archi-
tects, five architects, two supervising engineers, and a quantity surveyor.
Project start-up was slow because of difficulties in acquiring consulting
services for preparing tendor documents for secondary schools. The secon-
dary school construction program was delayed by (i) the addition for exten-
sion of two secondary schools transferred from the Third Education Project;
(ii) unavailability of imported materials due to foreign exchange restric-
tions (subsequently resolved by the Bank Group); (iii) shortage of local
bricks; and (iv) tardy release of local funds. Construction delay was also
experienced at Chancellor College where work was completed in the 4th
quarter of 1986, compared with the scheduled completion in June 1984.
Overall, however, about 90% of construction was completed within the
appraisal implementation schedule. The actual gross area constructed was
24% more than the 64,300 sq. meters estimated at appraisal.  Part of the
increase was due to the construction of new hostels, which was found to be
cheaper than renovating old hostels, and part was due to extensions in two
schools. The furniture supplied was generally satisfactory, and the equip-
ment procure appeared adequate although some items were not relevant to the
curriculum. Technical assistance, which was provided by DANIDA, CFTC and
JVOC, totalled 27 man-years instead of the 35 man-years envisaged at
appraisal.
Results
4.       The project objectives and the expected benefits were generally
achieved. While the pre-investment study on the teacher training college
was transferred to the Fifth Education Project, that on the Malawi
Institute of Management required a year's extension of the Closing Date.
Twelve studies, mostly transferred from the Third Education Project, were
undertaken, and a National Development Plan for Education (1985-1995) was
prepared. Despite a few shortcomings, these studies have provided valuable
information for the deve opment of the education system.   The National
Development Plan for Education has provided a framework for the development
of education at all levels and for discussions between the Government and
aid agencies, including the Bank Group. In 1987/88, enrollments in project



- viii -
secondary schools increased by about 4,370 compared with the project target
of 3,960.  At Chancellor College, enrollment in the Faculty of Education
grew from 314 in 1982/83 to 461 in 1986/87, and the 1986 output of 203
secondary teachers was 56% higher than the pre-project output of 130.
Technical assistance was implemented generally as planned and consultants'
performance was satisfactory.
5.       Some flaws were apparent in the design of the secondary schools.
The elaborate design of the covered walkway with a width of 4.27 meters was
excessive, but there was no covered walkway leading to the classrooms so
that in rainy weather students and staff would get drenched. Although no
provision was made In the appraisal worksheets, the teaching and adminis-
trative areas included open patios which totalled 640 sq. meters or 21% of
the total area. With no particular function, these open patios are waste-
ful and have no precedent in Malawi school construction.   These design
flaws should have been discovered in the first two schools and not repeated
in every subsequent school. Remedial action has been taken in the Fifth
Education Project.
Sustainability
6.       The secondary schools are likely to be sustained as an integral
part of the secondary education system. Similarly, Chancellor College as a
constituent body of the University of Malawi will be sustained as long as
the university system is maintained. Thus, the question is not whether the
investments made will be sustained, but at what level the project institu-
tions will be sustained.   Evidently there is no effective maintenance
program for the schools, in part because maintenance is a bureaucratic
procedure requiring action by the Ministry of Works, in part because funds
have been inadequate. The result is that cupboard doors are falling off,
faucets and toilets are leaking, equipment is not functioning and cannot be
replaced, and many classrooms are without adequate furniture. If these
conditions are coupled with the shortage of textbooks and other teaching
materials, it may be concluded that sustainability is unlikely to be at a
high level.
Findings and Lessons
7.       At appraisal, Malawi's secondary school enrollment of only 4% of
the relevant age group was one of the lowest in the region. By widening
access to secondary education and expanding the output of secondary school
graduates, the project has helped to relieve the bottleneck in the develop-
ment of middle- and higher-level manpower.   The parallel expansion of
Chancellor College was necessary to ensure an adequate supply of trained
secondary teachers to manage the expansion of secondary schools. In these
respects the project was well designed.  In retrospect, however, project
design was deficient in making no provision for strengthening the
Borrower's project planning and management capability.   After 20 years
(1967-87) of implementing IDA-financed projects, the PIU has remained weak
in technical personnel. The project should have included a staff develop-
ment plan for the PIU and the necessary policy put in place to allow the
PIU to recruit and retain highly skilled staff. Experience with this proj-
ect also suggests the importance of the following:



- ix -
(a) Sufficient time should be given to develop and test a prototype
architectural design intended for a number of schools before large
scale construction is undertaken;
(b) Project planning should include verifying and taking the necessary
steps to ensure the availability of local buildings materials; and
(c) Provision should be made for in-service training of teachers in
the use of new equipment to be supplied under the project and of
principals in school management where qualitative and organiza-
tional changes are expected as a result of the project.



L PROJECT BACKGROUND
Soio-Economic Setting
1.01  In 1979, when discussions on the Fourth Education Project were initiated,
Malawi was among the least developed and most densely populated countries
in Africa. With a population estimated at 5.9 million and growing at 2.9 per
cent per annum, density averaged 136 persons per square kilometre of arable
land. GNP per capita was approximately US$200 equivalent. Ninety per cent
of the population lived in rural areas and depended on subsistence farming.
Government policy for economic aevelopment was to invest resources in directly
productive sectors rather than the social sector. National planning and investment
therefore were directed towards small-holder agriculture, infrastructure and
public utilities, the major objective being to attract private investment. Despite
efforts to stimulate economic growth, the real growth rate of GDP declined
from 7.9 per cent in 1977 to 4.4 per cent in 19-i9 and to 0.6 per cent in 1980.
The economy was adversely affected by poor weather conditions, high fuel costs
and a 15 per cent drorp in the price of cured tobacco between 1979 and 1980.
The annual growth rat' in agriculture - the mainstay of the Malawian economy
- fell from 3.7 per cent in 1975 to 2.8 per cent in 1979.
1.02 Manpower needs: In the past the Government had deliberately restricted
the growth of secondary education to avoid having unemployed secondary school
leavers. This action severely limited the supply of trained manpower to fill job
vacancies at the middle and upper levels. Economic expansion in the 1970s
increased the demand for trained Malawians. Consequently, large numbers of
expatriates were employed to fill posts, especially at the middle and higher levels.
The demand for trained personnel at these levels was projected by Bank staff
to increase from 120,000 in 1979 to about 202,800 by 1990 - approximately 25
per cent requiring University graduates, 33 per cent requiring upper secondary
graduates and 42 per cent requiring lower secondary graduates.
fhe Education Sector
1.03 Enrolment at primary level was 779,676 in 1979/80 - approximately 62
per cent of the 6-13 age cohort. The problems and issues included excessively
low teacher:pupil ratios (approximately 1:62) and high drop-out and repetition
rates, especially among girls and between Standard 1 (Grade 1) and Standard
IV (Grade 4).
1.04 The upgrading and expansion of the sub-sector was being addressed by
the Third Education Project which included provision for (i) constructing,
furnishing and equipping 1,000 classrooms and 500 teachers' houses and expanding
one teachers' training college to accommodate an additional 120 trainees and
(ii) procuring and distributing 2.2 million textbooks.



-2 -
1.05 Enrolment in secondary education grew at approximately 15.8 per cent
per annum from 3,100 in 1962 to 13,400 in 1972. After 1972, the average
enrolment growth rate slowed down to three per cent per annum and by 1979
only 16,500 students or four per cent of the age group 14-17 were enrolled - 5,600
in the 22 national boarding schools, 7,900 in the 28 'district day' schools and 3,000
in Government-aided schools. Secondary school places were available for only
14 per cent (5,210) of the children who passed the Primary School Leaving
Certificate (PSLC) Examination. Low female enrolment in secondary schools
(about 31 per cent) persisted over the years partly because of the high drop-out
rates among girls at the primary level. The supply of secondary school graduates
to pursue post-secondary education and training remained inadequate to meet
the need for middle and higher level manpower.
1.06 Approximately 69 per cent of the students who entered the secondary
system sat and passed the Junior Certificate (JC) examination, given at the end
of the second year, and about 56 per cent of those who continued to the fourth
year (final year) passed the Malawi School Certificate of Education (MSCE)
Examination. The secondary school curriculum was oriented towards language
arts, science and mathematics. In the 1970s, with some assistance from the
First Education Project, the Government introduced some technical subjects
(home economics, needlework and dressmaking, metalwork and woodwork) into
a number of secondary schools; however, in view of the high operational costs
of technical education, the shortage of trained teachers and general lack of student
interest in the skills areas, MOE decided not to expand the teaching of technical
subjects in the secondary schools.
1.07 Although physical facilities were adequate in most boarding secondary
schools, many "district" schools had inadequate teaching facilities and makeshift
dormitories. Government policy in the 1970s was to provide full dormitory space
for all "district" schools, except i..-<e located in the three major urban centres
where dormitory space was restricted to 50 per cent of the total enrolment.
MOE planned also to double the size of the 240-place schools so as to increase
enrolment at reasonable unit costs.
1.08 Over 90 per cent of the 800 secondary school teachers in 1980/81 were
trained. Expatriates comprised 25 per cent of the trained teachers. Secondary
teacher training was offered at the Chancellor College of the University of Malawi.
The output of trained teachers declined from 40 in 1973 to 10 in 1979. The College
planned to expand its secondary teacher training programme with an admission
of 155 new students in October 1980. It was estimated that the secondary system
would need about 100 new teachers annually by 1984 and approximately 130 per
year by 1989.
1.09 At Chancellor College, the physical facilities were inadequate for the
proposed student enrolment growth. The science laboratories were over-used,
science equipment was stored in the haliway, and library and classroom facilities
were inadequate. The staff:student ratio was 1:9. It was estimated that the
College needed to increase its enrolment from 745 in 1979/80 to 1,200 by 1983/84
so as to (i) increase the output of trained teachers and (ii) reduce the staff:student
ratio and hence improve internal efficiency.



-3 -
1.iO Recurrent education expenditure in 1980/81 was K23.60 million, 11.37
per cent of overall Government expenditure for that year and 2.02 per cent of
GDP. Primary education absorbed 39 per cent, secondary 14 per cent and
University education 25 per cent of the total education expenditure.
1.11 Objectives for the growth and development of Education during the 1970s
were set-out in the Education Development Plan (1973-1980). The overall
objectives were to (i) improve internal efficiency of the education system, (ii)
achieve a more equitable distribution of educational opportunities, and (iii)
continue efforts to re-orient the curricuia. During the Plan period the Government
succeeded in expanding education at both primary and secondary levels. The
problems of secondary education were to be addressed by expanding the secondary
teacher education facilities at Chancellor College and providing new school places.
1.12 The proposed project was first mentioned in a discussion between Bank
Group and Malawi Treasury Officials in Washington in April 1979 and an IDA
identification mission visited Malawi in June 1979. The Government undertook
project preparation, using local resources and some assistance from IDA in
specialized areas. Originally the Government conceived of a project to
(a)   construct, furnish and equip
- 18 district wecondary schools (5,480 places)
- One designated secondary school
- One primary teachers' training college
- 15 Malawi Correspondence College Satellite Centres,
(b)   expand activities at Chancellor College of the University of Malawi for
the training of additional secondary school teachers (168 places),
(c)   construct, furnish and equip an Institute of Public Administration, and
(d)   upgrade facilities for the Malawi Central Examinations and Testing Board
(MCETB),
with an estimated cost of US$50.3 million (MK40 million-/). This was well above
the project cost limit of US$32.5 million implicit in the proposed credit ceiling
of US$26.0 million to cover 80 per cent of the project cost.
1.13 A pre-appraisal mission visited Malawi in November 1979 and assisted
the Government in reformulating the project components and in selecting areas
of highest priority. The Credit Application was made by the Government in
the first quarter of 1980 for a project comprising 3,960 "district" secondary school
places, expansion of secondary teachertraining, pre-investment studies,
development of a National Education Plan, 1985-1990 and the establishment
of an Institute of Public Administration (IPA). The Institute was subsequently
deleted from the proposal and replaced by a pre-investment study for IPA and
two secondary schools.

-5-
1.14   The major project component was the provision of secondary school
places. For more efficient implementation and because of cost constraints,
there was an exchange of project components between the Third and the proposed
Fourth Education Proiects. Four secondary schools and five studies were
transferred from the Third to the proposed Fourth and the library expansion
at Chancellor College proposed under both projects was consolidated and
implemented under the Third Project. Science facilities were combined under
the proposed Fourth Education Project.
1.15   The proposed project was appraised in May/June, 1980. No major changes
were made. Negotiations took place on 14-16 January, 1981 and the Project
was presented to the Board in March of the same year. The Credit Agreement
was signed on 29 May, 1981 and became effective on 2 October, 1981.
1.16   At appraisal, it was assumed that (i) moderate growth in enrolment,
(ii) improved teacher:student ratios, and (iii) continued upgrading of educational
facilities would result in raising educational expenditure from 11 per cent of
total Government expenditure in 1980/81 to 15 per cent in 1985/86 and 16 per
cent by 1990/91.
1.17   Project Objectives and Content. The agreed Project was designed (a)
to expand and improve the Malawi secondary education programme through
(i) the training of teachers and (ii) providing new secondary school places, and
(b) to help to prepare a National Education Plan of expansion and improvement
of the education system. The components intended to achieve these objectives
are summarized in Table 1.1. Overall the Project included 24 years of
professional services of architectural consultants for site layouts, cost estimates
and supervision and 11 years of specialist services for supervision of construction.
1.18   Project Benefits and Risks. The Appraisal Report identified the expected
benefits of the proposed project as (i) improved access to secondary education,
(ii) increased annual output of trained teachers for secondary schools, and (iii)
support for the future development of the Malawi education and training system
through the preparation of a National Education Plan (1985-1990) and through
pre-investment studies. The only element of risk foreseen in the Report was
a shortage of trained secondary school teachers to meet the needs of the
expansion. This risk was minimized by including a requirement that Chancellor
College prepare for review by the Bank Group an annual report of its teacher
training programmes, the recruitment and placement of secondary school teachers
and proposals for any necessary revisions of its programme.

IL PROJECT IMPLEMENTATION
Overview
2.01 The Project was originally scheduled to be completed on 30 June 1985
(i.e. in 49 months) but was actually completed in December 1986 (in 67 months).
The Closing Date of the Credit was extended primarily for the completion of
the pre-investment study for the establishment of the Malawian Institute of
Management. All Covenants have been fulfilled. Although there were
shortcomings in the design of the schools and some aspects of procurement, the
Project as a whole has been satisfactorily completed and its objectives have
been generally achieved.
2.02  Changes in the Project. The Development 1 redit Agreement was amended
in 1984 to include the expansion of two additional existing secondary schools
namely, Nkhotakota and Likoma Island. These schools were transferred to the
Fourth Education Project from the Third Education Project primarily because
of insufficiency of funds under the Third Project. This change was expected
to improve the logistics of implementation as the Fourth Education Project was
concentrated mainly on the development of secondary education. The number
of schools to be expanded, therefore, increased from six to eight and the total
number of planned new secondary places increased from 3,960 to 4,440. The
pre-investment study for the establishment of a primary teachers' training college
was transferred to the Fifth Education Project which had primary teacher training
as a major component.
Project Management
2.03 PIU Staffing and Organization. The PIU was established as the project
implementation arm of the MOE Planning Unit, with responsibility for the
implementation of all education development projects. The PIU had satisfactorily
completed the Second Education Project and was implementing the Third. It
has since succesfully completed the Third, has implemented this Fourth Education
Project and is now implementing the Fifth Education Project and the First Sector
Credit.
2.04  The PIU was under the direction of a Malawian project manager; however,
all professional services for the Project were provided by expatriates from the
Danish International Development Agency (DANIDA), the Commonwealth Fund
for Technical Co-operation (CFTC) and the Japan Volunteer Overseas Co-operation
(JVOC). The expatriate technical staff comprised two senior architects, five
architects, two supervising engineers and a quantity surveyor (Annex 1). Up
to the time of the completion mission no Malawian architects or quantity surveyors



- 7 -
had been employed by the PIU (a Malawian architect on training was expected
to return in September 1988). A procurement specialist provided through the
Overseas Development Administration (ODA) retired in September 1982 and
was replaced by a Malawian procurement officer. Other PIU staff included an
accountant (assigned by the Accountant General's Office), three architectural
assistants and a number of support staff. An assistant project manager was
appointed in June 1985. All professional staff associated with the Project had
left the cout try by March 1988, except one DANIDA architect who was scheduled
to leave in April 1988.
2.05  Over the long association with implementing IDA assisted projects, starting
in 1967, a full range of prcject management capabilities could have been built
up with a well considered staff development strategy. To the extent that the
Fourth Education Project included nothing along these lines, it has to be considered
as flawed. There are two aspects of institution building in project management
under this Project that deserve special mention. The first has to do with
architectural and engineering services. It is inimical to institution building to
have so high a turnover of architects as occured in this Project (para. 2.04).
Furthermore the exclusive dependence on expatriate professionals in architecture
and engineering contributed to (a) the uneconomic open patios in all 13 schools
and (b) some expensive construction detailing which was foreign to the Malawian
construction industry and which was due to the unfamiliarity of expatriate
architects with local construction practice. Thus the dependence on expatriate
professionals has had a cost that needs to be addressed. Malawian architects
should be employed by the PIU to steer the present professional practice towards
more acceptable economic Malawian building approaches. It is clear that at
appraisal the question of use of Malawian for these professional services should
have been examined and arrangements made to secure them. The second issue
relates to the upgrading of the capabilities of the Procurement Section and Project
management generally. No fellowships were provided in procurement of project
management although these were clearly needed.
2.06 The start-up of the Project was slow because the PIU experienced
difficulties in acquiring consulting services for the preparation of the tender
documents for secondary schools. Tender documents for the additional two
schools were completed without delay. Long delays were also experienced in
the overall construction programme regarding both the secondary schools and
Chancellor College and in procuring furniture and equipment (Annex 2).
Profesial Services and Builn Design
2.07 Sites. The sites for 10 of the proposed secondary schools were selected
before appraisal, the remaining site at Blantyre was selected well within the
programme time. The two schools added to the programme were extensions
to existing schools and, therefore, did not present any site selection problems.
There are some settlement problems on the walkways at Nkhotakota Secondary
School which should be further examined. All schools have an adequate supply
of water and very good surface water drainage. Nine of the 10 secondary schools
visited have electricity. Vehicular access to the schools is adequate. All sites
are fenced and provided with an attractive "name wall" and entrance gates.
Sufficient land had already been acquired for the expansion at Chancellor College
under the Third Education Project.



2.08 DesiRn. For the secondary schools and related staff houses, the PIU prepared
stanJard designs which received IDA approval at appraisal. The school design
pro,vides intemal spaces with acceptable thermal comfort and adequate natural
and artificial lighting. The single spine layout of classrooms has produced a
pleasant e4nvironment with low noise level transfer which is desirable for secondary
education. The teaching areas are generally in accordance with the work-sheets,
but the circulation in the administration area could have been improved if more
space had been provided. The covered walkway area is in accordance with the
work-sheets but it does not provide cover up to the classrooms. The kitchen
layout of the home economics block will require further modification to allow
the pupils a clear view of the chalkboard, and the library layout does not allow
any flexibility for book display. No areas are given in the worksheets for the
open patio attached to each teaching and administrative area. This may have
been an oversight. The area of the open patios is approximately 640 m2 - 21
per cent of the total area. The open patios are wasteful and have no precedent
in Malawi school construction. The elaborate design of the walkway with a width
of 4.27 metres is also unfortunate. These design excesses should have been
discovered in the first two schools and not repeated in every subsequent school.
The PIU has removed the open patios from the design and reduced the width
of the covered walkway in the Fifth Education Project. In future, when a standard
design is to be repeated, lead time needs to be given to construct a prototype
before tendering the remainder.
2.09 The extensions to Chancellor College were designed around space standards
similar to those of the existing buildings and the integration of new with existing
buildings was sklfully done. The relationship of scale and the juxtaposition of
the buildings were suitably planned, giving an overall effect of aesthetic and
functional accommodation.
2.10 The design for the teacher's house is spatially adequate and the staff are
generally satisfied with the room arrangement. The houses, however, are very
hot, as there is no insulated ceiling under the corrugated metal roof.
2.11 User Participation. The design shortcomings suggest that there was
insufficient dialogue between the users (headmasters, specialist teachers and
school inspectors) and the PIU during the planning of the schools. The comments
by the MOW Planning Unit in their report "Evaluation of the Third and the Fourth
Education F.oject" dated January 1986 suggested also a lack of c3mmunication
between PIU architects and the users. For future projects, it is advisable that
MOEC appoint a steering committee for planning discussions with the PIU
architects and co-opt, when necessary, department heads to discuss the design
of special areas. It would also be useful in the future to arrange a pre-handover
inspection visit with MOEC supervisors and the headteach-cs in order to ensure
that the physical facilities function in the manner expected before the handover
of the schools.
2.12 Supervision. The PIU supervised the construction of five schools and
employed two consulting architectural firms to supervise the remaining eight
schools. The consultants prepared site plans but utilized the PIU standard drawings
for all buildings. Quantity surveyors were also employed by PIU for the preparation
of bills of quantities and contract documents. There were no marked differences



in the quality of workmanship which was generally satisfactory. There are a
few defects, however. At one school there are no counter-weights for the fume
cupboard doors - a potential danger to students. The malfunctioning kitchen
flue at the Phalombe school presents a fire hazard; the PIU is making arrangements
for its repair. It is possible that the kitchen flues in the other schools have a
similar defect, even though, because these schools use mainly the electric cookers,
defects of the wood fire cookers may not be readily evident.
2.13 Materials Specification. The material specification is generally suitable
for school construction. The quality of the stainless steel laboratory sinks,
however, should be examined against the specification and redress obtained from
the contractor for replacement, as these sinks are rusting after very limited
use. The laboratory tables should have had two sinks instead of one; their
usefulness for practical classes is severely constrained with only one sink. The
laminated timber used for construction was more expensive than solid timber.
The PIU explained, however, that solid timber was unavailable.
Civil Wo*rs and lutmanoe
2.14 Construction. The civil works were delayed by the: (i) addition of two
secondary schools extensions to the programme, (ii) unavailability of imported
materials which was due to foreign exchange restrictions (subsequently resolved
by the Bank Group Special Foreign Account Arrangement), and (iii) tardy release
of local financing. The Project buildings were constructed during a period of
slow activity in the local construction industry, thus, benefitting from stable
prices of labour and materials. The main difficulty experienced was the supply
of local bricks in the quantity and of the quality required. The village industries
were not organized for producing such large amounts of bricks and the building
contractors had to assist with the transport of clay and firewood for firing the
kilns. In addition, the quality of the bricks in some instances was below acceptable
standards. In anticipation of the demand for bricks, there should have been a
training programme for the village brickmakers to upgade their skills and a
search for more efficient kiln design to improve the hardness of the bricks.
2.15 Construction was carried out by Malawian based contractors, with foreign
associates and or parent companies, who all performed well. There are no
outstanding claims on the Project and adjustments for the devaluation of the
Malawian kwacha have been settled within the contingency provision of the
contract conditions. About 90 per cent of the civil works was completed within
the appraisal schedule (Annex 2). Overall, the 79,824 m2 actual gross area
constructed was 24 per cent more than the 64,307 m2 estimated at appraisal
(Annex 3), the reason being that (i) it was found to be more economical to build
new hostels than to renovate the old hostels at the existing schools; and (ii) the
two school extensions added to the Project increased the gross area by 9,915
m2 - approximately 15 per cent. It was also found to be more economical to
renovate some staff houses than to repair them. The physical facilities by type
of institution were provided in accordance with the appraisal estimates (Table
2.1).

2.16  Maintenatice. There is no effective maintenance programme for the
schools - cupboard doors are falling off, faucets and W.C.s are leaking and there
are broken hose reels. Under the present arrangement, the headmaster makes
his request for repairs to MOE which, in turn, transmits it to MOW for action.
This procedure takes a long time and even when the request is acknowledged,
MOW may lack the funds to undertake the repair work. Urgent attendon should
be given to corrective and preventive maintenance in order to avoid premature
deterioration of the building and equipment. At least one handyman, equipped
with work bench, hand tools and a small shed, is needed at each secondary school
site to carry out minor maintenance on school buildings, dormitories and furniture.
Students in  residence  can  assist with  maintenar.ce as a part of their
extra-curricular activities. At appraisal more consideration was needed of the
establishmont of an adequate maintenance programme. There are no maintenance
manuals at the schools. PIU should correct this omiss.' ,n by preparing, for each
school, a manual comprising (i) a site plan of the school, (ii) a furniture layout
for each room, (iii) the location of switch panels and supply and drainage pipes,
(iv) a list of all equipment supplied, (v) user manuals from manufacturers of the
equipment and machinery, and (vii) directions on the maintenance of floors, walls,
timber and .paint surfaces.
Furniture and Equipment
2.17 Tenders for the supply of furniture and equipment were invited (in
accordance with ICB procedures) on lists prepared by the PIU in consultation
with MOE. The standard of furniture is generally satisfactory but the laboratory
stools are poorly designed and made. The seats are made with timber slats of
4 cm width glued together; and they are failing apart at the glued joints. At
the time of the mission, approximately 40 per cent of the stools were broken
at each school. For future projects, the PIU should keep a control sample of
all furniture against which deliveries can be checked. The equipment supplied



- 11 -
*            appears adequate for the purpose but there are some items which are not relevant
to the present curriculum. It is doubtful whether the sophisticated hot water
system to the dover stoves in the home economics kitchens will ever be used.
There was an inventory of science equipment at only one of the ten schools visited.
The headteacher/bursar of each school did not receive a master list of all
equipment and furniture ordered, as a basis for verifying the quantities supplied
and for subsequent inventory control.
Technical Assistance
2.18 As expected at appraisal, the PIU obtained specialist services to assist
with site plans, cost estimates, post-contract and construction supervision.
DANIDA, the primary source for professional services, provided two senior
architects, one architect and two supervising engineers. One shortcoming on
the part of DANIDA was its slowness in replacing its consultants, when necessary.
There was a gap of two years between the departure of one DANIDA senior
architect and the arrival of a replacement. The CFTC provided one quantity
surveyor and two architects, while the JVOC supplied two volunteer architects.
The PIU employed the services of three architectural firms for contract supervision
of eight school extensions. For supervision of the extensions to Chancellor College,
a UK based firm (the original architects for the University) was contracted.
This latter contract explained why the extensions to Chancellor Coliege were
skilfully integrated with the original buildings. Overall the services of the
consultants were satisfactory. However, the total of years of services financed
under the Project was approximately 27, instead of the 35 envisaged at appraisal
(Annex 1).
2.19 With regard to the consultancy services to assist in preparing the Education
Plan, one and a half years of technical assistance was provided instead of one
year which wLs originally envisaged (see para. 4.27).
Covenants
2.20 All covenants have been fulfilled (Annex 4). In the initial stages of project
implementation, the PIU was slow in sending to IDA the annual audits, but this
problem was subsequently overcome.

m. COSTS AND DI8BURSEMENTS
Project Casts and Finaning
3.01 The total estimated cost of the P!oject (including contingencies and taxes)
at appraisal was US$53.8 million (MK 42.7 million); and taxes were estimated
at US$2.5 Iyillion. The IDA financing of SDR 32.2 million (US$41.0 million
equivalent)-S was expected to cover 80 per cent of the total project cost net
of taxes. es implemented, the final cost of the Project was US$33.3 million
(MK 45.85p), about 38 per cent below the appraisal estimate in US dollar terms
and seven per cent above in Kwacha terms. The sum of SDR 23.9 million, 80
per cent of the actual cost, was disbursed. Considering the items added to the
Project during implementation and the deletion of one item, the cost overrun
was MK 3.1 million. Final disbursement was made on 30 October 1987 and the
sum of SDR 8,276,894.28 (26 per cent of the original Credit proceeds) was
cancelled.
3.02 A detailed comparison of appraisal estimates and actual cost by categories
and items expressed in local currency and US dollars is given in Table 3.1.

3.03 As shown in Table 3.1, three categories had cost overruns in local currency
terms (see also Annex 5), whereas in US dollar terms five categories had cost
underruns, with an overrun only in the project administration category. Although
the scope of the Project was increased by the addition of two school extensions
at a cost of MK 5.11 million, there were still overall substantial cost underruns
in US dollar terms and only seven per cent increase in local currency terms. The
differences in costs in currency terms were due to the devaluation of the Malawian
kwacha relative to the US dollar during project implementation.

Unit Costs
3.04 In terms of local currency, the actual cost per student place at secondary
schools was approximate to the appraisal estimate MK 7,232 at appraisal as against
MK 7,273 actual, with the increased price of imported materials in terms of the
devaluated kwacha offsetting the overestimate of cost. The cost per m2 was
about 12 per cent below the appraisal estimate. On the other hand, the Chancellor
College unit costs were generally only about 20% above appraised estimates,
whether in regard to square metres (18 per cent) or in regard to places (19.8 per
cent).
Disbusements
3.05 Final disbursement was made and the Credit Account closed on 30 October
1987. The sum of SDR 23,923,045.56 was disbursed out of a Credit of SDR
32,200,000.00. The rate of disbursement lagged behind appraisal estimates from
the third year of implementation (1984) onward mainly because of the devaluation
of the Malawian kwacha (Annex 6).

IV. EDUCATIONAL OUTCOMES
Overview
4.01  Overall, the objectives of the Project were achieved. The intended 4,440
places were provided by 1987/88 and enrolment in project secondary schools
increased by 4,366 (Annex 7). Actual female enrolment feU short by 5.5 per
cent. The distribution of females among the schools is, however, quite uneven.
In six schools there were vacancies in the female hostels while in some other
schools five females were put in hostel rooms designed to accommodate four.
The percentage of secondary students passing the MSCE examination has increased
in the project schools, thus providing more students qualified for post-secondary
education and training. The new facilities provided at Chancellor CoUege, in
particular for the Faculty of Education, were completed and brought into use
in 1982/82. In the teacher training programme at the Colege, enrolment increased
by 37 per cent and output by 56 per cent between 1982 and 1986.
4.02 The Education Development Plan was completed in 1985. The Plan outlines
Government policies and makes proposals for development in all aspects of
education. Twelve studies, approved by IDA, were undertaken during the project
implementation period.
Access to Secondary Eduation
4.03 The Project provided 4,440 "district day secondary" school places (Annex
7). Total enrolment in this category of schools (includin,, the project schools)
grew from about 7,400 in 1979/80 to 11,677 in 1985/86- - an increase of 58
per cent, compared, to the 50 per cent increase estimated at appraisal. Over
the same period, overal secondary school enrolment increased by 52 per cent
from 16,431 to 24,894, slightly above the appraisal estimates.
The Quality of Secondary Education
4.04 It is too early to assess the impact of the Project on the quality of education
in the secondary system as a whole or in the project schools. If student
performance on the final examination (MSCE) is used as an indication of
achievement, then all but one of the project schools have improved pass rates.
Table 4.1 shows that the number of successful students from project schools
increased from 257 in 1984 to 789 in 1987. The Project schools had a 170 per
cent increase in candidates by comparison with a 25 per cent increase overal
for Malawi. Thus the project schools are helping to expand the pool of students
available for further education and training. During the period 1984 to 1987,
the MSCE examination annual pass rate in the project schools improved from
54 per cent to 62 per cent. However, in all secondary schools the improvement
was from 56 per cent to 74 per cent. The mission was unable to review the
situation in non-project schools, but, on the face of it, there appears to be much
room for improvement in the performance of students in the project secondary
schools.
1/ Enrolment data for "district day secondary" schools were not available for
1986/87 and 1987/88.

4.05   Textbooks are in short supply in subject areas such as geography, history
and science. The Ministry of Education provided science "student books" many
of which are worn and need replacement. Students in the Home Economics areas
need textbooks which demonstrate the preparation of meals from foods which
are indigenous to Malawi. Many items of science and home economics equipment
supplied by the Project have remained unused and some are still unpacked after
two years. Teaching aids such as charts and models are virtually absent from
laboratories and classrooms. Teachers have justifiably complained of the
inadequacy of the supply of some teaching materials; however, there is little
indication of improvization by teachers. The Project might have minimized
some of these problems if it had included an in-service teacher education
component, designed to train teachers how to use the new equipment and how
to improvize when certain types of equipment/material were not available.
4.06 None of the principals at the ten schools visited had been trained in school
administration and one principal was pursuing the M.Ed course at Chancellor
College. The Ministry of Education conducts a one-week training programme
for princ:pals of secondary schools and primary teacher training colleges (TTCs)
once every two years. This period of training seems inadequate for principals



-16-
who have not otherwise been trained in school administration. Among the
shortcomings observed in school management were: a) the lack of science
equipment inventories in nine of the ten schools visited and deficiencies in
laboratory management and b) the fact that not all principals were aware that
practical classes were not being conducted in science and home economics
disciplines. A staff development programme was not evident in the schools and
few principals were aware of the staff training needs. In retrospect it is clear
that the Project design should have included in-service training for the principals
over two or three long vacation periods and also allowed for the development
of an adequate orientation programme for individuals designated to head secondary
schools.
Impact an Suidary Teasher Bducation
4.07 At appraisal it was estimated that, at full capacity, 500 students would
be enrolled in secondary teacher training programmes in the Faculty of Education,
Chancellor College (with an annual output of about 130 trained teachers - 55
from the three-year diploma programme, 55 from the five-year degree course
and 20 from the two-year upgrading courses for diploma level secondary schcol
teachers - para. 4.08). These targets were not achieved mainly because, in
response to a request by MOEC, the of Education utilized some 20 per cent of
its teacher training capacity to ino-year utroduce a diploma programme for
the training of teaching staff for the TTCs. Nevertheless, in terms of numbers,
the enrolment in the Faculty of Education .ncreased from 314 in 1982/83, when
the new facilities were completed, to 461 in 1986/87 and the output of 203 teachers
in 1986 exceeded the project target by 73. It is too early to assess adequately
the impact of the graduates on the quality of secondary education. Nevertheless,
there are indications of quantitative achievement - between 1983/84 and 1986/87,
the number of expatriate secondary teachers dacined from 292 to 261 - (a
reduction made possible by the inflow of 186 trained Malawians over the period).
4.08 Concerning the suitability of the graduates for teaching in rural schools,
the University lecturers have recognized some shortcomings, especially in
pedagogical skills. The University has proposed to MOEC the restructuring of
Faculty Programmes, r.amely replacing the Diploma in Education and the five-year
B.Ed degree programmes and by a four-year B.Ed degree programme, which
will provide adequate traininig.  The Faculty of Education has had major
difficulties trying to supervise students placed far afield for teaching practice
and at the same time to conduct lectures at the University - a problem further
aggravated by the inadequacy of transportation. One solution would have been
the co-operation of MOEC staff and MIE with the University in establishing-
field supervisory arrangements. At appraisal, the problems in this area were
not envisaged and therefore the need for reform requiring collaboration among
MIE, MOEC and the Faculty of Education was not recognized.
Studies and Evaluation
4.09 The twelve studies undertaken, with the approval of IDA, were intended
to provide MOEC with useful planning data and to offer recommendations that
would contribute towards new policies for the development of education. These
studies were:

(x)  Secondary school teacher needs: 1985/86 - 1994/95,
(xi)  A Proposal for the creation of the Malawi Institute of Management,
1986 and
(xii)  Issues in Financing of Recurrent Expenditure on Education in Malawi.
4.10 (1) Costs and Durability of Primary School Textbooks: Except for one aspect,
the study fulfils the requirements of the terms of reference. It gives a full
description of the costs of the primary school textbooks and of the problem which
arose with IDA in regard to the local publishing company. The lack of appropriate
storage facilities is identified as a major contributor to the premature destruction
of books. The indications are that the school books will not last five years under
the existing patterns of use which the Report outlines. The terms of reference,
unfortunately, did not require investigation of the suitability of the books from
the curriculum perspective and the Report did not include projections of the
annual recurrent costs for maintaining the provision of textbooks. These data
would have contributed to planning for the expansion of the textbook programme.
4.11 (ii) Primary School Attendance Survey: This study was undertaken in order
to shed light on the poor attendance patterns which existed in primary schools.
The base line information for the study was the 1979 enrolment. The survey
was undertaken in 1981 and, by the time the Report was written in 1985, it is
likely that the information was out-of-date. The Report carries an in-depth
description of school attendance patterns in the regions but does not identify
reasons for poor attendance and therefore fails short of making recommendations
fur improvement.
4.12 (iii) Chancellor College - Tracer Studies: These studies were undertaken
to determine the activities of graduates of the teacher training programmes,
and to assist in revising curricula and salary and other incentives for secondary
school teachers. The surveys were carried out in 1982, 1983 and 1984 respectively.
In the initial survey, 60 per cent of the graduates responded, but the response
rate was reduced to 43 per cent and 36 per cent in the second and third surveys
respectively. The overall response rate, therefore, limits the extent to which
the findings can be generalized for graduates, since the sample is not a truly
random sample. The study identified the following main reasons for dissatisfaction
among teachers: (a) the difference in salary of degree holders and diplomates
which is a disincentive to diplomates whose entry point on the salary scale (K1,851)



- 18 -
is much lower than that of the graduates (K3,576); (b) assigment of teachers
to teach subjects which they were not trained to teach; (c) the scarcity of
opportunities for promotion; (d) the over-burdening of some teachers and (e)
the fact that many teachers dislike teaching in rural schools. The Tracer study,
1983, indicates that some graduate teachers remained unemployed for two to
three months subsequent to their graduation, but does not offer reasons for their
unemployment. To date there is no indication that the findings of these studies
have influenced the conditions of service of teachers. The MOEC needs to
determine whether tracer studies will be utilized in its efforts to improve the
education system.
4.13 (iv) Evaluation of the Second Education Project, 1984: The evaluation
exercise, undertaken by MOEC, was in fulfilment cf a covenant of the IDA Credit
Agreement for the Fourth Education Project. The Report outlines the objectives
of the Second Education Project and indicates the extent to which they have
been achieved. It wes too early after completion of project implementation
to evaluate the impact of the Teachers' College and the model schools.
Consequently, the evaluation was carried out mainly on the physical infrastructure.
Suggestions made in the Report to provide less elaborate technical/vocational
education and to increase the utilization of the computer centre were, taken
into consideration when subsequent projects were prepared. There was some
follow-up on the recommendation to improve the design of the language laboratory
in that, at the suggestion of the users, laboratories constructed in the new teachers'
colleges have sound cubicles along the walls, leaving the centre of the room
for movable furniture. Nevertheless, problems have remained with the laboratories
in that the tutors' cubicles are wrongly positioned and there is no ceiling to reduce
the noise factor.
4.14 (v) Impact of the Increase in School Fees on Primary Enrolment in 1983:
Between 1980/81 and 1982/83, MOEC increased primary school fees by 22-28
per cent and this study, undertaken in 1985, was to determine the impact of
the higher school fees on enrolment. The Report attributes the decrease in
enrolment in Standard I classes in 1982/83 (the first decrease since 1966) to the
increase in school fees. This observation might be correct; however, the study
is limited in terms of sampling and the control of extraneous variables. The
findings are therefore restricted to the sample and a carefully designed follow-up
study would have to be undertaken to determine the potential for cost recovery
from primary schools.
4.15 (vi) Evaluation of the Primary School Self-Help Construction Programme:
Under the Third Education Project, there were two programmes for the
construction of primary schools: (a) programme fully financed by government
which was implemented mainly in urban areas and (b) a community self-help
programme implemented in rural areas. This study was intended to evaluate
the cost effectiveness of the schools in the self-help programmes for which the
communities provided bricks free of charge to the project and unskilled labour
for which MOEC paid. The evaluation focused inter alia on (a) the quality and
durability of the structures erected by the coRimmuniiities compared with that
of the other programmes and (b) the difference in costs, including hidden costs
of project administration. The study attributed the 18-month delay in
implementation of the self-help programme to the fact that this aspect was
"poorly conceived and inadequately managed" - a justified criticism. The Report
was in favour of contracting primary school buildings to "reputable contractors".



-19-
It suggested, however, that if Government continued the self-help construction
programme as an approach to building primary schools, for future projects the
(i) magnitude of the programme should be reduced to avoid overwhelming the
existing resources, (ii) a special technical unit should be established to co-ordinate
the programme, and (iii) consideration should be given to providing the basic
structure (roof and floor) and leaving the completion of the building to the school
community.
4.16   It is advisable that the Government continue to build rural primary schools
through the community self-help programme, as it allows for the integration
of MOEC and the community in providing school buildings and lessens the
tendencies towards school vandalism which is becoming a problem in Malawi.
However, as the study recommended, In order for the programme to be efficiently
implemented, its scope, organization and management need to be changed.
4.17 (vii) Secondary School Development Guidelines - The Question of Boarding
Schools in Malawi, 1986: The main objective of the study was to determine the
feasibility of establishing non-residential secondary schools. At the time of
the completion mission, the first draft of the study had been completed and was
being revised by MOEC. The study contains a wealth of interesting information;
however, its organization and presentation could be strengthened. The study
compares costs and academic performance of students in the various types of
secondary schools - government boarding, government day, aided boarding and
aided day. ft undertakes a population analysis and recommends the threshold
population required to sustain schools of various sizes. It proposes that a 160-place
day secondary school is the minimum size capable of generating economies of
scale; however, it does not discuss whether these schools can economically offer
the sciences and practical areas at a level comparable to the larger secondary
schools. This study accepts that boarding schools will continue to be necessary
in Malawi, but that MOEC will need to chcnge its policies so that students who
live within walking distance from the school can be non-residents.
4.18 (viii) Secondary Teacher Education Programme in Malawi, 1985. Overall,
this study gives a comprehensive view of the organization and content of the
teacher training programmes of the University, identifies problems relating to
the: a) long duration (five years) of the Bachelor of Education (B.Ed) programmes,
b) shortage of personnel for supervising teaching practice, and c) low calibre
of students who are selected for teacher training in science and mathematics
education. The Report recommends: (a) reducing the duration of the B.Ed.
programme to four years, (b) closer collaboration among the University, MIE
and MOEC so as to alleviate many of the problems of supervising teaching
practice, and (c) strategies by which MOEC and the University together can
improve the quality of science and mathematics education.
4.19  In order to show that some of the problems of secondary school teaching
are outside the scope of teacher training, the study analyses the conditions of
service of teachers. Some of the anomalies identified include (a) the "wide gap"
between the entry point on the salary scale for diplomates and graduates, (b)
the disparity in teaching loads, and (c) poor personnel relations. The Report
recommends the establishment of a Teaching Service Commission to see to appointments,
promotions and training awards in the teaching service. The University, in
conjunction with MOEC, should review the recommendations of this study, many
of which are realistic and, if implemented, will alleviate some of the problems
of teacher education.

4.20 (ix) The Costs and Efficiency of University and other Post-Primary Educa.ion
in Malawi, 1982-1983: This study was intended to provide baseline data for t.-e
preparation of the National Educational Development Plan. Accordingly, it is
comprehensive and gives a detailed analysis of costs and efficiency in educational
ins.itutions. The Report includes supporting tables showing disagegated costs
and compares overall costs with other African countries suich as Kenya and
Tanzania. The economic efficiency of the system is discussed in terms of
staff:student ratios, costs per graduate and space utilization. Recommendations
offered are on the whole realistic and some can be implemented in the medium
and long term at little additional cost. The Report does not discuss one item
important for educational planning - the likely impact of efficiency measures
on the quality of education. This omission, however, was a shortcoming of the
terms of reference.
4.21 (x) Secondary School Teacher Needs : 1985/86 - 1994/95: This study was
intended to inform MOEC as to the qualifications and numbers of teachers needed
for the development of secondary education. The Report provides data on the
present number of teachers in the system and the shortfall and surplus by subject
areas. On the basis of the Education Development Plan, the study projects supply
and demand for teachers. Its most important finding concerns the deployment
of teaching staff - that 269 teachers are teaching subjects which they were not
trained to teach. MOEC should follow up on this finding, especially as some
field education officers have expressed dissatisfaction with the performance
of secondary school teachers.
4.22 (xi) A proposal for the creation of the Malawi Institute of Management
(MIM), 1986: This study was undertaken in response to a Government request
for assistance to establish the Malawi Institute of Management (MIM). This
Institute is being planned to provide training in managerial skills for middle and
higher level managers in the civil service, parastatals and private firms. The
Report confirms the need for management training in Malawi and proposes that
the Institute:
(a)    provide short term training programmes which will focus on the managerial
and personnel needs of the Malawian workplace;
(b)    provide management consultancy services to the Malawian Government
Ministries and Departments, Statutory Boards and Corporations and private
sector firms;
(c)    have a residential staff of approximately nine persons, six of whom will
be expatriates;
(d)    be located in Lilongwe approximately 16 kilometres from the City centre.
The Report recommends a wide range of training programmes including personnel
management, communication, policy formation and analysis, performance auditing
and project management and that MIM provide consulting services to firms wishing
to improve their organizational efficiency.
4.23   Although this study is comprehensive and addresses some key areas
regarding the development of a management institution, there are some issues
which have been left unresolved. The aim of relating training closely to the
workplace would suggest that a plan is needed so achieve ful nationalization
of staff as soon as possible, certainly within five years, even though some short



- 21 -
term  consultants from outside may be needed. The Report does not describe
and analyse the market for such an Institute. It is expected that the Institute
will receive approximately 79 per cent of its revenue from Government budget
but it is not expected that it will be financialy viable. There is mention of
collaboration with the management centre at the Polytechnic, but this relationship,
below the level of board membership, will be of "an informal nature". If this
relationship is not structured in the planning stages, there is likely to be duplication
and waste of resources during operation.
4.24 It is unlikely that the Institute will be capable of maintaining a first
class hotel facility. Consequently, consideration shoudd be given to having such
accommodation managed as an independent entity on a commercial basis with
the training/conference centre having priority in the use of its services. In this
way, the hotel complex could more advantageously be located away from the
training centre Pethough in proximity. Overall, the Report does not present
alternative strategies and related costs for training managers in Malawi.
4.25 (xii) Issues in Financing of Recurrent Expenditure on Education in Malawi:
This study was undertaken to determine the imbalance in education recurrent
expenditure among the various levels of education. The Report describes the
pattern of recurrent financing and the costs of future provision fcr education
and makes comparisons between the secondary and primary sub-sectors. The
study estimates the cost per graduate of regular secondary school (K 549), night
school (K 650) and the Malawi Correspondence Distance Education (MCDE)
programme (K1,086) and, therefore, draws attention to the competition for funds
between relatively efficient day schools and the relatively inefficient MCDE
programme. Introduction of the shift system is recommended in the study but
there is no discussion of the supporting sub-system which will make a shift system
function effectively.
4.26   General Conclusion. Despite the shortcomings of some studies, this
component of the Project was fairly well implemented. The number of studies
undertaken was the direct result of having a studies co-ordinator with two research
assistants and an economist posted in the Planning Unit. Of the 12 studies carried
out, three only were undertaken by foreign consultants, three by local consultants
and the remaining six were carried out under the supervision of the studies
co-ordinator. The establishment of a research unit was a commendable effort,
on the part of MOEC and IDA staff, towards improving the standard of educational
research in MOEC.
Bducaton DeRvelopment Plan (1985 to 1995)
4.27   According to the Credit Agreement, the National Education Plan was
intended to guide the development of Malawi education and training systems
up to 1990 - later extended to 1995. The agreed completion date was December
1982. The plan was ,-ventually completed in 1985; this delay was due in part
to a six-month delay in recruiting the consultant and, in part, to the fact that
the original timetable was unrealistic.



- 22 -
4.28   The Government of Malawi and IDA staff envisaged that the Plan would
primarily (a) review and summarize the progress made in education, (b) focus
on the need for trained manpower, (c) address "teacher needs", (d) project growth
and change in the education system up to 1995, and (e) assess the financial
implications of growth of the education system. The Plan was expected to
comprise mainly two parts (a) those aspects of education under direct control
of MOEC to be undertaken by a studies co-ordinator which was provided to MOEC
by UNDP, and (b) those aspects of education that were under the aegis of the
other Government departments.
4.29   The Plan covers all levels of the education system and projects enrolment
expansion, output and costs and financing on the basis of stated Government
policies for education development. However, a few are s of concern are worth
noting. There is no evidence that a comprehensive study was undertaken showing
the status of education in Malawi, its historical performance and potential for
growth in the light of the economic changes. Some studies intended to provide
data for the Plan were undertaken almost simultaneously with its preparation
and were therefore of limited usefulness as a basis for the Plan. Finally, the
Plan assumes much more favourable financial trends than appear to be justified.
Nevertheless, the Plan provides a good base for education planners in MOEC
and it is for them to undertake the necessary revisions and organize the areas
in order of priority for implementation in the medium and long term, particularly
in the light of findings of the studies undertaken under the Project. The Plan
also provides a suitable basis for discussion of projects and instruments between
the Governmant and the donor community.

V. IDA PERFORMANCE
5.01 The Fourth Education Project was generated over a period of two years.
Its emphasis on the development of secondary education was directly related
to the manpower demand for trained personnel for middle and higher level jobs.
The inclusion of a teacher training component was intended to ensure a supply
of teachers for the secondary education expansion programme. In these respects
the appraisal was well conducted.
5.02 After 20 years (1967-87) of implementing IDA financed projects, Malawi
does not have a local permanent implementation capacity. This deficiency must
be regarded as the principal weakness in the design of the Fourth and earlier
Education Projects. The Fourth Project shoudd have included provision for bringing
about a rapid end to Malawi's dependence on expatriate services for implementing
education projects. A staff development plan for the PIU should have been put
in place and policy changes needed to have been recommended to allow the PIU
to recruit and retain highly skilled staff.
5.03 An in-service training component was needed in the area of school
administration and management, utilization of the new equipment and maintenance
of school buildings and furniture, and a more indepth analysis of the qualitative
aspect of the secondary school programme was needed. Some problems
experienced with the supervision of teacher trainees would have been alleviated
if, at appraisal, the importance of closer collaboration among MIE, MOEC and
the University of Malawi had been explored.
5.04 Supervision by IDA was generally good. Shortcomings of the standard
architectural design were evident after the structural work of the first school
was completed or nearing completion (even if not clearly before). The failure
of the IDA to review thoroughly the designs in the early stages and to advise
on corrective measures after the programme was underway has to be seen as
a deficiency. To some extent, the review of the appropriateness of the equipment
and books to be supplied to the project schools needed also to have been more
thorough.
5.05 IDA recognized the need for educational research in Malawi and approved
approximately twelve educational studies. Many of these studies provided
information and recommendations which were incorporated in the Fifth and Sixth
Education Projects. The quality of the studies can be improved if the researchers
are better briefed as to the purpose of the research, and the terms of reference
written so that there is no ambiguity about the scope and focus of the study.

VI. LESSON8 AND EXPERIENCE GAINED
Experience with the Project highlights the importance of:
1.   close review of architectural plans to ensure economy and suitability to
local conditions (para. 2.08),
2.   verifying at the planning stage, the availability of building materials (in
this case bricks and aggregates) in areas where the supplies will be purchased
from the village communities (para. 2.14),
3.   taking measures to build up local project management capacity (para. 2.06),
4.   involving end users in the building design stage and equipment selection,
and providing inventories of equipment supplied to schools (paras 2.11,
4.13),
5.   establishing a programme of training in the maintenance of buildings,
furniture and equipment and providing the means necessary for such
maintenance (para. 2.16),
6.   making provisicn for an in-service teacher training programme in the use
of new teaching equipment supplied under the Project (para. 4.05).
7.   Establishing training for principals in school management (para. 4.06)
especially where qualitative and organizational changes to the school
programmes are expected as a result of the project investment.
