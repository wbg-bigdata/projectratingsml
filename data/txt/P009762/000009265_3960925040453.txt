KFPAIA (Cr. 1028-TNI. MAHARASHTRA (Cr. 1135-IN) AND TAMfL
NADU iCr. 1137-IN) AGRICULTtMAL EXTENSION PROJECTS
PROJTECT C MLTTON REPORTS
overview
1.         This overview, prepared by the Asia Regional staff,
complements the three Project Completion Reports dealing with the
above operations. The projects were successful in establishing the
basic structure for improved extension services.  Further
institutional, administrative, and policy reforms are needed in the
participating states (Maharashtra, Kerala, and Tamil Nadu) to make
their extension services more efficient and effective in keeping
the changing needs of the farmers. The overview outlines a number
of key adjustments for long term development of extension in these
states.
Reorganizing Extension
2.         Since mid-1970s, the Bank has assisted GOI to reorganize
its agricultural extension services which were fragmented and weak.
The restructuring of extension was based on the T&V approach.
This approach was designed to ensure regular contact with the
farmers, regular training of the Village Extension Workers (VEW)
and Subject Matter Specialists (SMS), close supervision of field
workers, and reqular feedback to researchers to solve field
problems in order to improve farm productivity and farm incomes.
The aim was to establish a professional advisory service staffed by
well qualified, closely supervised field workers--fully supported
by technical specialists--who would disseminate relevant, up-to-
date technical information to cultivators.
3.         The initial projects were designed to establish the
basic organizational structure and put in place the required
manpower for extension services. In the early years, to keep
management simple and to allow extension to be established and
accepted by the farmers, technology transfer was focussed on
selected major crops (cereals, pulses, and oilseeds). This was
consonant with GOI's policy at that time to attain self sufficiency
in foodgrain production. It was, however, intended that
agricultural extension services would eventually cover all on-farm
land based activities. The investment program during this first
phase of extension development required high capital expenditures
(civil works, vehicles, and equipment), with high incremental costs
because of substantial expansion of manpower.
4.         As part of this first phase development, the above three
projects were designed to restructure extpnsion services on a state



- ix -
wide basis and to establish the basic organizational structure of a
professional extension system in each of the participating states.
Pnje$t T1_1      nt
5.         Project objectives were achieved under the above
projects which were completed on time as expected at appraisal.
With the support provided under the Bank financed projects, the
basic organizational structure of the reformed extension system,
including the hiring of the core staff and the linkage with
research, has been established in Maharashtra, Kerala and Tamil
Nadu.  The establishment of the reformed extension  systam has
improved the quality of extension services in the states.
Generally, the introduction of professional extension services has
been well received in the states, the T&V methodology has been
accepted by staff and farmers, and the morale of VEWs has improved
as they have gained confidence in their ability to assist farmers.
Farmers are accepting the technical advice of extension workers
and adopting the recommended practices to improve farm
productivity. This in turn has led to changes in the cropping
patterns, to yield increases, and to increased use of inputs, even.
though monitoring surveys have reported some irregularity in VEW
visits and the failure of some farmers to adopt certain recommended
crops and farming practises. The extension system is also
coordinating to some extent with other support services to provide
better research, inputs, water and power services to farmers.
6.         Since the projects dealt with significant institutional
reforms to restructure extension services, project start-up in
each case was fairly slow. The recruitment of staff was difficult
in the initial period. The agricultural colleges were turning out
a limited number of agricultural graduates each year. The projects
also encountered some difficulties in transferring staff from other
departments to the Department of Agriculture. The posting of staff
to remote locations was also troublesome. The lesson from this is
that in projects where transfers of staff are involved it is
important to reach agreement at an early stage with the Departments
and staff concerned on the implementation arrangements. Another
problem encountered during implementation was delays in the civil
works component which were due to inadequate budgetary provisions
in the early years, difficulties in site selections, shortages of
cement and low priority by the implementing agency (PWD). The
extension program in these states is still hampered by: (a) weak
extension planning and management; (b) inadequately trained staff
especially subject matter specialists (SMS); and (c) inadequate
budgetary provision and delayed sanction of funds, in recent years,
for investments and recurrent expenditures. Insufficient operating
expenditures have at times seriously disrupted the regularity of
farm visits, staff training and supervision, and adaptive research.
Further Reforms for Extension
7.         While a lot of progress has been made in providing
improved extension to farmers, further changes are now necessary to
improve the management, operational efficiency and quality of
extension services.  To facilitate prompter adaption to changing
needs and emerging national priorities, extension services must
become more flexible and efficient. The farmers who are becoming



more commercially oriented, now demand a broad range of advise on
(a) all farm enterprises and farming activities: (b) improved
farming technologies suitable to local conditions: (c) services
available for inpits, credit and marketing: and (d) methods to
improve farm management in order to increase farm income. The
staff of the future extension service must therefore have the
knowledge and expertise to discuss options for resource allocatior
and to carry out basic farm budget analysis with the farmers.
8.         Extension is now at an important crossroads:  The
present approach to providing extension support to farmers is
fragmented and lacks coordination among the natural resource line
departments, and encourages development of costly, parallel
extension services. Timely institutional and administrative
reforms could integrate all land-based extension activities
currently supported by several line departments, and make extension
more efficient, flexible and cost-effective.
9.         The key areas -in which further reforms are needed are
outlined below:
(a) Broadening the coverage of extension services to
cover all land based farm activities (horticulture,
animal husbandry, fodder production, soil and
moisture conservation, water management, farm
forestry, etc.);
(b)  Strengthening of technical and management quality
of extension (including staff deployment,
recruitment policies, promotion prospects and
incentives, and communication methods );
(c) Strengthening extension to cater to the needs of
women involved in farming;
(d) Improving the research-extension linkage:
(d) Rationalizing centrally and state funded extension
programs that duplicate the function of DOA
extension services; and
(e) Improving planning and funding of the agricultural
extension services.
10.        The above reforms would not involve significant capital
expenditures or incremental costs. However, continued Bank support
is considered very important since it would strengthen the hands of
those for continued reform to improve the performance of the
extension service. If the reforms are not undertaken in a timely
manner the effectiveness of the existing extension system could
decline, and such a trend could lead to a progressive weakening of
the professional extension services in the states.
11.        The sustainability of the improved extension system will
depend on the capability of the extension service to understand
farmers' problems and solve them within the confines of their



- xi -
means. Moreover, sustainability would also be enhanced by the
implementation of significant institutional, administrative, and
policy reforms in the areas outlined above. The establishment of a
more efficient system, responding to the changing demands of
agriculture, would receive strong support from the farming
community and from key agencies within the government (Finance,
Planning), as it would not require any significant increase in
budgetary outlays.

KERALA AMRIC!LTOURI EXTENS ON PROJECT

ROQJECT COMPLETION REPORT
Evaluation Summa;Z
Introduction
1.         The Kerala Agricultural Extension Project was executed
between 1980 and 1986. The project was intended to finance the
reorganization and strengthening of the Department of Agriculture
(DOA) extension service based on the T&V approach. The Credit
closed on time in June 1986. Total project cost, estimated at
appraisal at US$ 15.3 M was supported by an IDA Credit of USS 10.0
M. The total credit amount has been disbursed.
ProieCt Objectives and Ratinnale
2.         The project intended to support the reorganization and
strengthening of the DOA extension service, aimed at establishing a
single line of command from the Director of Agriculture to the
Village Extension Workers (VEWs) through: consolidating staff from
special crop schemes into a unified extension service: hiring
additional staff; establishing the T&V methodology of extension;
supporting a variety of training programs; providing vehicles for
the different levels of staff; constructing staff housing; and
meeting other incremental costs of the DOA, including those for
setting up a monitoring and evaluation unit. Through improvements
in the extension service it was expected that agricultural
productivity and farm incomes would increase over time.
Proiect Iolementation. Results and Sustainability
3.         The project has generally been successful in
establishing a framework for a professional agricultural extension
in the state (away from the diffused system of multipurpose workers
and numerous crop schemes). Though there were delays in startup of
the project, staffing (scarcity of qualified staff, staff from
other departments refusing to transfer, etc), AEO staff assigned
dual responsibility (operating input supply centers), provision of
staff transport (too low loan cielings and travel allowances), the
civil works component (slow land aquisition) and insufficient
release of budgetary funds in the early years, the project was
implemented largely as envisaged at appraisal. The training and
M&E components were especially well implemented.
4.         By the end of the project most staff had been appointed
and data from M&E surveys in 1986/87 show that on average 21% of
the farmers in Kerala were being visited by the VEWs. (57% of the
contact farmers received two, and another 20% one visit permonth.



- 2-
In addition about 6% of the non-contact farmers were visited twice-
and 15% once in a month). The practises recommended by the VEWs
are being adopted and this in turn has led to increased use of
inputs and higher yields in the case of paddy, cardamom and banana.
It is still too early to assess the project's overall impact on
productivity. The long term effect of the project is expected to be
positive and lead to increasingly higher rates of adoption of new
technologies. The momentum and gain achieved will, however,
require a continued conmittment to the program from higher level
officals of the state government and management improvement to
ensure the motivation of staff at the field level. Moreover, the
sustainability of the improved extension system would be enhanced
by the implementation of further institutional, administrative, and
policy reforms as outlined in paras 7-9 of the PCR Overview.
F     eindina  and tggonn
5.         The main lessons that emerge from the project are: (a)
constitution of a Steering Committee with the Chief Secretary as
chairman and the most senior officials of concerned Departments as
members, once it was established in 1984 by the Government, ensured
adequate allocation and release of funds for the project which was
earlier a problem; (b) commitment and effective field level
supervision by middle and senior level staff is of crucial
importance; (c) staff should not be assigned non-extension work (d)
travel allowances and loan ceilings for vehicle purchase need to be
high enough to ensure staff mobility (mopeds should also be
included since they are preferred to bicycles); (e) there is
concern that extension activities are too heavily biased to contact
farmers and it is suggested that the contact farmer approach be
complemented by use of voluntary organizations at the rural level
or visits to informal farmer groups, and use of media; (f) messages
should cover more than crops, take into account local practises and
put significantly more emphasis on the financial impact of adopting
a particular recommendation; (g) visits should be scheduled
according to need (i.e. areas with tree crops only require a lower
frequency of visits than areas with annual crops); and (f)
constructing staff housing is not a priority in Kerala as it is
financially more attractive for staff not to live in government
housing and many field staff prefer to live with their families.

INDIA
KERALA AGRICULTURAL EXTENSION PROJECT
(Credit 1028-IN)
PROJECT COMPLETION REPORT
I. INTROOUCTION
l.t      In the mid 1970s, the Government of India  (GOI)  as  part  of  its
national agricultural development policy, accepted the need to reorganize
the various States extension services to provide farmers with up to date
advice on farming practices best suited to their specific conditions, on a
regular and systematic basis. In line with this and supported by the World
8ank,   GOI   initiated   a  programme  of  reorganizing  and  strengthening
agricultural extension in the various States of India through a series of
IDA assisted projects. The basic thrust of these projects was aimed at
encouraging the adoption of the Training and Visit (T&V) system of
agricultural extension by the respective State governments.
1.2      The  Kerala  Agricultural  Extension  Project,  the subject of this
Project Completion Report, was the eighth in this series of IDA supported
projects.   1/   This  proJect,  appraised  in  1979/80,  provided  for  the
reorganization of the prevailing extension system in Kerala (which was based
on several special crop schemes under the Oepartment of Agriculture, and a
network  of  multipurpose  Village  Level  Workers   under   the   Community
Development   Oepartment),  into  a  unified  extension  service  under  the
Oepartment of Agriculture, with a single line of command between full-time
village extension workers and extension headquarters. It also provided for
an extensive programme of regular in-service training, and improved linkages
between agricultural research and extension. Under the State's Agricultural
Production Commissioner (APC), responsibility to implement the project lay
with the Director, OOA, with support from the Kerala Agricultural University
in implementing the training component and for providing the necessary
research support for extension. A Project Coordination Committee, under the
APC, was set up to coordinate the project's extension, research and other
related activities.
11 The seven previous projects were the following: Assam Agricultural
O Development Project (Cr. 728-IN) 1977, West Bengal Agricultural
Extension and Research Project (Cr. 690-IN) 1977, Rajasthan Agricultural
Extension and Research Project (Cr. 737-IN) 1978, Madhya Pradesh
Agricultural Extension and Research Project (Cr. 712-IN) 1977, Bihar
Agricultural Extension and Research Project (Cr. 761-1N) 1978, Orissa
Agricultural Oevelopment Project (Cr. 682-IN) 1977, and the Composite
Agricultural Extension and Research Project (Haryana, Gujarat and
Karnataka) (Cr. 862-IN) 1979.

1.3      A draft PCR prepared by BOA in June 1987, together with  additional
information provided by the department to an FAO/CP mission which visited
Kerala between 2-9 July 1987, provide the basis for this PCR. In addition,
this report is based on a review of the World Sank Staff Appraisal Report
(SAR No. 2863-IN); the Development Credit Agreement and Loan Agreement both
dated 25 June 1980; World Sank Supervision reports and project files; and
field visits and discussions with OOA and KAU staff und farmers.
II. PROJECT FORMULATION
Project Preearation
2.1      As  a  continuation  of  the  effort  to  reorganize and strengthen
agricultural extension and research activities in India, the World  Bank  in
consultation with GOI considered in early 1979, the possibility of a Second
Composite Agricultural Extension Project (as a follow  up  to  Cr.  862-IN).
Such  a  project was expected to cover the States of Kerala, Andhra Pradesh,
and Maharashtra. Government of Kerala (GOK) officials had expressed interest
In adopting the T&V approach to extension to an IDA mission in January 1979;
approval for this was given by a sub-committee of the State Cabinet in March
1979. However, the other two States were unable to take a formal decision to
participate in the proposed project; consequently, the project addressed the
requirements only for the State of Kerala.
2.2      The  process:of preparing the project followed the approach adopted
for earlier extension projects in other States of India, with the State
Government being responsible for preparing the project with support from
staff of the World Bank's New Delhi Office (NCO). The preparation report was
completed by the Government of Kerala in June 1979, based on earlier drafts
amended in line with comments received from NOO staff during a series of
discussions with GOK staff and visits to the State during the project
preparation  stage.  The  focus  of  preparation   was   on   the   proposed
reorganization of the Department of Agriculture, staffing levels, and the
integration of extension activities then carried out by village level
workers (VIW) of the Community Development Department (COD).
Aporaisal
2.3      The  initial  appraisal  of  the project took place in August 1979,
when a three person IDA mission visited the State. While the essential
features of the project were largely agreed during this visit, discussions
continued between NCO and GOK on staff numbers, including the number of VLWs
to be transferred from COD to DOA. Follow-up visits by IDA were made in
December 1979, when staffing details were largely finalised.
2.4      Ouring and after appraisal, the principal issues which needed to be
resolved, related to the total number of Village Extension Workers (VEWs) to
be deployed under the new extension system, and agreement on the number of
VLWs to be transfered from the Community Oevelopment Department to OOA.
While IDA was of the view that around 2,100-2,400 VEWs would be adequate for
Kerala's corditions, GOK proposed a level of 1,952 VEWs. While accepting
that there was no precise say to determine the "right" number of field



-5-
staff, IDA felt that the proposal might spread the VEWs too thinly. To
resolve the issue, it was agreed that a physical contingency equivalent to
the cost of 250 additional VEWs would be provided, which would be used on
the basis of a review after two years of project implementation. As regards
the transfer of VLWs to the DOA, the issue concerned the number of existing
VLWs who would be willing to be transferred from the COO, even with adequate
protection of their acquired service benefits. Prior to negotiations, GOK
approved the transfer of 172 VLWs to the OOA, to work exclusively as Village
Extension Workers under the project.
Project Oescrintion
2.5      The appraised project supported the reorganization of the extension
service of OOA, aimed at establishing a single line of command from the
Director of Agriculture to full-time Village Extension Workers (VEWs);
consolidating staff from special crop schemes into a unified extension
service; introducing a system of regular in-service training as an integral
part of extension activities, and a systematic framework for regular and
frequent visits by VEWs to farmers' fields; improving the working linkages
between extension operations and agricultural research activities; and
developing regular monitoring and evaluation procedures.
2.6      The project provided for:
a) recruiting additional staff (630 VEWs, 110 sub-divisional subject
matter  specialists,  11  assistant   sub-divisional   agricultural
officers,   36  sub-divisional  agricultural  officers  (SOAG),  13
district SMS, 9 principal agricultural officers, and 4 headquarters
SMS) to achieve staffing patterns in accordance with T&V norms;
b) supporting   a  variety  of  in-service  and  pre-service  training
programmes  for  buth  new  and  existing  staff,  which   included
orientation, seasonal, foundation, and special short courses, and
scholarships for advanced training of selected staff;
c) constructing 488 houses for VEWs and 94 for Agricultural Extension
Officers (AEO);
d) purchasing vehicles (for the different levels of staff) and
equipment. Loans were to be provided to VEWs to purchase bicycles,
and to AEOs and SMSs to purchase scooters and motorcycles; and
e) meeting OOAs incremental operating costs, including those for
setting up a monitoring and evaluation (M&E) unit.
Total costs of the project. over a five year implementation period, were
estimated at Rs128.4 million (US$15.3 million).
2.7      At OOA headquarters, under the Director of Agriculture, the project
provided for redesignating the three existing Additional Oirectors of
Agriculture (AOA) responsibilities as being for Extension, Input Supply and
Logistics, and Planning, Monitoring and Evaluation respectively. The AOA
(Extension) was to be responsible for the day to day operations and
management of the extension service, both technically and administratively.
He was to be provided a technical. support staff of 8 SMS at headquarters
(for   paddy   production/farm   management,  pulses/agronomy,  coconut  and
arecanut, cashews and horticulture, plant protection, spices and cocoa,



-6-
adaptive research and training, and water management). The 11 districts of
the State (each headed by a Principal Agricultural Officer, supported by a 3
member SMS team) were divided at field level into a total of 36 sub-
divisions (each headed by an SOAO and a 4 member SMS team), and 378
agricultural extension circles (headed by an Agricultural Extension Officer)
each responsible for supervising between 5-8 VEWs each. To carry out non-
extension activities (input supply, logistics and regulatory functions),
there were to be 125 Agricultural Development Units/Circles (each staffed by
a Junior Agricultural Officer and 2 Agricultural Demonstrators).
2.8      The training component of the project was to be implemented jointly
by OOA and the Kerala Agricultural University (KAU). Strengthening of
arrangements for close research and extension coordination between KAU and
OOA were to be promoted through State and District level technical
comittees and zonal workshops.
Negotiations and Credit Effectiveness
2.9      The  negotiations between GOI and IDA took place during April 1980.
The Bank's Board of Director approved the proposed IOA Credit of USS10
million on 1 May 1980, and it was signed on 25 June 1980. The Credit became
effective on 18 August 1980.
III. PROJECT IMPLEMENTATION
Project Start-Up
3.1      Although  the proposed extension programme was expected to start by
July 1980, various factors contributed to a significant delay in the actual
commencement of field activities. These included:
a) a change in officers at decision making levels (APC, Secretary of
Agriculture, Oirector of Agriculture) in the second half of 1980,
with the new team wishing to review the overall staffing proposals
(and in particular the provision of SMS at sub-division level)
under the project, and the proposed project phasing;
b) disagreement with the proposed drastic reduction in input supply
units (the SAR proposed 125 agricultural development units as
opposed to the 549 in operation prior to the project), since GOK
felt  that  the  prevailing  arrangements  for  supplying   inputs,
particularly seed and seedlings may get disturbed;
c) objections raised by junior level staff on there being inadequate
-        prootional opportunities  snder the project.



-7-
On  account of the above factors, the Government Orders santioning the start
of the project (in 3 districts, as opposed to the 4 proposed for year I in
the SAR) were only issued in January 1981. Actual implementation in these
first 3 districts (Trivandrum, Quilon and Allepey) did not begin until April
1981, with regular field visits and training beginning in June/July 1981.
Revisions to Project Design
3.2      The  principal change in project design was in its phasing. Instead
of the districts being phased over a 3 year period to cover the whole State
(with 4 districts each to be covered In 1981/82 and 1982/83 and 3 in
1983/84), the programme started in 3 districts 1981, with the remaining
districts being brought under the new extension system in 1982/83. 1/ Also,
instead of reducing the numbe!r of Agricultural Oevelopment Units to T25, GOK
decided to have 378 units (coterminus with the extension circles) each
manned by a Junior Agricultural Officer (JAO) and two supporting staff.
Finally, the 172 VLWs ordered to be transferred to OOA refused to do so, and
OOA had to recruit an additional 172 VEWs.
Implementation of Specific Components
3.3      Extension. The main problems encountered in  the  establishment  of
the T&V system of extension were in staffing and staff transport. During the
initial years, a full complement of field staff were not deployed in the 3
districts where the project was in operation. The initial Government Order
initiating the project in 3 districts authorised fewer SMS positions (as
compared to SAR proposals): 2 instead of 4 in each subdivision, 2 instead of
3 in each district, and 2 as compared to 8 proposed at headquarters (HQ).
The delayed appointment of HQ staff and the full complement of SMS
unavoidably delayed initial preparatory works such as demarcation of yEW
circles and the establishment of a properly organised training and visit
system. More serious staffing problems were encountered later in Oecember
1982, when the order was given to implement the project in all the remaining
districts simultaneously (with the full complement of staff as proposed in
the SAR). Oelays were experienced in recruitment, since all civil service
appointments had to be made through the Kerala State Public Service
Commission (PSC). Given the large intake necessary, the PSC was unable to
recruit at the rate required to fill all posts. At the field level delays in
PSC appointment of VEW were overcome by the appointment of temporary staff
(for 6 months at a time), and OOA tried to maintain continuity by re-
appointments. In the AEO positions, however, shortages were unavoidable
because of the limited number of graduates coming out of the Universities.
Newly appointed Junior Agriculturki officers (JAO) were assigned, on
appointment, first to extension activities as AEOs (JAO grade 1I) before
promotion to JAO grade I for the agricultural development unit activities.
In many cases AEOs were assigned dual responsibility and this diluted their
effectiveness in supervising the extension work of VEWs.
1/ At appraisal there were 11 districts, which have since been re-
demarcated. At present, the State is divtded into 14 districts-
The       number of sub-divisions and extersinn circles however, remains
unchanged.



-8-
3.4      Shortages in the AEO grade  were  further  aggravated  by  frequent
transfers, as well as by instances where staff took leave of absence when
posted to districts they did not like. By the end of the project however,
most of the staff proposed at appraisal had been appointed with the
exception of 65 AEO positions (i.e. a shortfall of 17% of the appraisal
target, see Tables 3 and 4).
3.5      Traininq.  roe comprehensive training component, involving a series
of pre-service,  in-service,  pre-season,  promotional  and  other  training
programnes were extremely well managed by KAU. Table 5 shows the main types
of courses and numbers trained. With the exception of the promotional
courses, the training programme encountered few significant problems. At
appraisal two promotional courses were provided as incentives for staff.
Provision was made for about one VEW per district per year for a four year
B.Sc course and for one SMS and one AEO per district for 2 year M.Sc
courses. 8y the end of the project only 8 (as compared to 59 proposed at
appraisal) had been deputed for B.Sc courses, and 73 officers out of the
proposed 100 had been deputed for M.Sc courses. Various factors were
responsible for the very low intake of VEWs into KAU. Firstly, KAU assigned
only 2 places a year for B.Sc degrees and 8 places for M.Sc degrees to OQA
staff.  Secondly  VEWs   did   not   have   the   necessary   pre-university
qualifications and KAU had to organise introductory courses for such
candidates,  for  which  they  had  limited  facilities   and   staff.   The
implementation   of   the  non-institutional  training  programmes  such  as
fortnightly training of VEWs and workshops needed considerable guidance from
IDA supervision missions, as there was little prior experience in the State
in conducting such training/workshops. However, they continued to improve
every year to the satisfaction of supervision missions. On the whole t,e
training courses have played an important role in upgrading staff technica'
knowledge, self-confldence and communication ability.
3.6      Civil Works.  At appraisal, provision was made for constructing :88
houses for VEWs and 94 for AEOs. No provision was made for the purchase :'
land on the understahding that it would be provided free by the State, loca'
authorities or private individuals. OOA was very slow in soliciting la-:
from these sources. Further delays were encountered due to the limited ffos
allocated for the purpose in the State Government budget. Significa-t
progress in site allocations was made only during 1983/84 and then it oecae
evident that the large construction programme could not Le undertaken sole',
by DOA's engineering unit. It was decided to apportion a considerable 2art
of the construction programme to the Public Works Department (PWO) to scee:
up the works. Actual construction therefore started in 1984/85, and -e
progress made towards completing the programme by the end of the project -as
commendable.   At  project  closing,  555  houses  hao  been  complete:    '
constructed by OOA and 485 by PWO), with 10 more being  completed  by  :,
1987. The present occupancy rate of these houses is very low at arouna 32t.
principally due to: a) some houses still needing to be supplied ' t-
amenities such as electricity and water; b) field staff preferring to ' .
with their families, particularly in the southern districts; and c) it s
financially more attractive not to live in Government housing because of ^e
loss of housing allowance combined with having to pay house rent l:
Government rates.
3.7      Vehicles  and Equipment.  While there were budgetary constraints
the first three years of the project, by the time the project clcsed, -cs:
of the items under this component were procured. However, problems "c,e
encountered in getting staff to purchase transport provided under t,e
project, through staff loans. Demand for loans to purchase motorcycles a"c
bicycles was very low until the final stages of project implementat':"



- 9-
because: a) the limits set fOr such loans were low in compaiuison with the
cost of the vehicles, and b) the travel allowances paid were financially
unattractive. When finally in February 1986 GOK increased the ceiling for
loans to RslS,000 for motorcycles, RslO,000 for scooters and Rs4,000 for
mopeds, there was a sudden increase in the demand for such loans. By the end
of the project, 429 mechanised transport (motorcycles, scooters, mopeds) had
been purchased on loan by staff (11 of these by M&E Unit staff), as against
the appraisal estimate of 375. Loans were however made for only 60 bicycles
out of the appraisal estimate of 1,560 because a) a very large proportion of
VEWs (for whom the bicycles were meant) were women, who would not ride
bicycles, and b) extension staff generally preferred mechanised transport.
Of the 489 loans approved (429 mechanised transport and 60 bicycles), 375
were for VEWs.
3.8      Monitoring  and Evaluation.  The Monitoring & Evaluation (M&E) Unit
w4s set up under the Additional Director of Agriculture (Planning), with
staff as proposed in the SAR (with the exception of a sociologist). Few
problems of note were encountered by the M&E unit, which began its functions
early in 1981, and produced reports of a good standard on all aspects of the
project. The Unit has published reports on 4 Monitoring surveys, 11
Monitoring-cum-Evaluation Surveys, and 9 Special Studies (see Attachment 1).
Project Costs
3.9      At  appraisal  the  project  was  estimated to cost Rs128.4 million
(USS15.3 million). Based on data available at OOA, actual project costs, as
shown in Table 1, are estimated at Rs284.5 million (USS25.1 million), or
221% (164% in USS terms) of the appraisal estimate. However, the two total
costs are not altogether comparable. This is on account of the fact that
while the SAR estimates include only the costs of incremental staff to 3e
hired under the proJect with related incremental operating costs, cost data
available at OOA include the costs of both incremental staff as well as
existing (i.e. pre-project) OOA staff deployed from other schemes to work
exclusively on the extension project (see para 4.11).
3.10      If the staff and operating costs are excluded, the actual costs f:r
the other components (civil works, equipment and vehicles, and training)
were 160% (111% in USS terms) of the appraisal estimate. The much lower cost
overrun in dollar terms reflects the relatively large depreciation of tne
Indian rupee since appraisal (1986 exchange rate of Rsl2.60 per USS, as
compared to SAR rate of Rs8.40 Pe USS). The highest cost overrun has beem
on civil works (199% of SAR estimate), where due to a significant delay r
component execution, combined with high inflation, there were much higher
unit construction costs to be  paid  as  compared  to  ohat  was  original',
estimated.
ProJect Financing and Credit Allocation
3.11     The   IDA   credit   of  USS10  million  was  expected  to  financt
approximately 65% of SAR estimated total project costs. While the total
credit &llocated for the project was disbursed, actual disbursements were
far behind the SAR schedule (see basic data sheet). Though partly on account
of the delayed start-up of the project (and that only 3 districts were
covered up to  the  b lirii - ^   I n        ^              -                     -A

the vehicle.



- 10 -
the credit through completing the civil works component, IDA kept open
disbursements informally for qualifying expenditures incurred up to the  end
of December 1986. Based on the revised estimate of total costs, as shown in
Table 2, the IDA credit financed around 40X of the total cost.
3.12     In terms of the allocation of credit proceeds proposed in the  OCA,
actual disbursements show that the categories for civil works and staff
salaries were overdisbursed, while the training, and vehicle and equipment
categories were not fully disbursed. No formal reallocation of credit
proceeds, between the different categories, was carried out.
Compliance with Covenants
3.13     In general, GOK complied with the major covenants included  in  the
Development Credit and Project Agreements, though in some instances there
were delays in meeting the target dates. Due to financial stringencies,
inadequate budgetary provisions were made, inhibiting project imp,ementation
as envisaged in the SAR, particularly in the earlier part of the project.
GOK's inability to recruit staff to fill all positions (particularly at AEO
level), meant that it was unable to comply with the covenant requiring tihat
officers   designated   for   extension  activities  would  not  have  other
responsibilities (such as managing the agricultural aevelopment units).
Oelays were also experienced in the submission of audit certificates
regarding project expenditures, though in this case too, the situation
improved significantly towards the end of the project.
IV. INSTITUTIONAL PERFORMANCE
Institutional Reorganization
4.1      The main thrust cf the project was institutional reorganisation ard
strengthening of DOA, in order to establish an effective extension serv4ce.
While significant delays were experienced in getting the project started :.
the project has succeeded in putting In place the basic extension struct4re
as envisaged at the time of appraisal (see para 2.7). The day-to-day
administrative   and   technical   management  of  the  project  became  the
responsibility of the AOA (Extension), under the Director. OOA. Active
collaboration with the research activities of the Kerala Agricultural
University was achieved under the project.  The  State  Tecnnical  Committee
(STC) set up under the project, was responsible for guiding technical
coordination  and  research  and  extension  linkages.  Oistrict   Techn':al
Committees  (DTCs)  and  the  Zonal  workshops  were  established  mainly to
strengthen  research/extension  linkages   and,   together   with   farmer's
representatives   (as   members   of  DTCs),  identify  research  needs  and
priorities.
4.2      Project Coordination. The Project Coordinating Committee, with  the
Director, DOA as member/secretary, met for the first time in January 1981 as
agreed to at Appraisal. Subsequently, the mpetings were generally irregular,
and over the rest of the implementation period it met a total of five times.
It proved unsuccessful in addressing some of the key problems faced by tre
project in meeting appraisal targets, principally on account of its limited
influence on government decisions regarding financial/budgetary support to



the project: As a result, a State Steering Comittee (SSC) was constituted
in November 1984 with the Chief Secretary (to the Government) as chairman
and the senior-most officials of the relevant Oepartments (Economic
Development, Finance, Agriculture, Planning and Public Works) as members.
After its first meeting in December 1984, the SSC met three times again in
1985 and once in 1986. It had a favourable impact on implementation in terms
of ensuring adequate allocation of funds to complete construction and for
the purchase of vehicles and equipment; it took an Important decision on
Increasing the limits for loans and travel allowances for DOA staff.
DeDartment of Agriculture
4.3      With  the  proposed  institutional reorganization under the project
and the introduction of the T&V system of extension, it was expected that
OOA would be better able to advise farmers on the most appropriate farming
practices.  In  assessing  OQAs  performance,  various  aspects   must   be
considered. In terms of staffing, there were delays during the early
implementation period in getting the full complement of staff appointed,
particularly   at   the   extension  circle  levels.  however,  despite  the
difficulties of staff recruitment. OOA was able to fill vacancies, even if
many of them were on a temporary basis. Although technical standards were
improved over time with the six months' pre-service training and continuous
fortnightly and in-service training programmes, high quality was difficult
to maintain because fresh recruits were needed to rep ace the temporary ones
after 6 months of continuous service.
4.4      World  Bank  missions  found  that  supervision  of field staff was
inadequate, particularly during the initial period. Headquarters supervisory
staff were reminded of the need for more field visits, while field
supervisory staff were made to realise the need for a more comprehensive
checking of the activities of VEWs and the need for accompanying them on
some field visists to guide them in their work. While these weaknesses may
be attributed to inexperience, they were further aggravated by the overall
shortages in agricultural graduates resulting in many AEOs being assigned
responsibilities for the Agricultural Development Units (the numbers of
which were increased from 125 to 378) in addition to their extension duties.
4.5      In assessing OOAs performance with farmers, account must  be  taken
of the prevailing socio-economic characteristics and complex farming systems
of Kerala. It is estimated that only about 30% of farmers in Kerala are
full-time farmers. Many CFs chosen were not full-time farmers and some had
only small garden lots. A special study report prepared by the M&E Unit in
1985, found in a sample survey of contact farmers that an estimated 37% of
CFs were not engaged in agriculture, only 43% of CFs discussed messages with
fellow farmers, and 45% did not understand the purpose for which they were
selected as CFs. In addition 16% of CFs were related to each other. rhougn
IOA supervisions called attention to the need for review of this situation,
it took OOA a long time to make changes. In addition, the concentration of
efforts on CFs resulted in few non-CFs being reached with technical
messages. IOA supervision missions advised that VEWs include non-CFs in
their fortnightly visits; OOA has now adopted a system of giving VEWs
targets for visits to non-CFs. This  increased  the  percentage  of  non-CFs
receiving messages and although visits to CFs decreased as a result, the
total number of farm families receiving messages increased. However, with
the scattered nature of farms with the resulting poor comunnication among
farmers, there is a need for constant review of the adoption rate among
farmers in a T&V system with the possibi.lity of periodic changes of CFs.
Also, it is generally agreed that staff can be reduced in areaS where there



are only tree crops (with farmers being visited fewer times) and redeployed
in areas where mixed cropping patterns prevail.
4.6      Scheduled visits (2 visits per fortnight) to CFs was  not  easy  to
achieve and showed a decline over the years while those to non-CFs
increased. The percentage of farmers receiving single visits per fortnight
was however generally high and progressively increased with time during
project implementation. Estimates of farmers reached by the project are
discussed further in Chapter V below.
4.7      OOA  field  staff  participated  fully in the various workshops and
training programmes with KAU, and DOA's farm  trials  programme  was  merged
with those of KAU in order to improve on their design and overall relevance
to prevailing farming conditions. The fortnightly training of VEWs was
Instituted early in the project and despite initial problers the programme
improved over time with advice from IDA supervision missions resulting in
increased confidence among VEWs. While tne messages cover most of the
aspects of crop production, they are largely developed on a crop basis; deal
more with aspects related to fertilizer applications; and at least in tr'e
earlier stages did not take  into  account  enough  the  prevailing  farming
practices (see Attachment 2).
4.8      Overall,  the  extension  service  (in  collaboration with research
staff of KAU) now routinely identifies production constraints which are
subsequently discussed at various workshops and training sessions. However,
there are certain drawbacks in the manner in which extension messages are
developed. These include, among others: limited effort towards placing in
terms of priority the various constraints and problems of farmers which are
identified; the dearth of information and limited emphasis on the financial
implications of extension recommendations5 and most crops being viewed as
single entities when recommendations are formulated, even though many are
usually grown as mixeV crops in Kerala. Given that land pressure is great in
Kerala, there is a need to adopt a "whole farm approach" while formulating
messages and developing production recommendations.  These  are  all  issues
which need to be addressed if the management and hence the effectiveness of
the extension service is to be improved.
Research/Extension Linkage
4.9      Project  design  ensured  active  dialogue  and  linkages   between
research and extension (KAU, central Government managed research stations
and OOA) at all levels through a system of technical committees and
workshops  (see para 4.1). 4eetings of the STC were irregular to begin wit:.
After the initial meeting as agreed during negotiations, it met once in
March 1981. The next meeting was not until February 1983. After that
meetings were held twice a year as planned. Meetings of the OTCs were
regular  from  the  onset  of  implementation  and  their  performances were
considered very satisfactory. However, with the initiation of the Zonal
Research Advisory Comimttee (ZRAC) in 1983 under the National Agricultural
Research Project (NARP), the need for OTCs became unnecessary as all SMSs
and other BOA staff were involved in the ZRAC. OTC meetings were stopped in
1984. wmile the technical committees were meant to assist in technical
decision making, the worksnops were to ensure a continuous dialogue between
research and extension activities and to develop a system by which field
problems could be properly linked to research endeavours. The bi-annual
Zonal workshops, as well as its off-shoot of monthly district workshops,
developed into extremely useful meetings where researchers faced extension
staff in often heated but friendly exchange of views. In addition to



- 13 -
reviewing   the   agricultural  situation  in  the  sub-divisions,  subjec:s
discussed at the workshops included farm trials, field problexs,  impact  of
the T&V system, and reports of the M&E Unit and Diagnostic Teams. There were
also presentation of special topics, skill demonstration on specific
practices and formulation of messages. In support of the overall training
programhe, KAU brings out a number of instructional materials, which have
proved extremely useful for strengthening extension efforts in the State
(see Attachment 3).
4.10     An important development  during  project  implementation  was  the
bringing together of extension and research workers in the conduct of field
trials (adaptive research). Up to the end of 1984 few farm trials were
conducted by ODOA; meanwhile, KAU was conducting its own multi-locational
trials for testing varieties on farmers fields. With the assistance of IDA,
KAU organized workshops on farm trials from August 1984. and Regional.
Research Centres became the focal points in developing programmes for farm
trials. Proposals emanate from extension and research staff ac Zonal
workshops, and are discussed at the ZRAC meetings and managed as a commcn
farm trials programme run jointly by KAU and OQA. Another development n
strengthening research extension linkage was the estab}ishment of field
Diagnostic teams made up of researchers from KAU and DOA staff. These teams
go into the field for cn-the-spot discussions with farmers to study thei-
field problems, and ascertain reasons for adoption or non-adoption of
recommended practices. The Diagnostic Team approach to research extension
linkage was developed under NARP, and its implementation in Kerala has
resulted in a better understanding of the complex farming system and i;i
incorporation of farmers' practices into the field trials programmes.
Accounts and Reporting
4.11     The Department of Agriculture maintained information (considared by
IDA to be adequate as a project account) on component-wise expenditures.
However, the classification provided for recording project incremen:al
expenditures included certain other expenditures also. Such inadequacies in
accounting information related mainly to expenditure on staff costs, which
included expenditure on existing extension staff (redeployed from other pre-
project schemes to work on extension under the project), in addition to
incremental extension and support staff employed under the project. While
the need to separate the costs of existing and incremental extension and
support staff was stressed by IDA (Financial Review mission, October 1984),
OOA were unable to introduce and implement a suitable accounting format.
This was largely on account of the dispersed locations all over the State
where   expenditures  were  being  incurred,  the  high  turnover  of  staff
(particularly temporary staff), and the difficulties faced by district and
lower level accounting staff in being able to recognize and correctly record
the different costs for existing and project related incremental staff.
4.12     Other than the delays experienced in submitting audit  certificates
related to project accounting, reporting on project progress was generally
satisfactory. Since 1982, six-monthly progress reports were submitted by
GOK; in addition, a series of monitoring and evaluation reports (and special
reports)  were  submitted  (see  Attachment  1),  once  the  M&E  unit   was
established in late 1981.

V. PROJECT IMPACT
General
5.1      At appraisal, it was estinated that the project would  be  able  to
generate a 50% economic rate of return if, by 1987, yields of foodgrains
increased by 12 kg/ha and the per hectare yields of coconut and tapioca
increased by 10%. As stated in the SAR, quantifying the precise level of
benefits generated from an institutional development project of this nature
is difficult, since it is not possible to determine what proportion of
benefits (arising out of, for example, increased yields) are due to
extension alone and what are due to additional purchased inputs or other
concurrently ongoing development efforts. Consequently, no attempt has been
made to estimate an economic rate of return for the project.
5.2      However,  data  from  the  M&E surveys provide an indication of the
numbers of farmers reached by the reorganized extension, and extent of
adoption by farmerl of messages conveyed by the extension staff. These are
discussed 1n the section below. Although it is still too early in the course
of project implementation to expect a measurable impact on crop yields, the
final section reviews briefly the levels of average crop yields both during
the pre-project period and thereafter.
Farmers Reached and their Adoption of Messages
5.3      In  reviewing  the  findings of the M&E surveys, it is necessary to
recognize that in -Kerala there is a predominance of homestead-based
agriculture; the rural population is more dispersed, and much less village-
based as compared to other States in India; and most farmers practise mixed
cropping of both annual and tree crops, though there is a large area of
mono-cropping in the coastal sandy strip of coconuts and in the eastern hill
areas of rubber and tea. In addition, the majority of farmers in the State
are part-time farmers. The combination of these factors makes effective
extension more difficult to carry out.
5.4      Data  from  the  M&E surveys show that 72% of contact farmers (CFs)
received the regular 2 visits a fortnight during 1981-82, but this declined
in subsequent years with the steepest decline experienced in 1983-84 (see
Table 6). This was the period when the project was extended to all the other
districts simultaneously. In 1986-87 only about 57% of CFs had two visits
per fortnight. Approximately 85% of CFs received at least one visit a
fortnight in 1981-82; this fell to around 77% in 1986-87. These declines in
the percentage of CFs visited were however, compensated by increases in the
percentage of non-CFs visited. While in the beginning there were virtually
no visits being made to non-CFs, by 1986-87 around 6% of non-CFs were
vis'ted twice and about 15% once in a fortnight. Assuming a ratio of one CF
to nine non-CFs, an estimated 21% of total farmers were being visited by
VEWs by 1986&87. Regularity of these visits is however poor. Survey data
also show that VEWs are now the principal source of advice (mainly on  paddy
production) for farmers; also there is a a reduction in the percentage of
farmers receiving no advice at all. However, the number of CFs who discuss
messages with non-CFs is estimated at being only around 50%.



- 15 -
5.5      The M&E surveys on adoption rates were naturally biased on adoption
of technology on paddy and coconuts, the two main crops in the State. Data
collected show that approximately 60% of the Cfs used tho recommended seed
varieties; however, it is not clear from the available data as to how many
of the Cfs changed the seed used to the recommended variety as a result of
the VEWs recomnendations. Although a large number of farmers had been using
fertilizers on paddy, types and rates of application needed to be changed.
The M£E reports show that:
a) there is an increase in number of CFs using the recammended rates
of fertilizer on HYV paddy (at least 50-75% of recommendations).
This led to an increase in the use of straight fertilizers at the
expense of compounds, with resultant de-4?ase in cost of fertilizer
application;
b) there is an increase in the use of mRineral fertilizers on coconuts
althoug' wore CFs use mireral fertilizers than do non-CFs;
c) there haS been a 44% increase in fertilizer  use,  rising  from  34
kg/ha  to  49  kg/ha between 1981-82 and 1985-86 (although this may
not be solely due to the project);
d) the adoption rate for recommended use of plant protection chemicals
is however not consistent (probably due to the annual changes in
pest incidence) although there is a discernable increase in
adoption.
Impact on Production
5.6      It  is  still  too  early  to  assess  the  project's   impact   on
productivity. However, yield data collected by the State's Directorate of
Economics & Statistics has been tabulated to compare yields during the
project years with pre-project yield levels. An examination of Table 7 on
yields shows that among the important crops, average yields (in the two
years 1984/85-85/86) have increased by more than 10% as compared to the pre-
project average (1976-81) in the case of paddy, cardamom and banana;
remained largely unchanged in the case of coconuts, tapioca and aracanuts;
and show a decline in the case of rubber, cashew, pepper and coffee. The
average yield of paddy of 1.73 t/ha (for 1984-86) represents a 12% yield
increase (or 180 kg/ha) over the five year pre-project average. The stagnant
overall yield per hectare of coconut is possibly on account of the increase
in area under the crop with a resultant increase in the number of non-
bearing trees not adequately accounted for in estimating average yields; the
small increase in the yield of tapioca is reportedly on account of poor
market prices prevailing, which act as a disincentive for farmers to take
measures aimed at increasing productivity.
Institutional Impact and Sustainabilitv
5.7      The  long-term  effect  of  the  project  from  strengthening   and
reorganizing OOA is expected to be positive and should lead to increasingly
higher rates of adoption of  new  technologies.  Although  the  build-up  of
operational capability was slower than planned, it has by and large been
achieved in the final stages of the project. The institutional framework of
i



- 16 -
the T&V system IS in place, the methodology of extension is accepted and now
practised routinely, training sessions are well prepared and a system of
extension-research linkages well established. The momentum and gain achieved
will, however, require a continued comuitment  to  the  programme  from  OOA
officials  at  t-e  higher  levels,  and  management  approaches  (including
incentives) need to be adopted which will ensure the motivation of staff
particularly at the field level. In particular, due consideration will need
to be given to how, for example, monthly workshops should evolve in the
future to avoid becoming repetitive and monotonous in nature; greater
imagination wi11 be required in developing messages to ensure that farmers
retain an interest in and respect for VEWs; and that there is adequate
coverage of non-CFs in DOA's extension activities.
VI.  IDA PERFORMANCE
Overall Peformance
6.1      In  initiating  and  financing  the  project, IDA made an important
contribution towards reorganizing the Department of Agriculture, and re-
structuring Kerala's agricultural extension activities towards a target
oriented approach (away from the diffused system of multipurpose workers and
numerous crop based schemes), emphasizing and increasing the awareness and
importance of extension, and in particular its linkages with agricultural
research at all staff levels. While due emphasis was given in project design
to staffing leveTs, staff training and developing mechanisms for effective
research/extension linkages, inadequate attention was devoted, either at
appraisal or during Implementation, to the socio-economic differences in
Kerala's agriculture sector as compared to the other States, while devising
the manner in which extension was to be carried out. Very early in the
discussions between IDA (NOO) and GOK, it was recognized by IOA that "there
may be some opportunities to modify the T&V system to fit better Kerala's
somewhat unique conditions" (see para 5.3). However, virtually no change was
made under the project to the traditional T&V system suggested for
implementation in Kerala. For example, the frequency of VEWs' visits
suggested for largely tree crop farmers has been the same as that for
farmers with mixed cropping systems. No attempt was made to promote informal
farmer groups to complement CFs as a means for disseminating extension
messages.
Supervision
6.2      A  total  of  11  Supervision  missions were fielded by IOA betwee"
January 1981 and June 1986. The composition of the missions was technically
satisfactory, ana there was good continuity of staff between missions. In
addition to the supervision mission, there were other technical back-
Stopping missions by NOO staff, which contributed significantly towards
project implementation and getting a better understanding among extension
officials of the extension methodology.

VII. CONCLUSIONS
7.1      The  project  has  been  generally  successful  in  establishing  a
framework for agricultural extension in the State of Kerala, which is now
well understood by most of the staff involved. Through an extensive training
progranme,  the  project  has  contributed  in  instilling  confidence   and
upgrading technical skills among extension personnel. Though there were
delays in the start-up of the project and in completing the civil works
component, the project has been implemented largely as envisaged at
appraisal. While the pre-seasonal, monthly and fortnightly workshops are
being conducted to varying degrees of effectiveness, they along with the
ongoing farm trials progranme  have ensured  effective  interaction  between
extension   staff   and  research  scientists  of  the  Kerala  Agricultural
University. It is recognized that this regular interaction has resulted in a
perceptible shift in research done in KAU more in line witr farmers'
problems, though this needs to be further reinforced, particularly in giving
it a farming systems focus.
7.2      Given  the  institution building nature of the-project, it is still
too early to enable a judgement on its impact on agricultural productivity.
However, data collected by the M&E unit of OOA, as well as discussions with
officials and farmers for the purposes of preparing this PCR, point towards
certain conclusions on how the extension system is operating. Broadly, these
show that:
i) contact farmers have not always proved to be efficient and
effective in disseminating information from VEWs; while this may
partly be on account of poor selection of CFs, it is also a
reflection of the nature of rural society and the agricultural
sector in Kerala;
ii) there  is  concern  that  the  extension  efforts,   as   well   as
complementary research activities (for example, on-farm trial
locations) are heavily biased towards contact farmers;
iii) the adoption of the T&V system, with little variation to account
for the special conditions of Kerala, has meant that VEWs are
visiting largely tree crop contact farmers on the same frequency as
the other farmers; however, there is little to convey to such
farmers on a fortnightly visit basis;
iv) there is concern that messages are getting repetitive, since the
ability of research stations to come up with new recommendations cn
a regular basis is obviously limited; this inevitably influences
the reception of VEWs from contact farmers, as well as the morale
and confidence of VEWs themselves;
v) research and extension messages are largely crop based, which ao
not take into account adequately enough the fairly complex cropping
patterns in Kerala; furthermore, not enough emphasis has been given
while developing extension messages to economic factors, i.e. the
direct financial impact on the farmer from adopting a particular
recommendation;
i

7.3      For a project of an institution building nature, it  is  inevitable
that performance depends largely on the individuals carrying out critical
tasks. While a major step has been taken to successfully establish an
extension framework, there are certain observations which can be made on the
basis of experience In Kerala so far. These include the following;
a) while the T&V system provides a framework for extension, due
consideration must be given to specific local conditions when it is
introduced in a new area, while designing the detailed manner in
which it will be implemented;
b) when the T&V system is newly introduced in a" area, it should be
recognized that without specifically designed interventions or
mechanisms, the implementing institution will not, at least ih the
initial stages, be able to maintain the necessary balance in Its
support of contact and non-contact farmers: consequently, there
will be an overemphasis on the contact farmers;
c) in connection with the above, the use of voluntary organizations at
the rural level (or informal farmer societies) should be considered
to complement the extension activities through contact farmers;
d) for the implementing agency, it  is  imperative  to  recognize  the
importance of effective field level monitoring and supervision by
middle and senior managers;

Important Production Recommendatlons Generated and Adopted by Large Section
of Farmers
Rice
1.       Use  of  fertilisers at recomnended quantities (incorporating 4, P.
and K at correct dose depending on the duration and variety of crop) and
application at appropriate time, giving emphasis to the following:
a) basal application of phosphatic fertilisers as a compulsory step
and split application of N & K for Basal and Top dressings;
b) second top dressing one week before planickle initiation;
c) discouraging the use of complex fertilisers and using straight
fertilisers for basal and top dressings.
2.       Ensuring optimum plant population by  planting  correct  number  of
seedlings per square metre, i.e., adjusting spacing according to the
duration of the variety.
3.       Application of chemical weedicide as a low cost technology.
4.       Need  based  application  of   pesticides   (thereby   discouraging
indiscriminate use of pesticides).
Coconut
5.       Application of balanced fertilisers at proper time.
6.       Applying the fertilisers at 1.2  metre  away  from  the  trunk  and
within the active root zone area.
7.       Irrigating  the  palm  during  summer months (farmers are convinced
that irrigation during summer will definitely increase yield).
8.       Mulching the tree basins during sumer to prevent the  ill  effects
of drought. Mulching with dry leaves or stubbles of paddy is accepted as a
low cost technology to protect the tree during summer.
9.       Applicatlon of organic matter (farm yard manure or green manure) to
the tree.

10.      Pest control measures and spraying for coconut leaf disease.
Pulses
11.      Application of fertilsers to pulse crops.
12.      Use of high yielding varieties for better yield. (Popularisation of
different varieties by the Department of Agriculture through Minikit
Programme,  etc.  have resulted in the regular cultivation of such varieties
in place of old, low yielding ones).
13.      Taking a pulse crop during the 3rd crop season in rice fallows.

PROJECT COMPLETION BEPORT
Evaluation Summary
Introduction
1.         The Maharashtra Agricultural Extension Project was
executed between 1981 and 1987. The project was intended to
finance the reorganization and strengthening of the Department of
Agriculture (DOA) extension service based on the T&V approach. The
Credit closed on time in June 1987. Total project cost, estimated
at appraisal at USS 38.2 M was supported by an IDA Credit of USS
23.0 M (SDR 18.9 M). The total credit amount has been disbursed.
Prolect Objecti2es and gationa1p
2.         The project intended to support the reorganization and
strengthening of the DOA extension service, aimed at establishing a
professional extension service answerable to the Zilla Parishad
(District Council) but that cannot be diverted for other purposes
with effective control from the Director of Agriculture to the
Village Extension Workers (VEW) through: consolidating staff from
special crop schemes into a unified extension service; hiring
additional staff; establishing the T&V methodology of extension;
supporting a variety of training programs; providing vehicles for
the different levels of staff; constructing staff housing; and
meeting other incremental costs of the DOA, including those for
setting up a monitoring and evaluation unit. Through improvements
in the extension service it was expected that agricultural
productivity and farm incomes would increase over time.
Project Implementation, Results and Sustainability
3.         The project has achieved its main objective of
establishing a framework for agricultural extension in the state
based on regular training and farm visits by staff working
exclusively on extension (earlier multipurpose workers and numerous
crop schemes). A strong link with research has also been
established which has led to farmers' problems being addressed in a
more systematic manner. The project was implemented largely as
envisaged at appraisal except that the phasing was compressed so
that the reformed extension system covered the entire state within
16 months instead of three years. The initial focus on filling
field positions was accompanied by a slow development in quality of
implementation. Difficulties encountered during implementation
include: staffing (scarcity of qualified staff, high turnover,
reserved quotas, ban on recruitment, etc), only 60 SMS teams to
cover 90 subdivisions, dual line of command (VEWs assigned non-



- 36 -
extension tasks), poor and biased selection of contact farmers,
initial shortage of transport, and slow progress on civil works.
4.         By the end of the project most staff had been appointed,
all the vehicles have been procured and 62% of the civil works
program had been completed.  Farmers are being better served now as
a result of the project. Data from M&E surveys show that the
practises recommended by the VEWs are increasingly being adopted
and this in turn has led to increased use of inputs and higher
yields. It is still too early to assess the project's overall
impact on productivity. rhe long term effect of the project is
expected to be positive and lead to increasingly higher rates of
adoption of new technologies. The momentum and gain achieved will,
however, require a continued committment to the program from higher
level officals of the state government and management improvement
to ensure the motivation of staff at the field level. Moreover,
the sustainability of the improved extension system would be
enhanced by the implementation of further institutional,
administrative, and policy reforms as outlined in paras 7-9 of the
PCR Overview.
Findings and Lessons
5.         While project design gave due attention to staffing of
extension, extension/research linkages and transport more attention
should have been given to: (a) qualification of VEWs which was not
specified - as a result the a substantial number of VEWs have
minimal education (less than 10th grade ) (b) having 60 teams for
90 subdivisions -albeit small- has proven difficult to manage; (c)
staff should not be assigned non-extension work, the extension set-
up used in Maharashtra where staff are answerable to the Zilla
Parishad can work smoothly if the CEO of the Zilla Parishad has a
strong interest in extension (d) provision of additional staff and
equipment for research support to extension at the district level;
(e) imaginative technical packages need to be developed with
messages that are within the technical and financial reach of the
farmers in order to maintain their interest in the extension
service, the need is especially strong for new tecnologies for
rainfed areas.

MAHARASTRA AGRICULTURAL EXTENSION PROJECT
(Credit 1135-IN)
PROJECT COMPLETION REPORT
I. INTRODUCTION
1.01     Soon after Independence. the Government of India (GOQ.. began
sponsoring a number of programmes designed to meet the need for more
effective, country-wide agricultural development. These included:
Community Development Prcgrammes in 1952, National Extension Service blocks
in 1953, Intensive Agricultural District Programmes in 1960. Intensive
Agricultural Area Programmes in 1963-64, Small & Marginal Farmers
Development Programme in 1969-70. Despite their proliferation, however,
these programmes covered a small proportion of the farmers. Recognizing
that a better approach would be required to service farmers better in
response to changing rural and administrative conditions, the GOI, with IDA
assistance introduced the training & visit (T&V) extension system. It was
introduced in India through pilot projects in the Rajasthan Canal Command
Area Development in 1974, and the Chambal Command Area Development Project,
in Madhya Pradesh in 1975. Following positive results of these experience,
many States have now adopted the system as an integral part of their
agricultural services.
1.02     The Maharashtra Agricultural Extension Project is the ninth in a
series of IDA - assisted projects, The Project was appraised in October
1980 and provided for the re-organisation of the existing extension system
into a service with a single line of command from extension headquarters to
a full time village level extension workers, capable of providing farmers
with up-to-date technical advice on a regular and systematic basis. It
also provided for an extension programme of regular training and improved
linkage between agricultural extension and research. The project was
officially declared effective in July 22, 1981. It was completed in June
1986 and the credit closed in June 1987. This project completion report
(PCR) summarized the project's performance during implementation and its
impact on the agriculture of the State. The report is the result of a
review of the Staff Appraisal Report, the Development Credit Agreement &
Project Agreement, World Bank Supervision Reports and Project files;
progress and other reports prepared by the Monitoring and Evaluation Unit:
and discussions with project staff and farmers.
II. PROJECT IMPLEMENTATION
Project Preparation
2.01     The project preparation exercise included a review of the existing
e'xtension system which is summarised below. Since 1962, when it instituted



- 38 -
the Panchayat Raj (Local Government) the Government of Maharashtra (GOM)
has regarded agricultural extension as a task of the local authorities.
Under this system, both the multi-purpose village level worker or Gram
Sevakl(VLWIGS): and the Agricultural Extension Officer (AEO) stationed at
the blocx level who provided technical guidance to the farmers were
employed by the District Council called the Zilla Parishad (ZP) and worked
under tht direct control if the Block Develcpment Officer (BDO), the BDO
being in charge of all development activities in the block and is
answerable to the Panchayat Sariti. The BDO is responsible to the Chief
Executive Officer (CEO) of the ZP at the district level. CEO heads a
number of departments at the district level and is in charge of all
development activities entrusted to the ZP and is also the district liaison
officer with the State Government. Agricultural activities at the district
level are managed by the Agricultural Development Officer (ADO) who mainly
dealt with various development schemes included input supply activities.
and, like other district depattment managers, operated through the BDOs.
2.02     Parallel with this local government organization, there were a
number of State sector schemes of the Department of Agriculture (DOA)
mainly concerning cash crops. These, at the district level were handled by
an Assistant Director of Agriculture (cash crops), Residuary Officer
(statistical tasks, orchards, etc.) or Hybrid Seed Production Officer. In
1978, these schemes were put under the Chief Executive Officer of the Zilla
Parishad but maintained their own village level field staff of Agricultural
Assistants (AAs) outside the purview of the BDO and the Panchayat Samiti.
2.03     There are seven divisions in Maharashtra.  At the divisional level
of administration. the activities of the Department of Agriculture were
headed by a Superintending Agricultural Officer (SAO). assisted by a number
of Deputy Directors of Agriculture (DDA) responsible for the technical
guidance of agricultural activities in their respective districts. DDAs
were not stationed or based in the district and did not come under the
jurisdiction of Zilla Parishad.
2.04     Over the years, dissatisfaction with the effectiveness of the
multi-purpose VLW in increasing agricultural production had led to the
development of a variety of crop programmes of special area. Staff
employed under the programmes were administratively controlled by Subject
Matter Sections of the Directorate of Agriculture. But such programmes
covered only a small portion of farmers and were also attended to dissipate
extension efforts in many directions. In addition, staffing Levels,
training and facilities for field extension staff were inadequate.
2.05     In order to resolve the above mentioned problems, ".OM decided to
reorganize its extension service along with the lines of tho training and
visit system. A project to this effect was therefore initiAted and
prepared by GOM with assistance frem the WE resident staff Irom New Delhi.
The preparation report. which cnncentrat-d mainly on the r-organization of
DOA. on the integratio., of the different extension activiti-s and optimum
staffing levels was completed in earlv 1980.



- 39 -
Appraisal
2.06     The project was appraised in October 1980 and aimed at obtaining
early and sustained increased in agricultural productlon ia Maharashtra
through the re-organization and strengthening of the extension services of
DOA. The project proposed to support this re-organization by:
(a) provision of incremental staff (2925 AAIAS, 410 AEO, 167 SMS, 27
SDAO & 1 ADA);
(b) provision of transr-'trtation (168 four-wheel drive vehicles, 747
motor-cycles and 3,000 bicycles), office equipment and Audio-
Visual aids;
(c) provision of incremental operating costs, travel allowances,
vehicle operating costs and extension materials;
(d) construction of housing for extension workers (1200 for AS/AS) and
(150 for their immediate supervisors (AEOs);
(e) improvement of the capacity of the universities to collaborate
with DOA by provision of staff (16 senior posts pius supporting
staff), vehicles (4) and operating costs; and
(f) creation of a monitcring and evaluation capacity through provision
of staff (23 senior officers at HQ with supporting staff and 90
field officers in the field) transportation (1 four-wheel vehicle,
15 motor cycles and 90 bicycles) and operating expenses.
2.07     Under the project, the extension service of DOA was to be
reorganized following the T&V system to provide farmers the aecessary
technical advice on a regular visit basis. The extension field staff were
also to receive systematic training and technical support from DOA and
research.
2.08     Each Village Extension Worker (VEW) was assigned to work with a
number of farm families depending on local conditions, population density,
cropping intensity and accessibility. Based on available statistics, one
VEW covered about 900-1000 farm families. This implied that on an average,
one VEW would cover 800-900 operating farm families with the actual number
varying from around 600 in sparsely populated areas to a:ound 1,000
operating farm families in densely settled areas. A VEW was to divide
operating families in his jurisdiction into groups of 80-120 each and to
visit each group regularly on a fixed day of the week in a two-week cycle.
During his visit, the VEW was to meet the contact farmers s.elected from
each group and to involve as many other farmers as possible in discussions
and demonstrations.
2.09     The VEW was to be helped. guided and supervised in nis work by an
Agricultural Extension Officer (AEO), normally a graduat- .n agriculture.
One AEO was to become responsible for about 8 VEWs and  e    a: 'east four
days a week of his time visiting them in the field.            everv two weeks,
VEW was to receive a full day of intensive trair; ^            ._n? :elevant

recommendations for that period in the coming fortnight.  The AEO was
expected to participate in this training session. Thus, every two weeks,
AEO spends eight days in visiting each of his eight VEWs groups one day in
training and other days in meeting all his VEW in the field or at his
headquarters.
2.10     To provide regular training, continuous technical guidance and
supervision of field work, three or four sub-divisions were proposed to be
established in each district (a total of 90 sub-divisions for the State)
and led by Sub-Divisional Agricultural Officers (SDAOs) who headed 8-10 AEO
each. Where there were more than 10 AEOs in a sub-division, the SDAO was
to be assisted by Assistant SDAO (ASDAO). As some sub-divisions were
small, the project proposed to provide 60 teams of three Subject Matter
Specialists (SMS). (one in Agronomy, one in Plant Protection and one in
Training/Communication). Where a team of SMS has to operate in more than
one sub-division, the team was to be under the administrative control of
the SDAO where the team would be based. The SDAO was to ensure that the
team divided its time equally between both sub-divisions. The SMSs under
the control of SDAO were expected to spend one-third of their time in field
visits, providing technical support and guidance to VEW and AEO, one-third
in building their own stock of knowledge through a regular dialogue with
research workers and carrying out farm trials, and one-third in
participation in district monthly training workshops and attending short
training courses.
2.11     At the district level, the Principal Agricultural Officer (PAO)
was made to work full time on extension and to be responsible for the
overall extension programme in the district. The PAO was to be assisted by
3 or more SMS (specializing in training, extension and other
specializations not provided at the sub-divisional level), and answerable
administratively to the CEO of the ZPs. and technically to the Divisional
Join Director of Agriculture (JDA). The JDA was responsible for all
agricultural activities at the Divisional/Regional level. He supervised
3-4 districts of his zone and was directly answerable to the headquarters
for both extension and non-extension activities of DOA.
2.12     At the headquarters of DOA, the responsibility for overall
agricultural development in the State was to continue to rest with the
Director of Agriculture. But an Additional Director of Agriculture (Extn)
was to be appointed to be responsible for the day-to-day operations and
management of the extension service both technically and administratively.
He was also to be responsible for training and management of extension
personnel. The ADA (Extn) was expected to avail of the technical support
from four SMS of the rank of JDA at headquarters (one each for plant
protection. horticulture, farm management and farm trials and training).
These SMS were to be responsible for improving the technicaL quality of the
extension service in their aroas of specialization. and to levelop and
interpret farm trials, promote linkages with research carri.d out by the
four universities in Maharashtra and elsewhere in the country, organize
training programmes and serve as a clearing house of technical information.
2.13     The project called also for a strong links between extension and
research. The key links between the universities and the DOA was expected
to take place at the monthly district workshops, whose main function was to



- 41 -
prepare detailed plans for the fortnightly training of the VEW, and to
provide the basis for discussion on feedback from field staff. The PAOs
and the university Extension Agronomists were assigned the task of
organising these sessions for DOA staff and SHSs of the district ani sub-
divisions. A zonal seasonal workshop was also to be established to cover
the areas of influence of each of the four universities as a forum for
review of agricultural practices recommended as a result of new research
experience, to plan multi-locational verification of new technology, to
assess research priorities for the zone and to review the plans and results
of farm trials. The Director of Research at each university was given the
responsibility to organize the workshops and participants were expected to
be Zonal JDAs. PAOs and District SMS as well as the Director of Extension.
some department heads, Crop Co-ordinators and Extension Agronomists from
the university.
2.14     Zonal recommendations were to be presented by the University
Directors of Research and ADA (Extn) to the State Extension and Research
Committee, which was to the State Extension and Research Committee, which
was to be headed by the Secretary of Agriculture. Other participants were
to be the DA and other State level experts, the Vice Chancellor of the
universities, the Directors of Extension & Research Committee would review
zonal recommendations and assess progress of projects, particularly with
respect to research support. The committee was to meet at least twice
every year.
2.15     The project, to be implemented over a five year period, was
estimated to cost Rs. 306.0 million (US$38.2 million) and provided for an
IDA credit of US$23.0 million.
III. PROJECT IMPLEMENTATION
Project Start-Up
3.01     The project started on time with the initial impetus on filling
field positions as a priority in order to concentrate later on the actual
field implementation. This enabled GOM to provide induction training for
most of the field staff in the early stages of the project and to deploy
them in the field rapidiy. During that time, several of the VEW had more
than 1.500 farm families in their jurisdiction. In spite of this, each VEW
had selected only eight contact farmers in each group though some of the
groups had over 150 families in each group. This large farmer - VEW ratio
was later corrected to the pre-determined ratio. In these early stages,
the project was slow in appointing the JDAs and it took a few months before
GOM could give power to PAO to disburse and make provisions for office
accommodation for support staff. During this period all vehicles required
for the first eight districts were ordered and selection of sites for staff
housing soon started by the local panchavats. By middle of the first year,
the new extension system was introduced in all the eight di'tricts and
within 16 months, it was made operative thr.ughout the State.



_ 42 -
Revisions to the Project
3.02     No revisions of substance were made to the project and was
essentially implemented as foreseen at appraisal. Some minor revisions -
recorded were:
(a) increase of supervisory staff, vehicles and equipment as a result
of an increase in the number of districts by four to 29 after
appraisal; and
(b) increase in the number of staff of the monitoring and evaluation
unit at the field and headquarters.
Reorganization of the Extension Service
3.03     The compression of the phasing of the project into 16 months
instead of three years was accompanied by a slow development in quality of
implementation resulting from problems of staffing, training and research
extension linkage some of which persisted at the end of project
implementation.
3.04     The development of a high quality extension service was an uphill
task, particularly during the first three years of implementation and it
required a great deal of guidance from Bank supervision missions to DOA in
taking correct actions. Among the problems encountered during these years
were:
(a) the novelty of most of the staff to their role and inadequacy of
their re-orientation in the principles of the T & V system;
(b) the quick turnover of staff, particularly SMS, because of
promotions to fill the numerous supervisory posts created by the
project. SMS were therefore unable to effectively serve their
areas of specialisation because of lack of enough field
experience;
(c) minimal support to VEWs from AEOs because of lack of experience;
(d) initial shortage of transport;
(e) poor and biased selection of contact farmers which required
continual reviews;
(f)  poor supervision at all levels:
(g) over-burdening of staff with other than extension activities and
unnecessary reports:
(h) slow farmer awarenpqs of the role of extension staff with farmers
still associating extension staff with mini-kits and subsidy
programmes;



- 43 -
(i) slcw development of appropriate messages for extendinglpassing to
farmers even where some useful messages existed from past resezrch
findings. this applied particularly to rainfed crop production:
(j)  slow modification of general recommendations to suit specific
locations;
(k) non-utilisation of M & E findings as feedback for management of
training programmes and for improvement of the T & V system; and
(1) non-development of diagnostic teams, except in one agricultural
university, that is, in Konkan agricultural university.
3.05     By mid-1984, however, observable changes for the better had become
evident. Increased orientation courses had yielded results such as
improvement in monthly workshop seeping down to very much improved
fortnightly training programmes. AEO & VEW visit schedules had been
clearly drawn. Improvement in selection of contact farmers had began. VEWs
were making contact with non-contact farmers, the burdening of VEWs with
non-extension activities had been curtailed and gaps between available
technology and farmers' adoption considerably reduced.
3.06     Nevertheless by the end of project implementation there still
existed room for improvement in areas such as supervision and guidance of
VEWs by AEOs, regularity of visits by SMS, SDAOs and ADAOs, limited
coverage of farmers by VEWs because of the still higher than anticipated
farmer - VEW ratio, inadequate number of special courses for SMS and AEOs
and over emphasis on varietal trials.
Staffing
3.07     At appraisal it was assumed that the optimum VEW to farmer ratio
would be 1:800, that AOIAEO to VEW ratio would on average be 1:8.
Supervising management staff for the sub-divisional, district, regionai and
headquarters levels were also provided to allow for a straight line of
command necessary for the establishment of an effective professional
extension service. Staff for the service was obtained from:
(a) existing extension staff;
(b) re-deployment of staff from other schemes under DOA;
(c) transfer of multi-disciplinary village level extension workers
(VLW) or integrated gramseyaks (GS) from Zilla Parishads (ZPs) to
DOA; and
(d) by direct recruitment.
3.08     Table 5 shows the performance in filling in of incremental staff
positions as compared with appraisal. It demonstrated clearly that bv the
3rd year of implementation most incremental staff had been appointed except
in case of VEWs and sub-divisional SMS. VEW vacancies continued throughout
the project period because of insufficient inflow of candidates from



-44-
agricultural schools, promotion from this grade into higher grades as
vacancies occurred, non-availability of candidates, inadequate members from
the 'reversed quota," administrative problems in filling the posts by de-
reservation and a ban on further recruitment by the State.
3.09     Similarly the position of AEOs and Sub-divisional SMSs could not
be maintained at the appraisal level because of promotions on transfers to
filling in higher vacant position, the need to pass through the State
Public Service commissions recruitment procedures for these higher grade
officers and the reserved quota system.
3.10     Twenty-five posts of SDAO which were to have been deployed from
the ZPs were later found to be detrimental to input monitoring systems at
the ZPs and were therefore not re-deployed with the approval of IDA, DOA
filled the posts with incremental staff.
3.11     Although Table 5 shows 1002 achievement in the number positions,
in actual facts vacancies developed in several staff category as a result
of promotions of number of existing more senior staff to vacancies created
by the project. At project completion, technical posts still remaining
vacant were 386 VEWs. 60 AEOs. 36 SMSs, 7 SDAOs and 1 PAO. Sanctions for
recruitment for filling these vacancies have yet to be given by GOM.
Training
3.12     As responsibility for most staff training activities was given to
the universities, agreement was reached between GOM and IDA at negotiations
on staffing arrangements for VEW training institutions, the proposed
training curriculum and the schedule of training. The universities were to
be solely responsible for induction training of VEWs (1 month) for
providing short courses for SMS and Senior DOA staff (2-24 wks) and,
together with other universities in India, for or abroad, for promotional
courses (4 year B.Sc. courses for VEWs and 2 year M.Sc. courses for
AEO/SMS). They were also to join hands with DOA staff in pre-season
training for VEWs, AEOs and SMS (3 days), in providing short courses VEWs
and AEOs once in a year (7 days) and to participate in district monthly
workshops and in zonal workshops (twice a year). DOA senior staff were
however solely responsible for pre-season - training of VEWs twice a year
(3 days) and orientation training of their staff as and when needed.
3.13     Table 4 gives performance details under the various types of
training programmes. It shows that while DOA fell short. in its orientation
programme, its performance in pre-season training exceeded appraisal
targets. The universities also managed to achieve a high performance in
the areas of induction courses and in participation in monthly district
workshops. They, however. did not fare too well in their 'p-cial training
programmes.  This is claimed te be attributable to inadequato tunding for
staff and facilities.
3.14     Refresher courses under the DOA were not considered at appraisal.
They were found necessary and introduced in 1984-85. However, the targets
set were found difficult to achieve.



- 45 -
3.15     The failure during implementation, to depute VEWs for B.Sc. (Agri)
course was due to difficulties of the agricultural universities in
admitting the VEWs who had less than the requisite educationa'l
qualification. The State Government has therefore, set up a university
college at Latur under MAU, Parbhani for condense degree course in
agriculture during 1987-88. It is proposed to depute 35 VEWs for B.Sc.
(Agri) condensed degree course during the year 1987-88 alone.
3.16     The-most important training activity in extension, however, is the
fortnightly training of VEWs. Training was generally held at agricultural
schools and aimed at imparting to VEWs the stress points required for the
following fortnight. Training was the responsibility of the sub-divisional
SMS and AEOs were expected to participate in them as well.  The SDAOs
presided over the training session. Guest lecturers were invited for
specific subjects on which they were experts.
3.17     The day's programme normally started with general discussions on
the problems encountered during the previous fortnight and a review of
field conditions between trainers and trainees. this was followed by
lectures. discussions on general farming, input and other situation.
practical work on specific subjects and a rehearsal of messages by the
VEWs.
3.18     The training programme is now supported by audio-visual aids which
has greatly improved the quality of training. However, classes in some
circles are still larger than optimum for effective interaction between                     &
trainers and trainees because of shortage of sub-divisional SMS resulting
in this to pull together VEWs and AOs from more than one sub-division. An
added disadvantage of pooling two sub-divisions together is the distance
that VEWs have to travel to reach the training points.
Research
3.19     Research. the sole responsibility of the universities was slow to
react to the challenge to come out with appropriate messages for
transmission to farmers. There was an over emphasis on varietal trials and
demonstrations for the assumed reason that management trials and
demonstrations (on farmers' farms) which, coinciding as they were with
similar trials on research stations, required more supervision from and
transport facilities for research staff than were available. Thus a
substantial amount of management practices already available from past
research did not begin to reach farmers until half way during
implementation and the only as a result of prodding from Bank missions.
3.20     Rainfed farming which accounted for about 88% of  -Lrivable arpa
suffered more because technology for drought conditions hav- still to be
defined adequately to suit different ecological conditions. Needless to
say some messages have started to be brought out which have had a moral
raising effect on extension staff as farmers found them helpful. This
includes a lower population density for sorghum resulting in higher
yieldings of grain without adverse effect in straw.



- 46 -
3.21     Research staff, however, provided solutions to some of specific
problems brought to them by extension staff in areas of crop soil related
problems and pest control. where solutions were not available some
research work began on them.
3.22     At appraisal the staff resources of the universities were assumed
to be adequate and only eight Extensicr. Agronomists were provided for
training and research extension linkages. Th.e strain due to the load of
work on these is beginning to be fe:t as the extension philosophy becomes
more and more accepted. oarticularlv in terms of feedback and the need for
generating recommendations to specific environments increases and come into
conflict with a researcher's search for distinction in the areas of the
unknown.  At appraisal it was anticipated that the 4th National
Agricultural Research Pro,ect. ther. on stream, would provide the necessary
staff support and faci:ities to augment the provisions of this project.
Unfortunately this did not happer. as NARP II's support for research stopped
at the zonal level having district level activities with inadequate staff
and equipment for the work needed.
Civil Works
3.23     At appraisal ': w^s assutmed that staff houses would be constructed
through the Public Works De-partient's (PWD) wing of the Zila Parishad (ZP)
using the standard des'`n a?proved for various categories of staff.  Since
ZPs came under the adminis:rat.on cf district CEO, GOM ordered that
construct of the staff houses should be the responsibility of the Executive
Engineer (EE) of the ZPs who was also responsible for various construction
works within the distr-c:. DOI. had therefore, no direct control on the
implementation ard perfoniance of the civil works component.
3.24     Compared with other construction activities in the district, DOA's
requirements for stazf ho_;ing were of very low priority for the ZPs and
therefore received inadeoqa:e attention from the EES such as cement and
transport facilities. This has slowed implementation (Table 6). DOA could
also not properly mor-tor The utilisation of funds given to the ZPs and
costs rose to almost dcuble appraisal estimates. Few problems were
encounitered in the se:ec:ion of sites, which were mainly government-owned
lands or lands giver free by the ZPs for handing over to EEs for
construction, but sirce DOA was compelled to abide by the development needs
of the ZPs. it M'ad -c powers of influence on start up. However, once
construction startet, houses were generally completed within a few months.
3.25     At conrplet_cn of tas project 91 AOs' quarters and 748 VEWs'
quarters had beer ccrstructea as compared with appraisal estimates 150 and
1200 AOs and VEWs hcuses resp.ctivelv or a performance rating of 62x.

generally satisfac-crr  and provided with th'- necessary fitting for

Monitoring & Evaluation
3.26     The M & E Unit was establishe;d soon after the start-up of the
project in 1981-82. It was to be responsible for monitoring project
performance and to issue reports which would be used by management to
assess the effectiveness of the extension system and to make improvements
where necessary. These reports were to be based on continuous survey by
specially appointed sub-divisional level statistical assistants (27) under
the supervision of 15 districts level Senior Statistical Assistants. At
headquarters survey data would be computed by computers (4) and key-punch
operators (2) and analysed by 2 Senior Statistical Assistants. The unit
was to be headed by a JDA assisted by two DD (Economics & Statistics).
3.27     Three main types of reports were to be produced by the unit and
were to be based on three main types of surveys as follows:
(a) Monitoring Surveys (twice a year for each season);
(b) Monitoring-cum-Evaluation Surveys (twice a year during each
season); and
(c) Special studies (on various aspects of the T & V System as and
when needed.
3.28     Due to inadequate staff at headquarters. the computation and
analysis of the initial survey data was unduly delayed. When no reports
had been produced after a whole year the IDA supervision mission of October
1982 recommended the discontinuation of the processing of the baselines
studies and to use the results of the 1982-83 surveys as baseline for
future evaluation. The mission also recommended that headquarters staff be
strengthened to cope with the increasing backlog of survey data.  In May
1983. 14 additional posts of Senior Statistical Assistants were sanctioned.
3.29     At the field level the recruitment of staff did not increase at
the same rate as the number of districts covered by the project. This,
together with constraints in mobility was found to be adversely affecting
field performance and since the full staff requirement of 90 Statistical
Assistants proved difficult to achieve as rapidly as required, GOM
sanctioned the acquisition of motor cycles for the field staff to enable
them to cover larger areas. See Table 5 (page 2) for staffing performance
of the M & E Unit.
3.30     The first reports of the unit (that of the kharif season of
(1982-83) was published only in August 1983. The unit has so far been able
to publish 16 monitoring surveys of most seasons during the implementation
period: 5 monitoring-cum-evaluation studies and 6 special suirveys.
However, there is still a ba.klog of qurveys still to be puNlished.  Table
10 shows the list of reports published and those yet to be published. Out
of 27 reports published during the project period, it is observed that most
of them have been published late due to which the results of the reports
could not be used to achieve the objective of M & E as contemplated in the
Operational Notes on T & V System of agricultural extension by the World
Bank.



- 48 _
3.31     The Bank supervision mission also advised that a micro-computer be
purchased to speed up analysis and publication of reports. However, this
was delayed until April 1987. This should help in speeding up processing
and publication of the backlog of unpublx shed and future survey reports.
Vehicles & Equipment
3.32     There were no problems encountered in the purchasing of vehicles.
By the end of the third year, almost all vehicles required had been
purchased. Similarly most of the staff who were eligible to loans for
purchase of motor cycles and bicycles took advantage of the loan facilities
for purchase of their vehicles by the third year (Table 7).
3.33     At the inception of the project during the period prior to the
delivery of project vehicles, 38 four-wheel drive vehicles were pooled from
departmental service for the extension service.  When these became
unserviceable during implementation, DOA, with the agreement of IDA,
replaced these vehicles with new purchases of 5 wagonets and 33 jeeps on 30
June 1987. Total number of vehicles purchased were therefore, in excess of
appraisal estimates (Table 7).
3.34     Similarly, equipment consisting mainly of audio-visual aids for
training purposes were purchased on time whenever needed. However. during
implementation, the need for more audio-visual aids was found to be
necessary for improvement of training of field staff and with approvement
from IDA these were purchased (Table 8).
Procurement
3.35     The main item of procurement were houses for VEWs and AEOs,
vehicles (departmentally owned 4 wheeled and staff owned two wheeled
vehicles) and office and training equipment. As agreed at appraisal
contracts were awarded on the basis of competitive bidding following local
advertisement. For vehicles, since they would be purchased in small
quantities over three years and would be widely dispersed in rural areas
availability of spare parts was considered of paramount importance and as
such locally made vehicles of the type already used by government
departments were procured. Motorcycles and bicycles were purchased by
individual staff from loan funds provided by the State Government.
3.36     During implementation of the project, civil works construction
contracts were handed over to the ZPs on GOM's orders and were carried out
according to normal government bidding procedures which were satisfactory
to IDA. Departmental vehicles were procured from the approved GOM's firm
at government contract rates which was also satisfactory to IDA. Small
items of office and training equipment were purchased through prudent
shopping by the District PAO .r CEO.  However. other equipmonts that could
be bulked and needed some te'hnical specifications were procured through
the Departmental Purchase Committee. In no case did contracts exceed
USSlOOo000 which would have required IDA's approval both before bidding and
award of contract. Since the project staff were operating under familiar
procedures, no problems were encountered in procurement.



_ 49 -
Proiect Costs
3.37     The total project costs have been estimated at Project completion
at Rs. 463.5 million (US$40.8 million) against appraisal estimates of Rs.
306.1 million (US$38.2 million). These are about 1512 (107Z in US$ terms)
of the appraisal estimates. The cost overruns are mainly due to the staff
costs, whose phasing has been faster than anticipated at appraisal, and to
escalated costs of civil works as the result of the slow implementation of
this component. The comparatively lower costs increases in US$ terms are
due to continuous appreciation of the USS during the project implementation
period. Present exchange is Rs. 12.90 per US$1 against that at appraisal
of Rs. 8.0 per US$1. Table 1 & 2 provide details on annual projects costs
as well as comparison between appraisal estimates and actual expenditures.
Disbursement
3.38     Because of the faster coverage of T & V in the State than
anticipated at appraisal, disbursement was about double of the appraisal
estimates in the first year (Table 3). However, the rate of disbursement
in the later years was reduced to percentages ranging from 71% to 84%. The
main reason for this was the delay in the completion of civil works and the
continuous appreciation of USS against the Rupee (Paragraph 3.34).
3.39     During the initial year the project staff were not very conversant
with the preparation of withdrawal applications dic. had included some items
not eligible for reimbursement viz. claims for e.panditure on support
staff, for contingencies on costs, and for operating expenses on vehicles
which were not eligible. On the contrary, the project staff was not making
claims on expenditures on salaries of all eligible extension staff, but
limited its claims only on incremental staff. These points were explained
to the project staff by an IDA mission, a specialist on expenditure
accounts and disbursement procedures, in July 1982. Nevertheless the
project continued not to claim reimbursement on all eligible staff until
year 4 of the project. Disbursement was suspended on 1st October. 1986
because of GOM's inadequate financial reporting (Paragraph 4), but was
resumed on 19th March, 1987 after GOM fulfilled the reporting requirements.
IV. INSTITUTIONAL PERFORMANCE AND DEVELOPMENT
Initial Reorganization
4.01     The project's main theme was the re-organisation and strengthening
of the extension service of the DOA in order to improve its effectiveness,
DOA which was expected to introduce the T&V system, phased o.ver a three
year period, succeeded in covering the whole state within lFi months from
start-up. This was achieved because of stt(ng efforts by G'(M in
requisitioning staff from other departments and recruitment new staff. The
initial level of staffing was later disrupted as a result .f promotions to
the vacant posts by seniority and c-onsequent transfers of staff. The
staffing issue remained critical throughout the project implementation
particularly with regard to VEWs. AEOs and sub-divisional SMS (Table 5).



- 50 -
E          4.02      Nevertheless, the project succeeded in putting in place the basic
institutional structure for carrying out extension along the lines of the
T&V system as contemplated at appraisal. The ADA (Extension) has taken
charge of the day-to-day management of the project and linkages between
extension and research established. The State Extension and Research
Committee was maintained and met 10 times (Table 10) to assess progress of
the projects especially of research support and to solve any constraints
resulting from deficient coordination.
4.03     The project's organizational set up is different frem other
similar projects in the country, because it has not the single line of
command which characterizes the IDA assisted extension projects in India.
At appraisal. it was explained that the aim at the district level was to
build a professional extension service answerable to the Zilla Parishad,
but which cannot be diverted for other purposes except in rare emergency
situations. Therefore. although the PAO is assigned full-time on extension
works. he discharges his responsibility under a double line of command, the
CEO for administrative matters and the Divisional J.D.A. for technical
matters. Although confined within DOA there is also a double line of
command as far as the Divisional JDA is concerned. The Divisional JDA is
responsible for all agricultural activities in his Division. He is
therefore responsible to the ADA (Extension) as far as extension works is
concerned, but to the DOA for the other non-extension activities.
4.04     The Divisional JDA's double line of command within DOA is
mentioned here as a difficulty only to illustrate the heavy work load and
the double accountability of the Divisional JDA. The double line of
command at the district level, involving the ZP is, however, an anomaly
which in some cases has discouraged extension staff at the district and
field level because of bifurcated loyalty to the DOA and CEO. Although the
extent i: not known, there are reports that CEO's have instructed PAO and
their staff to undertake non-extension works. Examples of non-extension
works undertaken by extension staff includes campaign on small savings,
family planning, bio-gas development and non-agricultural extension works
in tribal areas. The DOA has protested on a few occasions and invited the
CEO's concerned not to assign extension staff to non-extension. In his
letter of 21 May 1984, copied to all CEO's, the Additional Chief Secretary
of GOM warned against such misuses and instructed as follows: "You are
therefore requested not to requisition the services of the extension staff
for organizing campaigns. Only in case of grave emergencies such as floods
and where it is absolutely essential the services should be requisitioned.'
In spite of these instructions from the Government, not only the FAOs and
his extension staff from the district but within DOA also. the Divisional
JDAs (Extn.). State level JDAs (Extn.) and ADA (Extn.) have been assigned
with many non-extension works.
4.05     The main issue remains whether the CEO's will refrain from using
extension staff for other w'rks. From CEO's point of view. the extension
staff are within the jurisdirtion of the ZP of which he is the
administrative head like the staff of other departments.  Since most of the
activities within the village are for the benefit of people who are
predominantly farmers is tempted to use the most available staff, whether
extension or not, in works considered by him and the ZP as priority works.



- 51 -
On the other hand, the PAC, being administratively under the CEO. cannot
refuse to undertake non-extension works. It should be remembered that it
is the CEO who annually evaluates the PAO's performance, which is later
used for promotion and career development. Smooth operation of the
e..tension service at the district and field level under the present set-up
can be achieved if the CEO places high priority on extension works.
However, being administratively answerable to the Rural Development
Department, the CEO has other development priorities and targets to achieve
every year.
Extension and Research Linkages
4.06     Extension research linkages were established at the State, zonal
and district levels. At the State level the linkage was in the form of the
State Extension and Research Committee, under the chairmanship of the
Secretary of Agriculture, whose membership included the Vice Chancellors of
the universities, the Director of Agriculture, whose membership included
the Vice Chancellors of the universities, the Director of Agriculture and
other State level expertise. the Director of Education, Crop Coordinators
and selected heads of other university departments. This committee which
met twice a year reviewed recommendations from Zonal committees and
prioritised them according to practices and research needs. It also
assessed the progress of research support for the project and any
constraints resulting from deficient coordination.
4.07     During period of implementation the Committee met on 10 occasions
including its first meeting on 30th September, 1981 as agreed with the
Bank, Meetings were conducted at an interval of 1 month to 16 months (Table
11). Thus its role in providing coordination for research and extension on
the seasonal basis is subject to doubt.
At the Zonal level, the Zonal workshops, held at each of the 4
universities were organised by the directors of Research at each university
in collaboration with the ADA Extension and attended by the Zonal JDAs,
PAOs. district SMS, selected university Department heads, crop coordinators
and Extension Agronomists from the University. The workshops were
responsible for reviewing agricultural practices recommended as a result of
new research and experience, planning multi-locational verification trials
of new technology, assessing research priorities for the zone in addition
to reviewing plans and results of farm trials conducted at the district
level. Zonal workshops were organised twice a year before each planting
season successfully.
4.08     The most important link between research and extension was the
monthly district workshops organised jointly by the FAO and the university
Extension agronomist appointed exclusively for this purpose. Participants
included all district and sub-division SMS and SDAO. univer:ity crop
agronomists. crop protection staff varving according to the erops and
problems relevant to each season.
The two day workshops, held generally at research stations was
responsible for preparing farm trial plans, their progress and analysis,
outlined plans for training of VEWs during the following two fortnights and



- 52 -
framing the messages for the next month address feedback on farmer
reactions by either making/modifying recommendations or referring problems
for further research.
4.09     Monthly workshops were held regularly at each district.  Initially
they responded very little to adjustments needed in recommendations that
take account of farmers resources and to location specific problems. Joint
field visits by participants were rarely undertaken to generate feedback
and diagnostic teams were late in being set up. Over time the workshop
have improved and this has seeped down into the monthly training
programmes. It is however felt that further improvements could be achieved
by such things as improved transportation for increased joint farm visits
and increased participation of research, the research staff in on-farm
trials.
Accounts and Reporting
4.10     An IDA mission which visited the project in July 1981 reported
that the DOA had an adequate system for recording project expenditure.
However, it suggested to prepare the expenditure in an identifiable project
account and provided a format to this effect. The mission also explained
the need to furnish IDA with certified statement of expenditure (SOE)
audit. No difficulties have been encountered with regard to keeping proper
and identifiable accounts for the project. However, the project faced
difficulties with regard to accounting and financial reporting. With the
exception of the first year, GOM was not submitting the certified SOE's
within the prescribed 9 months after the closure of each fiscal year. In
addition, due to misunderstanding, GOM was submitting only the audit
certification for each year but not the full audit report and the SOEs.
IDA, after reminding GOM of the need for satisfactory SOE audit, suspended
disbursement against SOE's until GOM complied by submitting audit
certificates of the SOE's for the overdue period 1981-82 to 1985-86 on 19th
March 1987. From this date, disbursement against SOE's was resumed.
4.11     Apart from the financial reporting requirements mentioned above,
the project was expected to prepare two periodical reports namelyt the 6
monthly progress report and monitoring and evaluation summary. The
preparation and submission to IDA of these reports were generally
satisfactory although some minor delay in transmitting to IDA were
recorded. Because of scarcity of staff no annual monitoring survey was
produced before August 1983 (Table 10). In general the reports were useful
in providing information about the project's progress and performance.
Compliance with Covenants
4.12     GOM has complied with all major covenants although in the case of
the covenant which required the furnishing to IDA with audited project
accounts it was done with excessive delav (paragraph 4.10). The only
major covenant which has been only partiallv complied with is the need to
review adequacy of ratio of VEW's and make adjustments, if necessary. The
review was carried out by the project and the need for additional 709 VEW's
and 87 AEOs has been identified. So far, however, GOM has not made the
necessary adjustments by sanctioning these posts.

V. PROJECT IMPA=I
General
5.01     The project's main thrust has been the re-organization of the
extension service of the DOA and its institutional impact has been
described in Chapters III and IV. Unlike in the case of the institutional
impact, it is difficult to assess the project's agricultural impact for two
reasons. First, the project being of institutional building nature, its
full impact in agriculture will be felt much longer after the
implementation period, when the Irocess of institutional strengthening is
advanced. Second. there are many other factors and agricultural inputs
which together with extension are responsible for increase in agricultural
productivity. Therefore separating benefits due to only extension becomes
difficult.
5.02     One of the striking feature of the project is its relatively low
cost. Hence even a very small and slow production increases can generate
high economic returns. The total projects cost, on current price basis, is
about Rs. 681 farm family or Rs. 26/ha. (assuming as total farm family
population of 6.86 million and cultivated area of 18.2 million ha.). The
recurrent annual cost would be only about Rs. 18/- farm family or about Rs.
8/-ha. based on the budget estimates for 1987-88. Due to continuous
drought in the last few years, it is difficult to appreciate even
indirectly from the State's agricultural statistics the project impact on
yields and production. However, based on sample survey carried out by the
M&E Unit it appears that farmers are increasingly adopting the messages
provided by VEWs and this betiefitting from the project as indicated below.
Adoption Rate
5.03     Monitoring and evaluation surveys carried out between 1983-84 and
1986-87 show the following:
(a) the number of farmers who know their VEW and reported being
visited by VEW's increased. Increases were higher among non-
contact farmers (NCF) than among contact farmers (CF) (Table 12).
Since there was an average of one contact farmer per group of 10
farmers this shows that despite the increase in farm family - VEW
ratio, the VEW did manage to increase their visits to farmers very
significantly;
(b) the percentage of farmers being visited regularly also increased
and so did that of farmers who reported that visits were useful.
Again the percentage increase was higher among NCF than CF:
(c) the use of improved varieties bv farmers increased in most crops
except irrigated bjajra where there was a slight derrease in ase
and in unirrigated wheat where there was little change in patterns
among farmers (Table 13);



_ 54 -
(d) the overall use of fertilizer increased every year (except in
1982-83 and 1986-87 when there were small declines in use) this
increase was evident in all three basic nutrients (Table 14).
Total consumption of NPK fertilizers increased by 652 in the pre-
project years but only by about 252 during project years;
(e) for most crops, the percentage of farmers using fertilizers as
well as those using them at near recommended ratio increased
during the project (Table 16);
(f)  except for a drastic decredse in 1986-87, the use of pesticides
rose during the period of implementation (Table 15);
(g) the use of pesticides for most crops decreased among CP during the
period of implementation while they varied with the type of crop
as regards M NCF - (Table 17);
(h) for the major crops, the yields of farmers visited by VEW were
higher than for those not visited except in the case of NCF
producing paddy under irrigation (Table 20);
(i) new sorghum, millet and groundnut varieties introduced during the
implementation period became widely accepted because of their
productivity;
(j) about two-thirds of the area under paddy has been brought under
intensive cultivation during project implementation and area under
HYV paddy increased by nearly 1 million hectares between 1982-83
and 1984-85; and
(k)  sunflower production spread from 63,000 ha. to 322,000 ha. in
1985-86.
VI. IDA PERFORMANCE
General
6.01      IDA's support in re-organizing the extension service has made an
important contribution to the effectiveness of DOA in advising farmers
better and thus to the agricultural development of the State. The project
design which called for the establishment of permanent linkage and
continuous interaction between extension and research has led to the
concentration of efforts in identifying and solving farmer's problems.
While project design had given due attention to the staffing levels of
extension personnel, extension/research linkages, provision (f equipment
and vehicles, this was not the case with regard to VEW qualifications and
training, staffing of research personnel and the implicationsP of the double
line of command.
6.02      Because the educational qualifications of the post of VEW was not
specified at appraisal, the newly established extension service seems to
have become the dumping ground for staff with minimum education during the
deployment exercise. As a result a substantial number of VEWs possess much



- 55 -
less than 10th grade certificates. A number of problems have resulted
which need addressing. These include the absorption capacity of the low
level staff for the technical messages they are expected to deliver, the
level of training during fortnightly training to classes comprising a vase
difference in educational levels, the prospects of advancement through
promotional courses for staff unqualified for entering universities, and
the confidence of poorly educated VEWs contacting farmers of superior
educational background.
A further shortcoming during appraisal was the arbitrary
designation of 60 SMS teams to look after 90 sub-divisions has become
difficult to manage. Likewise, adequate staff was not provided for the
universities with the assumption that the fbrthcoming National Agricultural
Research Project II would provide the necessary staff and other facilities,
but this did not happen as it stopped at the zonal Research station,
leaving out the districts.
Supervision
6.03     A total of 11 full supervision mission were fielded by IDa during
the implementation of the project. The composition of these missions was
in general satisfactory. With the exception of the last mission (18-20
February 1987), all missions included an extension specialist and had more
than one mission members. Continuity of staff between missions wa
satisfactory. The supervision mission have significantly contributed to a
smoother implementation of the project by explaining to the project staff
the extension methodology, project reporting methods and requirements and
by responding positively to some new requests deemed necessary by DOA; for
example the inclusion of addition staff and vehicles to the M&E unit. In
addition, the mission was continuously supporting the project to GOM for
resolution. Lack of examination of the basic qualification of the VEWs,
the function of the system under the ZP and late notification to GOM about
the inadequacy of financial reporting, can be considered to have been the
limitation of IDA supervision of the project.
VII. CONCLUSIONS
7.01     The project has achieved its main institutional objectives.  It
has succeeded in establishing a framewotk in agricultural extension based
on regular training and visit system. The project has also successfully
established a strong linkage between the extension service and agricultural
research, as a result of which farmers' problems are being addressed in a
more systematic manner. At completion. the T&V system is well understood
by all the extension staff. The regularity of visits and training as well
as the interaction with research staff and scientists have made technical
information more reality available to the extension staff. thus has
resulted in the upgrading of their knowledge and boosting their moral and
confidence.
7.02     The project is an institutions building type and the building type
and the building progress is still continuing. It is therefore too early
to evaluate its impact on the State's agricultural production. According
to the data compiled by the M&E Unit (Paragraph 5.3) however, it appears



- 56 -
that farmers are increasingly adopting new messages imparted by the
project, and thus increasing their crop yields and benefits.
7.03     Project design provided for a double line of command the T&V
system at the district level.  Accordingly the project has established
linkage with local governments by putting its district extension officers,
the PAO, under the administrative control of Zilla Parishad by being
answerable to the CEO. This was arranged with the understanding that the
extension staff would be working full-time on extension. In general this
wa; adhered to but there are instances where the CEO has instructed the FAO
and his staff to undertake non-extension or even non-agricultural works.
There is a feeling of some Government officials that during off seasons,
extension workers could be used elsewhere, forgetting that during this
period of time. refresher courses and other training programmes need to be
organised and also to advice on farms enterprise planning, land preparation
and soil conservation. The CEO should therefore not pressurise the
extension staff to undertake non-extension works, because it would put them
under divided loyalty and thus strain staff jeopardize the extension
service in the process.
7.04     Since the proiect has successfully put in place an organisational
structure suitable for practicing training and visit on a regular basis and
established a working linkage between extension and research. the farmers
are better served by the extension system. It is of paramount importance
to maintain the momentum gained in achieving a better service to farmers by
ensuring continued commitment of the staff to project. In this connection
DOA together with research needs to come up with imaginative approaches
geared towards developing technical packaged that are acceptable and within
the financial and technical reach of the farmers. Otherwise, repetitive or
unrealistic recommendations will lead to loss of farmer's interest in the
T&V system and VEWs may not command respect from the farmers. These could
result in a demoralised field staff. Some observations have already been
made in the State that recommendations have tended to become very general,
repetitive and in some instances costly and not commensurate with the risks
entailed in rainfed farming. The sustainability of the project will
greatly depend on the project's capability to understand farmer's problems
and capability to understand farmer's problems and capability and thus to
be able to solve their specific problems within the confines of his means.
Therefore an efficient feedback mechanism is necessary to enable research
to refine general recommendations to suit specific areas and problems.
7.05     The following issues wil]. have strong bearing on the future
performance of the extension service:
(a)  The continuation of the project along the lines established by
the T&V extension svstem:
(b)  Ensuring tull-time 'rrk of all 'xtonsion staff including the
senior staff at headquarters:
(c) Close monitoring of the Z.P. and extension staff relationship
with a view to safeguarding undue interference in the now-
regularized T&V extension system;



- 57 -
(d)  Improvement of the composition of VEWs with better educated
personnel in order to improve service to farmers by motivated
staff for future farmer development;
(e) Retension of experienced and trained extension staff by creating
promotion channels within the extension service:
(f) Review of the present training programmes and formulating of new
courses to take account of staff's educational background;
(g)  Early sanctioning of the identified vEW requirements to improve
the effectiveness of extension by adjusting the VEW farm families
ratio to the optimal level;
(h) Need for continuous generation of research recommendations based
on eco-units and farmers' resources; and
(i) Development of a system that would ensure an efficient process of
feedback from farmer through extension to research and vice-versa.

PROJECT COMPLETTON REPORT
Evaluation Summary
Introduction
1.         The Tamil Nadu Agricultural Extension Project was
executed between 1981 and 1987. The project was intended to
finance the reorganization and strengthening of the Department of
Agriculture (DOA) extension service based on the T&V approach. The
Credit closed on time in June 1987. Total project cost, estimated
at appraisal at USS 45.6 M was supported by an IDA Credit of US$
28.0 M (SDR 22.9 M). The credit amount was almost fully utilized
(99.7% was disbursed).
Protect Obhjatives and Rationale.
2.         The project intended to support the reorganization and
strengthening of the DOA extension service, aimed at establishing a
single line of command from the Director of Agriculture to the
Village Extension Workers (VEWs) through: consolidating staff from
special crop schemes into a unified extension service; hiring
additional staff: establishing the T&V methodology of extension;
supporting a variety of training programs; providing vehicles for
the different levels of staff; constructing staff housing; and
meeting other incremental costs of the DOA, including those for
setting up a monitoring and evaluation unit. Through improrements
in the extension service it was expected that agricultural
productivity and farm incomes would increase over time.
Project Implementation. Results and Sustainability
3.         The project has generally been successful in achieving
its broad objectives of reorganizing the extension service along
the lines of the T&V approach. The flow of technical information
to the farmers is regular and the link with research is firmly
rooted. Though there were delays in startup of the project,
staffing (inadequate numbers of qualified VEWs, staff from other
departments refusing to transfer, etc), provision of staff
transport (too low loan cielings), and the ci-il works component
(slow land aquisition and low priority given oy PWD), the project
was implemented largely as envisaged at appraisal. Construction of
80 information-cum-training centers not forseen at appraisal was
added to the project and financed from savings due to the
appreciation of the dollar.
4.         By the end of the project most staff had been appointed
and data from M&E surveys in 1985/86 show that adoption rates are
high. The extension service is paricularily proud of their



- 84 -
achievemOnts in peot surveillance and in cultivation methods for
paddy in the Thanjavur dolta in 1987, which saved the kharif season
paddy crop in that exceedingly dry year. Tarmers have alao
obtained substantial benefits from the mosagea and statistics show
increased use of inputs and highor yields whLeh in part can be
attributed to the projct. Zt is still too oarly to assess the
project's overall impact on productivity. fhe long term effect 0£
the project is expected to be positive and lead to increasingly
higher rates of adoption of new tachnologies. The momentum and
galn achieved will, however, require a continued comiittment to tho
program from higher level officals of tho state government and
managomont improvement to ensure the motivation of staff at the
field level. Moroover, the sust&inability of the improved
extension system would be enhanced by implomentation of furthew
institutional, administrative and policy reforms as outlined in
paras 7-9 of the PCR Overviow.
5.         The project benofittod from: (a) assistaneo to project
management by a high level coordination commnittoo which ensured
adequate allocation and releaso of funds for the project, and
asAaited in other areas such as site selection, allocation of
eomont, and other inter-departmental issues, tb) a strong rosearch-
extension link: (c) strong emphasis on comnunication tralning, and
(d) staff being oncouraged to be innovative in their approach to
extension work. Othor findingq and areas which need improvement
ares (a) staff transfer from other departments is a difficult issue
(b) loan ceilings for vehicle purchase need to be high enough to
ensure staff mobility (mopeda should also be included oince the
are preferred to bicycles), (e) site selection and design for clvil
works should be done before project effectiveness; and (d) more
imaginative technological packagoe and messages need to be
doveloped, which will enhanes the motivation of the field workers
and keep the interest of the farmers.

TAMIL NADU AGRICULTURAL EXTENSION PROJECT (Credit 1137-IN)
PROJECT COMPLETION REPORT
I, INTROP=CION
1.01     In its drive to boost agricultural development, the Government of
India (GOI) has been investing heavily in irrigation and in the production
and supply of other necessary agricultural inputs. In support to these
development efforts, Goverrunent of India in the mid 1970's, sought to re-
organize the State Extension Services with a view to providing farmers with
up-to-date advice on farming practices best suited to their specific
conditions on a regular and systematic manner. The programme of re-
organization and strengthening of the extension services was to be achieved
by strictly programmed visits from regularly trained field staff, supported
by professional advice from the Department of Agriculture and from
research. This system of agricultural extension, commonly known as
Training and Visit (T&V) system, was pioneered under the Rajasthan Canal
Command Area Development Project in 1974, with the assistance of the World
Bank. The result of this experience was positive and has led to the
expanded adoption of the Training and Visit system in the country.
1.02     The Tamil Nadu Agricultural Extension Project was started as the
tenth in a series of IDA assisted projects designed to re-organize and
strengthen agricultural extension in the State. This project was appraised
in 1980 and provided for the re-organization of the exlsting extension
system into a unified extension service under the Department of Agriculture
with a single line of command from the extension headquarters to a full
time village level extension worker. It also provided for an extension
programme of regular training and improved linkage between agricultural
extension and research. The project, which became effective in July 22,
1981, was completed in June 1986. This project Completion Report (PCR)
presents the implementation experience of the project as well as its
performance and impact on the State's agriculture. T.he report is based on
review of the Staff Appraisal Report, the Development Credit Agreement and
Project Agreement; World Bank supervision reports and project files;
progress reports prepared by the Monitorit4Z and Evaluation Unit; and
discussion with Project staff and farmers.
II. PROJECT FORMULATION
Proiect Preparation
2.01     The Government of Tamil Nadu has been experimenting use of
different types of extension system by re-organizing its extension service.
The latest re-organization before this project was carried out ir. the early
seventies and provided for the replacement of the multi-purpose village
level extension worker by several special crops schemes. After a review of
the crop specific extension system, it became apparent that this did not



- 86 -
fully meet the requirements of the agricultural sector. Following GOI
recommendations, and encouraged by the results of T&V system in other
States, GOTN decided t re-organize its extension service, by introducing
the T&V system with the assistance of the World Bank.
2.02     Project preparation was carried out by GOTN assisted by GOI
Extension Directorate and staff from New Delhi Office of the World Bank.
The preparation report was completed in early 1980. The main emphasis of
the preparation exercise was on the proposed re-organization of the DOA,
level of staffing and the integration of extension activities of the
different schemes. The preparation report had also outlined staffing
levels as well as housing, transport and other equipment requirements which
were refined later during appraisal. At preparation, the project was
estimated to cost about Rs.,Q    illion.
Appraisal
2.03     The project was appraised in October 1980 and the basic concept
and the main features of the project were similar to what had been proposed
during preparation. As appraised, the Project sought to achieve early and
sustained increases in agricultural production in Tamil Nadu's 15 districts
through the re-organization and strengthening of the extension services of
the Department of Agriculture (DOA) and the directorate of Horticulture
(Nilgiris District only). To this end, the project proposed to establish a
single line of command between full time village level extension worker
(VEW) and extension headquarters; to consolidate staff from the special
crop schemes of DOA into a single unified service; to incorporate regular
in service training as an integral part of the extension activities; and to
establish regular monitoring and evaluation procedures.
2.04     The project provided the following:
(a) recruitment of additional 1,351 VEW's, 182 Deputy Agricultural
Officers (DYAO), 140 Subject Matter Specialist (SMS) at sub-
Divisional and District levels, 39 Divisional Agricultural
Officers (DVAO), 12 Joint directors (JD) and one Assistant
Director of Agriculture at Headquarters;
(b) financing pre-service and in service training programmes for all
the T&V staff including higher level training within and outside
the State;
(c) construction of 1,750 houses for VEWs and DYAOs, one training
centre and a number of buildings to be used for horticultural
extension-Nilgiris District;
(d) purchase of 2,500 bicycles 830 motorcycles, 115 four-wheel drive
vehicles, 19 vans; 12 sedans and other equipment and furniture;
and
(e) financing incremental operating expenses.
The project, to be implemented over a five year period, was estimated to
cost Rs. 364.8 million or US$45.6 million and provided for an IDA credit of
US$28.0 million.



- 87 -
2.05     The overall responsibility for the project was vested wit:-i
Secretary of Agriculture and Director of Agriculture and Horticulture.
However, for the day-to-day operations and management of the T&V both
technically and administratively, the position of an Additional Director of
Agriculture (Extension) (ADDLDA EXT) was created under the project.  He '.
to be responsible for management of all activities under the system at the
headquarters and was to be assisted by 7 Subject Matter Specialist (SM) ^
different specializations. His responsibilities included improving the
technical quality of extension, training and promoting linkages between
extension and research. He was to be supported by a small administrative
and accounting staff.
2.06     At the district level, the Joint Director of Agriculture (JD) was
responsible for extension operations throughout the district and was
answerable to the ADDLDA (Extension). the JD was to be assisted by a
Deputy Director of Agriculture (DDA) and 3 SMS to review, plan, discuss and
coordinate extension activities in the district. Each of the 6-11 sub-
divisions in the district was to be headed by a DVAO/ADA.i/ Each DVAO was
to be in charge of 6-10 circles each headed by an Agricultural Officer (AO)Z/
who would be responsible for 5-8 VEWsl/ The DVAO was to be s'upported by a
technical staff of 3 SMSs, who, among other things were to be rasoonsible
for conducting fortnightly training of VEWs. Each VEIU was to fallow a
fixed schedule of four nightly visits to specific groups of farmers and
training courses conducted by the AOs and SMSs.
2.07     By establishing a single line of command from headquarters to che
village level the Project aimed at making field level staff accau-nzable to
their supervisors both technically and administratively. Researzn was made
the responsibility of the Tamil Nadu agricultural University (T.NJ), while
training was to be implemented jointly by DOA and TNAU. To facilizate
project implementation a high level Project Coordination Committee (?CC)
chaired by the Secretary of Agriculture, was to be established. Membership
included representatives of TNAU, DOA, and other concerned Covernmenc
Departments and agencies including Finance, Irrigation, Cooperatives and
input supply agencies. Similarly, for planning of programmes .o be
implemented under the Project, the project proposed the establishment of
different levels of technical committees as detailed in Chapter ,V.
III. PROJECT IMPLEMENTATION
Project Commencement
3.01     Although the Project became effective in July 1981, field
implementation started only in October mainly due to staff-related
problems. One of those problems was the unwillingness of the VEWs to
transfer from the Rural Development Department to DOA. Nevertheless, bv
October the Project succeeded to overcome the difficulties. Yost of the
Phase I staff had been converted and positioned in the field, starting
I/  Sub-divisional Agricultural Officers (SDAO) of the rank of Assistant
director of Agriculture (ADA).
_.1  AOs were graduates but non-graduates performing similar aztivities were
designated as Deputy Agricultural Officers (DYAO).
J  VEWs occupied the rank of Assistant Agricultural Officers (A.AG).

immediately to undertake the scheduled visits and required training.
During this time orders were also placed for vehicle requirements for the
first phase of the project and designs of Civil Works and their cost
estimates had been finalized. Due to outstanding issues concerning staff,
crop coverage and faxm family to VEW ratio, the Horticulture component did
not start until January 1982.
Proiect Revisions
3.02     The main change introduced in the Project concerned the ratio
between VEW and Farm families which was designed to be 1:800 at appraisal.
During implementation, when DOA realized that the expected transfer of VEWs
from the Department of Rural Development (DRD) to its extension personnel
would not take place, it decided not to recruit additional VEWs; but to
increase instead the ratio of VEW and farm families to slightly over
1:1000. Other revisions were the increase in the number of extension
districts from 15 to 19, the down scaling of Civil Works in Horticulture
extension and the construction of additional 80 information-cum-Training
Centres at the sub-divisions which were not foreseen at appraisal.
Re-organization of Extension:
3.03     Project implementation was to begin in 7 of 14 districts plus
Nilgiris (see map) in the first year and in the other 7 in the second year.
There was a slight delay of about 3 months in starting. Once started,
there were few problems of senior staff postings since there had been in
existence special schemes with ample numbers of staff. Positions of JDs -
ADAs - and SMS, were immediately filled for the first phase through staff
deployment and promotions. By 1st September 1981 most Senior level staff
were in position in the first phase districts. Before initiation of T&V
system, however orientation courses were organized, with the assistance of
the Bank Office in Delhi in February/March 1982, for all state level
graduate staff earmarked for the extension service.
3.04     Procurement of vehicles and equipment was initiated on schedule
although some problems were encountered in loans for VEWs. Training of the
first batch of VEWs were started at Kudumiamalai in November 1981 and
continued satisfactorily. Similarly, once staff were in position, research
and extension linkages were initiated by inauguration of monthly zonal
workshops at each district.
3.05     The second phase in the remaining 7 districts started, as
scheduled in July 1982. Here again no serious problems were encountered in
senior staff postings, procurement, training and in the inauguration of
monthly Zonal workshops.
3.06     Some problems were however encountered with regard to staffing at
the VEW/AAO level, construction of staff houses and office buildings and to
utilization of loans for the purchase of 2-wheeled vehicles for AOs and
VEWs. These problems and how they were overcome are discussed under
separate headings below.
3.07     Since the T&V System was dependent on contact farmers (CF) and
their selection, although this was done before the initiation of field
visits, representation was biased towards farmers with irrigation
facilities and against small farmers. Bank supervision mission pointed out
these failures which were later put right.



- 89 -
3.08     During fiscal year 1984-1985, the district of Ramanathapuram was
broken up into three districts and that of Madurai was broken up into two
districts in 1985-86. In 1986-87, Tirunelveli District was broken up into
two districts from 15 to 19. Although the ground level organization or
circle and Sub-divisions existed, the need for providing for additional
full complement of management staff arose. Directorate of Horticulture
however decided to man only one new district.
Staffing
3.09     At appraisal, staff requirements for the T&V system was expected
to come from (a) redeployment of staff within DOA and DOH; (b) transfer of
Village Level Extension Workers (VLW) from DRD and (c) hiring of 1,351 new
VEWs. The transfer of VLWs. from DRD to DOA was a condition of invitation
to negotiations and therefore GOTN issued an order for the transfer of 513
positions from DRD to DOA in September 1980. Staffing details are given in
Table 4.
3.10     When the project started, 378 VLWs, transferred but the remainder
refused to do so. DRD also had a number of schemes for which they needed
the manpower. In the wake of ensuing court actions, DOA agreed even to
send back the 378 who did transfer and it resorted to redeployment of
staff, upgrading demonstrators to fill in the vacancies and recruitment
from the open market. Open market recruitment was also restricted to
availability by the availability of trained staff. Only two institutions
existed in the State for turning out agricultural diplomats at a rate of
about 100/year. The end result of these initial problems was that at
project completion there were 4,000 VEWs at post compared with the
appraisal estimate of 4,777 (i.e. an achievement of 84%).
3.11     The recruitment of graduate level staff was dependent on the turn-
out from TNAU, which was satisfactory for project needs. By project
completion most graduate staff positions had been filled despite the
increase in number of districts. The number of posts was more than
estimated at appraisal because of the increase in the number of districts
and additional positions created at headquarters.
3.12     The decrease in the number of VEWs resulted in a decrease in the
ratio of VEW per farm family from the appraised target of 1:800 to 1:1,050.
This wider coverage of VEWs does not seem to have had any negative
influence on project performance and impact and DOA intends to maintain
this ratio. Any future increased in the number of district would only
require increased in the JDA and district SMS posts, sin'e at the around
level the basic staff needs for the whole State have been met.
Training
3.13     A number of training courses were provided for under the project.
These may be divided into training provided by TNAU, those provided by DOA
and promotional and overseas training courses.
3.14     TNAU was to be responsible mainly for training of graduate level
staff i.e. AO and SMS. DOA was responsibJ.e 1.a-
orientation, and refresher courses f-
to be deputized for promotional courseb a:: 'S.. SS



- 90 -
both within the country and outside. Provision was also made for overseas
study tours. These courses were in addition to the normal fortnightly
training courses for VEWs and monthly Zonal Workshops.
3.15     From Table 5, which gives the annual training performance for
different categories of staff, it is clear that TNAU managed to achieve in
targets, except in promotional courses, which was due to the entry
requirements demanded for graduate and post graduate training courses.
Problems were also encountered in these course because of difficulties in
finding universities in other States for trainees, delays in obtaining
sanctions from GOTN and, sometimes, the need to retain staff at posts to
oversee important functions.
3.16     DOA's achievements fell below appraisal estimates due to:  (a)
refresher training and special short courses of VEWs were not undertaken
during the first 2 years of the project because of inadequate facilities at
the State Level Training Institute at Kudumiamalai (SLTI) and (b) lower
than appraisal requirements of VEWs. The Institute also faced problems of
high staff turn over because of lack of incentives. This resulted in
inadequate staff required for monitoring special courses.
3.17     Although late in starting, overseas training courses were provided
for 20 staff members, as against 18 as appraised, as follows:
Nine for various courses in Korea,
Philippines and Indonesia. Two for Water
Management in USA and Nine for rice
promotion technology at IRRI.
Fortniehtlv Iraining
3.18     This programme was started early during implementation and, with
the guidance of Bank supervision missions, has improved significantly with
time. Site selection for training was important to provide practical
training. As such these have been held on research stations, State Seed
Farms or on Farmers holdings where neither of the former two exist.
Participation of district SMSs has been satisfactory.
Fortnightlv Planning and Review Programme
3.19     These have also developed into institutions for development of
improved approaches to T&V. The programme has developed a 5 step approach
to the planning of activities. These are:
(a) Planning of agricultural production for the villages;
(b) Planning of water resources management programmes;
(c) Planning of specific production campaigns;
(d) Planning of demonstrations; and
(e,  Planning of integrated pest control programmes.
This planning process results in feedback from the field an strengthens the
fortnightly VEW training programme.



- 91 -
3.20     All the various training programmes were undertaken also in DOH.
However overseas training could not be obtained for the department's
candidates because of bureaucratic procedures and institutions providing
them. Nevertheless 7 Horticultural Officers, 3 sub-divisional officers
(ADHs) and 1 District Level SMS were deputed for Post graduate studies.
Civil Works
3.21     This component took a long time to take off and it as not until
about 1984 that it started to move. The reasons for this delay were the
slowness of procedures in getting Public Works Department (PWD) in
accepting the responsibility for overseeing construction of the large
number of scattered project works in addition to its were encountered in
selecting the appropriate sites. It was envisaged at appraisal that staff
houses should be in or near villages close to VEW's area of work. However,
since the land was to be obtained free of cost from community/Government
land, it was not always possible to get appropriate sites easily. In early
1983 a bi-monthly inter-departmenzal meeting between PUD and DCA was
instituted and agreements reached in procedures which allowed for closer
cooperation among the DOA, PWD and District Collectors. This resulted in
speeding up construction.
3.22     The inter-departmental meetings thus succeeded in removing
problems of communications and not only were appropriate sites agreed on
but preparation of tender documents and contracts were awarded for those
areas where site selection did not pose any difficulty. Major problems
were referred to the PCC which also lent its weight on site selection
officials of concerned government Departments and District Administ-ations.
By 1984-85 most of the site selection problems had been resolved. For
areas where appropriate sites were not found (about 200 houses) it was
decided to construct twin buildings to serve more than one village.
3.23     As the construction programme gathered momentum, shortage of
cement was experienced because the annual quota allocated for the project
was sufficient. The problems was however resolved quickly by the
Government which either increased the quota or authorized purchases of
cement outside the quota system. Implementation of this component
therefore remained far behind schedule for a considerable time. No
building was completed in the first 3 years of the project and only 88 out
of 1,750 were constructed in fiscal 1984-85. Buc implementation speeded up
from 1985-86 onwards when about 600 houses were constructed in that year
alone (Table 10). The DOA suggested and IDA approved the construction of
information-cum-training centres out of the savings in civil works at a
cost of Rs. 640 lakhs. This was done in the year 1986. This
infrastructure is really helping to provide information support to farmers
and training of extension workers with the modern electronic gadgets.
3.24     The construction programme is now completed.  The quality of
construction is generally satisfactory. Local contractors who undertook
the construction have followed the specifications given by PWD.
Vehicles and Eguipment
3.25     Project vehicles were purchased more or less on schedule with the
exception of bicycles and motorcycles, where the first year purchase
slipped into the next year (Table 11). The number of vehicles purchased at



- 92 -
project completion were slightly more than appraisal estimates mainly as
the result of the increase of the number of districts by 4 which
ntecessitated a supply of additional vehicles to the new offices. About 42
trailers were also purchased for use in transporting equipment and
materials in the sub-divisions.  The loan facilities for purchase of
motorcycles and bicycles could not be fully utilized because of steep
increase in prices which did not cover the loan provision of Rs. 6,000 per
motorcycle and Rs. 600 per bicycle. Even though loan ceilings were later
raised to Rs. 8,000 and Rs. 800 respectively for motorcycles and bicycles,
the demand from staff was not sufficient to make use of the project
provision. Moreover, VEWs preferred mopeds to bicycles for which rules did
not provide. This matter will1 be given due consideration in the future.
3.26     Other office and audio-visual aids have been purchased as
envisaged at appraisal. However, because of the increase in the number of
districts, and the construction of 80 new Information-cum-Training Centres,
purchases increased accordingly. No difficulties of relevance were
encountered in purchasing project equipment.
Monitoring and Evaluation
3.27     A Monitoring and Evaluation (M&E) Unit was proposed as an integral
part of the Project with the aim of providing management with information
on both the progress of implementation and of the effectiveness of the T&V
System. Information was to be gathered through a series of annual overall
M&E studies and special specific studies depending on needs. It was to be
headed by a Director and assisted by four Specialists (Statistician,
Economist, Rural Sociologist and a head in charge of special studies) and
four technical Assistants at headquarters and 14 Supervisors and 56
Investigators at the field level. Provision was also made for supporting
staff at headquarters (See Table 4 for proposed and actual staffing of the
Unit).
3.28     There was a slight delay in obtaining Government approval for
setting up the Unit, but by the end of 1982, most of the headquarters staff
were in place and enough field staff had been assembled to carry out survey
and analytical activities in four districts. By the end of FY 82-83 two
monitoring surveys were completed ir 5 districts and one monitoring-cum-
evaluation survey as well as the baseline studies had been completed in the
first phase districts. -
3.29     The main problems encountered during this period was the
unavailability of enough field staff positions especially field
investigators, lack of continuity in the position of head of the Unit.
inadequate mobility, lack of appropriate training of M&E staff and undue
delays in compilation of data and production of reports. A problem
affecting mainly the quality of work was that of filling that post of
Agricultural Economist and later, that of Rural Sociologist. Thus staffing
was not fully resolved until the fiscal 1985-86 when the Unit was able to
acquire its full complement of staff.
3.30     Not withstanding these problems the volume and quality of work
continued to expand and improve over the project period. By project
completion a large number of valuable reports have been produced as shown
in Tables 7 and 8. The Monitoring and Evaluation (M&E) Unit has carried
out 9 monitoring Surveys and 6 monitoring-cum-evaluation surveys (Table 7).



- 93 -
In addition it undertook 26 Special studies which cover a wid& range of
agricultural topics (Table 8). These surveys and studies have been useful
to the project because they brought new information either as added
knowledge or a information necessary for follow-up actions in the field.
Other Studies
3.31     In addition to the studies carried out by the M&E Unit, two
studies have also been conducted by the Directorate of Evaluation and
Applied research on behalf of DOA. The first study was the base line
survey conducted in two phases. Phase 1, carried out in December 1981 and
January 1982, covered 8 districts while Phase 2, carried out in November
1982 and January 1983, covered the remaining 7 districts. The same
institutions also understood the mid-terms survey during Khariff 1985/86 in
the districts of Coimbatore, Madurai and Thanjavur. The report on the mid-
term survey was completed only in April 1987.  DOA is satisfied with these
studies and has considered them as useful for its future work.
Procurement
3.32     As envisaged by the Development Credit Agreement, contracts were
awarded on the basis of competitive bidding following local advertisement.
Contracts for Civil works or for equipment and furniture estimated to cost
US$100,000 were reviewed by IDA both before bids were invited and contracts
awarded. All vehicles, with the exception of motorcycles and bicycles,
have been procured in accordance with existing Government procedures.
Motorcycles and bicycles for the field staff were however purchased under
loan on personal basis. Minor equipment were bulked and procured through
local bidding procedures except where the value was less than US$50,000
when they were purchased by prudent shopping. Since most of the items were
locally manufactured and the DOA was used to these procedures, no serious
procurement problems were encountered.
Proiect Costs
3.33     At completion project costs have been estimated at Rs. 431.3
million (US$37.8 million) against appraisal estimates of Rs. 364.8 million
(US$45.6 million). These are about 118% (83% in US$ terms) of the
appraisal estimates. An 18% cost overrun in Rupee terms can be considered
a remarkable achievement taking into account the delays experienced in the
civil works component and the addition of 80 buildings for use as
information-cum-training centres and the purchase of more vehicles and
equipment. The lower costs in US$ terms are the result of the appreciation
of the USS since appraisal. Current exchange rate is Rs. 12.90 per US$
against the appraisal rate of RS 0.00 per US$. Details on annual costs and
comparison between appraisal estimates and actuals are shown in Table I
and 2.
Disbursements
3.34     Credit disbursement started exceedingly well and was more than
double of the appraisal estimates for fiscal year 1982 and about equal to
appraisal estimates in 1983. This was due to rapid procurement of
equipment and vehicles, supplemented by costs of newly recruited staff.
From 1984 to 1986, however, disbursement lagged behind appraisal estimates;
dropping to 56%, 46% and 55% at the end of the fiscal years of 1984, 1985



- 94 -
and 1986 respectively. Th- decline was due to the sloe progress of the
Civil works Component and to the appreciation US dollar Vis-a-Vis the
Rupee. Although i: was understood that the completion of the civil works
component would improve the disbursement rate towards the end of project
implementation, it was clear that all the credit would not be utilized
because of the US$ appreciation. Efforts were therefore made to improve
credit utilization. These included the construction of Information-cum-
Training Centres in 80 sub-divisions and additional expenditure on vehicles
and equipment for the newly created districts. A'l these actions boosted
disbursement rate to 94% by October 1987 and the rate is expected to
increase slightly as some reimbursement application have not yet been
processed. Details on annual disbursement are shown in Table 3.
IV. INSTITUTIONAL PERFORMANCE AND DEVELOPMENT
Installation of T&V Extension System
4.01     The DOA started to implement the reorganization of its extension
service in a rationale and systematic way because it undertook the
necessary administrative preparations before the project start-up. Thus
the project succeeded in establishing the basic extension structure as
planned at appraisal without much difficulty. Project Management guided
the project staff in the best possible way to adjust during extraordinary
times when field staff strength was not complete and later when the
district were increased by four. Active collaboration with the research
and extension wings of TNAU was established almost immediately when the
project started. Performance of the field staff in their different roles
has been commendable as was their reLations with farmers and research
staff. On top of the regular training and visit activities, the project
has been producing publicity materials in the districts and distributing
them. TNAU also uses different forms of media, particularly the radio, to
reach a wider audience.
Project Coordination
4.02     The State level project Co-ordination Committee met 9 times during
the Project implementation (Table 9). Although the number of meetings were
less than what had been envisaged at appraisal, i.e. two times a year, the
committee has been extremely helpful in solving problems which were beyond
the ability of DOA to solve. The committee has been successful in tackling
difficulties in the procurement of sites for project buildings, in
expediting re:ease of funds, increasing annual budget when necessary and
increasing the availability of Cement to the project. Frequent
difficulties with the construction of civil works had put strain both to
the DOA and PWD, which could not tackle them individually. An inter-
departmental meeting was therefore established between the two where they
have jointly addressed the problems at the departmental and field levels.
Since the es-:ablishment of the inter-diepartmencal meetings in April 1983,
the civil works component started to move particularly in the acquisition
of sites. Decisions were also taken at this meeting to construct twin
houses once *t was realized that appropriate public sites were not
available.



95 -
Research-Extension Linkage
4.03     Prior to the initiation of the project, DOA was responsible for
research in a number of crops on 25 locations scattered through the state
while TNAU, in addition to its teaching activities, conducted research on
its two main campus at Coimbatore and Madurai and on 10 out-reach stations
and sub-centres. Just prior to appraisal Government of Tamil Nadu
transferred all research activities to TNAU and a member of DOA Research
staff came under the jurisdiction of TNAU. To achieve the aims of rapid
transfer of technology from research to farmers through the T&V system a
strong link between extension and research became essential. The former
links between extension and research were maintained. These links were
representation of research and extension personnel in the TNAU's Research
Advisory Committee or Annual Scientific Worker's Conference and DOS's
Extension Education Council. Closer working relations between research
workers and extension staff, particularly Subject Matter Specialist, were
established through a number of regular meetings for inter-change of ideas
and cross-fertilization (Table 6).
4.04     The most important forum was the Monthly Zonal Workshop which in
Tamil Nadu was held at the district level because each district had at
least one research station with different staff specializations. In
addition one special research team was established in each of the 19
districts to participate fully in these workshops which were attended by
Agricultural Officers and Subject Matter Specialist at the district and
sub-divisional levels. These workshops were off the ground early and have
developed into forums where often heated but frank and friendly discussions
between scientists and field staff took place and location specific
technologies were developed for the two fortnights of the month for use in
training VEWs at fortnightly meetings.
4.05     For joint planning of research and extension activities, the
Regional Research Extension Advisory Committee, was started with the
establishment of the National Agricultur_l Research Project; it consists of
scientists from the Zone, Directors of University, campuses as well as
senior extension staff and serves as the place where district programmes
and research priorities are discussed, priorities and approved and, where
necessary, refined/modified and returned to the districts for submission to
the State Technical Committees. The Zonal committee met twice a year,
prior to the beginning of each planting season. Meetings have been regular
and have continued to be refined with experience.
4.06     Perhaps among the other areas of cooperation and inter-change of
ideas the introduction of the diagnostic team approach to solving location
specific problems has been the most useful since it entails periodic visits
to problem areas to find solutions to production problems of various kinds
whiie documenting farmers' practices and innovations and feeding back
unsolved problems to research.
4.07     Research workers and field staff have also joined hands to assess
the benefits or otherwise of specific recommendations through visits (at
least twice in the season) for newly introduced innovations.
4.08     Research has also developed for extension to farmers, a number of
new technologies which include the increasing use of bio-fertilizers, use
of micro-nutrients such as ferric sulphate, calcium sulphate and zinc



- 96 -
sulphate, improved water management technology such as the use of cross-
furrows in land preparation, optimum plant population for different
ecologies and, most significantly,.pest and disease surveillance for
economic an deficient use of pesticides. This last program is reported to
have saved the state an estimated 10 million rupees during the last
financial year alone. Also being developed as an integrated pest control
approach to reduce the incidence of pests and diseases.
4.09     Last but not least of the achievements of research in linkages
with extension and farmers has been the volume of information emanating
from both TNAU and Department of Agriculture in terms of production
practices for various crops and training material for all levels of staff.
Various forms of information media have been used i.e. t.v., radio,
newspaper, pamphlets, bill boards, stickers and even games played in rural
homes.
Accounts and Reporting
4.10     An IDA financial analyst visited the project in June 1982 and
reported that DOA has maintained identifiable project accounts. during
this visit further requirements in mairtaining the project accounts and in
reporting/auditing the expenditures were also explained. There were,
therefore, no difficulties faced with regard to accounting. Difficulties
were however encountered in the.reporting auditing of project accounts in
that they were carried out after long delays. GOTN was in arrears in
submitting audit certificates for the statement of expenditure throughout
the project period. Some of the certificates presented were incomplete.
After several reminders to rectify the situation, IDA was forced to stop
disbursement until the submission of the certified statements of
expenditure. These were submitted on 16th March 1987 and they enabled IDA
to resume disbursement.
4.11     Apart from the financial reporting, GOTN was also expected to
submit to IDA two reports i.e. annual monitoring and evaluation summaries
and six monthly progress reports. Submission of these to IDA was regular,
except for one or two cases of delays, and can be considered satisfactory.
Comgliance with Covenants
4.12     GOTN has complied with most of the major covenants, although in
some instances there were excessive delays such as in submitting audit
certificates for the settlement of expenditures. This was complied with
only towards the end of project implementation. Due to strong resistance
by VLWs, the GOTN has not succeeded in complying with the covenant that
required the transfer of VLW from DRD to DOA. Likewise, GOTN could not
recruit all the staff agreed to at appraisal as it considers the current
number sufficient and just within its capacity to fund annually.
V. PROJECT IMPACT
General
5.01     Because of the complementarity of different Agricultural inputs,
it is difficult to pin-point separately the contribution of extensior, to
increased crop yields. In addition, an extension project of this type is



-97-
essentially an institution strengthening process of considerable magnitude
and as such requires several years after its implementation before its
major impact is felt. Nevertheless, it is possible even at this stage, to
discern, from available national data, some positive effects. These data
include the number of farmers who are adopting extension messages and the
state-wide increase in crop production.
Adogtion of Extension Messages
5.02     According to the H&E unit of the project, farmers have been very
receptive to the messages imparted by the VEWs. Surveys carried out
between 83/84 and 84/86 showed that adoption rate for critical messages for
paddy. Groundnut and Cotton has been high (Table 12). For instance, in
1985-86, all farmers surveyed (2,936) reported using improved cotton
varieties and adopted the recommended optimum groundnut population. High
adoption rates are also reported for several messages and no adoption rate
was below 74%, with the exception of DAP application in paddy and basal
application of fertilizer for cotton, which were 59% and 52% respectively.
Farmers have further reported that they have obtained substantial benefits
from these messages as expected. State Statistics also show a higher
increased use of fertilizer and pesticides (Tables 13 & 14)
Impact on Productivity
5.03     The evolution of rolling average yields (i.e. Yields representing
averages over 3 years periods) are shown in Tables 15 and 16, which shows
that although yields have been fluctuating over the past 10 years, figures
for the last two years, which represent yields over much of the
implementation period have risen significantly. In terms of physical
yields, it may be deduced that paddy, millets, pulses, cotton, groundnut
and oilseeds have increased by 293 kg/ha (in terms of rice), 21 kg/ha, 101
kg/ha, 88 kg/ha, 35 kg/ha and 40 kg/ha.  These increases have been achieved
through increased agricultural practices part of which is attributable to
this project. Although the level of the contribution of extension cannot
be known precisely only a small proportion attributed to the project would
suffice to make it economically viable because of its relatively low costs.
Total project cost at current prices amount to Rs. 103/Farm Family and Rs.
62/ha. of total cultivable area. In terms of annual recurrent costs, based
on 1987-88 budget figures, costs would be Rs. 32/-per farm family and Rs.
19/- per ha.
VI.  IDA PERFORMANCE
General
6.01     IDA's assistance in the re-organization of the extension service
was an important contribution to the agricultural development of the State.
It was also timely in that, if took place during a period of time when the
limitation of the special crop extension schemes in terms of area coverage
and other short-comings were becoming apparent. IDA has been active since
project preparation in assisting GOTN and indicating the approaches adopted
in earlier extension projects in other States. The IDA Appraisal mission
which visited the State for about a week, concluded that the preparation
works was satisfactory and recommended an early implementation of the
project. The appraisal mission, perhaps considering the project as a
repeater of other extension projects, might have overlooked the need for



- 98 -
detailing certain proposals. In retrospect it can be said that the
appraisal mission should have known from past experiences of the
difficulties experienced in the transfer of VLWs to DOA in other States and
should not have placed so much reliance on augmenting VEW strength from
transfer of VLWs. Thus despite GOTN's compliance with this condition for
negotiations, some VLWs still refused to transfer, threatening to take
legal action against GOTN. Likewise, the appraisal mission should have
satisfied itself on the availability of land for the construction of field
staff housing and also on the designs, particularly, since DOA wanted
housing within villages. These issues posed major problems during project
implementation, and could have been avoided.
Sunervision
6.02     IDA fielded a total of 11 supervision mission between October 1981
and February 1987. The composition of these mission were technically
satisfactory. All missions had at least one extension specialist and
continuity of staff between missions has been generally maintained. The
supervision missions have been extremely helpful in assisting the project
staff in solving their problems at the field level, particularly in the
early stages of project implementation. The missions were also active in
pointing out problems which required management attention by indicating the
best ways of solving them.  Issues concerning the delayed recruitment of
staff, particularly, the VEWs, and those concerning the poor progress in
the civil works component were consistently referred to GOTN.
VII.  CONCLUSIONQ
7.01     The project has been successful in achieving its broad objectives.
The agricultural extension service has been re-organized along the intended
lines of training and visit system which is now well understood by all
extension and research staff. Through this system, the project has given
the necessary technical skills to the staff who can now, on their own, give
technical advice to farmers with full confidence. The project also
succeeded making the flow of technical information regular by establishing
a solid link between extension and research and ensuring continuous
dialogue. This linkage has resulted in a joint effort between extension
and research in understanding farmers problems and accordingly in
programming their work towards solving these problems. In addition, the
extension service has succeeded in establishing strong information service
units in each district which is capable of producing publicity and training
material not only for the use of the field staff and their contact farmers,
but also for dissemination to the general public in the rural areas.
Publicity materials and messages to be used by the media are also produced
by the project and divulgated in the State.
7.02 '   At project completion, the impact of the project should be judged
mainly in terms of its success in introducing the training and visit system
and whether the system is understood by all the staff and is operating
well. Because the project was an institutions building type, it is still
too early to warrant a full judgement on its impact on agricultural
productivity. Nevertheless, some indications show that farmers are
adopting messages imparted by the project and are also benefitting from
them.



- 99 -
7.03     Although the project has recorded several achievements two of them
stand out so outstandingly that they warrant particular highlighting.
There are:
(a) the establishment of the pest surveillance system with the
involvement of farmers and field staff on such a systematic way
that any attack beyond a certain threshold can be relayed to DOA
and TNAU within a day for action; and
(b) the use of the extension service by DOA in kharif 1987 to
disseminate rapidly GOTN's decision to undertakp direct seeding of
paddy in the delta area instead of waiting for the delayed rains
in order to transplant. This seemingly annual practice in the
areas has been readily accepted by a large majority of farmers,
thereby saving the kharif paddy crop.
7.04     The reasons for the successful introduction of the training and
visit extension system as well as its satisfactory operation are numerous.
However, the points listed below appear to have contributed markedly to the
success of the project:
(a) Strong Government support which enabled the project to obtain all
the necessary funds on time, even in some instances more than its
annual allocation;
(b) The active assistance to project management by the State level Co-
ordination Committee which was able to solve problems faced by the
project by seeking the concurrence of other Government
Departments;
(c) Strong linkage established between extension and research which
developed naturally because the extension staff and the regional
research stations staff were part and parcel of the DOA before
they were transfered to TNAU in 1981. This feature has been
extremely important because staff of both extension and research
felt they belonged to each other and establishing strong link with
ex-colleagues was not difficult;
(d) The possibility created for DOA to develop its own training
programmes, and impart them themselves at the State Level Training
Institute, Kudumianmalai, made it possible for OOA to give strong-
emphasis to communication in its training programme, thereby
enabling the institute to turn out very good extension workers.
(e) The non-interference from locally elected leaders in the work of
the field workers since the Panchayat system has not been
operational for the past 10 years; and
(f) Staff at all levels have been encouraged to introduce new ideas
into their work if these were found effective in promoting more
effective extension system.
The achievements made and the momentum gained by the project will
require continued commitment and support by the Government and the DOA.
Staff motivation in imparting useful extension messages should be
maintained. Greater imagination will be necessary in refining existing



- 100 -
messages and in developing new ones. This will enhance the motivation of
field extension workers and the interest of farmers in the project.
