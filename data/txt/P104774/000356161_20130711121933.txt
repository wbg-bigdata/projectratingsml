       Project Development Objectives (from Project Appraisal Document)
       The objective of the project is to accelerate the implementation of reforms and
       restructuring of EdL by enhancing the capacity of MOEW, EdL and the multi-ministry
       higher level committee.

       Revised Project Development Objectives (as approved by original approving authority)

       Below are the PDO and intermediate indicators of the post 2010 project restructuring,
       which were aimed at clarifying and making more measureable the original ones. The
       indicators dropped during the 2010 restructuring can be found in Annex 7.

   1. Project Context, Development Objectives and Design

   1.1 Context at Appraisal

   1.      In 2006, during the preparation of this project, the Lebanese electricity sector had
   not been able to resume sustainable reliable and affordable electricity services throughout
   Lebanon since the end of the 1975-1990 civil war. Lebanon’s electricity sector suffered
   from years of overall poor governance, weak institutional, management and technical
   capacity, and a serious lack of investment in operation and maintenance as well as in new
   infrastructure. This had led to poor quality of service, low consumer confidence in public
   service provision, high cost of electricity and inadequate cost-recovery.

   2.      The main consequences were a considerable dependence of the sector on
   budgetary subsidies estimated by the Ministry of Finance at close to US$1 billion in 2006.
   In addition, there were high additional costs borne by users through private generators to
   compensate for the unreliability of power supply.

3. The main outstanding issues in 2007 can be grouped as follows:
        a. The cost of electricity generation was high because of lack of access to natural
            gas for power generation. In addition, plant efficiency was below normal levels
            due to poor maintenance, poor control of fuel stocks and consumption, and an
            ad hoc dispatch to meet demand.
        b. The reliability of supply was poor. The available generation capacity was
            significantly below the demand and the transmission network was fraught with
            inefficiencies. The main 220kV backbone grid was not fully completed, nor
            was the long-planned national load control center in place. Major investments
            were also required in the medium- and low-voltage transmission and
            distribution (T&D) systems, as well as in metering to account for and
            ultimately reduce T&D losses.
        c. Metering, billing and collection were highly inefficient. Technical losses were
            estimated at about 15%, and commercial losses from illegal connections were
            estimated at 18%. In reality, out of the 67% of the power produced that EdL
            managed to bill for, about 90% on average was eventually collected annually.
        d. EdL’s management systems were outdated and ineffective. Accounting and
            financial reporting systems were not functioning adequately and did not allow
            the annual closing of EdL’s account or their auditing. The consumer
            management system was not reliable while the human resources management
            system was also ineffective.

   4.      Aiming to solve all these challenges, an Electricity Law (Law 462) was passed in
   2002. This Law laid out the restructuring of EdL, and called for the creation of a
   regulatory authority, unbundling of all or parts of the sector, incorporation of the new
   entities under commercial law, and, ultimately, privatization of up to 40% of the shares.
   Since the Law was enacted, several attempts were made to advance its implementation,
   but as of 2006, there had been no change to the structure or status of EdL. In addition, for
   the law to be effective, some decrees needed to be approved.


                                               15
5.      On July 6, 2006 the Council of Ministers approved a reform program aimed at
addressing the most critical problems and achieving the quickest improvements possible.
The ultimate objective was to turn the sector around through private sector participation,
in accordance with Law 462. While there was recognition that full privatization would be
difficult within the context of significant dependence of the sector on large subsidies and
the political economy of reforms, several steps were proposed to commence the
turnaround of the sector, including restructuring and incorporation under commercial law
and outsourcing to the private sector of key functions.

6.      However, when the July-August 2006 Israeli war broke out, the electricity sector
reform program was put aside as more urgent priorities took over. The hostilities resulted
in serious human and physical infrastructure losses in Lebanon. The direct damage was
estimated by the World Bank (WB) at about US$2.4 billion with a further US$700-$800
million of indirect damage.

7.      In September 2006, the Bank’s Board of Governors had approved a transfer of
US$ 70 million from IBRD surplus to a Trust Fund for Lebanon (TFL) (Resolution 580)
to support the GoL’s reconstruction efforts. Bank support was to be centered on priority
areas where the Bank had a distinct comparative advantage, namely the rehabilitation of
damaged infrastructure, support to groups affected by the hostilities and jump-starting of
economic activities. The Bank’s short-term emergency response to the post-hostility
needs centered on undertaking an economic and social impact assessment (ESIA) which
outlined key reform elements necessary for transitioning from short-term reconstruction
to sustainable growth. This ESIA included a comprehensive chapter on the electricity
sector.

8.      The political situation in Lebanon continued to be tense during appraisal. The
opposition block was calling for greater representation in the Government and the
Speaker of the House declined to convene the Parliament. Six Cabinet Ministers resigned
in November 2006 (including the energy one) and the demonstrations by the opposition
in front of Government headquarters paralyzed parts of Beirut for months. Therefore, the
political climate early 2007 was challenging as the ambitious reform agenda was
envisaged by Paris III was being prepared. This led to a lack of consensus to move
forward the reform agenda, especially in the electricity sector.

9.      At the Paris III Conference held in January 2007, the international community
was presented with the Government of Lebanon’s (GoL) comprehensive and ambitious
reform program and asked to provide its financial support. The substantial aid pledged to
Lebanon (over US$ 7.6 billion) had a substantial emphasis on the power sector which
attested to its important contribution to the country’s sustainable reconstruction and
economic recovery program.

10.    A Country Assistance Strategy (CAS) for 2006-2009 was discussed by the Board
on December 2005, and was structured around the following pillars: (i) governance for
economic management and growth support; (ii) the development of human capital and
the mitigation of the poverty effects of transition; and (iii) resource and environmental



                                            16
management. During the preparation of this project, an Interim Strategy Note (ISN) was
being prepared to reflect on the significant changes in the underlying Lebanese context
This ISN was anchored in the Government’s medium-term reform program presented at
Paris III and around the same three pillars that characterized the previous CAS. The ISN
was endorsed by the Board before the effectiveness date of this project in July 2007.

11.     In parallel to the preparation of this project, a reform implementation
development policy loan (DPL) was under preparation, and this grant was seen as a first
step paving the way for the DPL’s ambitious objectives of reform. The DPL would in
turn help provide the policy environment under which substantial funds from other
donors would contribute to the significant investment and institutional needs in the
electricity sector. This DPL was eventually approved by the Board in August 2007.

1.2 Original Project Development Objectives (PDO) and Key Indicators

12.    The development objective of the project was to accelerate the implementation of
reforms and restructuring of EdL by enhancing the capacity of Ministry of Energy and
Water (MOEW), EdL and the multi-ministry higher level committee (MMHLC).

13.     As defined in the Grant Agreement, the MMHLC shall be composed of inter alia:
(i) the Prime Minister; (ii) the Minister for Finance; (iii) the Minister for Energy and
Water; (iv) the Secretary-General of the Higher Council for Privatization (HCP); (v) the
Director-General of EdL; and (vi) the President of the Council for Development and
Reconstruction (CDR). The MMHLC was to be responsible for overall project oversight
and coordination.

14.     The World Bank proposed to focus on three key project outcome indicators: (i)
the start of implementation of cost reduction projects; (ii) EdL restructuring and better
management, as well as a more skilled staff base resulting in efficiency and productivity
gains; and (iii) the injection of capacity in EdL so that cost reduction projects would be
implemented and reliability of supply improved.

1.3 Revised PDO (as approved by original approving authority) and Key Indicators,
and reasons/justification

15.     The PDO remained the same throughout the project lifespan. The original 3
project outcome indicators were replaced by 4 modified indicators after restructuring.
The rationale behind these modifications was to clarify and make more measurable the
original indicators, as well as to adapt the results framework to the changed
implementation plan proposed in the restructuring paper. Furthermore, some of the
intermediate outcome indicators changed during project restructuring.

1.4 Main Beneficiaries

16.    While the implementing agency or contracting authority was the CDR, the
beneficiaries of the grant were the MOEW, EdL and the HCP. Indirectly, all the



                                           17
   Lebanese population was to benefit from a reformed EdL which is more capable of
   achieving its mission.

   1.5 Original Components

17. The achievement of the project outcomes was to be supported through the following three
    components:
       (i) Provide support to strengthen the capacity of the MOEW to implement power
            sector policy reform
            The service contract under this component included policy advice on key sector
            strategic issues, on the completion of on-going projects, and on the establishment
            of a regulatory agency.
       (ii) Provide support to the Government of Lebanon for the restructuring of EdL
            The service contract envisaged under this component included advising the GoL
            on the restructuring strategy of EdL and the companies to be created, as well as
            developing an asset register and proposing a level of capitalization of the new
            companies.
       (iii)Provide support to EdL to improve the operational and financial performance and
            the implementation of its restructuring
            The service contract under this component was meant to address: generation
            efficiency and procurement, T&D reliability and efficiency, commercial issues,
            and financial issues and accounting.

   1.6 Revised Components

   18.     The project components remained the same throughout the project lifespan.

   1.7 Other significant changes

   19.     In June 2009, following a request from the GoL, the closing date of the project
   was extended by 6 months from June 30, 2009 to December 31, 2009. The rationale was
   that the two service contracts of components (i) and (iii) were signed in September 2007
   for a duration of 24 months, and more time was needed to ensure the adequate
   completion of these two contracts.

   20.      In December 2009, following another request from the GoL, the closing date was
   extended by another year until December 31, 2010. The goal of this extension was to
   allow the service contract of component (iii) to be finalized. This contract consisted of
   two phases. Only the reports for phase one had been delivered in August 2008 and were
   still awaiting GoL approval.

   21.     The project was restructured in December 2010. The goal of this restructuring
   was to reflect the fact that the original service contract of component (iii) was being
   terminated, and that the remaining US$ 1.8 million were being reallocated to: (i) support
   the development of a roadmap for corporatization; (ii) a study on the potential of
   liquefied natural gas for Lebanon; and (iii) hiring individual experts to support the



                                               18
   MOEW in implementing its Policy Paper for the Electricity Sector (PPES). In addition,
   this restructuring was used to clarify the original results framework. The closing date of
   the project was extended by 2 years to December 31, 2012 to allow for the adequate
   implementation of the above activities, and thus the achievement of the project’s
   development objective.

   2. Key Factors Affecting Implementation and Outcomes

   2.1 Project Preparation, Design and Quality at Entry

   22.      There was a clear rationale for the Bank’s intervention under this project and it
   was in line with the GoL’s priorities, both because of the heavy burden of the sector on
   the GoL’s budget, and because of the need to fund other post-war priority reconstruction
   efforts. This intervention was part of the wider Paris III roadmap agreed between the GoL
   and the donor community. In addition, the preparation of this operation was subject to the
   high time pressure characteristic of any emergency recovery grant intervention.

   23.     The difficulty of implementing sector reform projects in Lebanon based on
   previous experiences was duly acknowledged during project preparation. Broader lessons
   learned from Bank’s experience in implementing projects in post-conflict countries were
   collected. These included (i) having a flexible and very concrete project design to allow
   for adaptation to changing circumstances; (ii) unbundling carefully and limit as much as
   possible the number of unbundled entities; (iii) be ready to make adjustments midstream.

   24.    The project benefited from a co-financing of US$ 973,000 from the French
   Development Agency (AFD) for component (iii), which allowed for the service contract
   giving support to improve EdL’s financial and operational performance to cover a wider
   scope of activities.

25. Shortcomings at project appraisal included:
        The project design either overestimated the existing level of political consensus
           around the way EdL should be restructured, or assumed that the reform
           implementation DPL would achieve that consensus. Despite acknowledging that
           the fluid political environment was a risk, the project assumed that the consensus
           around the 2002 Electricity Law was wide, which was later on seen to be a miss-
           appreciation2.
        Assigning the supervision of the restructuring of EdL directly to the HCP.

   26.    The above-mentioned shortcomings are considered moderate and do not make the
   project objective or design inconsistent with the GoL and the Bank’s continuing
   development priorities in Lebanon.


   2
    The opposition block was calling for greater representation in the GoL and the Speaker of the House
   declined to convene the Parliament. Six Cabinet Ministers (including the Minister of Energy) resigned in
   November 2006 and the demonstrations by the opposition in front of the GoL headquarters paralyzed
   Beirut for months.


                                                     19
2.2 Implementation

27.     The political situation in Lebanon throughout project implementation was fragile.
Presidential elections that were due in the fall of 2007 were not held until May 2008. As a
result, a new interim government was formed, with its main mandate to prepare new
parliamentary elections in June 2009. Subsequently the new government that was formed
in November of that year remained in power until January 2011. Finally, a new
government took office in June 2011 and remained in place until the end of this project.

28.     The MMHLC was established to provide support to the energy reform process, to
which the Bank was contributing through this project and through the reform
implementation DPL. However, due mainly to lack of political agreement on
restructuring and corporatization of EdL, the MMHLC never reconvened after 2007,
which did not facilitate the much needed consensus building.

29.     The lack of consensus on EdL’s reform as defined in the electricity Law 462
across the GoL was evident when the consultant of component (ii) delivered its first
report in 2008, as the GoL was not able to approve the recommendations given by the
consultant, and was also unable to formulate a way forward based on consensus.
Eventually, the consultant’s contract was cancelled early 2011.

30.     The project’s restructuring in late 2010 helped achieve the PDO and contributed
to the full utilization of funds3. The restructuring was balanced as, while respecting the
original PDO, introduced pragmatic and achievable outcome indicators reflecting the
changes in activities, which facilitated getting the project back on track. A minor
shortcoming was that many of the intermediate indicators related to EdL’s
corporatization could have been dropped at the restructuring stage as it was clear at that
point that it would not happen over the lifespan of the project.

31.     Another factor that contributed to the overall success of the project was having
the Task Team Leader (TTL) based in Lebanon from 2010 onward. This contributed to
assist the GoL to take a decision on how to recommit the unused funds from the
component (ii) service contract, and to ensure the smooth implementation of these new
activities.

2.3 Monitoring and Evaluation (M&E) Design, Implementation and Utilization

32.     The PDO of the project was weakly defined, including an explanation of how the
objective was to be met by using the word “by? (as a synonym of “means of?). This
additive should not be part of an objective as it refers to the means by which the objective
is to be met. This matter is further complicated as this “by? statement was not fully
picked up as part of the outcome indicators, leaving considerable uncertainty about how
they are to be measured.

    The key elements of the restructuring are described in section 1.7 above.

33.     The outcome and intermediate indicators were overall clear, and their progress
was adequately reported in the implementation and status reports. However, many of the
original indicators were difficult to be measured. In addition, the number of intermediate
indicators was arguably more than what is needed for a technical assistance of this size
and characteristics, and the direct link with the components of this project was not always
solid.

2.4 Safeguard and Fiduciary Compliance

34.     The project complied with the Bank’s financial management (FM) procedures and
requirements. It submitted interim un-audited financial reports to the Bank on time. All
implementation and status reports (ISR) have consistently rated FM as satisfactory, audit
reports were submitted, with unqualified auditor’s opinion acceptable to the Bank. Two
key factors helped improve the project’s FM practices include: (i) the competency of the
finance unit at CDR; (ii) the introduction of e-disbursement in May 2010, which enabled
and speeded up the delivery of electronic withdrawal applications through Bank’s client
connection. In June 2010 the Bank conducted several workshops and training events on
the use of the e-disbursement facility in Beirut. The utilization of the new facility
improved processing of withdrawal applications, achieved faster turnaround time,
reduced transaction costs, and improved the Borrowers management of flow of funds.

35.    The procurement was adequately handled by CDR, who showed to have a solid
experience with WB procurement guidelines. In addition, the reactions of the market to
the expression of interest were satisfactory, ensuring a high likelihood of a good value for
money of the five studies financed by the project.

36.    As of December 31, 2012, the project had disbursed over 99.98% of the US$ 5
million grant proceeds.

37.     An assessment of safeguards compliance is not relevant for this project. This was
a category C project and no safeguard policies were triggered, given that the project was
a technical assistance.

2.5 Post-completion Operation/Next Phase

38.     This project will have a real impact if the recommendations developed under the
project to facilitate the reform process of EdL are used and the reform process is
sustained in the medium term. This is likely to be the case for a number of
recommendations that are part of the 2010 PPES currently under implementation. An
urgent follow-up step for EdL is for the Council of Ministers to approve the restructuring
road map under component (ii) and to provide the necessary budget to start its
implementation.

39.    A dialogue is underway on potential WB and other donors financing of some of
the reform program’ investments under the PPES. More specifically, discussions are
underway for the WB to give support to the GoL in the development of a liquefied



                                            21
   natural gas (LNG) re-gasification facility by potentially providing a partial risk guarantee
   (PRG). This initiative is a result of the Lebanese fuel source strategy presented in the
   PPES. Therefore, the origin of this activity can be partially attributed to the success of
   this project and its recommendations.

   3. Assessment of Outcomes
   3.1 Relevance of Objectives, Design and Implementation
   Rating: Substantial

   40.     The project objective’s relevance to the situation of Lebanon today is high.
   The Policy Statement and Budget Law of 2010 identified electricity as one of the priority
   focus area in which reform and investment actions would produce tangible results, and
   thus engagement in the sector is still highly relevant. In addition, Cabinet approved in
   June 2010 the PPES to reform the power sector in order to provide continuous and cost-
   effective electric power to all citizens and productive sectors. The Country Partnership
   Strategy (2011-2014) for Lebanon includes electricity as an explicit priority in one of its
   four strategic goals (economic infrastructure). In addition, two other of these goals are
   related to consequences of the dysfunctional electricity sector, the difficulties to achieve
   fiscal sustainability, as well as the challenges to have a competitive business environment
   having such a deficient public power system.

   41.     The design and implementation of the project have shown to be substantially
   relevant. The three components were an adequate comprehensive support to the MOEW
   in the implementation of necessary sector reforms, a technical assistance on how to
   restructure EdL, and a support to EdL to improve its operational and operational
   performance. A moderate shortcoming was that the MMHLC did not supervise the
   implementation of the second component as designed (restructuring of EdL). This was
   due to the fact that, since the MMHLC never reconvened after 2007, the consultancy
   study of component (ii) on the restructuring of EdL was exclusively led by the HCP. In
   addition, at a later stage, a second study on the same topic was lead exclusively by the
   MOEW. The main difference between these two studies is that while the former proposed
   to quickly transit into unbundling of EdL, the latter recommended having a smoother
   transition towards corporatization.

   42.    Based on a highly relevant objective, and substantially relevant design and
   implementation, the relevance of the objective, design and implementation of the
   project is rated as substantial.

   3.2 Achievement of Project Development Objectives
   Rating: Moderately Satisfactory

43. As a technical assistance, this project delivered 5 studies which contributed to achieve the
    projects’ outcome as well as the PDO indicators. The 5 studies and the project
    components’ outputs are summarized here and further described in Annex 2:




                                                22
   Component 1:
       a. “Strengthening the capacity of the MOEW to implement power sector policy
          reforms (from November 2007 to September 2009)
       b. “The LNG solution for Lebanon? (from October 2011 to April 2012)
   Component 2:
       c. “Advisory support to restructure and corporatize EdL? (started in November
          2007 and terminated early 2011).
       d. “Assistance for the corporatization of EdL? (from February to June 2012)
   Component 3:
       e. “Financial and Engineering Support Services to EdL? (September 2007 to
          April 2009)

   44.     This ICR does not evaluate separately the achievements before and after the 2010
   restructuring because the PDO remained unchanged. While some of the outcome
   indicators changed, this ICR understand this was done with the purpose of clarifying the
   indicators and making them and more measurable. The table below shows that at the time
   of restructuring, the original three outcome indicators had not been achieved. After
   restructuring, however, the performance improved, and three indicators were fully
   achieved and one partially achieved.

                                  Achievement of outcome indicators
                           Outcome indicators                                       Project        Achievement
                                                                                  component
Pre-restructuring
1. Cost reduction projects start being implemented.                                     1               No*

3. Capacity is injected in EdL so that cost reduction projects get                      3               No*

Government of Lebanon's Policy Paper for the Electricity Sector (PPES).
6. Planning finalized for EdL to be restructured                                        2               Yes
7. Roadmap for EdL restructuring/corporatization finalized and agreed                   2             Partially
across Government.
        * These indicators are evaluated at the time they were revised or dropped (that is December 2010)

45. For evaluation purposes, the PDO of this project is disaggregated in the following two
    parts:
        (i)   Accelerate the implementation of reforms (project component 1)
        (ii)  Accelerate the restructuring of EdL (project components 2 and 3)

46. The first part of the PDO has been satisfactorily achieved because of the following:
        A key success of this project has been to provide comprehensive inputs into the
            2010 PPES prepared by the MOEW and approved by the Council of Ministers.
            Indeed many of the ten strategic initiatives put forward in the PPES directly


                                                       23
           emanate from the reports produced under the consultancy service contract of
           assisting the MOEW of component (1), including, for example, the increase in
           generation and transmission capacity addressed in law 181/2011 (approved in
           October 2011).
          Broad and significant progress has taken place on the implementation of the 2010
           PPES, including: (i) re-gasification plant to import LNG under tendering process;
           (ii) distribution service providers’ contracts ongoing; (iii) improvement plan for
           Deir Ammar and Zahrani under implementation; (iv) improvement rehabilitation
           plans for Zouk and Jieh under tendering process.
          As stated in the PPES of 2010, a prefeasibility study to construct a LNG marine
           terminal has been completed. The tender for the project has started by issuing the
           request for expressions of interest in March 2012, and the request for proposals is
           scheduled to be issued early summer 2013. Since the cost of fuel represents at
           least two-thirds of the total electricity cost, switching to gas will bring clear cost
           reductions.

47. Project achievements corresponding to the second part of the PDO include:
        Following the 2010 PPES, the management of the distribution business of EdL
            has been turned-over to three distribution service providers under management
            contracts.
        Some progress has been made in terms of EdL management procedures, such as
            updated financial audits reporting, financial forecasting, or generation of key
            performance indicators.
        A roadmap for EdL restructuring has been finalized (see second study of
            component 2).

48. Some shortcomings in the achievement of the second part of the PDO include:
        The EdL roadmap restructuring has not been approved yet by the Council of
          Ministers - it is currently with the MOEW who needs to seek approval.
        Despite restructuring having initiated, it is still not clear if and when EdL would
          be corporatized.

   49.     Based on the satisfactory achievement of one part of the PDO and moderately
   satisfactory achievement of the other part, the overall achievement of the project
   objective is rated as moderately satisfactory.

   3.3 Efficiency
   Rating: Moderately Satisfactory

   50.    No explicit economic or financial analysis was conducted during project
   preparation, which is understandable given the technical assistance nature of the project.
   Instead, some of the potential economic and fiscal impacts that could emanate from this
   technical assistance were enumerated. The economic impacts identified at appraisal
   included: reduction of sector investment needs and the long-term cost, lower
   consumption of production factors, reduction of the utilization of non-economical
   individual power generators, reduction of economic production lost, and reduction of


                                                24
    power thefts. The fiscal benefits of the reforms were to be measured in terms of reduced
    need for Government subsidies.

    51.    Some of the economic impacts identified at appraisal have been or are in the
    process of being harnessed. These include, for example: lower generation costs with LNG
    estimated at US$ 200 million per year savings, benefits from the rehabilitation of Zouk
    and Jieh estimated at US$ 30 million per year savings, or likely reduction of losses
    through the DSPs contracts implementations.

    52.     However, as can be seen in the graph below, the fiscal burden of EdL on the GoL
    budget has not diminished since 2007. Following very closely the price of crude oil, it
    has gone from representing 3.9% of Lebanon GDP in 2007 (US$ 1 billion) to 5.4%
    (expected) in 2012 (more than US$ 2 billion).While this result is not satisfactory, it may
    have been unrealistic to establish clear causality links between this technical assistance
    project and a reduction in the fiscal burden of EdL for the GoL.

    53.     Since this project was a technical assistance, another way to assess its efficiency
    is to look at the quality of the procurement process of its five service contracts. The table
    below summarizes the available data on these procurement processes:

                              1st EdL          Support to      Support to         2nd EdL        LNG study

                                                     25
54.     The above procurements were competitive for the following reasons: (i) the
number of expressions of interest (EoI) were between middle-high and high, (ii) there
were international firms interested in the contracts (which means that the advertisement
was well done, and that there was an interest in that type of contract), (iii) in most cases
the 1st technical option selected was the final option (which is positive from the GoL’s
perspective), and (iv) many firms from the shortlist passed the technical minimum (which
is a signal of quality as, according to WB procurement rules, a maximum of 2 firms from
the same country can be put in a shortlists).

55.     A moderate shortcoming is that it would have been more efficient to have only
one service contract looking at the restructuring possibilities of EdL. Some inefficiency
arose from obvious thematic overlapping. However, the two studies approached the
restructuring challenge form different perspectives, and were supervised differently, and
recommended different speeds of transition towards EdL corporatization.

56.     Given that important economic benefits of the project are very likely to be
realized, that the procurement of all studies of this technical assistance project were
efficient, but that two studies partially overlapped thematically, the efficiency of the
project is rated as moderately satisfactory.

3.4 Justification of Overall Outcome Rating

57.    The project is overall rated moderately satisfactory as a result of combining
the ratings of its relevance, achievements, and efficiency, which are rated either
substantial or moderately satisfactory.

3.5 Overarching Themes, Other Outcomes and Impacts

(a) Poverty Impacts, Gender Aspects, and Social Development

58.     Despite the evident impacts that a better functioning electricity sector would have
on social development and poverty reduction, there are no specific impacts for this
section that have not already been mentioned in other parts of the document. With respect
to gender issues, they were neither assessed at project appraisal nor in the ICR because
the design of the project is considered to be gender-neutral.

(b) Institutional Change/Strengthening

59.      Some of the consultants hired by the MOEW following discussions under this
project have brought much needed specific technical expertise and have remained in the
MOEW even after this project’s closure. These consultants are for example currently
working on an update to the 2010 PPES and the derived benefits with the latest
information about the projects that have been implemented or under implementation. This
new study will have a base year 2012 and it will forecast a short term study up to 2015
and a long term study up to 2025. Hence the impact on long-term capacity and
institutional development of the MOEW has been significant.



                                            26
(c) Other Unintended Outcomes and Impacts

60.    The analytical evidence and modeling that has allowed quantifying some of the
simulated benefits of the 2010 PPES has been particularly rigorous. As a result, some of
the MOEW consultants have published an article in a renowned academic peer-reviewed
journal (Energy Policy) called “A simulation model for reliability-based appraisal of an
energy policy: the case of Lebanon?.

4. Assessment of Risk to Development Outcome
Rating: Significant

61.    While the likelihood that the capital investments outlined in the PPES does not
materialize is moderate, the likelihood that some of the necessary reforms do not take
place is significant (e.g. tariff restructuring). This could have a significant negative
impact on the sector, as it would strongly undermine the sustainability of the planned
investments as well as of the overall sector. In addition, while the continuing
implementation of the DSP contracts is not in danger, the follow-up once the two years
implementation period is over is an area of risk as well.

62.     The likelihood that the proposed roadmap for restructuring of EdL is not endorsed
anytime soon by the Council of Ministers is significant. While the MOEW technical staff
has been involved in the process, it could be the case that a political consensus is hard to
reach. In addition, sectarian interests and political instability could also be a challenge to
this endorsement and to the implementation of EdL’s restructuring4. The impact of not
reaching a political consensus would be again significant, as the momentum and tools
provided by this project for EdL’s restructuring would be lost and become quickly
outdated.

63.     Given the inherently political nature of the above and the difficulty to have clear
mitigation measures against them, the risk to development outcome is deemed to be
significant.

5. Assessment of Bank and Borrower Performance
5.1 Bank Performance

(a) Bank Performance in Ensuring Quality at Entry
Rating: Moderately Satisfactory

64.     The Bank’s performance during project preparation was overall satisfactory: the
rationale for the project was clear, its goals were in line with the GoL’s priorities defined
in the framework of the Paris III conference, there was a commitment from the different
branches of the GoL to the PDO, and this technical assistance was aimed at laying the
ground for the reform DPL approved a few months later in 2007.

65.     The Bank decided to take a calculated risk believing there was a window of
opportunity for reform. Despite the fact that defining project outcomes of technical
assistances is challenging, the PDO of the project was potentially too wide and
overestimated the real level of political consensus around how to restructure EdL – or
assumed that the parallel reform implementation DPL would achieve that consensus.

66.      In addition, a deep analysis of the political economy around the power sector in
Lebanon would have helped to understand and ensure the buy-in of the reform by a
critical mass of key stakeholders. Part of these shortcomings was presumably due to tight
time constraints given that this was an emergency grant.

67.   Since the above shortcomings are considered to be moderate, the WB
performance during identification, preparation and appraisal of the project is rated
moderately satisfactory.

(b) Quality of Supervision
Rating: Satisfactory

68.     The WB team performed well during project supervision: (i) the team’s
composition during missions was balanced; (ii) reporting by Aide Memoires and
Implementation Status Report was done regularly; (iii) the team reacted timely when the
approval of the first EdL restructuring contract’ report was delayed and pushed for
alternative solutions to accelerate the lagging disbursements, managing to put the project
back on track; (iv) the restructuring of the project successfully managed to inverse the
previous negative performance tendency; (v) a fluid dialogue with the GoL accompanied
the full lifespan of the project, particularly in supporting the implementation of the PPES
after the restructuring; and (vi) the TTL of the project was based in Beirut since 2010.

69.     Some shortcomings included: (i) the results framework’ intermediate indicators
were not consistently tracked before the 2010 restructuring; (ii) the number of
intermediate indicators could have been reduced during the project restructuring. Since
these shortcomings are considered as minor, the Bank’s supervision quality is rated as
satisfactory.

(c) Justification of Rating for Overall Bank Performance
Rating: Moderately Satisfactory

70.     The ICR rates the overall performance of the WB as moderately satisfactory.
In line with the harmonized criteria for ICR and IEG evaluations, the rating of overall
WB performance is based on the ratings for each of the two dimensions which are one
rated moderately satisfactory (WB performance in ensuring quality at entry) and the other
one satisfactory (WB quality of supervision).

5.2 Borrower Performance

This ICR considers the CDR to be the implementing agency, and the MOEW, HCP, and
EdL are all considered as parts of the Government5.

(a) Government Performance
Rating: Moderately Satisfactory

71.     The GoL showed its commitment to improve the sector in 2010 with the PPES
approval by the Council of Ministers, building significantly on the outputs generated by
the service contract supporting the MOEW. In addition, the GoL has started
implementing several of the activities included in the PPES. The supervision by the
different parts of the GoL of the five service contracts was generally satisfactory.

72.     However, the following moderate shortcomings were noticed: (i) it took the GoL
two years and a half to terminate the first EdL restructuring contract since the report was
presented in 2008, due to divergences of views on the speed at which reform of EdL
should take place. However, this delay was partly due to a change in Minister6, with the
new Minister taking the necessary time required to understand the sector and develop a
Policy Paper to address sector issues, before then requesting a restructuring to improve
the Project's performance in line with the policies that had been decided upon; (ii) the
level of consultations and inclusiveness of the part of the GoL leading both EdL
restructuring studies were suboptimal, complicating a consensus around the final outputs
of consultants; (iii) EdL’s approval and feedback to its consultant’s reports was
considerably slower than what is best practice, creating delays in payments that produced
understandable tensions from the consultant.

73.   Given the above mentioned moderate shortcomings, the Government’s
performance is rated moderately satisfactory.

(b) Implementing Agency Performance
Rating: Satisfactory




5
    This is in accordance with Article II of the Trust Fund for Lebanon Grant Agreement.
6
    The MOEW was under the leadership of the same Minister under the last two GoL administrations.


                                                    29
74.     The management of CDR worked diligently to ensure that implementation
proceeded on schedule given the work environment, fulfilling its fiduciary functions
specified in the Grant Agreement. In addition, when different branches of the GoL had
diverging opinions, it somehow managed to play a catalyzing role in inducing consensus
and in unblocking overdue payments to consultants.

75.   Since the shortcomings of the CDR performance were only minor, the
implementing agency performance is rated satisfactory.

(c) Justification of Rating for Overall Borrower Performance
Rating: Moderately Satisfactory

76.     The ICR rates the overall performance of the Borrower as moderately
satisfactory. In line with the harmonized criteria for ICR and IEG evaluations, and
considering that one dimension is in the unsatisfactory range while the rating for the other
dimension is in the satisfactory range, the rating of the overall borrower performance
depends on the outcome rating. The moderately satisfactory rating is given because the
outcome is in the satisfactory range.

6. Lessons Learned
77.     The Bank’s entering strategy into sensitive political topics in complex
environments should be carefully scrutinized. While risk taking during project
preparation should be encouraged when a window of opportunity is identified, pragmatic
and focused project development objectives consistent with the amount of resources
involved facilitate achieving a higher impact of the project. For example, while having a
real impact in accelerating the reform of EdL with a small financial envelope such as this
grant may have been overambitious, contributing to switching the Lebanese power plants
into gas is a less controversial objective with a huge rate of return for the sector.

78.     Being transparent and earning buy-in from stakeholders on the reform
process is essential: if the final industrial structure is not defined ex ante, the
restructuring assessment should be inclusive of all stakeholders to succeed. Given the
fact that the MMHLC never formally convened after 2007, the first EdL restructuring
study was led almost exclusively by the HCP, and the second EdL restructuring study
was led almost exclusively by the MOEW, with very little buy-in from other important
agencies and players. Both studies have in common the long-term objective, but the short
and medium term recommendations differ on the speed at which the sector should be
reformed.

79.    If one aims at important power sector reforms, having a clear and explicit
understanding of the political economy challenges is essential to understand who the
winners and losers behind the reform are. This is of paramount importance to create pro-
reform coalitions that can help foster the process and avoid narrow sectarian interests
continuing overshadowing national level interests.

7. Comments on Issues Raised by Borrower/Implementing Agencies
80.    Comments were received from the HCP and are gratefully acknowledged by the
Bank team. In addition to pointing out a number of minor details and inconsistencies in
the document that have been addressed, the comments from the HCP build on the
following two issues.

81.     First, the HCP argues that this report indicates that neither the first nor the second
EdL restructuring contracts were able to achieve consensus among the Lebanese
government stakeholders and that a more inclusive approach could have been used to
handle both contracts. The HCP disagrees that this was the case for the first of those
contracts. While the Bank team acknowledges HCP's efforts to build consensus, and that
a certain amount of consensus was reached, the Bank team believes that the fact that the
first important output of this first EdL restructuring contract was never approved by all
parties shows that there was some level of disagreement on certain aspects. Eventually,
this lead to the termination of this contract.

82.     Second, the HCP clarifies that it is a ministerial committee headed by the Prime
Minister, which members are the Minister of Finance, the Minister of Economy and
Trade, the Minister of Labor, the Minister of Justice and the relevant Minister, in this
case the Minister of Energy and Water. The Bank team takes note of this information,
which does not contradict the fact that the grant agreement of this project required the
creation of a multi-ministry higher level committee that never met after 2007. This
committee was to be composed of inter alia the Prime Minister, the Minister for Finance,
the Minister for Energy and Water, the Secretary General of the Higher Council for
Privatization, the Director General of EdL, and the President of the Council for
Development and Reconstruction.

Annex 2. Outputs by Component
This Annex presents the main sections and main outputs and recommendations of the five
service contracts that have constituted the bulk of the expenses under this contract.

Component 1: Provide support to strengthen the capacity of the Ministry of Energy
and Water (MOEW) to implement power sector policy reform

The services covered under this component included policy advice on key sector strategic
issues, complete on-going projects, and the establishment of a regulatory agency. The
following two studies fall under this component.

   i)     The Strengthening the Capacity of the Ministry of Energy and Water to
          implement power sector policy reforms (November 2007 to September 2009)

In addition to an Inception and a Final report, the following ten sector reports were
produced under this study:
   1) Power sector strategy
   2) Fuel sourcing strategy
   3) Advice on implementation of fuel strategy
   4) Natural gas
   5) Liquefied Natural Gas
   6) Donor coordination
   7) CRA projects intended to minimize non-technical losses in distribution
   8) IPPs
   9) Proposal for establishment of the regulator
   10) Tools and procedures to be used by the regulator

The following recommendations of further actions were given:
    Initiate investigations for possible sites for 300 MW reciprocating engines and
       start its procurement
    Launch site investigation and detailed studies for a coal fired power plant in
       Salaata
    Launch necessary regulatory measures for LNG development, and initiate tender
       documents for a FSRU
    Increase tariffs by 20% for 2010
    Develop a step-by-step plan for increasing the effectiveness of the transmission
       system and system operation
    Initiate immediate activities to reduce non-technical losses
    Initiate immediate formation of the Electricity Regulatory Agency
    Resume the Mercados study and choose urgently the final future management
       model for the Lebanese electricity sector so that restructuring can be assumed as
       soon as possible so as to support all the other measures stated above.




                                          33
   ii)     The LNG solution for Lebanon (February to June 2012)

The Government of Lebanon had already expressed in its 2010 PPES its willingness to
purchase Liquefied Natural Gas (LNG) to reduce the large cost burden of burning gasoil
in its power plants. For this purpose, a LNG import terminal is being envisaged, and this
study was aimed at providing advice to the GoL on how to implement it.

The objectives of the study were:
    to confirm that a long-term supply contract for the volumes required in Lebanon
       was possible and an indication of the expected price range based on in-depth
       investigation of the global LNG market and key suppliers;
    for 3 envisaged sites for the import terminal: provide the optimal design
       (receiving terminal, storage, regasification, and associated facilities), describe the
       environmental and social impacts, estimate the costs and lead times, develop
       analyses of project economics;
    give advice on legal and regulatory issues and requirements, as well as on feasible
       project structures and associated project financing options;
    recommend a site, a project structure, and a LNG purchasing option;
    confirm that LNG terminal developers and LNG suppliers are interested to
       participate in the proposed project to deliver regasified natural gas to the GoL and
       under which conditions.

The key findings of the study were:
    Lebanon will require up to 3.5 MMt per year of LNG demand to meet long-term
       power generation requirements;
    An offshore floating storage and regasification unit (FSRU) is the preferred
       technology for Lebanon LNG imports;
    Beddawi is the preferred site because of its closeness to existing CCGT plants and
       relatively sheletered offshore site;
    Some of the key suppliers that the GoL should approach for procuring LNG are
       Qatar, Algeria, Egypt, and Yemen. In addition, companies controlling LNG
       supply from the region are: Qatar Petroleum, Sonatrach (Algeria), GDF Suez
       (Egypt and Yemen), Total (Yemen and Qatar), and Shell (Qatar).
    Lebanon will be competing with European and Asian buyers for LNG. It would
       therefore pay a price between 11 and 14 $/MMBtu to secure LNG at projected oil
       prices of $ 90 per BBL (or between 13 and 16 at current $ 120 per BBL), which
       remains at a large discount to premium gasoil currently used in CCGTs.
    Efficient decision making by the GoL is crucial to advance the project and secure
       both the LNG supply and the FSRU vessel. This includes having in place all the
       required regulatory natural gas and LNG import requirements (2002 LNG and
       natural gas draft law could be a good platform to initiate the process).




                                             34
Component 2: Provide support to the Government of Lebanon for the restructuring
of EdL

The key services envisaged under this component included advising the GoL on the
restructuring strategy of EdL and the companies to be created, as well as developing an
asset register and proposing a level of capitalization of the new companies.

   iii)    Advisory support to restructure and corporatize Electricité du Liban (started
           in November 2007 and was terminated early 2011)

This project aimed at having the consultant make proposal in the two following areas:
   1) Industry structure: how many companies, ownership, management and other
       key ‘macro-organizational’ issues.
   2) Industry model and instruments: how would the unbundled sector function,
       where would markets be introduced, which segments would be regulated, and
       additional ‘process-related’ issues designed to improve the overall sector
       efficiency.

The report on the first component was delivered to the client in August 2008. However,
its conclusions did not generate consensus among different parts of the GoL, and the go
ahead for the second part of the work was never given to the consultant. Eventually, the
contract was cancelled early 2011 and the remaining funds were reallocated to other tasks
(i.e. the Booz Allen contract, the Poten & Partners contract, and hiring of some
consultants for the MOEW).

The first report included a map of sector participants in the Lebanese electricity sector,
the rights and obligations of each of the participants, the roles of the GoL and different
governmental offices, and a proposed electricity sector / market model structure for
Lebanon, including the roles for the public and private sector. Considering that the two
main objectives of restructuring EdL were to attract private investment in generation and
to improve the operational performance of the whole system, the recommendations made
by Mercados in this report were the following:
     Establish a competition for the market between potential entrants (IPPs) as an
        interim arrangement in the long term reform process which should aim at
        competition in the market between generators (i.e. wholesale market competition)
     Establish a classical Power Purchasing Entity (PPE) independent from EdL
        generation (which could imply amend law 462 to allow for PPE independency)
     Keep the Transmission service provider (TSP) and System Operator (SO) unified
        under EdL Transco
     Unbundle EdL generation system into 3 business units (the two similar thermal
        plants of Deir Amar and Zahrani, and the remaining portfolio in another business
        unit)
     Unbundle the distribution into 2 companies (Disco North and Disco South)
     Once EdL is corporatized, ensure it does have a holding structure, with legal
        separation between the different subsidiaries


                                           35
The institutional organization proposed is represented in the following diagram:




The industry structure proposed is represented in the following diagram:




   iv)     Assistance for the corporatization of Electricite du Liban (from February to
           June 2012)

The CDR commissioned Booz & Co to develop the required studies for the assessment an
planning phase of the corporatization of EdL, which should eventually be followed by the
implementation phase. A three-tier approach was chosen.

   1) Target industry structure
Based on lessons learned from other cases and considering Lebanon’s context, five target
industry structure options were considered: (i) total vertical integration, (ii) generation
(G) and transmission (T) integrated, and several distribution (D) companies created; (iii)
T and D integrated, and several G companies created; (iv) G and D integrated and
separate T company created; (v) full unbundling.

All of these options were analyzed based on five criteria: benefits for consumers, benefits
for the GoL, support for liberalization, ease of implementation, and legal/regulatory


                                            36
simplicity. A fully unbundled model as a 10 year target industry structure was
recommended, as it maximizes the benefits for consumers and the GoL, and opens the
way to more advanced liberalization and competition.

    2) Preferred 1 to 5 years implementation approach
Two alternative implementation approaches were considered: a one-step approach with
the legal unbundling since the beginning, and a two-step approach with functional
unbundling as a first step. The latter was considered to be more advantageous. In step 1,
the current EdL would be corporatized into one joint stock company fully owned by the
GoL, and would be enabled to create other companies. This company would be
restructured, functionally unbundled and commercialized in 1 to 5 years. Afterwards, in
step 2 and once the target industry structure is finalized, the new EdL company would be
legally unbundled by creating other companies in line with the target industry structure.

The two-step approach was chosen given the following advantages: (i) easier to
implement in the short term and less disruptive for the organization; (ii) lower risks of
failure as it is a more cautious and tested approach; (iii) allows to improve sector
performance before legal unbundling, thus maximizing the likelihood of achieving value
creation (given the current dysfunctional situation of the Lebanese power sector); and (iv)
it enables more informed decision on the appropriate sector structure and private sector
participation.

   3) Implementation enablers and requirements
The following 5 key dimensions were studied as part of the action plan for
corporatization and restructuring of EdL:
           a. operating model
           b. organization and capabilities
           c. governance framework
           d. financial plan
           e. legal requirements

Component 3: Provide support to EdL to improve the operational and financial
performance and the implementation of its restructuring

The services under this component were meant to address: generation efficiency and
procurement, transmission and distribution (T&D) reliability and efficiency and
commercial issues, financial issues and accounting, and the restructuring of EdL.

   v)      Financial and engineering support to Electricite du Liban (September 2007
           to April 2009)

The overall project had two primary objectives:
   1) Assist EdL to improve its performance during the interim period between the
      beginning of the assignment and the moment the restructuring was implemented.
      This assistance was to focus on technical, procurement, commercial and financial
      aspects of the business.



                                            37
   2) Assist in the restructuring activities of EdL by:
       Participating in the review of reports prepared by corporate restructuring and
         electricity trading arrangements consultants
       Participating in the corporate restructuring
       Ensuring the availability of reliable information to the corporate restructuring
         consultants as well as to the privatization transaction advisors for the
         downstream privatization of a restructured EdL

The project work included the following 8 tasks or chapters: base year data, generation,
safety, procurement, transmission & distribution, commercial, finance, and restructuring
coordination & support. Based on this structure, the following 27 outputs were produced:

      Base year data report

      Mapping system for the medium voltage network
      Priority equipment and materials needs
      Calculation of non-technical losses
      Strategy to reduce non-technical losses
      Strategy to increase collection rate

Annex 3. Summary of the Government of Lebanon 2010 Policy Paper
for the Electricity Sector
This Policy Paper for the Electricity Sector was approved by the Lebanese Council of
Ministers in June 2010 and constitutes a global framework for the electric energy sector
in Lebanon. It includes ten strategic initiatives that are integrated and correlated to cover
three chapters:
     Sector’s infrastructure (1. Generation; 2. Transmission; 3. Distribution);
     Supply/Demand (4. Fuel Sourcing; 5. Renewable energy; 6. Demand side
        management / energy efficiency; 7. Tariffs)
     Legal aspects (8. Norms and standards; 9. Corporatization of EdL; 10. Legal
        status)

The initiatives are developed into identified plans of action with required budget,
financing schemes, and timeframe. The elimination/delay of any initiative and action will
lead to losing the policy objective of rescuing the power sector from the current drastic
situation to a new sustainable, reliable, and efficient delivery of electricity. A transitional
rescue period of 3 - 4 years is required to achieve the goals of this policy.

This paper remedies most of the problems of the electric energy sector starting by the
addition of generating capacity to cover the existing gap, demand forecast and required
reserve together with the necessary infrastructure to transmit and distribute the generated
energy to consumers throughout the Lebanese service territory in a secure and
economical manner. The transmission and distribution infrastructures will be upgraded to
cope with the capacity additions and to improve the operability of the system, thus
decreasing the technical losses. The policy calls for the establishment of a smart grid
using meters with remote disconnects from control centers that will be operated with
specialized service providers for the transitional period to modulate consumption and
reduce non-technical losses.

On the supply side, the capacity addition shall include conventional energy sources that
are the most economical with the least environmental impact mainly the natural gas; and
renewable energies such as wind, solar, waste to energy, etc. The infrastructure
requirements for the natural gas (LNG terminal, pipeline along the coast, etc.) are
included in the policy. On the demand side, the policy aims to develop several demand
side management and energy efficiency initiatives (e.g., CFL, SWH, etc.) to curb the load
growth and improve the load factor which translates into guaranteed savings for the
economy. To help increase the penetration of energy efficient devices, the policy calls for
the adoption of standards and labels to promote them. Furthermore, a restructuring of the
tariff, leading to a gradual balance in the fiscal budget of EDL, is necessary to both
generate needed revenues on the treasury side and to unload the financial burden on the
economy and the consumer side by eliminating the need for private generators and
providing reliable 24/24 hour service.

The multitude of the projects included in this policy will require a proper legal
framework for a transition phase until a permanent and stable situation for the sector is


                                              39
established. Similarly, the necessary financial, administrative and human resources will
be given to EdL to manage the transition phase until the corporatization of EDL is
accomplished. All this will be done in collaboration and partnership with the private
sector and the donor community to benefit from their vast experiences and resources.

The policy will result in a solid power sector with more than 4000 MW generation
capacity in 2014 and 5000 MW after 2015, reliable transmission and distribution
networks, and efficient delivery of electricity to cope with the overall socio-economic
development of Lebanon. The policy targets a gradual implementation of the initiatives in
the short and medium terms totaling 4870 M$ for 4000 MW (Government in Lebanon up
to 1550 M$, the private sector contribution of 2320 M$, and the international donor
community up to 1000 M$), and an additional amount of 1650 M$ in the long term. The
full implementation of all the strategic initiatives in this policy will reduce the total losses
from 4.4 Billion $ in 2010 to zero in 2014 where 24/24 hours of service is provided, and
the possibility of profit making as of 2015; while it will reach 9.5 Billion $ in 2015 if no
action is taken.

This ambitious but realistic policy was prepared after a review of all previous studies, and
in collaboration of all concerned parties, whether internal or external, constitutional and
political, and aims to be approved consensually by the Council Of Ministers.

Annex 5. Summary of Borrower's ICR
The Completion Report of the Borrower was prepared by the Council for Development
and Reconstruction and structured with the following four parts:

      Background
      Allocations of the grant
      Recommendations of the studies and their contribution to reform actions
      Conclusions

The section that describes the allocation of the grant provides detailed information on the
amounts of the original contracts (with its corresponding taxes and VAT), and the
amounts eventually used under each contract. It also provides information on the basic
deliverables that were expected under each contract. Of the three original contracts, 1.7%
of the MOEW support contract, 18.8% of the EdL support contract, and 50% of the first
EdL restructuring contract were cancelled. This generated savings of US$ 1.4 million of
the World Bank resources, which were used to contract two activities for the LNG
contract as well as the second EdL restructuring contract.

Many of the recommendations of the MOEW support contract have been adopted by the
GoL. The increase of generation capacity through reciprocating engines and
reinforcement of the transmissions system were both addressed in law 181 in 2011. The
tender documents for the Floating Station Regasification Unit (FSRU) have just been
finalized in early 2013. Finally, the regulatory and market structure challenges were
addressed in the second EdL restructuring contract.

The EdL support study provided recommendations and equipped EdL with tools and
training on the following areas: generation, safety, procurement, transmission and
distribution, commercial, finance, restructuring coordination and support, and key
performance indicators. While the bidding and contracting phases of this contract went
well, the execution phase was confronted with some difficulties embodied in the intricate
engagements of EdL management, where multiple approvals from various management
directors and managers were needed. If the tasks of the consultancy services for a
contract signed in favor of EdL had been subdivided into smaller tasks, it would have
most likely prevented the formation of managerial committees that required multiple
approvals – and hence would have avoided the partial approvals and the tardiness. There
seems to be a good lesson that can be learned from this experience.

The first EdL restructuring study proposed having a power purchasing entity independent
from EdL generation under the classical model, without a legal monopoly for purchasing
and selling energy, to conduct competition for the market. Also, it suggested that once
EdL would be corporatized, it would have a holding structure, with legal separation
between the different subsidiaries. A continuation was the second EdL restructuring study,
which proposed a corporatization plan based on the design and implementation of 12
initiatives, which were estimated to have a cost of US$ 30 million. Both the first and
second EdL restructuring studies maintained a good path during procurement and


                                            42
contracting. However, their execution was intercepted with difficulties related to legal
issues: namely, law 246 and the designation of the regulatory authority for the sector. A
difference in point of views between the MoEW and the Secretariat of the HCP surfaced.
The difference was connected with the issue of either adopting an interim period or
directly transiting into corporatization. The recommendations of both studies have not
been transformed into action up until now and are pending political decisions by the HCP.

The LNG supply study stated that Lebanon will require up to 3. 5 MMt per year of LNG
Demand to meet long term generation requirements, and proposed to construct an
offshore FSRU. It provided a comprehensive analysis of the LNG market and the
opportunities and challenges for Lebanon in entering this market. A second phase of this
study was contracted with the same company in October 2012 with funding from the GoL
to prepare the bid package for the proposed public private partnership, provide the
technical support to review the proposals, help negotiate support for the PPP, gas sales,
and purchase agreement, as well as to provide in house training. The launching of the
tendering process was announced on April 10, 2013.
