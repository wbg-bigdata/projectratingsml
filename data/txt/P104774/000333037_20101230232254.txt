SUMMARY
The objective of the project is to accelerate the implementation of electricity sector
reforms and restructuring of EdL by enhancing the capacity of MOEW, EdL and the
multi-ministry higher level committee.

To date the Project has funded three consulting contracts that have supported the
Lebanese government with the capacity to implement reforms to the electricity sector.
However, one of these consulting contracts has not been completed due to lack of
political consensus around recommendations made by the consultants. The Government
of Lebanon therefore intends to terminate this contract and using remaining project funds
to fund further consulting services to support implementation of much needed electricity
sector reforms.

This restructuring paper proposes a second extension to the closing date of this project
from December 31, 2010 to December 31, 2012 to allow the project to be completed and
to meet its original Project Development Objectives (PDOs).

As a result of the changed implementation plan for the project, the results framework,
disbursement and procurement plans for the project have also been updated. These are
included as annexes to this restructuring paper.



PROJECT STATUS
The project has funded three consulting assignments in support of reform of the Lebanese
electricity sector through a $5M Grant. These included a contract with Decon to support
strategy and planning within the Ministry of Energy and Water; a contract with Azorom
to support the improved performance of Electricite du Leban (EdL); and a contract with
Mercados to support corporatization of EdL. The first two of these consulting
assignments have been completed satisfactorily, and have in part contributed to the
development of a Policy Paper for Lebanon's Electricity Sector that was endorsed by the
Lebanese Council of Ministers in June 2010. However, the third contract with Mercados,
to support the corporatization of EdL, had effectively stalled due to lack of political
consensus around the form of corporatization that Mercados had recommended.

In August, 2010 the Bank wrote to the Government of Lebanon urging it to take action
with respect to its contract with Mercados and thereby improve the performance of the
project. At this stage, as reflected in the most recent ISR for this project, the Bank
                                           3
downgraded the project's performance in meeting its project development objectives
(PDOs) from Marginally Unsatisfactory to Unsatisfactory. In October, 2010 the Bank
again wrote to the Government of Lebanon, outlining the actions the Government would
need to take if the project was to be extended and remaining funds utilized.

The Government has now responded to the Bank's request, and is taking steps to
terminate its contract with Mercados, and to allocate remaining funds ($1.4M) to new
tasks that will support its capacity to implement its Policy Paper for the Electricity Sector
and reforms in the Lebanese electricity sector.

This restructuring will extend the Closing Date of the Project to allow the Government of
Lebanon to complete the project and meet the PDOs

The Government intends to allocate remaining funds in at least two of the following
areas: a) support for the development of a roadmap for corporatization of EdL; b) further
study of Liquefied Natural Gas (LNG) as a potential means to reform Lebanon's fuel
supply and reduce the average cost of electricity; and, c) hire of individual specialists to
support the Ministry of Energy and Water in implementing its Policy Paper and reform
plans. If these tasks are successfully implemented the Bank team is of the view that the
project will meet its PDOs.



PROPOSED CHANGES

   ·   Project's Development Objectives: The PDOs for the project remain unchanged.
       The objective of this project is to accelerate the implementation of electricity
       sector reforms and restructuring of EdL by enhancing the capacity of MOEW,
       EdL and the multi-ministry higher level committee.

   ·   Results/indicators: Although the PDOs and Project Components remain
       unchanged, the scope of consulting services that will be provided in support of the
       Government's implementation of electricity reform is different. For this reason
       results indicators have been revised. New results indicators are shown in the
       attached Results Framework (Annex 1).

   ·   Components: There is no change in the Project Components. Support of
       Government capacity to implement electricity sector reforms will continue to be
       provided through consulting services contracts. There is therefore no change in
       project design. The detailed scope of the consulting services being provided has
       however changed in order to more accurately support the Government's policy
       directions.

   ·   Closing date: The proposed extension of the Closing Date from December 31,
       2010 to December 31, 2012 is necessary to allow the Borrower to terminate its
       current contract with Mercados, re-commit funds to other tasks that will support
       the achievement of the PDOs, and then complete these tasks. The Ministry of

                                             4
     Energy and Water has provided the Bank with Terms of Reference for the new
     tasks that will be funded by the project, and has outlined an implementation
     schedule for these tasks that will see them completed before the end of 2012. The
     Bank team believes that this implementation schedule is achievable. This will be
     the second extension of the project. Further details on the extension of the
     Closing Date are included in Annex 2.

 ·   Implementation schedule: The implementation schedule for the Project has
     changed by nature of the fact that the Government of Lebanon will commit
     remaining project funds to new consulting services contracts in support of its
     capacity to implement reforms. The Government will require 6 months to procure
     new Consultants to support corporatization of EdL and reform of fuel supply
     through further conceptual study of LNG options. These consulting assignments
     will then require 18 months to implement. Details of the new implementation
     schedule including a revised procurement schedule are included in Annex 3.



APPRAISAL SUMMARY
 There is no change of impact of the project from the original Appraisal Summary of
 the PAD.

                         Extension of Closing Date

_______________________________________________________________________

1. The closing date for LB-Emergency Power Sector Reform Capacity Reinforcement
   Project, Grant No. TF058084, P104774 will be extended from December 31, 2010
   until December 31, 2012.

2. The project has funded three consulting assignments in support of reform of the
   Lebanese electricity sector through a $5M Grant. These included a contract with
   Decon to support strategy and planning within the Ministry of Energy and Water; a
   contract with Azorom to support the improved performance of Electricite du Leban
   (EdL); and a contract with Mercados to support corporatization of EdL. The first two
   of these consulting assignments have been completed satisfactorily, and have in part
   contributed to the development of a Policy Paper for Lebanon's Electricity Sector that
   was endorsed by the Lebanese Council of Ministers in June 2010. However, the third
   contract with Mercados, to support the corporatization of EdL, had effectively stalled
   due to lack of political consensus around the form of corporatization that Mercados
   had recommended.

3. In August, 2010 the Bank wrote to the Government of Lebanon urging it to take
   action with respect to its contract with Mercados and thereby improve the
   performance of the project. At this stage, as reflected in the most recent ISR for this
   project, the Bank downgraded the project's performance in meeting its project
   development objectives (PDOs) from Marginally Unsatisfactory to Unsatisfactory. In
   October, 2010 the Bank again wrote to the Government of Lebanon, outlining the
   actions the Government would need to take if the project was to be extended and
   remaining funds utilized.

4. The Government has now responded to the Bank's request, and is taking steps to
   terminate its contract with Mercados, and to allocate remaining funds ($1.4M) to new
   tasks that will support of implementation of its Policy Paper for the Electricity Sector.
   The Government intends to allocate remaining funds in at least two of the following
   areas: a) support for the development of a roadmap for corporatization of EdL; b)
   further study of Liquefied Natural Gas (LNG) as a potential means to reform
   Lebanon's fuel supply and reduce the average cost of electricity; and, c) hire of
   individual specialists to support the Ministry of Energy and Water in implementing its
   Policy Paper and reform plans. If these tasks are successfully implemented the Bank
   team is of the view that the project will meet its PDOs.

5. The proposed extension is necessary to allow the Borrower to terminate its current
   contract with Mercados, re-commit funds to other tasks that will support the
   achievement of the PDOs, and then complete these tasks. The Ministry of Energy
   and Water has provided the Bank with Terms of Reference for the new tasks that will
   be funded by the project, and has outlined an implementation schedule for these tasks
   that will see them completed before the end of 2012. The Bank team believes that
   this implementation schedule is achievable.

6. This will be the second extension of the project: Upon election of a new Lebanese
   Government in 2009, the Bank extended the Closing Date for the project from
   December 31, 2009 to December 31, 2010 to allow for the incoming government to
   improve the performance of the project. The new Minister of Energy and Water took
   some time to establish the Ministry's electricity sector strategies. However, since
   establishing these strategies, it has responded well to the Bank's request for attention
   to this project. Based on the Government's recent performance in resolving issues
   affecting project progress, the Bank team is supporting this second extension of the
   project Closing Date to allow the Ministry of Energy and Water time to complete the
   project and to meet its PDOs.

7. This project currently has no outstanding or unsatisfactory audit reports.

                       Implementation/Procurement Schedule


_______________________________________________________________________



Upon extension of this project the Government of Lebanon intends to use remaining
funds according to the following action plan, to meet the objectives of this project:

   1) Component 1: Capacity Building of Ministry of energy and Water.

This component has already been partially completed through the hire of Decon to
support the Ministry of Energy and Water in the development of power sector strategies
including a fuel supply strategy. Decon's work has indirectly supported development of
a Policy Paper for the Electricity sector.

The Government will use some remaining funds to fund support to the Ministry of
Energy and Water in implementing reforms by:

       a) Hiring consultants to complete assessment of alternative fuel supply by further
          conceptual study of the development of LNG fuel supply; and
       b) Hiring individual consultants to support Ministry of Energy and Water in the
          implementation of the 10 key pillars of its Policy Paper for the Electricity
          Sector.

   2) Component 2: Support to Multi-Ministry Higher Level Committee and Higher Council
      for Privatization.

This component will be completed by terminating the stalled contract with Mercados, and
hiring a new consultant to develop a roadmap for the corporatization of EdL.

   3) Component 3: EdL restructuring and improvement of performance

This component of the Project has already been addressed by the Azorom contract and
therefore none of the funds remaining under the project will be dedicated to this
component.

The Government of Lebanon will therefore complete the Project by procuring the
following Consultants:
       a) LNG specialist for conceptual (pre-feasibility) study;
       b) Corporatization specialist for roadmap to corporatize EdL
       c) Up to four individual consultants to support implementation of its Policy
           Paper for the Electricity sector.

Consultants will be hired according to the following Procurement Schedule.

                                           16
The Government estimates that it all consultants will be hired by June 2011, and that
these consulting contracts will be completed within an 18 month period, therefore
meaning the project will be completed by end of December 2012.

The Government has established an Implementation Management Unit (IMU) within the
Ministry of Energy and Water to oversee implementation of the remainder of the project.
In conjunction with the Council for Development and Reconstruction (CDR) this IMU
will manage procurement of Consultants and ensure the quality of these Consultants
work. The IMU will report directly to the Minister of Energy and Water, and will
coordinate with Ministry of Finance and Higher Commission for Privatization as
necessary. The IMU will maintain regular contact with the World Bank team.
