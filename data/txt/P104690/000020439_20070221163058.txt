Projectdevelopment objective
The development objective of the project is to reduce Haiti'sfinancial vulnerability to natural disasters
through insurance coverage against earthquakes and hurricanes. This will be achieved through the
establishment of the Caribbean Catastrophe Risk Insurance Facility (CCRIF) and the financing of
catastrophe insurancecoverage from the Facility.

Projectdescription

The proposedprojectaims to provideHaiti with insurancecoverage against naturaldisasters (earthquakes
and hurricanes). The project will finance the entrance fee and the annual insurance premiums (for three
years) necessaryto participateinthe CCRIF. The coverage providedwould helpthe Government of Haiti
face immediate liquidity needsemerging from the occurrence of a disaster.

The IDA Grant will be provided in four installmentsissued to CCRIF at the request of the Ministry of
Economy and Finance (MEF). The grant will be withdrawn by the MEF for direct payment to the
Facility. The project will include the following two components: (a) payment of entrance fee; and (b)
payment of annual insurancepremiumfor the first three years.

     Comuonent 1: Payment of the entrance fee to the CCRIF (US2.57million) - The objective of this
     component is to assist Haiti injoining the CCRIF through the financing of the entrance fee. This fee
     i s equal to the first year's insurance premiumof US$2.57 million.

     Comuonent 2: Payment of annual insurance uremium (US6.43 million) - The objective of this
     component is to assist Haiti in purchasing the catastrophe insurance coverage offeredby the CCRIF
     duringthe first three years.

Which safeguardpoliciesare triggered, if any?

The projectcontemplates no direct physicalinvestments. Instead, the project will finance payments from
the Ministry of Economy andFinanceto the CCRIF. No safeguardswill be triggered.

Significant,non-standardconditions,if any, for:

The effectiveness of the Grant will be conditionedon (a) the formal registrationof the CCRIF; (b) the
commitment of at least eight participatingcountries to the CCRIF; and (c) the opening of a commercial
bank account by the CCRIF in an institution, andon terms andconditions,acceptableto IDA.

I. STRATEGICCONTEXTANDRATIONALE

A. Country and sector issues

   1.     Haiti is highly exposed to adverse natural events (including hurricanes, earthquakes,
  flooding, and landslides), which can result in disasters affecting the country's entire
  economic, human, and physical environment. On average, at least one major hurricane and
  numerous tropical storms cross the Caribbean each year, often impacting Haiti. A major
  hurricane strikes Haiti every seven years on average. For many reasons, ranging from the
  growing concentration of assets to poor environmental management, the loss burden from
  natural disasters is increasing (see Box 1).

  2.     These catastrophic events can result in disasters affecting Haiti's physical, human, and
  economic environment and, as a consequence, the fiscal situation of the Government of Haiti
  (GoH). Larger countries can generally absorb the impact of these adverse natural events b y
  subsidizing the affected region with revenues from unaffected regions.             This type of
  geographic diversification of risk is limited in Haiti. Constrained by its size and borrowing
  capacity, Haiti is less able to cope with losses from natural adverse events, and lacks
  resilience to the onset of disasters.

  3.     While Haiti has a very limited capacity to spread risk geographically, the country's
  inhibited borrowing capacity also prevents it from spreading its risk over time through access
  to credit. Historically, Caribbean countries that experience natural adverse events generally
  see their access to credit and/or grants dramatically reduced right at the time when they need
  it most, limitingtheir capacity to respond to emergency needs. The limited lines of financing
  that are available, including International Monetary Fund (IMF) contingent facilities, often
  take time to materialize and add to the debt burden, as they must usually be repaid in a very
  short time frame.

  4.     Haiti also has very limited access to international insurance markets. High transaction
  costs, the inability to spread risk over a large territory, and the relatively small business
  brought to the market keep insurance penetration in the country to a minimum (non-life
  insurance premium volume is less than 0.6 percent of gross domestic product [GDP]). Inthe
  absence of easy access to debt and well-functioning insurance markets, most of the economic
  losses stemming from adverse natural events are borne by the Haitian government and
  affected households.

  5.     As a result of its small size and limited access to credit and insurance, Haiti depends on
  extensive financing from international donors to fund post-disaster needs. Unfortunately,
  donor assistance often takes many months to materialize, and usually supports specific
  infrastructure projects.   A critical challenge confronting the GoH in the aftermath of a
  disaster i s the need for short-term liquidity to maintain essential government services until
  additional resources become available.

 Of particular concernto the small states of the CaribbeanBasin is the recurrent damage due to hurricanes
 traversing the region. The CaribbeanBasin lies directly in the track of storms originating in the Atlantic
 Ocean, many of which ultimately affect North America. The impact of hurricanes is highly variable.
 Duringthe last 27 years, 1979-2005 inclusive, 13 years were "loss free," with no significant damage to
 any Caribbeancountry. Ineight of the remainingyears a single storm caused losses in the Caribbean. In
 six years significant damage was causedby multiple storms. In2004, for example, four storms (Charley,
 Frances, Ivan, and                         as they crossed th egion, causingcombined losses of almost
 US$4.5 billion.

             also cause damage to multiple countries. One storm, Ivan, in 2004, affected eight different
             ng 1979-2005, losses totaledUS$16.6 billion (incurrent value), or US$613 million annually.
 Of equal importance to the frequency with which hurricanes occur is the size of the loss to a country
 when a storm strikes. The record shows that storm losses to private property, state infrastructure, and
 other state property can be considerable. When Hurricane Ivan struck Grenada in 2004, the loss was
 calculated at US$800 million, about two times the country's gross domestic product, of which
 governmentlosses accountedfor about 30 percent.


     6.     The Caribbean Catastrophe Risk Insurance Facility (CCRIF, or Facility) would provide
     participating countries with an insurance instrument that would help shelter them from
     natural disasters. The Facility will enable governments to purchase catastrophe insurance
     coverage against adverse natural events, such as a major earthquake or the passing of a
     hurricane (see Box 2). As of January 30, 2007, 16 Caribbean countries have confirmed their
     participation into the CCRIF including Dominica, Grenada, St. Lucia, St. Vincent and the
     Grenadines, Anguilla, Belize, The Bahamas, Barbados, Bermuda, The British Virgin Islands,
     The Cayman Islands, Haiti, Jamaica, Montserrat, St. Kitts and Nevis and Turks and Caicos
     Islands. This high level of enrollment will allow the CCRIF to efficiently diversify its
     portfolio and thus access reinsurance on better terms.

     7.     Natural disasters have been found to have a disproportionate impact on the poorer
     segments of the population. Low-income households often settle in the most vulnerable
     areas and live inpoorly constructed housing. With low savings the poor are also less able to
     cope economically. Being more vulnerable to the onset of disaster, and least prepared to
     cope with their effects, the poor are often heavily dependent on government recovery
     programs. The proposed CCRIF will provide the GoH with immediate access to liquidity,
     allowing the government to respond more effectively to the initial needs of the poor resulting
     from these events.

     8.    The Hyogo Framework for Action 2005-2015, signed in January 2005, identifies the
     need to "promote the development of financial risk-sharing mechanisms, particularly
     insurance and reinsurance against disasters," as a priority action for "Building the Resilience
     of Nations and Communities to Disasters."' While this i s only one recommendation among
     many, the need for innovative risk financing mechanisms is particularly relevant to Haiti

                        strophe Risk Insurance Facility (CCRIF) will all0 CARICOM governments to
  purchaseinsurance coverage to finance immediate post-disaster recovery needs.
  The Facility will act as a risk aggregator. The CCRIF will allow participating countries to pool their
  country-specific risks into one, better-diversified portfolio. This diversification should result in a
  substantial reductionin premium cost of up to 45-50 percent.
  Claims payments will depend on parametric triggers. Index-based (or parametric) insurance
  instruments pay claims based on the occurrence of a pre-defined event rather than an assessment of
  actual losses on the ground. This measurement, maderemotely by an independent agency, allows for
  transparent, low settlement costs and quick-disbursing contracts.
  The Facility will be created with initialfundingfiom donors. Initial funding is neededto allow the
  Facility to cover start-up costs, retain some of the risk and access the reinsurance markets where it is
  most efficient.
  The Facility will transfer the risks it cannot retain to the internationalfinancial markets. This will
  be done through reinsurance or through other financial coverage instruments (for example,
  catastrophe bonds). The accumulation of reserves over time should lessen the Facility's dependence
  on outside risktransfer, and smooth the catastrophereinsurance pricing cycle.
  The Facility will develop afinancial strategy for surviving 1-in-200-year events. Should the total
  insured losses exceed its claims-paying capacity; payouts will be prorated based on the total amount
  of expected claims compared to the remaining available funds. The CCRIF will then seek donors'
  contributions and/or private capital for its recapitalization.
  The CCRIF will be established as an independent legal entity. It will be created as an Insurance
  Captive Special Purpose Vehicle (SPV) owned by a trust. Both entities will be registered in the
  Cayman Islands, a market leader in Insurance Captives. The CCRIF will be managed by a Captive
  Manager under the supervision of a Board of Directors composed of representatives from the donors
  and participating countries. This Board will be supported by the technical advice of a specialized
  Facility Supervisor. The World Bank will not sit on the Board, but will retain certain control in the
  initial phase through a grant agreement to be entered between the Captive SPV and the International
  Development Association (IDA) as a trustee of the IDA multi-donor trust fund for the CCRIF (the
  IDA Trust Fund). The grant agreement will set forth the terms and conditions under which grant
  funds are provided and how those funds can be used. Operational manual of the Facility will be
  reviewedand approved by the World Bank before disbursementsof funds from the IDA Trust Fund.
  Insured countries will pay an annual premium commensu                          their own specific risk
                arametric insurance products will be priced for eac               based on the individual
                               a1 premiums will typically vary from             ,000 to US$4 million for
  coverage ranging from US$10million to US$50million. The objective of the Facility i s to provide
  immediate liquidity (which will account for a relatively small portion of total losses) to participating
  governments affected by a major hurricane or earthquake to help them to quickly jumpstart recovery
  efforts, while mobilizing resourcesfrom other sources to cover the full costs.
  The Facility could serve as a pilot program to be extended or replicated to other small states (such
  as the Pacific Island states). Extending the pool to small states beyond the Caribbean that face
  similar natural hazards would provide further opportunities for risk diversification, thus lowering the
  cost of insurance. This extension would require the development of sophisticated probabilistic risk
  models for the regions involved (Pacific and Indian Ocean).

B. Rationalefor Bankinvolvement

    9.     Following the devastation caused by hurricanes in the Caribbean in 2004, the
    Caribbean Community and Common Market (CARICOM) Heads o f State requested World
    Bank assistance with gaining access to affordable and effective disaster risk financing
    instruments. In January 2006, with Grant funding from the Government o f Japan, the World
    Bank initiated the preparatory studies for the establishment o f the CCRIF. The Facility will
    allow small states to purchase insurance coverage against potential revenue losses from
    hurricanes and earthquakes.

     10. The World Bank has been working with the GoH over the past three years on the
    development and implementation of the Emergency Recovery and Disaster Management
    Project, aimed at reducing the country's physical vulnerability and strengthening their
    emergency management capacity. The CCRIF thus complements ongoing activities in
    disaster risk management in Haiti. Furthermore, Haiti i s the least-developed country among
    those expected to join the Facility and therefore i s most inneed of assistance (see Box 3).

Box 3. Rationalefor the World Bank's Involvementinthe Creation of the CCRIF

Caribbean government access to catastrophe insurance and reinsurance is limited because of high
transaction costs resulting from the relatively small business brought to the reinsurance market. In the
absence of an effective insurance market, catastrophe insurance pools turn out to be a better funding
solution that reservefunds for infrequent events.
Aside from the economic inefficiencies involved in governments providing post-disaster funding, it is
unrealistic to expect governments to create reserves that could accumulate over a long period without
these funds being subje                       immediate claims.       In addition, national catastrophe risk
aggregators are not effic                      ies with a c          ated risk exposure, like Haiti. In this
context, only a regional                        osed CCRIF           Ip Caribbean governments finance their
risks through risk pooling, risk retention, and risk transfer (using reinsurance or alternative risk financing
solutions).
The World Bank is well positionedto leverage resources of international reinsurers and capital markets to
develop effective and competitively pricedcatastropheinsurance for the Caribbean countries.
Convening power: Using its intricate knowledge of the client countries, its relationship with donors, and
the reputation of impartiality with the countries and the international reinsurance market, the World Bank
can play a catalytic role in the development of an efficient partnership among countries, donors, and
private markets inthe financing of catastrophic risks.
Technical expertise:    The highly technical and specialized nature of setting up the Facility has
                                                                     e legal, fiduciary, and catastrophe risk
                                                                                pport of the Government of
                                                                                 quired technical inputs and
oversight to this proje                                                          ts supported by the Bank is
provided inAnnex 14.
The CCRIF will create a new demand for catastrophereinsurance, thus providing the private reinsurance
andcapital markets with new business opportunities.

C. Higher-levelobjectivesto which the projectcontributes

    11. Inthe higher-level strategic context, the project contributes to the objective spelled out
   inSection IV of the MillenniumDevelopment Goals, underscoring the need "to intensify our
   collective effort to reduce the number and effects of natural and man made disasters."

    12.  The project is included in the expected program outlined in the World Bank's Interim
   Strategy Note (ISN) approved by the Board on January 30, 2007. The project will
   complement the ongoing Emergency Recovery and Disaster Management Project.

    13.  B y encouraging the GoH to purchase catastrophe insurance from the Facility through
   the provision of an International Development Association (IDA) grant, the Facility will be
   able to provide insurance coverage at a lower cost to all participating countries. The lower
   cost would be achieved through the increased risk diversification that would be realized by
   including more countries inthe risk pool.

11.    PROJECTDESCRIPTION

A. Lendinginstrument

   14.   The Haiti Catastrophe Insurance Project will be financed by an IDA Grant in the
   amount of SDR 6 million (US$9 million equivalent). The Grant will finance payments for
   Haiti's entrance fee to the CCRIF and three annual premiums.

B. Projectdevelopmentobjectiveandkey indicators

   15.   The development objective of the project is to reduce Haiti'sfinancial vulnerability to
   natural disasters through insurance coverage against earthquakes and hurricanes. This will
   be achieved by providing financing to Haiti to allow it to join the CCRIF and purchase
   financial protection against catastrophic earthquake and/or hurricane events. Without the
   IDA Grant, it is unlikely that Haiti would join this pilot initiative, which represents the first
   entity created to protect small island states from the financial impact of natural disasters. As
   such, the project supports the establishment and viability of the CCRIF.

   16.   The key intermediate indicators for the project are:

      0  The total claim paying capacity of the CCRIF;
      0  The total sum insuredfor each country.

C. Projectcomponents

   17.   The proposed project aims to provide Haiti with insurance coverage against natural
   disasters (earthquakes and hurricanes). The project will finance the entrance fee and the
   annual insurance premiums (for three years) necessary to participate in the CCRIF. The
   coverage provided would help the GoH face immediate liquidity needs emerging from the
   occurrence of a disaster.



                                                 5

   18.   The IDA Grant will be provided infour installmentsissuedto CCRIF at the request of
  the Ministry of Economy and Finance (MEF). The Grant will be withdrawn by the MEFfor
   direct payment into the Facility. The project will include the following two components: (a)
  payment of the entrance fee and (b) payment of the annual insurance premium for the first
   three years.

   Component 1: Payment of the entrance fee to the CCRIF (US$2.57million)

   19.    The objective of this component is to assist Haiti in joining the CCRIF through the
   financing of the entrance fee. This fee i s equal to the first year's insurance premium of
  US2.57 million.

   Component2: Payment of annual insurance premium(US$6.43million)

   20.    The objective of this component is to assist Haiti in purchasing the catastrophe
   insurance coverage offered by the CCRIF during the first three years. The estimated annual
   premiumsare detailedinTable 1.2

   21.    Soon after its establishment in March 2007, the CCRIF will collect the entrance fee
   and first year premium for each participating country. Premium payments will need to be
   submitted inApril 2007,2008, and 2009.

D. Lessonslearnedandreflectedinthe projectdesign

   22.    Lessons can be learned from a previous attempt to develop a similar risk financing
   instrument for the Eastern Caribbean that failed for the following reasons: fairly mild
  hurricane season 2001-2003; lack of preparatory funds to support the preliminary studies
  required to implement the Facility, including the development of regional catastrophe risk
   models; worries about possible cross-subsidization among participating countries; and
   insufficient political support for the insurance solution proposed at that time.

   23,   However, the region experienced major hurricanes in2004 (including Hurricane Ivan),
  thus raising awareness among governments. This lead to an official request to the World
  Bank for assistance with gaining access to affordable and effective disaster risk financing
  arrangements. The World Bank team obtained grant financing to support all preparatory
  work from the Government of Japan. State-of-the art catastrophic risk modeling techniques
  were used to develop country risk profiles and to design and price parametric insurance
  products for each country based on the individual country risk profile, thus addressing
  concerns of participating countries over potential cross-subsidization. Finally, the present

The projectwill finance 100%of halfof the third year premium.

   initiative was developed at the request of the CARICOM Heads, who have continuously
   provided strong support for the initiative. The project was designed using local expertise
   whenever available in close consultation with regional governments.               A first regional
   technical meeting and workshop was organized inJamaica on April 28, 2006 and a regional
   meeting with representatives from the CARICOM Ministries of Finance took place in
   Barbados on October 13, 2006.

   24.    The team also drew from recent experience on catastrophe risk financing, including the
   development of parametric insurance solutions and catastrophe insurance pools.
        0  Needfor initial reserves. Previous experience in setting up insurance pools shows
           that there is a need for initial capital inthe pool to make it financially sustainable over
           the long run. The lack of sufficient risk seed capital exposes the pool to reinsurance
           price volatility, thus affecting the stability of the insurance premiums. The CCRIF
           has been seeking donor contributions to finance the Facility's initial reserves and its
           operating expenditures for the first years of operation.
        0  Needfor transparency. The catastrophe reinsurance market includes a very limited
           number of players, making this market opaque and informationally asymmetric. This
           lack of transparency i s to the detriment of the client countries. The CCRIF has
           developed country-specific catastrophe risk models to allow for the pricing of
           catastrophe insurance products. The CCRIF has also explored several avenues for the
           transfer of risk, including the role of the World Bank Treasury as a financial
           intermediary.
       0   Critical business volume. A minimum amount of business is required to access the
           catastrophe insurance market on competitive terms. As of January 30, 2007, 16
           countries have confirmed their participation inthe CCRIF.

E. Alternatives considered andreasonsfor rejection

   25.    A first alternative considered for the project was to not provide an IDA Grant to the
   GoH and to hope that the government would still participate in the Facility. The CCRIF is
  the first global pilot for providing catastrophe insurance coverage to small states, and i s
  therefore a relatively risky endeavor. Haiti has the lowest financial capacity to purchase the
  catastrophe insurance among the Caribbean countries. This makes Haiti more risk averse to
  new initiatives and less able than its neighboring countries to pay the entrance fee and the
  annual premium. To encourage the GoH to participate, it was therefore agreed that it would
  be necessary to provide an IDA grant to finance its participation.

  26.     A second alternative would have been to create a post-disaster emergency fund.
  However, the World Bank does not have a quick-disbursing financial instrument that would
  allow for fast and reliable financing of liquidity needs. This would also discourage proactive
  riskmanagement on the part of Caribbean countries, such as looking into insurance solutions.
  Finally, such a fund would allow for one recovery operation instead of setting up the ongoing
  concern proposed under the CCRIF.

111.    IMPLEMENTATION

 A. Partnershiparrangements

    27.    The World Bank is working in close collaboration with the donor community,
    including the United Kingdom's Department for International Development (DFID), the
    Canadian International Development Agency (CIDA), the European Commission (EC), the
    United States Agency for International Development (USAID), and the FrenchDevelopment
    Agency (AFD). A donor pledging conference i s scheduled inFebruary 26,2007.

    28.    The Caribbean Development Bank (CDB) is also supporting the development of the
    Facility by making funds available to member countries to finance the insurance premium.

 B. Institutionalandimplementationarrangements

    29.    The Grant proceeds will be transferred on an annual basis from the IDA to the CCRIF
    account at the request of Haiti's MEF. To obtain funds, the MEF will submit a withdrawal
    application for the value of the entry fee and/or premium. The payment exercise will be made
    by April 2007,2008,2009.

 C. Monitoringandevaluationof outcomeshesults

    30.    The proposed project aims to reduce the GoH's financial vulnerability to natural
    disasters by providing insurance coverage against earthquakes and hurricanes. The project
    will meet its development objectives if Haiti benefits from catastrophe insurance coverage
    (against hurricanes and earthquakes) for the period of the project. Monitoring and evaluation
    of the project will be conducted on an annual basis. The World Bank team will liaise with
    the Haitian MEF and the Facility to ensure that the premiumpayment has been made on time
    and that Haiti is covered by the Facility.

 D. Sustainability

    3 1. To encourage continuous participation, members of the CCRIF will be requiredto pay
    an entrance fee that i s lost should they leave the Facility. It should be noted that it is highly
    likely that one or more countries participating in the CCRIF will be affected by an insured
    event during the project execution period, and will draw on the insurance coverage provided
    by the CCRIF. This will confirm the utility of the risk financing instrument. It is expected
    that this demonstration effect will reinforce the commitment of Haiti to continue their
    participation inthe CCRIF.

    32.    Given Haiti's fiscal constraints, it is unlikely that the government will be able to
    finance premium costs from its own budget once IDA resources are exhausted. Recognizing
    this reality, the World Bank will work with the Haitian MEF and the donor community to
    ensure Haiti's continued participation after the closing of this project.

     Larger sustainability issues relate to the continuous operation of the CCRIF, including the
     risk that could result from insufficient reserves, the risk that the CCRIF could default on its
     obligation, low participation, low renewal of participating countries, and hardening of the
     reinsurance market, A discussionof these risks, including mitigation factors is presented in

                                            governments to pull out of the Facility. The CCRIF acting
                                            as a mutual insurance vehicle, it is also expected that peer

IV.     APPRAISAL SUMMARY

 A. Economicand financialanalyses

    34.    A portfolio risk model coupled with a pricing model was developed to estimate the
    cost of catastrophe insurance offered by the CCRIF. Its cost i s driven by the number of
    participating countries and their demand for catastrophe insurance, donor contributions, and
    costs of reinsurance. Because some of these variables are not fully known yet, only
    insurancecoverage ranges are provided.

    35.    Hurricane insurance and earthquake insurance policies are designed with a 1-in-30-
    year attachment point and a 1-in-200-year exhaustion point3. The corresponding dollar
    values are given inTable 2.

   36.     The financial benefits of the CCRIF to Haiti are first assessed through the reduction in
   the estimated insurance premiumcompared to the case where the country would have to buy
   the same coverage individually.              Such catastrophe insurance coverage i s currently not
   available for the Caribbean countries in general and for Haiti in particular. It is therefore
   very difficult to estimate the cost of such individual coverage when the market does not exist.
   A hypothetical individual insurance premium is derived through a basic pricing equation
   based on the expected loss; the 200-year probable maximum loss and the opportunity cost of
   reserves. The individual insurance premium rates are compared with the expected premium


     The Attachment Point refers to the dollar value of the modeled loss at which the insurance payout is triggered.
    The ExhaustionPoint refers to the dollar value at which the insurancecoverage is exhausted.

    rates the Facility will ask for the same coverage. It is estimated that the cost of insurance
    provided by the CCRIF to Haiti is 45-50 percent less expensive. This premiumreduction is
    mainlydriven by the benefits of risk pooling.

    37.    This premium comparison is mainly theoretical because Haiti does not have currently
    access to catastrophe insurance and, even if the Government did have access, they may not
    purchase catastrophe insurance if they perceive this financial product as too expensive.
    Should Haiti be risk neutral, the cost of self-retention would be estimated through the annual
    average loss over a long time period. This assumption i s consistent with Arrow and Lind
    (1970),4 who state that governments should be risk neutral toward natural disasters and thus
    they should not invest in any risk financing strategies that are more expensive than the
    expected losses caused by a natural disaster. This theory is in fact implementedby a number
    of large developed countries that rely on post-disaster financing (including budget
    reallocation and tax increases) to finance catastrophic losses. However, this theory fails in
    the case of a small and highly indebted country like Haiti because it can spread the risk
    neither across space (geographical spread) nor across time (inter-temporal spread). The cost
    of self-retention i s assumed to be equal to the annual average loss plus the opportunity cost of
    reserves. The opportunity cost of reserves is equal to the amount of reserves necessary to
    survive a 1-in-200 year event, multiplied by the marginal opportunity cost of capital (set at
    12%). The estimated CCRIF insurance premium is shown to be 50-60 percent lower to the
    cost of self-retention if Haiti had to self-retain this risk through reserves.

B. Technical

    38.    The objective of the CCRIF-for          which this pro ect will finance the entrance fee and
    the insurance premiumof Haiti for the.first three years -is to offer affordable and effective
                                                                 3
    catastrophe insurance to the CARICOM states. The need for such insurance stems from the
    inability of CARICOM countries to spread the risk within the country, to access international
    reinsurance markets, and from their limited borrowing capacity.

    39.    The CCRIF offers parametric hurricane insurance and parametric earthquake insurance
    to its members. These financial instruments aim at providing immediate liquidity should a
    hurricane and/or an earthquake hit the insured islands. The benefits reaped from the Facility
    include (a) effective risk diversification resulting from a large pool of risks spread across the
    Caribbean basin and across perils (hurricane and earthquake), (b) optimal risk transfer to
    global reinsurance and capital markets, and (c) efficient ex ante leveraging of donor support.

    40.    A simple but robust insurance portfolio model was developed to assess the benefits of
    the CCRIF. Table 3 shows the estimated hurricane and earthquake coverage with an
    estimated 1-in-30 year attachment point and a 1-in-200 year exhaustion point.

Note: Estimated insurance coverage is subject to change based on countries' participation, donors'

   41.    CCRIF insurance premiums are estimated to be 45-50 percent lower than if each
   country had to purchase catastrophe insurance individually.       This premium reduction is
   mainly driven by the impact of risk diversification in the CCRIF insurance portfolio. In
   particular, the amount of reserves required for the Facility to survive a 1-in-200-year event
   can be reducedup to 75 percent if 17 Caribbeancountriesjoin the Facility (see Figure 1).

    contracts to be financed will be with the CCRIF (the insurance policy), there will not be a
    need for a procurement plan. Haiti's participation in the project Financial Management will
    be limited to the annual submission of a withdrawal application requesting direct payment
    from the World Bank to the CCRIF. The Haitian MEFhas sufficient capacity to do so. The
    World Bank team will closely monitor the project implementation process to ensure that
    payments are requestedand transferred on time. Furtherdetails canbe found inAnnex 7.

D. Social

    43.      The project is expected to have positive indirect poverty and social impacts. These
    include the improved ability of the Haitian Government to meet the needs of its most
    vulnerable population in the immediate aftermath of a catastrophic event. An immediate
    infusion of capital will enable it to jumpstart recovery efforts quickly, limiting the liquidity
    impact on the government budget. The liquidity provided immediately after the event will
    allow the Government to focus its efforts on providing direct assistance to the most affected
    citizens instead of working to raise funds from the international community to start the
    recovery.

E. Environment

    44.      The availability of liquidity inthe aftermathof a disaster has been identified as one of
    the main impediments in starting recovery efforts. Positive indirect impacts of the project
    include the improved ability of the Government to deal with environmental implications of
    natural disasters.

                          The CaribbeanCatastropheRisk InsuranceFacility

Background

1. The Caribbean region is hit by a major natural disaster, on average, every two to three
     years. Due to the small size of most states in the region, disasters tend to affect entire
     economies. Hurricane Ivan, for example, resultedin losses of over 200 percent of GDP in
     Grenada. Following the devastating hurricane season of 2004, the Caribbean Community
     and Common Market (CARICOM) Heads of Government requested World Bank help in
     developing a Caribbean Catastrophe Risk Insurance Facility (CCRIF, or the Facility) for
     CARICOM member states. Japan provided a $1.8 million grant under the Japan Policy and
     Human Resources Development (PHRD) Fund to undertake the necessary feasibility
     studies.

2. Haiti cannot spread its risk geographically because of its small size, or over time (through
     borrowing) because of the country's high debt levels. Yet, as a result of its geographic
     location, two or more islands are rarely affected by the same hurricane, and the region
     provides a fairly well-diversified portfolio of risk. The proposed Facility would allow
     Caribbean states to pool their disaster risk into one well-diversified portfolio that would
     helpthem access the international reinsurancemarketat very competitive rates.

3. As requestedby CARICOM, the Bank i s using its convening power to facilitate creation of
     the Facility. As of January 30, 2007, 16 countries had confirmed their participation in the
     CCRIFa6The same convening power is also being usedto mobilize donor financial support
     for the Facility in order to make it attractive and affordable for countries to join.7 Donors
     and Caribbean countries expect that the Bank will also be making a financial contribution
     to start the Facility.

4. The Facility could serve as a pilot program to be extended or replicated to other small
     states (such as the Pacific Island states). Extending the pool to small states beyond the
     Caribbean that face similar natural hazards would provide further opportunities for risk
     diversification, thus lowering the cost of insurance. This extension would require the
     development of sophisticatedprobabilistic risk models for the regions involved (Pacific and
     Indian Ocean).

PrincipalFeatures of the Facility

5. The proposed Facility will be established as an independent entity, capitalized by donor
   partners. It will have the following features:

       0    The Facility will allow CARICOM governments to purchase insurance coverage
            akin to business interruption insurance that would provide them with immediate
            liquidity after a major disaster. Because of the speed at which claims payments
            will be processed, the instrument will be particularly useful to finance immediate
            post-disaster recovery needs, while an affected government seeks funds from other
            sources for long-term reconstruction.

       0    The Facility will act as a risk aggregator b y permitting participating countries to
            pool their country-specific risks into one, better-diversified portfolio. Probabilistic
            risk models developed for the facility indicate that diversification should result in
            a substantial reduction in premium cost. Our initial assessment i s that the cost of
            coverage will be reducedby as much as 45-50 percent.

       0    Claims payments will depend on parametric triggers. Index-based (or parametric)
            insurance instruments pay claims based on the occurrence of a pre-defined event
            rather than an assessment of actual losses on the ground. This measurement i s
            made remotely by an independent agency, resulting in quick processing of claims
            and low settlement costs. Additional benefits from index-based contracts include
            transparent contracts, and reduced adverse selection and moral hazard resulting
            from a better capacity to tailor premium costs to individual risks.

       0    The Facility will be created with initial capital from donors. Initial capital i s
            needed to allow the Facility to retain some of the risk and to access the reinsurance
            markets where it i s most efficient. Additional capital will increase the overall
            resilience of the Facility and have a positive impact on premium costs (that is,
            decreasing them).

       0    The Facility will transfer the risks it cannot retain to the international financial
            markets.    This will be done through reinsurance or through other financial
            coverage instruments (for example, catastrophe bonds).          The accumulation of
            reserves over time should lessen the Facility's dependence on outside risk transfer
            and smooth the catastrophe reinsurance pricing cycle.

            The Facility will be established as an independent legal entity. It will be created
            as an Insurance Captive (Special Purpose Vehicle - SPV), owned by a trust. Both
            entities will be registered in the Cayman Islands, a market leader in Insurance
            Captives.

      0     The Facility will be managed by a specialized Captive Manager under the
            supervisionof a Board of Directors, composed of representatives from the donors
            and clients, and the Board will be supported by the technical advice of a


                                                16

            specialized Facility Supervisor. The Captive Manager will act as corporate
            secretary to the Facility, collecting premiums from insured countries, purchasing
            the necessary reinsurance, and paying claims. The Bank will not sit on the Board,
            but will retain control in the initial phase through a financing agreement with the
            Facility, which would define how donor funds can be used.

       0    Insured countries will pay an annual premium commensurate with their own
            specific risk exposure. Countries will enjoy coveragefor risks related to a specific
            returnperiod. Governmentswill choose the attachment and exhaustion points for
            the coverage (levels of intensity of an earthquake or hurricane between which
            coverage will be in effect).         Annual premiums will typically vary from
            US$200,000 to US$4 million for payouts ranging from US$10 million to US$50
            million.

Operating Structure of the Facility

6. The CCRIF will be managed by a Captive Manager under the supervision of a Board of
   Directors composed of representative donors, and client countries. This Board will be
   supported by the technical advice of a specialized Facility Supervisor. Figure A.1.1shows
   the principal elements inthe organizational structureof the CCRIF.

                                    Legal Aspects




7. The following is a description of the roles and responsibilities of the organizational entities
   identified inFigure A.1.1:

   0  Board of Directors: The CCRIF will be governed by a Board of Directors responsible
      for making strategic decisions, such as the purchase of reinsurance, under the advice of
      the Facility Supervisor (see below). Any variations inthe Facility's operating procedures


                                                 17

         will require Board approval. It i s expected that the Board will include representatives
         from the donors and from the participating countries. The Board will also include one or
         two recognized insurance experts. The Board would meet once or twice a year to review
         the performance of the specialized firms responsible for the Facility's day-to-day
         operations.

         Captive Manager: The Captive Manager will act as the Facility's corporate secretary,
         and manage general day-to-day operations of the Facility under the supervision of the
         Board of Directors. It will execute and confirm all transactions on behalf of the Facility
         according to the operational manual, provide internal accounting and fiduciary services,
         and submit regular reports to the Board and Facility Supervisor. The Captive Manager
         will also ensure adequate systems of internal control, includingthe supervision of annual
         audits. Finally, the Captive Manager will convene meetings of the Board and act as its
         secretary.

         Facility Supervisor: The main function of the Facility Supervisor will be to monitor the
         risk structure of the Facility and advise the Board on risk transfer strategies. As such, it
         will provide regular financial and operational reporting based on the accounting data
         provided by the Captive Manager. The Facility Supervisor will also monitor potential
         triggering events, run trigger index models with data input from reporting agencies, and
         informthe Boardonpayments to be processed.

         Asset Manager:          The Facility will subcontract its asset management function to a
         specialized agency. The Asset Manager will be responsible for the prudent investing of
         the Facility's reserve.

         Placement of Reinsurance: The Facility will be required to purchase reinsurance on an
         annual basis. To do so, the Facility will recruit a reinsurance broker that will manage the
         reinsurance claims processed on behalf of the Facility, including verification of outputs
         from the parametric index models when they are triggered.

         World Bank Treasury: Work i s ongoing to assess whether the World Bank Treasury
         could assist the Facility to swap the risk in the international financial markets. This
         transactionwould greatly reduce the cost of risk capital to the Facility.

Legal Structure of the Facility

8. The CCRIF will be an independent legal entity, registered as a fully capitalized Captive SPV
    inthe Cayman Islands. The Captive SPV will be owned by a commercial trust (the CCRIF
    Trust) also registered inthe Cayman Islands.




*A tender is underway to recruit the Captive Manager to assist the World Bank team in the registration of the
Facility and to act as its manager over the first three years of operation.


                                                            18

The CaptiveSPV

9. A trustee of the CCRIF Trust (the CCRIF Trustee) will establish the Captive SPV. The
    Captive SPV will be a limited liability company whose mainpurpose will be to sell insurance
    coverage to participating countries. This Captive SPV will have its own risk management
    strategy, which will include the purchaseof reinsurance. The Captive SPV will have a Board
    of Directors composed of representatives of the donors,' representatives of the participating
    countries, and one or more insurance specialists.

CCRIF Trust

10. The purpose of the CCRIF Trust will be solely to establish and own the Captive SPV. When
    the CCRIF Trust is operational, its only function will be to own 100 percent of the Captive
    SPV. The beneficiaries of the CCRIF Trust will be the participating countries that buy
    insurancepolicies from the Captive SPV. The CCRIF Trustee will be an entity inthe CCRIF
    Trust's jurisdiction that routinely provides trustee services.

Fundingof the CaptiveSPV

11.The Captive SPV operations will initially be funded by entrance fees from participating
    countries, contributions from donors and subsequently from insurance premiums paid by
    participating countries.

12. In order to participate in the CCRIF, participating countries must contribute an entrance fee
    to the Captive SPV. For each country, the respective entrance fee will be equivalent to the
    amount of the premium such country i s paying for the first year it participates in the CCRIF.
    To provide funding support to the CCRIF, donors may contribute directly to the Captive SPV
    or through an IDA Multi-donor Trust Fund established by IDA. IDA and the Captive SPV
    will enter into a grant agreementthat will set forth the terms and conditions under which IDA
    will disbursefunds from the IDA Trust.

13. Incase of dissolution of the CCRIF, funds remaining inthe IDA Multi-donor Trust Fund will
    be returned to Donors (pursuant to the Trust Fund Administration Agreement entered into
    betweenIDA and each Donor). The assets held by the Captive SPV will revert to the CCRIF
    Trust (as 100 percent owner of the Captive SPV). Upon dissolution of the CCRIF Trust,
    these trust assets will be distributed among the beneficiaries of the CCRIF Trust (that is, the
    participating countries).

14 Since the Captive SPV will be a limited liability company wholly owned by the CCRIF
    Trust, residual risk will be borne by the CCRIF Trust, and will be limited to the amount of
    the Captive SPV's paid incapital. Residual benefit will also be directly on the CCRIF Trust,
    and indirectly on the trust beneficiaries (that is, on the participating countries).



 Although the International Bank for Reconstructionand Development (IBRD) is expected to be a minority donor,
the World Bank will not hold a seat on the Captive SPV's board.

                           Annex 4. Detailed Project Description
                      HAITI: Haiti Catastrophe Insurance Project


1. The proposed project aims to reduce the financial vulnerability of the Government of
Haiti (GoH) by enabling it to benefit from insurance coverage against natural disasters
(earthquakes and hurricanes).       The project will finance the entrance fee and the annual
insurance premiums (for three years) necessary to participate in the Caribbean Catastrophe
Risk Insurance Facility (CCRIF or Facility). Should a strong hurricane or earthquake affect
Haiti, the GoH will receive a substantial insurance payout from the Facility to finance its
immediate liquidity needs or general budget outlays. 1

2. The project consists of the financing of entrance fee and insurance premiums through
four paymentsfrom the MEFto the CCRIF:

    a. Payment of the entrance fee to the CCRIF (US2.57 million). The entrance fee is
        equal to the first year's insurance premium, which is estimated at US$2.57 million.

    b. Payment of annual insurance premium (US$6.43million) during the first three years,
        estimated at:
            1.    Year 1: 100percent of total insurance premium(US$2.57million)
            2.    Year 2: 100percent of total insurance premium (US$2.57million)
            3.    Year 3: 100percent of half the total insurance premium(US$I.29million).

3. Soon after its establishment in spring 2007, the Facility will collect the entrance fee and
first year premium for Haiti.      These payments will thus need to be submitted from the
government of Haiti in March 2007 and the first disbursement of funds i s expected to occur
by April 30, 2007.

4. The outcome of these investments will be the financial protection afforded to Haiti by the
CCRIF. Should Haiti be hit by an insured disaster (earthquake or hurricane), it would
receive an insurance payout of up to US$50 million inthe aftermath of the disaster.

                        HAITI: Haiti CatastropheInsuranceProject


The cost of Haiti's participation in the Caribbean Catastrophe Risk InsuranceFacility (CCRIF)
would be US$10.28 million over a period of three years. The project would involve direct
payments, at the requestof the MEFfrom the World Bank to the CCRIF.

                   HAITI: Haiti CatastropheInsuranceProject

The Haitian Ministry of Economy and Finance (MEF) will be responsible for the
management of this project, although no World Bank funds will flow directly into the
government accounts. Instead, at the request of the MEF, a direct payment will be made
from the World Bank to the Caribbean Catastrophe Risk Insurance Facility (CCRIF or
Facility). World Bank funds will not travel through the Haitian government. Annual audits
are therefore not required for Haiti's accounts.   Instead, audits of the CCRIF will be
conductedon an annual basis.

               Annex 7. FinancialManagementand DisbursementArrangements
                          HAITI: Haiti CatastropheInsuranceProject

1. The proposed project aims to reduce the financial vulnerability of the Government of Haiti
(GoH) by enabling it to benefit from insurance coverage against natural disasters. The proposed
project implementation scheme significantly differs from traditional World Bank-financed
operations.    The project has just two components, which will be fully used to finance the
entrance fees and three-year insurance premiums of the recipient. These amounts would be paid
to the Caribbean Catastrophe Risk Insurance Facility (CCRIF).

2. According to the proposed arrangements, the CCRIF would be established as an independent
legal entity acting as an intermediary between the participating countries and the international
financial markets. It would be managed by a Captive Manager under the supervision of a Board
of Directors composed of representative donors and client countries. Inits infancy, the World
Bank will provide technical support and advice to the Facility. Within three years, it is expected
to become fully independentfrom the World Bank. It is also expected that GoH, benefiting from
an International Development Association (IDA) Grant, will continue to participate in the
Facility after the three-year period either on its own or with support from a donor partner.

3. No overhead, operating expenses or any other activities will be financed by the current
project. According to the implementation scheme, transfer o f the project funds will be done via
four direct payments made at the request of the Haitian Ministry of Economy and Finance (MEF)
from the respective Grant accounts to the CCRIF account. Payments will be made annually by
the 31st of March.

4. Based on the above, many of the traditionally required financial management arrangements
appear not to be relevant to the proposed project design. Since there i s no direct involvement of
the Project Coordination Unit or of the line ministries in the fiduciary aspects of project
implementation, the need to use (and assess) their financial management systems and personnel
i s eliminated.

ProjectRisk

5. Inherent risks. One of the main cross-cutting inherent project risks relates to Haiti's ability
to pay required insurance premiums once project support ends. To address this issue, the
insurance coverage will be set at a level that makes it affordable for Haiti following the end of
the project. In addition, the Grant will cover 100 percent of half of the insurance premium for
the third year, thus preparing the country to finance the cost of insurance from its other sources
inthe following year.

6. Control risks. The project's control risk i s associated with the capacity of the MEF to
prepare withdrawal applications and submit them to the World Bank once a year. The MEFhas
the requiredcapacity.

7. Overall risk. Due to the novelty of the project arrangement and its close reliance on the
successful establishment of the CCRIF, overall project financial management risk is high. The
riskassessment could be updated once project implementation is underway.

Flow of funds

8. Transfer of the project funds will be done via four direct payments made at the request of the
MEF from the World Bank account to the Facility account, which will be opened in a
commercial bank acceptableto the World Bank. Payments will be made annually by the 31st of
March.

Audit

9. Since the project funds will not travel through Haiti's accounts, annual audits are not
required of it. Instead, the Facility will be subject to an annual audit by auditors acceptable to
the Bank. The audit costs will be coveredby the CCRIF Trust Fund.

10. The auditors' terms of reference (TORs) will be cleared by the World Bank before
engagement of the auditor. The TORs will include the audit of financial transactions and a
review of the internal control mechanisms, and any other required audits and/or assessments.
The annual audit reports will be prepared in a format in accordance with International Standards
on Auditing and World Bank guidelines, and they will include an opinion on the project financial
statements, review of internal controls, a management letter, and any other required opinions.
The Facility annual audit report will be required to be submitted to the World Bank for review no
later than four months following the end of its fiscal year.

   (CCRIF or Facility)).     Due to the particular nature of the project, procurement of the
   insurancewill be through direct contracting.

2. Procurementof Works: No works are included inthis project.

3. Procurement of Goods: No goods are included inthis project.

4. Procurement of non-consultingservices: The only contracts that will be financed by the
   Grant will be the Participation Agreements and the Insurance Agreements between the
   Government and the CCRIF for the provision of insurance services by the CCRIF. The
   selection of the CCRIF to provide the insurance coverage will be made on a single-source
   basis using a modified version of the direct contracting method prescribed by the Bank's
   Procurement Guidelines. This direct contracting of the CCRIF is justified on the grounds
   that the CCRIF is the only source of the specific insurance coverage that the grant i s intended
   to finance.

                           Annex 9. Economic and Financial Analysis
                          HAITI: Haiti Catastrophe Insurance Project

1. While no empirical data are maintained that quantify the relationship between ex ante risk
   financing instruments, such as catastrophe insurance, and reduced impact of disaster losses
   on a country's vulnerability, previous international experience tends to confirm that ex ante
   risk financing arrangements are more effective than post-disaster mechanisms to finance
   immediate liquidity needs, because payments are based on pre-defined rules and are usually
   quickly disbursed inthe aftermath of a disaster.

2. Given Haiti's limited fiscal flexibility, particularly in the aftermath of a disaster, the
   Government is particularly vulnerable to these events, and thus, the benefits of catastrophe
   insurance are expected to be higher than the cost of insurance. Inother words, the social cost
   of catastrophic risk bearing is expected to be higher than the commercial premium, making
   them better off with catastrophe insurance than without.            Consequently, catastrophe
   insurance should generate, on average, a positive rate of return.

3. The financial benefits of the Caribbean Catastrophe Risk Insurance Facility (CCRIF or
   Facility) can be assessed through the reduction inthe estimated insurance premium compared
   to (a) the case where the Haitian Government would have to buy the same coverage
   individually; and (b) the case where the GoH should self-retain the catastrophic risks,
   because catastrophe insurance would not be not available on the market.

4. A simple but robust economic model is developed from the portfolio risk model to illustrate
   the benefits of purchasing catastrophe insurance offered from the CCRIF. Precise analysis is
   particularly difficult for catastrophe insurance where costs (that is, insurance premiums) are
   definitive while benefits (that is, insurance indemnity payouts) are at best, probabilistic.
   Hurricane insurance and earthquake insurance, when available, are assumed to be offered
   with a 30-year return period attachment point and a 200-year return period exhaustion point.
   The attachment point i s the minimum losses required to trigger a payout, while the
   exhaustion point i s the maximum payout the Government could receive. Table A.9.1 depicts
   the estimated insurance policy schedule for Haiti.

                           Table A.9.1. CCRIF Insurance Policy Schedule

           Earthquake insurance        25.5              120.5               4.8




5. The price of such a coverage offered by the CCRIF is estimated through a portfolio risk
   analysis coupled with a pricing model (see Background Document). It is compared with the
  hypothetical insurance price if it were offered individually by direct insurers. It i s
  noteworthy that such catastrophe insurance coverage i s currently not available for Haiti.


                                                29

    Hypothetical individual insurance premiums for Haiti are derived through a basic pricing
    equation based on the estimated annual average loss, the 200-year probable maximum loss
    and the opportunity cost of capital (set at 12 percent). Details are provided in the CCRIF
    Background Document.

6. The estimated CCRIF insurance premium i s also compared with the cost of self-retention if
    Haiti had to retain this risk (because insurance markets were not available) through reserves.
    Should the GoH be risk neutral, the cost of self-retention would be estimated through the
    annual average loss over a long time period. This assumption i s consistent with the Arrow-
    Lind Public Investment Theorem (Arrow and Lind 1970),12 which states that governments
    should be risk neutral toward natural disasters. They should not invest in any risk financing
    strategies that are more expensive than the expected losses caused by a natural disaster. This
    theory is in fact implemented by a number of large developed countries that rely on post-
    disaster financing (including budget reallocation and tax increases) to finance catastrophic
    losses. However, this theory fails in the case of small and highly indebted countries like
    Haiti, because the Government can spread the risk neither across space (geographic spread)
    nor across time (inter-temporal spread). Therefore, the cost of self-retention is assumed to be
    equal to the annual average loss plus the opportunity cost of reserves. The opportunity cost
    of reserve i s equal to the amount of reserves necessary to survive a 1-in-200-year event,
    multiplied by the marginal opportunity cost of capital (set at 12percent).

7. The cost of CCRIF insurance is compared with the cost of individual insurance (that is, if the
    country had purchased insurance individually) and the cost of self-retention.                      CCRIF
    hurricane insurance is estimated to be approximately 50 percent less expensive than
    individual hurricane insurance, and approximately 60 percent less expensive than the cost of
    country's self-retention (see Table A.9.2).            CCRIF earthquake insurance for Haiti is
    estimated to be 43 percent cheaper than individual earthquake insurance and 50 percent less
    expensive than self-retention. This i s a direct consequence of risk diversification.

                         HAITI: Haiti CatastropheInsurance Project

Project Objectives

1. The development objective of the project is to reduce the Government of Haiti's financial
   vulnerability to natural disasters by providing insurance coverage against earthquakes and
   hurricanes. This will be achieved through the establishment of the Caribbean Catastrophe
   Risk Insurance Facility (CCRIF or Facility) and the financing of catastrophe insurance
   coverage from the Facility.

2. The project aims to allow Haiti to join the CCRIF and benefit from financial protection
   against catastrophic earthquake and/or hurricane events. Without this grant, it is unlikely
   Haiti would join this pilot initiative that represents the first entity created to protect small
   island states from the financial impact of natural disasters.

3. The key intermediate indicators for the project are:

      0  The claim paying capacity of the CCRIF;
      0  The level of catastrophe insurance coverage providedto Haiti.

Project Description

   The proposed project aims to provide Haiti with insurance coverage against natural disasters
   (earthquakes and hurricanes). The project will finance the entrance fee and the annual
   insurance premiums (for three years) necessary to participate in the CCRIF. The coverage
   provided would help the Government of Haiti face immediate liquidity needs emerging from
   the occurrence of a disaster.

   The IDA Grant will be provided in four installments issued to CCRIF at the request of the
   Ministry of Economy and Finance (MEF). The grant will be withdrawn by the MEF for
   direct payment into the Facility. The project will include the following two components: (a)
   payment of entrance fee, (b) payment of annual insurance premiumfor the first three years.

Component 1: Payment of the entrance fee to the CCRIF (US$2.57million)

6. The objective of this component is to assist Haiti to join the CCRIF through the financing of
   the entrance fee. This fee i s equal to the first year's insurance premiumof US$2.57 million.

Component 2: Payment of annual insurance premium(US$6.43million)

7. The objective of this component is to assist Haiti to purchase the catastrophe insurance
   coverage offered by the CCRIF duringthe first three years.

8. Soon after its establishment in March 2007, the Facility will collect the entrance fee and first
   year premium.

Summary of Key Safeguard Issues
1. Describe any safeguard issues and impacts associatedwith the proposed project. Identify and
describe any potential large-scale, significant, and/or irreversible impacts:

NIA

2. Describe any potential indirect and/or long-term impacts due to anticipated future activities in
the project area:

Positive indirect impacts of the project include the improved ability of the Government to meet
the needs of their most vulnerable citizens in the immediate aftermath of a catastrophic event.
An immediate infusion of capital will enable government to jumpstart recovery efforts quickly
while not disrupting the budget appropriation process.

3. Describe any project alternatives considered to help avoid or minimize adverse impacts:

The project will have no adverse environmental or social impacts. Therefore, it was not
necessary to consider alternatives that would help avoid or minimize adverse impacts.

4. Describe measures taken by the recipient to address safeguard policy issues. Provide an
assessment of borrower capacity to plan and implement the measures described.

While no safeguards are triggered under the project, a project i s currently being developed to

emergency legislation will strengthen CARICOM government's capacity to disburse funds
efficiently. The project will assess current legal frameworks in the Caribbean with a goal of
improving the legislative and administrative framework triggered in a state of emergency. To
revise the institutional framework, current laws and administrative procedures will be studied to
identify areas for improvement.         Global best practice will then be considered and
recommendations made that are most suitedto the Caribbeanregion and to Haiti inparticular.

                         HAITI: HaitiCatastropheInsuranceProject

1. The proposed Caribbean Catastrophe Risk Insurance Facility (CCRIF) will be established as
   an independent entity to act as a financial intermediary between participating countries and
   the international financial markets (see Figure A.11.1). The Facility will serve as a risk
   aggregator by enabling participating governments to pool country-specific risks into one,
   better-diversified, portfolio. To access the reinsurance market where it is most efficient, the
   Facility must retain some of the risk ceded by participating countries. Therefore, a minimum
   level of reserves will need to be provided by donor partners to protect the Facility against the
   risk it retains.

2. The CCRIF is designed to provide countries in the Caribbean region with the opportunity to
   obtain access to catastrophe insurance at the lowest possible cost. Five main features of the
   proposed Facility support this goal.

Poolingof Risk

3. The pooling concept makes the overall risk more stable and therefore more attractive to the
  reinsurance market, thereby reducing the cost of reinsurance. Since natural disaster risks
   among the Caribbean islands are not perfectly correlated, the variability o f the CCRIF
   insurance portfolio is less than the combined variability of individual states. Risk assessment
  analyses demonstrate that the correlation between government losses caused b y catastrophic
  events varies from zero to 88 percent for hurricanes and from zero to 79 percent for
  earthquakes. The coefficient of variation, defined as the ratio between the standard deviation
  and the expected loss, i s nearly reduced by a factor of 3 when country losses are aggregated
   inahypothetical pool. Likewise, the Probable MaximumLoss (PML), defined as the largest



                                                 34

    likely loss from a specific catastrophic event for a given return period, i s significantly
    reduced when the risks are combined.

4. This implies that the cost of coverage is less, and the amount of capital (per policy) to be set
    aside (also called catastrophe load) i s lower, when country-specific risks are pooled into the
    Facility. Because the catastrophe load (see Box A.l.l) is one of the main drivers of the cost
    of coverage, initial financial simulations show that pooling country-specific catastrophic
    risks enables the Facility to reduce the country insurance premiumby almost half, compared
    with the cost of coverage a country would pay if it had to approach the reinsurance market
    independently.

5. The benefits of risk pooling are illustrated in Figure A.11.2. The probable maximum loss
    (PML)-for       a 1-in-200-year event-of         the Facility's insurance portfolio including all
    CARICOM countries i s compared to the sum of the country-specific PMLsI3.The amount of
    reserves is reduced by 65 percent for earthquakes and 75 percent for hurricanes. This means
    that, once country-specific catastrophe risks are pooled in the Facility, the risk capital (per
    policy) is reducedby more than 60 percent.

6. The benefits of risk pooling are further investigated by analyzing the impact of the number of
    participating countries on the level of reserves needed to survive a 1-in-200-year hurricane
    event. Figure A.11.3 shows how the participation of each additional Caribbean country
    affects the level of risk capital of the F a ~ i l i t y . 'The risk capital of the CCRIF is only 35
                                                                ~
    percent of the aggregate country risk capital (that is, 65 percent reduction) when 7 countries
    participate in the Facility. It can be further reduced to 75 percent if the CCRIF portfolio
    insurance includes 17 Caribbean countries.



l3Insurance policies display a 1-in-25-year attachment point, a 1-in-100-year exhaustion point, and a 10 percent
cedingpercentage.
l4The order of inclusion of the Caribbean countries in the CCRE portfolio affects the PML and thus the risk-
pooling benefit. A robust approach would havebeen to compute all possible combinations and then average them.
However, given the huge number of possible combinations, only a random set of combinations was computed and
averaged.

Box A.ll.l. How Catastrophe Insurance Works

The role of insurance is to serve as a recipient of risks and to diversify them by pooling losses among
many policyholders. The statistical foundation of insurance is the Law of Large Numbers. Intuitively,
the observed average loss (per policy) gets closer to the statistical expected loss (per policy) as the size of
the insured population increases. In other words, an insurer can almost predict the average loss (per
policy) and thus charge the policyholder accordingly. This result is valid when a large number of small
independent risks are at stake, such as inthe case of automobile insurance.

Unfortunately, contrary to automobile risks, the risks of natural disasters such as earthquakes and
hurricanes are not easily diversifiable because many policyholders are affected at the same time.
Moreover, deviations in the actual insurance loss from the expected insurance loss are very large. As a
result, in the case of catastrophic events, insurers have to set up risk capital provisions that will allow
them to disburse large indemnity payouts after significant events. These provisions generate substantial
costs to the insurer and are passed to the policyholder through a catastrophe load to be added to the
actuarial cost (that is, the expected annual loss). The higher the capital reserves and/or the opportunity
cost of capital, the higher the catastropheload.

The amount charged over and above the actuarial price is to compensate commercial providers for the
cost of providing the coverage, which includes operating cost, commissions, cost of risk capital, and
expected profit. For low-frequency risks, say, 1 in 100 years, the market can charge over four times the
actuarial cost. As a comparison, for more frequent risks(sa        in7 years), the multiple is lessthan twice
the expect         . The clear implication is that the capital requiredto be held on hand for low-frequency
risksmust          positive return, which is accomplished through charging relatively higher premiums.


Strong ReserveBase

7. The CCRIF would not be expected to pay dividends over time (although it will make profit to
    increase its reserves), considerably reducing the cost o f capital on the portion of the risk that
    it retains.     Consequently, the catastrophe load for that part of the premium paid by
    participating countries i s significantly reduced. For example, with US$40 million initial


                                                      36

   reserves, the Facility would be able to reduce the insurance premiums of a pool of eight
   countries by more than 40 percent (on average) compared to individual catastrophe
   insurance, and to grow its reserves by US$2.5 million a year on average. This effect is
   expected to increase over time and will depend on the level of initial reserves gathered at the
   launch of the Facility. With sufficient risk capital, the Facility will be able to dedicate a
   decreasing share of the premium collected to the purchase of reinsurance and a larger share
   to growing its reserves, thereby reducing the Facility's dependence on the reinsurance
   market. On the other hand, insufficient initial reserves will make it very difficult for the
   Facility to grow its reserves base and eventually become a sustainable venture.l5

8. Figure A.11.4 shows the estimated technical rate-on-line (technical insurance premium over
   coverage amount) of hurricane insurance for a hypothetical portfolio of eight countries, with
   different levels of initial reserves. An increase of initial reserves from US$20 million to
   US$40 million would allow the Facility to further reduce the cost of insurance by more than
    11 percent on average. This price reduction could be more than 50 percent if the initial
   reserves go up to US$SO million.

Note: The rate-on-line is defined as the cost of insurance expressed as a percentage of the coverage.

Low OperatingCosts

9. Design costs for the Facility are being funded by the World Bank through a grant from the
   Government of Japan. Without the benefit of this grant, the Facility would have had to
   charge higher insurance premium rates to recover its startup costs. Once the Facility has
   been established, the nature of the insurance instrument that the Facility will provide should
   help keep costs to a minimum; parametric insurance requires neither a costly monitoring
   process nor a loss adjustment process. The parametric approach depends exclusively on the
   measurable characteristics of a catastrophic event, or underlying index, as measured by
   independent agencies. Finally, participating countries will benefit from economies of scale

    inthe day-to-day operationof the facility, which should not exceed 5 percent of the premium
    collected. l6

Stability of Premiums

10.Buyers of insurance dislike fluctuating premiums since they usually experience them
    immediately after they have experienced a loss. As a result of the 2005 hurricanes, high
    pricing volatility currently presents a significant challenge for Caribbean countries' access to
    the reinsurance market. Currently, US.catastrophe prices, which can be used as a proxy for
    the Caribbean catastrophe insurance prices, are at a multiyear high (see Figure A11.5). One
    of the objectives of the CCRIF is to stabilize costs over time.

                       Figure A.11.5. U.S. Catastrophe Reinsurance Price Indexes




11.Prices of catastrophe insurance securitizations, as a percentage of the expected loss, fell from
    520 percent in March 2002 to 211 percent in March 2005 and increased to 297 percent in
    March 2006. Catastrophe prices are so volatile because, when extremely large losses occur,
    capital i s drained from the system and new capital becomes scarce. The market is then left
    with the only other mechanism for generating reserves quick1y-premium                        increases. When
    reserves are built up, capital is plentiful and premiumstend to drift lower.

12. Catastrophe insurance pools can act as efficient intermediaries between the ultimate
    consumers and reinsurance markets. If sufficient reserves are accumulated, the pool can
    smooth the cost of risk transfer, and thus the insurance premiums, by varying the level of
    local risk retention. As its capital base of reserves grows, the Facility will be able to retain
    more of the risk and provide greater stability to participating countries than the commercial
    market.

Continuity of Coverage

13. The basis for the financial strategy of the Facility i s different from the usual requirements of
    a commercial insurance company. Instead of profitability and balance-sheet-drivencriteria,
    the CCRIF aims to achieve a high level of survivability while maximizing long-term
    sustainability. To do so, it will needto determine a level of financial security that allows it to
    grow its capital, while providing sufficient assurance to policyholders that claims can be paid
    with certainty in any given year. (See Box A.11.2 for a discussion on Credit Ratings of
    Commercial Reinsures.)

                        tings of CommercialReinsurers

                          ncies place on corporations can in part be interpreted as an assessment of how
long an entity is expectedto be around. For example, an AAA-ratedcorporationis expected to survive in
the very long term. In contrast, a rating of CCC indicates that there is a significant chance that the
corporation may not survive the decade. Typically, commercial insurers and reinsurers set reserves to
have enough capital to ensure survival of a 1-in-100-yearevent or, more recently, a l-in-250-yearevent.
Inthe commercial market, reinsurancebuyerstendto buy protectionfromcompaniesratedBBBor better
andmost available reinsuranceis at the A-ratedlevel.

14. The main tradeoff faced by the Facility's risk manager (the Facility Supervisor) is the
    opposing needs of capital accumulation and survivability. A strategy through which the
   Facility would transfer most of its risk portfolio to the reinsurance marker would ensure a
    very high survivability but compromise its chance to accumulate reserves over time. On the
   other hand, a strategy through which the Facility would retain a larger part of the risk may
   jeopardize it survivability inany given year.

15. The speed at which reserves are accumulated and the level of survivability of the Facility
   would also affect the affordability of insurance coverage provided.                  The California
   EarthquakeAuthority, for example, is among the safest insurance programs inthe world, but
   also one of the most expensive, because it maintains enough claims-paying capacity to
   survive a 1-in-800-year-event. This risk management target i s considerably higher than the
    1-in-200-year event typically usedby BBB-rated private reinsurers. The Turkish Catastrophe
   InsurancePool has, six years after its establishment, a claims-paying capacity that enables it
   to absorb a 1-in-200-year event.

16.The risk financing strategy of the CCRIF is being developed with the help of a Dynamic
   Financial Analysis (DFA) model developed as part of the preparation work for the CCRIF
   (see Box A.11.3). This model allows the Facility's risk manager (the Facility Supervisor) to
   optimize the use of risk capital and traditional or nontraditional risk transfer instruments. It
   i s anticipated that the Facility will initially develop a financial strategy that generates a
   claims-paying capacity for surviving at least a l-in-150-year event, and seek to reach enough
   claims-paying capacity for surviving a l-in-250-year event over the next five years.

Box A.11.3. Dynamic Financial Analysis

A Dynamic Financial Analysis (DFA) model has beendeveloped as part of the preparation work for the
Facility to assist the CCRIF team in designing a financial strategy that balances the need for reinsurance
and growth of the reservepool. DFA is a financial tool for the insurance industry to better understandthe
effects of risk, and particularly catastrophic risk, on its operational account. This model aims to assist the
Facility in planning and executing a risk transfer and financing strategy that optimizes the use of risk
capital and traditional andnontraditionalrisktransfer instruments, including reinsurance.

TurkishCatastropheInsurancePool
With approximately 95 percent of the country's territory prone to earthquakes and a majority of
the population living in these areas, the persistent potential for large-scale natural disasters has
become a real concern for the Turkish Government, which ultimately led to the establishment of
the Turkish Catastrophe Insurance Pool (TCIP). Among the main rationales for the creation of
TCIP were a grave government fiscal exposure to natural disasters and a disproportionately low
level of catastrophe insurance penetration for such a disaster-prone country.            TCIP was
established as a public sector insurance entity providing catastrophe risk insurance for Turkish
homeowners. The role of the Government in the program is limited to providing additional
liquidity support in excess of TCIP's overall claims-paying capacity-a       scenario equivalent to
occurrence of an earthquake in Istanbulwith a 200-year return period.

TCIP commenced operations in September 2000 in the aftermath of yet another devastating
earthquake, the 1999 Marmara earthquake. The principal objectives of the TCIP are (a) to
provide earthquake insurance coverage at affordable but actuarially sound rates for all registered
dwellings through improved risk domestically and globally, (b) to limit the government's
financial exposure to natural disasters, (c) to build long-term catastrophe reserves to finance
future earthquake losses, and (d) to encourage risk reduction and mitigation practices in
residential construction.

Since the commencement of the program, the insurance penetration for catastrophe coverage has
more than tripled.     Providing coverage to about 2 million of the Turkish homeowners
(corresponding to 16 percent of insurable housing stock), today TCIP i s by far the largest
insurance program in the country. The insurance penetration achieved by the program in
Istanbul, however, is much higher-about    30 percent. Inonly four years the program managed
to build around US$l50 million in own reserves and secure close to a US$1 billion in total
claims-paying capacity, with most of it coming from the international reinsurance market at
rather competitive terms. In addition, since its first reinsurance placement, the program has
managed to achieve a 35 percent reduction in its reinsurance rates, despite the hardening
reinsurance market.

MongoliaLivestockInsuranceIndemnityPool
The Mongolian countryside remains a herder-based economy. Agriculture contributes nearly
one-third of the GDP and herding accounts for over 80 percent of agriculture. Shocks to the
well-being of animals have devastating implications for the rural poor and for the overall
Mongolian economy. Major shocks are common because Mongolia is a harsh climate where
animals are herded with limited shelter. Through financing from the World Bank and other
donors, the Government of Mongolia launched the Index-Based Livestock Insurance Project
(IBLIP) in mid-2005 to further safeguard the livelihoods of herders and the overall viability of
this important subsector of the economy, while limitingthe fiscal exposure of the Government.




                                                43

The IBLIP includes the establishment of a syndicate-pooling arrangement for insurance
companies-the     Livestock Insurance Indemnity Pool (LIIP). Herder premiums are deposited
into the LIIP until the settlement period.       Thus, indemnities are fully protected under this
scheme. The LIIP ring fences this line of business and thus protects the domestic insurance
market against any financial contagion caused by extreme livestock losses, because the
Government of Mongolia fully covers insured losses beyond the financial capacity of the pool
through an unlimited stop-loss reinsurance treaty, backed by a US$5 million World Bank
contingent loan. The LIIP commenced operation in 2005 in selected pilot areas. Although
livestock insurance i s offered on a voluntary basis, about 10 percent of herders bought this
insurance coverage duringthe first sales season.

MexicanCatastropheBond

InMay 2006, Mexico issuedUSD160 million of (binary) catastrophe bonds to cover against the
risk of earthquakes.    The Mexican earthquake bond, which has been sold to institutional
investors in the United States and Europe, acts like an insurance policy for the Mexican
government. Investors are paying US$160 million into a Special Purpose Vehicle (SPV), CAT-
Mex Ltd, created b y Swiss Re for the Mexican government; if an earthquake of moment
magnitude 7.5 or 8 hits regions near Mexico City or along the Pacific coast within the next three
years, the Government will get a payout. If an earthquake occurs, the Mexican Government can
use the funds to finance emergency expenditures. If there i s no earthquake, the money would be
returned to the investors. This is the first time a sovereign country has issued a catastrophe bond.
The US$160 million catastrophe bond is part of a U S 4 5 0 million risk transfer that also includes
US$290 million reinsurance.

GlobalIndexReinsuranceFacility
An InternationalFinance Corporation (IFC)/World Bankjoint project involves the incorporation
of a specialist index-based reinsurer, with the IFC as a 25 percent shareholder and an
international reinsurer as a 50 percent shareholder. The Global Indexed Reinsurance Facility
(GIRF) will, in conjunction with the private sector partner and other International Financial
Institutions (IFI) investors, establish a special purpose reinsurance company (Index Re),
nominally capitalized at $100 million, which will be dedicated to structuring, underwriting, and
intermediating index-based (parametric) insurance relating to catastrophe and weather risks in
developing countries. We expect this facility to benefit from the allocation of Euro 25 million
from the European Unionto support the creation of the facility and to subsidize premiums, which
will be calculated on a market basis, for suitable customers.

The project needs World Bank (WB) support at several levels: to maintain support from the
private sector partner, to promote the concept with WB regional and country staff, to help
persuade governments of the value of index-based cover, and to help source and structure deals.
The inclusion of a partnership with a private sector specialist reinsurer was central to the concept
presentedby the World Bank when it sought expressions of interest from the private sector in
late 2005.
