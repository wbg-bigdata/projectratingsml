INTERNATIONAL BANK FOR RECONSTRUCTION AND DEVELOPMENT
REPORT AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT
TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS ON TWO
PROPOSED LOANS TO THE INSTITUTO COSTARRICENSE DE ELECTRICIDAD
FOR A FOURTH POWER AND A THIRD TELECOMMUNICATIONS PROJECT
WITH THE GUARANTEE OF COSTA RICA
1.        I submit the following report and recommendations on two proposed
loans to Instituto Costarricense de Electricidad (ICE) with the guarantee
of the Republic of Costa Rica for the equivalent of $6.5 million for a power
project and $17.5 million for a telecommunications project, to help finance
the foreign exchange cost of the next stage of ICE's development program.
The two loans would each have a term of 20 years, including grace periods
of 4-1/2 years for power and 5-1/2 years for telecommunications, with inter-
est at 7-1/4 percent per annum.
PART I - INTRODUCTION
2.        Costa Rica has to date received eleven Bank loans and one IDA
credit totalling $89.5 million. Four loans, amounting to $49.3 million,
have been made for power and telecommunications, two loans and one credit,
amounting to $25.8 million, for transportation and five loans, totalling
$14.4 million, for agricultural and industrial development. The last loan,
for roads, was signed in April 1970. In addition to the proposed loans,
the lending program for FY1972 includes a loan of about $9 million for
agriculture.
3.        As of December 31, 1971, a total of $22.5 million remained to be
disbursed on four ongoing projects (in agriculture, power, telecommunications
and roads). The agricultural project (Loan 538-CR) had a very slow start
mainly because funds for agricultural credit were available from other ex-
ternal sources and the organization of the project unit was weak. This sit-
uation changed in late 1970, and the loan was fully committed by August 31,
1971. The undisbursed balance, which on December 31, 1971, was $1.2 million,
is expected to be fully disbursed by June 1972, about twelve months later
than initially estimated. The third power project (Loan 631-CR) is about
24 months behind schedule, and cost estimates have been increased by about
40 percent due to severe tunnelling problems and late delivery of equipment.
Consultants are now advising on the tunnelling difficulties and the project
is under close supervision. In the case of the highway project (Loan 664-CR),
the Government has requested supplementary financing to cover a large cost
increase in the construction of the highway, which was initiated about six
months ago. A mission will leave shortly to review this request. A summary
statement of Bank loans/ IDA credits is in Annex 1.

ing concrete products (Productos de Concreto S/A). This has been repaid.
PART II - THE ECONOMY
5.        During the past decade Costa Rica's development has been impres-
sive. An annual average increase of real GDP of 6 percent, coupled with a
reduction in the annual rate of population growth from almost 4 percent to
around 3 percent, resulted in a notable increase of per capita GDP (at 1969
prices) from $390 in 1960 to over $520 in 1970. Costa Rica has reached a
rarely found level of social cohesion and democratic political institutions.
The absence of a standing army resulted in minimal defense expenditures and
permitted the public sector to devote increasing amounts of the country's
resources to development purposes. The Government has tried to achieve a
fair distribution of the benefits of development through education, health
and other social programs. Today almost nine-tenths of the population over
ten years of age are literate, and the mortality rate is one of the lowest
in the Hemisphere.
6.        This commendable long-term development performance, however, has
been accompanied by recurrent financial difficulties. Central Government
expenditures have risen rapidly to provide a high level of social services
to a rapidly growing population. At the same time the fiscal revenue base,
strongly dependent on foreign trade taxes, was weakened during the 1960s by
the elimination of duties within the Central American Common Market (CACM).
Furthermore, overly generous fiscal incentives were granted to stimulate
industrial development within the market, and offsetting changes in the fis-
cal revenue structure proved to be difficult to introduce. Thus, additional
taxation of domestic transactions has persistently lagged behind needs. The
result has been a chronic fiscal deficit, financed first by short-term bor-
rowing abroad and later by large domestic credit expansion. Demand pressures
resulting from rapid growth and Central Bank financing of fiscal deficits
have inflated import expenditures, and it has only been during periods of
exceptional export growth that rapid development and balance of payments
equilibrium have been simultaneously achieved. By the end of 1966 the de-
terioration of the fiscal and balance of payments accounts reached a criti-
cal level. Net international reserves became negative by some $14 million
and debt service absorbed over 18 percent of export earnings, due to heavy
medium-term borrowing for fiscal purposes. This resulted in a marked slow-
down of new commitments by the Bank and other external lending agencies,
pending an improvement in the Government's economic policies.
7.        During 1967-1969 a marked financial improvement took place, mainly
as a result of buoyant exports, but reflecting also the more adequate govern-
ment policies. Restrained credit expansion and the introduction of a dual
exchange system combined with rapidly growing banana and industrial exports



-3-
to achieve a considerable improvement in the fiscal and balance of payments
situation. Fiscal deficits were drastically reduced, and public savings in-
creased from 0.7 to 3.5 percent of GDP between 1968 and 1970. Although net
foreign financing became negative, goverrment investment increased by over
10 percent per year, financed largely domestically through placement of bonds
with the private sector. Net international reserves recovered and by the end
of 1969 reached a level of $38 million, equivalent to almost six weeks of
imports.
8.        Nevertheless, during the second half of 1970 and in 1971, following
the quadrennial change of government, serious financial problems once again
aggravated Costa Rica's internal and external situation. During 1970, al-
though exports grew healthily by 20 percent, imports rose by over 30 percent.
This high import growth was due to the return to the old exchange parity at
the end of 1969 - resulting in an effective revaluation -,to speculative
buying in anticipation of the expected imposition of a 30 percent import
surcharge, and to a drastic relaxation of credit policies. As a result, net
international reserves fell $12 million to $26 million, equivalent to four
weeks of imports. During 1971 the balance of payments situation deteriorated
further as prices and value of coffee exports fell heavily. An accumulating
fiscal deficit and a large expansion in banking system credit to the private
sector, financed mainly by Central Bank rediscounting, fueled a level of
aggregate demand inconsistent with the import and production possibilities
of the economy. By the end of May 1971 net international reserves had de-
creased to $23.3 million, instead of recording the normal seasonal increase,
and on June 18 the Central Bank reintroduced the dual exchange system and
imposed surcharges on non-essential imports. However, continued credit ex-
pansion and inadequate management of foreign exchange transactions allowed
imports to keep growing at over 10 percent on an annual basis, while exports
stagnated. Although by the end of 1971, net international reserves had in-
creased to approximately $37.6 million, $16 million had to be borrowed
abroad, and a large amount of import payment arrears had also accumulated.
Furthermore, recent movement of prices also show the relative short term
inelasticity of domestic production to an excessive increase in aggregate
demand. The wholesale price index, which rose annually by around 3.9 per-
cent in the 1966-69 period, increased 6.5 percent in 1970 and 5.5 percent
in the first seven months of 1971.
9.        The rate of real GDP growth slowed down to around 5.4 percent in
1970, and probably about 3-4 percent in 1971. Although industry and commerce
continued to expand briskly in 1970, a bad farm year, mainly due to adverse
weather conditions, contributed to the slower rise in output. No national
accounts data are yet available for 1971, but some indicators in the indus-
trial and commercial sector, together with the stagnation of exports, point
to a slowdown in economic growth. Agriculture, however, has recovered
slightly and public investment and construction have been dynamic factors.



- 4 -
10.       The Bank, in consultation with the International Monetary Fund,
has kept a close watch on economic developments in Costa Rica during the
past eighteen months, and a series of discussions has taken place with the
Costa Rican authorities on measures needed to re-establish internal and ex-
ternal financial stability.
11.       The Costa Rican authorities have prepared an emergency stabiliza-
tion program for 1972. The program is directed to curtail aggregate demand
and hence imports, mainly through a more realistic monetary program and
through additional taxes. Its main features are as follows:
(i) A monetary and credit program for 1972, approved by the
Central Bank's Board of Directors in late December 1971,
which is designed to reduce liquidity and curtail aggre-
gate demand. Accordingly, credit ceilings have been im-
posed on individual banks, and total expansion of banking
system assets for 1972 will be limited to less than 7 per-
cent, down from around 28 percent in 1971. Excess liquid-
ity in the economy will be absorbed through open market
operations and a reduction of import payment arrears.
(ii) A fiscal package, which is based on increasing taxes and
containing expenditure growth. It includes a tax reform
aimed at raising fiscal revenues and controlling import
growth mainly through increased consumption and income
taxes, and taxation of remittances abroad. The reform is
expected to yield around 0100-120 million, equivalent to
almost 2 percent of GDP. On January 14 the Congressional
Fiscal Commission approved the tax measures, which are now
being discussed by the Assembly. In addition, expenditure
increases over and above the approved ordinary budget will
be held back in order to ensure a manageable deficit in
1972.
(iii) Modification of the foreign exchange regulations, simpli-
fying the multiple exchange rate system. Import sur-
charges will be eliminated and additional import trans-
actions are to be transferred from the official rate
(06.65) to the more depreciated free rate. The objective
is to be able to cope with foreign exchange demand with-
out further accumulating arrears.
(iv) On the basis of the above fiscal and monetary guidelines,
the Costa Rican authorities have started negotiations for
a stabilization credit from the Central American Stabiliza-
tion Fund recently established by the five members of the
CACM, and have indicated their intention to seek a stand-
by arrangement with the IMF.   The higher liquidity of re-
serves resulting from drawings on the proposed credits
would allow the authorities to reduce and eventually eli-
minate the existing payment arrears.



- 5 -
12.       Medium and long term development prospects are good for Costa Rica,
although the rate of economic growth in 1972 is likely to be reduced to 3 or
4 percent in real terms because of the problems which the country's tradi-
tional exports are facing, together with the continued interruptions of trade
within the Common Market. In general, future policies will have to concen-
trate on expanding exports and diversifying the economy to reduce the recur-
rence of short-term fluctuations, with an increase in private and public sav-
ings to support investment and growth. Later in the decade, various new
exportable agricultural foodstuffs, forest products and bauxite have good
prospects for development. Also, if the Central American countries are suc-
cessful in re-structuring the CACM and inducing the growth of less protected
and more efficient local industries, Cost Rica's industry should be able to
compete successfully in broader markets. An educated labor force and a long
record of political stability are very positive factors from this point of
view.
13.       An inadequate transport system is still one of the major bottlenecks
to the expansion of the economy. Substantial investments are also needed in
power and telecommunications facilities if these are to keep pace with pro-
jected demand increases. Availability of power at low cost will be a major
element in the diversification of the economy and further development of in-
dustry.  Demand for adequate communication facilities in the larger cities
continues to grow rapidly, while interconnection between rural towns and
villages is still minimal and represents a serious handicap in rural devel-
opment. Flood control and irrigation are also basic elements for the suc-
cess of an agricultural diversification policy. The Bank's last economic
report estimated that, if the same overall growth rates as in the 1960's
were to be achieved in this decade, gross public external capital inflows
of $320 million would be required during 1971-76. These should be attaina-
ble without any major increase in the level of external public debt service
which at present absorbs around 13-14 percent of export earnings, so long as
Costa Rica can continue to rely on official aid for the bulk of the long-term
capital required.  The country's economic record justifies continued external
support of its development efforts provided that inflation is prevented from
getting out of hand.
14.       Apart from the World Bank, external financing is principally pro-
vided by USAID, the Interamerican Development Bank (IDB) and the Central
American Bank for Economic Integration (CABEI). AID has been active in
agricultural development, construction and maintenance of roads and health.
IDB is financing mainly agricultural and industrial credit, water supply,
housing, feeder roads, rural electrification and vocational education.
CABEI is financing projects with a regional impact, principally in trans-
port, industry and telecommunications. AID loans are for a term of 40 years
with interest of 2-3 percent and most IDB loans are extended from the Fund
for Special Operations, carrying 3-4 percent interest rates and terms rang-
ing from 15 to 30 years. The terms of CABEI loans -- which often provide



-6-
100 percent financing of local expenditures -- vary in accordance with the
ultimate source of financing, but generally contain a substantial conces-
sionary element. The past lending of the main official lending agencies
is summarized below.

15.       The World Bank's lending in Costa Rica over the past four years
has been directed in the main towards the strengthening of economic infra-
structure and the diversification of agriculture. In addition to the two
loans now proposed for power and telecommunications, a further loan of $9
million for a second agricultural credit is included in the program for
the current fiscal year. Operations under consideration for subsequent
years include further lending for power and highways and possibly an edu-
cation project. The Bank has agreed to act as an executing agency for an
UNDP-financed transport study of the metropolitan area of San Jose.
PART III - THE PROJECT
Sector Background
16.       Costa Rica's power and telecommunications systems are the most
developed in Central America. Per capita power consumption (506 KWh) and
installed capacity are the highest, and power rates the lowest, in the re-
gion. Telephone density has doubled over the last five years and is now
3.3 telephones per hundred of population, which is higher than the average
of the other Central American countries, though still well below the aver-
age in Western Europe. As in the past five years, the power and telecommuni-
cations sectors are expected to absorb about 17 percent and 9 percent res-
pectively of public sector investment during 1972-76.



17.       Sales of power in the interconnected system are expected to in-
crease at an average annual rate of 9.3 percent up to 1985. As a proportion
of total sales, sales for industry and commerce have increased rapidly from
36 percent in 1965 to 41 percent in 1971 and are expected to reach 53 percent
in 1985. The standby generating capacity and other facilities required to
support the expansion program would be provided under the proposed power
project.
18.       Out of the existing 39,000 connected telephone lines, a large
proportion is concentrated around the capital of San Jose, with little or
no service for rural areas. The proposed telecommunications project would
not only expand and improve telephone service in the capital and the provin-
cial cities, but also extend service to the outlying centers, providing basic
telephone and telegraph services to some 600 smaller towns and villages,
where public call offices would be established. Besides the social benefits
of reducing the isolation of these rural centers, there will also be impor-
tant non-quantifiable economic benefits from promoting the orderly marketing
of agricultural products, reducing travel time and fostering trade among the
rural centers themselves.
Project Entity
19.       ICE was established in 1949 as an autonomous agency of the Govern-
ment, to plan and carry out a coordinated program of electrification of the
country. In 1958 it was given by decree the additional responsibility of
providing telecommunications services in Costa Rica, but it was only in 1962
that ICE was given a permanent concession and actually began carrying out its
new responsibilities. In 1968 ICE acquired 92 percent of the shares of Com-
pania Nacional de Fuerza y Luz (CNFL), a private company which operated the
principal power distribution system in the country. ICE has a seven-member
Board of Directors, one of whom is a government member. The six non-govern-
ment members are appointed by the Government for eight-year staggered terms.
The general manager, appointed by the Board, is responsible for all manage-
rial and administrative functions.
20.       Both power and telecommunications operations are well run, although
their growth has brought about certain problems which need to be studied. The
proposed power loan would finance a management and organization study of ICE
by consultants, which would concentrate on three problem areas. First, ICE
is highly centralized and the study would explore the possibility of greater
delegation of authority and a clear distinction between management and policy
making functions. Second, ICE uses its own staff to construct power projects
and this has contributed to the difficulties under the third power project
(Loan 631-CR), indicated in paragraph 3. The consultants would review ICE's
policy with regard to construction. Third, the coupling of power and tele-
communications has been an effective method of establishing these new ser-
vices, but with continued expansion an orderly demarcation is becoming ne-
cessary. The technologies of power and telecommunications, as well as account-
ing requirements, are different, and supporting functions such as training and
marketing have also little in common. The consultants would make recommenda-
tions on how to achieve operational independence necessary for efficient fu-
ture development of power and telecommunications.



2-.       A review is also needed of the overall organization and regulation
of the power sector. At prt-sent there are 57 public utilities and 120 auto-
prodi,cers of energy most of wihich are small, poorly regulated and inefficient.
No national power sector prcgram exists, and this has led to some duplicatiwt
of facilities, lack of standardization and uneconomic tariffs. Although owned
by ICE, the principal power distribution company (CNFL) is operated as a se-
parate entity; a complete merger could perhaps result in a more efficient
-e n" -aragerial. and financia' resources.   T:ie functions of the regulatory
agercy (Sar%;lcio Nacional de E½ectricidad) should also be defined more pre-
cisely. The proposed power loan would therefore also finance a study by
consultants of the power secror.
Project Descriptions and Financing Plan
22.       A report entitled "Appraisal of Power and Telecommunications Proj-
e ts of the Instituto Costarricense de Electricidad (ICE), Costa Rica'
(No. PU-77a, dated Januarv 17, 1972) is available separately. The main
features of the loans and projects are summarized in Annex III.
23.       The projects were appraised in the field in May/June 1971.    Nego-
tiations of the proposed loans were held in Washington in December 1971.
ICE was represented by Messrs. Alex Murray, Vice President of the Board,
Mario Burgos, Mlember of the Board, Rodrigo Suarez, Manager, Antonio Canas,
Deputy Manager, Erwin Castro, Auditor, and Julio Cesar Mora, Lawyer. The
Government was represented by Mr. Claudio Alpizar, Minister of Finance, and
Servicio Nacional de Electricidad (the regulatory agency) by Mr. Fernando
Rojas, Manager.
24.       In power, the 1971-75 expansion program includes principally the
construction of generating facilities, for which financing will be sought
in late 1972, ongoing works financed by Bank Loan 631-CR and rural electri-
fication financed by an IDB loan, as well as the power project proposed for
Bank financing. The project comprises:
(a) installation of two gas turbines of about 15 MW each to help
meet peak demand in 1973 and serve as stand-by units to exist-
ing and future hydropower capacity;
(b) installation of a diesel power station of about 3 MW;
(c) construction of power transmission facilities; and
(d) retention of consultants for engineering studies and for
studies of the power sector and ICE's organization.
Total cost of the project is estimated at $8.3 million. The proposed loan
of $6.5 million would cover the foreign exchange cost of the project and
possibly a small amount of local costs (paragraph 30).



-9-
25.       In telecommunications, the development program to 1976 consists
of ongoing works in Stage II (1967-73) of ICE's long-term expansion plan,
which are being completed on schedule with the assistance of Bank Loan
632-CR, and new works in the overlapping Stage III (1972-76) of the plan,
which is the project proposed for Bank financing. The project consists of:
(a)  installation of about 25,000 exchange lines;
(b)  increase of trunk network capacity by about 1,000 circuits,
and extension of the main trunk exchange by about 1,000
lines;
(c)  establishment of public-call offices in about 600 rural
towns and villages;
(d)  expansion of telex facilities; and
(e)  employment of technical instructors and engineering consul-
tants.
Total cost of the project is estimated at $32.2 million. The proposed loan
of $17.5 million would cover the 'foreign exchange cost of the project and
possibly a small amount of local costs (paragraph 30).
26.       A satisfactory financing plan has been prepared by ICE for 1972-
76 totalling $138.1 million. About 40 percent of the funds required are
expected to be generated from within the enterprise, 17 percent from the
Bank loans now proposed, 10 percent from local bond issues, 7 percent from
already committed external loans, leaving 26 percent to be raised by future
borrowings for the next power project.
Financial Position of Borrower
27.       Over the past five years, ICE's gross fixed assets have increased at
an annual rate of 9 percent. About 85 percent of this growth was financed by
borrowing, and this heavy dependence on borrowing has given cause for concern.
ICE's financial performance, however, has improved substantially since the
previous Bank loans were made, in 1969. Net operating income grew at an annual
rate of over 30 percent between 1967 and 1970 with the introduction of realistic
tariffs and the rapid growth of telecommunications. ICE's finances are now
sound and are expected to continue to improve. Annual rates of return until
the end of the construction periods are projected to be over 11 percent on net
fixed assets in power, except for 1975 when the rate of return is expected to
decrease to 9.3 percent, and over 15 percent on net fixed assets in tele-
communications. ICE has agreed to earn minimum rates of return of 9 percent
for the power project and 12 percent for the telecommunications project, which
should ensure adequate cash generation for future investments.



- 10 -
28.       ICE's debt service coverage is projected to be satisfactory.   ICE
has, as under previous loans, agreed not to undertake any long-term debt
without the Bank's prior approval, unless net revenues would cover its debt
service at least 1.5 times.
Procurement
29.       Goods financed by the Bank would be procured through international
competitive bidding, with the exception of telecommunications equipment for
extending certain installations where direct compatibility is essential.
This equipment would be purchased from five suppliers with whom the original
contracts were placed as a result of international competitive bidding in
accordance with Bank procurement procedures. It is proposed that the Bank
should finance such equipment, estimated to cost $2.9 million.
30.       As in our previous loans to ICE (631 and 632-CR), the provisions
for international competitive bidding give recognition to existing arrange-
ments in the Central American Common Market by allowing a margin of prefer-
ence in bid valuation for bids submitted by manufacturers in all the Central
American countries.  These countries have entered into an Agreement on Fiscal
Incentives for Industrial Development in which each agrees to give preferen-
tial treatment (limited to 50 percent of existing external import duties) to
products of Central American origin in all public procurement. Provision is
made in the Loan Agreements that the preference so allowed shall not exceed
15 percent. The same margin of preference would apply to procurement in
Costa Rica. It is estimated that under these arrangements procurement of
telephone poles, small-size cables and PVC ducts in the Central American
countries for telecommunications might amount to $3.0 million equivalent,
including procurement in Costa Rica of up to some $1.5 million equivalent.
For power, purchases in Costa Rica of cement, reinforcing steel, fuel, tires
and welding rods may amount to $0.5 million equivalent, whereas no purchases
of any significance are expected from the other Central American countries.
If purchases take place in Costa Rica up to the amounts of $1.5 million
equivalent for telecommunications equipment and of $0.5 million equivalent
for power supplies, the amounts of local cost financing - after deducting
the foreign exchange component of local purchases - would be about $0.5 mil-
lion and $0.2 million respectively.
31.       In the case of the power project, bids have already been invited
for the gas turbine units and costs have been incurred for engineering
studies in order to meet the construction schedule. Up to $0.6 million
would be reimbursed to ICE from the proposed loan for expenditures incurred
from June 1, 1971.
Disbursement
32.       Both loans would be disbursed against 100 percent of the foreign
exchange costs of imported equipment, materials and consultant services, and
95 percent of the ex-factory cost of any items procured within Costa Rica,
representing their estimated cost net of taxes.



Economic Justification
33.       The two projects are technically sound and economically justified.
The internal financial rates of return of the power and telecommunications
projects are about 9 percent and 23 percent respectively, the rate of return
for the power project being calculated on the basis of the total investment
needed to meet the increase in demand during 1972-77. It is not possible
to calculate the return on the gas turbines alone, since they are designed
to serve as stand-by units. The economic returns would be higher. It is
estimated that without the power project the loss of production would range
between $20 and $50 million in the 1973-84 period. The telecommunications
project, besides satisfying the expected increase in demand in the main
cities, would connect an additional 600 rural towns and villages, substan-
tially contributing to rural development.
PART IV - LEGAL INSTRUMENTS AND AUTHORITY
34.       The draft Loan Agreements between the Bank and ICE, the draft
Guarantee Agreements between the Republic of Costa Rica and the Bank, the
Report of the Committee provided for in Article III, Section 4 (iii) of the
Articles of Agreement and the text of the Resolutions approving the proposed
loans are being distributed to the Executive Directors separately. The
draft agreements conform to the normal pattern for loans for power and tele-
communications projects.
35.       Consistent with the purpose of the negative pledge clause contained
in Section 5.03 of both draft Loan Agreements and given the Borrower's cur-
rent practice of securing some of its borrowings with mortgages and other
liens on its assets, Article VI of both draft Loan Agreements and Schedule
5 thereto provide for the creation of a mortgage and a floating chattel
mortgage on certain property of the Borrower to secure payment of the prin-
cipal, interest and other charges on the loans and the Bonds.
36.       I am satisfied that the proposed loans would comply with the Arti-
cles of Agreement of the Bank.
PART V - RECOMMENDATION
37.       I recommend that the Executive Directors approve the proposed
loans.
