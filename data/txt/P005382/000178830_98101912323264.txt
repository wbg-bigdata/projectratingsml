I. URBAN DEVELOPMENT IN MOROCCO AND RELATED
GOVERNMENT POLICIES AND PROGRAMS
1.01      Morocco is one of Africa's most urbanized nations.  Since the be-
ginning of this century the urban population has increased 15-fold; annual
urban population increases have averaged about 4.5% over the last ten years.
The country's 1977 population was 17.2 million, with 6.9 million in urban
areas. By the end of this century the urban population is expected to have
reached 20 million, representing about 60% of Morocco's total population.
The most serious problems facing the country's cities are housing shortage
and unemployment. In early 1977 the total housing stock in urban areas
comprised some 1.37 million units of which almost 25% were in slum-like
squatter settlements, and another 15% represented aged, deteriorated housing
beyond repair. Accounting for the many dwelling units occupied by two or
more households, and for housing upgrading requirements, current unsatisfied
urban housing demand is of the order of 810,000 dwelling units. This demand
will continue to increase by some 85,000 units annually. In 1976, about 50%
of urban households were without water connections, 30% without electricity,
and 45% without sanitary installations. Deteriorating utility networks and
inadequate community services pose another problem. Limited financial re-
sources and implementation capacities constrain attempts to mitigate these
problems. Many municipalities, because of lack of staff and the volume of
work required have ceased to exercise effective control over development of
their jurisdictions. Education and health care services, although they are
better on average in urban areas then in rural areas, remain inadequate.
Thirty percent of urban households have monthly incomes below the country's
absolute poverty level; between 20% and 25% of the labor force in urban areas
is estimated to have no regular income and might be broadly referred to as
the informal sector.
1.02      Since the beginning of this century Morocco has undergone an eco-
nomic transformation which resulted in substantial changes in the country's
population pattern. The central western and northwestern parts of the coun-
try, where most of the population, industry and modern agriculture are lo-
cated, have developed rapidly. Differences in natural factor endowment are
at the origin of this concentration, and the subsequent adjustment process
in spatial distribution of population to resources, activities and income.
Rapid urbanization is a salient feature of the spatial adjustment of popula-
tion. In the past, concentration of urban population took place in large
agglomerations, mainly along the Atlantic coast of the country's Northwest.
More recently, a new trend has emerged in which the growth rates of these
large cities were below the overall growth rate of the country's urban popu-
lation. Many mid-sized cities elsewhere in the country have experienced
fast population increases in response to local factors such as the growth of
production in modern agriculture, and the growth of industrial production and
administrative services. A transformation of most cities has taken place
under the ever increasing population pressure caused by rural in-migration
and natural population increase. This has resulted in population overflows
into haphazard shanty towns and other densely populated, poorly planned and
serviced districts which are now a permanent feature of Moroccan cities.



-4-
1.03      Government policies and program in urban development were not
always effective in dealing with urban problems. During the first years
of the French administration under the Protectorate a tradition was estab-
lished of government interest and action at the highest levels; nothing but
the best quality would do for the cities of Morocco. However, the momentum
of the early activism in urban development was not maintained, and from the
mid-1920s until the end of the Second World War central government interven-
tion in urban affairs was minimal. The war left two important legacies for
Morocco's cities; the first was the establishment of industries, the growth
of which has transformed the appearance, character and problems of many Mor-
occan cities. The second stems from the failure of government to cope with
the development of cities both before and during the war. After the war, the
administration addressed mounting urban problems through thoughtful planning
and vigorous policies. An urban planning legislation, still valid today, was
established. During the first decade after independence in 1956 the Govern-
ment of Morocco's (GOM's) attention was focussed away from the cities and
their development; it was also a period when resources were limited. Emphasis
was put on measures to stimulate the growth of a stagnant agricultural sector.
Rural development was first priority partly because the stagnation of the
agricultural sector was viewed as the principal impediment to national de-
velopment, but also because GOM hoped to check or at least to slow thereby
migration to the cities. This policy found expression in Morocco's develop-
ment plans between 1965 and 1972, but urban population continued to grow at
a rapid pace. In the late 1960s GOM reassessed policies toward urban develop-
ment. As a result, the 1973-1977 Development Plan provided for a sizeable
public housing program. Unfortunately, the Plan fell substantially short of
achieving its targets, especially in urban land development and housing. At
the end of the Plan period it is evident that only about 40% of the housing
construction target has been achieved. The reasons are primarily poor organi-
zation, inadequate staffing and insufficient Government budgets. Costly
design standards eroded budget provisions prematurely and rendered many hous-
ing schemes unaffordable by urban low income groups. Another reason for the
insufficiency of budget allocations for urban development was poor recovery
of investment, operating and maintenance costs of urban schemes and services
which necessitated substantial government subsidies. These subsidy require-
ments consumed much of the budget allocations for urban development. Resource
mobilization in the open market for financing urban development, especially
housing programs was very limited due to unattractively low interest rates.
Also, inadequate availability of public land required for urban extension,
and capacity constraints in the local construction and construction material
industry, had a negative impact on attempts to cope with urban problems.
1.04      GOM has now prepared the basis for the 1978-82 Development Plan.
This plan is proposed to include a considerable urban development program
which provides for upgrading the housing of about 500,000 urban low-income
families and for constructing more than 300,000 new urban housing units.
This program is guided by the basic concept of preserving and better utilizing



existing urban resources and reflects a remarkable reorientation in plan-
ning and technical approaches to urban development. Many technical concepts
have been introduced which aim at lowering the cost of housing construction
and urban infrastructure. But the proposed urban development program in
the 1978-82 Plan which addresses only some of the most pressing problems of
Morocco's cities requires funds which are enormous for the national budget.
It îs proposed to develop special financing mechanisms in tbte formi of revolv-
ing funds for urban land purchase and development, as well aE for low-coqt
housing construction. GOM realizes the need to improve recovery of urban
development costs to ensure successful operation of these revolving funds.
Also, the need for reforms in pricing for the provision and maintenance
urban services is widely accepted. The combined effect of reducing capital
requirements for urban development, and improved recovery of urban development
costs will establish affordability and replicability in time. But the adjust-
ment process will have to be gradual to ensure acceptability and to minimize
distortions in the country's urban sector. In the meantime the problems of
Morocco's cities will further aggravate causing extreme social hardship in
many urban areas. The Government will need substantial financial assistance
and continuous encouragement during this difficult transition period.
1.05      Organizational arrangements for urban development planning have
changed over time. Since the early 1970s GOM has tried to improve the in-
stitutional set-up for urban planning and administration. But the process
is slow and many inefficiencies continue to exist. Recognizing the need for
reforms of policies and procedures in the area of urban development, GOM
has initiated efforts to develop a new organizational framework for coping
with the problems of Morocco's cities. The decision to establish in 1973 a
Ministry of Urban Development, Housing, Tourism and Environment, was a sound
first step towards achieving a workable arrangement for a coordinated approach
to urban housing and land development. But the Ministry was plagued by short-
ages of qualified personnel and budget constraints, and was only inadequately
fulfilling its intended role in guiding urban development. As one of the
results of the September 1977 Government reshuffle, a new Ministry of Housing
and Regional Development has been established.  This Ministry is being organ-
ized to more effectively address urban problems. GOM has become increasingly
aware that urgent and drastic actions are required if the most pressing
urban problems are to be dealt with expeditiously. For this reason GOM has
approached the Bank with a request for assistance in preparing effective and
workable solutions to Morocco's urban problems, and to help financing projects
aimed at improving the living conditions of the urban poor.
1.06      Rabat, Morocco's capital city and seat of the Government, was
chosen as site for the proposed project for essentially two reasons. It
was considered mandatory to prepare the first Bank supported urban develop-
ment project in close and continuous contact with the Government adminstra-
tion. Because decision-making in the urban context is highly concentrated
in central government and regional mechanisms for urban planning and coor-
dination are still inadequate, and because the project would be multi-
sectoral requiring participation of many agencies in preparation, there



- 6 -
would have been a considerable risk of time consuming preparation if
another urban area had been chosen. The other reason for selecting Rabat
was the fact that a development plan has been established for Rabat as
first urban area in Morocco (para. 2.06). On the basis of this plan the
structural problems of the city and the underlying causes had already
been identified and rational project concepts could be developed to most
effectively address these problems. In addition, Rabat has many of the
problems which are characteristic of most Moroccan cities, such as housing
shortage, unemployment and inadequate services. Under these conditions,
Rabat appeared an ideal locale for a pilot urban development project.
Il. RABAT-SALE, THE URBAN SETTING, PROBLEMS AND ISSUES
2.01      The Prefecture of Rabat-Sale with an area of 2,125 sq. km has as
its nucleus the conurbation of Rabat-Sale which extends over an area of about
55 sq. km.   Situated on the Atlantic coast Rabat and Sale are twin cities
which are separated by the Bou Regreg River (map IBMD 13050). Both cities
are well over 700 years old. In 1912 Rabat covered an area of 67 ha. and had
a population of roughly 22,000. By 1921 Rabat had 31,000 and Sale 24,000
inhabitants, which had increased by 1960 to 228,000 and 76,000, respectively.
During the last population census in 1971 a population of 641,700 was counted
in the Prefecture. Out of this population, 82.6% lived in Rabat and Sale with
375,000 and 156,000 inhabitants, respectively. Today's population is esti-
mated at 495,000 for Rabat and 230,000 for Sale. These population increases
reflect a natural growth rate of 2.6% per year, and an inmigration rate of
3.7%. Rabat-Sale's population is expected to have reached 1.2 m by 1985.
2.02      The economy of both cities, is based on secondary and tertiary
sector activities. But secondary sector activities have declined since
Sale's port was closed. Neighboring Casablanca and Kenitra, both with ports,
have assumed the lead in the industrial sector along the Atlantic coast.
Rabat as administrative center of the country has continually attracted
migrants from the rural area in such numbers that it has become impossible to
provide enough employment opportunities. Out of the estimated 12,500 commer-
cial and industrial enterprises in the Prefecture only 450 have more than
10 employees. There are only about 300 industrial establishments. A sector
survey in 1971 revealed that 56% of the labor force worked in the tertiary
sector, to a large extent in the administration, 21% in the commercial, and
23% in the industrial sectors. In mid 1977 unemployment in urban Rabat
was estimated at 12.4% of the labor force. There are sometimes considerable
differences in unemployment rates from one municipal ward to another. Un-
employment among female household heads is especially high and may be as
much as 75% of the jobless in certain areas.
2.03      Both cities have old centers, the medinas, which are densely popu-
lated quarters with often deteriorating housing, narrow streets and archaic
services provisions. The absorptive capacity of the medinas was exhausted
a long time ago, and inmigrating population started to settle in the out-
skirts of Rabat and Sale. About 27% of Rabat-Sale's population lives in



- 7 -
squatter settlements, more than half of which are slums in their worst con-
dition; 17% in the medinas, mostly in deteriorating dwelling units; 15% in
apartments, and slightly over 40% in solidly built one to three story houses.
Existing housing stock in Rabat-Sale is estimated dt 144,000 units. Current
housing demand is of the order of 50,000 of which an estimated 42,000 repre-
sent demand for low cost housing. Based on population growth trends in the
Prefecture, housing demand is expected to increase by about 8,000 units
annually. During the 1973-1977 Development Plan period about 13,000 housing
units have been built; 4,300 of these units were built under the social hous-
ing program which reflects the lowest cost solution to housing currently
applied in Morocco. But at US$5,000 the costs of these units are still so
high that they are not affordable by more than 50% of Rabat-Sale's popula-
tion on average, and by more than 80% of the population in the Prefecture's
squatter settlements.
2.04      In the urbanized area of Rabat-Sale, there are three extensive
agglomerations of squatter settlements, i.e., in the quarter of Yacoub el
Mansoor and in the 7th Municipal Ward of Rabat, and the Ville Neuve of Sale.
These squatter settlements have partially long histories, and their initial
establishment as groups of tents housing tribal groups dates as far back as
1900 for Douar Doum, a squatter settlement in the 7th Municipal Ward. While
community facilities are by and large adequately available in Rabat and Sale
as a whole, they are far from sufficiently available in these squatter settle-
ments. This applies particularly to elementary schools, health care installa-
tions, and general community serv:ices, such as garbage collection and fire
fighting.
2.05      The Prefecture of Rabat-Sale is headed by a Governor.  The Governor
represents the central government within his jurisdiction; he is appointed
by the King and is hierarchially under the Ministry of Interior which super-
vises and coordinates local government activities. The Governor is respon-
sible for the coordination of the activities of all government agencies
operating in the Prefecture; at the same time he is directly responsible
for the administration of the PreEecture's principal city, Rabat. Through
this arrangement, the Ministry of Interior exercises direct control over the
affairs of Rabat.  There are also elected institutions of government in
Rabat and Sale, the municipal councils. These councils were established in
1960 and played only a minor role in dealing with the cities' affairs for
many years. But recently, new legislation has been enacted to increase the
councils' role in city management. As a result of the 1976 municipal elec-
tions, politicians who are responsive to the social and economic problems of
the urban poor, have been appointed as members of Rabat's municipal council.
First actions of the newly elected council demonstrate strong determination
to attack Rabat's urban problems, particularly in the housing and employment
sectors. But Rabat is not in a position to financially and organizationally
cope with its problems, and has encountered increasing difficulties in main-
taining levels of efficiency in administration, and in the provision of
services because of severe difficulties in attracting qualified staff, limited
financial resources and rapidly increasing demand for services.



- 8 -
2.06      The first attempt by the Moroccan administration to plan and pro-
gram for the orderly development of urban areas in the country is a metro-
politan development plan (schema directeur d'amenagement et d'urbanisme) for
Rabat-Sale which was prepared in the early 1970s. As a first experience in
the field of comprehensive urban planning, the plan has several shortcomings.
During plan preparation, housing shortages and unemployment were identified
as main problems plaguing the metropolitan area, but there are inadequate
provisions in the plan to deal with them.
III. PROJECT COMPONENTS. COSTS, FINANCING AND BUDGETING
A. Project Objectives and Scope
3.01      The proposed project should be seen as representing the first
important stage in the Bank's ongoing dialogue with GOM over urban develop-
ment, especially housing problems. While it is realized that several of the
existing policies, practices and procedures in urban development in Morocco
are not adequate to meet demand effectively, it is recommended that this
first Bank supported urban development project be devoted to demonstrating
solutions to some of the most difficult problems in urban development. This
includes technical concepts of and administrative arrangements for upgrading
the living conditions of urban low income groups. For other problems, notably
housing finance, gradual adjustments should be sought to minimize the risk of
market distortion and of exhausting GOM's absorptive capacity. To these ends
the proposed project has a two-fold objective:
(a) to introduce low-cost urban upgrading, infrastructure
and housing concepts which would ensure affordability
and incorporate improved cost recovery. This will enable
GOM to initiate country-wide programs to more effectively
tackle already serious urban housing problems, and to meet
social services and infrastructure requirements of urban
low income groups; and
(b) to deal with structural problems in Rabat's 7th Municipal
Ward which are found in the housing, infrastructure, social
services and employment sectors.
In addition to these basic project goals, measures are proposed to improve
GOM's planning and implementation capabilities for urban upgrading and devel-
opment programs, and to reform financing arrangements for such programs. It
is also proposed to establish special measures and organizational arrange-
ments for the promotion of labor-intensive urban economic activities, with
main emphasis on developing small scale businesses.
3.02      In specific terms, the project's scope comprises:



(a)  upgrading in three squatter settlements with a total popula-
tion of about 60,000;
(b)  an experimental sites and services/housing scheme for about
900 households which will have to be relocated from the
squatter settlements because of upgrading measures;
(c)  an employment generation program for the jobless in the
project area;
(d)  programs to rehabilitate and upgrade key sewerage and road
infrastructure, and to improve community services in
Rabat's 7th Municipal Ward; and
(e)  technical assistance in project implementation.
B. Detailed Prolect Description
3.03      The project represents an integrated approach to deal simultaneously
with upgrading housing, infrastructure and community services in a whole urban
district. The 7th Municipal Ward of Rabat (Maps IBRD 13050 and 13051) has
been chosen as it contains the highest concentration of squatter settlements
in Rabat. 11,900 dwelling units, housing about 60,000 people, out of about
19,000 dwelling units in the whole ward, with an estimated 1977 population of
about 100,000, are in the three squatter settlements of Douar Doum, Douar
Maadid and Douar Hajja. The average 1977 monthly household income in the
douars was US$94 compared with US$132 for the urban sector as a whole. The
three douars represent different forms and stages of development of spontaneous
urban settlements and provide an ideal background for testing urban upgrading
concepts. The area forming the 7th Municipal Ward is presently not included in
the development plan (plan d'amenagement) for Rabat (para. 2.06); a plan
d'amenagement provides under Moroccan legislation the legal instrument for
setting the development concept for an urban area. Preparation of such a plan
usually requires several years. Without provision for the development of the
7th Ward in Rabat's plan d'aamenagement there is no regulatory instrument to
guide and control land use in the project area. But the fact that the project
area is presently not included in Rabat's plan d'amenagement is not considered
as a problem; an approved zoning plan (plan de zonage) for the area would
ensure that no land use changes could be introduced at any time during or
after project implementations. MHAT has already drafted such a zoning plan;
the draft was found satisfactory by the Bank. Official endorsement and
issuance of this zoning plan is a condition for loan effectiveness.
3.04      Squatter Upgrading:  Planned squatter upgrading includes:
(a) integrated upgrading in Douar Doum (Map IBRD 13054). Existing
site and housing development forms in Douar Doum represent



- 10 -
the lowest development stage of squatter settlements in
Rabat. About 50% of housing is of primitive, make-shift
character providing inadequate living space and protection
against the elements. Infrastructure and coverage by commu-
nity services are poor. Presently, there is a population of
about 17,500 in Douar Doum representing 3,600 households
which squat on 3,210 plots in an area of 24 ha. The average
monthly household income (early 1977) in Douar Doum is about
US$85. Households to be relocated because they are squatting
in the right-of-way of planned infrastructure or becauye they
are squatting on extremely small plots (less than 25 m ),
estimated at about 780 or 22% of all households in Douar Doum,
will be compensated for lost property and resettled in a
planned experimental sites and services scheme, next to Douar
Doum (para. 3.06);
(b) integrated upgrading in Douar Maadid where existing site
and housing development forms are more advanced than in
Douar Doum. Only about 20% of housing is of primitive char-
acter, the rest has solid walls. But roofing and internal in-
stallations are widely inadequate. There is some infrastruc-
ture in a f ew areas, largely installed through self-help, but
overall, infrastructure and community services demand re-
mains to be satisfied. Today's population of Douar Maadid
is about 22,000, representing 4,500 households which squat
on 3,220 plots in an area of 20 ha. The average monthly
household income (early 1977) in Douar Maadid is about US$90.
Only limited household relocation will be required (about 100
families), these families will also be resettled in the
experimental sites and services scheme at La Butte;
(c) integrated squatter upgrading in Douar Hajja where existing
sites and housing development forms are most advanced in com-
parison with Douar Doum and Douar Maadid. Almost 95% of all
housing is solidly built but infrastructure and community
services coverage remain inadequate. Also, existing housing
needs improvement. Douar Hajja's 1977 population is about
19,500, representing 3,800 households which squat on 2,000
plots in an area of 19 ha. The average monthly household
income (early 1977) in Douar Hajja is about US$114. About 20
households will have to be relocated in the experimental
sites and services scheme at La Butte.
3.05      The proposed squatter upgrading in all three douars includes re-
habilitation and extension of infrastructure 1/, improvement and expansion

sions is given in Annex 1.

of commercial installations, home improvements through self-help with con-
struction materials and equipment: which will be provided under the project,
and provision of community facilities. The design for planned squatter
upgrading measures is being completed by consultants (para. 5.03). The
allocated plot costs of these measures, US$1,150 on average, will be affordable
by more than 90% of the population living in the three douars (para. 6.13).
Plotholders in each squatter settlement will be given secure tenure through
public leaseholds which will be transformed into private freeholds once the
plot costs are paid in full (para. 6.03). However, tenure arrangements can be
formalized only after the land on which the squatter settlements are located
has been acquired from its present owners. Douar Doum belongs to GOM, and
tenure arrangements for plotholders can be formalized. But for Douar Maadid
and Douar Hajja such formalization is presently not possible pending the
finalization of purchase arrangements which have already been initiated by
GOM. During loan negotiations assurances were obtained that all land in the
squatter settlements be acquired or expropriated I/ expeditiously. Government
possession of the land in the squatter settlements under provisional terms and
conditions is a condition for loan effectiveness.
3.06      Experimental Sites and Services/Rousing Scheme.  Between the
squatter settlements Douar Doum and Douar Hajja, there is a presently unutil-
ized terrain of 18.5 ha, called La Butte (Map IBRD 13051).  GOM has recently
acquired this terrain. It is proposed to utilize an area of 12 ha. on La
Butte to settle the 900 families to be relocated from the squatter settlements
because of upgrading measures. I]n preparing the site layout scheme, several
alternatives and combinations of plot cluster forms, infrastructure and
community facilities design, and commercial installations were considered and
cost-effectiveness analyses carried out to ensure identification of the least
cost-maximum effective site layout form and technical concepts (Map IBRD
13052). This resulted in site development costs which are about 25% less than
commonly experienced urban site development costs in Morocco. Three types of
residential plots will be available. For each plot type, different core unit
concepts were considered, and the least cost solutions identified. This
included functional and structural design as well as material and construction
method options. Two different core unit prototypes were designed such that
they are horizontally and vertically extendable. The associated unit costs
are about 50% less than commonly experienced core unit costs in ongoing urban
1/   Land acquisition can take a long time if no early purchase agreement can
be reached between the Government and the present land owners. But under
Moroccan legislation the Government can expropriate such land if no early
purchase agreement can be reached. Under such a procedure the Govern-
ment declares the land as of "utilitee publique", i.e. in the public's
interest, and takes possession of the land under provisional terms and
conditions (envoi en possession provisoire) until a final purchase
agreement has been reached. Once the Govermment would have taken
possession, the land could be developed as provided for under the project.

housing programs in Morocco. All plots will be provided with a contrac-
tor-built core unit. The costs of plots with contractor-built core units,
US$2,150 on average, will be affordable by more than 90% of the population
living in the three settlements (para. 6.13). Eàch relocated household will
be given a leasehold of the assigned plot on La Butte until land and develop-
ment costs have been paid in full, when a freehold title will be issued (para.
6.03). Displaced households will be given assistance in resettling; they will
be provided with construction materials and equipment for home extensions in
self-help construction.
3.07      Employment Generation Program.  Observed unemployment in the proj-
ect area is 24% of the labor force on average. With 31% Douar Doum has the
highest rate. Overall unemployment in Rabat is estimated at 12.4%. It is
planned to bring by 1980 the unemployment rate in the project area in line
with the overall unemployment rate for Rabat. This implies a need to create
about 2,500 new jobs in the project area. To this end essentially two meas-
ures are proposed: promotion and development of labor-intensive commercial/
industrial activities, and market-demand related training and/or retraining
for the jobless. Development in the project area of such labor-intensive
activities would be promoted through the provision of developed land and
credit facilities (line of credit) for building construction, equipment pur-
chase, and working capital. Although emphasis will be on the creation of
job opportunities in the project area through any kind of labor-intensive
commercial/industrial activities, special attention will be given to the
development of small scale businesses, which are the predominant form of urban
economic activities in Morocco. A small-scale business promotion unit will be
established (para. 4.07). This unit will provide technical assistance in mar-
keting, production aad management to businesses in the project area. Several
enterprises in Rabat have been identified as being interested in moving to a
planned industrial estate of Il ha. in the project area (Map IBRD 13051):
this site remains to be acquired by GOM. Government possession of this land
under provisional terms and conditions (para. 3.05) is a condition for loan
effectiveness.
3.08      Arrangements for vocational training and skills upgrading will be
provided. A vocational training center will be established to serve training/
skills upgrading needs of men and women alike. This training center will have
a capacity to accommodate 360 trainees. A separate center for education and
work will be established to provide employment skills to young women who have
either never attended school or who have dropped out. The center will accom-
modate 250 trainees. Combined with this center, there will be a day care
nursery with a capacity for 400 children to enable mothers who are household
heads to leave their children during the day while at work. The nursery will
include a facility for advising mothers on child care with special services to
monitor child development.
3.09      Community Services Equipment.  Garbage disposal is a particular
problem in the project area because existing equipment for garbage collection
is inadequate. As a result, substantial deposits of garbage frequently
form in the squatter settlements and attract disease carrying insects and
vermin. Improved garbage collection procedures will. be established and the



- 13 -
necessary equipment procured under the project. Fire fighting and ambulance
equipment is inadequately available in the project area. Special vehicles,
including ancillary equipment, will be provided under the project to supple-
ment the existing vehicle fleet to better meet basic service requirements.
During loan negotiations agreement was reached that this equipment be sta-
tioned and exclusively used in the 7th Municipal Ward.
3.10      Technical Assistance will be provided in the fields of small-scale
business development, vocational training, urban upgrading planning, prepara-
tion of housing finance reforms, and municipal equipment operation and mainte-
nance (para. 5.07).
C. Project Cost Estimate
3.11      The project is estimated to cost US$37.62 m, including contingen-
cies. The foreign costs component are estimated at US$15.55 m. Local costs
are estimated at US$22.07 m, including an amount of US$5.33 m (14.2% of the
estimated total project costs) in taxes and duties. The base cost estimate
is in October 1977 prices. The sources for the cost estimates and physical
contingency allowances are outlined in Table III-1. Technical assistance
has been costed at US$4,850 per man-month on average, which includes all
expected incidental expenses, such as housing, offices and transport. Price
contingencies have been calculated by allowing for equipment 8% in 1977, 1978
and 1979, 7.5% in 1980 and 7% in 1981, and for civil works 10% in 1977, 1978
and 1979, 9% in 1980 and 8% in 1981. For project management, the small-scale
business promotion unit, consultant services and technical assistance annual
price increases of 10% have been assumed over the entire project period. A
summary cost estimate is given in Table III-2, and a detailed cost estimate
is given in Annex 2. Cost details on individual project items are given in
paras. 3.12-3.16.

D. Project Financing
3.17      The proposed Bank loan for the Rabat Urban Development Project
will be US$18.0 million. The loan will be made to GOM and will finance 56%
of the total project cost, net of taxes, implying 100% financing of the
direct and indirect foreign exchange cost (US$15.55 m) and 11% of the local
cost (US$2.45 m) of the project. With the low foreign exchange cost propor-
tion of the project's cost, local cost financing is recommended as the proj-
ect will be of key importance in the sense of contributing substantially to
the achievement of a major government goal, i.e., improving the living con-
ditions of the country's poor.  As a first Bank assisted approach to mitigat-
ing urban poverty, the project should receive a reasonably significant Bank
contribution to its costs. The Bank loan will bear 7.45% interest and will
be amortized over 20 years, including a grace period of 5 years. Private
entrepreneurs will provide a total of US$2.95 m in equity financing. The
balance of the total expected project costs will be financed by GOM. Out
of this amount GOM vill allocate budgets, supplemented by loan proceeds to
the different ministries under whose domain the individual project items will
fall (para. 3.18). The project financing plan is shown in Table III-3.

E. Project Budgeting and Loan Application
3.18      GOM will allocate budgets and proceeds of the loan, as shown in
Table 111-4, to following goverument agencies:-
(a) the Ministere de l'Habitat et de l'Amenagement du Territoire
(MHAT) for financing of consultant services, part of
technical assistance, project management, the Small-Scale
Business Promotion Unit, land acquisition,squatter upgrading,
off-site infrastructure rehabilitation and extension,
the Experimental Sites and Services/Housing scheme, and
pre-elementary schools;
(b)  the Ministere de l'Education Nationale (MEN) for financing
the construction and equipping of primary schools;
(c)  the Ministere de la Sante Publique (MSP) for financing the
construction and equipping of dispensaries;
(d)  the Ministere des Finances (MF) for financing the line
of credit for businesses in the project area, community
services equipment, and part of technical assistance;
(e) the Ministere de Travail et de la Formation Professinelle
(MTFP) for financing the construction and equipping of
the vocational training center, and part of technical
assistance;
(f) the Ministere des Affaires Sociales et de l'Artisanat
(MASA) for financing the construction and equipping of
the Young Women's Center for education and work, including
day care nursery; and
(g) the Ministere de la Jeunesse et des Sports (MJS) for
financing of construction and equipping of youth centers.
3.19      There will be a special convention between GOM and the Municipality
under which GOM will undertake to prefinance an amount of US$3.8 m, repre-
senting the costs of community services equipment, rehabilitation and exten-
sion of off-site infrastructure, including primary roads, trunk sewers, and
electricity supply installations, as well as technical assistance. This will
include US$2.45 m of the loan proceeds. GOM will arrange through the Project
Implementation Organization (para. 4.02) for the implementation/procurement of
these prefinanced project items. The Municipality will repay the prefinanced
costs at 9% interest over 15 years, including a grace period of four years.
During loan negotiations the proposed terms and conditions of the GOM-Munici-
pality convention were reviewed and agreed upon. As a condition for loan
effectiveness both parties shall have entered into the convention.

IV. EXECUTING AGENCIES
4.01      Seven ministries, the Municipality of Rabat, and the Banque Centrale
Populaire, BCP (para. 4.14), will be involved in project implementation. This
implies a complex institutional background for the project, and experience
with multi-sectoral urban development projects is limited in Morocco. With
the exception of MF, MEN, and MSP who have adequate staff and well established
arrangements and procedures to fulfill their respectively roles in project
implementation effectively, all other government agencies often do not have the
technical expertise and required staff to implement satisfactorily project
items which will fall into their respective domaines. In the past, this has
resulted in problems manifested by implementation delays, poor workmanship and
cost overruns due to inappropriate supervision arrangements. Another problem
is the need for a concerted effort by all agencies which is essential to
ensure successful project implementation within the established time frame.
It is realized that project implementation will pose heavy demand for co-
ordination and supervision on GOM.
A. Project Implementation Organization
4.02      All agencies have agreed that the implementation of project items
which fall into their respective domaines be implemented under the supervision
of a project directorate. They insisted, however, that they maintain full
control over their respective project budgets (Table III-4). This has led to
the formulation of a project implementation organization which will ensure
participation of each agency in project implementation, and yet establish a
competent and coordinated project management. The scheme of the Project
Implementation Organization is shown in Chart IBRD 18188. A Project Steering
Committee will be established wîth the Governor of the Prefecture of Rabat-
Sale as chairman. The Governor's special role in city management (para. 2.05)
and his standing in the government hierarchy will ensure effective leadership
in the Project Steering Committee. The Committee will be composed such that
each agency with responsibilities over project items will be adequately
represented. To this effect the Committee will include the regional delegates
of all government agencies which will be involved in the project, delegates
of the Municipal Council, notably the council members from the project area,
representatives of BCP, the general manager of Rabat's Regie Autonome de
Distribution d'Eau et'd'Electricite (RED) 1/, and the City Engineer. This
Steering Committee will meet periodically and review and set the criteria for
project implementation. Problems which cannot be resoived will be referred to
an interministerial project coordination committee, composed of the chief
secretaries of all ministries involved, for resolution. This committee has
already been established by GOM and will be convened on demand. GOM intends
to maintain this interministerial committee for all future urban development
projects.

4.03      A special function in the Project Steering Committee will fall
to the municipal council members from the project area. They will concern
themselves with the public re'ations aspects of squatter upgrading and will
explain proposed project measures and cost recovery terms and conditions to
their electorate. This will ensure understanding of the project's objectives
and associated actions in the project area. They will also organize community
self-help arrangements for the construction or improvement of pre-elementary
schools and encourage the formation of household cooperatives for mutual
self-help in home improvements. Extensive discussions have already taken
place between the council members and the population in the squatter settle-
ments. Also the Governor of the Prefecture has had several contacts with
the local population through his local representatives, the Khaids and the
Moqqadems. The population has been made aware of the project, its objectives,
concepts and proposed cost recovery mechanisms. The response in the community
has been enthusiastic; there is a full support of the project with all its
objectives and concepts within the community.
4.04      The Project Steering Committee will have a permanent secretary
who will be at the same time project director. The Project Director will
head a project directorate which will have its quarters in an administrative
center to be constructed on La Butte. The Project Directorate will be com-
posed of two civil engineers, two architects, two surveyors, eight technical
inspectors, four materials clerks, two accountants, and various support per-
sonnel, such as drivers, mechanics, and secretaries. The entire professional
staff of the Project Directorate will be seconded by MHAT and will be super-
vised by the chief secretary of that ministry. The Project Directorate will
receive professional guidance and operational support, particularly in project
monitoring by a new unit for urban upgrading in MHAT (para. 4.10). The
Project Directorate will be responsible for managing the implementation of
all project items, except small-scale business promotion, vocational train-
ing, urban up-grading planning, and housing finance reforms for which other
arrangements are proposed (paras. 4.07 and 4.09-4.13). MASA, MEN, MJS, MSP
and MTFP will manage with their own staff the construction and equipping of
primary schools, dispensaries, vocational training and youth centers under the
supervision of the Project Directorate. This arrangement is acceptable to the
Bank. The Project Directorate will tender, award and supervise material and
equipment supplies, and civil works. It will manage construction materials
depots and provide technical assistance to households who will construct or
improve their homes in self-help. The Project Directorate will also review
home construction and extension plans and issue building permits 1/, which
will be  mandatory and contingent on plans which   have been assessed as
technically satisfactory. For the completion of detailed engineering for
different project items and for the preparation of cadastral plans and plot
documents for the land registry for each project site, the Project Directorate
has already hired locally established consultants (para. 5.06).
1/   A function which is normally the responsibility of the Municipality,
but for the project area this responsibility will be delegated to the
Project Directorate.



- 26 -
4.05      Through its regional delegate in the Project Steering Committee,
each ministry will keep control over the implementation of project items
falling into its domain. The allocated budgets for different project items
will remain with the respective ministries. Payments to suppliers/contractors
will be made by each ministry on the basis of invoices which have been checked
and endorsed by the Project Director. The Project Directorate will maintain a
central project accounting system to ensure control over the financial status
of the project (para. 5.08). Individual implementation schedules for different
project items will be established and monitored by the Project Directorate,
which will also prepare monthly progress reports.
4.06      Once acquired or expropriated all land in the project area will
be administered by the Service des Domaines, until the title for land can
be transferred to the project beneficiaries (para. 6.03). The Service des
Domaines, a branch of the Ministry of Finance, is GOM's agency in charge
of the administration of government owned land and estate. Prefinanced
housing under the project will also be administered by the Service until
title transfer (para. 6.03). The Service will prepare and handle lease
contracts with project beneficiaries, issue titles, prepare deeds, and will
arrange for legal proceedings in case of defaults in lease payments. During
loan negotiations the format of proposed lease contracts and proposed organ-
izational and staffing arrangements for the administration of such contracts
was reviewed and agreed upon. The Service des Domaines will prepare and
submit to the Bank for approval by September 30, 1978 standard lease con-
tracts and details on organizational and procedural arrangements for their
administration.
4.07      As integral part of the Project Implementation Organization there
will be a business promotion unit under the direction of the Project Steer-
ing Committee. As its main function this unit will provide assistance to
businesses in the project area in marketing, production and management.
Emphasis will be on helping small entrepreneurs or cooperatives (see Annex 1,
Section G) to get started and/or to improve their business. Consequently the
unit will be composed of experts who specialize in small scale business pro-
motion. The Unit will comprise three full time members and administrative
support staff. The professional members of the Unit will include one indus-
trial engineer specializing in small scale business/handicraft production
processes, one business administration expert specializing in management,
particularly financial management, of small scale businesses and cooperatives,
and a marketing expert.  One of these members will be a financial assistance
expert to be provided under the project (para. 5.07). In addition to its
basic mandate, i.e. advising small scale businesses, the Unit will do the
marketing for industrial land and commercial installations; it will assist
BCP (para. 4.17) in marketing the proposed line of credit to businesses in
the project area, and in the appraisal of credit applications flrom these
businesses. There will be a close coordination between the Unit and MTFP to
ensure that proposed vocational training under the project (para. 4.13) is
responsive to skills requirements of businesses in the project area. The Unit
will also provide professional guidance to the Project Directorate to ensure
required functionality of industrial/commercial site location and land devel-
opment standards, as well as building designs.

4.08      During loan negotiations the proposed organizational and proce-
dural arrangements for the Project Implementation Organization as well as
the proposed terms of reference, the staffing plan and the job qualification
requirements for the Project Directorate and the Business Promotion Unit were
reviewed and agreed upon. The Project Director has already been appointed
and participated in loan negotiations. His qualifications are acceptable
to the Bank. As a condition for loan effectiveness the Project Directorate
shall be operational and staffed with key personnel, be equipped and properly
accommodated. Assurances were obtained that the remaining staff of the Proj-
ect Directorate will be hired by December 31, 1978. Agreement was reached
that the Project Directorate will prepare a detailed project implementation
timetable by May 15, 1978. The Business Promotion Unit will be operational,
equipped and properly accommodated by September 30, 1978.
B. Ministere de l'Habitat et de l'Amenagement du Territoire (MHAT)
4.09      As one of the results of the Government reshuffle in September
1977 MHAT has been established as successor to the previous Ministry of
Urban Development, Housing, Tourism and Environment, MUHTE. It is not yet
possible to give an assessment of MHAT's performance, given that it has been
in existence for a few months only. However, it is probable that MHAT will
be more efficient in dealing with its assigned responsibilities than MUHTE
has been. Unlike MUHTE, MHAT's responsibilities are limited to housing and
regional development programs. MUHTE had responsibilities for Tourism and
Environmental Protection as well, and these diversified responsibilities
have posed serious problems to MUHTE in trying to cope with them. Due to
the limited availability of appropriately trained and experienced staff
(para. 1.05), MUHTE's performance was characterized by inadequate provi-
sions for and coordination of urban development planning. As a result,
MUHTE had a difficult start in fulfilling its role as coordinating agency
in multisectoral urban development planning and project implementation.
GOM became avare of these institutional shortcomings and their implications
for urban sector planning and project implementation. The establishment of
MHAT can be seen as an attempt to improve this situation. As another step
to resolving these shortcomings GOM has been actively considering for sev-
eral years the establishment of a school for urban planners and managers
and a college for municipal engineering technicians. For both institutions
financial and technical arrangements are being formalized; UNESCO is expected
to help establish the school, and the French Government is expected to help
establish the college. While both institutions would begin training criti-
cally required staff in the foreseeable future, it will take years to pro-
vide sufficient personnel for effectively coping with urban problems in
Morocco.
4.10      One of the project's objectives would be to help GOM improve or-
ganizational and operational arrangements for urban development planning
and project management. MHAT is the obvious place where these efforts should



- 28 -
be concentrated. For this reason it was decided to have MHAT take a principal
role in project implementation to enable its staff to gain project experience
(para. 4.04). During project appraisal MUHTE's management indicated its in-
tention to establish a special unit for urban upgrading planning aimed at
improving the living conditions of urban low income groups; this has been
confirmed by the new Minister of HAT. The Ministry has been able to recruit
a competent, professionally experienced manager for this new unit. Working
level staff for the new unit remains to be recruited or to be appointed with-
in MHAT. Under the project technical assistance will be provided to the new
unit (para. 5.07) which would assume a support role to the planned Project
Implementation Organization; it would provide technical guidance and be re-
sponsible for project monitoring (para. 5.12). During loan negotiations
agreement was reached that the unit for Urban Upgrading Planning will be
established appropriately staffed, equipped and accommodated by September 30,
1978, and that it will prepare an initial work program outline within two
months of its establishment. The work program will be satisfactory to the
Bank.
C. Ministere des Finances (MF)
4.11      GOM plans to address the problem of poor resource mobilization
for the financing of housing programs (para. 1.03). MF has carried out some
preliminary market surveys; the results of these surveys have led to the con-
clusion that no effective mechanisms to induce private savings for housing
finance exist in Morocco. GOM is now in the process of reviewing savings and
loans systems in different countries. Under the project a small ad hoc unit
will be established in MOF and provided with technical assistance (para. 5.07)
to prepare the institutional and procedural basis for a savings and loan sys-
tem in Morocco. BCP is considered as the prime candidate for handling this
system. During loan negotiations the proposed terms of reference and organi-
zational and procedural arrangements, the staffing plan and job qualification
requirements for the unit were reviewed and agreed upon. The unit will be
established and properly staffed, equipped and accommodated by September 30,
1978. The unit's work program will be satisfactory to the Bank.
D. Ministere de Travail et de la Formation Professionelle (MTFP)
4.12      This Ministry is another result of the Government reshuffle in
September 1977; it is the successor of the Ministere de Travail et des
Affaires Sociales. In an effort to better link employment planning and
employment generation programs with required actions to prepare the country's
labor force for employment, GOM has decided to establish this Ministry with
sole responsibility for planning and implementing employment strategies. A
major task of MTFP is to arrange for effective programs to provide or upgrade
the skills of the country's jobless so that they can be successfully integrated
into Morocco's economy. Especially the urban sector poses many problems;



- 29 -
unemployment in urban areas ranks highest in the country. The approach to
reducing urban unemployment will have to be two pronged: more job opportuni-
ties will have to be established, and the unemployed labor force will have to
be trained or retrained to meet job qualification requirements. It is this
approach that will be applied under the project. MTFP's experience in
strategic planning for employment, and particularly in vocational training is
still limited. The integrated approach to employment generation proposed for
the project will provide MTFP with an experimental setting where the prac-
ticability and effectiveness of different vocational training concepts can
be tested. MTFP staff will also gain useful experience through participation
in the planning and implemention of the proposed integrated employment
generation program under the project.
4.13      A vocational training center will be established in the project
area. This center will be operated by MTFP staff and will provide special
training in skills which are required by businesses in the project area. The
center will be open to the population in the 7th Municipal Ward of Rabat. An
initial training program and related curricula have been worked out by con-
sultants, FGU - Kronberg (FRG). MTFP will review and finalize this training
program which will be satisfactory to the Bank. Given the experimental char-
acter of the employment generation program, MTFP's staff in the center will be
provided with the services of a vocational training expert who will be hired
under the project (para. 5.07). A special liaison arrangement will be estab-
lished between MTFP's training personnel in the center and the Business Pro-
motion Unit (para. 4.07) to ensure that vocational training will be responsive
to skills requirements of businesses which will establish or expand in the
project area. During loan negotiations the proposed organizational and pro-
cedural arrangements for the vocational training unit, its staffing plan,
terms of reference and job qualification requirements were reviewed and agreed
upon. Curricula and program outlines, as well as organizational arrangements
for vocational training will be established by November 30, 1978 in a manner
satisfactory to the Bank.
E. Banque Centrale Populaire (BCP)
4.14      Under a special convention GOM will entrust BCP with the admin-
istration of the line of credit for businesses in the project area, and of
construction material loans, and with the collection of all charges from
different project beneficiaries for whom GOM will prefinance project items.
The only exception will be the Municipality which will repay the prefinanced
costs of off-site infrastructure, community services equipment and technical
assistance to GOM directly (para. 3.19).
4.15      BCP is a fully government-owned bank; it was established in 1961.
It is well managed and staffed, and can be considered as the major commercial
Bank in Morocco. BCP has varied resources; its own equity was US$17.5 m
at the time of project appraisal. BCP's headquarters are in Casablanca.



- 30 -
BCP's regional branch offices, the Banques Populaires Regionales (BPRs) are
located throughout the country. Each BPR has territorial boundaries and
enjoys autonomy of management within defined limits of responsibility. BCP
coordinates the BPRs financial and promotional policies and acts as their
clearing house. BCP/BPRs provide short- and medium-term loans and have been
established to serve small firms and individuals who normally would not have
access to commercial banking facilities. As the major banking institution
in Morocco which specifically promotes small-scale business development, BCP
has been chosen to administer the Small Scale Industries component of the 8th
loan to the Banque Nationale pour le Developpement Economique (BNDE) which was
approved by the Bank's Board of Directors in May 1977.
4.16      BCP has been commissioned by the Credit Immobilier et Hotellier, the
only housing finance bank in Morocco, to administer a special housing finance
program which is theoretically aimed at urban lower income groups. But these
lower income groups are not reached because of conservative loan appraisal
criteria, i.e., households with less than 500 Dirhams (US$114) monthly income
are not considered for loans. This applies to more than 60% of urban house-
holds. Terms for housing finance under this program are 15 years amortiza-
tion and 4% interest. Mobilization of housing finance funds costs GOM 8.5%
interest which implies more than 50% government subsidy to housing loans.
Under the project housing finance terms and conditions will be adjusted to
reduce the need for government subsidies. To this effect, project benefici-
aries will be charged 7% interest on loans to be repaid over 20 rather than
15 years (para. 6.03). Monthly installments for housing finance under the
project will be about the same as those under existing arrangements. BCP
also grants loans for construction materials purchase. Collateral requirements
for such material loans are quite stringent, however, in that the applicant
has to demonstrate that he has already partially built major parts of the
dwelling for which he requires further materials. Since this criterion will
not apply to many squatter households in the project area, the collateral
requirement for material loans will be relaxed and applicants will be granted
material loans on the basis of their assessed ability to repay. A maximum
materials loan amount will be established following this assessment, and
households can acquire materials up to the value of this amount from material
depots to be established in the project area.
4.17      BCP's current lending practices to small scale businesses require
30% equity financing in proposed investments. Since many of the future small-
scale businesses in the project area will be financially weak at the outset, a
reduction of equity financing to 20% of the total investment costs is proposed.
Furthermore, BCP's current small-scale business loan repayment periods for
industrial plot development and construction financing will be extended from
5 to 10 years, and from 2 to 5 years for equipment purchase financing.  For
financing of working capital the currently applicable maximum repayment period
of 3 years will not be changed. The interest rate to be charged on loans to
businesses in the project area will be 8.5%. The proposed line of credit
will not be limited to small scale businesses but will be available to any
enterprise or cooperative in the project area. However, to ensure maximum



- 31 -
employment generation, criteria have then specified to limit access to the
credit facility to labor - intensive businesses. To this effect the maximum
investment per job are set at DH 25,000 as eligibility criterion. Also, the
cumulative maximum of credit to any business in the project are will be
limited to DU 1,000,000. GOM has agreed to establish during its fiscal year
1979 a revolving fund as credit facility for small scale businesses. Credit
repayments by businesses under the Project will be channeled into this
revolving fund. The lending conditions and organizational/procedural arrange-
ments for this fund will be satisfactory to the Bank.
4.18      It is expected that the Banque Populaire Regionale in the Prefecture
of Rabat-Sale (BPR Rabat) will be appointed by BCP to execute the proposed
convention with GOM. BPR Rabat will establish a branch office in the project
area. The branch office will be accommodated in a building to be constructed
on La Butte. This office will be sufficiently equipped to handle some esti-
mated 12,000 individual dossiers covering plot charges, materials loans, and
different types of credit to businesses in the project area. It will receive
assistance from the Business Promotion Unit (para. 4.07) in appraising loan
applications from businesses, and from the Project Directorate in appraising
construction materials loan applications from households in the project area.
The office would have 12 agents of whom 6 will be collectors of monthly
charges from beneficiaries. Since the costs of squatter upgrading have not
been recovered in Morocco so far, there is little understanding about the
financial discipline of squatter households. It is expected that some house-
holds in the project area will not observe payment schedules, largely because
they are unfamiliar with such procedures. It is therefore proposed that
monthly plot charges be collected by BRP collectors for the first five years
after project completion; following this familiarization period, leaseholders
will make their monthly payments directly to BRP's site office. Payment
discipline will be monitored under the project. Once per quarter BRP Rabat
will prepare a report on the colLection of charges from beneficiaries and
submit it to the Service des Domaines (para. 4.06) so that appropriate legal
actions can be initiated in case of payment defaults. The branch office
will be established by March 31, 1978. During loan negotiations the proposed
terms and conditions of the convention between GOM and BCP were reviewed
and agreed upon. The same applies to BPR Rabat's proposed organizational and
procedural arrangements, staffing plan and job qualification requirements.
As a condition for loan effectiveness the GOM-BCP convention will have to be
formalized, i.e. both parties shall have entered into the agreement.
V.  PROJECT IMPLEMENTATION
A. Implementation Schedule
5.01      The project will be implemented over a period of 36 months, start-
ing in April 1978. The proposed implementation schedule (Chart IBRD 18187)
has been sequenced to ensure that functional and organizational interdepen-
dencies among individual project components are optimally incorporated in the
36 months implementation program. For instance, the Experimental Sites and

Services/Housing Scheme on La Butte wili be implemented first to provide
accommodation for the households to be relocated from the squatter settlements
because of upgrading measures, which will be carried out subsequently. Con-
struction materials and equipment will be procured at the outset of project
implementation to ensure that squatter households can benefit from these
provisions and technical assistance provided by the Project Directorate for
the maximum time possible. Land development and site preparation and con-
struction of installations for labor-intensive businesses will also be given
early attention in the project cycle to ensure that most of the project
implementation period can be devoted to business promotion and consequently
to specifc employment generation measures, so that achievement of the target
to create 2,500 jobs by early 1981 can be reasonably expected. To ensure that
the proposed implementation schedule can be maintained it is mandatory that
detailed engineering of land development measures will be available by April
1, 1978. GOM has already contracted consultants for the preparation of such
detailed engineering (para. 5.03). For the same reason it is necessary that
final designs for proposed community facilities are available by April 1,
1978. This will be done by the respective government agencies under whose
responsibilities different project items fall. Detailed engineering,
final designs for community facilities, and related procurement documents
will be satisfactory to the Bank.
B. Procurement
5.02      Given the relatively small volumes and amounts of the estimated
costs of different project items, it is expected that most project items will
not attract the interest of international contractors. The only attractive
amounts represent the cost of on-site infrastructure (US$7.25 m) 1/ and com-
munity facilities (US$6.82 m) 1/. However, on-site infrastructure reflects
by and large proposed squatter upgrading measures which are very labor inten-
sive because no heavy construction equipment can be utilized in the densely
settled douars. This implies high overhead costs. Both factors are likely
to keep international contractors from bidding. Community facilities will be
implemented by the different ministries (para. 4.04) under the supervision of
the Project Directorate. Each ministry will individually tender construction
work for the items falling under its responsibility. This will result in
several small procurement packages which will be unattractive to international
contractors. For these reasons, procurement of civil works will be on the
basis of competitive bidding as advertised locally. Local procurement pro-
cedures have already been applied under other Bank assisted projects; these
procedures are acceptable to the Bank. Supply of all materials and equipment
will be on the basis of ICB, in accordance with Bank guidelines. Local manu-
facturers/suppliers will be given preferential treatment in bid evaluation,
in accordance with Bank guidelines 2/. For the installation of water and

electricity supply networks, competitive bidding will be excluded in that
these services will be provided by RED in force account work at prime costs.
Under existing legislation RED has the monopoly in the Prefecture of Rabat-
Sale for the installation and operation of water and electricity supply
networks. There will be a special convention between GOM and RED under which
RED will agree to procure materials for water and electricity supply network
extensions through ICB and to install these extensions at prime costs under
the Project Directorate's supervision. During loan negotiations the proposed
terms and conditions of this convention were reviewed and agreed upon. As a
condition for loan effectiveness both parties shall have entered into this
convention.
5.03      Consultant services for cadastral surveys will be retained from
local consultants on the basis of proposals from qualified firms registered
with GOM. Consultant services for the preparation of detailed engineering
are being provided by the French consultants SCET who have already success-
fully worked on similar assignments in Morocco and whose qualifications are
satisfactory to the Bank. GOM has contracted SCET. Retroactive financing
up to US$250,000 of these consultant services is recommended under the proj-
ect. Technical assistance in small-scale business promotion, preparation of
future urban upgrading projects, vocational training, housing finance reforms,
and municipal equipment operation and maintenance will be retained from
experienced consultants on the basis of proposals from prequalified firms.

Any undisbursed balance at the end of the project implementation period
will be used to partially finance the purchase of further construction
material.
D. Consultant Services
5.06      The Project Directorate will hire consultants to prepare project
details which are partially required prior to project implementation. These
services will be financed under the project and include:
(a) Detailed Engineering: For all proposed infrastructure
rehabilitation and extension under the project detailed
engineering remains to be completed to establish the
required basis for procurement of civil works. Neither
MHAT nor the Municipality have the staff, sufficient
in number and qualifications, to prepare such detailed
engineering. For this reason detailed engineering is
being prepared by already selected internationally experi-
enced consultants who are established locally (para 5.03).



- 36 -
(b)  Cadastral Surveys:  For each of the five proposed project
sites, including Douar Doum, Douar Hajja, Douar Maadid,
La Butte, and the Industrial Estate, a cadastral survey
will have to be carried out to determine and to fix
property lines so that individual premises can be appro-
priately delineated and recorded in the land registry of
the Municipality and of the Service des Domaines (para.
4.06). The cadastral services of the Municipality are
inadequately staffed and will not be in a position to carry
out these quite extensive surveys in the time frame re-
quired. Therefore, local consultants will be hired to
carry out the cadastral surveys.
The contracts with and terms of reference for these consultants are or will be
satisfactory to the Bank.
E. Technical Assistance
5.07      Technical assistance in project implementation will be provided
through individual experts including:
(a) Urban Upgrading Planning: MUAT intends to establish
a new unit for urban upgrading planning (para. 4.10).
Staff for this unit is being recruited. MHAT has
however, experienced problems in hiring financial
experts required for project analysis. Indications
are that the same problems will be encountered in
attempts to recruit appropriately qualified personnel
for the new unit. Therefore, an internationally ex-
perienced financial analyst, specializing in urban
sector work, will be provided under the project for
32 man-months to assist the unit in analytical work
and to train local counterparts in the financial
analysis of urban upgrading projects.
(b)  Housing Finance Reform:  GOM intends establish the
basis for required reforms of the housing finance
sector in Morocco (para. 4.11). MF is expected to
carry out initial reviews of existing practices and
procedures and to prepare recommendations for a hous-
ing finance program which will effectively respond
to the financial assistance requirements of different
urban income groups. Experience in housing finance,
especially with financial assistance to urban low in-
come groups is limited in Morocco. Under the project
8 man-months of yet unspecified technical assistance
through internationally experienced housing finance
specialists will be available to MF to provide guidance
in sector reviews and technical know-how in preparing
recommendations for housing finance reforms.



37 -
(c) Small-Scale Business Promotion. Little experience
exists in the Moroccan administration with programs
to promote small-scale business. GOM attaches, how-
ever, great importance to measures aimed at improving
its support role to this vital segment of the urban
economy. To assist in small-scale business promotion
in the project area unit one internationally experi-
enced small-scale business expert will be provided
under the project for a period of 30 man-months.
(d) Vocational Training. GÙ>M intends to improve its
vocational training programs which are responsibility
of MTFP (para. 4.12). Proposed vocational training
under the project with its clearly defined ad hoc
orientation will serve as an experimental basis for
the proposed improvement. Experience with vocational
training programs in MTFP is limited. For profes-
sional guidance in proposed vocational training one
internationally experienced training adviser will
be provided under the project for a period of 20
man-months.
(e) Municipal Equipment Operation and Maintenance.
Organizational arrangements for providing municipal
services in Rabat, such as street and sewer mainte-
nance, garbage collection and fire fighting are
inadequate. This pertains particularly to equipment
operation and maintenace. Under the project municipal
equipment will be provided to improve community
services in the Municipal Ware of Rabat. To assist in
establishing adequate operational arrangement for this
equipment and also to assist organizational reforms
aimed at improving municipal services in Rabat, one
mechanical engineer specializing in municipal equipment
management will be provided under the project for a
period of 20 man-months.
All technical assistance experts will have assumed their duties by December
31, 1978. The qualifications of and contracts and terms of reference for
these experts will be satisfactory to the Bank.
F. Accounts and Audits
5.08      Each government agency involved in the project will establish and
maintain a separate project account reflecting its allocated budget and
incurred expenditures for the implementation of project components falling
in its domain. The Project Directorate will maintain a consolidated project
account which will reflect the status of all accounts of the different govern-
ment agencies. Preparation and maintenance of this consolidated project



- 38 -
account will be under direct supervision of MF. Within MF there will be a
special unit assigned to monitor the project's financial status and to prepare
disbursement applications to the Bank. The Project Directorate will prepare
and MF will approve and distribute at the end of each year a comprehensive
statement on the project's financial status.  The financial performance of
each government agency in respect of project activities will be audited by MF
once per year. The format and procedural arrangements for project auditing
will be acceptable to the Bank.
G. Operations and Maintenance
5.09      Operations and maintenance of project components will be handled
as follows:
(a) Infrastructure
- roads, sewerage                         Municipality
- water, electricity                      RED
(b)  Community Services                        Municipality
(garbage collection, fire
fighting, ambulance)
(c)  Schools                                   MEN
(d) Center for Education and Work
for Young Women                           MASA
(e)  Vocational Training Center                MTFP
(f)  Health Care Installations                 MSP
(g)  Youth Centers                             MJS
H. Monitoring and Evaluation
5.10      Given the proposed project's experimental character, it will be
important to assess the effectiveness of different planned project measures
in contributing to the achievement of the project's goals and objectives.
Among other things, it will be necessary to observe the interaction of govern-
ment planning and community response. Also the practicality of selected
organizational and operational arrangements for project impletation will have
to be assessed. The development of an understanding about the usefulness of
selected vocational training/skills upgrading arrangements will be indispens-
able. The insights gained will enable all agencies involved to continually
adjust their provisions for project implementation to ensure optimal arrange-
ments for different items in line with the project's objectives. It will
enable GOM, especially MHAT, to adjust the selected approach to urban upgrad-
ing, and associated technical concepts. Frequent adjustments, as deemed



- 39 -
desirable on the basis of continuing monitoring and evaluation under the
project will be a built-in feature of the project. Regular consultations
between GOM and the Bank will be scheduled to discuss and agree on desirable
project implementation changes in the light of insights gained from project
monitoring.
5.11      The existing baseline data for project monitoring is an almost
ideal one. A comprehensive socio-economie survey of all 11,900 families in
the project area was carried out between September 1976 and April 1977. The
data from this survey include information on household income, income source,
professional skills, education, household size and composition. An additional
health survey, complemented by clinical tests on members of 400 randomly
selected households in the squatter settlements will be carried out by June
1978. This will be done by MSP's Chief Medical Officer in the Municipality.
Detailed information on type and condition of existing housing in the squatter
settlements is presently being compiled on the basis of field surveys carried
out by MHAT.
5.12      Measures of effectiveness and related survey procedures, acceptable
to the Bank, will be established by MXAT's new unit for Urban Upgrading
(para. 4.10) in collaboration with the Small-Scale Business Promotion Unit,
MSP and MEN, by December 31, 1978. Responsibility for project monitoring and
evaluation will be within MHAT's Unit for Urban Upgrading Planning in which a
small monitoring unit will be established with staff inputs, as required,
from MSP, MEN and the Small Scale Business Promotion Unit. Project impact
monitoring will include, inter alia
(a)  physical changes in housing;
(b) changes in rents;
(c) changes in school enro]Llment and literacy rates;
(d)  changes in household income;
(e) changes in skills and employment (by type, location and
number employed per household), especially changes in
women's productive capacities and share in unemployment;
(f) changes in rates of incidence of selected diseases, and
of clinical indicators, such as blood composition; and
(g) changes in nutritional intake.
The Small-Scale Business Promotion Unit will establish particular criteria
for monitoring and evaluating the development of economic activities in the
project area, including production, turnover, labor input, market for produced
goods, etc. The Unit will be responsible for this monitoring.

I. Supervision
5.13      About 113 man-weeks of Bank project supervision will have to be
programmed for the three-year project implementation period. IDuring the
first year, 41 man-weeks, including 18 man-weeks in the field, will have to
be allowed for; in the second year 33 man-weeks, including 14 man-weeks in
the field; and in the third year 37 man-weeks, including 16 man-weeks in the
field will have to be allowed for. Following Bank staff or consultants will
be required:

VI. FINANCIAL ANALYSIS
A. Cost Recovery Principles
6.01      One of the project's objectives is to improve cost recovery of
urban development investments so that GOM's ability to financially cope with
urban problems will be enhanced. The costs of squatter upgrading and of the



-, 41 -
Experimental Sites and Services/Housing Scheme, excluding the costs of com-
munity facilities and off-site infrastructure, will be recovered from project
beneficiaries directly. The same principle applies to the Employment Genera-
tion Program; also the costs of project management will be recovered from
project beneficiaries . This implies that 67% of the total project costs, net
of taxes and equity financing by entrepreneurs (para. 3.17) will be recovered
from project beneficiaries directly. The costs of community facilities will
be borne by the Government budget. The costs of off-site infrastructure will
be recovered in conformity with official practice through a special tax, the
tax de premier etablissement, which will be applied citywide. Allowing for
cost recovery through the tax de premier etablissement in addition to costs
recovered from project beneficiaries directly increases overall cost recovery
under the project to 79%. However, the interest rates at which these costs
will be recovered do not fully reflect the cost of mobilizing project financ-
ing. As will be described in the following paragraphs, the interest rates at
which the costs of different project items will be recovered are partially
below the interest rate on the Bank loan, and interest on other GOM borrowings.
Adding only the cost of amortizing the Bank loan over 20 years to the project
costs and allowing for the yield of interest paid by the project beneficiaries,
increases cost recovery to 84%.  But when GOM's counterpart funds are costed
at 8.5% over twenty years, which are roughly the market borrowing conditions
for the Government, project cost recovery is reduced to 62%.
6.02      Yet, the proposed cost recovery terms and mechanisms imply a sub-
stantial reduction of government subsidies in urban development programs.
The costs of squatter upgrading, to the limited extent it has been carried
out so far, have never been recovered from beneficiaries. These costs were
borne by municipal budgets, which are dependent on central government sub-
sidies for that matter. The interest on housing mortgage loans will be in-
creased by 75%. The interest on loans to businesses will be increased by 45%.
The combined effect of all these measures can be seen as a major achievement
in GOM's long-range objective to establish full replicability of urban upgrad-
ing and development programs (para. 1.04). To illustrate this effect: if
official GOM cost recovery practices would have been applied in pricing
project items, project cost recovery would have been reduced by about 40%.
6.03      The costs of different project items will be recovered from
beneficiaries as follows:
(a)  Residential Plot Costs to be recovered from plotholders
will include the costs of land, cadastral surveys, site
preparation, on-site infrastructure, compensation 1/,
1/   Households that have to be relocated from the squatter settlements
to the Experimental Sites and Services/Housing Scheme on La Butte will
be compensated for their lost property. Estimated average compensation
per household will be DH800 in Douar Doum, DH8,000 in Douar Hajja, and
DH3,500 in Douar Maadid. The individual compensation amounts will be
established by the Project Directorate and will be credited as down-
paynent for a new plot on La Butte. The costs of this compensation
arrangement will be borne by all households in the project area who
will not have to be relocated.



- 42 -
resettlement 1/, pre-elementary schools 2/, and a
pro-rata share of detailed engineering and project
management costs, and interest during construction
(IDC). These costs will be recovered through monthly
charges. Plotholders will become owners of their
plots (freehold) once they have paid the allocated
costs in full; until then they would be given secure
trenure through leasehold contracts with GOM (para.
4.06). Leaseholds will be transferable. However,
until December 31, 1982, the selling price of a lease-
hold will be determined by the Service des Domaines
and the leasehold sale will be through the Service.
Thereafter, leaseholds can be freely sold by the plot
holders. Monthly lease payments will recover the
allocated plot cost at 7% interest over a 20-year
period. Collateral other than downpayment (compensa-
tion) will not be required from households moving on
to La Butte; a plot w!l be considered as mortgage. In
case of default on lease payments, plotholders will be
given a six months notice and evicted if they will not
pay within this period. The same rule applies to
plotholders in the squatter settlements.
(b) Commercial/Industrial Plot Costs. For commercial
plots in the squatter settlements and on the Experi-
mental Sites and Services/Housing Scheme and for
industrial plots in the proposed Industrial Estate,
monthly plot charges will be established which reflect
the costs of land, cadastral surveys, site preparation
and on-site infrastructure, and pro-rated costs of
detailed engineering, project management, and IDC.
These costs will be recovered at 8% interest over 10
years.
(c) Core Unit Costs. 900 core units (520 on plots Type A,
300 Type B and 80 Type C) will be constructed by
contractors on La Butte and will form the experimental
housing scheme. Cost recovery will be through monthly
installments. These installments will be established
to recover construction costs at 7% interest over 20
years. No collateral will be required; the core unit
1/   The costs of moving 900 households to the Experimental Sites
and Services/Housing Scheme will be borne by all households
in the project area who will not have to be relocated.
2/   Pre-elementary schools are commonly financed by households in a
neighborhood which they serve.



- 43 -
will be considered as mortgage. In case of default on
monthly payments, households would be given six months
notice and will be evicted if they do not pay within
this period.
(d) Construction Material Costs. Cost of construction
material made available under the project will be
recovered through monthly payments to BRP Rabat.
Financial terms of repayment will be 10 years at 7%
interest. A default rate of 5% on payments has been
assumed and associated costs are covered by a 1.2%
mark-up on the basic interest rate of 7%.
(e) Commercial Installation Costs. Of the 520 retail business/
service activity units which will be constructed under the
project, 300 will be constructed in Douar Doum, 120 on La
Butte and 100 in Douar Maadid and Douar Hajja. Cost recovery
will be through monthly charges which will be established to
recover construction costs at 8% interest over a 10-year period.
(f) Line of Credit to Businesses in the Project Area. The interest
rate on credits for plot development, building construction,
equipment purchase and working capital will be 8.5% with amor-
tization periods not to exceed 10 years for plot development
and construction, 5 years for equipment purchase, and 3 years
for working capital.
6.04      During loan negotiations the proposed cost recovery mechanisms,
their terms and conditions, compensation and relocation arrangements
were reviewed and agreed upon; they will be incorporated in the GOM-BCP
convention (para. 4.14).
B. Pricing
6.05      Plot Charges for the Squatter Settlements.  Plot charges in the
squatter settlements have been computed by pro-rating the allocable costs
of upgrading on a per plot basis. To improve plot charge affordability,
price differentiation among different types of plots and among the squatter
settlements has been applied; in that way residential plot charges in Douar
Doum, which is the lowest income squatter settlement, could be reduced from
DH8,350 to DH3,760.  This reduction has been achieved by increasing the
monthly charges for the 1,250 commercial plots in all three squatter settle-
ments by 5,485 Dirhams.  In addition, plot charges in Douar Maadid were
increased by 48%.  Table VII-1 shows plot charges for the three squatter
settements.

6.06      Plot Charges for the Experimental Sites and Services/Rousing Scheme.
Plot charges for this scheme on La Butte have been computed by charging all
allocable costs per square meter. To ensure plot charge affordability by
relocated households, two price differentiations among plots have been con-
sidered on the basis of land values, depending on the location on the site
of an individual plot. Firstly, plots earmarked for community facilities
and commercial installations were higher priced than residential plots
because they are sited in prime locations (Map IBRD 13052). Charges for
land for community facilities were increased by 50% and charges for land ear-
marked for commercial use were increased 300%. Secondly, plot charges for
60 residential Type A plots, 60 residential Type B plots and 60 residential
Type C plots which will also benefit from locational advantages were increased
by 50%. These increases in charges for plots in prime locations permit re-
ductions in charges for residential plots elsewhere on the site. In addition,
4 hectares of land in the Industrial Estate (para. 6.06) will be sold at
double the cost of land acquisition and development. The extra income earned
will be used to reduce the plot charges for the lowest income households to be
relocated from the squatter settlements to La Butte. Table VII-2 shows the
residential plot charges for the Experimental Sites and Services/Housing
Scheme. Finally, the impact of compensation allowances on plot costs and
associated monthly charges has been determined (Table VII-3).
6.07      Plot Charges for the Industrial Estate.  The allocable costs of
plots in the industrial zone, including costs of land, site preparation, the
cadastral survey, on-site infrastructure, and pro-rated costs of detailed
engineering, project management and IDC, are be 8.08 m Dirhams for the Il
ha. industrial zone; 7 ha. will be developed for industrial plots of varying
sizes. The per sq.m. plot cost allocation will be 100 Dirhams (including all
contingencies). Four hectares of land in the Industrial Estate are expected
to be bought by Category I businesses (see Annex 1, Section 6, para. 30).
This land will be sold at 900 Dirhams per sq. m.

6.09      Charges for Commercial Installations.  520 commercial installations
will be constructed and sold under the project at DH9,650 each. This price
includes all contingencies. Monthly charges for these 520 commercial instal-
lations will be DHI17. This charge will be applicable to any of these
installations, regardless of its location in the project area.
6.10      During loan negotiations the proposed pricing principles, and
different charges and rents were reviewed and agreed upon. Charges and
rents outlined in this report are indicative only; they were derived from
the appraisal-mission's cost estimates. The exact levels of charges and
rents can be established only once the actual costs of completed contractor/
supplier contracts are known. BCP will then, in consultation with the
Project Steering Committee and the Bank, establish charges and rents to be
paid by project beneficiaries.
C. Affordability Analysis
6.11      Observed Project Area Household Incomes and Housing Expenditures
in 1977.  The comprehensive surveys of households in the squatter settlements
conducted by MUHTE in late 1976 for Douar Doum, and early 1977 for Douars
Maadi and Hajja (para. 5.11), provided information on household incomes and
housing expenditures. The median monthly incomes in Doum, Maadid and Hajja
are 275, 310 and 430 Dirhams respectively (Chart IBRD 18186). The median
monthly expenditures on housing (rent) are 36 Dirhams in Douar Doum, 70
Dirhams in Douar Maadid and 100 Dirhams in Douar Hajja, which implies that
households spend about 25% of their income on housing.
6.12      Expected Project Area Household Incomes and Housing Expenditures
at Project Completion, i.e.. early 1981. Expected incomes for 1981 were
calculated under the assumption that nominal increases in household income
would be 8% per year, a figure derived from the past growth rate of national
income. It was further conservatively assumed that no structural changes
in income distribution would take place, which is unlikely because the em-
ployment generation program will bring about changes in income distribution,
reflecting improved earnings of present low-income households.

1ith the expected 1981 household incomes in the project area, the
affordability of plot charges has been determined on the assumption that 25%
of each household's monthly income would be disposable to cover housing
expenditures. The impact of plot cost differentiation and compensation for
required relocation has been evaluated and the results are shown in Table
VIII-4.
6.14      As demonstrated in Table VII-4, the allocated residential plot costs
of land acquisition 1/ and squatter upgrading will be affordable by more than
90% of the households in the three squatter settlements. In the Experimental
Sites and Services/Housing Scheme, it will be financially affordable to
acquire a new plot with a contractor-built core unit for 95% relocated house-
holds from Douar Doum, and 100% of households relocated from Douar Hajja and
from Douar Maadid. Following percentages of households remaining in the
squatter settlements could afford the estimated average cost of construction
material considered necessary for essential home improvements: 80% in Douar
Doum, 83% in Douar Hajja, and 81% in Douar Maadid.  Improved income brought
about through reduction of unemployment, expected higher wages, and subletting
has not been accounted for; the results of the affordability analysis can
therefore be considered as conservative.
6.15      Utility charges are recurrent expenditures which will accrue to
households in the project area, in addition to monthly installments for
plots, housing, and construction materials. In Douar Doum, which will be
provided with standpipes for water supply, each household will be charged
a flat rate of 4 Dirhams per month for water consumption based on an estimated
30 1/capita consumption per day. Plots in Douar Hajja, Douar Maadid and
in the Experimental Sites and Services/Housing Scheme on La Butte will be
provided with individual water connections. Based on the expected per capita
consumption in these three neighborhoods the estimated monthly charge for
water will be 7 Dirhams per household. The impact of these utility charges
on affordability will be minimal. Individual electricity connections to
plots would be installed by RED on application by the plotholder. The costs
of connection, meter rental, and charges for expected monthly electricity
consumption could be afforded by 60% of the households in the project area.
D. Project Cash Flow
6.16      The project's cash flow is shown in Table VII-5.
1/   In the absence of agreed purchase agreements for all project sites,
land acquisition cost estimates applied in project appraisal reflect
recent land purchase prices GOM has paid for land in the vicinity of
the project area.

VII. PROJECT JUSTIFICATION
7.01      The proposed project represents a first coordinated approach
to deal vith the structural problems of an entire urban district. In partic-
ular, emphasis vill be put on urban upgrading and better utilization of
existing infrastructure resources, and improvement of existing housing stock.
There is no precedent of such an approach in Morocco where urban planning
policies and practices have almost always been oriented towards urban devel-
opment concepts which implied high economic and social costs. The project
will therefore not only produce immediate benefits to Rabat in general and
the project area and its population in particular, but there will be long-
ranging benefits for all urban areas in Morocco. The insights and experience
gained during project implementation will influence central and local govern-
ment provisions for the development of other cities in the country. The
project will also introduce improved urban development planning, financing
and project management arrangements. Another far-reaching benefit to the
country's urban sector will come about through improved recovery of urban
development costs, which will be initiated under the project and which GOM is
now committed to improve further. As a result, government subsidies to the
sector can be substantially reduced enabling a larger and more replicable
public investment program to be undertaken. Finally, low-cost urban upgrading
concepts introduced under the project will enhance GOM's ability to serve a
larger proportion of the needs of Morocco's urban poor.
7.02      The proposed employment generation program will also produce
benefits with spill-over effects beyond the confines of the project. In
particular, the experience gained through monitoring the effectiveness of
small-scale business promotion measures will contribute 1/ to a better under-
standing of the development and assistance requirements of more than 80% of
urban economic activities in the country. It will also provide the Government
vith a better understanding of the labor and skills requirements of small-
scale businesses. The experience gained in carrying out the vocational
training program will enable the Government to deal more effectively with
urban unemployment in the country through market demand oriented vocational
training.
7.03      The immediate project benefits will largely accrue to the population
in the project area. These benefits will come about through improved access
and basic utilities, better sanitation, provision of social infrastructure,
such as schools and health care facilities, improved housing, skills upgrading
and provision of job opportunities. They will be manifested by changes in
the productive capacity and mobility of the labor force in the project area,
changes in consumption brought about by improved household incomes, increases
in school enrollment, and reduction in the incidence of diseases. Quantifiable
1/   The 8th BNDE project (para. 4.15) provides for similar arrangements in
three other Moroccan cities.



- 54 -
bailefits will result from project implementation include: increases in
land values through upgrading measures and provision of urban services, and
>uLwe ilproveuients brought about by vocational training and labor-intensive
business promotion measures under the project.
7.04      For each of the three squatter settlements and the Experimental
Sites and Services/Housing Scheme the expected increase in residential land
values measured by rental value changes has been considered as a project
benefit brought about by legalizing tenureship, provision of infrastructure,
community facilities, commercial installations, and improved housing. In
calculating the economic rates of return of associated development costs
for each site, the costs of engineering and project management have been
taken into consideration.  The economic rates of return of squatter upgrad-
ing will be 20% for Douar Doum, 21% for Douar Hajja, and 21% for Douar Maadid.
Sensitivity tests reflecting +10% changes in expected costs and benefits
affected the rates of return only minimally which indicates that the proposed
investment in squatter upgrading is sound. The economic rate of return
of the Experimental Sites and Services/Housing Scheme will be 19%. The
proposed investment in this scheme and the expected benefits have been sub-
jected to the same sensitivity testing as in the case of squatter settlements;
the results were similar. In determining the economic return of proposed
investments for employment generation the expected changes in household
incomes have been considered as a project benefit brought about by provision
of developed land for industrial and commercial uses, required investments by
businesses in the project area, and vocational training. In calculating the
economic rate of return of associated investment costs, the cost of engi-
neering, project management, and the Small-Scale Business Promotion Unit have
been taken into consideration. The economic rate of return of the employment
generation program will be 21%. Changes of +10% in the expected costs and
benefits implies a variation in the economic rate of return between 18%
and 23%. The overall economic rate of return of the proposed investment
under the project will be 20%.
VIII. CONCLUSIONS AND RECOMMENDATIONS
8.01      The project is considered as a first and important attempt to
comprehensively deal with the structural problems of an entire section of
one of Morocco's large conurbations. These problems are not symptomatic
for this urban area or Moroccan cities alone but are found in almost the
same character and to the same extent in urban areas elsewhere in the North
African region. The same applies to prevailing restrictive urban development
attitudes and policies, technical standards and financing practices in the
region. The outcome of the project and the experience gained during its
implementation will consequently not only provide useful insights for the
Moroccan administration on how to most effectively deal with urban problems,
but there will be interesting and indicative lessons to be learned for other
national and city governments in the region.



- 55 -
8.02      The project with its demonstrative character will improve the
living conditions and productive capacities of almost 12,000 urban low-
income households, representing some 60,000 people, and will also induce
institutional, procedural and policy changes in urban development planning,
financing and project implementation which will have long-ranging impacts
on urban development in Morocco. There are, however, some potential risks
associated with the proposed project. Firstly, there is the risk of in-
adequate guidance and poor coordination among different agencies which will
be involved in project implementation, and inadequate staffing provisions.
These problems have caused complications in project preparation and would
doubtlessly have a delaying impact in project implementation. However, in
designing the project, special consideration was given to GOM's absorptive
capacities, and the proposed implementation arrangements were devised such
that the likelihood of coordination problems reoccurring in minimized. Since
the appraisal mission left Morocco, GOM has devoted much attention to estab-
lishing better coordination arrangements for the project, and frequent inter-
ministerial coordination meetings have taken place. Also the Municipal
Government and the Municipal Council have assumed an active role in arranging
for project implementation. The new Ministry of Rousing and Regional Devel-
opment, MHAT, is better organized than its predicessor, MUHTE, to guide and
organize project implementation. There remains a fairly substantial proba-
bility that GOM will not be able to appoint or recruit staff, sufficient in
number and qualification, to ensure successful project implementation. In
that case, the provisions for technical assistance under the project would
have to be increased. Secondly, there is the risk of a potential tendency in
the administration to change technical project concepts which have permitted
low-cost solutions, in favor of more ambitious, albeit costly concepts of
urban development. This would have negative impacts on affordability. Such
tendencies have been repeatedly encountered during project preparation but
could be dissipated through convincing demonstration of effective and afford-
able concepts. Post-appraisal evaluation of the new Government has revealed
an honest determination within cabinet circles and inside the ministries
which will participate in project implementation, to establish a new and
more responsive basis for dealing with urban problems. The need to re-
duce towering government subsidies to the urban sector has also been widely
accepted, and ways and means are being considered on how these subsidies could
be reduced. The project with its proposed urban development cost reductions
and improved cost recovery mechanisms is therefore welcomed. Especially the
Municipal Council of Rabat has subscribed to the project with its new con-
cepts and is actively lobbying in the central government for endorsement and
support.  The probability of the second risk is consequently considered as
minimal.  Thirdly, there is the risk that land required for project imple-
mentation cannot be acquired in time to permit project i'lplementation in the
proposed time frame.  Three out of five sites remain to be acquired.  Should a
purchase agreement with the present site owners not be possible within four
months, the Government would declare the land as of "utilitee publique," and
expropriate. Subsequent price settlement with the land owners could take
years, but the Government could utilize the land under provisional terms and
conditions, i.e., envoi en possession provisoire. The practicability of such
an approach has been assessed by the Bank; the probability of land acquisition



- 56 -
problems is relatively low. Fourthly, there is the risk of the population in
a project area not accepting proposed project details, especially cost re-
covery. However, the Governor of the Prefecture of Rabat - Sale and "Lnic< 2a1
Council members have already had and continued to have frequent meetings with
representatives of the population in the project area to explain and review
proposed project measures. So far the response by these representatives has
been positive. The probability of this risk is considered as fairly minimal.
8.03      During loan negotiations agreement was reached on:
(a) community services equipment to be stationed and ex-
clusively used in the 7th Municipal Ward of Rabat
(para. 3.09);
(b) the terms and conditions of the conventions between
GOM and the Municipality of Rebat (para. 3.19), GOM
and BCP (para. 4.18), and GOM and RED (para. 5.02);
(c) the format of lease contracts between GOM and project
beneficiaries and related administrative arrangements
(para. 4.06);
(d) the organizational and procedural arrangements of the
Project Implementation Organization (para. 4.08),
MHAT's Urban Upgrading Unit (para. 4.10), MF's Unit
for preparing housing finance reforms (para. 4.11),
and for MTFP's training center (para. 4.13);
(e) a revolving fund as credit facility for small-scale
businesses to be established by 1979 (para. 4.17);
(f) measures of effectiveness and organizational arrange-
ments for project monitoring (para. 5.12); and
(g) cost recovery mechanisms, related terms and conditions,
and compensation arrangements (para. 6.04), and pricing
principles and associated charges to project benefici-
aries (para. 6.10).
8.04      Following prerequisites have been defined as conditions for loan
effectiveness:
(a) issuance of a zoning plan for the project area
(para. 3.03);
(b) Government possession and provisional terms and
conditions, as provided for under Moroccan legisla-
tion (envoi en possession provisioire) of all land
required for the project (paras. 3.05 and 3.07);



- 57 -
(c) that the conventions between GOM, the Municipality
of Rabat (para. 3.19) BCP (para. 4.18), and RED
(para. 5.02) have been entered into by all parties;
and
(d) that the Project Directorate be established, properly
equipped and accommodated, and staffed with key per-
sonnel (para. 4.08).
8.05      The project is suitable for a Bank loan of US$18.0 m, equivalent,
to the Government of Morocco.

PROJECT SPECIFICATIONS AND DESIGN STANDARDS
Topography and Subsoil Conditions in the Project Area
1.        The topography of the project area has been formed by the Bou Regreg
River. The river meanders through a 1.5 to 2 km wide valley which has been
filled with river alluvium over centuries. North and south of this valley,
the land surface rises to 80 m over a relatively short distance and continues
thence in gentle undulations as a plateau. This plateau is dissected by wadis
(dry river beds). In these wadis stormwater accumulates during rains and dis-
charges into the Bou Regreg. The wadis are increasingly deep and have steep
slopes as they approach the Bou Regreg. In the project area, there is one
such wadi (Map IBRD 13051). Subsoil conditions in the project area are char-
acterized by weathered calcareous sandstone which is covered by silty, clayey
sand of 2 m thickness on average. Douar Doum has developed on slopes of the
Bou Regreg river valley. These slopes reach 50% in some locations. Douar
Hajja and La Butte are on the plateau; Douar Maadid has developed on the wadi
valley slopes which reach 30%. The proposed industrial zone would be in the
Bou Regreg valley.
A. Squatter Upgrading
2.        Water Supply.  Water supply of all project sites is assured by the
Takkadoum reservoir located within the project area and by trunk mains serving
the western perimeter of Douar Doum, the northern section of Douar Hajja, and
the northwestern perimeter of Douar Maadid. The capacity of the reservoir and
the trunk distribution mains is sufficient to accommodate future requirements
in the project area. Douar Doum is presently served by eight standpipes lo-
cated on the eastern edge of the settlement along Goundafa Road. Each stand-
pipe serves approximately 2,100 people within a radius of 250 meters. Thirty
additional standpipes will be provided in centrally located small community
squares (placettes). This will reduce the maximum water hauling distance to
60 meters (Map IBRD 13054). Each standpipe will serve approximately 450
people. The placettes will be provided with three standpipes and a 2 x 2 m
basin for washing clothes covered by a simple roof awning of 10 sq. m. In
addition, each placette will be equipped with a fire fighting hydrant of
100 mm diameter. The distribution mains will be connected to the existing
200 mm main along Goundafa Road and will connect the placettes by means of
2,500 lin. m of 100 mm asbestos cement pipes which will generally follow the
improved footpath layout included in the project. This network will be sup-
plemented by some 360 meters of 80 mm asbestos cement pipes and 9,000 lin. m
60 mm pipes along secondary footpaths. Individual connections are not in-
cluded in the project. These connections will be installed by RED on demand
by the individual plot holders. Douar Hajja and Douar Maadid are presently
served by 54 standpipes. Each standpipe serves approximately 750 people. The



ANNEX 1
Page 2
existing distribution network will be extended to provide individual connec-
tions to the 5,100 plots in both settlements; design standards are based on
70 liters consumption per capita per day. The secondary and tertiary distri-
bution system will follow the existing road and footpath layout and will
consist of 8,700 lin. m. of 60 mm pipes, supplemented by 80 mm and 100 mm
pipes where necessary, to complete the existing secondary distribution system.
As in the case of Douar Doum all pipes will be of asbestos cement, except for
the individual connections which will be of plastic pipes. Twenty fire-fight-
ing hydrants will be provided from the 100 mm main throughout both settlements.
3.        Sewerage.  The three squatter settlements have rudimentary sewerage
systems built by each community with assistance from the Municipality.  Each
system handles sewage but not stormwater which drains on the surface, often
causing heavy erosion.  The existing systems are made up of 150 mm concrete
pipes which are mostly underdimensioned and in addition inadequately aligned,
vertically and horizontally. As a result backflows frequently occur causing
sewage to accumulate within plots.  In Douar Doum, pipes are for the most part
uncovered and many are broken causing sewage to seep into alleyways. All
systems discharge untreated sewage into open terrain along the edge of the
settlements. There are no trunk sewers serving the squatter settlements
with the exception of a partially completed sewer requiring rehabilitation
and extension near Douar Hajja. Under the project, each settlement will be
provided with a combined sewerage and stormwater drainage system and trunk
sewer infrastructure through which sewage will be discharged into a stabiliza-
tion pond which is presently under construction within the project area. The
system design is based on a five-year storm and a rain intensity of 220 liters
per second/hectare with an average run-off coefficient of 0.8 to account for
high population densities and further impermeabilization of roads and foot-
paths.  Sewage production is assumed at 80% of per capita water consumption.
In Douar Hajja and Douar Maadid the sewer network would consist of 16,000
lin.m. of 250 mm concrete and 1,000 lin.m. of 300 mm concrete laterals which
will be connected to the rehabilitated trunk sewer. Some 600 inspection
manholes constructed of precast concrete segments will be installed. In
Douar Doum the sewer network will consist of 10,800 lin.m. of 250 mm con-
crete laterals connecting directly to a 1,500 lin.m. long intercepting
sewer. The intercepting sewer will discharge into a trunk sewer to be con-
structed under the project, which will connect to the stabilization pond
via a stormwater overflow, discharging stormwater directly into the Bou
Regreg River. About 360 inspection manholes will be installed. In each
squatter settlement plot connections with 150 mm concrete pipes will be
installed by the community through self-help arrangements.
4.        Internal Roads and Pedestrian Facilities.  The present circulation
pattern of Douar Doum is entirely pedestrian and consists of narrow parallel
lanes, on average 1.2 meters wide between blocks of dwellings. These lanes
are often steep (up to 45% slopes) and are for the most part unsurfaced.
14,000 lin.m. of lanes serving Douar Doum will be paved and stepped on steep
slopes to stop the erosion which is already undermining the foundations of
many dwelling structures. The lanes will be provided with gulleys connect-
ing to the underlying pipes for stormwater drainage. In addition, a 4 meter
wide footpath network, 2,250 lin.m. in length, will be provided to link



ANNEX 1
Page 3
the placettes and provide horizontal access across the settlement (Map
ijRD 13054).  Most sections of this system will be aligned along existing
lanes and paths to limit required dwelling demolition to a minimum. The
footpath system will be constructed of a 15 cm crushed stone base with a
double bituminous surface treatment. In order to provide access for public
transport, garbage collection, fire fighting, emergency vehicles, and general
municipal services, some 2,000 lin.m. of distributor road will be constructed
of which 560 meter represent upgrading of existing unsurfaced roadways.
A perimeter road will be constructed along the lower edge of the settlement
with a carriageway width and standards which meet basic requirements for
access of essential service vehicles and public transport. Three levels of
service will be provided: a 6 meter carriageway for two way vehicle flows
from Goundafa Road to the existing and proposed elementary schools; a 5
meter carriageway for one way vehicle flows and passing of stationary vehicles
where the perimeter road serves existing shops within the settlement; and a
4 meter carriageway for the rest of the alignment along the perimeter of
the settlement. All roads will be constructed of a 20-25 cm crushed stone
base with a 5 cm asphalt wearing course.  In all cases, footpaths of 1.5 m
width will be provided on each side of the carriageway, with a 10 cm cement
stabilized soil pavement covered with a single bituminous surface treatment.
The present circulation pattern in Douar Maadid and Douar Hajja is essentially
pedestrian and many lanes are already surfaced.  However, several lanes re-
quire upgrading and will be surfaced. Both douars will be provided with
road access for emergency vehicles, garbage collection and public transport.
Saome 3,600 m of road will be provided in and around both douars of which
1,000 m existing distributor road in Douar Hajja will be rehabilitated
as part of the proposed perimeter road. Further 1,500 m of road will be
constructed to link the partially completed section of the southern link
road between Douar Maadid and the proposed Industrial Estate. The Douar Hajja
perimeter road is designed as one way single carriageway. Two internal
access road will be constructed within Douar Maadid along the alignments of
existing lanes to limit required demolition of dwellings to a minimum. Each
road will be 6 meters wide without separate footpaths, to allow two way
access for emergency and garbage collection vehicles. All road will be
constructed of a 20-25 cm crushed stone base with a 5 cm asphalt wearing
course.
5.        Electricity and Street Lighting.  There is presently no electricity
supply within Douar Doum; Douar Hajja is almost completely served with street
lighting; approximately 60% of Douar Maadid is served with electricity.
Street lighting will be provided in Douar Doum and Douar Maadid along the
proposed road and footpath system.  In all three douars each plot will be
provided with a metered electrical connection on request by plot holders who
will pay for this service. Demand of 1 KVA per plot with a 0.5 distribution
factor has been assumed in designing the systems.
6.        Commercial Installations.  Each settlement has developed active
informal trading and repair and small-scale manufacturing activities. Douar
Doum has some 460 small businesses distributed along Goundafa Road; Douar
Hajja has developed a small commercial center within the settlement comprising



ANNEX 1
Page 4
some 370 small businesses; and Douar Maadid has internal markets and a
shopping frontage along its northwestern perimeter, including some 570 small
businesses. In all douars existing commercial installations will be up-
graded. In Douar Doum, new commercial installations will be provided on
the 10 placettes to be established and improved shopping facilities/service
sector installations along Goundafa Road. The open market at the eastern
end of Douar Doum will be provided with road access, and some 60 small
covered shops with 12 m  usable floor space will be constructed.
B. Experimental Sites and Services/Housing Scheme
7.        The Experimental Sites and Services/Housing Scheme on the La Butte
site (Map IBRD 13052) is designed to provide accommodation for 900 households
which will have to be relocated from Douar Doum, Douar Hajja and Douar
Maadid as a result of squatter upgrading measures. The scheme will provide
for a range of alternative accommodations in size, cost and location, and
supporting community and infrastructure services. Land utilization has been
limited to areas with slopes not exceeding 15% in order to avoid high devel-
opment costs. The site layout comprises 12 hectares of land; the distribution
of land use is shown in Table 1.

8.        Interna' Roads and Pedestrian Zones.  A central spine road of 650 m
length with secondary feeder roads of 600 m length will provide access tor
emergency vehicles, garbage collection and delivery. Buses will be routed
along the central spine which is designed as a two way facility with a 6 meter
carriageway and 2 meter wide footpaths. The secondary feeder roads will be
one way, with passing bays, with 4 meter carriageways and a 2 meter wide
sidewalks. Ail roads will be constructed of 30 cm. crushed stone base with a
double bituminous surface treatment. Individual plots will be grouped along
pedestrian ways of 4 meters width and a total length of 5,500 m; they will be
constructed of 15 cm gravel base with a central 2 meter single bituminous
surface treatment. Shops and community facilities will be clustered around
pedestrian spaces of varying widths constructed to the same standards as the
sidewalks. Other pedestrian zones will be gravelled only.
9.        Water Supply.  Each plot will be provided with a water connection.
The site will be equipped with 5 fire-fighting hydrants. The specification
for the water distribution system are similar to those outlined for up-
grading the douars. Two 200 mm diameter feeder mains will be installed to
supply the site from the existing 200 mm main along Goundafa Road.  The dis-
tribution system will comprise:
Diameter          Length
(mm)             (m)
Distribution main                       60             2,600

Feeder main                            200               800
10.       Sewerage.  The site as a whole will be provided with a combined
sewerage amd stormwater drainage system designed to specifications which are
similar to those adopted for the squatter settlements. Each plot will be
provided with a sewer connection. The sewerage network will comprise:
Diameter          Length
(mm)             (m)
House connections                      150             2,000

11.       Electricity and Street Lighting.  The design assumption for the
electricity system is 1 KVA per plot with a distribution factor of 0.5. Two
transformer stations are planned to meet expected demand. The distribution
of low tension (110-220V) current to reach household will be through over-
head cables. Street lighting would be provided along vehicular routes and
in pedestrian areas throughout the site.
12.       Residential Plot Options.  Three different residential plot types
will be provided in the Experimental Sites and Services/Housing Scheme.
Each plot will be provided with basic services, comprising water and sewer-
age and electricity connections. The three alternative plot sizes and their
distribution are:
Type     Frontage      Depth      Area     Number      Percentage
(m)         (m)      (sq.m.)
A          5       x   12         60         520         57.8
B          5       x   14         70        300          33.3
C          8       x   10         80          80          8.9
Total                                         900        100.0
For each plot type a special house design has been established. Initially,
core units will be constructed. For plots of Type A and B core units are
identical and have 16.8 sq. m of covered area (Sketch IBRD 18086); for plot
Type C the core unit provides for 17.7 sq. m covered area. Each core unit
includes one room and a sanitary cubicle with a bucket flushed toilet.
The core unit will be located within the plot adjacent to the public foot-
path, leaving the rear of the plot for the provision of additional rooms and
courtyard. In addition to expansion rearwards, the dwelling units are also
designed to expand one story vertLcally, access being provided by inde-
pendent internal staircases to be realized after completion of the ground
floor (Sketches IBRD 18077 and 18L98). Vertical and horizontal extensions
will take place according to the individual owner's phasing requirements.
On plots of Types A and B, the core unit can be expanded horizontally to
3 rooms and to a maximum of 6 rooms with vertical expansion. On plots of
Type C the core unit can be extended to 4 rooms horizontally with a maximum
of 8 rooms with vertical extension; all plots will be demarcated by a con-
tinuous wall, 0.5 m high, designed to support the future extended dwelling
envelope.
13.       Commercial Installations.  Two commercial areas and local shopping
clusters will be provided within the scheme. All shops will be within
easy walking distance of all residential plots. The proposed distribution
of commercial floor space is as follows:

*    of which 120 units would be constructed under the project.
C. Construction Materials, Equipment and Depots
14.       Construction materials and equipment would be prefinanced and
procured under the project, and made available to households in the project
area for improving or for extending their homes. Materials and equipment
would be stored and available at two depots to be established at the
beginning of the project implementation period. One depot would be located
on La Butte to serve households in La Butte and Douar Doum; a second depot
would be located on the edge of Douar Hajja to serve households in Douar
Hajja and Douar Maadid. Each depot would require some 2,000 sq.m. of land,
and would comprise 500 sq.m. covered area for storage of equipment and
materials, 50 sq.m. covered area for administration offices and 1,450 sq.m.
open area for storage. The depots would be sold at the end of the project
period. Total requirements for materials have been assumed as follows:
Percentage of            Average Value
Households              of Materials
Requiring                 per plot

150 concrete mixers of 250 liters capacity, 300 wheelbarrows, and 10 hollow
block stone machines would be procured under the project. The equipment
would be maintained in the depots.



ANNEX 1

D. Community Facilities
15.       Community facilities which will be constructed or rehabilitated,
and equipped in the project area include schools, health care installations,
and community centers. An overview of existing and proposed community facili-
ties in the project area is given in Table 2; their location is shown in
Map IBRD 13051.
16.       Pre-School Education:  M'sids.  The M'sid is a religious school pro-
viding pre-school education for children, 3 to 6 years of age. There are at
present 16 M'sids in the project area, representing a ratio of 1 M'sid per
750 households compared with GOM's standard of 1 M'sid per 220 households.
These 16 M'sids are partially in poor condition and will be rehabilitated
under the project. The project will also include construction of 34 new
M'sids through community self-help, with construction materials and equipment
provided under the project. I/ Each M'sid consists of a classroom, 40 sq.m.
in area, toilets and washing facilities, one room for the Fquih, the teacher,
and a playground of 36 sq.m. The total area is about 80-90 sq.m. Design
standards are based on 2 shifts per day with a maximum of 40 pupils per
class. The M'sids will be provided with basic educational equipment,
furniture, and playground equipment.
17.       Elementary Schools.  The current primary school enrollment rate
of children in the 7 to 14 years age bracket in the project area is 65%,
compared with 88% for Rabat as a whole. The project includes the con-
struction of four primary schools required to increase enrollment in the
project area to the Rabat average without augmenting present double shift
usage. This requirement has been determined on the following basis:
1/   This would imply improved distribution of 1 M'sid per 240 households.

Number of pupils per classroom assuming               83 pupils
increase of enrollment ratio from 65% to
88%
Each school will be provided with required educational equipment and furni-
ture.
18.       Youth Centers.  There are presently no special installations in
the project area for youth care and guidance. Under the project two youth
centers will be constructed to serve the population in the project area.
One youth center will be located in Douar Doum and another on La Butte.
Each youth center will provide for a variety of facilities including con-
ference rooms, workshops for woodworking, pottery, painting, and photography,
libraries and reading rooms, and outdoor sports facilities such as hand-ball,
basketball and volleyball. The youth center located in Douar Doum will have
a covered area of 900 sq.m. and a sports field of 2.5 ha. in the Bou Regreg
valley. The center located in La Butte will have a covered area of 400 sq.m.,
and a sports field of 2,800 sq. m. Each center will include toilets, washing
facilities, offices, and accommodation for a caretaker, and will be provided
with required basic equipment, books, and furniture.
19.       Center for Education and Work for Young Women.  Unemployment among
young women in the age group 15 to 29 is particularly high in the project
area. About 65% of these women are jobless, mostly they have limited and
often no skills because they have either never attended a school or have
dropped out early. There is presently no program to upgrade their education



ANNEX 1
Page 14
and to provide them with basic skills required for employment. For this
reason a center for education and work for young women will be established
in the project area. The program to be offered in the center will be
spread over three years. First year trainees will be introduced to tradi-
tional feminine crafts; a three-month period will be devoted to basic
training in each of the following: embroidery, knitting, crochet, and
dressmaking. During the second year more sophisticated patterns will be
introduced, and the young women will be taught to use machines. During
the third year trainees will begin to specialize and perfect one craft
area in which they will eventually be able to produce and market items.
In their final year of specialization, the trainees will be commissioned
to do craft work which MASA would market through local handicraft showrooms.
While the program will have its emphasis on craft training, the basic
curriculum will be supplemented by reading, writing and elementary math
courses aimed at achieving functional literacy. The center will have a
capacity to accommodate 250 trainees and will include some 900 sq. m class-
rooms and workshops, and 275 sq. m space for administration, sanitary instal-
lations, etc. Training equipment and furniture will be provided under the
project. Combined and under joint administration with the training center,
there will be a day-care center for pre-school age children. The day-care
center will have a capacity to accommodate 400 children of female house-
hold heads in the project area, thus enabling these mothers to leave their
children during the day in good care while at work. There is presently no
possibility in th2 project area to leave children during the day. The child
day-care center will cover an area of some 1,200 sq. m and will include a
special wing where facilities for child development monitoring, such as
measuring, weighing, and basic medical investigations, will be installed.
In the center, services for advising and educating mothers in child care
will be made available.
20.       Vocational Training Center.  The lack of sufficient skills and
experience is a decisive factor for high unemployment in the project area.
A vocational training center will be constructed under the project. The
center will be located on a 1.5 ha. plot in the industrial zone (Map IBRD
13051), and will offer training programs in construction work, general
mechanics, electrical repair and maintenance for men, and programs in
tailoring and carpet making for women. The center will have the capacity
to train 450 workers annually in the construction sector, 60 in the tech-
nical services sector, and 150 in the textile sector. The center will
consist of 4,500 sq.m. of covered area, comprising 10 workshops, 4 class-
rooms, a materials depot, administration offices, kitchens, toilets and
washing facilities. Under the project all basic equipment, furniture,
tools, and instruction materials required for the proposed training programs
will be provided.
21.       Health Care Installations.  The Moroccan health care system is
based on a three-tier hierarchy. At the bottom there are dispensaries.
GOM standards provide for 1 dispensary for a population of 15,000, which



ANNEX 1
Page 15
is considered adequate. The main task of dispensaries is preventive medicine
services, health and nutrition education, and family planning advisory service.
Dispensaries are also responsible for hygiene inspection in their neighbor-
hoods, especially in retail installations, such as food stores and butcheries.
Given that the urban poor mostly cannot afford a private physician for health
counselling, they are critically dependent on dispensaries. Health centers
are providing curative medicine services for all those patients who cannot
effectively be dealt with at the dispensary level, and who have been referred
to the health center by the dispensary administration. GOM standards provide
for 1 health center for a population of 45,000 which is considered adequate if
3 dispensaries are available to supplement the center. Hospitals provide
services which are not available at the health center level and which require
hospitalization and intensive care of the patient. This three-tier system
enables GOM to keep the number of hospital beds in manageable proportions.
There are presently no dispensaries in the project area with its population of
60,000. One health center exists at the eastern edge of Douar Doum. This
health center serves the entire 7th Municipal Ward and is not fulfilling its
intended function properly, because it has to provide all services which are
normally provided by dispensaries. A second health center is presently under
construction in the 7th Municipal Ward and is expected to be operational in
spring of 1978. Under the project four dispensaries will be constructed and
equipped. Provided the dispensary and health center substructure is suffi-
ciently established in the project area, the present availability of hospital
services and beds is satisfactory with about one bed per population of 450.
E. Off-Site Infrastructure Rehabilitation and Extension
22.       Roads.  Off-site road infrastructure serving the squatter settle-
ments, the proposed Experimental Sites and Services/Housing Scheme, and the
industrial zone will be rehabilitated, upgraded or extended under the proj-
ect to ensure essential access to each site for public transport, garbage
collection, emergency vehicles, fire fighting and municipal services.
Rehabilitation of existing roads will include reconstruction of road pave-
ments and drainage. The length of off-site road infrastructure to be improved
and extended is as follows:
Length           CarriaReway
(km)                (m)
Upgrading                5.7                  7

Total                    9.5

23.       Sewerage.  The partially completed T150 trunk sewer in the wadi
valley east of Douar Hajja and Douar Maadid will be rehabilitated and
extended, and trunk sewers will be constructed to serve Douar Doum, La
Butte and the Industrial Zone. The trunk sewer to be provided for Douar Doum
will cross an erosion trench between La Butte and Douar Doum and will follow
the contours of La Butte slopes. Two trunk sewers will be provided to serve
La Butte; they will follow existing road alignments to the stormwater over-
flow at the southern entrance of the Industrial Estate.   From this point
sewage from La Butte, Douar Doum and the Industrial Estate will flow through
a single trunk sewer to the stabilization pond. Sewage from Douar Maadid and
Douar Hajja will flow through the rehabilitated and extended trunk sewer in
the wadi valley to the stormwater overflow south of the Industrial Estate and
thence to the stabilization pond. The lengths of trunk sewers to be rehabili-
tated and extended under the project is as follows:
Construction                          Length               Profile

Douar Hajja and Douar Maadid          1,350                T150
24.       Electricity.  A 20KV feeder main from the main distribution station
in Agdal to distributor stations Rommnani and S.O.M. will be installed under
the project to ensure sufficient off-site supply for the project area; this
implies about 7,500 m aerial powerlines with ancillary installations.
F.  Community Services Equipment
25.       In the project area with its population of 60,000 some 45 tons of
garbage are generated daily; the observed daily per capita garbage production
is about 750g. This rate is normal for urban areas as the one under con-
sideration. Some of this garbage is deposited at the fringe of the settle-
ments where it can be picked up and hauled to the Municipality's dump. Most
of the garbage, however, winds up either in the settlements where it accumu-
lates in the narrow alleys, or at the fringes where no access for collection
vehicles is possible. The proposed road infrastructure under the project



ANNEX 1
Page 17
will provide improved accessibility at the fringes. A problem to be resolved
is the collection of garbage inside the settlements. Under the project 30
garbage collection hand carts will be provided. These carts will be centrally
stationed in the settlements and will be used by individual households to
haul their garbage to 30 collection bins which will also be provided under
the project. These bins will be placed at key points along the fringe roads
or at central locations inside the settlements. Hauling of each household's
garbage will be declared mandatory, and adherence of each household in the
settlements to this regulation will be enforced by the moqqadems, the Gover-
nor's representatives in the settlements.  For hauling garbage from central
locations in the settlements to pick-up points along the fringe roads, 8
motorized mini-dumpers will be provided under the project. Five garbage
collection trucks will also be provided. Because of limited equipment avail-
ability in the Municipality of Rabat, which seriously curtails the provision
of basic municipal services in the project area, the project also includes the
provision of 3 multi-purpose vehicles with auxiliary equipment for street and
sewerage network maintenance, two fire-engines and three ambulances. All this
equipment will be stationed and operated out of a depot in the 7th municipal
Ward of Rabat. This depot will be constructed and equipped under the project.
G. Employment Generation Program
26.       In early 1977 unemployment in the 7th Municipal Ward was estimated
at 4,550 including 2,200 men and 2,350 female household heads. This repre-
sented 24% of the potentially economically active population in the project
area (Table 3). The highest incidence of unemployment was in Douar Doum,
i.e., 31% of the labor force, followed by Douar Hajja with 22%, and Douar
Maadid with 20%. The overall unemployment for Rabat is estimated at 12.4%.
These statistics have been derived from an indepth survey of the labor market
in Rabat by consultants, FGU-Kronberg (FRG) in early 1977. Under the proj-
ect, measures would be taken to bring by 1980 the unemployment rate in the
project area in line with the unemployment rate for Rabat as a whole. The
labor force in the project area is expected to increase to 22,100 by 1980;
by the same time unemployment is expected to have increased to 5,200, if
no corrective measures were taken. To reduce by 1980 unemployment in the
project area to the same level as for the rest of Rabat implies that 2,500 new
job opportunities will have to be created.
27.       FGU Kronberg has investigated existing businesses in Rabat.  There
are some 1,000 enterprises engaged in industrial, commercial or services
oriented activities. Ninety percent of these enterprises have less than
50 employees, about 7% between 50 and 200, and only about 3% of all enter-
prises have more than 100 employes. By far the largest proportion of these
enterprises is involved in various kinds of construction activities, in
textile/garment manufacturing, or export oriented handicraft. Some 1,400
different businesses have been observed in the project area; these include
small retail stores and workshops but also some smaller enterprises in their
formative stages. The goods and services offered by these enterprises are in
good demand.

28.       Particular to Morocco there is an outstanding phenomenon in
urban economic activities, i.e. the formation of cooperatives. This can
also be observed in Rabat. In most cases, small enterprises form coopera-
tives of painters, masons, metal workers, etc. These cooperatives which
share equipment, administration, financial management, etc., have proved
effective elements of the urban economy; they stimulate private initiative,
improve efficiency and income generation. But in their formative stages these
cooperatives almost always experience problems due to lack of expertise of
their members in marketing and management, especially financial management.
GOM is actively sponsoring the development of urban cooperatives and has
established advisory services available to cooperatives through the Office du
Developpement des Cooperatives, ODCO. ODCO is a division of GOM's Secretariat
d'Etat au Plan. Under the project the formation and development of coopera-
tives in the project area will be promoted through technical assistance and
financial assistance. Construction sector related cooperatives will get an
initial boost through their proposed participation in project implementation.
But also garment manufacturing and handicraft cooperatives will have good
prospects for quick development, given the demand for the goods they will
produce.
29.       In carrying out their investigation of existing businesses in
Rabat, FGU Kronberg identified enterprises that need to expand but are
unable to do so because of space constraints. Several of these enterprises
have expressed interest in moving into the project area, provided adequate
developed land could be made available. Many of these firms have already
now a substantial proportion of their workers coming from the project area.
Without exception, all firms are engaged in labor-extensive activities.  An
initial plan has been drawn up to accommodate these firms within a centrally
located Industrial Estate that will be established in the project area (Map
IBRD 13051). The Estate will cover Il ha and will be developed such that
about 8 ha of industrial plots of various sizes from 500 sq. m to 4,000 sq. m
will be available. Site development will include access roads, water supply,
sewerage, and electricity supply to meet an expected final demand of 5,000
KVA. Initial plans have also been prepared for the formation and/ or further
development of some cooperatives in the project area. These cooperatives
will be accommodated in the Industrial Estate as well. The enterprises that
will move into the Industrial Estate and the cooperatives will have an
aggregate demand for about 3.5 ha developed plots. In combination, they offer
270 job opportunities today, and they are expected to provide for 2,000 job
opportunities by the end of the project implementation period (Table 4). With
the potential for 1730 new jobs identified, there remains the need to estab-
lish the basis for 770 further new jobs in order to meet the objective of
establishing 2,500 new jobs by the end of the project implementation period.
The basis for these 770 new jobs could either be established in the proposed
Industrial Estate, within the douars or, more likely, in the Experimental
Sites and Services/Housing Scheme at la Butte. Detailed arrangements for all
2,500 new jobs will be worked out by the Small Scale Business Promotion Unit.
The proposed Vocational Training Center will prepare the jobless to meet
skills requirements by the enterprises or cooperatives expected to settle or
to expand in the project area. Women and especially graduates of the proposed

30.       FGU Kronberg has established a first approximation of space, equip-
ment and financial assistance requirements by enterprises and cooperatives as
a basis for the creation of 2,500 new job oppottunities in the project area.
About 45,000 sq. m of developed industrial/commercial plots will be required,
mostly in the Industrial Estate; it is expected that the Industrial Estate
vill be entirely occupied by 1984. Some 19,500 sq. m new industrial/commer-
cial buildings will be required during the project implementation period.
Based on broader experience elsewhere in the country and interviews with
enterprises and cooperatives it is assumed that on the average equipment
and working capital requirements will represent DH 2,300 and DH 3,600, re-
spectively, per new job opportunity to be created. A special survey was
carried out to determine the financial assistance requirements of those
enterprises that will move into the project area, and of the cooperatives.
As a result it is expected that about 70% of all enterprises/cooperatives
will require financial assistance to cover 45% of the capital costs, in-
cluding the costs of developed plots, buildings and equipment, and 30% of
required working capital. This group will be referred to as Category 1;
all remaining enterprises/cooperatives will fall into Category I.I. Cate-
gory Il businesses will be mostly in their early formative stages and will
develop out of existing entrepreneurship within the project area; they will
require financial assistance to cover 90% of their capital costs, and 60%
of required working capital. In specific terms it is expected that 50%
(50%) of the 45,000 sq. m developed industrial/commercial plots will be re-
quired by Category I (Category II) businesses, 70% (30%) of required indus-
trial/commercial buildings, 70% (30%) of equipment needs and 70% (30%) of
working capital requirements for establishing 2,500 new job opportunities.
Under the project a line of credit will be established and available to
businesses in the project area through BRP Rabat. This credit facility has
been designed to take full account of the estimated financial assistance
requirements of businesses that are likely to establish or to expand in the
project area.
