MEMORANDUM AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT
OF THE INTERNATIONAL DEVELOPMENT ASSOCIATION
TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS
ON A PROPOSED CREDIT
TO THE REPUBLIC OF TOGO
FOR A COTTON SECTOR DEVELOPMENT PROJECT
1.        The following memorandum atnd recommendation on a proposed
development credit to Togo for SDR 10.9 million (US$15.1 million
equivalent) is submitted for approval. The proposed credit would be on
standard IDA terms with 40 years maturity and would help finance a cotton
sector development project. The project would be cofinanced by CCCE and
FAC (respectively US$11.5 million and US$3.3 million equivalent).
2.        Background.  Cotton production plays an important role in Togo's
rural development. With about half the country's farmers (132,000)
presently growing cotton, which is usually the only cash crop available, it
has important income distribution effects and has led to improvements in
food crop production. In addition, it contributes 1O0 of export earnings
and has provided important budgetary support in the past. Because the
Government has encouraged and assisted cotton production through support
services provided by the public sector cotton company, SOTOCO, and
incentive producer prices, there has been an 11-fold increase in production
during the last 10 years.  This growth was carried out generally
efficiently: Togo's cotton production costs are among the lower in the
cotton producing countries of the Westen Africa franc zone, and cotton
quality compares favorably with the best in the region. IDA, CCCE and FAC
have been closely associated with these improvemwnts through two earlier
projects and three IDA-supported structural adjustment lending operations.
3.        Togo's economy is burdened by heavy debt, a poor balance of
payments, and low commodity prices for its exports which have reduced its
foreign exchange earnings.  One of the Government's main objectives in its
third Structural Adjustment Lending operation (Si.L III) is to stimulate
economic growth.  Increased cotton production could contribute some of this
growth as considerable untapped potential still exists. Of all single
crops, increased cotton production would provide the quickest and greatest
impetus to the rural economy and earn the most foreign exchange.  However,
constraints hamper further growth and reduce sector productivity at three
levels: (a) technological - a large proportion of farmers still achieve low
yields; b) economic - there is a lack of appropriate incentives for
producers and SOTOCO to improve their co;t effectiveness; and
c) institutional - SOTOCO's operating guidelines do not allow it to operate
along commercial lines, and SOTOCO should have closer-contact with the buyers
through more involvement in export marketing. The recent drop in Togo's
cotton revenues in CFAF terms, arising from lower international prices and
weakness of the U.S. dollar in which cotton is traded, highlights the
urgent need to deal with the cotton sector's constraints. Recent SAL III
agreements are assisting in eliminating some of these constraints: a
framework for setting flexible export crop prices has been set and a
reorganization of export marketing arrangements has begun.



-2-
4.        Project Obiectives.  To further support the cotton sector's
impressive growth, the project would increase cotton and food crop
production and productivity, improve the cost-effectiveness of cotton
sector operations, and introduce new financial/institutional arrangements
that would provide flexibility and incentives to the cotton sector
participants. In addition, the project would support the Government's
agricultural strategy of moving from area development projects to
establishing more effective national level services while reducing costs.
SOTOCO would carry out this strategy by structuring and managing support
services according to the national norms recently established, thus
allowing the amalgamation of national services by the time the project is
completed.
5.        Proiect Description.  The project would be implemented over a
four-year period throughout most of the country and would reach over
168,000 cotton and food crop farmers (about 60Z of the total) by project
completion. The three-point project would include:
a)   Raising production and productivity of cotton and food crops by
increasing the effectiveness of SOTOCO's support services,
including agricultural extension, adaptive research, input
supply, training, monitoring and evaluation, and maintaining
feeder roads in cotton areas. Special attention would be given
to creating and supporting new farmers groups, introducing
integrated pest management, and providing selected technical
assistance. A warehouse would be built in Lome to accommodate
the increased cotton production;
b)   increasing the efficiency and cutting the costs of cotton
processing and primary and export marketing; and
c)   improving sector financial arrangements by gradually eliminating
subsidies, changing SOTOCO's operating guidelines so that it can
operate along commercial lines, and-implementing a producer price
policy that provides incentives to farmers and SOTOCO while being
responsive to world market prices.
The project combines project investment and sector reform. A matrix of
monitorable actions included in the project is presented on pages 5 and 6.
6.        Rationale for IDA Involvement.  IDA's agricultural policy
dialogue with the Government through three structural adjustment operations
aimed at promoting efficiency and growth while restructuring the support
services to the sector has generally been successful in bringing about
substantial changes in government policy. It now needs to be followed by
productive investments such as the proposed project, if the policy changes
are to have the intended effect. The project would also be in line with an
economy-wide growth strategy supported by IDA, aimed at increasing export
revenues to help E- * .Lae ,Togo's serious debt burden.  For agriculture,
this strategy includes most importantly the introduction of more flexible



-3-
producer prices for major crops (coffee, cocoa. cotton) and refcrm of
public sector institutions serving agriculture (to reduce costs and
streamline services). The Government wishes IDA, which has been closely
identified with the growth of the cotton sector and food crop production
since 1977 in two earlier projects, to assist in introducing financial and
operational adjustments aimed at setting the industry on a commercial and
self-sustaining basis. In addition, the project would support the
Government's agricultural strategy by helping to set up more effective and
less costly national support services.
7.        The Government has agreed to the follo*ing actions:  a) subsidies
on cotton insecticides would be eliminated over four years; b) SOTOCO's
expenditures on agricultural extension services would be progressively
integrated into the national budget; and c) the Government would submit to
-ne cofinanciers for approval, plans for the transfer of SOTOCO's support
services to national services.
8.        The Main Conditions of Effectiveness would be the following:  a)
Producer price policy responsive to world market prices would be
introduced; b) the Government would amend SOTOCO's operating guidelines to
allow it to operate on a commercial basis; c) 25X of subsidies on cotton
insecticides would be eliminated; and d) CCCE's and FAC's effectiveness
conditions would be fulfilled.
9.        Condition of Disbursement would be Government's creation of the
Producer Floor Price Support Fund's institutional and financial framework.
10.       A general agreement has been reached under SAL III to introduce
flexible producer pricing of export crops. The formula proposed in the,
project follows the SAL III agreement, but is specifically tailored to the
cotton sector requirements.
11.       Benefits.  The project benefits include improved efficiency of
Togo's successful cotton production and a-more competitive edge on the
international markets. The project would also support Government's
restructuring of its rural development services and policies. As most of
the large capital investments typical of a cotton industry have already
been made under the two earlier cotton projects, and-production is
forecast to increase almost 60X at a relatively small incremental cost, the
rate of return is high (over 50X). The revenues of the sector participants
(farmers, SOTOCO, and the Government) are projected to increase
significantly. Because most of the country's poor live in rural areas, the
project would have an important poverty alleviation benefit.
12.       Risks.  As the agricultural technology is field tested and the
institutional structures already exist, the risks are few. The main
project risk would be that, as subsidies are removed, farmers may attempt
to save on input costs by not using the correct amount of insecticides. A
more effective extension service and a pest scouting program would provide
the information and monitoring necessary to ensure proper insecticide use.
Experience in neighboring countries where subsidies have been eliminated
indicates that farmers understand the value of insecticide use and do not



-4-
significantly reduce its use.  A second risk, exogenous to the project but
inherent to the industry, is the possible decline in world price below the
Bank's projections. However, Togo's ability to tolerate world price
fluctuations would be significantly improved because the project would
bring about an estimated 272 cost reduction in real terms, which would also
improve the sector competitive position.
13.       Recommendation.  I am satisfied that the proposed credit comply
with the Articles of Agreement of the Association and recommend that the
Executive Directors approve the proposed credit.
