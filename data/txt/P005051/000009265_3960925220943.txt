PROJECT COMPLETION REPORT
ARAB REPUBLIC OF EGYPT
PORT SAID PORT EXPANSION AND REHABILITATION PROJECT
(LOAN 2569-EGT)
PREFACE
This is the Project Completion Report (PCR) for the Port Said Port
Expansion and Rehabilitation Project in Egypt, for which Loan 2569-EGT in the
amount of US$37.0 million was approved on June 6, 1985. The loan was closed
on June 30, 1991 with $19.67 million cancelled. The last disbursement was on
December 6, 1991.
The PCR was jointly prepared by the Infrastructure Operations
Division of the Middle East and North Africa Regional office (Preface,
Evaluation Summary, Parts I and III), and the Borrower (Part II).
Preparation of this PCR was started during the Bank's August 1991
supervision mission of the project, and is based, inter alia, on the Staff
Appraisal Report; the Loan, Guarantee, and Project Agreements; supervision
reports; correspondence between the Bank and the Borrower; and internal Bank
memoranda.

PROJECT COMPLETION REPORT
ARAB REPUBLIC OF EGYPT
PORT SAID PORT EXPANSION AND REHABILITATION PROJECT
(LOAN 2569-EGT)
EVALUATION SUMMARY
Oblectives
1.    The objectives of the project were to: (a) reduce excessive utilization
of barges to unload general cargo ships moored at buoys located near the
eastern bank of the Suez Canal and the shallow draft berths at Port Said; (b)
increase port productivity by rehabilitating existing port facilities; (c)
improve the efficiency of port operations by providing modern cargo handling
equipment; and, (d) strengthen PSPA's management including budgetary control,
planning, cost accounting, and internal audit through technical assistance and
staff training.
Im2lementation ExDerience
2.    Although the loan was approved by the Board on June 6, 1985, the loan
documents were not signed until March 14, 1986, and the loan did not become
effective until February 20, 1987 due to delay in its ratification by the
Peoples' Assembly. While this necessitated some modifications to the
implementation schedule, some preparatory works had already been undertaken to
minimize delays to project components.   However, all main components of the
project, which was reduced in scope through cancellation of part of the loan,
were completed within the anticipated period up to the closing date of June
30, 1991.
3.    Tn all, US$ 19.67 million representing 53% of the total loan amount of
USs 37 million was cancelled. The cancellations were primarily due to:
(i)   more competitive bids than forecast being received for the civil
works with consequent reduction in the need for part of the
contingency allocation, and
(ii) reduced requirement for additional cargo handling equipment in the
light of current traffic trends and the availability of sufficient
equipment from stevedores to cover immediate requirements.
4.    Overall, the total project cost was US$ 25.1 million or 51% less than
the appraisal estimate. (The revised category allocations relating to the
above are shown in Table 3.)
5.    The project did not incur any serious procurement problems, although
there was delay in the completion of the multi-purpose berth due to problems
with the driving and extension of the tubular piling supporting the berth
superstructure. Only some rubber fendering remains to be fitted to existing
berths as and when such berths become available (para. 5.01).



ill
Proiect Results
6.    The project was successful in meeting its principal objectives of
reducing excessive utilization of barges to unload general cargo ships moored
at buoys near the eastern bank of the Suez Canal, improving port productivity,
and strengthening PSPA's management capabilities and systems.
7.    Actual traffic at Port Said declined precipitously during the 1985-90
period. Dry bulk and general cargo traffic declined from 4.7 million tons in
1985 to 4.2 million tons in 1986 and dropped to 2.6 million tons in 1987
(Table 8). Actual traffic of 2.7 million tons in 1990 represented only 56
percent of the appraisal projected traffic of 4.9 million.
8.    The decline in traffic at Port Said reflects the general decline in
traffic within Egypt's port subsector. At appraisal, traffic for all ports
was projected to increase from a 1983 base of 28.7 million tons to 32.1
million tons in 1990, while actual traffic was only 22.8 million tons (Table
9). Reasons for the shortfall in traffic include: (a) import restrictions
imposed during the mid-1980s in response to worsening macroeconomic
conditions, (b) continued languishing of exports, (c) slowdown of economic
growth which averaged 8.5 percent annually during 1980-85 to an average annual
growth rate of 2.6 percent during 1986-90. In the case of cement, which
accounts for 0.8 million tons of the traffic shortfall, the traffic declined
because of a government decree curtailing cement imports. The large shortfall
in flour and sugar imports were similarly affected by import restrictions.
9.    The economic re-evaluation of the project results in an economic rate of
return of 16.3 percent, as compared to the appraisal estimate of 22 percent
(Table 10). The lower rate of return is the result of substantial differences
that occurred in both project costs and benefits. Project costs were reduced
by 41 percent (in economic terms) from US$ 40.0 million to US$ 23.5 million as
a result of a highly competitive bid price obtained for civil works (para.
5.01), the devaluation of the Egyptian pound (para. 5.04) and the cancellation
of mobile cargo handling equipment which was to have been procured under the
project (para. 5.03).   Project benefits, attributable to savings in ship
time, cargo handling costs and freight rates due to the reduction in
lighterage were still attained, albeit at lower levels than projected due to
the reduced traffic volumes.
Prolect Sustainability
10.   The virtual elimination of lightering activity at Port Said, the
principal project benefit, should be sustainable throughout the project life
as the facilities built should provide sufficient port capacity to accommodate
current and projected traffic. There is a risk that due to the deterioration
of PSPA's financial performance in recent years, allocation for proper
maintenance of PSPA equipment and facilities could suffer. However, the
present port management is committed to maintaining port facilities and
several proposed measures are presently pending approval from central
government agencies that could alleviate some of PSPA's financial concerns
(para. 7.04).



iv
Findinas and Lessons Learned
11.   Findings and lessons to be learned from the project are:
(a)   Despite the initial delay in loan effectiveness, and from berth
construction problems and delays, the time frame as determined in
the SAR proved adequate for satisfactory completion of the project
before the closing date of the loan (paras. 5.01 and 5.07).
(b)   Loan cancellations, while generally not desirable, provided
flexibility which improved the performance of project by matching
facilities and equipment investments to revised needs
corresponding to the decline in traffic. It is unlikely that the
depth and duration of the traffic decline, due to macroeconomic
factors, could have been anticipated during loan preparation
(para. 5.03).
(c)   PSPA is in a difficult financial position wherein some of its
lucrative cargoes such as cement and wheat are no longer handled
in Port Said, but have been diverted to Damietta or reduced due to
import restrictions, and port revenues have been constrained due
to the need to remain competitive with other ports and Suez Canal
Authority control over some port functions and areas.
(d)   The setting up of the MIS in Port Said under the project should
assist PSPA in improving the operational efficiency of the port,
and the utilization of a Marketing Specialist should help to
promote the facilities and services the port has to offer to
potential overseas users. The recent Gulf War did provide a spin-
off for Port Said for transshipment of supplies into the Gulf and
permitted it to demonstrate its handling capability for transit
containers (paras. 6.02 and 9.02).

(LOAN 2569-EGT)
PART I: PROJECT REVIEW FROM BANK'S PERSPECTIVE
1.    Proiect Identity
Project Name:          Port Said Port Expansion and Rehabilitation Project
Loan Number:           2569-EGT
Regional V.P. Unit:   Middle East and North Africa
Country:               Egypt
Sector:                Transportation
2.    Bfackground
Sector Development Obiectives
2.01        In 1976, the Egyptian Government initiated a two-phased
comprehensive National Transport Study (NTS), partially financed under the
Bank's Second Railway Project (Loan 1098-EGT). On the basis of the NTS Phase
II, a Five-Year Transport Plan for 1983-87 was prepared and incorporated in
the Government's National Development Plan for the same period.   In June
1984, the Transport Plan was updated to reflect the finding that traffic,
particularly that of ports, had been increasing more rapidly than projected
earlier.
2.02        The transport strategy contained in the updated plan included the
following aims:
(a)   increase the foreign exchange earnings through improving cargo
handling operations at the ports, increasing the capacity of the
Suez Canal, and providing increased pipeline capacity;
(b)   improve the utilization of existing facilities through better
maintenance; and
(c)   improve the energy efficient and less costly transport modes,
inland waterway. and railways, to attract long-distance bulk cargo
movements away from the road network.
2.03        Under the Plan, the first phase construction of the port of El
Dikheila adjacent to Alexandria Port commenced under World Bank Loan 2183-EGT,
and the construction of the port of Damietta commenced with French financing.
The Plan included rehabilitation of Port Said, including the facilities
financed under the subject project and the rehabilitation of Port Suez.



2
Policy Context
2.04        The rapid economic growth which Egypt experienced in the 1970s and
early 1980s created a heavy demand on the transport sector. As a consequence,
the Government embarked on a program to expand and improve the road network
and to expand port facilities. It was recognized at the time of appraisal
that the over-riding constraint in the transport sector was the inadequacy of
the various transport agencies, especially in planning and operational
activities. In the case of the Port Said Port Authority, which was
established in 1980, these problems were judged to be very acute. Under the
project, the Bank and PSPA agreed upon a training program to be implemented
and the introduction of a supplementary bonus system similar to other agencies
to bolster its staffing and technical and managerial capabilities. It is
noted that improvements were made in planning and operations in all modes in
later years. In particular the Port Said Port Authority (the Borrower), and
the Egyptian National Railways made significant progress in improving the
efficiency and financial viability of their operations.
3.    Proiect Obiectives and Description
Project Obiectives
3.01        The main objectives of the project were to:
(a)   reduce excessive utilization of barges to unload general cargo
ships moored at buoys located near the eastern bank of the Suez
Canal and the shallow draft berths at Port Said;
(b)   increase port productivity by rehabilitating existing port
facilities;
(c)   improve the efficiency of port operations by providing modern
cargo handling equipment, and
(d)   strengthen PSPA's management including budgetary control,
planning, cost accounting, and internal audit through technical
assistance and staff training.
Proiect Components
3.02        The project at appraisal consisted of:
(i)   construction of a multi-purpose berth 250 meters long and 12
meters deep including dredging, paving, transit shed and support
facilities to handle mainly general cargo. This berth would be
constructed immediately next to and in line with the container
berth;
(ii) provision of two gantry cranes of 35 ton capacity for handling
containers;



3
(iii) provision of mobile cargo handling equipment for servicing the
multi-purpose berth;
(iv) rehabilitation of existing port facilities including quay fenders,
cathodic protection and electrical system; and
(v)   technical assistance to PSPA for project preparation (under a PPF
advance), supervision of civil works and equipment purchase, and
improvement of port operations and financial management.
4.     Proiect Design and Organization
4.01        Generally, the project was designed to provide additional and
improved facilities for the new PSPA. With the new 345 m container berth
already under construction under the first phase of the Master Plan for Port
Said port, the new 250 m multi-purpose berth would provide an adjacent
continuation of deeper berthing facilities with the capability of further
extension southward should the need arise. The crane rails for the gantries
were extended along the.multi-purpose berth so that the gantry cranes might be
used on either berths. The berths would also accept RoRo vessels with
sideport ramps or angled stern ramps. Bearing in mind the financial status of
PSPA, the scale of the project was appropriate at the time in the light of the
objectives, and was well prepared by the joint local/foreign consultants
partnership. Its timing fitted well sequentially with the construction of the
phase one container berth.
4.02        Initially, the stevedoring was carried out by the Canal Loading
and Unloading Company (CLUC), but it amalgamated with the Port Said Container
Handling Company (PSCHC) to form a private company, Port Said Container &
Cargo Handling Company, (PSCCHC) so that handling of containers and general
cargo are on a more coordinated basis. PSPA is an equity partner in PSCCHC
based upon its transfer to PSCCHC of two gantry cranes purchased under the
project. Any additional cargo handling equipment required will be procured
through PSCCHC's own resources. This has helped to maximize on the
utilization of equipment overall, and contributed to PSPA's ability to cancel
the procurement of support mobile equipment from the loan.
5.    Proiect Imolementation
5.01        While the delay in ratification of the loan by the Peoples'
Assembly did cause some modification to the project implementation schedule,
some of the necessary preparatory work had already been undertaken by PSPA to
minimize delays to critical project components. The design of the multi-
purpose berth had been proceeding under the PPF and after completion of
bidding and the evaluations, the berth contract was awarded on May 15, 1987
with completion scheduled for May 1989. Due to problems arising with the
driving and extension of the tubular piling supporting the berth
superstructure, completion was delayed until June 1990. However, the quality
of workmanship is good. Due to the highly competitive bid price, it was
possible for PSPA to cancel, with the approval of the Bank, a total of USS 10



4
million, part from the loan category and an element of the contingency from
"unallocated".
5.02        With regard to the two container gantry cranes, the contract was
signed on May 16, 1987 and the cranes were delivered and in service by
November 1988.
5.03        By March 1989, it became apparent to PSPA that, with the traffic
levels remaining low, the current equipment inventories of the berth operators
and stevedores would be sufficient to handle such traffic, and that the
additional mobile cargo handling equipment was not required, any additional
requirements for such equipment being met from the operators' own resources.
With the approval of the Bank, a further US$ 7 million was cancelled from the
loan reducing it to USs 20 million.
5.04        The subsequent fine tuning of project component costs showed that
a further reduction of US$ 2.67 million could be made and this was approved in
May 1991. The final cost of the project as of the present day is some US$
25.1 million of which the foreign exchange component is USS 17.15 million.
5.05        The cancellation of more than 50 percent of the loan was not the
result of inadequate review of potential resources and assets at the time of
appraisal. Rather, it must be borne in mind that, at that time, it was not
clear to what extent corporate independence of agencies or "privatization"
might be promoted politically within Egypt, and it was therefore prudent to
ensure that adequate provision was made under the loan to maximize the
benefits to be accrued from the project. In addition, it is unlikely that the
factors underlying the decline in traffic could have been anticipated at
appraisal (para. 6.04). It is to the credit of PSPA that it was able to
promote consolidation of existing assets and resources to the extent that some
of the loan was not needed and consequentially was cancelled. By reducing its
foreign exchange repayment commitment, PSPA has contributed towards reducing
the size of its annual deficit.
5.06        A significant contribution to the success of the project was the
capability of the joint local/foreign consultants partnership in preparing
suitably detailed bidding documents such that highly competitive bids were
received. While the consultants' supervision of the contract may have been
somewhat inflexible at times, they and the Taiwanese contractor worked
together well, and produced a good quality of workmanship.
5.07        The delay in effectiveness of the loan did not affect seriously
the timing of implementation of the project which was completed within the
designated loan period.
6.    Prolect Results
6.01        The project was successful in meeting its principal objectives of
reducing excessive utilization of barges to unload general cargo ships moored
at buoys near the eastern bank of the Suez Canal, to improve port
productivity, and to strengthen PSPA's management capabilities and systems.
Lighterage at the port has been eliminated, except for handling of dangerous



5
cargo and occasional back-up for sporadic congestion that may occur in the
port. Some of the barges are presently used for additional bulk storage.
Improvements in port productivity which were achieved under the project are
presented in Tables 6 and 7. For instance, the average waiting time for bulk
corn vessels decreased from 3.7 days in 1983 to 1.5 days in 1990; and the
average service time decreased from 26.8 days to 9.0 days during the same
period, even though the average cargo load for bulk corn vessels nearly
doubled to 48,000 tons (Table 6).
6.02        A well-planned MIS system procured under the project has been
installed in PSPA's newly established Information Center. The MIS system will
improve management access to relevant and timely port operating data, which
has been developed and maintained under the project.
6.03        At appraisal, dry bulk and general cargo traffic at Port Said was
projected to decrease slightly from the 5.2 million tons actually recorded in
1983 to 4.9 million tons projected for the 1990 and to 4.6 million tons by
2000. The conservative traffic projections were based on
production/consumption derived estimates of total traffic at Egyptian ports
with allocated traffic for Port Said taking into account the construction
efforts underway and planned for the Damietta Port and for the El Dikheila
port financed by the Bank (Loan 2183-EGT). Port Said's hinterland was
projected to consist primarily of three governorates, Port Said, Ismailia and
Sharkia. While the potential for transshipment traffic was recognized, it
correctly was not included in appraisal estimates of projected traffic.
6.04        Actual traffic at Port Said declined precipitously during the
1985-90 period. Dry bulk and general cargo traffic declined from 4.7 million
tons in 1985 to 4.2 million tons in 1986 and dropped to 2.6 million tons in
1987 (Table 8). Actual traffic in 1990 of 2.7 million tons represented only
56 percent of the appraisal projected traffic of 4.9 million tons. Nearly 0.8
million tons of the traffic shortfall was due to curtailment of cement
imports, while another 0.8 million ton shortfall occurred in flour and sugar
traffic. Actual general cargo traffic in 1990 of 0.1 million tons was nearly
0.6 million tons less than projected, while containerized cargo traffic of 0.2
million was nearly 40 percent below projected volumes.
6.05        The decline in traffic at Port Said reflects the general decline
in traffic within Egypt's seaborne trade. At appraisal, traffic for all ports
was projected to increase from a 1983 base of 28.7 million tons to 32.1
million tons in 1990, while actual traffic was only 22.8 million tons (Table
9). Reasons for the decline include (a) import restrictions imposed during
the mid-1980s in response to worsening macroeconomic conditions, (b) continued
languishing of exports, (c) slowdown of economic growth which averaged 8.5
percent annually during 1980-85 to an average annual growth rate of 2.6
percent during 1986-90. It is unfortunate that the worsening macroeconomic
performance coincided with the implementation of the project. However, it is
unlikely that the depth and length of the recession, largely triggered by the
decline in oil revenues and growing foreign debt obligations could have been
anticipated at appraisal.



6
6.06        The economic re-evaluation of the project produced an economic
rate of return of 16.3 percent, as compared to the appraisal estimate of 22
percent (Table 10). The lower rate of return is the result of substantial
differences that occurred in both project costs and benefits. Project costs
were reduced by 41 percent (in economic terms) from US$ 40.0 million to USS
23.5 million as a result of a highly competitive bid price obtained for civil
works (para. 5.01), the devaluation of the Egyptian pound (para. 5.04) and the
cancellation of mobile cargo handling equipment to have been procured under
the project (para. 5.03).   Project benefits, attributable to savings in ship
time, cargo handling and freight rates due to the reduction in lighterage
(100,000 tons in 1991) were still attained, albeit at lower levels than
projected due to the reduced traffic volumes.
6.07        There has been no adverse environmental impact recorded or
reported attributable to the implementation of the project.
7.    Prolect Sustainability
7.01        The virtual elimination of lightering activity at Port Said, the
principal project benefit, should be sustainable throughout the project life
as the facilities built should provide sufficient port capacity to accommodate
current and projected traffic.   There is a risk that due to the deterioration
of PSPA's financial performance in recent years that allocations for proper
maintenance of PSPA equipment and facilities could suffer.
7.02        PSPA's return on net fixed assets fell from 8.3 percent in FY 1987
to 2.8 percent in FY 1988 (Table 11). Little improvement was achieved in FY
1989 and FY 1990 with return on net fixed assets of 3.1 percent and 3.5
percent respectively, and preliminary indications for FY 1991 show PSPA
incurring a loss.  Other indicators of PSPA financial performance, such as the
operating ratio (64 percent in FY 1990), debt-service ratio (0.8 times) and
the debt-equity ratio (3.0 times) all demonstrate the PSPA's precarious
financial situation (Tables 11 and 12).
7.03        The worsening financial situation is attributable primarily to the
fall-off in traffic that occurred during the second half of the 1980's,
including the diversion of cement and wheat imports to Damietta port; the
increasing debt-service burden related to the construction of the container
and the multi-purpose berths; and the re-evaluation of assets acquired from
the Suez Canal Authority. The Bank and PSPA explored a number of alternative
measures to improve PSPA's financial performance including: (a) the
possibility of increasing existing towage charges, anchorage charges and rent
for leased land and buildings; (b) introduction of new port tariffs for
mooring and wharfage; and (c) reduction of depreciation charges to reflect
more accurately the useful life of assets.
7.04        Unfortunately, due to the need to remain competitive with other
ports and its desire to attract transit traffic, PSPA was not able to
implement any of the revenue increasing measures. However, the present port
management is committed to maintain port facilities properly and several
measures are presently pending approval from central government agencies that



7
could alleviate some of PSPA's financial concerns. These measures include:
(a) establishment of port tariffs in US dollars, which should mitigate the
need to regularly increase nominal tariffs to maintain port revenues at
current values; (b) revision of depreciation rates for port facilities and
equipment to be more consistent with the useful life of the assets; and (c)
commencement of a cost accounting system which will provide a basis for
reviewing port charges for the individual services provided on a periodic
basis.
7.05        PSPA has complied with or is in the process of complying with
those loan's financial covenants over which it had control. As required, PSPA
revalued its fixed assets, and undertook necessary studies to implement a
cost-related tariff system, and established appropriate accounting systems and
improved collection of outstanding payments due. However, PSPA was unable to
consistently meet the financial covenants related to financial performance
criteria, such as debt-service coverage and return on invested capital, due
primarily to the decline in traffic and its impact on port revenues.
7.06        The Loan Agreement included a requirement that PSPA "shall
generate for each of its fiscal years, starting with FY 1986/87, funds from
internal sources equivalent to not less than 35% of the annual average of the
Borrower's capital expenditures incurred, that year and the next three
following fiscal years". This was found to be unattainable in the case of
PSPA, particularly given the decline in traffic, PSPA's relationship with the
Suez Canal Authority, and developments at the Damietta Port, and the Bank
agreed to cancel this covenant.
8.    Bank Performance
8.01        In general, the Bank's performance was satisfactory.  Despite the
delay in loan effectiveness, PSPA and the Bank supervision missions were able
to maintain the implementation impetus such that the project was completed by
the closing date (with the exception of full implementation of the MIS).
9.    Borrower Performance
9.01        The Borrower's performance was generally good, apart from the long
delay by the Government in achieving loan effectiveness. PSPA were operating
in their earlier days in very restricted temporary offices while a new office
block was being constructed, and managed their operations remarkably well
under the circumstances. Their handling of procurement issues has been good
with few occasions where the need arose to refer problems to the Bank for
resolution. The delay of approximately 21 months in loan effectiveness
accounted for much of the delay in procurement of container cranes, equipment
for port rehabilitation and technical services (see Chart 2).
9.02        PSPA have endeavored to improve their income by taking over some
port activities presently undertaken by the Suez Canal Authority, but as yet
have had only limited success. They are proposing to use a Marketing



8
Specialist to promote the port's activities and facilities overseas. They are
however reluctant to increase tariffs at a time when such increases could be
detrimental to attracting new traffic to the port.
10.   Proiect Relationship
10.01       The relationship between the Bank and the implementing agencies
has been very good. There has always been a good level of understanding and
frankness, and all discussions and contacts have been courteous and friendly.
11.   Consultina Services
11.01       There were seven studies successfully conducted under the project
that called for use of consulting services (Table 13). Overall, while all of
the studies were delayed in their commencement and implementation, the delays
did not affect the timeliness or usefulness of their results. Rather than use
expatriate consultants and advisors to conduct the studies (and to conserve
their foreign currency resources), PSPA relied on local consultants (Maritime
Research and Consultancy Centre (MRCC) and Arab Maritime Training Academy
(AMTA), most notably) and internal staff (particularly for the cost accounting
study). PSPA are well satisfied with the calibre of advice and practical
recommendations received which were to a substantial degree implemented during
the project.   A need for a port marketing specialist to assist PSPA in
attracting transshipment traffic, which was not anticipated at appraisal, may
be provided during 1992.
11.02       As mentioned earlier (para. 4.01), the joint local/foreign
consultants' partnership for design and supervision of the multipurpose berth
performed well and with a good contractor, produced a high quality berth.
12.   Prolect Documentation and Data
12.01       The SAR was comprehensive and gave a good clear presentation of
the project as a whole.
13.   Findinas and Lessons Learned
13.01       Findings and lessons to be learned from the project are:
(a)   The delay to the ratification of the loan by the Government could
have had damaging impact upon the precarious financial status of
PSPA. However, with the availability of the PPF, it was possible
to obviate some of the delay with continued preparation of the
necessary designs and documentation for the project components.
Despite the initial delay in loan effectiveness, and further
delays due to berth construction problems, the time frame as
determined in the SAR proved adequate for satisfactory completion
of the project before the closing date of the loan (para. 5.01).



9
(b)   Loan cancellations, while generally not desirable, provided
flexibility which improved the performance of project by matching
facilities and equipment investments to revised needs
corresponding to the decline in traffic. It is unlikely that the
depth and duration of the traffic decline, caused by macroeconomic
factors, could have been anticipated during loan preparation.
(C)   PSPA is in a difficult financial position wherein some of its
lucrative cargoes such as cement and wheat are no longer handled
in Port Said, but have been diverted to Damietta or reduced due to
import restrictions, and port revenues have been constrained due
to the need to remain competitive with other ports and Suez Canal
Authority control over some port functions and areas.
(d)   The setting up of the MIS in Port Said under the project should
assist PSPA in improving the operational efficiency of the port,
and the utilization of a Marketing Specialist should help to
promote the facilities and services the port has to offer to
overseas potential users. The recent Gulf War did provide a spin-
off for Port Said for transshipment of supplies into the Gulf and
permitted it to demonstrate its handling capability for transit
containers (paras. 6.02 and 9.02).
Part II. PROJECT REVIEW FROM BORROWER'S PERSPECTIVE
14.   Proiect Obiectives and Results
14.01       The objectives of the project according to the World Bank
Appraisal Report were to:
(a)   minimize excessive utilization of barges;
(b)   increase port productivity by rehabilitating existing port
facilities;
(C)   improve the efficiency of port operations by providing modern
cargo handling equipment, and
(d)   strengthen PSPA's management including budgetary control,
planning, cost accounting and internal audit through technical
assistance and staff training.
14.02       The project was successful in fulfilling its objectives except
for:
(i)   shortfall of actual traffic at Port Said Port due to reasons
mentioned in the Bank's evaluation summary and Part I of the PCR,
and



10
(ii) strengthening of PSPA's management by technical assistance and
positive measures is currently in progress.
15.   Analysis of the World Bank's PCR
15.01       Factual information contained in Part III of the PCR are confirmed
as adequate and accurate.1
15.02       The analysis contained in Part I of the PCR is quite objective and
adequate.
16.   Bank Performance
16.01       The Bank's performance was satisfactory, and characterized by a
keen interest to implement the project as scheduled with the exception of a
few issues which led to some negative effects, such as:
(a)   The Bank's insistence not to award contracts to local contractor.
(b)   The prolonged delay in reviewing documents pertaining to
evaluation, selection and award of contracts. This caused
recurrent modifications in the implementation schedule and
subsequent delay in completion of the related project components.
(c)   The Bank's insistence on reinviting bids for MIS in response to
Compuland (a supplier agent) although their rejection was in
compliance with ICB and local regulations and the short list
included 6 pre-qualified bidders. Further, the mentioned agent
did not submit a bid and not issuing the reinvitation would not
have any effect on the procurement. The reinvitation caused (i)
delay in implementing the project and subsequently in making use
of the benefit of establishing MIS; and (ii) lengthy reiterated
procedures and increased costs either to the concerned companies
or PSPA (due to higher priced bids).
1/   The Borrower noted modifications to Table 3 which have been accepted.
The modifications were:
(i)   Table 3 (category allocation after loan cancellation) should be
modified to reduce the sum of USs 235,936 from category (2) and
added to category (lb) as it represents the procurement of fenders
for the existing Port berths.
(ii) The sum of USS 36,000 should be added under category (3) as it
represents the final disbursement to the MIS supplier made on
December 6, 1991.



11
17.   Borrower Performance
17.01       All of the Bank's field supervision missions have testified the
efforts exerted by PSPA in cooperation with the Bank for realizing the project
objectives successfully. This was demonstrated by:
(a)   Quick response to all inquiries, guidelines or advice provided by
the Bank.
(b)   Providing the Bank with the required data, statistics, information
and documents relevant to the project.
(c)   Efforts exerted by PSPA with competent authorities to carry out
the Bank's recommendations pertaining to: (i) revision of
depreciation rates for Port facilities and equipment to be more
consistent with the useful life of the assets; (ii) cost related
tariff study and establishment of cost accounting system; and,
(iii) facilitating custom procedures, particularly for transit
containers.
18.   Effectiveness of the Relationship between
the Bank and the Borrower
18.01       Similar to the Bank, PSPA has been keen to implement the project
as planned. Due to highly competitive bid prices, the low level of traffic
and the subsequent fine tuning of project component costs, it was possible for
PSPA with the approval of the Bank to reduce the loan amount in several steps
from US$ 37.0 million to US$ 17.33 million.
18.02       PSPA insisted on the use of the Maritime Research and Consultancy
Centre (MRCC) who proved successful as consultants for the establishment of
MIS and other maritime studies for which services were paid in local currency.
19.   Performance of Co-Financiers
19.01       The foreign currency component of the project was financed by the
World Bank through Loan No. 2569-EGT, whereas the local currency component was
financed by National Investment Bank (NIB). NIB demonstrated a full
understanding of the project objectives and implementation circumstances and
PSPA managed to match allocation and disbursement of payments by both local
and foreign currencies in a timely manner.
20.   Lessons Learned
20.01       Lessons to be learned from the project as per the Bank's
evaluation in Part I of the PCR are confirmed by PSPA.



12
20.02       PSPA would add from another perspective the following lessons
learned from the project:
(a)   Experience has proved the soundness of PSPA's view pertaining to
awarding implementation contracts to local contractors as the
foreign contractors utilized them as subcontractors of major
works. The local subcontractors proved their high efficiency in
all various works, viz: dredging, slope protection, precasting all
types of concrete, and steel construction works.
(b)   Availability of high standard local capabilities in the field of
quality control of piles and sheet pile welding.
(c)   Highly efficient project supervision was provided by either local
consultants or PSPA's engineering staff.
(d)   PSPA managed to organize the project working group consisting of
technical, financial, legal and administrative elements and as a
result acquired further experiences in these areas as well as
contributing to the group's success.

Identification:
The project was included in the updated Transport Master Plan by the Government in the
late 1980s. Under the Plan, the first phase construction of El-Dikheila Port and of
Damietta commenced. The Plan included rehabilitation of Port Said port including this
project. Bank identification took place in June 1983 and appraisal in February and
September 1984.
Loan Closing:
The loan closing date has not been extended. Delays in loan effectiveness and
therefore implementation were primarily due to the delays in Loan ratification by the
People's Assembly. However, this has not affected the Loan Closing Date.

Economic Rate of Return                    16.3X
Note: The economic re-evaluation assumes no growth in traffic volumes from 1990 through 2007. This assuiption,
which was also the basis for the appraisal report traffic projections, reflects that the Damietta Port is
expected to absorb anticipated growth in general cargo traffic.
a. Based on improved turnrround time due to reduction in Lightering of general cargo, containers and refrigerated cargo;                                  o
and average daily vessel operating cost in port of $10,000. Savings to Egypt of 65 percent of total savings based upon
100 percent capture of savings accruing to Egyptian-owned vessels and charter trade (35 percent of total) ard
50 percent of savings accruing to other vessels.
b. Savings of S2 per ton applied to reduction in lightered cargo and to container movements.
c. Freight rate savings of $1.50 per ton applied to container traffic due to elimination of feeder delivery.
