MEMORANDUM AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT
OF THE INTERNATIONAL BANK FOR RECONSTRUCTION AND DEVELOPMENT
TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS
ON A PROPOSED WOAN TO
THE ISLAMIC REPUBLIC OF PAKISTAN
FOR THE FOURTH HIGHWAY PROJECT
1.        The following report on a proposed loan to Pakistan for US$152
million equivalent is submitted for approval. The proposed loan would have a
term of twenty years including five years grace, at the standard variable
interest rate and would help rehabilitate Pakistan's principal highway (N-5),
and introduce important improvements in maintenance.
2.        Background.  Economic growth has increased the demand for transport
and required a more versatile and sophisticated response, met mainly by rapid
growth in road transport, which has now replaced rail as the dominant
transport mode and accounts for 80% of non-urban passenger traffic and 70% of
freight. The Sixth Five-Year Plan (1983-88) increased transport sector
outlays by 40% to Rs 53.0 billion, but an actual three percent decline in its
share of the development budget, reflecting increased priorities in other
sectors. Pakistan's network of National and Provincial paved roads has
increased from about 8,000 km in 1947 to nearly 30,000 km in 1983. The
network provides sufficient coverage but its quality is deficient and
requires improvement. Four of the major factors accounting for this situa-
tion are: (i? the rapid growth in traffic during the past 15 years,
(ii) insufficient expenditure on road maintenance and rehabilitation;
(iii) unresponsive institutions and procedures; and (iv) inappropriate or
obsolete construction techniques. The Government of Pakistan (COP) began to
address the needs of maintenance and rehabilitation in 1978, with the desig-
nation of 4000 km of main roads as National Highways to be the responsibility
of the National Highways Board (NHB), under the Ministry of Communications
(MOC). NHB began an extensive program of rebuilding N-5, Pakistan's prin-
cipal road (1750 km), linking Karachi, Lahore, Rawalpindi and Peshawar. As
of mid-1986, 580 km had been reconstructed to modern specifications.
3.        Project Objectives.  The principal objectives of the proposed
project are: i) to Lower transport costs on the N-5 Highway by road
rehabilitation; (ii) to develop the capacity of NUB to plan and manage high-
way maintenance and operation and to introduce modern technical and financial
management practices; (iii) to improve traffic safety on National Highways;
(iv) to develop the capacity of Pakistani contractors to execute maintenance
and rehabilitation works using modern techniques, equipment and materials;
and (v) to ensure continued adequate mobilization of revenues from road
users.
4.        Project Description.  The principal project components are:
(i) rehabilitation of about 650 km of the N-5 Highway and associated bypasses



-U,-
and bridges; (ii) improvements to the planning, management, and execution
of maintenance and traffic engineering on National Highways;
(iii) improvement of road safety through the establishment of a pilot-scale
highway patrol and expansion of the national driver instructor training
school; (iv) technical assistance and equipment for institutional improve-
ments in Baluchistan Communications and Works (C&W) Department; and
(v) studies for preparation of future projects. Training and technicaL
assistance form an integral part of all components. The project, to be
carried out over 6-1/2 years, provides funds for civil works, specialized
vehicles and equipment, training and technical assistance. The total cost of
the project is estimated at US$285 million, with a foreign exchange component
of US$135 million (48%). A breakdown of costs and the financing plan are
shown in Schedule A. Amounts and methods of procurement and of disburse-
ments, and the disbursement schedule are shown in Schedule B. A timetable of
key project processing events and the status of Bank Group operations in
Pakistan are given in ScheduLes C and D respectively. A map and staff
appraisal report, No. 6513-PAK, dated April 14, 1987 are also attached.
5.        Rationale for Bank Involvement.  The Bank's involvement in upgrad-
ing the N-5 Highway began in 1964 with a major upgrading and realignment of
the section between Karachi and Hyderabad. The creation of NHB in 1979 and
its working with contractors to apply modern road construction methods were a
radical break from the traditional practices of the C&W's and resulted in
part from the Bank's Third Highway Project (Credit 974-PAK US$50 million)
which rehabilitated 280 kms of priority sections of N-5.  The capacity of NHB
and the contracting industry has been strengthened and policy studies on road
maintenance planning and road user charges have provided the basis for
project policy agreements. As the only donor assisting the upgrading of
Pakistan's major highways, it is important that the Bank continue assisting
NHB and thereby help ensure that design and execution of road improvement
programs, including the training of local contractors, will have a strong
emphasis on technical and administrative efficiency in the use of maintenance
funds, which have increased significantly in recent years. The actual main-
tenance works will, however, be financed by the Government. The proposed
project would continue the Bank's assistance to the Baluchistan C&W, the
least capable of the four provincial departments. The proposed project and
the management issues addressed are an important part of the Bank's strategy
to assist Pakistan develop a transport infrastructure that meets the needs of
its economy.
6.        Agreed Actions.  The Government has agreed to the following
actions: () to establish a Project Management Cell within NHB by September
1987, and to employ project management specialists to assist it; (ii) to
implement an Action Plan for improvements to road maintenance including the
establishment within NHB of a Maintenance Directorate, and to inform the Bank
of its indicative planning figures for its maintenance budgets for FY1987/88
to 1991/92, both by December 31, 1987; (iii) to review and modify, as
appropriate, its system of collecting road user charges; (iv) to discuss its



MEMORANDUM AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT
OF THE INTERNATIONAL BANK FOR RECONSTRUCTION AND DEVELOPMENT
TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS
ON A PROPOSED LOAN TO
THE ISLAMIC REPUBLIC OF PAKISTAN
FOR THE FOURTH HIGHWAY PROJECT
1.        The following report on a proposed loan to Pakistan for US$152
million equivalent is submitted for approval. The proposed loan would have a
term of twenty years including five years grace, at the standard variable
interest rate and would help rehabilitace Pakistan's principal highway (N-5),

tion are: (i) the rapid growth in traffic during the past 15 years,
(ii) insufficient expenditure on road maintenance and rehabilitation;
(iii) unresponsive institutions and procedures; and (iv) inappropriate or
obsolete construction techniques. The Government of Pakistan (GOP) began to
address the needs of maintenance and rehabilitation in 1978, with the desig-
nation of 4000 km of main roads as National Highways to be the responsibility
of the National Highways Board (NHB), under the Ministry of Communications

key project processing events and the status of Bank Group operations in
Pakistan are given in Schedules C and D respectively. A map and staff
appraisal report, No. 6513-PAK, dated April 14, 1987 are also attached.
5.        Rationale for Bank Involvement.  The Bank's involvement in upgrad-
ing the N-5 Highway began in 1964 with a major upgrading and realignment of
the section between Karachi and Hyderabad. The creation of NHB in 1979 and
its working with contractors to apply modern road construction methods were a
radical break from the traditional practices of the C&W's and resulted in
part from the Rank's Third Highway Project (Credit 974-PAK US$50 million)
which rehabilitated 280 kms of priority sections of N-5. The capacity of NHB
and the contracting industry has been strengthened and policy studies on road
maintenance planning and road user charges have provided the basis for
project policy agreements. As the only donor assisting the upgrading of
Pakistan's major highways it is important that the Bank continue assisting
NHB and thereby help enr cp that design and execution of road improvement
programs, including the raining of local contractors, will have a strong
emphasis on technical and administrative efficiency in the use of maintenance
funds, which have increased significantly in recent years. The actual main-
tenance works will, however, be financed by the Government. The proposed
project would continue the Bank's assistance to the Baluchistan C&W, the
least capable of the four provincial departments. The proposed project and
the management issues addressed are an important part of the Bank's strategy
to assist Pakistan develop a transport infrastructure that meets the needs of
its economy.
6.        Agreed Actions.  The Government has agreed to the following
actions: (i) to estabLish a Project Management Cell within NHB by September
1987, and to employ project management specialists to assist it; (ii) to
implement an Action Plan for improvements to road maintenance including the
establishment within NHB of a Maintenance Directorate, and to inform the Bank
of its indicative pLanning figures for its maintenance budgets for FY1987/88
to 1991/92, both by December 31, 1987; (iii) to review and modify, as
appropriate, its system of collecting road user charges; (iv) to discuss its



-3-
highway investment plan with the Bank and take account of its comments;
(v) to carry out a training program for the staff of NHB, C&W's and main-
tenance contractors beginning "y December 1987; (vi) to undertake a provin-
cial road maintenance study with terms of reference and implementation
schedule mutually agreed upon; and Cvii) to review procedures and duties
levied on the import of spare parts for construction equipment.
7.        Justification.  The proposed project will provide direct benefits
to all road users in terms of reduced transport costs. Benefits have been
quantified for the road rehabiLitation component which accounts for 93% of
total project cost; the average economic rate of return (ERR) over the 650 km
:s 27% with a range of ERRs from 18% to 41%. The benefits of improved main-
tenance have been quantified ; overlaying with 50 mm asphalt concrete typi-
cally shows benefit/cost ratios between 4 and 6 on National Highways. The
benefits of the road safety programs have not been quantified, but in terms
of human lives saved could be significant.
8.        Risks.  Possible risks include inadequate or delayed COP financing
despite GOP's clear intentions to give high priority to roads, and poor
management by NHB.  To minimize the first of these risks, the disbursement of
certain categories of loan funds will be conditional upon GOP funding perfor-
mance; and to minimize the second risk, NHB has agreed to employ specialist
project management assistance.
9.        Recommendation.  I am satisfied that the proposed loan would comply
with the Articles of Agreement of the Bank, and recommend that the Executive
Directors approve the proposed loan.
