Termss             Repayment in 17 years, including 5 years of grace, with
interest at the Bank's standard variable rate.
Closing Dates       June 30, 1995
Proiect             The Project seeks to initiate a medium-term program
Obiectivess         for:  (i) improving CDE's operating efficiency through
the ii.&Flementation of institutional, organizational,
operating, and financial measures; and (ii) building
essential infrastructure in the power sector through the
rehabilitation of the distribution networks and of
thermal plants, as a means to improve service and reduce
losses.
Proiect             The project would consist of the following components:
Descriltion:        (i) rehabilitation and expansion of the distribution
networks in Santo Domingo; (ii) construction of
transmission lines and substations at 138 kV and 69 kV;
(iii) rehabilitation of thermal plants; (iv) technical
assistance in general man Sement, financial, planning,
technical and administrative areas; (v) training
program; (vi) consulting services for project
management, monitoring of coal contamination, the design
of the ash disposal system for thermal power plants, and
for the implementation of an accounting system
rehabilitation program; and (vii) refinancing of the
project-related PPF.
Benefits and        It is expected that the proposed project will help to
Risks:              improve the power sector efficiency and institution. The
project faces no major physical risks and entails no
detrimental environmental effects. Possible risks
include the possibility of less than expected
improvements in CDE finances and operations if there is
inadequate commitment on the part of the Government and
CDE to the project's objectives and lower than expected
tariff action. Appropriate covenants and an Action Plan
have been designed to minimize these risks.

II. THE ENERGY AND POWER SECTORS
Energy Resources and Consumption
2.1      The Dominican Republic's indigenous energy resources are scarce.
Oil exploration conduc':ed over several years and covering the major
prospective areas of the country hus not led to the identification of any
commercially exploitable oil deposits. Lignite reserves have been found
in the nbrthern region of the country, but their unfavortble
characteristics do not allow immediate utilization, although studies
continue to find economic solutions to their exploitation. The country's
hMdtoele4tr'c potential is estimated at 8,000 GWh per year or 1,800 MW
installed capauity. Only 25% of this resource has been or is in the
process of being developed. Although a few hydropower developments are
suitable, for future development, it appears that most of the potential
developm6nts are not economic at current international fuel prices.
Baaasse plays an important role among the renewable resources for
producing heat and electricity in sugar mills. Two bagasse-fueled thermal
plants, ,ith a total of 60 MW capacity, are under construction, which will
double the current capacity of bagasse-fueled thermal plants.
Geothermal rotential seems to be available in the central mountains, but
extensivb field exploration would be needed before an assessment can be
made on the possibilities of commercial exploitation. The country has a
significant solar potential which could be developed, though its cost-
effective participation in the energy balance would be limited.
2.2      The country's energy consumption in 1985 is estimated at 4.4
million tons of oil equivalent (MMTOE), resulting in a per capita
consumption of 0.69 tons of oil equivalent (TOE) p.a. which is low
compared with the Latin American average of 1.0 TOE p.a. As shown below,
the country is largely dependent on oil imports to meet its energy needs.
Oil impotts (crude and derivatives) in 1985 reached 2.16 million tons, at
a total value of US$427 million, which accounted for 33% of the total
country's imports, and 9.2% of GDP. In 1987, oil imports are expected to
account for 27% of imports and 6.3% of GDP.
1986 Gross Energy Consumption (Primary Energy and Imported Petroleum Products)
(In Thousands Tons of Oil Equivalent)
Quantity        Percentage
Crude OTi                       1,380              38.0%

TOTAL                           4.420             100.0%
The local refinery, REFINDOMSA, owned jointly by the Dominican
Governmeht and Shell, with a capacity of 33000 bbl/day, provides most of
the fuel products consumed by the country.



-4-
2.3      The degree of electrification in the Dominican Republic is
relatively low when compared with other Latin American countries. Only
about 38% of its inhabitants have electricity. Electricity consumption per
capita (CDE sales only) was about 370 kWh in 1986 (compared with 687KWh for
Panama and 857KWh for Costa Rica). For many years, the country has
suffered electricity shortages as a result of inefficient policies and
institutions and of the precarious financial situation of the power sector,
largely due to insufficient tariffs (paras. 2.41 through 2.44). As a
result of the lack of reliable supply of electricity by the Public Utility
(CDE) since the early 70s, there has been a rapid development of the
installation of emergency units. Their total capacity doubled between 1977
and 1985, and was the equivalent, by 1985, to 24% of the capacity of CDE.
Generation by these units is not known, but could possibly be as high as
25% of CDE's sales. Five large industrial consumers also have a generation
capacity which, in 1985, amounted to 27% of CDE's generating capacity and
produced the equivalent of 28% of CDE's own generation. The ferronickel
industry (Falconbridge) accounts for 73% of this capacity. In recent
years, due to a reduction of its own activity, it has been selling a
significant amount of energy to CDE, which in 1986 amounted to 1337% of
CDE's owa net generation. The National Sugar Council (CEA) has 62 MW of
bagasse-fueled units, and generates, mainly for its own use, the equivalent
of 3.8% of CDE's generation.
2.4      One of the main objective of the energy sector is to reduce the
country's dependence on imported oil. A substantial effort by the
Government is needed to establish policies for managing energy supply and
demand, including energy conservation and fuel substitution. A particular
concern relating to petroleum product pricing is the relatively low price
of gasoil, which tends to favor diesel-based self-generation, while self-
generation with fuel oil is discouraged by heavy taxes on that product
(para. 2.8). These issues are expected to be addressed by the proposed
Energy Assessment Study (para. 2.6).
Energy Sector Organization
2.5      The energy sector organization is shown in Annex 2.1.  Despite the
country's high dependence on external energy resources, its energy sector
is not efficiently organized. Responsibility for formulation of energy
policies, energy administration, planning and development, and setting of
energy prices are scattered among various Government entities and
institutions. The National Planning Office (ONAPLAN) is responsible for
national economic planning, including energy planning; the Comision
Nacional de Politica Energetica (COENER) is an advisory body to the
President of the Republic, in charge of planning and policies for the
energy sector (para. 2.6). Both ONAPLAN and COENER are under the Technical
Secretary of the Presidency, but no clear definition of responsibilities
exists.  The Instituto Nacional de Recursos Hidraulicos (INDRHI) is
responsible for planning, studying, and programming all hydraulic and
hydroelectric works and for the operation and maintenance of publicly-owned
irrigation systems. The Instituto Dominicano de Tecnologia, which reports
to the Central Bank, also plays some steering and advisory role regarding
energy resources studies. The Corporaci6n Dominicana de Electricidad
(CDE), an autonomous electric utility which operates the main public
service in the country and reports directly to the President of the



-5-
Republic, establishes operating and development programs for the power
sector and proposes electricity tariffs for the President's approval. The
CEA and Falconbridge are also important components of tne power sector, as
previously mentioned (para. 2.3).
2.6      In accordance with its by-laws, COENER is responsible for
establishing policies in: (a) generation of electricity in the country;
(b) rational use of indigenous and imported energy resources; and (c) the
utilization of appropriate technologies to develop the generating
requirements of electricity in the country. However, because of the lack
of clear commitments on the part of the Government, of coordination among
concerned institutions, and of sufficient specialized staff, COENER has not
been able to play its role adequately in shaping sector policies. In
particular, COENER has not been able to complete a National Energy Plan.
To assist in the preparation of energy sector policies and strategies for
the country, COENER has requested, and the Bank has agreed to s-upport, an
Energy Assessment Study, for which financing under the joint UNDP/World
Bank ESMAP program is currently being sought. The study would focus on:
(i) institutional aspects (planning and coordination between institutions
participating in the energy sector, sectoral operational procedures, and
institutional strengthening, including an evaluation of manpower resources,
ea . management, and training requirements); (ii) energy conservation and
s8.  itution programs; (iii) fuel pricing policies; and (iv) issues and
opti as concerning private self-generation.  It is expected that the Energy
Ase 4ment Study will provide recommendations for improving the sector
coordinatiori and efficiency, as well as a policy framework for possible
future Bank lending to the sector.
Power Sector Obiectives and Policies
2.7      Energy policies in the past have not fostered rational use of
energy resources, and have resulted in distorted fuel and electricity price
systems (para. 2.46) and power shortages (para. 2.36). The country's
objectives regarding the power se^tor are oriented towards solving some of
the most urgent institutional and operational problems affecting CDE
(para. 2.15) and meeting growing electricity demani with adequate standards
of quality of service. These objectives are to:
(a) strengthen the planning capability of the sector and implement a
least-cost power development plan t..at conforms with the country's
development objectives;
(b) integrally rehabilitate CDE's operations, with particular emphasis
on reducing distribution losses and improving thermal plant
efficiency;
(c) strengthen CDE institutionally, by improving its organizational
structure and managerial and technical capabilities;
(d) reduce the sector's level of dependence on Government financial
support, by increasing the self-financing ratio of the sector; and
(e) strengthen the sector regulations on environmental matters,
particularly those related to the operation of coal-fired power
plants.



-6-
2.8      The Bank fully supports these objectives.  Additionally, the Bank
believes that the setting of clear policies regarding self-generation is
needed. While the expansion of CDE's coal-fired pot;er plant is likely to
be the least-cost option to supply power demand increases, current
policies, in order to cope with electricity shortages, tend to encourage
self-generation through legal measures (see Annex 2.5), and a low price of
gas oil which tends to foster generation in private diesel plants. At the
same time, the price of fuel oil may discourage the use of steam plants
currently available in some industries. These issues, which involve CDE's
investment strategy, as well as fuel and electricity pricing, should be
examined by the proposed Energy Assessment Study (para.2.6). Execution of
the proposed project would initiate Bank involvement in the sector, in
which it expects to play an important role, providing technical assistance
on ways and means of achieving sector goals, while providing financial
assistance for CDE's investment program.
Prospects for Pri.vate Sector Participation
2.9      The Government is considering possible schemes which would
increase the participation of the private sector in the country's
electricity supply. These schemes range from specific projects based on
technical and financial studies (as the possible installation of self-
generation means for a free-trade zone project) to very general ideas
(installation of generating facilities by private investors which would
sell energy to CDE or would take part of CDE's current market). Under its
technical assistance programs, USAID is currently supporting the
Government's efforts to further explore some of these schemes. Private
participation may contribute to the soluticn of some of the most
outstanding issues of the sector as it could: (1) contribute to solving
energy shortages in the short term and (ii) improve the sector efficiency
in the long term. It is expected that the Energy Assessment Study which
has been proposed for the country (para. 2.6) would also examine the above
schemes in the context of the overall ana4ysis of the energy sector.
Bank Participation in the Sector
2.10     Though the Bank has not lent to the power sector, two Bank loans
have indirectly helped it by financing: (a) a power plant for the
ferronickel plant at Falconbridge (Ln. 646-DO for US$25.0 million, 1969);
and (b) a program to finance urgently needed imports after Hurricane David
(Ln. 1782-DO for US$25.0 million, 1980). The latter helped to finance two
30 MW gas turbines for CDE.
2.11     Under an engineering loan to the transport sector (Ln. 2369-DO for
US$3.8 million, approved in 1983), the Bank helped to finance studies to
improve power sector efficiency through the rehabilitation of thermal
plants, reduction of distribution losses, and control of environmental
impact caused by ash handling and disposal. Studies were completed, but
their results have n^t been implemented so far due to lack of financing.
The proposed project would provide financing to implement the main
recommendations of these studies.



2.12     The Bank also provided a Project Preparation Facility (PPF-089 of
US$0.44 million, 1985) to finance the execution of studies for the
renovation of distribution facilities in the country. Additionally,
increase to this PPF of US$100,000 was approved by the Bank in December
1986 to assist CDE in the financing of consultant services to prepare the
financial and eccounting data for 1986 and to review CDE's generation
expansion program. This amount will be refinanced under the loan
kpara. 3.5 (g)).
The Corporaci6n Dominicana de Elec ricidad (CDE)
CDE's Institutional Profile
2.13     The Borrower of the proposed loan would be the Corporaci6n
Dominicana de Electricidad (CDE) an autonomous, Government-owned agency.
CDE is the sole entity responsible for the generation, transmission, and
distribution of public electricity service in the Dominican Republic. It
initiated operations in 1955 by taking over the privately owned Compan.ia
Electrica de Santo Domingo, a former subsidiary of Stone & Webster
Corporation (U.S.A.). Since then, it has gradually taken over all public
electricity services in the country.
2.14     CDE is administerad by a seven-member Boatd of Directors, six are
appointed by the Government and one by CDE's labor union. CDE reports to
the President of the Republic, who appuints the President of the Board and
the General Administrator--the latter is CDE's Chief Executive Officer.
The Board regulates and approves major investment plans, borrowings, and
broad policies, and recommends electric power rate schedules to the
President of the Republic. External borrowings bv CDE require Government
and Congressional approval.
2.15     CDE's performance has been very weak, as reflected by poor
standards of quality of service and a chronically weak financial situation.
Appointment of key personnel, and investment and operational decisions have
been taken without sufficient attention to technical criteria. The main
factors contributing to CDE's poor performance are a lack of sufficient
economic and operational autonomy, insufficient tariff levels, the lack of
continuity of senior management and high level staff, and deficient salary
policies. Over the years, these inherent weaknesses have brought CDE to a
critical state, characterized by lack of clearly defined responsibilities
and objectives, inadequately qualified technical staff, insufficient
inve&tment levels and poor quality of service and public image of the
company.
2.16     The serious nature and extent of CDE's problems requires a prompt
start of corrective actions which would have to be phased in over several
years. To ensure the success of the proposed operation, during
negotiations, the Government and CDE agreed on the following actions:
(a) the Government would provide corporate independence and stability to
C!IE and allow CDE to set the level and structure of its tariffs in
accordance with the economic costs of providing electricity service
(para. 4.1(a)); (b) the Government and CDE would present to the Bank, no
later than September 30, 1988, a satisfactory Government/CDE agreement
(Contract Plan), with snecific performance objectives for CDE and specific



- 8 -
Government commitments including legal and administrative actions in
support of CDE, notably regarding tariffs, capital contributions, and
Action Plan (see below), (para. 4.1(b)); and (c) '.DE would satisfactory
implement an Action Plan (Annex 2.3) which would address the most critical
issues ih CDE'S organization, planning, operations, administrat.Ion,
accounting, commercial, auditing, insurance practices, and trairiing
(para. 441(c)). During project implementation, the Bank would assess
periodically the degree of compliance with the Contract Plan and the
progress reached in executing the Action Plan (para 4.1p)) as measured,
inter alia, by performance monitoring indicators (para. 3.18). A summary
of the most important CDE institutional issues, referred to in (c) above,
is presented below.
Organization
2.17     CDE's current organization chart is shown in Annex 2.2.  At
present, the duties, authority and responsibilities of key staff members
are not precisely defined. On the basis of a study prepared by Burns and
Roe (U.S.A.), CDE is preparing a proposal for an urgently needed detailed
review of its organization and structure and the identification of the
number and qualifications of staff required to carry out CDE's operations
efficiently. Implementation of a reorganization, in consultation with the
Bank, together with the implementation of a job description and performance
evaluation system which would include rewards/accountability criteria, are
parts of the proposed Action Plan.
Management
2.18     Poor management has been one of the most important problems in the
past. The turnover of high-level managers, usually appointed on political
grounds, is high. The increasingly poor image of the company, the lack of
competitive wages, and the opportunities offered by the economy's recent
growth have accelerated this trend. Managers have not delegated enough
technical matters to appropriate units, and have not been able to establish
consistent responsibility and accountability channels. Because of the
importance of a prompt institutional rehabilitation, CDE should carry out
the Action Plan with the assistance of a Management and Financial Advisor.
Thus, during negotiations, CDE agreed to: (a) appoint promptly but not
later than loan effectiveness, a Management and Financial advisor under a
two-year contract, with terms of reference, qualifications and conditions
of employment acceptable to the Bank (para 4.2 (b)); this position would be
filled until the Bank and CDE agree that it is no longer necessary.
Planning
2.19     CDE's Planning Directorate has not played an important role in
providing technical support and advice to CDE's administration on decisions
related to expansion planning and tariff issues, in part because of lack of
technical capability, but mainly because, very often, decisions have been
taken without adequate technical and economic justification. CDE has
received assistance from consultants for preparing expansion plans, but the
Planning Directorate was not sufficiently involved in the process, while
CDE has not trained its staff to discuss the conclusions of thaa- studies
with the consultants. Therefore, the transfer of knowledge to CDE's staff



has been very limited. Additionally, the position of Planning Director has
been vacant since 1984, and many professionals have left the Planning
Directorate. Within the institutional building effort included in the
Action Plan, it is expected that the organizational structure of the
Planning Directorate as well as its professional level would be improved.
During negotiations CDE agreed to appoint promptly, but no later than loan
effectiveness a Planning Director with qualifications acceptable to the
Bank (para. 4.1 (d)) and 4.2 (b).
Operations
2.20     CDE's power system operations are handled by the Production and
Operations Directorate. The Production Directorate supervises and
coordinates all activities related to the operatior. and maintenance of
power plants, and the Operations Directorate is in charge of the operation,
supervision and maintenance of substations, transmission and distribution
networks, communications, and load dispatching of power generating units.
The basic structure of these two Directorates as well as the professional
qualifications of their Directors and upper-level managers appear to be
adequate. However, the distribution of staff among departments, and the
qualifications of technicians and lower-level personnel need to be
reviewed. Additionally, the lack of clear definition of responsibilities
and communication within and among the two Directorates, and sufficient
training to keep staff up-to-date with new technologies and new
developments, have contributed to the low quality of service in the
country. Also, the excess number of personnel and low wages have caused a
deterioration in labor relations and an increasing number of strikes. It
is expected that the above problems would be solved in part through
implementation of the reorganization study (para. 2.17) being prepared by
CDE and by the training component of the project (para. 2.24).
2.21     In addition to the problems explained in para. 2.20 above, the low
efficiency of CDE is explained by insufficient investment which has caused:
(a) deterioration of the distribution and transmission networks, due to the
cumulative effects of delays in the installation of needed facilities;
(b) inadequate preventive maintenance programs both for production and
transmission facilities; and (c) lack of sufficient and timely provision of
spare parts for generating facilities. The result is that the supply of
electricity in all the country is poor and unreliable, and customer
dissatisfaction is widespread. The rehabilitation of the generating and
distribution facilities included in the project are expected to contribute
significantly in solving these problems (para. 3.5). The Action Plan
includes specific actions to improve the performance of the Production
Directorate.
Financial Planning. Accounting, and Auditing
2.22     (a) CDE's financial management is extremely weak.  Despite the
size of the company's operationa, there is no comprehensive medium- and
long-range financial planning. It is necessary to implement urgently a
budgeting control system to enable monthly performance evaluations. The
newly-appointed Financial Manager, an experienced engineer with good
knowledge of CDE's Lperations, would receive assistance from the Management
and Financial Advisor (para. 2.18) to rapidly enhance financial management
skills.



- 10 -
(b) Financial Systems Rehabilitation Program (FSRP). The
preparation of monthly financial statements is several months in arrears,
and the analysis of asset, liability, revenue, and expense figures has been
inadequate due to a lack of qualified staff and a high staff turnover. In
the last 10 years, recommendations for improving CDE's accounting have been
made by both consultants and external auditors, but CDE has not been able
to implement many of the recommendations because of the continuous
management changes. External audit reports have been issued with
increasing delays because of worsening tardiness and unreliability of CDE's
accounting records. The proposed FSRP would consist of two parts: Part 1
would reinstate all the normal accounting and control procedures of CDE by
June 30, 1989, to enable CDE to issue reliable financial statements within
30 days after the close of each month; Part 2 would review, improve, and
implement, as appropriate, CDE's financial management, budgetary and
reporting systems. CDE agreed to implement the FSRP with the help of
consultants, under terms of reference and contractual conditions
satisfactory to the Bank (Annexes 2.3 and 2.11). To ensure the accuracy of
the accounting of the proposed project the Executing Unit would have its
own accounting subsystem (para. 3.9).
(c) The 1985 audit report was issued in October 1986 and contained
numerous omissions and inaccuracies. New auditors, contracted late, issued
the 1986 audited statements on October 16, 1987. Because of the number and
nature of the reservations, the auditors' letter constitutes a tacit
disclaimed opinion on CDE's 1986 statements. To improve this situation,
during negotiations, CDE agreed too (i) engage external auditors
satisfactory to the Bank, and (ii) provide to the Bank audited financial
statements no later than nine months after the close of the fiscal year
1987, six months after the close of the fiscal year 1988 and four months
after the close of each fiscal year thereafter (para. 4.1(r)).
(d) Because of the urgency of the situation and of CDE's poor
finances, the Bank agreed to retroactive financing up to US$250,000 of the
cost of both CDE's 1987 audit and the implementation of the FSRP (para.
3.14).
Staffing
2.23     In December 1987, the number of CDE's permanent staff was 5,400
and 267 temporaries, distributed as indicated below.
Section                          No.
General Management               201
Comptroller                       42
Planning                          14
Finances and Administration      974
Engineering                      200
Production                     1,001

Total                        5 400



- 11 -
Total staffing has been stable between 1982 and 1986. Taking into account
the number of temporaries, the current customers per employee ratio, 102,
can still be improved. Also, the distribution of a large proportion of
staff among the various departments and their qualifications is considered
inappropriate to efficiently handle CDE's operations. During negotiations,
it was agreed that CDE's staffing policies would provide for a substantial
improvement in the customers per employee ratio, as reflected in the
corresponding monitoring indicators (see Annex 2.10, attachment 8). These
indicators would be reviewed and agreed upon with the Bank as part of the
review of the Plan of Action by September 30, 1988 (para. 2.1. and Annex
2.3) (para. 4.1(e)).
Training
2.24     Although training is a formalized part of CDE's activities and
numerous training courses have been held, their effectiveness has been
limited by the lack of adequately qualified trainers. Also, the number of
staff trained in critical areas such as generation, transmission,
distribution, design and construction has been low. To help remedy this
situation, the Bank prepared, with the assistance of consultants, a
comprehensive evaluation of CDE's training facilities and capability and
the ways and means to implement a comprehensive training program for the
whole utility. The proposed project includes a five-year training program
based on the consultant's report (available in the project file) which
would upgrade the skills of about 1,170 people through in-house and on-the-
job training and internships in overseas electric utilities. The proposed
training program is detailed in Annex 2.4. During negotiations it was
agreed that not later than September 30 of each year beginning September
30, 1988, until project completion, CDE would submit to the Bank a report
on training activities undertaken or to be undertaken during the year and a
detailed plan covering training activities during the following year (para.
4.1(f)).
Insurance
2.25     Insurance on CDE's power assets has lapsed because CDE was unable
to meet the premiums. During negotiations CDE agreed to employ consultants
to review its insurance policies and to promptly implement those
recommendations that are agreed with the Bank by March 30, 1989 (para.
4.1 (n)).
The Electric Power Market
Recent Trends of CDE's Sales
2.26     The growth of CDE's sales over the last few years reflects the
different phases of the growth of the economy: a growth of electricity
sales of 10.3% p.a. between 1975 and 1980 for a 4.9% growth rate of GDP,
and a growth of electricity sales of 3.9% p.a. between 1980 and 1985 for a
growth rate of GDP of 1.5% p.a. The growth of electricity sales has been
particularly vigorous since the last quarter of 1986. During appraisal, on
the basis of actual generation in the period January-September, 1987,
estimate of sales for 1987 were expected to grow by about 10%, after a



- 12 -
growth of sales of 4.9% in 1986. The trends of CDE's sales should be
interpreted with caution, since suppressed demand is significant (para.
2.28).
Self-Generation
2.27     The lack of reliable data on self-generation gives an inaccurate
picture of the global electricity market and limits the evaluation of the
potential growth of CDE's sales. Data on self-generation in the commercial
and industrial sectors should be collected on the basis of a systematic and
mandatory annual survey, as it is done in most countries. During the
negotiations, the Government agreed to conduct, through COENER, such a
survey no later than August 30, so that it can be used as an input for the
revision of the expansion plan (para. 4.1(t)).
Demand Projlections
2.28     The preparation of demand projections in the current circumstances
of severe energy shortages faces serious difficulties due to the lack of
reliable estimates of suppressed demand and self-consumption. Thus, the
growth of CDE's sales until 1992 will reflect the system supply capability
with the ongoing investment program and the results of the loss reduction
program. During appraisal, the supply/demand assumptions of the current
expansion plan were reviewed to consider: (a) a possible faster reduction
of technical losses due to a rapid implementation of the quickest pay-back
measures, such as the installation of capacitors by the customers; (b) a
conservative hypothesis for reduction of fraud; (c) a delay of about six
months in the schedule of increase of the demand of a major industrial
consumer, the Metaldom steel mill; and (d) the adjustment of the 1987 sales
estimated to be 4.42 above the forecast value on the basis of January-
September actual generation. The generation/consumption balance, based on
the present expansion plan would be as follows.

Sales would grow at 10.9% p.a. between 1987 and 1990 and at 7.9% p.a.
during the following five years. This takes into account a significant
increase of the load of the Metaldom steel mill between 1988 and 1990.
Without this special load, and excluding the additional sales resulting
from the reduction of fraud, sales would'grow 6.1% p.a. until 1990, and
7.6% p.a. thereafter.
2.29     These perspectives appear to underestimate the potential growth of
CDE's sales in view of the results observed in 1987 and of a possible
growth of GDP of 4.5% p.a., as well as oi the need to eliminate suppressed
demand and to limit further growth of small scale, non-economic self-
generation. Demand forecasts are discussed in more detail in annex 2.5.
Two scenarios involving alternative effects of electricity conservation are
analyzed for the period 1988-1990 and one of them is extended until 1995.
The two scenarios analyzed show that even with modest objectives of
increase of the electrification ratio, significant energy savings, and a
conservative hypothesis on the present level of self-generation, supply in
the coming three years is likely to continue to be very difficult. Until
1991-1992, given the limited possibilities of adjustment on the supply
side, reliance upon self-generation as well as a rigorous demand policy
emphasizing energy conservation and load management will be needed. The
implementation of a tariff restructuring (para. 2.47) that would foster a
more efficient use of electricity is, therefore, urgently needed. CDE
should rapidly revise its expansion plan to assess whether the
implementation of an emergency program to increase generation availability
is granted (para. 2.37). The revised demand forecast would take into
account the effect of the tariff restructuring and should be preceded by
the survey on self-generation (para. 2.27), to be prepared by COENER.
Power Facilities and Expansion Plan
Existing Facilities
2.30     The total generation capacity installed in the country in 1986 was
estimated at about 1,573 MW. CDE operated about 1,000 MW or 64% of this
total. Other 21% or 333 MW were large thermal plants installed for self-
generation mainly by the sugar mills and mining and cement industries. The
capacity of small units installed in the industrial, commercial and even
domestic sectors was estimated at 240 MW or 15% of the total. By the end
of 1987 CDE had a total installed generating capacity of 1,021 MW of which
206 MW (20%) were hydro. CDE's National Interconnected system, consisting
of 375 km of 138 kV lines and 1,090 km of 69 kV lines, links the main
production/consumption centers. CDE also owns all distribution systems in
main cities (9,400 km of primary lines in 2.4kV, 4.6kV and 34.5 kV and
1,820 km of secondary lines in 120V/240V). Annex 2.6 presents details of
the existing power facilities.
2.31     The Government owns hydroelectric plants constructed by INDRHI
(some of them are multipurpose) which supply electricity to and are
operated by CDE under no formal contractual arrangements. CDE pays the
operating expenses of these plants and a portion of the debt service.
Thus, CDE's operating costs are understated by the depreciation costs of
these plants which in 1985 were valued at about US$320 million. The
Government ani CDE agreed that proper accounting requires formal



- 14 -
arrangements on the ownership of these plants. Two different options are
being discussed: (a) the transfer of ownership to CDE as government equity
contributions; and (b) a long-term leasing contract between INDRHI and CDE.
The negotiation of such arrangements would be included in the envisaged
Goverrment-CDE Contract Plan (para. 2.16) and Action Plan (Annex 2.3).
Also, the Government services some of the debt with bilateral institutions
incurred to finance some of the plants owned by CDE. As a result, the
overall outstanding debt seiviced by the Government related to Government
and CDE owned plants, as of December 31, 1986, was about US$127 million and
has yearly service payments (principal and interest) of about US$25 million
(Attachment 10 of Annex 2.10). This amount is an indirect Government
subsidy to the power sector. The 1988-1990 financial rehabilitation of CDE
supported by this ioan aims at elliminating all direct subsidies from the
Government. It does not foresee the ellimination of the indirect subsidy
because of the large number of financial and operational commitments
already attached to the rehabilitation program covenanted under this loan.
However, if necessary this should be an issue to be resolved in the course
of further Bank involvement in the power sector.
2.32     CDE's thermal power stations (particularly Santo Domingo, Puerto
Plata and Haina) are very deteriorated and unreliable mainly because of the
lack of adequate preventive maintenance. They have been operating below
rated capacity and well below design efficiency. To remedy this situation,
CDE initiated a comprehensive major Thermal Plant Rehabilitation Program
(TPRP) in 1984 which, once completed (in 1990), will have covered 320 MW
or 42% of its thermal installed capacity. The program includes a complete
overhaul of the generating equipment, staff training on operating
practices, an overall coordinated and cost-effective spare parts program
and a well planned continuing maintenance program. The execution of the
program has, however, suffered delays because of lack of funds. As the TPRP
has been found to be less costly than the installation of new capacity, the
proposed project will help to finance the investments needed through the
purchase of spare parts, technical assistance and training (para.3.5).
2.33     Transmission networks  suffer from bottlenecks which impede
adequate transfer of the energy to the final user. Studies prepared by
Harza Engineering, (USA) show that substantial improvements and
reinforcements are needed in the short term to make full use of the energy
generated by new plants under construction and by the existing plants once
rehabilitated. To help overcome this problem, the project includes
financing for the construction of 62 Km of 138 KV and 42 Km of 69 KV
transmissior, lines and associated substations (para. 3.5).
2.34     Distribution networks are very deteriorated, especially in the
Santo Domingo area, due to insuffic!int investments, to inadequate
star.dards for the installation of network expansions and new connections,
and to poor maintenance. Sixty five percent of the feeders and seventy
percent of the distribution transformers are overloaded. It is estimated
that, during peak hours most of the feeders are operating with voltage
drops ranging between 10% and 25%, which is much higher than
internationally accepted standards (5% maximum). Frequency disturbances
are common. The poor conditions of the networks increase energy losses
(para. 2.36). Rehabilitation of the distribution system in Santo Domingo



- 15 -
would be the focal point of investments associated to the proposed project
(para. 3.5).
Quality of Service
2.35     As result of the problems described above, electricity supply in
the Dominican Republic is unreliable. Load shedding due to lack of
generating capacity is frequent. The frequency and duration of power
outages due to network failure are also extremely high. Customer outages
average 150 hours per year in Santo Domingo and up to 500 hours per year in
some other cities, which is about 50 times internationally accepted
standards. In addition to inconveniences, system disturbances and voltage
drop causes production losses to industrial customers and severe damage to
electrical equipment and appliances. Because of the unreliable and poor
electricity service customer dissatisfaction is widespread.
Losses
2.36     CDE energy losses are excessive.  This is the result of a
combination of abnormally high technical losses and of non-technical
losses, including all forms of fraud. The level of losses, as a percentage
of net generation, has increased from 23% in 1973 to 32.5% in 1986 (Annex
2.5). A study carried out by CDE's consultants Harza Engineering Co.
(completed in March 1986), financed by the Bank (para. 2.11) estimates that
of the total loss ratio of 32%, technical losses account for 20% and non-
technical losses for 12%. Technical losses are expected to decrease
substantially though the rehabilitation of networks, improvement of
distribution standards, and improvements of the existing distribution
system in Santo Domingo (para. 3.5). Also, a proposed IDB project would
contribute to reduce technical losses by rehabilitating distribution
networks in Santiago and 10 other cities. To assist in the non-technical
loss reduction program, CDE has obtained a loan from AID (US$3.0 million)
to implement a Revenue Improvement Program (RIP) principally oriented to
reducing fraud. The RIP would: (i) identify losses by areas; (ii) restore
to normal conditions all illegal connections; (iii) replace damaged meters;
(iv) set-up a periodic inspection program; and (v) establish a public
relations program to discourage fraud. At the completion of the project in
1994, it is expected that, as result of the above measures, losses will be
reduced to 18% of net generation.
Works Under Construction
2.37     Generating plants under construction consist in two bagasse fueled
thermal plants (60 MW total) and two hydro projects (the 25 MW Rio Blanco
plant and the 150 MW Jiguey-Aguacate plants which are being implemented by
INDRHI as, in addition to power, they have irrigation and water supply
purposes).   The capacity added to the system by these plants together with
the additional capacity provided through the rehabilitation of existing
thermal plants would hardly supply the potential growth of demand for the
next few years under acceptable reliability conditions. Installation of
additional thermal capacity is needed as soon as possible (see para. 2.38
on expansion plan). It would be difficult, however to advance the
commissioning date of large thermal plants because of the time required to
implement these kind of projects. In the short term, given the potential



- 16 -
demand in the country (para. 2.29), it is likely that power shortages will
continue to occur. To avoid shortages, the installation of emergency
generating units, possibly combustion gas turbines may be required. This
would be an expensive option that, given CDE's poor finances should be, to
the extent possible, avoided. During negotiation agreement was reached
with the Government and CDE that, by September 1988 a full evaluation of
supply conditions for the period 1989-1992 would be completed and, if
conclusions show that the system is going to suffer important shortages, bv
December 31, 1988 an emergency plan would be decided to restore the system
reliability to acceptance levels and financing means sought by the
Government (para. 4.1(s)). An annual follow up evaluation on the system
supply conditions should be made thereafter, in connection with the annual
review of the status of implementation of the Plan of Action (para. 2.16).
Expansion Plans
2.38     Investments in the power sector in Dominican Republic have not
always followed principles of economy and efficiency. During project
preparation CDE agreed to carry out a study, under terms of reference
acceptable to the Bank, to review CDE's generation expansion program for
the period 1988-2000 with the assistance of a consultant financed by a Bank
PPF (para. 2.12). The study concluded that the least cost solution for the
expansion of CDE's generating system is basically a thermoelectric plan
using biomass and conventional fuels (essentially coal), according to the
following sequence during the period 1989-1996.

Annex 2.7 shows CDE's projected capacity and energy balance for the period
1988-1994 with the current capacity expansion program. These balances show
that the total installed generating capacity is not sufficient to provide
reliable service. In terms of capacity to supply peak demand in the period
1988-1990, there is no reserve to allow forced outage of a large unit while
another unit is under maintenance. In terms of energy, the only possibil-
ity for CDE to provide the forecast energy in the period 1988-1992, is by
purchasing substantial amounts of energy from Falconbridge whose avail-
ability is not guaranteed after 1988 (particularly in view of possible
improvements in the ferronickel market) and by operating CDE's gas turbine



- 17 -
facilities well above economic levels. Under these conditions system
reliability will be extremely low by any standards at least until 1992.
2.39     Because of the financial burden imposed on the sector by the
required expansion of the generating system, it is important that the
sector adheres to least cost principles for expansion planning. To this
end during negotiations the Government and CDE agreed not to start any
generation project other than those envisaged in the above expansion plan
(par&. 4.1(g)).
Investment Pro ram
2.40     Investment requirements to implement CDE's expansion plans are
sizeable. The investment program for the period 1988-1994 amounts to a
total of US$1,145 million (excluding financial charges), in constant
December 1987 prices or an average of US$164 million per year. Of this
total, ongoing works account for 2%, the proposed Bank project accounts for
10%, and other projects for 88%. Details of the investment program for
these three categories including expected financing sources are given in
Annex 2.8.
CDE's Finances
2.41     CDE's finances, including historical and projected income
statements, sources and applications of funds, balance sheets and financial
indicators are analyzed in Annex 2.10, The main conclusions of this
analysis are presented below. In the period 1982-19861 CDE's financial
performance was extremely poor. Rates of return were low or negative (0.5%
in 1982, 1.1% in 1983, - 1.3% in 1984, -4.1% in 1985 and 0.0% in 1986).
The self financing ratio ranged from -12% in 1982 to -98% in 1985. Because
of a drastic cut in CDE investments, increased fuel subsidies, and the
implementation of the first sustained program of tariff increases from
January 1985 until March 1986, the self financing ratio improved to 6% in
1986. Since then, with frozen tariffs, the self financing ratio plunged to
an estimated -50% in 1987. CDE's chronic insolvency has required heavy
subsidies and Government support at levels which are considered excessive.
At end 1987, it is estimated that CDE had abouL US$8 million of liquid
assets, current liabilities of US$265 million, and long-texm debt (over 50
loans) totalling US$306 million. Current assets consisted mainly of very
high receivables equivalent to around 150 days of sales, and of mainly
obsolete, poorly controlled inventories. The November 1987 currency
unification (i.e., alignment of the official exchange rate to the level of
the parallel market) will deteriorate CDE's finances even further2 because
1/ Because CDE's external auditors tacitly disclaimed their opinion on
CDE's 1986 accounts, they may be subject to significant future
adjustments. However, this is unlikely to change the nature of the
above comments.
2/ Average exchange rates per US$ progressively declined from RD$1.12 in
1970 to RS$1.59 in 1984. There was then a sharp decline to RD$2.82 in
1985. On November 13, 1987 the official exchange rate began to be
unified on a daily basis with the parallel market which was then
fluctuating at around DR$4.5, reached DR$5.5 in January 1988 and
settled at around DR$5.25 on March 4, 1988.



- 18 -
foreign exchange requirements account for about 65% of operating expenses,
99% of debt service and 80% of investment costs.
2.42     Given the extent and serious nature of CDE's operational and
financial problems, it is clear that only joint actions by Government and
CDE can restore CDE's financial viability. Furthermore, it would be
impossible for CDE to successfully carry out an overall rehabilitation plan
without substantial strengthening of its financial management and prompt
rehabilitation of its accounting and internal control systems (para. 2.20).
Financing and Monitoring Policy
2.43     The Government has agreed to support the main policy objective of
CDE's new management; namely: to rehabilitate the technical and financial
operations of CDE to a level which would enable it to provide good quality
service to its customers at least cost without subsidies or financial
support from the Government by 1991. The Bank agrees with this target
date. Because of the yet uncertain value of CDE's existing fixed assets in
operation due to the uncertain date when Government-owned generation plants
operated by CDE) would be transferred to CDE's ownership (para. 2.31), the
tqorking ratio would be best suited indicator to monitor the adequacy of
CDE's revenues and rehabilitation progress. Normally one revenue indicator
w4ould suffice. However, in this case the self financing ratio is required
as assurance that CDE would continue to meet its contribution to investment
targets even if the Government decides to transfer to CDE the re-mainder of
the power sector debt currently serviced by the Government (about US$25
million p.a.) (para. 2.31 and para. 4 of Annex 2.10). The working ratio is
also required to monitor progress at frequent intervals during every year.
2.44     The following table summarizes CDE's expected financial
rehabilitation together with the main covenanted financial and operational
annual targets. They are related to the proposed revenue program and
current level of investments (para. 2.40) and will be a principal fact of
the performance indicators included in the covenanted Action Plan (4.1
(c)).

The above yearly incsaases of CDE's average rate are the result of a
gradual restructuring of CDE's tariffs in real terms (para. 2.47) applied
as follows:
(a) In 1988: In May 1988, CDE took a first important step ..f a tariff
restructuring process agreed with the Bank (para. 2.47). The
first step would be followed by a 10% average increase on
September 1, resulting mainly from the continuation of adjustments
to rates of the residential customers. During 1988, this
restructuring process is expected -o increase CDE's average rate
by 25% in real terms over its end 1987 level.
(b)  1989 and thereafter:  The restructuring process is expected to
continue with tariff increases of about 10% in real terms applied



- 20 -
every six months, on January 1, and July 1, until 1992. The
increases would be applied mainly to the residential average rate
to compensate for the evolution of the structure of sales (notably
the faster growth of large industrial consumers) which tend to
reduce the average rate.
2.45     During negotiations the Government and CDE agreed to implement a
program to rehabilitate CDE operations and finances by 1991. Section 4
(paras. 4.1 (h) through 4.1 (r)) indicates the financial covenants and
annual targets agreed upon regarding tariff levels, losses, operating
efficiency, accounts receivable and payable, Government contributions, and
reporting requirements.
Electricityjriciing
2.46     Annex 2.9 presents an analysis of CDE's tariffs structure and
levels as they were set by the time of the appraisal. The overall
conclusion of the analysis is that CDE's tariffs had many deficiencies and
an overall restructuring of the tariff system was urgently needed because
they did not adequately reflect the costs of supply and provided little
incentive for an efficient use of electricity. Residential and commercial
tariffs were excessively complex (i.e. for 1 kWh consumed in excess of
certain levels, the bill could jump by as much as 36Z - residential - or
69% - commercial). The charge applied co maxi--im demand in the industrial
sector was very low. Large commercial customers paid a price which is not
competitive with diesel self generation, while the subsidized price paid by
the 82% smaller commercial customers barely covered the cost of fuel. The
average rate for the residential sector (41% of CDE's sales) covered about
one third of the economic cost of supply under optimal conditions of
operation. Furthermore, while only 13Z of CDE's customers (or 5% of
Dominican households) consume more than 300 kWh per month, the price
charged for that consumption would have to be multiplied by almost five
times in order to match the cost. In fact only the 1.5% largest customers
who use more than 1000 kWh/month was paying a price that covered the mere
average accounting cost of fuel.3 The low level traditionally applied to
the residential tariffs is the fundamental cause of CDE's present financial
situation and the poor quality of service.
2.47     Aware of these problems, at the end of 1985, CDE prepared a tariff
study with the assistance of Electricite de France International. This
study provided important recommendations and notably a five year plan of
adjustment of the residential tariff which was not put into effect. As
correction of pricing distortions is the basis for the financial recovery
of CDE, during prepartion of the project, the Government and CDE agreed to
implement a tariff restructuring project appraisal mission worked out with
CDE a tariff restructuring project (Annex 2.9) based mainly upon an update
of the tariff study which main features are:
3/ With the repercussion of the exchange rate unification, 14% of the
energy generated by hydro, and not taking into account the fact that
the loss ratio associated to residential consumption is higher than the
system average.



- 21 -
(a) the introduction of a time of day tariff for customers of more
than 1200 kVA, which will improve the load curve;
(b) the reinstauration of the charge related to peak demand for
commercial customers of more than 25 kVA, which will foster
better regulation of air conditioning, and an increase of the
demand charge of the industrial tariff;
(c) the metering of the power factor and the billing of reactive
energy in order to reduce losses;
(d)  the introduction of smoother and simpler tariff structures in lo;
voltage (residential and commercial), wdhich will reduce customer
complaints and fraud; the unification of the various non
residential tariffs in low voltage; and,
(e) a progressive increase of the residential tariff, which will
promote energy conservation.
The restructuring aims at reflecting more adequately the structure of costs
in the tariffs and would be introduced in a phased manner so as to provide
incentives for load management and loss reduction. Its application is not
expected to involve unsurmountable difficulties due to the modifications of
tariff levels. The introduction of a new time of day tariff in high
voltage would, actually, slightly reduce the average price paid by the
large customers for whom electricity accounts for a significant portion of
production costs. The most difficult issue is the extent of the initial
adjustment of the residential tariff, which is the majer distortion in
CDE's tariffs. Despite this, during negotiations the Government and CDE
showed full commitment to the i-mplementation of the tariff restructuring
described above and agreed to apply tariff adjustments so as to obtain the
average levels discussed in para. 2.44 (para. 4.2(i)). In addition to
these tariff measures, CDE and the Government would initiate a campaign of
public information on the cost of electricity and an energy conservation
campaign.
III. THE PROJECT
Origin and Status of Prolect Preparation
3.1      The first mention of the project goes back to 1983 when the Bank
provided financial assistance for the execution of studies on the
rehabilitation of thermal plants, reduction of distribution losses and
management of coal unloading facilities (para. 2.11). Additionally, in
1985 the Bank provided financial assistance to prepare a feasibility study
for rehabilitation and expansion of the distribution networks in the
Country (para. 2.12). The studies, prepared by CDE's consultants, were
completed and the results were reviewed by the Bank and found adequate.
The conclusion of these studies were used as a basis to define the major
components of the proposed project (paras 3.4(d) and 3.5(a)).
3.2      In December 1985, CDE officially requested Bank financing for the
execution of the rehabilitation of the thermal power plants, rehabilitation
and expansion of the distribution networks in Santo Domingo, and consultant
services and training. A Bank preparation mission was sent to Santo
Domingo in October 1986 after which the government confirmed interest in



- 22 -
the project. An appraisal mission was carried out in May 1987 and a post-
appraisal mission in October-November 1987.
3.3      The status of preparation of the project is satisfactory.  A
feasibility study for the transmission lines and substations was completed
by consultants (Harza Engineering-USA) while detailed engineering and
preparation of tender documents are underway by CDE staff and would be
reviewed by consultants financed by the Bank by September 1, 1988. The
thermal plants rehabilitation plan was prepared by consultants (Stone and
Webster-USA) and preparation of technical snecifications and tender
documents for the acquisition of parts and equipment will be completed by
CDE staff by September 1, 1988. The distribution component was defined on
the basis of a feasibility study completed by Harza Engineering (USA).
Detailed engineering work will be completed by cor-lltants during the
project execution in accordance with demand grow.tA r"quirements as is
normal practice for this kind of project. The trairilig component was
defined on the basis of a master plan prepared by a fank consultant, which
is available in the project file. Terms of reference for consultant
services for detailed engineering work and project management are outlined
in Annex 3.11.
Proiect Objectives
3.4      The objective of the project is to improve the reliability of
electricity service in the Dominican Republic, improving CDE's operational
efficiency and restore its finances, through the rehabilitation of the
distribution system in the Santo Domingo area, the rehabilitation of
thermal plants, and the implementation of institutional, organizational,
operational and financial measures.
Project Description
3.5      The proposed project would include:
(a) erection of about 54 kms of 138 kV and 42 kms of 69 kV
transmission lines; 3 substations at 69/12.5 kV and 138/69 kV with
a total installed capacity of about 250MVA; about 295 kms and 835
kms of primary and secondary distribution lines respectively
(include 71 kms of new 12.5 kV lines and 224 kms. of
rehabilitation of existing ones); 60 lVAR's of capacitors; about
103 MVA's of distribution transformers; 135,000 service drops; and
protection and sectionalizing equipment;
(b) acquisition of all electrical and mechanical equipment for (a)
above, including meters, materials for service drops, protection
and switching equipment, tools and vehicles for project
implementation;
(c) purchase of spare parts and technical assistance for
rehabilitation of CDE's thermal power plants;
(d) consultant services for detailed engineering work, supervision and
project management, the 1987 financial audit, the Financial
Systems Rehabilitation Program and Management and Financial
Advisor;



- 23 -
(e)  training program and technical assistance in the financial,
planning, technical and administrative areas;
(f)  consultant services and purchase of instruments to continue the
monitoring of the levels of coal contamination in the Haina area,
and consultant services for the design, construction and follow-up
of the ash disposal system for CDE's power plants; and
(g) refinancing of the PPF (para. 2.12).
Project Cost
3.6       The total project cost, including physical and price contingencies
but excluding interests during construction is estimated at about US$120.4
million, of which about US$96.7 million would be the foreign exchange
component. Project cost estimates were prepared by CDE's engineering and
Bank staff based on a March 1986 study prepared by the consultants, Harza
Engineering, and on recent quotations received by CDE from manufacturers
and contractors. Project costs are estimated at December 1987 price levels
and include an average of 1OZ physical contingencies. Annual price
contingencies for foreign and local costs have been calculated at: 1% for
1988-1990, and 3.5% for 1991-1994. It was assumed that the exchange rate
adjustments would reflect the difference between internal and external
inflation. Import taxes and other duties are not incoluded in the above
costs because CDE is exempt from these charges. Details of the project
costs are given in Annex 3.1 and a suimmary is shown below:

Proiect Financing Plan
3.7      The total investment requirements for the -r.posed project
including US$12.8 million of interest during construction would be US$133.2
million.   Because of CDE's critical finances (para. 2.41) the Bank will
finance the total foreign cost of the project plus financial charges and
interest during the grace period of the Bank loan (up to US$9.9 million),
which add up to US$105.0 million. Local funds required to finance the
balance of the project cost are expected to be financed with CDE's own
resources. Under these assumptions, the project financing plan would be as
follows:

Organization and Implementation
3.8      Execution of the project would be the responsibility of CDE.
However, because of its lack of management capability and efficient
coordination among the directorates which would be involved in the project,
to ensure timely and efficient implementation of all the project components
the following implementation arrangements were devised:
(a)  the implementation of the action plan (Annex 2.3) for the
institutional and financial rehabilitation of CDE would be
executed by CDE's management with the assistance of the Management
and Financial Advisor (para. 2.18); and
(b)  the technical components of the project will be implemented by an
Executing Unit (EU) established within CDE's organization. The EU
would be headed by a project coordinator reporting directly to the
Director of Engineering, would be staffed with selected staff from
the Engineering and Planning directorates and/or professionals
specially contracted for the execution of the project and would be
assisted by a team of consultants. This unit would receive
support from the engineering, construction, administration and
finance directorates. The basic organization structure of the EU
which was reviewed by the Bank and found satisfactory is shown in
Annex 3.3. Before establishing the EU, CDE should prepare and
submit to the Bank for its review and comments a detailed
organization scheme of the EU, its manpower requirements and a



- 25 -
clear definition of functions and responsibilities. Because of
the importance of having the EU in place from the beginning,
during negotiations CDE agreed that the establishment of the
executing unit and the appointment of the project coordinator with
qualifications satisfactory to the Bank would be a condition of
loan effectiveness (para. 4.2 (a and b)).
3.9      CDE, with the assistance of consultants assigned to the project,
would be responsible for the detailed engineering work and project
management, accounting and supervision of the construction. During
negotiations CDE agreed that, as a condition of loan effectiveness (para.
4.2 (c)) it would appoint consultants whose qualifications, terms of
refereLce and conditions of employment are acceptable to the Bank. A
project implementation schedule which would be used to monitor the project
is shown in Annex 3.2. Project completion is expected by November 1994.
3.10     The proposed project is expected to be implemented in seven years
based on past experience with similar projects as reflected by the relevant
Bank standard profiles. However, it is possible that, if the project is
implemented efficiently, the implementation period could be reduced to five
years.

3.12     Procurement of all goods to be purchased under the project would
be carried out in accordance with the Bank procurement guidelines (Bank
Guidelines for Procurement, (May 1985)) as follows:
(a) materials and equipment for transmission and distribution lines,
substations, tools and vehicles, a portion of spare parts for
rehabilitation of the thermal plants, instruments for monitoring
coal contamination, and construction works would be procured under
International Competitive Bidding (ICB) for a total amount of
about US$95.0 million;
(b) a portion of spare parts for rehabilitation of thermal plants and
teaching materials would be procured through Limited International
Bidding (LIB), for an amount of up to US$5.8 million; and
(c) direct contracting (DC) would be used for procuring a portion of
the spare parts for thermal plants which must be procured from the
original manufacturer and payments of fellowships and other
training related expenses, for a total amount of up to US$5.0
million.
3.13     Procurement of consultant services for project management,
studies, training and technical assistance for a total estimated amount of
US$5.3 million would be carried out in accordance with Bank Guidelines for
the Use of Consultants (August 1981).
3.14     CDE has requested, and the Bank has agreed to provide, retroactive
financing for an amount of US$5.0 million equivalent for the following
urgent items: (a) about US$4.7 million for the purchase of spare parts for
the rehabilitation of thermal plants, (b) about US$0.30 million for
contracting external auditors to audit CDE's 1987 financial statements and
to implement the Financial System Rehabilitation Program (para. 2.22), and
(c) to finance the cost of the Management and Financial Advisor (para.
2.18).
3.15     All contracts, financed with proceeds of the loa-- for goods
estimated to cost the equivalent of US$100,000 or more wo.   be subject to
the Bank's prior review of bidding documentation. This would cover about
95% of the total estimated value of contracts. The balance of contracts
would be subject to ex-post review by the Bank after contract awards. In
bid evaluation, qualified domestic manufacturers would be eligible for a
preference of 15% or the import duty, which ever is lower; however, because
of the nature of goods to be procured local suppliers are not likely to
obtain a significant number of awards. Goods and services not financed
with proceeds from the loan would be procured under CDE's established
procurement practices which have been reviewed by the Bank and found
satisfactory (available in the project file). To expedite procurement,
during negotiations, agreement was reached with CDE on: (a) the use of
standard bidding documents for all procurement of goods under the Bank
loan; and (b) the procurement packages for goods to be procured under the
Bank loan.



- 28 -
3.16     Construction contracts not financed with proceeds of the loan
would be awarded using ICB procedures, except for a few small contracts
whose total cost is estimated at about US$1.0 million, that are not likely
to attract international contractors. For the latter, LCB is considered
the most economic and efficient procurement method.
Disbursement
3.17     The proposed project is expected to be disbursed over a period of
seven years. The disbursement schedule attached in Annex 3.5 reflects IBRD
standard disbursement profile, based on Bank experience in similar projects
in the region. The annual disbursement by project items is in constant
December 1987 US dollars is shown in Annex 2.9. Proceeds of the Bank loan
would be used to finance:
(a) 100l of foreign expenditures of the CIF value for imported goods,
and 100% of the ex-factory cost (excluding taxes) for local goods
for the generation, transmission, and distribution components of
the project (currently CDE is exempt from all import duties); and
1002 of expenditures for works;
(b) 1002 of the expenditures for consulting services (excluding
taxes); and
(c) Interest accrued on the Bank loan during its grace period; and
(d) Amounts due because of the refunding of the PPF.
The closing date would be June 30, 1995.
Proceeds from the proposed loan would be disbursed against expenditures
which would be submitted to the Bank and fully documented for contracts
valued more than US$200,000 equivalent. Claims for expenditures of lesser
amounts would be disbursed against presentation of a statement of
expenditures (SOE) for which the supporting documentation would be retained
by CDE for periodic inspection by the Bank. There will be no special
account in this project in view of the impediments which currently prevent
the Dominican banks from operating accounts in foreign currency. The
Borrower would be required to have annual audits for the project accounts,
and withdrawals based on statement of expenditures.
Performance and Monitoring Indicators
3.18     Attachment 8 of Annex 2.10 shows the performance and monitoring
indicators agreed by the Bank and the Government and CDE. They represent
reasonable objectives to be achieved during the implementation period of
the project. During negotiations CDE agreed to take all necessary measures
to meet such annual performance indicators. The progress being made
towards meeting the commitments established in the Action Plan (Annex 2.3),
would be subject to a formal joint review each year with CDE and the
Government. If the results of the review show that CDE is not in
compliance, CDE should agree to actions to restore compliance. If not



- 29 -
agreed or not taken, the Bank would have the right to suspend disbursement
of the proposed loan (para. 4.1(p)).
Economic Justification
3.19     Background.  The project would contribute to supply a rapidly
growing demand, to improve the quality of service, and to reduce the cost
of supply. The project is justified as part of the least-cost expansion
program of the sector's generation, transmission and distribution systems.
A measure of the minimum benefits associated with these programs is given
by the incremental sales revenue. The project, however, is likely to
generate additional social benefits accrued from expanded residential and
public use as well as additional economic benefits accrued from productive
use of a more efficient and reliable electricity supply.
3.20     Least-cost Studies.  CDE's generation expansion plan for the
period 1987-2000 is based on a study completed by CDE's consultant in May
1987. The proposed expansion plan, based mainly upon coal fired plants and
bagasse fueled plants, is the least cost solution to meet load requirements
for a wide range of values for the main economic parameters. The expansion
plan also emphasizes the rehabilitation of existing plants as a priority
for cost minimization. CDE's transmission and distribution expansion plan
has been defined on the basis of studies carried out by Harza Engineering,
USA. The choices of voltage levels, of conductors and of other technical
options involved (such as the location of capacitors) have been established
so as to meet the growth of demand, improve network reliability, and reduce
losses, in the most cost effective manner.
Internal rate of return
3.21     The Bank financed project is intertwined with - and is
complementary to - other components of CDE's 1988-1994 investment program.
The rate of return (see Annex 3.0) is taerefore calculated for the entire
investment program. Economic costs include investments in constant dollars
from 1987 and 1993 (including 2/3 of the cost of the Jiguey Aguacate
multipurpose scheme which will be paid for by the Government and operated
by CDE, and assumed to be the proportion of the investment in this project
for olectricity production purposes), as well as the incremental operation,
maintenance and fuel expenditures with respect to the values of 1987.
Benefits include, as a minimum, the value of the associated increase in
sales. If incremental sales are valued at USc 7/kWh, which is the expected
average tariff level after financial rehabilitation, the rate of return is
of 9.4%. This shows, in particular, that the average rate of USc 7/kWh
would be slightly insufficient to yield a rate of return equal to the
opportunity cost of capital, estimated at 10% p.a. However, if incremental
sales are valued on the basis of the avoided cost of diesel self generation
(USc 11/kWh) which seems justified in this case, the rate of return is
17.1%.
3.22     This evaluation of the rate of return, even on the basis of the
cost of diesel generation that many customers do pay, today, to guarantee
their electricity supply underestimates the value of a more reliable supply
from the network. For small users, for example, self generation has
obvious inconveniences compared to a reliable network service. An improved



- 30 -
quality of service would also reduce the cost of damages to electrical
equipments and appliances, as well as production losses to industrial and
commercial customers.
Project Risks
3.23     The project faces no major physical risks.  The construction
schedule assumed for the project is reasonable and takes into account
normal engineering, admini.strative and construction procedures. Delays in
project execution could arise because of CDE's lack of experience with
large distribution projects as well as with Bank loans and procedures. To
minimize this risk, provisions would be made to engage consultants to
assist CDE in project implementation. CDE would also be assisted by Bank
staff in matters related with Bank procedures. Project execution may also
be affected if CDE and the Government do not take all required measures to
improve CDE's management and finances. Also, given the large number of
commitments associated with the implementation of the covenanted Action
Plan (Annex 2.3), there is a risk that full compliance may not be achieved.
3.24     Although the conditionality contains remedies and a Plan of Action
to address this risk, inteaisive Bank supervision of the project and
decisive action in case of unsatisfactory performance by CDE are essential
to reduce the above-mentioned risk. Even only partial success in meeting
the ambitious objectives of the Project, however, would contribute
significantly to the development of a more efficient sector. Since the
project is viewed as a first in a series of operations designed to promote
sector efficiency, it is essential that the Government and the Bank monitor
carefully its implementation and, if necessary, don't hesitate to make
adjustments to the Action Plan. Follow-up operations would provide the
opportunity to take into account lessons learned from the first operation.
Project File
3.25     Annex 4.0 lists the documents consulted for preparation of the SAR
and processing of the present operation.
IV. AGREEMENTS REACHED AND RECOMMENDATIONS
4.1      During negotiations:
The Government and CDE, as appropriate, agreed on the following:
(a)    The Government would provide corporate independence and stability
to CDE, allowing CDE to set the level and structure of its tariffs
in accordance with the economic costs of electricity service
(para. 2.16);
(b)    The Government and CDE would present to the Bank no later than
September 30, 1988, a satisfactory Government-CDE agreement
(Contract Plan) with specific legal and administrative actions



- 31 -
which would ensure that the commitment of (a) above would be fully
implemented and enable CDE to carry out the action plan (see (c)
below) (para. 2.16);
(c)    CDE would carry out during project implementation and in a manner
satisfactory to the Bank, an Action Plan which would address the
most pressing issues in the following areas: tariff structure,
organization, staffing, financial management, accounting,
auditing, planning, administration, commercial management,
operations, insurance practices and training according to, inter
alia, minimum target monitoring and performance indicators
(paras. 2.16 and 3.18 and Annex 2.3);
(d)    CDE would establish inside its organization a Project Executing
Unit (EU) (para.3.8(b)) and would appoint and maintain a
professional with qualifications acceptable to the Bank and
specific technical experience as Planning Director (para. 2.19).
Also, the position of Financial and Management Advisor, is to be
filled with a professional with qualifications acceptable to the
Bank (para. 4.2(b));

DOMINICAN REPUBLIC
POWER SECTOR REHABILITATION AND DISTRIBUTION PROJECT
Training Component
Current Training Situation
1.       Training programs within the Corporation Dominicana de
Electricidad (CDE) have been formally institutionalized since 1982. These
largely on-the-job training programs have been directed at upgrading the
performance level of CDE's approximately 5,700 employees, and have been
coordinated by its training department. An average of 96 courses having
about 50 hours each, for a total of 14,836 hours were presented during
1984-1986, with a total of 4,128 participants including those participating
in more than one course and thus double counted. Despite these seemingly
impressive raw numbers the programs have failed to provide adequate
training to the staff because: (a) only about 30% of the total
participation in courses was from the technical divisions; (b) only about
10% of all participants were in technical courses in power generation and
transmission-distribution or in system planning and engineering design -
construction supervision; and (c) the majority of the engineering and
technician level personnel who also serve as instructors in nearly all of
the technical courses are not technically qualified themselves.
2.       The result of the above deficiencies is a low level of staff
proficiency in power system planning, operation and maintenance. Managers
at all levels are well aware of the deficiencies in technical management
capabilities and the resulting low level of performance of the system as a
whole, and there is a strong interest in improved and expanded training
programs with adequate participation of engineering and operational staff.
Preparation of the Training Component
3.       With Bank assistance, the division directors and their major
department heads, and under the coordination of the Training Depattment,
have planned a five-year training program which would help CDE in improving
its operational and financial performance (see attachment) and
organizational structure by: (a) strengthening and formalizing the system-
wide planning process for more effective on-the-job and off-the-job
training programs; (b) greatly increasing the participation of technical
division's personnel in formalized on-the-job (theory and practice)
training; (c) improving the technical capabilities of on-the-job
instructional personnel, especially in the technical divisions; (d)
increasing the number of technical and other key personnel participating in
effective study tours/internships in appropriate power systems abroad; and
(e) significantly increasing the number of highly qualified specialists
from abroad who function both in a technical capacity and in a on-the-job
trainer capacity in their respective areas of expertise. The proposed
program for 1988-1992 would provide for about 134 people to participate in
short study tours/internships in appropriate electric power systems abroad
for a total of 233 months. Some 1,170 employees (68Z from technical



- 40 -
ANNEX 2.4
Page 2 of 5
divisions) would participate in about 156 on-the-job training courses.
About 29 technically specialist from abroad would be recruited for a total
of about 41 months to provide assistance in the overall CDE system
planning, operation and maintenance and, at the same time assist in the
development and initial implementation of on-the-job training courses.
The Training Committee
4.       A formal "training planning committee" for the development of
training policy and goals would be required to ensure the successful
implementation of the training program. It would consist of the directors
of the five major operational divisions and the training department. An ad
hoc form of this committee took the lead in planning the training and
Technical Assistance needs for the proposed project.
Obiectives of the Training Component
5.       The main objectives of the training and tezhnical assistance
component would be to:
(a) provide short and intensive study tours and internships abroad for
an estimated 134 persons;
(b) upgrade about 1,170 persons through in-service "on-the-job' and
in-service "off-the-job" training courses;
(c) provide specialist services for a total of 41 person-month;
(d) create a formal "training policy and planning committee"
consisting of the five major directors and the head of the
training department, for the development of training policy and
training priorities and goals;
(e) increase the quality and technical relevance of training course
content; and
(f) improve trainees motivation and training effectiveness.
Description of the Training Component
Courses and Fellowships
6.       Table 1, (Annex 2.4, Attachment 1) shows the number of personnel
to be trained abroad and a tentative schedule, while details of expartriate
specialist requirements by areas of specializations are given in Table 2
(Annex 2.4, Attachment 1). Table 1 shows the priority for study
tours/internships abroad is given to key personnel in technical divisions.
Of the 134 training opportunities abroad (average 2.5 months each), about
622 would be in the first year, reflecting the urgent need for improved
technical competencies for use in the power system operations and to
initiate, with the assistance of foreign specialists, improved technical
course instruction. Table 2, clearly shows that high priority should be
placed upon the early recruitment of the required specialists. Terms of
reference for the recruitment of these specialists should be prepared by



- 41 -
ANNEX 2.4
Page 3 of 5
CDE and presented to the Bank for review and comment and agreed upon
during negotiations. Priority training courses will be promptly initiated
in late 1988, and they would be almost entirely of the "on-the-job" type
(see Table 3, (Annex 2.4, Attachment 1)), and would consist of both
technical theory and technical practice.
Training Facilities, Equipment and Materials
7.       Because nearly all of the training for the technical divisions
would take place in their respective facilities, or in the field, or at
actual job sites, only a minimal amount (60 sq. mts.) *,f additional space
is needed for the training department which is available in CDE's building.
Training equipment and materials in the amount of about US$200,000 would be
acquired under the project.
Training Policy Development. Planning and Coordination
8.       The development of trainiag policy and planning which would be
carried out would be a 'Training Planning Committee" consisting of the five
major operational divisions' directors and the head of the Training
Department and his coordinators of instruction and of programming and
evaluation. Day to day coordination of training and the provision of
support services would be provided by the Training Department.
Training Program, Development and Implementation
9.       Training program development and presentation would be largely the
responsibility of the technical division staff, with the assistance of
expatriate specialists. Course content would be based upon the detailed
training and/or repair manuals developed by the manufacturers of the power
system equipment and from on-going occupational analyses made by staff and
consultants. The technical courses would be taught by technical staff
upgraded abroad under the project, with assistance in the initial courses
by expatriate specialists. As these courses would nearly always be taught
on-the-job and during normal working hours, no extra instructor fees would
be required. Most of the non-technical courses would be taught by part-
time instructors from outside CDE. A follow-up study to assess strengths
and weaknesses of the training courses would be carried out by the training
departments coordinator of programming and evaluation.
Cost of Training and Technical Assistance Component
10.      The total investment cost of the training and technical assistance
component including price contingencies is estimated at US$1.58 million of
which US$1.13 million is foreign cost. Detailed costs are shown in Table 4
(Annex 2.4, Attachment 1).

Self Generation
2.       Self generation plays an important role in the Dominican Power
market. In view of the growing electricity shortage, Law 570 of October
1973 granted a special exemption from import duties for standby units, and
Decree 1613 of January 1976 stipulates that ell new companies requiring
more than 8000 kWh of demand should have their own generating facilities,
without which the operation of these companies would not be authorized, a
rather unusual text, which, although applied with flexibility, seems to
recognize CDE's inability to fulfill its role as defined in the
nationalization law and in CDE's organic law. Damages caused by hurricane
David have been an additional factor in the development of standby units in
197o-1980.
3.       There are six major autoproducerst the National Sugar Council
(CEA, 62 MW), the Falconbridge plant (ferronickel, 198 MW) and four other
plants (73 MW) of which two cement plants. The installed capacity and
generation of these six autoproducers are given in tables 4 and 5.
Together, they accounted for 333 MW of installed capacity in 1985 (one
third of CDE's capacity), and for a generation of 973 GWh (one third of
CDE's generation). CEA (sugar industry) consumes most of its own
generation which is equivalent to 93 of CDE's non-residential sales, and
plans to increase its'capacity by 60 MW in 1990-1901. Self consumption by
the five other producers was estimated at about 472 of CDE's non-
residential sales in 1985. Since 1982, due to a depressed market for
ferronickel, Falconbridge sold an increasing share of its generation to
CDE; in 1986 these purchases amounted to 13.7Z of CDE's own generation, but
this precious source of power is vulnerable to the fluctuations of the
world ferronickel market.
4.       The capacity of other emergency units, calculated on the basis of
applications for import duty exemptions since 1973, has doubled between
1977 and 1985 ( a growth of 9.4Z p.a.) and was about 240MW in 1985 (see
table 3), that is, 242 of CDE's capacity. COENER estimates the generation
of these plants (on the basis of 300 hours of outage per year and an
availability ratio of 752), at 54 GWh or 2.32 of CDE's total sales. This
figure could largely underestimate the amount of self generation since,
once these units are installed it is cheaper to run them at a cost of RD$
18.6/kWh (RD$ 2.5 per gallon of diesel oil in 1987), than to purchase from
CDE (for example RD$ 39/kWh for the commercial sector). If 502 of the
capacity of these units is used 50Z of the time, total generation would be
of 525 GWh, or 40Z of CDE's non residential sales. In that case total
self-consumption excluding the sugar industry for which self-generation is
a well Justified option, would amount to the equivalent of 172 of CDE's non
residential sales.
5.       The lack of reliable data on self-generation gives an innacurate
picture of the global electricity market and limits the evaluation of the
potential growth of CDE's sales. A self-consumption of autoproducers
(sugar industry excluded) almost equivalent to CDE's non-residential sales
is not at all impossible. Data on self generation in the commercial and
industrial sectors should be collected by COENER on the basis of a
systematic and mandatory annual survey, as is done in most countries.

Demand Forecasts
6.       Table 6 summarizes the sales and generation forecasts associated
to the current expansion plan which was prepared in early 1987, largely
based upon the demand forecast of a study of 1986. Stles for 1987 are
likely to be 4.42 above the forecast of the expansion plan. The profile of
non-technical loss reduction (fraud), although adequate as an objective,
seems somewhat optimistic for a prudent forecast, (the consequences of a
variation of non technical losses are, mainly financial, however). On the
other hand the reduction of technical lusses could be somewhat faster in
the first years with a rapid implementation of the quickest pay-back
measures, such as the installation of capacitors by the customers
(introduction of a power factor penalty for industrial and commercial
customers, to be applied, in 19b8, to all customers of more than 250 kVA).
7.       Table 7 gives an adjusted sales/generation balance, with values of
net generation close to those of the expansion plan but with 1987 values
adjusted according to the trend observed until September, an adjusted loss
reduction profile, and a delay of six months in the schedule of increase of
the Hetaldom load.
This would imply the following rates of growth:
86-87     88-90      91-92    93-95
Consumrtioh without
Metaldcm and without
Fraud Reduction              7.62       5.9        7.02     7.72
Sales with Metaldom and
With Fraud Reduc.            7.6       10.92       7.72     7.9t
Total Losses                11.02      -3.52      -2.82    +1.12
Net generation               8.62       6.72       5.3Z     6.62
8.       Given that the expected economic growth for the next five years
(4.5Z growth of GDP) is about the same as the 1986-87 average, the growth
of sales without Metaldom and without the effect of fraud reduction until
1990 seems only compatible with a minimal increase of the electrification
of the country, a continued growth of self generation, and the worsening of
the quality of service. The only alternative available in the short term
would be a vigorous demand management policy, based in particular on a
significant price increase for large residential consumptions (300 kWh and
more) which correspond to the use of air conditioning, and are, today,
highly subsidized.
Scenarios
9.       To test the implications, on the demand side, of the supply that
would be available with the current expansion plan, a simple simulation
model has been developed. It emphasizes the following set of variables:
- number of connections per year;
- residential consumption per customer;
-  industrial and commercial GDP and elasticity of non-residential
consumption (CDE sales & self-consumption) to this component of
GDP;
- fraud and technical losses reduction objectives and growth of
self-generation (the latter can be interpreted as the amount of
suppressed demand since diesel generation is much more
expensive than network supply).



- 47 -
Annex 2.5
Page 4 of 1l
Self-consumption is not well known, let alone by sector; one has assumed
conservatively that, in 1987, self consumption was the equivalent of 502 of
CDE's non residential sales (755 GWh, sugar industry excluded), with a
sensitivity analysis assuming self-consumption equal to 2/3 of CDE's non-
residential sales, or 1000 GWh. The growth of self-consumption is deducted
from the growth of total non residential comsumption (self-consumption
included) and the growth of CDE's sales as allowed by CDE's planned
generation, or, alternatively, when the supply constraint is released, the
growth of CDE's non residential sales can be derived from the growth of non
residential consumption and an assumption on the growth of self-
consumption.
10.      Two scenarios are detailed in Tables 8 and 9.  In both scenarios
the loss ratios (technical and non technical) are the same as those of
table 7. A reduction of fraud of 100 kWh is assumed to translate into 40
kWh of additional residential sales, and 40 KWh of non residential sales.
Period 1988-1990
11.      In both scenarios GDP is assumed to grow at 4.52 p.a., commercial
and industrial GDP at 5.5Z p.a. and non residential electricity consumption
at 6.6Z p.a. Net generation capabilities are considered as given.
Scenario A: corresponds to moderate incentives for energy
conservation in the residential sector. Average consumption per
residential customer grows at an average of 1.9Z p.a. between 1987
and 1990 instead of 2.9Z p.a. between 1985 and 1987. 20,000
customers are connected each year and the electrification ratio in
1990 is increased by 2.6 points compared to 1985, against an
increase of 5.6 points between 1980 and 1985. Residential sales
without fraud reduction grow at 5.6Z p.a. instead of 8.9% in
1986-87 in spite of a similar increase of the number of customers.
CDE's non residential sales grow at 6.72 (without Metaldom and
Loss Recovery). Self generation grows at 6.42 p.a.
-       Scenario B: corresponds to a vigorous price policy in the
residential sector accompanied by energy conservation campaigns.
30,000 customers are connected anually until 1990 instead of
20,000. Consumption per customer in 1990 is 1OZ below that of
scenaric A for 20,000 connections per year and the 25,000
additional customers by mid 1990 are assumed to consume 1000
kWh/year. Residential consumption grows at an average rate of
2.82 between 1987 and 1990, with a reduction of some 62 in 1988.
CDE's non residential sales grow at 8.12 (without Metaldom and
loss recovery) and self generation at 2.3Z (or 3.22 if it amounts
to 1000 CWh in 1987), which indicates, still, a very difficult
situation.
The difference between the two scenarios in 1990 is:
-30,000 additional households with electricity.
-self generation reduced by 100 GWh which means annnual savings of
US$ 4.2 million in diesel oil with a CIF price of US$ 173/ton, and
savings in investment in about 50MW of diesel units or US$ 36
million; total savings on self generation over the three years
would amount to more than US$44 million.



- 48 -
Annex 2.5
Page 5 of 10
-an increase in CDE's revenue from the residential sector due
mainly to the price effect, higher sales and revenue from non
residential users due to less self-generation:
-a little more effort by large residential customers to control

-a better quality of service.
Period 1990 - 1995
12.      The ex.ension of scenario B until 1995 is presented in table 9.
As before, until 1990 included sales are constrained by the levels of
generation of the current expansion plan. After 1990 the generation
constraint is released, and it is assumed that self generation and /or
suppressed demand to remain at the 1990 level. The number of annual
connections increases from 30,000 until 1990, to 35,000 in 1991-1992 and to
45,000 from 1992 to 1995. The growth of self generation and of CDE's non
residential sales (without loss reduction) are summarized below for two
hypotheses of self generation in 1987 (755 GWh and 1000 GWh)
Self generation 755 GWH in 1987   1987-1990  1990-1992  1992-1995
Self generation                    2.32      0.02        0.02
CDE nqn residential sales          8.62      9.1Z        8.4Z
CDE total sales w.o. Metaldom
-and fraud reduction             6.12      8.2Z        8.0Z
CDE Net generation                 6.72      6.22        6.82
Self generation 1000 GWh in 1987
Self generation                    3.4Z      O.OZ        0.02
CDE non residential sales          8.6Z     10.02        9.12
CDE total sales w.o. Metaldom
and fraud reduction              6.12      8.8%        8.52
CDE Net generation                 6.72      6.7Z        7.22
It shoidld be recalled that these figures assume a significant effect of
energ- conservation in the residential sector. Furthermore one should
should hope a slight reduction of self-consumption, suppressed demand
rather than a mere stability. Overall, then, a growth of CDE's generation
at 7Z or 82 p.a. between 1990 and 1995 would not be unrealistic.
Possible Improvements in Demand Forecasting
13.      CDE's demand forecasting could be improved in many ways.  A first
area of potential improvement concerns the data. There is a need for
issuing statistics with a more relevant classification for market and
economic analysis, and with an adequate correspondence between sales data
and indicators of economic activity (the present clasification emphasizes
government or private ownership, rather than the type of activity).
Customer records should indicate the SIC code whereas, today, only the
tariff code is available. When reclassifications or changes in the
definition of the data occur, homogeneous historical series should be

Annex 2.5
Page 6 of 10
reconstructed. The reclassifications made in the past (transfers from
industry to Government) make it very difficult to attempt a sectoral
analysis with more than two sectors (residential, non-residential).
Precise methods for estimating the consumption of public lighting should be
developed. There is an urgent need for more relial-le and more systematic
data on self-generation because CDE's sales forecaw% should start, first,
from a forecast of the total electricity requiremen:s of the country.
Surveys on appliance saturation ratios in the residential sector should be
developed. Load research at customer or distribution transformer levels
should be developed to '.mprove the forecast of the load curve and for
tariff studies.
14.      As pointed out by the consultant's report on the expansion plan,
CDE's forecasts are based on occasional consultant studies. In-house
capabilities for updating the forecast regularly should be developed. This
would allow to react on time, enrieh and improve the methodology through
regular analysis of forecasting errors; it would improve the understanding
of the country's electricity market, of its evolution, and of its
relationship with the country's economic structure and social behaviors.

POWER SECTOR REHABILITATION AND DISTRIBUTION PROJECT
Electlicity Tariffs
Recent evolution of tariffs
1.       Tariffs remained unchanged between 1975 and 1979.  In December
1980, CDE introduced monthly increases of 2% for 16 months as well as a
fuel surcharge. Apart from the tariff restructuring enacted in connection
with the proposed project, the last tariff action dates back to January
1985 - March 1986. Industrial tariffs were then increased by 25% and a
system of surcharges on the total bill depending on the level of monthly
consumption was applied to residential and commercial tariffs. In addition
to this adjustment, tariffs have been increased by 2% per month until March
1986, with a provision that bills would not increase for residential
customers of less than 300 kWh (87% of the customers and 51% of residential
sales). Also, all private commercial customers are now billed under the
tariff (C2) previously applied only to low voltage customers; this led, to
a price which for the largest commercial users (previously billed under
tariff I4 for more than 25 kVA), was not competitive with the use of diesel
self generating units. The only other recent tariff action has been the
limitation of the tariff applied to the 82% smaller commercial consumers
who use less than 700 kWh/month to RDc 20/kWh (which would not cover the
cost of fuel after the repercussion of the exchange rate unification).
Tables 1 and 2 present the evolution of average rates by sector in
current and real terms. The ratio of average industrial vs. residential
rate evolved from 1.1 to 1 in 1978 to almost 2 to 1 in 1987.
2.       Tariffs, as prevailing by the time of the post-appraisal mission
are described in tables 3, 4, and 5.
Economic costs and marginal cost based tariffs
3.       By end 1985, CDE with assistance from Electricite de France
prepared a tariff study based on LRMC principles. The post-appraisal
mission updated the tariff study to take into account the reduction in fuel
prices in constant dollars and the increase in capital costs since January
1985, as well as some other expected efficiency improvements. Given that
reaching the level of economic costs in the residential sector would
require very large increases (this also applies to a lesser degree to small
and medium commercial customers), alternatives for an initial adjustment
were also proposed together with a strategy for gradual adjustment of the
tariff structure and level. One feature of the proposed restructuring
would be the unification of the three tariffs currently applied to low
voltage non residential customers.

ANNEX 2.9

4.       Industrial tariffs would be adjusted in one step to the structure
and level that corresponds to the economic costs. Medium voltage tariffs
for commercial customers would be adjusted in structure so as to include a
maximum demand charge in addition to the energy price; it would remain
initially slightly above the economic cost, and would be gradually reduced
in real terms in the coming two years; only the customers with very high
load factors would benefit from a reduction in the short term. In medium
and in high voltage stand by tariff options would be offered to those
customers of low load factor who use ,'he network as a backup for self
generation. The unified low voltage tariff for nonresidential uses, would
be a simple two block tariff with a first subsidized block of 340
kWh/month; this would eliminate the sharp discontinuities of the present
tariff; it would also include a service charge to cover metering and
billing costs. The residential tariff would gradually evolve towards a
simple structure with three blocks. There would be a first subsidized
block of 50 kWh/month (30% of users consume less), a second block from 50
to 300 kWh/month and a third block for higher consumption. To facilitate
the transition from the previous tariff system there would initially be two
intermediary blocks (50-150 kWh and 300-800 kWh), these temporary blocks
would gradually be eliminated over a period of two years. The initial
increase would combine a moderate increase for smaller consumers which
would maintain the tariff level in relaticn to the minimum wage taking into
account the increase of the latter on April 1, 1988. For large
consumptions and in particular for 300 kWh/month, a level surpassed by only
5% of Dominican households, subtidies would rapidly be reduced with the aim
that, for that consumption level, the price should rapidly cover at least
the cost of fuel. It is also expected that a rapid re-adjustment of the
tariff for large consumptions will generate significant energy savings and,
thus, contribute to the improvement of the quality of service.
5.       Preliminary evaluations seem to indicate that the average revenue
from marginal cost based tariffs (with the medium term reference tariffs
for low voltage residential and commercial customers) would be reasonably
close to what is required from a financial point of view. Several
documents available in project files (Annex 4.0) provide further details on
the proposed restructuring.

Financial Analysis
Past Financial Perfornance
1.       CDE's financial performance for the period 1982-1986 has been very
weak. Attachments 1 to 4 present the historical financial statements and
the financial indicators for this period. The table below shows a summary
of key financial perfonmance ratios. The rates of return on average
revalued fixed assets in service were negative for all the years, except
for 0% in 1986. The self-financing ratio was negative in the period
1982-85, ranging from -121 in 1982 to -1621 in 1984. The self-financing
ratio for 1986 was 6S. The debt service coverage ratio was lower than one,
except for 1986. Thus, CDE has relied on excessive and increasing
Government contributions to close its financial gap. CDE also entered into
a rescheduling agreement with the Paris Club and commercial banks in 1986.
This agreement,l which reduced the debt service, the tariff measures
applied between 2/1985 and 311986, as well as the use of cheaper fuel by
the more efficient Itabo I coal plant commissioned in September 1985, and a
reduced level of investments are the main reasons for the improvements in
the financial ratios for 1986. CDE's weak operational and financial
performance, caused by the institutional problems indicated in para. 2.15
of the text, is characterized principally by: (a) inadequate tariff
structure and level; (b) high electricity losses due to technical and non-
technical factors; (c) inadequate staffing, salary levels, and over-
staffing; (d) inefficient plant maintenance, leading to excessive fuel
costs; and (e) large amount of accounts receivable. The following table
summarizes CDE's financial performance during 1982-86:
1/ Accrued principal and interest owed to the Paris Club were rescheduled
during 1986: a) the balance, or US$44.6 million owed as of December 31,
1984, was payable as follows: 13.52 in 1986, 11.52 in 1987 and 75% in
four equal payments beginning in 1988; b) capital and interest accrued
from January 1, 1985 to April 1, 1986, or US$36.3, were payable as
follows: 2.5% in each year of the period 1986-1989, 90% in 10 semi-
annual payments beginning in 1991. CDE also rescheduled US$23.5
million of its commercial debt payable as follows: 2% in 1988, 6% in
1989 and 92% in nine annual payments beginning in 1990.

The above results underline the weak financial condition of CDE. Net
internal cash generation, after the Government subsidy for operation,
is negative. The other sources of financing, which amounted to US$379
million, consisted of borrowings, Government equity contributions, and
other sources. The latter includes basically consumer deposits. If



- 71 -                       ANNEX 2.10
Page 4 of 12
the subsidy for operation is taken into account, the total Government
participation in CDE's construction program increases to 37X. The
negative variation in working capital, which was also used to close
CDE's financial gaps, responds to excessive increases in short-term
loans from the Government-owned 'Banco de Reserva de la Repablica
Dominicana (BRRD)" and from the Central Bank (para. 6(d)) and in
accounts payable to local suppliers and contractors currently at a
high level, equivalent to over 300 days overdue.
CDE's Financial Position
3.       CDE's financial position as of December 31, 1986 was weaker
than indicated by the accounting ratios. The debt/equity ratio was
acceptable at 49/51 (because of Government subsidies to cover CDE's
debt service and part of its operating expenses). However, the
average term of the debt was too short at 5.1 years, and the current
ratio, excluding the current portion of long-term debt, was low at
0.7. The excessive amount of accounts receivable, equivalent to about
157 days of sales (US$79 million), contain about US$23 million of
Government overdue accounts which, on a net basis, are amply
compensated by all the subsidies received from the Government. CDE's
Balance Sheet is summarized below:

Fixed Assets and Rate Base
4.       Until 1984, fixed assets were informally revalued yearly, in
accordance with agreements with the Inter-American Development Bank. Since
1984, they are being revalued officially using the CPI (Base: 100 in 1973)
prepared by the "Banco Central de la Republica Dominicana (BCRD)" for the
local costs and the Handy-Whitman Index for the foreign costs.  At December
31, 1986, net assets were valued at US$812 million. In addition to the
fixed assets in its books, CDE operates hydro plants owned by the



- 72 -                      ANNEX 2.10
Page 5 of 12
Government.2 CDE benefits from the energy produced by these plants, and,
in compensation, it assumes their operating cost and a small part of their
outstanding related debt (about US$10 million at December 31, 1986, out of
an total estimated of US$166 million (paLra. 10)). At December 31, 1986,
the revalued gross value of these plants was US$320 million, and the
balance of their related debt serviced by the Goversunent was about US$110
million (Attachment 10). CDE does not operate under a legal rate base.
The last loan agreement (1980) between the Government and IDB for the Lopez
Angostura hydro power project (owned by the Governament and operated by CDE)
calls for a rate of return relating only to revenues and a revalued cost of
Lopez Angostura itself, under the assumption that the energy and capacity
of this plant would be sold by the Government to CDE under proper
commercial terms. (The accounting and institutional problems of CDE have
prevented compliance with this IDB covenant.)
Accounts Receivable
5.       Accounts receivable represented 131 days in 1982, but were reduced
substantially for 1983 and 1984, to 90 and 72 days, respectively. The
decreases of 1983 and 1984 were due to the write-off of about RD$32 million
that Government ministries and agencies owed CDE, against an equivalent
amount of CDE's short-term loans with BRRD. After this measure, accounts
receivable increased again to 99 days in 1985 and 157 days in 1986.   The
build-up of non-Governiment related accounts receivable is attributed to the
perception of the industrial and commercial consumers that the tariff is
high and the service is poor, to insufficient meters and vehicles to cut-
off delinquent payers, and to insufficient trained personnel worJ'ng in the
collection function.
Equity and Liabilities
6.       At December 31, 1986, CDE's equity and liabilities consisted
principally of:        ,                                              4
(a)  Equity:  84% corresponds to the revaluation reserve.  Because
Government subsidies to offset operating costs are registered in
CDE's income statements as Other Income, CDE's Retained Earnings
do not represent fairly the past earnings capacity of CDE;
(b) Lone-Term Debt: The principal long-term foreign credhtogs of CDE
are: "Banco Exterior de Espaina," US$158.3 million; Inter-American
Development Bank, US$7.2 million; Export-Import Bank of the U.S.,
US$50.9 million; Bank of Nova Scotia, US$20.7 million; and
Marubeni Co., US$18 million (Attachment 9);
(c)  Accounts Payable:  The US$51 million were equivalent to over 300
days of operating costs (excluding depreciation and payroll and
the component of fuel costs which are paid within 30 days) plus
the estimated local component (25%) of CDE's construction costs
and 90 days of the foreign component. Because of this excessive
delay in paying its bills, CDE is currently operating on a
prepayment or COD basis; and

Larga, Valdesia, Rinc6n and L6pez Angostura (text, para. 2.31).

(d) Other Current Liabilities: Excluding US$60 million of the current
portion of the long-term debt, the remaining US$98 million contain
DR$211 million (equivalent to US$60.3 million) from the BRRD
(DR$180 million) and from the Central Bank (DR$31 million), used
during 1980-1966 to cover CDE's operating deficits, in addition to
Government subsidies. CDE has never serviced these loans, which
are in CDE's books, accumulating interest. Since this short-term
support was necessf.ry to make up for CDE's insufficient tariff
levels, the Govertment should agree to capitalize these debts, as
of December 31, 19g7. by no later than December 31, 1988
(para. 10).
Investment and Financing Plan
7.       CDE's 1988-1994 investment program (Annex 2.8), including
construction and studies for future projects, interest during construction
(IDC), and requirements for working capital, amounts to US$1,469 million.
The proposed financing plan for CDE's investment program is summarized on
the next page. CDE would finance US$60 million (41 of the total) with its
own funds. The remaining US$1,409 million would be covered by US$1,063
million of loans, US$334 million from Government contributions, and US$12
million from consumer deposits.
8.       The proposed Power I project, excluding IDC, would require US$133
million (9% of the total investment program). The proposed Bank loan for
this project would amount to US$105 million (including US$10 million IDC
and would cover 79Z of the total investment required for the project. The
differerce of US$28 million equivalent, in local currency, would be
provided by CDE's own resources.
9.       The principal financing sources of CDE's investment program, whose
terms are indicated in Attachments 9 and 10, have the following
characteristics:

(a) Existing loans are expected to continue financing CDE's ongoing
investments in generation, plant rehabilitation, transmission, and

distribution. The amount pending at December 1987 totalled US$13;
million;
(b) IDB's loan for an estimated US$85 million, including IDC, is
planned to be appraised around 9/1988. This loan will complement
the rehabilitation and expansion of CDE's distribution networks in
10 cities outside Santo Domingo;
(c) International Development Institutions: The foreign component
cost of CDE's generation expansion plants begun before 1992 are
expected to be financed principally by these institutions, at
terms similar to the ones assumed for the proposed Bank loan. The
foreign component cost of these plants add up to US$519 million.
It is expected t.iat a significant part of this amount would be
cofinanced through a combination of export/suppliers credits and
commercial banks;
(d) Suppliers andlor Export Credits: Because CDE's finances are
expected to reach a satisfactory level by 1992, the foreign
component cost of those CDE thermal generation plants whose
construction begins in 1992 and thereafter are assumed to be
financed largely by suppliers and/or export credits. Until 1994,
this type of financing would total US$217 million; and
(e)  The Bank loan: is assumed at an interest rate of 8% per annum, a
-ommitment charge of .75%, and a repayment period of 17 years,
including 4 years of grace.
Government Contributions
10.      Historically, the Government has made equity contributions to
finance part of CDE's system expansion. The source of a part of these
Government contributions has been foreign export credits contracted and
serviced by the Government. The Government also services the debt of
Government-owned generation plants operated by CDE. At December 31, 1986,
the Government debt to export entities and international institutions had
an estimated balance of around US$166 million (Attachment 10 shows an
outstanding balance of US$127 million, which excludes an estimated US$39
million of loans not registered in CDE'S records). CDE's 1988-1994
financing plan is based on the following Government contributions:
(i)   From the following already contracted bilateral financing
sources: KFW, French export credits, r.1 from "Fondo de
Inversiones de Venezuela (FIV)" under the San Jose agreement.3
3/ This agreement was signed on August 3, 1980 in San Jose, Costa Rica
between Venezuela and Mexico and the Central American and Caribbean
countries, including the Dominican Republic. Under it, out of the
28,000 bpd of crude oil imported by the Dominican Republic, 14,000 bpd
would be sold by Venezuela and 14,000 bpd by Mexico under the following
terms: 30% of the yearly billings would take the form of a 5-year 4%
per year credit, repayable at the end of year 5. However, if the
amount of the credit were to be used in projects of great economic
impact or preferably in energy development related projects, then,
prior to approval, the terms of said credits would change to 20 years,
2% per year interest, and a 5-year grace period. The parties have been

Disbursements pending from these sources at December 1987
totalled US$101 million;
(ii) From the Treasury, in amounts needed to close CDE's annual
financing gaps, which are expected to total US$173 million. Of
this amount, about US$15 million would be provided during 1988
by direct Government contributions. The remaining US$158
million would be reduced from CDE's deficit by a direct
assumption of CDE's debt service by the Government for an
equivalent amount (US$60 million in both 1988 and 1989 and US$38
million in 1990). The Government intends to offset its support
to CDE largely from the proceeds of an export tax on sugar and
minerals earmarked for CDE and decreed in November 1987 and
estimated to generate about US$45 million in 1988 and 1989.
Also, the Government's liability could be further reduced to the
extent that the G,overnment is successful in rescheduling the
national debv to cozzercial banks and Paris Club creditors.
CDE's portion of th's debt would amount to US$102 million of
principal repayment and US$61.8 million of interest due to Paris
Club and commercial bank creditors during 1988-1990; and
(iii) From capitalization of the US$60 million equivalent short-term
debt owed to BRRD and to BCRD (par- 6(d) above).
11.      CDE maintains reserve accounts for its pension and severance
liabilities, and pays directly from these accounts to employees who leave
the company. CDE contributes with 4Z and the employees with 3Z of the
monthly payroll. A 1986 actuarial study found that CDE's pension reserve
would be underfunded by some US$15 million if all trade union pacts
regarding this fund are taken into account. CDE is currently revising the
trade union pacts, and it is not clear what the final yearly contribution
would be. Until this issue is resolved, CDE's contribution, equivalent to
about US$0.6 million per year, would continue. The projection assumes that
tIhe same US$0.6 million per year are paid out of the fund. The other
liability reserve--an important source of cash generation--is CDE's
¢onsumet Deposits fund, which is expected to provide US$12 million during
1988-94.
12.      Historic and forecast financial statements and forecast
operational performance and financial indicators for 1988-94 are presented
in Attachments 4 through 8.  Attachments 9 end 10 list all CDE and
'Government debt related to CDE's operations.  Disbursement and debt setvice
lschedules of existing and future loans are kept in the project file
(Annex 4).
Financini and Monitorint Policy
13.      The main policy objective of CDE's new management is to
rehabilitate the technical and financial operations of CDE to a level whirh
Continued from previous page
renewing this agreement yearly. The agreement was ratified on July 18,
1983 at a Presidents' meeting in Cancun, Mexico. However, due to the
present liquidity constraints of both Mexico and Venezuela, the
projections assume that no new financing from this agreement will be
available, except for commitments already mad*.

would enable it to provide an efficient and reliable service to its
customers, without subsidies or financial support from the Government, by
1991.  The Bank agrees with this target date.  Because of the yet uncertain
valuA of CDE's existing fixed assets in operation and the yet uncertain
date when Government-owned multipurpose generation plants (operated by CDE)
would be transferred to CDE's ownership (parsa. 2.3), both the working and
self-financing ratios would be best suited to monitor the adequacy of CDE's
revenues and rehabilitation progress.  The annual targets listed in
para. 14 below were agreed during negotiations.  Normally one revenue
indicator would be required. However, in this case, the self-financing
ratio is needed as a further assurance on CDE's contribution to investment
targets, in case the Government decides to transfer to CDE the full debt
currently serviced by the Government (para. 2.31 of the main text).
Financial Rehabilitation Comituents
14.      Taking into account the effects of expected local and external
inflation, the improvement in projected revenues and operating income are
based principally on the attainment of the following targets, which were
agreed by the Government and CDE during negotiations:
(a) A combined tariff restructuration and rate increase program
(para. 2.44 of nain text), which should produce the following
average date increases in real terms:
Estimated     Proposed Annual Averages
Dec 1987        1988    1989    1990
Average Rate USC/kwh*       4.54         5.70    6.75    6.75
* In constant December 1987 US Dollars.
(b) A program to reduce energy losses (see text, para. Z.36) according <,
to the following yearly targets:
Actual             As Z of Net Generation
1987     1988  1989  1990  1991  1992  1993  1994
32       30    27    24    22    20    19    18
in conjunction with a program to rehabilitate CDE's thermal plants
(see text, para. 2.32) and increase the use of hydro- and coal-
based generation, over that based on fuel oil and gas oil, to
reduce CDE's unit costs of purchased energy and fuel by some 402
by 1991;
(c) The Government and CDE agreed on the financial targets for CDE
indicated in Attachment 8 with particular emphasis on the working
and self-financing ratios (paras. 2.43 and 2.44 of main text).
(d) CDE should obtain financing for and initiate the Revenue
Improvement Program (see text, para. 2.36). This small program
(US$4 million) is being financed in part by USAID (US$3 million).
Because this program is an essential complement to the overall
rehabilitation of CDE, its implementation is an important part of
the Action Plan (item 7.1 of Annex 2.3).

(ii) In addition to the above direct support, the Government
further subsidizes the power sector by servicing both the debt of
Government-owned-CDE-operated plants and some of the debt related
to CDE owned plants by an aggregated amount which would total
about US$25 million p.a. until after 1995.
(f) Accounts receivable: The Government and CDE have agreed to the
following targets (expressed in equivalent days of sales):
Dec
1986
Real     1988      1989      1990
Residential                      133      100        75       60

Government and Parastatals       220      150       100       60
As a complement, the Government has agreed to pay its current
consumption within 60 days of billing and its past arrears to CDE
in 24 monthly installments, both commitments beginning no later
than June 30, 1988. Also it agreed to continue to pay its past
arrears at the rate of the equivalent of US$2 million per month.
This repayment effort was begun in September 1987 (item 6.6 of
Annex 2.3).
(g)  CDE has agreed to pay all CDE's accounts payable to local
suppliers and contractors from the current over-300-days billing
date to within 90 days by December 31, 1989, and to within 60 days
by December 31, 1990 (item 6.7 of Annex 2.3); and
(h) To stop the increasing number of resignations, before
September 30, 1988 the Government has agreed to allow CDE to
increase the salary of its professional staff to levels compatible
with the local private sector (Annex 2.3, item 2.4).
Other Agreements Reached under he Proposed Loan
15.      In addition to the Bank's standard conditions and the ones already
mentioned, the following were specifically agreed ons



- 79 -                      ANNEX 2.10
Page 12 of 12
(a)  Monitoring of Critical Indicators.  No later than June 30 and
Decemoer 30 of every year, CDE should issue a report for the
Government and the Bank showing CDE's historic and forecast
12-month performance aith respect to tariff, operating and self-
financing ratios, rate of return and revalued assets, accounts
receivable, accoun5ts ps-yable, heat rates of thermal plants, and
distribution losses, including proposals for any adjustments
required to achieve covenanted results;
(b) CDE will revise, update, and deliver to the Bank its 8-year
investment program and financial projections report by September
30, 1987 and thereafter by June 30 of every year. The projections
would indicate the timing of any measures that would be taken to
comply with the financial covenants and targets agreed with the
Bank;
(e)  Capital Expenditur  Limitation.  Unless the Bank shall otherwise
agree, CDE would not undertake capital expenditures during the
project implementation period, other than those of its present
expansion program, which would increase the value of its gross
fixed assets in operation by more than 1.5% in any year;
(d) Debt Service Coverage Test. Unless the Bank shall otherwise
agree, CDE would not contract new loans, unless the value of the
debt service coverage test is equal or greater than 1.5; and
;e) Annual Audited Financial Statements would be presented to the Bank
no later than nine months after the close of CDE's fiscal year
1987, six months after the close of 1988, and four months after
the close of every year thereafter.

generation ratio.) Ratio of net internal cash generation (difference
between sources from operation and the sum of cash expenses from operation,
debt amortization and interest charged to operation) to the average
construction (average construction costs of the previous, present and
following year). Because of the effect of terminal years, the average
construction cost for 1986 is calculated with the data for this year and
the following year, and the average construction cost for 1994 is
calculated with data for this year and the previous year.
Cu&rent Ratio. Ratio of current assets to current liabilities.
Collection Period (days). Ratio of the balance of accounts receivable less
provision for bad debt at the end of the year to the equivalent of one day
of sales revenues (total sales revenues divided by 365 days).
Debt/Debt + Equity Ratio. Ratio of long-term debt (including current
portion) to the sum of long-term debt and equity.
Debt Service Coverage Ratio. Ratio of gross internal cash generation
(difference between sources and cash expenses from operation plus other net
income excluding government subsidies) to total debt service (excluding
interest during construction financed by loans).
Average Rate In Current Dollars. Ratio of total revenues from sales to
total sales in kWh.

ANNEX 2.10
Attachment 8
Page 3 of 3
Average Rate in Constant Dollars. Ratio of average rate in current dollars
to the escalation factor for external inflation (EFEI). The EFEI base is
December 1987 and the mid-year values for 1988-94 are calcaulated with
evolution in the Unit Value Index of Manufactured Exports (MUV Index) from
selected developed countries (France, Germany, Japan, United Kingdom and
United States) to less developed country markets, expressed in US dollar
that the IBRD reproduce from time to time.
Sales (GWh). Total electricity sales in GWh during the period.
Net Peak Demand (MW). The greatest instant amount of capacity (MW)
delivered any time of the year by CDE's power system, measured in megawatts
(MW), less megawatts consumed for station service.
System Load Factor. Ratio of the average load in kilowatts during the year
to the peak load in kilowatts in the same period.
Fixed and Temporary Personnel, Total personnel employed by CDE at the end
of the year in all departments either on a fixed term or termporary basis.
Customer Efficiency Ratio. Yearly average of the monthly ratio of the
number of customers to the total number of employees at the end of each
month.
Losses. Ratio of kilowatt hours lost to Net Available Energy to the System
(NAES). Kilowatt hours lost is the difference between NAES and kilowatt
hours billed to the customers. NAES is equal to net generation plus
purchases from other sources.
Gross Generation. Gross generation (GWh) is the total electric energy
produced by the generating plants during the year.
Net Generation. Net generation is the gross generation less kilowatt hours
consumed for station use.
Outages. Number of unforeseen interruptions of electricity ieivice due to
failure in generating, transmission and distribution plants.

2)   Electricity sales.  See Annex 2.5 (Table 7).
3)   Average tariff.  See Annex 2.10 (Attachment 8, line 470).
4)   Other operating revenues.  Historically at an average of about 3% of
total sales revenues.
5)   Generation expenses
Fixed operating costs for existing plants were based on accounting
figures for 1987 and projected in accordance with external price
escalation factors (see 17 below).
Fixed operating costs for future plants were based cn a study prepared
by a Bank consultant and projected in accordance with external price
escalation factors (see 17 below).
6)   Energy purchase costs
In accordance with the current CDE/Falconbridge ccntract, the cost is
US$43.51/MWh.
7)   Transmission and distribution expenses
Estimated at 1% per year of the investment costs for transmission and
2.5% per year of the investment costs for distribution.
8)   Fuel expenses
Thermal generation was estimated by simulation of the operations of
the system with a mathematical model prepared by a Bank consultant.
Specific consumption of plants are CDE's figures, including
improvement of heat rates by rehabilitation. The following unit costs
of fuel were used:

1988      1989
fuel oil         US$/barrel           15.00      18.00
gas oil          US$/barrel           20.00      24.00
coal             US$/ton              45.97      43.14
Prices for 1988 are based on expectations prevailing in the Dominican
Republic in February 1988. From 1989 onward, prices are based on the
expected level of international prices. Thereafter, prices are assumed to
increase according to the external inflation. The price of coal in 1988
includes the effect of CDE having operated the coal plant (ITABO 1) with
fuel oil during January and February 1988.
9)   Depreciation.  3.3Z of the average gross fixed revalued assets in service.
10) Billing and collection expenses. 1.92 of totai annual sales revenues
plus US$15 per consumer escalated by international inflation.
11) Bad debt. 1Z of billings.

4.       Methodology
4.1.    Part 1 and Phase 1 of Part 2 should be started simultaneously.
4.2.     Phase 1 of Part 2
This stage would consist of the following components:
- Diagnostic review;
- Presentation and discussion of preliminary findings;
- Development of work plan for Phase 2.
4.3.     Phase 2 of Part 2
This would be the main body of the project but its planning is
dependent on the findings of Phase 1. It would consist of the following
main subphases:
- Development of recommendations;
- Review and approval of recommendations;
- Implementation and training;
- Follow-up.
5. General Description of Work
Each component or subphase is described in the following paragraphs.
5.1.     Part 1.: The updating of CDE's accounting ledgers would be led and
supervised by a consulting firm satisfactory to the Bank and should be
carried out principally by suitably qualified CDE staff (existing or newly
appointed). The updating process should be implemented jointly with the
establishment of quality and control standards, disciplinary procedures and
a clear definition of responsibilities within each directorate of CDE.
5.2.     Phase 1 of Part 2
(a) Diagnostic Review
The review should be carried out by the consulting firm and would
consist of interviews with key management officials at headquarters
followed by a visit to the principal provincial offices. During these
interviews and visits, all areas and elements listed in the section "Scope"
of this proposal, such as records, systems, procedures and other
documentation, should be examined and discussed to the extent necessary to
determine what areas require to be improved to respond to the needs of
management and to provide a more efficient and controlled administration.
This effort would provide the opportunity to accumulate and document a
substantial part of the base data needed later on for the development of
recommendations. Another important goal of the diagnostic review will be
to determine to what extent and at what pace the present staff in the
provincial offices and headquarters can absorb changes and what level of
sophistication of systems and procedures is required and practical.



- 100 -
ANNEX 2.11
Page 5 of 6
(b) Preliminary Findings
At the conclusion of the diagnostic review, a short report with
observations and findings should be prepared. This report should be
discussed with the management of CDE, with representatives of the Bank, to
determine what elements of the accounting and internal auditing
organization and administration should be analyzed as part of the project
to produce specific recommendations for their improvement. This will
provide the terms of reference for the remainder of the study.
(c) Work Plan
Once an agreement is reached on the nature and extent of the
remainder of the study, a detailed work plan should be drawn up with
specific schedules. It should also indicate who is responsible for each
task and the role expected of both the consulting firm and CDE. Deadlines
will be established in accordance with priorities in addition to work
requirements. At this stage, a cost and timing proposal for rhase 2 of
Part 2 should be provided.
5.3. Phase 2 of Part 2
(a) Development of Recommendations
Tnis phase of the project will be the most extensive. It will
deal with all areas and elements listed under the section "Scope" which
have been selected for further analysis following the preliminary findings.
It will also require further visits to all departments at headquarters and
to provincial offices to gather additional data. All of the
recommendations and new procedures and documents should be designed at
CDE's headquarters with the involvement of management officials. All areas
involving decentralization or procedures affecting provincial offices
should be discussed with directors and personnel of these offices. A
tentative implementation plan of action will be prepared describing: (i)
the work and all the recommendations; (ii) all new procedures, forms or
other documents for implementation; and (iii) a timetable for
implementation of the recommendations together with a list of priority
areas to be improved or corrected. This section may also offer various
alternative solutions where indicated or where a system requires drastic
changes.
(b) Review and Approval of Recommendation
Recommendations would be submitted for discussion and approval by
CDE and the Bank before proceeding with the implementation stage.
(c) Implementation and Training
After recommendations have been approved as acceptable to all
parties the implementation plan would be final. The plan will indicate
deadlines and responsibilities for implementing each component or task.
Again, this plan will be discussed with CDE and the Bank to determine
priorities and realistic deadlines. While extensive assistance from the
consulting firm is expected for implementing some of the recommendations,

ANNEX 2.11
Page 6 of 6
CDE's staff should be involved to the extent possible fr all activ'ties.
To ensure successful results, an appropriate training program under the
consultant's supervision should be developed during the implementation
phase. This program will involve hands-on experience for every office or
department involved with a particular system or procedure.
(d) Follow-up
The implementation plan will provide for periodic follow-up for up
to about 12 months, after the initial training program and after all new
systems have been installed or modified.  This will ensure that the new
systems and procedures are well understood and functioning properly. It
will also provide an opportunity to test the practical application of the
new systems and, if called for, make any desirable modification to them.

POWER SECTOR REHABILITATION AND DISTRIBUTION PROJECT
Terms of Reference for CDE's Revenue Improvement Program
Objectyve
1.       The objective of the project is to improve CDE's collections by reducing
irregular and illegal connections through the implementation of an inspection, control,
and vigilance program of non-technical losses as well as through a training and public
relations program.
Scope of Work
2.       Implementation of the Revenue Improvement Program (RIP) would be carried out as
follows:
(a) Identification of Losses: Irregular and illegal connections would be identified
geographically by areas, giving priority to those where percentage of losses are
higher.
(b) Reduction of Losses: After the major areas of losses are being identified,
efforts would be concentrated to:
(i)      install meters to all users that were directly connected to the
secondary distribution lines;
(ii)     replacemeno of old and damaged meters; and
(iii)    replacement of service drops and other irregular connections at the
meters.
These activities would be carefully monitored through a computerized program to
measure the improvements by areas.
(c) Inspection and Vigilance: With the assistance of the computerized program the
distribution unit in coordination with the commercial directorate will keep a
strict vigilance of the levels of reduction of losses. At the same time the
commercial regional offices would be assisted to improve their collecting
procedures. A review of the existing administrative procedures would be carried
out and improvements would be implemented. Each commercial regional office would
have a computer terminal for billing purposes and a consumer affairs department
would be created.
(d) Public Relations: A public relations program would be Implemented to improve
CDE's image and credibility.

be handled, and operational restrictions imposed by the power plants;
(b) Review and evaluate all work completed by PRC - Harris regarding site
investigations, drillings, laboratory tests, geophysics studies, and others, and
complete all additional work required for study;
(c) Review all conceptual designs for different reasonable altrnatives for the new
offshore coal terminal, and complete the technical and economic justification.
Evaluation of alternatives should take into account the present value of all
capital investments, transportation cost, operational and maintenance costs,
environmental impact and safety considerations;
(d) Preparation of preliminary designs and cost estimates of the selected
alternatives, including construction, operation and maintenance cost;
