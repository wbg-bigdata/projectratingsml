MEMORANDUM AND RECOMHENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT
OF THE INTERNATTONAL BANK FOR RECONSTRUCTION
AND DEVELOPMENT TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS ON
A PROPOSED LOAN TO THE CORPORACION DOMINICANi
DE ELECTRICIDAD WITH THE GUARANTEE OF
THE DOMINICAN REPUBLIC FOR A
POWER SECTOR REHABILITATION AND DISTRIBUTION PROJECT
1.       The following memorandum and recommendation on a proposed Loan to
the Corporacion Dominicana de Electridad (CDE) with the guarantee of
Dominican Republic for US$105.0 million equivalent is submitted for approval.
The loan would have a term of 17 years, including 5 years of grace, at the
Bank's standard variable interest rate and would help finance a power sector
rehabilitation and distribution project.
2.       Background. Electricity service in the Dominican Republic has been
plagued for many years by severe deficiencies, which have limited development
possibilities of industry and mining and reduced access to electricity supply
to residential users. The following have contributed to this situation: (a)
lack of clear policies regardir.g power sector development and financing, (b)
an inadequate institutional framework, and (c) a disorganized and inefficient
institution. The national power utility and the borrower of the proposed
loan, the Corporacion Dominicana de Electricidad (CDE), currently faces the
most severe crisis in its history, characterized by: (a) poor organization
and management, (D) no cost effective system for expansion planning, (c)
deficient metering, 1'illing, collection and accounting procedures, (d)
inefficient energy production and distribution, (e) a weak financial
situation caused principally by inadequate tariff structure and level, and
(f) both overstaffing and lack of capable and experienced staff. Quality of
service around the country, specially in the Santo Domingo area, has become
extremely poor. Feeders and substations are overloaded, voltage drops and
system disturbances largely exceed internationally accepted standards, and
power shortages are frequent. Distribution networks are very deteriorated
because of inadequate maintenance and insufficient investments in system
expansion. Since 1974, CDE has been financially illiquid as its prices have
been below production costs, as a result of operating inefficiencies and
under-pricing. Under these circumstances, the Government has been forced to
provide sizeable resources as subsidies to the sector, which in turn
increases the public sector deficit.
3.       In summary, given the Government's serious financial constraints,
and the importance of an adequate and reliable supply of electricity to the
development of the economy, CDE's critical situation is one of the main
issues facing the Government in its overall management of the public sector.
The Government recently decided to take actions to mitigate CDE's problems
through a series of measures which included: (a) the enacting of a decree
which declared CDE in status of emergency and dismissed the Board of
Directors, (b) the nomination of new Board of Directors and new General
Administrator and key managers, (c) the start-up of a program to improve
collections and reduce arrears, (d) the implementation of programs for the
rehabilitation of thermal generating plants, and (e) the implementation of
the first step of a tariff restructuring program designed to reflect better



the costs of service, resulting in a 15Z increase in the average rate over
the end-1987 level. While these actions will eventually improve CDE's
operations, other issues need to be resolved if CDE is to get on the rilht
trak. These are: (a) the chronically weak financial situation, (b) the low
level of rates, and (c) the scarcity of financial resources for investments.
4.       Rationale for Bank involvement. One of the principal elements of the
Bank's strategy in the Dominican Republic is to support increased public
sector efficiency through institutional rehabilitation (management, finances
and operations) of parastatal enterprises. The most important institution in
this regard is CDE. Through participation in the preparation of this
proposed first Bank operation in the power sector, the Bank has been
instrumental in focussing Government attention on the need for a
comprehensive and rigorous approach to dealing with CDE's long-standing,
acute problems. Continuation of this involvement both financially and
through advice is important to the successful implementation of this
approach.
5.       Project objectives. The project would sz.vport initiation of a medium
term program of reforms for CDE to improve its capabilities and efficiency
through: (a) rationalization of CDE's tariff structure and levels and
improvement of CDE's self financing ratio to at least 142 by 1991: (b)
strengthening system planning capability and developing least-cost power
expansion plans that conform to the development objectives of the country;
(c) improvement of CDE's operations through reduction of distribution losses
and improvement of thermal plant efficiency, (d) improvement of CDE's
organizational structure and its managerial and technical capability; (e)
improvement of essential system infrastructure by rehabilitating and
expanding CDE's distribution and transmission networks; and (f) strengthening
the sector norms and procedures on environmental matters, particularly those
related to the operation of coal-fired thermal plants.
6.       Project description. The proposed project would include the
following components: (a) rehabilitation and expansion of distribution
networks in the Santo Domingo area (26? of project cost), (b) construction of
transmission lines and substations in Santo Domirgo (192), (c) rehabilitation
of thermal gererating plants (29%), (d) a training program and technical
assistance in the financial, planning, technical and administrative areas
(4?): ke) consulting services for project management, for monitoring of coal
contamination, and for the design of an ash disposal system for coal-fired
thermal plants (8?); and (f) physical and price contingencies (142). The
project is expected to be carried out by CDE in seven years and would provide
funds for equipment, spare parts, training, technical and management
assistance. The project total cost is estimated at US$120.4 million, of
which the foreign component is US $96.1 million (802) and its total financing
requirements amount to US$133.2 million. A breakdown of costs and the
financing plan are shown in Schedule A. Amounts and methods of procurement
and of disbursements, and the disbursement schedule are shown in Schedule B.
A timetable of key project processing events End the status of Bank
operations in the Dominican Republic are given in Schedules C and D,
respectively. A map showing the area of influence of the project is attached.

7.       Agreed Actions.  The Government ard CDE have agreed on the following
actions: (a) As Conditions of Loan Effectiveness CDE would have: (i)
established the Project Executing Unit (PEU), (ii) appointed a Planning
Director, a Financial and Management Advisor and the Project Coordinator of
the PEU, and (iii) employed consultants for the detailed engineering work,
and management of the technical aspects of the project; (b) Action Plan: CDE
has agreed to effect prompt institutional, management and financial
improvements through the implementation, with the help of consultants where
necessary, of a comprehensive Action Plan which includes: (i) adoption of
improved financial and accounting systems by June 30, 1989; (ii) elimination
of Government subsidies by 1991 with specific annual intermediate targets;
(iii) improvements in productivity in all areas, notably reduction of system
losses from 32Z in 1987 to 18Z in 1994 with annual intermediate targets; (iv)
revenues increases and cost reductions to lower CDE's working ratio from IC)Z
in 1987 to 701 by 1991 with annual intermediate targets; (v) taking such
tariff action as is necessary to meet these ratios and continue the
restructuring of tariffs, particularly for residential use, such that each
category of custumer pays according to the economic cost of service; (vi) the
Government would pay its current power consumption within 60 days from
billing date bieginning no later than June 30, 1988, and would continue to pay
its arrears at the rate of at least DR$ 10 million (about USS 2.0 million
equivalent) per month, (vii) bring CDE's insurance coverage to adequate
levels by March 30, 1989: (c) Contract Plan:  adoption by September *0, 1988
of an agreement. (Contract Plan), satisfactory to the Bank, between the
GovernmPnt and CDE committing the Government to maintaining a policy of
providing corporate independence and stability to CDE; allowing CDE to set
the stru(tjre and level of its tariffs in accordance with the econom:c costs
of Plectricity service: and supporting CDE in carrying out the Action Plan;
and (d) Other: (i) the Government and CDE would not undertake during the
project implementation period investments in assets to be operated by CDE,
other than those included in CDE's expansion program agreed with the Bank,
which would increase the value of CDE's gross fixed assets in operation by
more than 1.5Z in any year; and (ii) review performance of Action Plan,
investment programs and financial projections by September 30, 1988 and by
June 30 of every year thereafter with the right to suspend further
commitments or disbursements if performance is unsatisfactory and appropriate
remedial action satisfactory to the Bank is not adopted.
8.       Benefits. Economic benefits under the proposed project are expected
from: (a) increase of sales through the rehabilitation and expansion of the
transmission and distribution networks, (b) reduction of operating expenses
from the rehabilitation of thermal plants, and (c) savings in fuel
consumption and postponement of investments in generation due to the
reduction of losses. Thotugh difficult to quantify, it is estimated that,
additionally, substantial benefits to the economy would be obtained because
of the improved quality of the service. The economic rate of return of the
project is estimated at 9%, with revenues used as a proxy for benefits.
9.       Risks. Possible project risks include ineffective management of the
projE( t , lower than expected tariff actions and slow progress in the overall
rehabilitation of CDE. To minimize these risks the project provides for: (a)
the carrying out of a comprehensive Action Plan of institutional



- 4 -
strengthening which include clearly defined performance Lndicators for follow
up of agreed actions; (b) the carrying out of a Contract Plan between the
Government and CDE to support the implementation of CDI'e Action Plan and to
improve CDE's corporate independence; (c) the appointment of consultants to
assist CDE in project implementation and the rehabilitation program: and (d)
annual reviews of performance with the Bank. Even only partial success in
meeting the ambitious objectives of the Project would contribute
significantly to the development of a more efficient sector. Since the
project is viewed as a first in a series of operations designed to promote
sector efficiency, its implementation would be carefully monitored and the
Government and the Bank would need to be ready to make adjustrents to the
Action Plan, if necessary.
10.      Recommendation.  I am satisfied that the proposed loan would comply
with the Articles of Agreement of the Bank and recommend that the Executive
Directors approve the proposed loan.
