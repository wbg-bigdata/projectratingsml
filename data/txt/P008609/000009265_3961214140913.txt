Preface
This is the Implementation Completion Report (ICR) for the Debt and Debt Service Reduction (DDSR)
operation in Poland for which Loan 3804-POL in the amount of US$170 million equivalent was
approved on October 25, 1994, and made effective on November 15, 1994. The DDSR operation also
included the release of set-asides from ongoing adjustment lending operations, for a total of US$230
million equivalent, and a limited waiver of negative pledge clauses in loan and guarantee agreements
between Poland and the World Bank in the amount of US$623.4 million.
The Debt and Debt Service Reduction operation was closed on June 30, 1995, the original closing date
established by the Loan Agreement. The funds (both additional and set-aside) were fully disbursed by
December 2, 1994. Cofinancing for the project for an amount equivalent to the Bank's total participation
was provided by the IMF.
This ICR was prepared by the Country Operations Division, Country Department II, Europe and Central
Asia Region. No specific comments have been received from the IMF. This report has benefited from
oral comments received from advisors to the Ministry of Finance. An independent written evaluation by
the Ministry of Finance of the Republic of Poland has not yet been received.
Preparation of this ICR was started in March 1996 and is based on the Report and Recommendation of
the President, several reports to the Board related to the Operational Guidelines for DDSR operations,
World Bank documentation on DDSR issues, the Loan Agreement and Implementation Agreement of
this DDSR operation, and other memoranda on file at the Country Operations Division. Detailed
information on the final terms of the operation was provided by Bank Handlowy (Poland). This ICR does
not evaluate the conditionality compliance of the loans from which the set-aside funds were obtained.
This conditionality will be addressed in the ICRs of those operations.

Evaluation Summary
Project Objectives and Rationale for Bank Support
The Debt and Debt Service Reduction Loan (3804-POL) of US$170 million equivalent was
approved on October 25, 1994. The operation also included the release of set-aside funds for US$230
million equivalent, provided for under ongoing adjustment lending operations, and a limited waiver of
the negative pledge clauses in loan and guarantee agreements between the Republic of Poland and the
World Bank.
The objective of this operation was to support the Debt and Debt Service Reduction (DDSR)
agreement reached between Poland and its commercial creditors. The Country Assistance Strategy
included support to this agreement because the debt and debt service reduction achieved would enhance
the country's growth prospects and strengthen the transformation process of the Polish economy.
Moreover, this voluntary market-based resolution was expected to restore the country's creditworthiness
and the agreement was consistent with Poland's long-term fiscal and extemal position.
Implementation Experience and Results
The final agreement between Poland and its commercial creditors was signed two days after the
approval of the DDSR operation by the Board of the World Bank. The loan and set-aside funds of this
operation were disbursed on the following month. To summarize the overall commercial debt and debt
service reduction achieved it has become customary to calculate the "debt reduction equivalent" (DRE).
This indicator includes not only the face value reduction accomplished through buy-back and discount
components, but also adjusts for the present value of interest service reduction, the existence of
enhancements (e.g., collateral for principal), and the provision of new money. Also, to evaluate the
financial implications of DDSR operations, the implicit price at which the old debt was exchanged for
the new portfolio is calculated. This price is referred as the "break-even price" (BEP) and is used to



iii
estimate the country's savings relative to a direct repurchase of debt at the post-deal price (PDP). The
latter represents the market's perception of Polish risk after the completion of the DDSR operation.
The DDSR operation in Poland resulted in a DRE of US$8.63 billion. Since total eligible debt
was US$14.43 billion, approximately a 60 percent reduction was accomplished. Also, the total savings
relative to a hypothetical market operation (i.e., repurchase of debt at the post-deal price) were about 39
percent since the BEP was of 52 cents per dollar and the PDP was close to 86 cents per dollar. In
summary, the agreement stabilized the future debt service obligations of the country at low and
predictable levels while accomplishing a higher DDSR (both as a percentage of eligible debt as well as in
financial terms) than that of most other countries that have implemented these operations.
The agreement has also revitalized the country's access to international capital markets,
contributing to restore investor confidence in the Polish economy as evidenced by foreign direct
investment in 1995 of approximately US$2.5 billion. Also, since its implementation, Poland has
successfully issued a 5-year Eurobond for US$250 million with a yield of 185 basis points above the US
Treasury Bond. This new bond issue compares extremely favorably against those of other middle-income
countries that have also implemented DDSR operations.
Overall, the outcome of the operation has been highly satisfactory and the performance of both
the Borrower and the Bank has been outstanding. The operation benefited significantly from the strong
support provided by the World Bank, including two technical assistance projects financed by the
Japanese Trust Fund that enabled the country to prepare and implement this DDSR operation, as well as
from assistance provided by bilateral donors.
Sustainabilitv
The success of the DDSR operation was in large measure due to and a determinant of the overall
achievements of the stabilization and structural reform program pursued since late 1989. This program
has been successful in transforming a centrally planned economy into one in which many key activities
are guided by the market mechanism. As a result, the country has started to show the benefits of the
improved investment climate. For example, Poland's real GDP has been growing at an average of over 5
percent in the last three years and is expected to surpass this year its pre-transition high, in effect
becoming the first transition economy to achieve such recovery. Furthermore, while resuming debt
service obligations constitutes a new challenge for the economy, it is now set at low and predictable
levels consistent with Poland's fiscal and external accounts. In fact, the Debt Service to Exports ratio will
remain at levels only slightly above 10 percent and the debt service obligations of Poland as a percentage
of Total Current Revenues have come down from a high in 1989 of over 17 percent to a more
manageable level below 4 percent.
Moreover, the country has expanded its reliance on trade and the private sector as the engines for
economic growth. In particular, the country has not only increased the volume of trade from slightly
above 30 percent of GDP in 1989 to almost 50 percent in 1995, but has also shifted the direction of trade
from the formerly centrally planned economies to the European Community. As a result, the direction of
trade represents more genuinely the comparative advantages of the country. Also, the private sector has
been growing at double digits, increasing its share in total GDP from 28 percent in 1989 to
approximately 58 percent in 1995.
Within this favorable setting there still remain several challenges for the Polish economy.
Among them, Poland needs to keep its fiscal accounts at levels consistent with available financing. In
particular, the country must implement the pending reform agenda (e.g., privatizations, pension reform,
and public expenditure rationalization) to reduce the risk of facing future unsustainable levels of fiscal
imbalances and to maintain the momentum in the investment climate. Also, while the country is
experiencing important capital inflows due in part to the restored confidence in the economy after the



iv
DDSR operation, it is important for these flows to be closely monitored. In particular, these flows entail
the risk of negatively affecting domestic savings by stimulating private consumption and accelerating the
inflation rate. Thus, the monetary impact of these capital flows needs to be effectively sterilized if the
country is to maintain the high rates of growth and investment required to successfully realize the quest
for economic integration with the European Community. Notwithstanding the challenges that lay ahead,
the continued commitment to the reform process by the previous and current government are an
encouraging sign and suggest that the outcomes of this operation are indeed sustainable.
Lessons
Poland's successful DDSR project confirms lessons that have previously been derived from
similar operations. In particular, the Polish experience suggests that debtor countries.benefit the most
from these operations when they constitute an integral part of the country's ongoing structural reform
program. The rationale for such conclusion is that the country needs to address the structural sources of
the debt crisis to obtain sustainable benefits from debt and debt service reduction.
Also, the government of Poland had a commitment with bilateral creditors to have an economic
program supported by the IMF before the second phase of the Paris Club plan was implemented. This
commitment proved essential in triggering the policy decisions required to successfully complete the
DDSR operation while enhancing the benefits derived from it.
Finally, the key feature of the DDSR operation in Poland is the significant level of debt and debt
service reduction that was obtained. While there are many reasons for this outcome, the inclusion in the
Paris Club agreement of a commitment to provide comparable treatment to official and private creditors
stands out as a key determinant. Hence, one must conclude that while voluntary market-based solutions
to the debt crisis are strictly preferred to mandatory solutions, strong signals from the international
community regarding the expected level of debt and debt service reduction can be beneficial to ensure an
operation that strengthens the country's long-term growth prospects.

B.    Poland's Economy: From Crisis to Reform.
1.    Since the mid-1980's several attempts to reform the Polish economy were undertaken. A key
concern of the government in these many attempts was to solve the product shortages observed by
tackling the distortions that existed in the relative price structure. Unfortunately, because many of the
authorities' reform endeavors were limited in their scope and goals, they failed to address the main
structural challenges faced. Also, as was later the case in most other centrally planned economies, the
lack of financial discipline at the public enterprise level exacerbated an already weak fiscal position by
calling for an increased level of direct and indirect subsidies while deteriorating the financial situation of
the banking sector.
2.    Thus, by the late 1980's Poland was facing a severe macroeconomic crisis that manifested itself
in an increased level of shortages coupled with high rates of inflation. The former was a direct
consequence of what little had been accomplished in the reform of the relative price structure. The latter
resulted from both a deteriorating fiscal situation as well as an increasingly out of control process of
price-wage indexation in the economy. Hence, by 1989 the inflation rate was at an average of over 18
percent a month (equivalent to 640 percent a year) and, in the existing inflationary framework, a
significant drop in real government revenues took place. Moreover, a severe foreign exchange liquidity
crisis emerged partly due to the lack of appropriate economic polices within the country itself and partly
due to the uncertainties resulting from the political events taking hold of Central and Eastern Europe in
general and Poland in particular. As a result, foreign currency reserves fell to less than two months of
imports and the current account deficit reached 2.2 percent of GDP.
3.    In September 1989 a new government assumed the responsibility of handling the economy. The
government strengthened not only the macroeconomic management, but also prepared and began to
implement a challenging and comprehensive Economic Transformation Program (ETP). The program
combined very effectively the requirements of short-term macroeconomic stabilization with the demands
of an ambitious program for structural change. There was considerable support at the international level
for the program put forward by the Polish government. The program was supported by the IMF and the
partial convertibility of the zloty was backed by a Stabilization Fund organized by several industrialized
countries. The Bank supported the ETP through an expanded project lending program, a Structural
Adjustment Loan, and policy advice that subsequently led to the approval by the Board of several
sectoral adjustment operations.
4.    The Bank's support for Poland's economic transformation has had four key objectives which
have been pursued with different degrees of success. First, to modify the distorted relative price structure
of Poland while promoting the development of the appropriate incentives for efficient market functioning
and private sector development. Second, to reform and restructure the financial sector, making it more
responsive to market forces while providing the necessary and modern regulatory framework it requires.
Third, to support a challenging program of public enterprise privatization and restructuring. Finally, to



2
develop a social safety net that targets those sectors of the population most negatively affected by the
adjustment process during the transition from central planning to a market-based society.
C.    Poland's External Debt: From Insolvency to Creditworthiness.
Background.
5.    In the late 1970's Poland joined other middle-income countries in borrowing heavily from
international capital markets. To a large extent this process was influenced by the existing low interest
rates and the ease with which international credit was available. As opposed to other highly-indebted
countries whose external debt went on to finance higher levels of private and public consumption, the
process of indebtedness in Poland was to a significant degree due to the efforts put into modernizing the
economy. To this end, as it is classic in centrally planned economies, the government embarked in a
process of increased levels of investment in heavy machinery and equipment. Unfortunately, as Poland
will later experience, the benefits of high levels of capital accumulation may be impaired when
investment decisions are guided by the incentives put forward by an erroneous and faulty relative price
structure. Furthermore, the lack of accountability and competition in central planning resulted in high
levels of resource wastefulness.
6.     The increased difficulties of Poland to service its debt became evident when in the early 1980's
the capital modernization failed to deliver the hoped-for economic growth payoffs. Therefore, in March
of 1981 Poland announced it was unable to service its debt obligations, almost one year and one half
before a similar announcement by several Latin-American countries. Moreover, the investment decisions
of the late 1970's and early 1980's had little impact on increasing the export potential of the economy.
As a result, some key debt ratios jumped to new records. For example, by 1989 the Debt to GDP ratio
was approximately 54 percent and the Debt to Exports of Goods and Services ratio was above 300
percent. Also, the annual debt service obligations accrued were already beyond one third of the country's
exports and over 70 percent of the country's exports to non-CMEA countries, the main source of hard
currency.
7.     Several attempts were made to normalize Poland's relations with external creditors (both
commercial as well as official). Among them, a multi-year rescheduling agreement was signed in July
1988 which covered almost the entire medium- and long-term obligations with commercial creditors.
This agreement had the objective of providing a comprehensive solution to Poland's external debt
problem, one that was characterized by the repeated failure of previous agreements. Also, during the
1980's the country negotiated rescheduling agreements with its official creditors. Nonetheless, in the
midst of one of its worst economic crisis, Poland ceased to fully service its debt by late 1989. The sole
exception to this de facto default was the continued debt service of trade-related roll-over facilities.
The Case for Debt Relief and External Debt Negotiations.
8.     Although Poland embarked in an ambitious program of reforms, international capital markets
were mostly reluctant to invest in the country. The main reason underlying this reluctance was the still
unresolved debt obligations with external creditors. Moreover, as in most other highly-indebted
countries, the high and volatile external transfers of the past posited a high burden on investment
opportunities by raising the country's investment risk. Also, since most of Poland's external debt was
public or publicly guaranteed, there was a need not only to search for a solution consistent with the
country's external financing program, but also in tune with the status of public finances. Unless a
proposal could be put forward that would reduce the strain on both the fiscal as well as the external
accounts, it was clear that the future macroeconomic stability of the country would be compromised.



3
Furthermore, for such proposal to be successful, it had to be of a medium-term nature. Only an
agreement positing a low and predictable debt service level would forestall the risk of a new external
crisis. In the process, such agreement would enhance the potential investment opportunities in the
country, key for Poland's long-term growth prospects.
9.    The government initiated negotiations with the official creditors of the Paris Club in late 1990.
An agreement was reached by April of 1991 which provided for a 50 percent reduction, on a net present
value basis, of Poland's official external debt. The first phase of this agreement called for a 30 percent
reduction in the period 1991-94. This reduction was to be accomplished through a menu option approach
that included interest and principal reduction components. The second phase, using the same menu
option approach, called for an additional 20 percent reduction in April 1994. Also worth highlighting is
that the agreement included two commitments from the Polish government. First, to seek a reduction in
Poland's debt obligations towards all other creditors (excluding IFIs) on terms comparable to those of the
Paris Club. Second, to comply with the conditionality of the ongoing Extended Fund Facility (EFF). In
fact, implementation of the second phase of the Paris Club agreement was made contingent on Poland's
fulfillment of these two commitments.
10.   The negotiations with commercial creditors represented in the London Club also began in 1990.
Commercial creditors aimed for an agreement consistent with the medium-term fiscal and external
position of Poland and emphasized the need for a prompt resolution of the accumulated past due interest
(PDI) which, by mid-1991, amounted to about US$1.3 billion. The Polish authorities also emphasized
the need for an agreement consistent with the medium-term fiscal and external position of Poland, but
stressed the importance of providing a comparable treatment to official and commercial creditors. In
effect, this required a debt and debt service reduction of close to 50 percent on a net present value basis,
a level of reduction not yet accomplished by highly-indebted middle-income countries. Notwithstanding
the parties interest in solving the impasse, the discussions stalled over the issue of PDI and, to a large
extent, the dialogue broke off until early in 1993.
11.   The period of reduced negotiations between Poland's government and its commercial creditors
was characterized by the former's continued commitment to structural reforms. As a result, Poland
registered in 1992 its first year of positive real GDP growth since the ETP began and the payoffs of the
ambitious reform program started to become evident. Furthermore, the outlook for continued growth was
extremely encouraging. The inflation rate, while still high relative to those observed in industrial
countries, was down to 35 percent a year from its 640 percent level of 1989 and with strong indications
of being in a decreasing trend. Also, after many years with serious imbalances in government finances,
the outlook was for fiscal deficits in 1993 and beyond which were significantly lower to those of
previous years and, above all, consistent with available financing.
12.   Nonetheless, uncertainties remained in the behavior of economic agents in general and the
investment community in particular because of the unsolved status of Poland's external debt with
commercial creditors. Moreover, the date for the implementation of the second phase of the Paris Club
agreement was set for April 1994, but such phase called for a solution to Poland's debt with commercial
creditors. Thus, even though resuming debt service obligations would pose new challenges to Poland's
fiscal position, the need for a prompt solution to Poland's external commercial debt was a pressing
concern that needed to be resolved.
13.   Negotiations resumed in early 1993 after the appointment by the Polish government of a new
debt negotiator and the selection by commercial banks of a new Chairman of the Steering Committee. A
final agreement on the Head of Terms was announced in March 10 of 1994 and provided a
comprehensive framework to deal with Poland's commercial debt. The agreement proposed a menu of



4
options that included both debt and debt service reduction components. Furthermore, it was
comprehensive enough to address not only outstanding long-term debt and revolving trade financing
facilities, but also their related and controversial PDI which by now amounted to almost US$4.5 billion.
The Paris Club reviewed the Head of Terms and found them to be acceptable. In particular, the key
commitment by the Polish government to provide an equal treatment for both commercial as well as
official creditors was found to be complied. In fact, the London Club agreement resulted in a Debt
Reduction Equivalent (DRE) of 60 percent and a reduction on a net present value basis of approximately
49.5 percent. Also, though the EFF had fallen off-track, the government had recently obtained the IMF's
approval for a new set of macroeconomic targets. As a result, the second phase of the Paris Club
agreement --an additional 20 percent reduction-- was allowed to proceed.
14.    Both the Bank and the Fund supported the DDSR operation. In reaching such decision the Bank
found the proposed terms to be consistent with a viable medium-term external financing program for
Poland, while enhancing the country's economic growth prospects and its commitment to the ongoing
reform process. Also, by providing a more predictable and lower level to Poland's debt service, the
agreement was found to be consistent with the country's macroeconomic program. In this regard, the
negative impact on Poland's still unsettled fiscal accounts was expected to be surpassed by the benefits
of enabling the country to have renewed access to international capital markets and the increased
confidence by investors in the economy. Furthermore, as will be discussed, the agreement provided
substantial savings relative to the existing contractual financial conditions of Poland's external debt
obligations.
D.    Characteristics of the London Club Debt Agreement.
Eligible Debt and Menu of Options.
15.    The agreement covered all eligible long-term  debt, revolving trade facilities, and past due
interest. The total eligible debt was estimated in the Report and Recommendation of the President (RRP)
at-approximately US$14.33 billion or 30% of Poland's external debt. Nonetheless, mainly because of
differences in exchange rates, the final eligible debt was slightly higher (approximately US$14.43
billion). Furthermore, as mentioned above, the agreement opened the way for the implementation of the
second phase of the Paris Club agreement. This phase would entail a further reduction of Poland's
external debt by an amount close to US$3.3 billion. As shown in Figure 1, the conjunction of the Paris
Club and London Club agreements had important implications for the size and composition of Poland's
external debt. Also, to a large extent, they provided a solution that was well-balanced in terms of the
sacrifices put forward by the different parties involved.

16.       In accordance with other DDSR  operations and the general guidelines put forward by the Brady
Plan, several options were made available to commercial banks. As summarized in Table 1, the menu of
options varied with the type of debt. The options were broader for all long-term  debt that had been part
of the Debt Restructuring Agreement negotiated in 1988 (DDRA). For this debt, which amounted as of
October of 1994 to approximately US$8.9 billion, commercial banks could opt among discount bonds,
par bonds, buy-back operations, and new money components. The latter served the purpose of
encouraging participation by those banks which, because of their regulatory framework, had high exit
costs. In contrast, the debt originated from revolving short-term trade-related facilities (approximately
US$1.2 billion, to be referred from now onwards as RSTA) and Past Due Interest (about US$4.3 billion)

Implementation.
17.   A DDSR operation for US$170 million was approved by the Board of the World Bank on
October 25, 1994. The operation also included the release of Set-Asides for US$230 million already



6
provided for under adjustment lending operations approved as early as 1991. The Set-Aside funds were
composed of US$30 million from the Financial Institutions Development Loan (FIDL 3341-POL),
US$100 million from the Agriculture Sector Adjustment Loan (ASAL 3600-POL), and US$100 million
from the Enterprise and Financial Sector Adjustment Loan (EFSAL 3359-POL). The total funds provided
by the Bank (i.e., additional and set-asides) were directed to finance a portion of the debt buy-back
component of the operation. Also, a limited waiver was granted of the negative pledge clauses in loan
and guarantee agreements between the Republic of Poland and the World Bank. The waiver permitted
the pledge of collateral for the discount and par bonds issued in replacement of DDRA and RSTA debt.

NOTE: Final Total Eligible Debt amounted to USS14429.7 million, reflecting an almost total participation
of creditors in the DDSR operation.
18.     The Polish government received commitments and the necessary waivers from  commercial
creditors holding almost 100 percent of total eligible debt (see note to Table 2). As mentioned before, the
total eligible debt was US$14.43 billion, approximately US$100 million higher than originally estimated.
Moreover, differences in exchange rates and interest rates implied changes in the distribution among
available options relative to what was originally stated in the RRP of the DDSR operation (see Table 2).
Nonetheless, its characteristics were not significantly altered. In particular, as discussed in the next
section, the operation's implications for debt and debt service reduction remained mostly unchanged.

19.     The DDSR loan became effective in November 15, 1994. The interim  period between approval
and effectiveness was mostly spent complying with the administrative and legal aspects of World Bank
loan disbursements for DDSR operations (e.g., certified copies of appropriate official documents, legal
opinion presented by the country stating that all the Agreements entered into were duly authorized, etc.).
Because of delays in meeting the above requirements, the National Bank of Poland had to advance the



7
funds which were programmed to be provided by the World Bank. This interim arrangement covered the
period between when the DDSR agreement with commercial banks was signed (October 27, 1994) and
the actual disbursement of funds. Both the Additional Funds (the DDSR loan for US$170 million) as
well as the Set-Asides were disbursed between November 22 and December 2 of 1994.
20.    Disregarding for differences in financial conditions among those options available in all three
types of debt (i.e., the differences found in the buy-back price or the interest rates of par bonds in DDRA,
PDI, and RSTA debt), the option most creditors selected was the discount bonds (37 percent of total
eligible debt, see Table 3). Only 11 percent of the DDRA eligible debt was exchanged through the par
bond option. This low showing was mostly due to the upward movement in market interest rates from the
time the term sheet was finalized (March 1994) and the time the actual agreement was effected (October
1994). Nonetheless, the existence of only buy-back and par bond options for both the PDI and the RSTA
debt, together with somewhat better interest rates in these bonds (see Table 1), raised the total
participation of par bonds to approximately 31 percent of total eligible debt. Furthermore, the buy-back
option was chosen by creditors holding approximately 22 percent of eligible debt. Making use of the
operational guidelines as modified in March of 1994, the funds provided by the Bank were used to
finance only the buy-back portion of the operation. However, as shown in Table 3, this operation was to
a large extent well-balanced between debt reduction and debt service reduction.

21.    The US Treasury Bonds used as collateral were deposited at the Federal Reserve Bank of New
York. The funds dedicated to the purchase of eligible debt and associated interest as well as the new
bonds issued were deposited into escrow at the Bank of England for release on the Escrow Release Date
(February 24, 1995). The interim period between October and February was used to complete the debt
reconciliation process. Because of the mentioned differences in exchange rates and interest rates at the
time the operation was closed (October 27, 1994) relative to the initial estimate found in RRP (which
was based on data for September 9, 1994), a modification to the original waiver of the negative pledge
clause was required. More precisely, the initial estimate was that the collateral required and the
corresponding limited waiver of negative pledge clauses in loan and guarantee agreements between
Poland and the World Bank would add up to US$599 million. Hence, at the time of Board approval a
waiver was requested not to exceed US$620 million. Because the final cost of collateral was slightly
higher, the Government of Poland requested that the waiver be extended to permit a pledge for a total of
US$623.8 million. Such request was granted on December 16, 1994. When the reconciliation process

was completed in February of 1995, the total collateral amounted to US$623.4 million, slightly below the
amended waiver amount approved in December.
22.   While the cost of collateral was almost US$25 million higher, the total cost of the operation was
only US$8 million higher than originally estimated (see Table 4). This was mostly due to lower-than-
expected costs for the buy-back component because of slightly lower participation in these operations
(see Table 2). A significant fraction of this debt reduction operation was financed by Poland (62 percent
of total costs). The Bank and the Fund each financed 19 percent of the total costs. This was comparable
to other DDSR operations and did not pose an undue burden on Poland which had a strong net
international reserves position (approximately US$11 billion in September of 1994).
E.    Evaluation of Poland's DDSR Operation.
23.    The RRP indicated that the DDSR operation for Poland was expected to achieve debt and debt
service reduction that was not only comparable to the terms obtained by Poland with its official creditors,
but which also compared extremely favorably with other DDSR operations supported by the Bank. Also,
the completion of the London Club agreement (in conjunction with the implementation of the second
phase of the Paris Club agreement which it triggered) regularized Poland's payments status with external
creditors. Because of the above reasons it was expected that a major source of business uncertainty
would be removed and, consequently, that the country would become attractive for investors (foreign and
domestic).
24.    As discussed below, all of these expectations seem to be confirmed. In particular, as in other
DDSR operations, the indirect benefits seem to have been beyond the most optimistic estimates. As
always, the benefits derived do present risks. On the one hand, the DDSR operation implies a somewhat
greater inflexibility for the resulting debt structure. On the other, these rigidities are compounded if there
are slippages on the economic policy front. Nonetheless, it is encouraging that since the operation took
place the Government of Poland has remained committed to the path of reform initiated in 1989.
Financial Analysis.
25.   This sub-section recalculates the financial aspects of Poland's DDSR operation. To make
consistent comparisons with the results presented in the RRP, the assumptions in that document
regarding future interest rates will be kept unchanged.
DRE Calculations.
26.   In order to evaluate the extent of debt reduction achieved, it has become customary to calculate
the Debt Reduction Equivalent of DDSR operations. This indicator takes into account: (i) the immediate
reduction in the face value of debt that is obtained through buy-back and discount bonds; (ii) the
presence of new money financing which increases the country's future obligations; (iii) the present value
reduction due to interest rates which are lower than those prevailing in the market; and (iv) the
prepayment of collateral issued on some of these new debt instruments. Based on the estimates presented
in the RRP, it was expected that the DRE would add up to US$8.67 billion. This reduction was
equivalent to 60 percent of eligible debt and 18 percent of Poland's total debt.
27.   The calculations, based on the exchange rates and interests rates in effect at the time the
agreement was executed (late October 1994) and on the final distribution among the different DDSR
options, show a total DRE equal to US$8.63 billion and an increase in total eligible debt of almost
US$100 million relative to the estimate found in the RRP (see Table 5). Nonetheless, the ratios relative

to total eligible debt and total debt remained at the broad levels reported in the RRP (Final DRE/Eligible
Debt equal to 60 percent and Final DRE/Total Debt equal to 18 percent). These results place the DDSR
operation for Poland at levels of debt and debt service reduction well beyond those obtained by other
middle-income countries that have also implemented these operations. For example, the DRE as a
percentage of total eligible debt was 26 percent for Venezuela, 39 percent for Argentina, and 43 percent
for Mexico. Also, as a percentage of total debt, the DDSR operation of Poland compares favorably with
the range between 13 and 17 percent of the above mentioned countries. This is the case even when for
Poland its commercial debt was a relatively small fraction of total debt.
Comprehensiveness of DDSR Operation.
28.      To evaluate the financial implications of DDSR  operations, the implicit price at which the old
debt was exchanged for the new portfolio is calculated. This price is referred as the "break-even price"
(BEP) and results from dividing the market value of the new portfolio (i.e., the old debt minus the DRE
obtained plus the net payments to commercial banks) by the face value of eligible debt. The BEP is used
to estimate the country's savings relative to a direct repurchase of debt at the post-deal price (PDP). This
price represents the market's perception of Polish risk after the completion of the DDSR operation and,
in particular, adjusts the market value of new debt for the existence of collateral enhancements.

29.      Since this operation took place at a BEP of 52 cents per dollar of debt and the PDP was of 86
cents per dollar, then the operation resulted in savings relative to a hypothetical market-based debt
reduction operation (i.e., repurchase at post-deal prices) of 39 percent, just slightly below the original
RRP estimate of 39.4 percent (see Table 6). This result reflects not only the deep discounts obtained by



I1
Poland in its commercial debt (reflected in a low BEP), but also the surge of confidence in the Polish
economy following the announcement of the agreement (reflected in a high PDP). Furthermore, at a pre-
deal price of 30 cents per dollar of debt, the operation implied gains to the country of approximately 60
percent of the market's reduced perception of Polish risk. In summary, the DDSR operation of Poland
achieved debt relief at a substantially lower financial cost than a hypothetical market-based debt
reduction operation would have entailed.
Material Benefits.
30.    The material benefits of a DDSR operation relate not only to the savings from the changed path
of debt service obligations (i.e., direct benefits), but also to the behavior of economic agents as result of
the increased confidence in the economy (i.e., indirect benefits). The evaluation of both of these benefits
is, to a certain degree, subjective. For example, when analyzing the direct benefits of a DDSR operation
one must posit a counterfactual against which to compare it. As a result, the conclusions derived will
depend on the assumptions behind the counterfactual being used, particularly those related to the
financial conditions. Similarly, judging the indirect benefits of a DDSR operation in light of the
increased confidence in the economy is incapable of distinguishing among those benefits which originate
froii the ongoing reform process, those which may result from exogenous positive shocks (e.g., renewed
capital flows because of lower interest rates abroad), and those that result from the DDSR operation
itself. Notwithstanding the above, what follows is an attempt to discuss the material benefits of this
DDSR operation. To make comparisons possible with the RRP estimates, this sub-section will build on
the counterfactuals there presented.
Direct Beneftsi.
31.    The RRP posited two alternative scenarios. In Counterfactual I it was assumed that in the
absence of a DDSR operation the country would have continued to service all of its debt at a spread over
the LIBOR rate of 13/16. Also, this counterfactual assumes amortization payments to resume in 1994
according to the payment schedule of the 1988 agreement. Moreover, the amortization of the RSTA and
PDI debt are scheduled for year 30. In contrast, Counterfactual II assumed an exchange of all debt
obligations for a 30 year bullet maturity instrument with the same interest as in Counterfactual I.

NOTE: The row for the Poland DDSR includes debt service for the additional funds provided by IFI's. The increased debt service
between the years 2005 and 2014 responds to the amortization period of new debt instruments with shorter maturities (i.e., Debt
Conversion Bonds, New Money Bonds, and PDI Bonds).
32.    As can be easily observed in Figure 2 and Table 7, the DDSR operation brought about significant
savings in nominal terms for Poland's debt service obligations. In fact, except for the up-front costs of
the operation, Poland will face significantly lower debt service obligations in the years to come.
Furthermore, the debt service peaks that are usually correlated with external crisis have to a large extent
disappeared. Therefore, though the new debt structure could be considered to be somewhat less flexible,
a significant reduction in debt service obligations has taken place.
33.    A  summary of the overall financial picture of this DDSR  operation can be obtained by
calculating the internal rate of return for the resulting cash flow savings. For the direct benefits to be



12
positive, the IRR should be higher than the domestic discount rate. For this DDSR operation the savings
relative to Counterfactual 11 result in an IRR of approximately 41 percent and are even higher relative to
Counterfactual 1 (59 percent). These IRR are in line with the levels calculated at the time of the RRP and
significantly above the domestic discount rate.

Indirect Benefits.
34.    The key characteristic of past DDSR operations has been that they have revitalized (both for the
private sector as well as the public sector) the access to international capital markets. Moreover, the
normalized relations with external creditors have usually helped to restore investor confidence. Poland
has been no exception. Following the DDSR operation several key indicators have substantially
improved, signaling the increased confidence of economic agents in the economy. Among these
indicators four are worth highlighting.
35.    First, the levels of foreign direct investment have been higher than in the past, signaling on one
hand a decrease in the country's risk premium and, on the other, the attractiveness of Poland resulting
from its important domestic market and skilled labor force. In fact, according to the government run
Polish Agency for Foreign Direct Investment, new equity investments for US$2.5 billion were made in
1995. This constitutes a marked increase over the US$1.6 billion and US$1.3 billion of foreign direct
investment observed, respectively, in 1993 and 1994. Moreover, the level of undisbursed commitments
were above US$5 billion at the end of 1995. The key sectors driving this impressive investment drive are
the electro-machinery industry, the food processing industry, and the private financial sector.

36.    Second, the improved confidence is also evidenced by a continuing decrease in real interest
rates. In Table 8 an annual real interest rate is presented which is based on the medium-term  nominal



13
inter-bank rate and a combined inflation rate based on the consumer price index and the producer price
index. This real interest rate has decreased from levels close to 13 percent a year in 1991 to levels above
4 percent a year in 1994 and slightly above 3 percent a year in 1995.
37.    Third, the capital account has been reflecting the restored confidence in the economy. For
example, substantial capital flows have entered the country which, as will be discussed later, have posed
new challenges to the macro framework. In fact, the conjunction of a surplus in the current account
(when adjusted for unrecorded cross-border trade and foreign tourism receipts) and the capital account,
have raised the net international reserve position of Poland to over US$15 billion by late 1995.
38.    Finally, since the agreement Poland has successfully completed a Eurobond issue for US$250
million with a yield of 185 basis points above the 5 year US Treasury Bond. This is an encouraging event
that signals Poland's return to voluntary international capital markets. Furthermore, this new bond issue
compares very favorably with those of other middle-income countries that have implemented DDSR
operations. For example, Argentina and Mexico have recently (February 1996) completed new bond
issues with yields of over 400 basis points above the 5 year US Treasury Bond (410 basis points and 445
basis points, respectively). Moreover, Poland's debt classifications by agencies such as Standard and
Poor's and Moody's have improved in the past few months. In particular, Moody's Investor Service
recently reclassified Poland's standing by making the country's debt eligible for investment by
institutional investors. Among those middle-income countries considered to be severely indebted in late
1989, Poland's investment grade is presently shared only with Chile.
F.     Sustainability.
39.    After over five years since the ETP began, it can be concluded that the program has been
successful in transforming a centrally planned economy into one in which many key activities are guided
by the market mechanism. Moreover, in those sectors in which public ownership is still high, the
government has shown its commitment to enforce hard budget constraints as a means to reduce the
strains on fiscal accounts and signal the need for further restructuring. The government has also tackled
in the last few years many of the deficiencies of the financial sector which had resulted in 1991 in a
seriously deteriorated loan portfolio. Also, the DDSR operation not only cleared the way for Poland's
access to international capital markets, but also reduced the uncertainties resulting from the burden of
external debt on fiscal and external accounts.
40.    Because of Poland's leadership and commitment to the transformation process, the country has
started to show the benefits of structural reforn. For example, Poland's real GDP has been growing at an
average annual rate of over 5 percent in the last three years and is expected to surpass this year its pre-
transition high, in effect becoming the first transition economy to achieve such recovery. To a significant
degree this encouraging performance has been spurred by the strong growth of the private sector which
now accounts for over 40 percent of output in industry and almost 60 percent of total GDP. Also, as
shown in Table 8, the growth of the private sector has been one of the key engines for Poland's economic
growth. Moreover, the country has not only expanded the volume of trade from slightly above 30 percent
of GDP in 1989 to almost 50 percent in 1995, but has also shifted the direction of trade from the
formerly centrally planned economies to the European Community. Furthermore, while the official
current account balance is still negative (above 2 percentage points of GDP), this measure has some
The list of middle-income countries considered to be severely-indebted in late 1989 was obtained from the World Bank
document Objective Measurement of External Debt Burden of Developing Countries - Technical Note, SecM89-1223, September
22, 1989. The data on country ratings was obtained from Bloomberg's on-line service and corresponds to ratings in effect in late
March, 1996.

methodological inconsistencies which exclude most receipts from foreign tourism and fail to record
cross-border trade. In fact, according to some estimates, correcting for such methodological problems in
actuality implies that there is a surplus in the current account. Thus, though there is no unique way to
make such corrections, there is a strong agreement among IFI's that Poland does not face --under the
current conditions-- an external resource constraint.
41.   In conclusion, the DDSR operation for Poland has enabled the country to strengthen its prospects
for sustained economic growth. Furthermore, while resuming debt service obligations constitutes a new
challenge for the economy, it is now set at low and predictable levels consistent with Poland's fiscal and
external accounts. For example, the Debt Service to Exports ratio will remain at levels only slightly
above 10 percent for the remaining of the decade. Also, as a percentage of Total Current Revenues, the
debt service obligations of Poland have come down from a high in 1989 of over 17 percent to a more
manageable level below 4 percent. This decrease signals not only a reduction on debt service obligations,
but also an improvement on the government's revenue collection efforts.
42.    Nonetheless, several risks remain for the Polish economy. First, Poland's main challenge is to
keep its fiscal accounts at levels consistent with available financing. This remains the single most
important concern on which the government should concentrate its efforts since many pending structural
reforms could quickly deteriorate the country's fiscal position (e.g., weakening in the financial discipline
of publicly owned enterprises in important economic sectors such as steel and coal or continuing delays
in tackling the urgently needed social security reform, particularly pension reform).
43.    Second, while the country is experiencing important capital inflows in part as result of the
restored confidence in the economy after the DDSR operation, it is important for these flows to be
closely monitored to avoid negative impacts for the macro framework. In fact, if these flows were to
expand beyond present levels, the lack of appropriate policy reaction to aggressively curtail them could
result in an acceleration of inflation and a real appreciation of the zloty. As a result, the current account
could rapidly deteriorate. In this framework, the best policy for the government is to improve its fiscal
position in order to reduce its exposure to the mood of capital flows and to follow an effective
sterilization policy aimed at reducing the risks of unsustainable increases in private consumption. Also,
to successfully accomplish an economic integration with the European Community, it is important for
the country to increase the total level of domestic savings (both public as well as private). In this regard,
it is also essential to accelerate the pace of privatization to maintain the confidence of investors
(domestic and foreign) on the ongoing reform process.
44.    Overall, the country's prospects are encouraging and, to a large extent, have been enhanced by
the improved investment climate resulting from the DDSR operation. Furthermore, the outcome to the
country's electoral process of late 1995 has been received without major concerns by economic agents in
general and the business community in particular. This smooth political transition should be credited to
the new government which, while highlighting the need to change the emphasis on some aspects of
economic policy, has so far signaled its intention to maintain the key components of the economic
program. Nonetheless, as highlighted in previous paragraphs, much remains to be done. In particular, it is
essential for Poland to address the pending structural reforms, many of which require a high degree of
political will. Hopefully, the government will recognize that these reforms are needed to consolidate the
encouraging economic growth rates of recent years.
G.    Bank and Borrower Performance.
45.    The Bank staff provided the Government with technical advice and assessed in a timely fashion
the alternative options being discussed between the country and its creditors. Also, the Bank at the outset



15
notified the authorities of Poland that Bank financing for a DDSR operation would require an agreement
consistent with Poland's fiscal accounts. Furthermore, the borrower put forward a strong negotiating and
technical team that deserves most of the credit for the successful completion of this DDSR operation.
Overall, the Bank and the Borrower performance has been outstanding, demonstrating a high degree of
close collaboration between them and with other institutions (such as the IMF) and bilateral creditors.
46.    Prior to the implementation of the DDSR operation, the Government of Poland requested support
in strengthening several institutional capabilities related to debt issues. As a result, in January of 1991
key support was received by Poland through two technical assistance projects funded by the Japanese
Trust Fund. The first project, in the amended amount of approximately 29 million of Japanese Yens
(Financial Technical Assistance Project), provided grant funds to strengthen the country's institutional
capabilities in debt management and to develop the country's statistical and accounting capabilities. The
funds financed technical support, staff training, and specialized equipment. The second technical
assistance project (Legal Assistance in Debt Negotiation Project) provided legal assistance support
required by the Government of Poland for the successful completion of its debt negotiations. The
amended amount of this project was over 122 million of Japanese Yens. These two projects as well as
other technical assistance provided by the US Treasury were instrumental for the successful completion
of this DDSR operation and highlight the key role played by donor countries.
47.    The implementation of this operation was smooth except for the fact that the Bank was unable to
disburse the funds at the time the deal was closed because the country had still not complied with the
administrative and legal requirements for the disbursement of funds (e.g., certified copies of appropriate
official documents, legal opinion presented by the country stating that all the agreements entered into
were duly authorized, etc.). While this was solved through an interim arrangement in which the National
Bank of Poland advanced the funds, it does contrast with the ease with which IMF funds for DDSR
operations can be disbursed. Nonetheless, to a large extent the delay has to be attributed to the short
period between Board approval (October 25) and the date in which the agreement with commercial banks
was signed (October 27).
H.    Findings and Lessons.
48.    Poland's successful DDSR operation should be credited to two factors. First, it benefited from
the strong support offered by the international community. This support manifested in tangible signs
such as the Stabilization Fund of 1989 and the significant debt reduction and debt service reduction
provided by the Paris Club. Second, the government committed to the reform process. In this respect, the
Economic Transformation Program proved to be comprehensive and bold. Furthermore, when
deficiencies emerged, the government took the required steps to quickly and decisively address them. As
one example, such was the case during the banking sector crisis in 1991.
49.    Several lessons can be derived from this DDSR loan, some of which have also been noted in
previous Bank supported DDSR operations. First, since the debtor country will incur high up-front costs,
it makes more sense for DDSR operations to follow rather than lead the country's economic reform
process. More specifically, such costs are justified only when the country has addressed the sources of
the debt crisis. Furthermore, economic reform by itself will pose sufficient challenges for the country
undertaking them and will require a tight fiscal control. Hence, it is not a matter of chance that most
highly-indebted countries first initiated the reform process, while many times in arrears with their
commercial creditors, and only then tackled their external debt problem. Also, a DDSR agreement
reduces the flexibility of the debt structure and partially shifts the burden from private creditors to
official creditors (both bilateral as well as multilateral). Thus, it is in the Bank's own interest and in that



16
of its shareholders to ensure that support is being given only when it enhances the country's potential
success for an ongoing reform program.
50.    Second, as has been the case in most highly-indebted countries, DDSR operations provide
significant indirect benefits by restoring the country's access to international capital markets. This
suggests that there are fundamental strengths in voluntary market-based resolutions of the debt problem
since both creditors and debtors share in the efficiency gains derived. In this respect, the key
characteristic of this DDSR operation in Poland is that significant levels of debt and debt service
reduction were obtained (a DRE of close to 60 percent of eligible debt, see Table 5) and that an
important fraction of the gains due to the country's reduced risk were reaped by Poland (close to three
fifths of total gains, see Table 6). While the reasons behind Poland's excellent outcome from the deal are
many, the inclusion in the Paris Club agreement of a commitment to provide comparable treatment to
official and private creditors stands out as its key characteristic. Hence, one must conclude that while
voluntary market-based solutions to the debt crisis are strictly preferred to mandatory solutions, strong
signals from the international community regarding the expected level of debt and debt service reduction
can be beneficial to ensure an operation that strengthens the country's growth prospects. Also, the
government's commitment to have an economic program supported by the IMF prior to April 1994 (i.e.,
the scheduled date for the implementation of the second phase of the Paris Club agreement) provided the
necessary incentives to trigger the policy decisions required to successfully complete the DDSR
operation while enhancing the benefits derived from it.
51.    Finally, as in other DDSR operations, the selection of par bonds seems to have been sensitive to
the market conditions of interest rates in the interim period between when the Head of Terms were
signed (March 1994) and the actual signing of the deal (October 1994). For example, while in the DDSR
for Argentina the market interest rates decreased during this interim period and, as a result, many
creditors opted for the consequently under-priced par bond options, the opposite happened in the DDSR
for Poland. To reduce the sensitivity of options to short-term market conditions, it could be worthwhile
to design more flexible instruments that would help maintain a balance among them at the time the final
selection is made. Such flexibility can be accomplished through instruments where interest rates during
the interim period are defined as a percentage of a given reference rate. In such case, the actual rate of
the newly issued par bonds would be locked only once the deal is effected (or shortly before) and the
prevailing reference rate is known. Alternatively, the parties involved should try to reduce as much as
possible the period between the agreement on the Head of Terms and the actual implementation of the
deal.
