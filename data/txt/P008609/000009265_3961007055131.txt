OEBT AND DEBT SERVICE RLOUCTION LOAN
Loan anid Program Summary
Borrower.          Republic o, Poland
Amount:            US$170 million equivalent Debt and Debt Service Reduction Loan.
Terms:             Repayable in 17 years, including 5 years grace, at the standard variable interest
rate.
Description:       The proposed loan would accompany the release of US$230 million equivalent
that were set aside under three adjustnent operations now under implementation
(US$30 million from the Financial Institutions Development Loan (FIDL 3341-
POL), US$100 million from the Agriculture Sector Adjustment Loan (ASAL
3600-POL), and US$100 million from the Enterprise and Financial Sector
Adjustment Loan (EFSAL 3359-POL)). The proposed loan and the Set-Asides,
for a total of US$400 million equivalent, would reimburse the Government of
Poland for part of the costs expected to be incurred in connection with the
implementation of the Debt and Debt Service Reduction (DDSR) Program
pursuant to the 1994 Financing Plan. The program includes a reduction of the
approximately US$14.3 billion debt and past due interest (PDI) through a menu
of options. The menu includes: (A) for the debt previously rescheduled under the
1988 Restructuring Agreement (DDRA): 30-year 45 percent discount bonds at
market rates (LIBOR plus 13/16) with full collateral for principal at matuity; 30-
year par bonds bearing below-market fixed interest rate with full collateral for
principal at maturity; a new money option, including 25-year debt-conversion par
bonds bearing below-market fixed interest rates, and 15-year new money par
bonds at market rates (LIBOR plus 13/16), equivalent to 35 percent of the debt
conversion bonds; and a buy-back of long-term debt and its related PDI at 41
cents on the dollar. (B) For the debt under the Revolving Short Tem  Trade
Related Facility Agreement (RSTA): 30-year par bonds bearing below-market
fixed interest rate with full collateral for principal at maturity; buy-back of RSTA
obligations and its related PDI at 38 cents on the dollar. (C) Past Due Interest:
all PDI not cleared under the previous options will be converted into 20-year PDM
par bonds bearing below-market fixed interest rates.
A limited waiver of the terms of the negative pledge clauses in the loan and
guarantee agreements between the World Bank and the Republic of Poland is also
proposed, to allow the pledge of collateral in the amounts required for the
discount bonds, par bonds and RSTA bonds to be issued by Poland.
The World Bank's support to the DDSR operation would be complemented by
support from the IMF for an equivalent amount, in the fonn of release of Set-
Asides from the on-going Stand-by arrangement and augnentation funds
equivalent to about 15 percent of Poland's IF quota. The remiainder of the
financing costs (estimated at US$2.1 billion) would be provided from Poland's
own reserves, which stood at over US$1 I billion at end-August (over 7 months
of imports).



Benefits and Riskss:  With the completion of the London Club deal, which follows the implementation
in April 1994 of the second phase of the Paris Club debt reduction agreement,
Poland will hr.e virtually completed the regularization of its payment status with
its external creditors. This will eliminate a source of business uncertainty at a
time when the improvement in economic conditions is making the country an
attractive place for foreign investment, and will contribute to increasing its
productive potential and its medium- and long-term rate of growth.
The main concen with regard to the operation is presented by the greater
inflexibility of the resulting debt structure afier the execution of the DDSR, which
could endanger repayments to the Bank were economic conditions to deteriorate
in the future. This risk would be compounded by slippage on the economic
policy fiont. While this cannot be altogether excluded, particularly over a long
term horizon, present policies in Poland are broadly consistent with an optimistic
outlook. The ability of the Govemment to implement its own reform agenda,
which continues to stress the priorities of the past four years, will be the key
factor to extend to the medium-term the successful performance of the past two
years.
Disbursement.      The proposed loan would be disbursed in one tranche, along with the release of
the Set-Asides, to finance the buy-back portion of the DDSR deal.
Rate of Return:    The intemal rate of return on the financial resources allocated to the Agreement,
based on the savings in payments to commercial banks, would be 40 percent.

REPORT AND RECOAMMNATION OF THE PRESIDENT OF THE
INTERNATIONAL BANK FOR RECONSTRUCTION AND DEVELOPMENT
TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS
ON A PROPOSED DEBT AND DEBT SERVICE
REDUCTION LOAN
IN AN AMOUNT EQUIVALENT TO US$170 MILLION
TO THE REPUBLIC OF POLAND
AND ON RELATED MEASURES TO SUPPORT
THE DEBT REDUCTION PROGRAM
OF THE REPUBLIC OF POLAND
1.    I submit the following report and recommendation for proposed measures to support the RepubUic
of Poland in the implementation of its Debt and Debt Service Reduction (DDSR) agreement with the
commercial bank creditors of the London Club.'  Poland's total commercial debt eligible for this
operation is estimated at about US$14.3 billion. This includes all principal and principal arrears (US$8.8
billion), all past due interest (US$4.3 billion), as well as short-tenn trade financing facilities (US$1.2
billion). The agreement includes: (i) an uxchange of commercial debt holdings for a menu of options
including new collateralized instruments to be issued by Poland, a buy-back, and a new money option;
and (ii) regularization of all past due interest (PDI) through additional payments to be made between the
date of the agreement and the closing date of the deal, and an exchange of all remaining arrears for ?DI
bonds. The expected closing date is October 27, 1994.
2.    The proposed World Bank support for this operation involves the following elements:
a      Release of Set-Asides of US$230 million equivalent provided for under existing
adjustment lending operations (US$30 million from the Financial Institutions Development
Loan (FIDL 3341-POL), US$100 million from the Agriculture Sector Adjustment Loan
(ASAL 3600-POL), and US$100 million from the Enterprise and Financial Sector
Adjustment Loan (EFSAL 3359-POL)).
b.    A Debt and Debt Service Reduction Loan to the Republic of Poland for US$170 million
equivalent to reimburse for expenditures incunred in financing a portion of the debt
buy-back;
c.    A limited waiver of the negative pledge clauses in loan and guarantee agreements between
the Republic of Poland and the World Bank, to pernit a pledge of collateral for the debt
instruments to be issued under the DDSR operation.
See "Poland: Preliminary Agreement on a Commercial Bank Debt and Debt Service Reduction
Operation (DDSR) - Briefing Note" (April 13, 1994, SecM94-375).

I. Introduction
3.    This memorandum analyzes the proposed DDSR operation and discusses its effects on the r edium
temn outlook and creditworthiness of the Polish economy. It also provides a justification for the use of
World Bank resources to support this operation. Section II provides background infornation on economic
developments that followed the implementation of Poland's 1990 economic reform program, and discusses
medium term economic prospects and policies. Sections III and IV deal with the debt stnrtegy followed
in the last few years, describe in more detail the main features of the DDSR agreement, and provide an
evaluation of the deal, its cash flow implications, and a comparison with other similar DDSR operations.
Section V discusses the impact of the agreement on the overall medium term economic outlook and
creditworthiness in the context of the DDSR. Finally, section VI discusses the Bank's assistance strategy
and the proposed DDSR operation.
II. The Economy'
Background: Four Years of Reform
4.    Poland was the first country in Eastern Europe to launch a radical plan of economic and political
transformation in 1989/90. At that time the country was in a severe hyperinflation, her external accounts
were rapidly deteriorating, and access to international financing had all but disappeared. Four years afker
the launching of the Economic Transformation Program of January 1, 1990, Poland registered the highest
growth rate in Europe in 1993 (save Albania); prospects for 1994 and beyond are encouraging.
5.    Achieving this success has not been without costs or setbacks. A sharp recession was experienced
in the first two years of the program. The fall in real wages that followed the price liberalization and the
abolition of subsidies led to a sharp contraction of domestic demand, with consumption and investment
by State-Owned Enterprises (SOEs) collapsing. In 1991 the economy was severely affected by the
collapse of the CMEA, which still accounted for a significant part of exteral trade, despite the impressive
gains that had been made in western marckets penetration. Large and overmanned SOEs were unable to
react to the changing conditions and were significantly affected, leading to a further decline in investment.
Despite the expansion of exports towards European markets and a rebound in consumption, output
continued to fall, for a cumulative decline of almost 20 percent for the period 1990-91.
6.    Once the CMEA shock was absorbed, the economy began to respond positively to the newly
changed environment. The initial growth stimulus was provided by the strong expansion of exports to
the European markets. Soon, however, the recovery became largely driven by increasing domestic
demand. Total consumption rose strongly, by some 5-6 percent in 1992 and 1993, despite slow or no
growth in real incomes for some segments of the population. Private consumption per-capita, measured
in constant prices, is therefore almost back at the levels of the late 1980s. Growth of investment in fixed
capital also tumed positive, largely driven by private sector activity.
2  Poland's economic policies and prospects are reviewed in greater detail in the 1994 Country Economic
Memorandum: " Growth with Equity - Policies for the 1990s", report n. 13039-POL, September 1994.



- 3 -
7.    As a result of these trends in domestic demand, total output recovered in 1992-93 by a cumulative
growth of 6 percent, mainly reflecting a marked dynamism in private sector activity. In parallel, the
external accounts weakened. with a worsening of the recorded current account balance by some US$2.0
billion between 1992 and 1993 (for a deficit of about US$2.3 billion or about 2.6 percent of GDP).
Poland has nevertheless continued to accumulate sizeable external reserves (which in August 1994 stood
at over US$11 billion, or over 7 months of imports), a development due to a combination of unidentified
capital flows and/or unrecorded net exports.
InkplemenAion of Poles
8.    Stabilization and Fiscal Policy. The positive results of the past two yeas are atributable to
success in the implementation of the package of stabilization and progress on structural policies. Central
to both has been the fiscal adjustment that was obtained in the past two years. The outcome for 1993,
showing a modest deficit of some 2.4 percent of GDP, provides the platform on which a medium-tenn
program of public finance reform can be built. Public savings tumed positive, partly compensating for
the shatp drop in savings of the rest of   economy The public sector's demands on the limited domestic
credit were correspondingly reduced.
9.    Much remains to be done in the public finance area. Considerable progress has been made with
regard to the implementation of a program  of tax reform. Many of the ad-hoc taxes of the past have been
abolished and replaced by broad-based, modern taxes. The implementation of the VAT in July 1993 was
successful, and tax policy is close to bringing a European structure of taxation to Poland. But a
substantial strengthening of tax administration is required to prevent a deterioration of the tax system. On
the expenditure side, many of the structural problems that emerged in the recent past have been postponed
rather than solved. The discontinuation of many of the expenditure functions of the old system has gone
hand-in-glove with rapid growth in social programs. The state has had to absorb a disproportionate share
of the costs of the economic adjustment and of the reduction in labor force associated with the economic
transformation. For this reasons, there is now need to bring decisive reforn to public finances both to
prevent expenditure explosions that are built into the current programs, to reduce the size of the state, and
to improve the delivery and targeting of services and transfers to the population.
10.   Financial Sector and Enterprise Refiorms. Substantial difficulties surfaced in the SOE and
financial sectors shortly after economic reforms began in 1990. By late 1991 Poland was faced, as were
most other former socialist countries, with a grave deterioration of the portfolio of the banking system,
primarily (but not exclusively) due to the crisis in the SOE sector. Aside from the fiscal implications of
the large losses (amounting, in the case of Poland's commercial banks, to some forty percent of assets),
the Govemment was confronted with a double challenge. On the one hand, it wanted to find a solution
to the problem that would minimize the loss of productive capacity and employment, when economic
conditions justified it. On the other hand, it had to deal with considerable institutional weakness within
the Government machineiy itself, the court system, and the banks. After a careful consideration of relative
risks, the Government decided, in March 1993, to decentralize to the Treasury-owned commercial banks
the task of restucturing the eniterprises that had failed to adapt to the new market conditions, and to
recapitalize the public commercial banks for that purpose. One year into program implementation,
indications are that the test was passed successfully and that it contributed to instilling in the commercial



-4 -
banks much-needed skills and a stronger market orientation. These positive developments were made
possible, inter alia, by an ongoing program  of institutional development, which includes "twinnings"
between the Polish banks and foreign commercial banks, that was supported by the World Bank's FIDL.
11.   While progress has been encouraging in the case of the commercial banks, important problems
have not been addressed (or have surfaced anew) with regard to specialized banks and the private banks.
The strategy for restructuring and privatization of the specialized banks has not been formulated with
precision, and at least two of them, accounting for a substantial majority of household deposits, are in
a state of severe crisis. Several private banks have required intervention from the National Bank of
Poland (NBP).
12.   Privatization and Private Sector Development. Private sector expansion has been strong both
because of privatization and because of free entry of enterpreneurs. The private sector now accounts for
over half of GDP. However, privatization is one of the areas where progress, particularly in recent times,
has been below the high, initial expectations. By December 30, 1993 (three and a half years into tWl
implementation of the privatization program) 2,098 State Owned Enterprises had been privatized, as
recorded by the Ministry of Privatization, or about 25 percent of the original number, against 1,621 one
year before. Proceeds from privatization for the year exceeded US$400 million. -gainst US$360 million
in 1992. An additional "23 enterprises have been commercialized but not yet pe- ' A td; presently owned
by the State Treasury, they are waiting to be privatized through capital privatization or mass privatization.
T-he estimated total manpower of privatized enterprises at the time of actual r- _ization is between
500,000 and 600,000 employees.
Economic Prospectsfor 1994 and Beyond
13.   Poland's economic targets for 1994 envisage continued growth in output (4.5 percent), a further
reduction in inflation to 23 percent by end-year, and a further accumulation of intenational reserves. The
instruments announced to support these targets consist of a slightly expansionary fiscal stance (with the
deficit targeted to increase by about 1 percent of GDP), a monetary policy aiming at growth in domestic
credit compatible with the macroeconomic targets, and targeted at reducing interest rates in line with the
reduction in inflation, and an exchange rate policy which would maintain the pace of the crawl slightly
below the rate of inflation. The program is supported by an IMF 19-month SDR545 million Stand-by
arrangement that was approved by the IMF board on August 5, 1994.
14.   While there are good reasons for optimism, as evidenced by the continued positive trends in the
first half of 1994, control over policies should not be relaxed. The relaxation of wage controls at the end
of 1993 led to excessive wage awards, which, in combination with other factors, make it very likely that
the 1994 inflation will overshoot its official targets, perhaps by 4-5 percentage points. The recovery also
originated from a strong performance of domestic demand, particularly consumption. As a result, national
savings declined for the third year in a row (although official data may overestimate this phenomenon)
and currently stand at about 16 percent of GDP. This trend cannot be sustained much longer without
consequences for stability and external viability. More fundamnentally, Poland needs to continue to
increase her productivity if the prospect of joining the European Union is to become a reality around the
tum of the century. In this respect, it is notable that the share of investment at about 19 percent of GDP
remains substantially below the level of the 1980s. While the high investment ratios of the old system
reflected inefficient use of capital resources and the distorted structure of relative prices of capital goods,



the resources currently devoted by Poland to investment, even discounting for under-reporting for tax
evasion purposes, appear low compared to those of countries that have experienced prolonged periods of
sustained economic growth. Recent data, however, indicate that exports have increased substantially in
1994, with Poland able to take advantage of the recovery in the rest of Europe, and that investment
expenditures may also be posting a strong showing.
1S.   On the supply side, as was t&e case at the beginning of the economic transformation, the recovery
is spurred by strong growth of the private sector, which now accounts for over one third of output in
industry alone. In the SOE sector, a dual pattern of behavior seems to have emerged. On the one hand,
a large group of SOEs appears to have been able to rstructure its operations and to adapt, albeit to a
limited extent, to the new market conditions. These enterprises are now the best candidates for
privatization. On the other hand, a second, powerfil group of largc, mostly capital intensive SOEs
(employing perhaps some 15-20 percent of the industrial labor force, and concentrated in coal mining,
steel, shipbuilding, transportation, and, outrside industy, in the railways and in the wholesale and retail
trade still in state hands) has adopted a strongly defensive attitude, utilizing its political bargaining power
and refusing to carry out painful but needed adjustment measures. These enterprises pose a severe burden
now, and a considerable policy dilemma for the fiture. The size and importance of these enterprises,
however, makes the resolution of their fnancial problems essential for the long-term health of the country.
16.   The medium term external financing outlook for Poland is discussed below. Owing in pait to the
DDSR operation, it can be expected that Poland will be able to grow at a relatively fast rate for the
remainder of this decade. Sustaining the recovery will however hinge on a reversal of the downward trend
in national savings,just mentioned. The growth of consumption that has fuelled the recovery from the
1990-91 recession should give way to a more balanced growth path. Policies to shore up the recovery
and address the medium-tenn savings and investment needs must emphasize, among other things, a
fundamental reform of public finances, particularly the most important social expenditure programs; and
progress in reforms in the financial sector and in privatization of state enterprises.

Background
FdPSND: ExerNe Debt StWudue
17.   Poland's extemal debt problems              (pementoft  debt. nd-1993)
are rooted in the 1970s attempts to                       ow
modernize  the economy, relying on               es §7X
heavy imports of foreign machinery and           40  
equipment, and made possible by the
willingness of official and private
lenders alike to extend unprecedented   ,,,,k l
amounts of credit to hitherto unexplored  26s                             Pais,Db
markets. The rapid increase in extemal             -2%
debt became unsustainable towards the
end of the 1970s, as it was increasingly         Tot E2dmm Deb: US$47.7 blle
evident that the economic reforns had
failed to deliver the growth they had



-6-
promised, and Polish society began its long struggle to replace its economic system. The imposition of
martial law in 1981 and Mexico's default on its external debt in 1982 precipitated the debt crisis for
Poland as well.
18.   Starting in the early 1980s Poland was thus forced to seek new agreements with external creditors.
Six rescheduling or consolidation agreements with commercial bank creditors were signed in the 1980s.
The last one, covering almost all medium and long term obligations to commercial banks, was signed on
July 1988 and was meant to provide a comprehensive solution to the repeated failure of the previous
agreements. Interest payments to commercial banks continued in full until September of 1989, and some
of the anortization payments were rescheduled as needed. In the last quarter of 1989, in the midst of its
political and economic crisis, Poland ceased fully to service its commercial debt, except for trade-related
roll-over facilities.
19.   The political and economic events that culminated in the 1989 Round-Table agreement and the
end of the communist era in Poland, led to the international recognition of the need to provide substantial
external support to the reforms, which were facing daunting challenges. By the end of 1990 the official
creditors of the Paris Club began discussions with the Polish authorities on a restructuring agreement that
could involve substantial debt forgiveness. A rescheduling agreement, involving US$10.4 billion of pre-
cutoff date obligations was signed in February 1990. The subsequent agreement reached in April 1991
provided for an unprecedented 50 percent reduction of Poland's debt on a net present value basis. This
would be achieved in two phases: a 30 percent reduction for the period 1991-94. to be accomplished
mainly through an 80 percent forgiveness of interest payments for the three-year period; and an additional
20 percent, in April 1994, through a menu option approach including interest and principal reduction (see
Annex II).
20.   The agreement also included a commitment from the Polish Government to seek a reduction in
its debt obligations towards all creditors other than IFIs, including its commercial bank creditors, on terns
"comparable" to those granted by the
Paris Club.

21.   Almost in parallel, and in the
context of the ongoing Brady initiative        POLAND: Sbucltkm of Cemmercsd Debt
for debt and debt service reduction              (perent of tot deb end-1 93
(DDSR), Poland started negotiations on
a DDSR agreement with its commercial
bank creditors.  After a few initial
meetings, however, discussions stalled     PoI
over the issue of the treatment of the     27.2_
past due interest (PDI). The resignation
of the Polish debt negotiator in late
1991,  and  subsequent  political
uncertainty due to successive
Govemment changes led to a complete               Tot Comml Debt US1V2.7 billio

IV. The London Club Debt Agreement
Bawkground
24. Negotiations with the creditors of the London Club on a possible DDSR began in early 1991 under
a set of principles presented by the Polish authorities. The first argued that Poland's future external and
fiscal position should be considered a major pameter in designing a viable long-ternn solution to the
external commercial debt problem. The second argued that "comparable" treatment should be established
between official and commercial creditors. Within this framework, by mid-1991 the Polish delegation
made available a comprehensive proposal to its commercial creditors along the lines of a Brady-type
arangement.
25. The commercial banks focussed on the accumulated past due interest (PDI), which by mid-1991
amounted to about US$1.3 billion. The resignation of the Polish debt negotiator and the political
uncertainty due to successive Government changes led to the discussed halt of the negotiating process.
26. Negotiations resumed in early 1993, after the appointment of a new debt negotiator. Agreement on
a Head of Terms was reached on March 10, 1994, and a fonnal Financing Proposal was issued on May
23, 1994. The options envisaged in the proposal allowed creditors holding long-term debt, revolving trade
financing facilities, and their related past due interest (PDI), to exchange their claims using a menu option
approach.
27. The Paris Club reviewed the Head of Terns at a meeting in April 1994, and found them to be in
compliance with the requirements of comparable treatment. It thus authorized the second phase of the
reduction of debt to official creditors as discussed above.
EIigJke Debt
28. The Eligible Debt estimated at end-October 1994 (target date for the exchange of instruments)
amounts to US$14.3 billion. Of this amount, US$8.8 billion is principal due under the DDRA (1988
Restructuring Agreement); US$4.3 billion is first- and second-generation PDI on the DDRA; and US$1.2
billion is principal and PDI due on the RSTA (Revolving Short-Term Agreement) facility (see Table 1).
Menu of Optins
29. The menu of options to exchange the commercial debt includes:
DDRA - 1988 Restructwing Aeement - Long-tem debt
a.    30-year 45 percent discount bonds at market rates (LIBOR plus 13/16) with full collateral for
principal at maturity.
b.    30-year par bonds bearing below-market fixed interest rate with full collateral for principal at
maturity.
c.    New money option, including 25-year debt-conversion par bonds bearing below-market fixed
interest rates, and 15-year new money par bonds at market rates (LIBOR plus 13/16), equivalent
to 35 percent of the debt conversion bonds.
d.    Buy-back of long-term debt and its related PD)I at 41 cents on the dollar.



- 10-
* RSTA - Revolving Short Term Trade Facilities
e.    30-year RSTA par bonds bearing below-market fixed interest rate with full collateral for
principal at maturity.
f     Buy-back of RSTA obligations and its related PDI at 38 cents on the dollar.
* Past Due Interest
g.    All PDI not cleared under options d and f will be converted into 20-year PDI par bonds bearing
below market fixed interest rates.
* Other
h.    Additional provisions apply to interest payments falling due from the date of the agreement until
the date of exchange, as well as to additional up-front payments to increase the level of interest
paid from May 1993. Detailed provisions are also specified for the treatment of second and
later generations of interest as well as for penalty clauses.
30. The Government also announced that it will introduce a program of debt-equity swaps for
consideration of Parliament. All instuments exchanged would be eligible to participate, within the limits
set by the program.
Up-ftont Costs and Financing Plan of the DDSR Operation
31. On August 26, 1994 the Polish Govermnent announced that it had received commitments and the
necessary waivers fiom creditors holding about 99 percent of Eligible Debt. Discount bonds attacted
about 60 percent of eligible DDRA debt, and the buy-back was selected by about a quartr of DDRA and
RSTA creditors. The available new money option (5 percent of DDRA debt) was almost entirely
subscribed. The low interest shown in the DDRA par bond is explained largely by the upward movements
in the market structure of interest rates since the term sheets were finalized in May 1994. Based on recent
exchange and interest rates and the choice of options by creditors, the financing requirements for the
DDSR operation are estimated at about US$2.1 billion, a figure that will be adjusted depending on the
final tally of options selections, as well as the exchange and interest rates prevailing at the time of closing
(see table 3 for the calculations based on the current estimates of distribution of options). Catch-up
interest payments plus up-front cancellation of arrears amount to US$158 million. Buy-back costs would
amount to approximately US$1.3 billion, and an additional amount of approximately US$600 million
would be required for the purchase of collateral.
32. Financing Plan. The Polish Govenmment intends to finance the up-front costs of the deal thrugh
a combination of own reserves and loans from the World Bank and the IMF. Given the timing of the
closing of the operation, tl - Govemment has also made arrangements with the National Bank of Poland
for bridge financing between the closing date and such time when the IMF and World Bank resources
would become available.

33. Under IMF guidelines, Poland can apply for Set-Asides and augmentation funds in support of a
DDSR operation. Following the approval of the new IMF SDR545 million Stand-by on August 5, 1994,
the Set-Asides that existed under the Stand-by that expired in March 1994 were reinstated, and Set-Asides
in the amount of 25 percent of the first tranche were made available, for a total of SDR135 million.
Poland can furthermore request up to 30 percent of its quota of SDR988 million in augmentation funds,



- 12 -
for a maximum of SDR286 million. The authorities have requested augmentation in the amount of about
15 percent of quota. This would bring the IMF total contribution to about SDR280 million, or about
US$400 million at current exchange rates. The IMF Board is expected to consider the request on October
26, 1994.
34. The modalities of the proposed World Bank financing (US$230 million equivalent in Set-Asides and
US$170 million equivalent in the form of a stand-alone DDSR loan, for a total of US$400 million
equivalent) are discussed below (section VI). Participation from Polish reserves is thus likely to be
required in the amount of US$1.3 billion. This does not appear to be an undue burden, given the current
level of Net International Reserves noted above (over US$11 billion at end-August).
Debt Service Implications
35. Based on the DDSR scenario just described, it is possible to estimate the debt service implications
of the DDSR operation on the balance of payments and on the Polish budget. The path of debt service
payments can be divided into three phases: (i) the fist six years, when only interest payments are due on
all instruments (discount bonds, par bonds, RSTA bonds, and PDI bonds); (ii) the period between years
7 and 20, when amortization on the PDI and on the new money option is scheduled; and (iii) the period
between years 21 and 30 when amortization is due only on the debt conversion component of the new
money option, and interest is due in all remaining instruments (The amortization of par and discount
bonds in year 30, is paid off with the redemption of the collateral fund).
36. Debt service would average over US$400 million per annum during the first phase (Table 5a), and
would increase to almost US$700 million per annum during the second phase, when the amortization of
the PDI takes place (this would be equivalent to about 0.4 percent of GDP, on average). Debt Service
would decline slightly during the third phase to about US$400 per annum.
37. Debt service relieffirom DDSR operation. Poland would obtain substantial debt service relief from
the DDSR operation. To quantify these savings, it is necessary to establish a good counterfactual to the
DDSR operation. As mentioned, Poland was only partially servicing interest on its commercial debt, and
no amortization payments were made in the last three years, therefore opening a range of possibilities to
define an appropriate counterfactual. We have analyzed two possible counterfactuals. In Counterfactual
I, we assume that in the absence of a DDSR, Poland would have made interest payments on the entire
amount of principal and interest arrears at market interest rates (LIBOR + 13/16), and would have
restarted amortization payments sometime in 1994 according to the payment schedule in the last agreement
with the London Club (1988). The amortization of RSTA and of principal and interest arrears is
scheduled for the year 30. Counterfactual II assumes an exchange of all debt obligations for 30-year
bullet maturity instmments and all interest service at market interest rates.
38. As shown in Table 5b, the DDSR operation would generate substantial debt service relief during the
next decade under both counterfactuals. Relief is higher during the first decade under counterfactual I,
and for the final years under counterfactual II. Using counterfactual 1, during the rest of the decade,
average annual debt service relief is about US$1.1 billion, roughly divided between interest and
amortization relief. During the period 2001 to 2014, debt service relief will be only Mioderate, mostly
from interest relief. At a later stage (2015-2024) average debt service relief will increase again to about

US$1.5 billion reflecting repayment of arears and the RSTA. Counterfactual II shows a more moderate
service relief during the first years of the DDSR, mostly due to the moderate contribution of amortization
relief as it assumes that all debt will be exchanged by 30-year bullet maturity instruments. The later
increase in amortization relief towards the end of the DDSR period reflects the maturity of all debt
instruments at the end of the DDSR period.

39. DRE calculations. The standard method to appraise the extent of the debt reduction of a DDSR
package is the Debt Reduction Equivalent (DRE)4. This methodology takes into account the immediate
4     The methodology is discussed in Analtical Aspects of Debt and Debt Servce Reduction Operations
SecM92-296, March 2, 1992; and 1992 World Debt Tables vol. 1, p. 28.

reduction in the face value of the debt that is obtained through the buy-back and the discount bonds, the
present value reduction in the debt due to the lower-than-market interest rates on the par bonds and the
PDI bonds, and the prepayment of the principal collateral on discount and par bonds, which will be held
in a secured account beyond the control of the Polish authorities. Table 6 presents a calculation of the
reduction for Poland. Based on the preliminary distribution of the different DDSR options, the DRE is
calculated at about 60 percent. This compares very favorably with the average DRE of all past DDSR
operations (about 42 percent).
40. Comprehensiveness of DDSR Operation. Table 7 shows the break-even prices and the post-deal
prices for the uncollateralized portion of the remaining debt for past DDSR operations. These prices
(based on early information on trading in futures for Polish Brady bonds) show that Poland would obtain
considerable material benefits from the reduction operation. The calculated break-even price, at 51 cents
on the dollar, is 39 percent lower than the post-deal price of 84 cents. This reduction is among the highest
of all preceding operations, a reflection of the deep discount obtained by Poland, but also of the surge in
confidence in the Polish economy following the announcement of the agreement. Given a pre-deal
reference price of 30 cents, these calculations imply that Poland is reaping some 61 percent of the
market's reduced perception of Polish risk.
41. Material Benefits. The material benefits of a debt reduction operation relate not only to the changed
path of externat debt servicing and debt relief, but, in a much more important way, to the behavior of
domestic and foreign investment flows, and to the effects of increased confidence on general economic
activity. As noted before, the proposed DDSR operation follows on the heels of the much greater (in
absolute terms) reduction in Paris Club debt, and, when completed, will dispel a measurable degree of
uncertainty with respect to domestic and external debt servicing that has existed until now.
42. Reduced uncertainty will stem both from smoother and more predictable debt service obligations and
from the normalization of the relationship with foreign commercial creditors. The DDSR operation will
smooth out the pattern of debt service payments over a 30-year period. This will make debt service more
predictable and it will avoid the peaks of debt repayment which, in many developing countries, are
associated with exchange rate crises and, therefore, high interest rate premia and low investment. In
addition, as regular debt service resumes, the perceived risk of investing in/lending to Poland will decrease
(partly, because the potential cost of debt service default after the deal will increase). For bath reasons,
private capital inflows are likely to rise and interest rates are likely to drop, thus, fostering investment and
economic growth, and further strengthening debt repayment capacity.
43. With the London Club DDSR, Poland will have removed the last important obstacle to the
normalization of relations with external creditors. There is now great international investors' interest in
Poland, as the country appears to have successfully stabilized its economy, and the size of the intenal
market as well as the skills of its labor force make it an atactive location for foreign direct investment.
Poland, as discussed, is also planning to offer a debt-equity swap program, which will facilitate direct
equity investment. In addition, Poland is planning to test the markets immediately following the
conclusion of the debt deal with a bond issue, whose primary purpose would be to obtain a benchmark
rating. This could allow Polish private companies to tap intemational bond markets for investment
financing purposes, thus overcoming a critical shortage of capital that presently holds back much needed
refurbishing of infiastructure and productive capacity.

V. Macroconomic Oudook and Creditworthiness
44. Growth in the Rest of the Decade. Poland needs to sustain or even increase the growth rate of 1993,
in order to be able to address the demands of the society and to make a credible quest for integration in
the European Union by the turn of this century. Tlis necessitates the continued upgrade of the country's
productive infrastructure, which in turn tequires that the current ratios of investment to GDP should be
increased. For these investnent needs to be met, the downward trend in domestic savings needs to be
reversed, or at least halted. Our projections indicate that increased private sector investnent, facilitated
by continued improvements in the overaml legal and regulatory framework, as well as general economic
stability, could be financed without compromising exernal balances. The public sector would also play
an important role in the projected turnaround in savings and in the increase in overall investment. Public
sector savings would become positive and sustained, and public investment expenditures would rise to
about 4.5 percent of GDP. At the turn of the century, therefore, Poland would be on a sustainable growth
path, having achieved a better distribution of its resources between investment and consumption than at
present, and having decreased its reliance on external financing sources to levels that could be maintained
in the future.
45. The extent of the necessary turnaround in savings will hinge on the evolution oi extemal capital
flows. With the prospective settlement of external debt issues, the possibility of using arrears as financing
option will be eliminated, while at the same time interest payments will increase. If official sources were
to remain the main source of credit to the country, the possibility for continued strong growth would be
very limited, and would have to rely on a sustained expansion of exports accompanied by slower growth
of consumption. This would probably entail short-run costs associated with the need to reduce dollar
wages to improve Poland's market share abroad.
46. While it is difficult to project the likely extenal financing from private sources in the medium-term,
two crucial assumptions have been made in the base case scenario. First, private sector flows will have
a substantially greater role than in the past for the financing of the current account deficit. Second,
however, the net result of the increase in private flows and in (paid) debt service, following the conclusion
of the debt reduction agreements, will have little overall impact on net resources available to finance the
non-intest current account deficit.
47. Under this scenario, total extenal financing requirements fbr the Polish economy during 1994-2001
would amount to some US$39 billion (for a cumulative non-interest current account (NICA) deficit of
US$6.2 billion, factor payments due of US$28 billion, and an increase in reserves of almost US$5 billion,
Table 9). The share of arrears and debt forgiveness would fill to zero, from 2/3 during the period 1990-
93. Private sources would then be the main source of financing (59 percent in the second half of the
decade, witi a substantial increase in DFI and in private lending flows). Official sources would remain
an important lender to Poland (a total of 38 percent of lending in 1994-2001), with the World Bank
continuing to play a large, albeit declining role (about 13 percent of lending in 1994-2001).

48. Creditworthiness Indicators. Table 10 shows creditworthiness indicators for the years 1994-2001.
As a result of the Paris Club and London Club debt reduction operations, Poland's debt/GDP ratio would
considerably improve, to 41 percent at end-1994, and would continue to decline to about a third of GDP
by the beginning of the new millennium, on account of the assumed growth path and the declining current
account deficits. Debt service as a proportion of exports of goods and services would also decline for the
remainder of this decade, to increase slightly to about 15 percent as the amortization of the Paris Club and
London Club instruments begins.
VI. Proposed Bank Support
Bank Assince to Poand
49. The World Bank has provided considerable support to the Polish reform program over the past four
years, through policy dialogue and lending. As of August, 1994, about US$3.5 billion equivalent were
committed under 19 operations.
50. The Bank's assistance strategy focuses on supporting the implementation of key reforms through
policy advice, lending and cofinancing with e-icial and private creditors. A high priority is given to the
implementation of the existing portfolio of projects, which includes support to critical reform programs
in the enterprise and financial sector and in the privatization area. The policy dialogue is also enhanced
through an ESW program which includes a Country Economic Memorandum, a Poverty Assessment, a
Financial Sector Review and a study of post-privatization performance and financial assistance needs of
enterprises. Technical assistance is also being provit.'d in a number of areas, ranging from public
administration and public expenditure reform, to banking sector reform.
Jl. The Bank has provided, over the past few years, considerable assistance to Poland's attempt to
normalize relations with commercial crolitors, ranging from macroeconomic advice to grants used to
finance the debt negotiations and stmangthen the debt management abilities of the Government. The
operation proposed in this Memorandum is consistent with the Bank's countly assistance strategy for
Poland, last discussed by the Executive Board in May 1993. Under that srategy a DDSR loan was
envisaged as a complement to the Bank's support to Poland's strucural adjustment programs, which, as
outlined below, are proceeding satisfactorily. The operation supports the county's efforts to restore
external creditworthiness by alleviating the uncertainty over fuitre debt servicing, and to provide a more
conducive environment for structural refom and private-sector based growth
The Proposed Support Package
52. The Govenunent of Poland has requested World Bank support for the DDSR operation, the Closing
Date of which is tentatively scheduled for October 27, 1994. World Bank fmancing would reimburse
Poland for a portion of the costs incurred in implementing the DDSR operation. The support requested
is in the form of (i) release of the Set-Asides from three existing adjustment operations; (ii) a stand-alone
debt and debt service reduction loan; and (iii) a partial waiver of the negative pledge clauses in the loan
and guarantee agreements between the World Bank and the Republic of Poland.



- 21 -
ReJease of Set-Asides.
53. The first component of the Bank support would be provided by the release of the Set-Asides that have
been provided for under hee adjustment loans now under execution: the Financial Institutions
Development Loan, the Agriculture Sector Adjusument Loan and the Enterprise and Financial Sector
Adjustment loan, for a total of US$230 million equivalent. This amount represents ess than 25 percent
of the three-year adjustment lending program of US$1 billion equivalent at the time the Board approved
it5. Progress under the dutee loans is satisfactory, although not all the second-tranche conditions for the
three operations have yet been met. The Government is aware of the specific measures that are required
to that effect, and has infonned the World Bank that it is working towards their fulflllment. The release
of the Set-Asides would be effieted through an Implementation Agreement. Any undisbursed portions
of the funds after June 30, 1995 (the Closing Date) would be re-allocated for general imports under the
existing tranches in the corresponding adjustment operations.
Debt and Debt Service Reduction Loan
54. In addition to the release of the Set-Asides, the authorities have requested that US$170 million be
provided in the fonn of a stand-alone loan. The closing date will be June 30, 1995. This amount falls
within the guidelines set by the Board for DDSR operations (up to 15 percent of the three-year lending
progran, which is in the range US$1.8-2.1 billion equivalent). Overall, World Bank support would
amount to US$400 million equivalent.
55. No new conditionality is proposed for this loan, which is intended to be part of the overall Bank's
support for Poland's adjustment program. As discussed in previous sections, the macroeconomic
framework in Poland is currently quite satisfictory. The Bank is fuirthennore engaged in a broad and in-
depth dialogue on strucral policies, involving past and prospective operations, in the areas most relevant
for the development of Poland's medium-tenn growth potential.
56. Disbursement Arrangements. The Set-Asides and the proceeds of the DDSR loan would be
disbursed to reimburse Poland for payments made with respect to the buy-back of Eligible Debt and
associated past-due interest. The Government of Poland has appointed a closing agent for the handling
of the debt buy-back, as well as a collateral agent that will hold the collateral bonds needed for the
finalization of the operation. No disbursements would be made under the DDSR Loan Agreement and
the Implementation Agreement until: (i) the Bank approves the procedures for withrawals in respect of
the buy-back; (ii) the Bank is satisfied that the agreements made by the Republic of Poland pursuant to
the 1994 Financing Plan for the buy-back are in full force and effect; and (iii) the proceeds of the DDSR
loan and the set-asides are disbursed concurrently
57. Effectivaess Conditions. The Implementation Agreement and the DDSR Loan Agreement will
become effective only if (i) the Republic of Poland has confirmed the availability of adequate resources
to implement the 1994 Fmancing Plan; and (ii) the Republic of Poland has entered, pursuant to the 1994
Financing Plan, into agreements with Participating Lenders for the Purchase of Eligible Debt and
associated past-due interest in an amount of approximately US$2.1 billion, and for the exchange of

Set-Aside Provisions for Debt Reduction", April 13, 1993.

Eligible Debt for: (a) Par bonds of an amount equivalent to approximately US$0.9 billion; (b) Discount
Bonds in an amount equivalent to approximately US$3.2 billion; (c) RSTA bonds in an amount equivalent
to approximately US$0.9 million; (d) PDI bonds in an amount equiv4ent to approximately US$2.5 billion;
and (e) Debt Conversion Bonds in an amount equivalent to approximately US$380 million.
58. Prepayment Provisions. The Bank will have the right to require the Republic of Poland to repay,
in advance of maturity, any portion of the Set-Asides or of the DDSR loan already disbursed if the loan
or the set asides are not used for the purposes set forth in the DDSR Loan Agreement or in the
Implementation Agreement.
59. Remedies of the Bank In addition to the above, the Bank may accelerate the maturity of the loan
and the set-aside funds, if it is not probable that the 1994 Financing Plan or its significant part will be
carried out.
Waiver of the Negative Pledge.
60. In addition to release of the Set-aside Funds and the DDSR Loan, the Government has requested a
limited waiver of the negative pledge clauses in the loan and guarantee agreements between the Bank and
the Republic of Poland in order to allow for a pledge of collateral in the amounts required to secure the
principal payments on the par, discount and RSTA bonds to be issued by the Republic of Poland. The
amounts required to purchase the collateral are currently estimated at $598 million. In order to allow
for a possible increase in the acquisition costs of the collateral instruments prior to the October 27th (the
Exchange Date) the Government has requeswed that the waiver be granted for U$620 million. The pledge
of collateral would be for the 30 year life of the par, discount and RSTA bonds.
6 1. The Bank has received a letter f*om the Government formally requesting the waiver of the negative
pledge clause (Annex II). In this letter, the Government has reaffirmed its obligation to continue to
make timely payments on its loans from the Bank and has affirmed that such loans would not be subject
to rescheduling. The Govermment has also indicated its understanding that the consent by the World
Bank to a waiver of the negative pledge clause would be limited to the tansactions included in the
agreements entered into pursuant to the 1994 Financing Plan and would be without prejudice to the Bank's
position on the negative pledge clause under its loan and guarantee agreenments in general. The
Government has also indicated that it is simultaneously requesting similar waivers of negative pledge
clauses in agreements with other creditors, including the EBRD and the EIB.
Burden Sharing
62. On the basis of the above proposal, the burden sharing in the financing ofthe DDSR operation (IBRD
and IMF: 19 percent each; Republic of Poland: 62 percent) would be comparable to that of other similar
operations.
Benefint and Risks
63. The benefits of the proposed operation have been discussed in the previous sections. With the
normalization of relations with creditors, Poland can look forward to a more certain external environment



- 23 -
on which to base its economic and social growth, as well as renewed access to capital markets. Investors'
interest could be stimulated both by the removal of uncertainty and by the setting up of a program of debt-
equity swap. Greater predictability in the path of debt service will also facilitate the process of fiscal
consolidation.
64. Some risks should be bome in mind. The main concem is presented by the greater inflexibility of
the resulting debt structure after the execution of the DDSR, which could endanger repayments to the
Bank were economic conditions to deteriorate in the future. This risk would be compounded by slippage
on the economic policy front. This cannot be altogether excluded, particularly over a long term horizon.
As previously discussed, however, present policies in Poland are broadly consistent with maintenance of
stable macroeconomic conditions. Success by the Govemment in pursuing its own reform agenda will
be a key detenninant of a translation of the good economic performance of the past two years into
sustained medium-term growth.
VIOL Recommendations
65. I am satisfied that the proposed loan would comply with the Articles of Agreement of the Bank and
would be consistent with the approved guidelines for Bank support of DDSR programs. I therefore
recommend that the Executive Directors approve:
(i)   the Debt and Debt Service Reduction Loan on the terms and conditions proposed;
(ii)  the release of the Set-Asides on the terms and conditions as described in the hnplementation
Agreement; and
(iii)  the request for a limited waiver of the negative pledge clause in loan and guaantee agreements
between the Bank and the Republic of Poland, as described in paragaph 57.

Annex I - The 1991 Paris Club Agreement
66. On April 1991 the Paris Club agreed to reduce Polish outstanding official debt to its official creditors
by 50 percent on a net present value basis6. Following the approval of an EFF by the IMF and the
signature of bilateral agreements with its individual creditors, a plan for debt and debt service reduction
(DDSR) was scheduled to take place in two phases. First, a 30% reduction in net present value was
achieved through a menu option approach that included interest and principal reduction. Second, using
the same menu option menu approach as in the first stage, the Paris Club agreed to grant an additional
20 percent reduction by April 1994 upon successful completion the ongoing IMF program and provided
that Poland would seek comparable treatment from all other foreign creditors, particularly from other
official creditors not taking part in the April 1991 Paris Club agreement, and from commercial bank
creditors.

67. Structure of the agreement. The first stage (April 199-April 1994) gave Poland a 30 percent
reduction on a net present value basis through a combination of (i) an 80 percent reduction of the newly
scheduled interest payments to be made over the three following years, (ii) no payment of amortization
over the same period of time, and (iii) additional reduction provided by selection of one of three options
of the debt reduction menu. The second stage (April 1994) provided the additional 20 percent on a net
6    Representatives of the Governments of Austria, Belgium, Brazil, Cmada, Demnark, Finland, France,
Germany, Italy, Japan, the Netherlands, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland, the United Kingdom, and The United
States, referred to as "Participant Creditors Countries", met in Paris on April 19, 20, and 21 1991 with
the representatives of the Polish Government.  Janusz Sawicki, Vice-Minister of Finance and
Plenipotentiary Minister for Debt Matters headed the Polish delegation. Observers from the IBRD, IMF,
EBRD, and UNCTAD also attended the meeting.

present value basis, using the same options menu as in the first stage. Participating creditors countries
agreed to use the same set of options in both stages, and for the purposes of the Agreed Minutes, they
tentatively choose among the three options. Subsequent bilateral agreements between each individuat
countries and Poland determined the final outcome of the selected options.
68. Menu of options: The agreed minutes of the agreement set the parameters for the calculation of the
options such as all three options were equivalent on a net resent value basis. The main provisions of the
three options were the following:
a.    Principal Reduction: cancellation of a percentage of principal based on the creditor country's
appropriate market interest rate; and rescheduling or refinancing of the remaining principal with
18 years maturity and 6 years grace at the appropriate market interest rates.
b.    Interest Reduction: rescheduling or refinancing of 100% of principal with 18 years maturity and
4 years grace at a reduced interest rate based on the creditor country's appropriate market
interest rate.
C.    Interest Capitalization: rescheduling or refinancing of 100% of principal with 23 years maturity
and 12 years grace at an interest rate based on the creditor country's appropriate market interest
rate (within the principal repayment period, amortization payments increase over time according
to a specific agreed-upon schedule); and capitalization of a portion (35% in the first stage, 50%
in the second stage) of the resulting interest falling due between the beginning of the second
stage and the end of the grace period, with no interest being charged on the amounts being
capitalized.
d.    Additional voluntary bilateral DDSR. The agreement included additional provisions so that
participating creditor countries, on a voluntary basis, could sell or exchange up to 10% (or up
to US$20 million, whichever is higher) of the pre-DDSR nominal value of their debt. The
agreement stated that this anrangements would be in the form of debt-equity swaps, debt for
nature swaps, or other types of "debt-for-goods swaps." Individual creditor countries could also
offer additional debt relief on a voluntary and bilateral basis.

Annex m - Request for Limited Waiver of the Negative Pledge Clause
September 23, 1994
lnternational Bank for
Reconstruction and Development (the "Bank")
1818 H Street, N.W.
Washington D.C. 20433
United States of America
I refer to the 1994 Financing Proposals for the Republic of Poland dated May 23, 1994 (the "Financing
Proposals"), that were previously distributed to the commercial bank creditors of Poland, a copy of which
is enclosed herewith.
Background The Financing Proposals represent a comprehensive reduction and restructuring of the
external debt of the Republic of Poland ("Poland") owed to its commercial creditors under the 1988
Restructuring Agreement (the "1988 RA") and the 1983 and 1984 Revolving Short Term Trade Related
Facilities Agreements (the 'RSTAs"), together with the reduction and restructuring of all interest arrears
associated therewith.
Creditor banks under the 1988 RA committing to the 1994 Financing Proposals may elect from the
following four options:
- a Buyback option pursuant to which eligible principal, and the accrued contacual interest associated
therewith, will be repurchased by Poland at a cash price equal to 41% of the aggregate amount
(expressed in US Dollars) of such principal and interest.
- a Discount Bond option pursuant to which eligible principal will be exchanged for bonds ("Discount
Bonds") issued by Poland in an aggregate principal amount equal to 55% of the aggregate amount of
such eligible principal. Principal of the Discount Bonds will be repaid in a single instalment 30 years
after issuance, and will be fully collateralized. Discount Bonds will bear interest at LIBOR plus 13/16%.
- a Par Bond option pursuant to which eligible principal will be exchanged for bonds ("Par Bonds")
issued by Poland in an aggregate principal amount equal to the aggregate amount of such eligible
principal. Principal of the Par Bonds will be repaid in a single instalment 30 years after issuance, and
will be fully collateralized. Par Bonds will bear interest at the below market fixed rates described in Part
5 of the Financing Proposals.
- a New Money Bond and Debt Conversion Bond option pursuant to which eligible principal will be
exchanged for bonds ("Debt Conversion Bonds") issued by Poland in an aggregate principal amount
equal to the aggregate amount of such eligible principal. Principal of the Debt Conversion Bonds will
be repaid in 11 equal semiannual installments commencing after a 20 year grace period and ending 25
years after issuance. Debt Conversion Bonds will bear interest at the below market fixed rates described
in Part 6 of the Financing Proposals. Creditors electing this option shall also be required to provide new
money to Poland by subscribing for bonds ("New Money Bonds") issued by Poland in an amount equal
to 35% of the amount of such eligible principal. Principal of the New Money Bonds will be repaid in
II equal semiannual installments commencing after a 10 year gmce period and ending 15 years after
issuance. New Money Bonds will bear interest at LIBOR plus 13/16%.



- 28 -
Eligible interest under the 1988 RA associated with eligible principal exchanged for Discount Bonds, Par
Bonds and Debt Conversion Bonds will be exchanged for bonds ("Past Due Interest Bonds") issued by
Poland in an aggregate principal amount equal to the aggregate amount of such interest. Principal of the
Past Due Interest Bonds will be repaid in 27 semiannual installments as set forth in Part 2 of the
Financing Proposals, commencing after a 7 year grace period and ending 21 years after issuance. Past Due
Interest Bonds will bear interest at the below market fixed rates described in Part 2 of the Financing
Proposals.
Creditor banks under the RSTAs committing to the 1994 Financing Proposals may select from the
following two options:
- a Buyback option pursuant to which eligible principal, and the accrued contractual interestt associated
therewith, will be repurchased by Poland at a cash price equal to 38% of the aggregate amount
(expressed in US Dollars) of such principal and interest.
- an RSTA Bond option pursuant to which eligible principal, and the accrued contractual interest
associated therewith, will be exchanged for bonds ("RSTA Bonds") issued by Poland in an aggregate
principal amount equal to the aggregate amount of such eligible principal and interest. Principal of the
RSTA Bonds will be repaid in a single inctalment 30 years after issuance, and will be fully
collateralized. RSTA Bonds will bear interest at the below market fixed rates described in Part 9 of the
Financing Proposals.
Payment in full of the principal of the Discount Bonds, Par Bonds and the RSTA Bonds on maturity
in 30 years will be secured by a first priority security interest created by Poland over zero coupon US
Treasury bonds or over such other US Treasury obligations as are acceptable to the creditors, which bonds
will mature on or before the maturity dates and which bonds will have an aggregate face value equal to
the aggregate principal amount of such bonds (the "Collateral"). The Collateral will be held by The
Federal Reserve Bank of New York as collateral agent for the benefit of the holders of the Discount
Bonds, Par Bonds and RSTA Bonds. The Past Due Interest Bonds, Debt Conversion Bonds and New
Money Bonds will not be collateralized. The Financing Proposals do not include any provisions for
interest collateral.
The date upon which the buybacks and bond exchanges will occur is now scheduled for October 27,
1994 (the "Exchange Date"). With respect to amounts of eligible principal and interest under the 1988 RA
and the RSTAs that have now been fully reconciled as between the recorus of Poland and the various
holders as of the Exchange Date, the full amount of the various bonds and buyback cash exchangeable
therefor will be placed in escrow with the Bank of England for a period of adjudication and final
reconciliation. The determination of the amounts ultimately subjected to such escrow arrangements will
not affect the amount of Collateral initially placed with the collateral agent on the Exchange Date.
With respect to the 1988 RA, banks holding 99.5 of eligible principal have now committed to the
Financing Proposals, of which approximately 24.4% have committed to the Buyback option, 61.02% have
committed to the Discount Bond option, 10.36% have committed to the Par Bond option, and 4.41% have
committed to the New Money Bond and Debt Conversion Bond option. With respect to the RSTAs, banks
holding 100% of eligible principal have now committed to the Financing Proposals, of which
approximately 26.60% have committed to the Buyback option, and 73.40% have committed to the RSTA
Bond option. Poland has publicly affirmed that caps on certain options and related fillback elections set
forth in the Financing Proposals will not be required to be imposed and all creditors will receive their first



- 29 -
choices among the options.
It is estimated that outstanding principal and interest under the RA and the RSTAs on the Exchange
Date will be approximately as follows: 1988 RA principal, USS 8.7 billion; RSTA6 principal, us$ 1.1
billion; and past due interest, US$ 4.2 billion. It is calculated by Poland that after giving effect to all
creditor elections under the Financing Proposals on the Exchange Date, the resulting total debt reduction
for Poland will be on the order of US$ 6.5 billion or 49.2% on a net present value basis, which is fully
comparble with the 50%/o reduction earlier accorded Poland by the Paris Club of official creditors.
Based upon the allocations of Eligible Debt under both the 1988 RA and the RSTAs among the various
options described above, it is now estimated that the "up front" fnancing required to implement the
buyback and bond exchange tansactions contemplated by the Financing Proposals will be approximately
US$ 1.9 billion, corresponding to us$ 1.3 billion for the Buyback options to purchase eligible principal
and interest and approximately USS 600-620 million to purchase the Collateral. In addition, US$ 160
million for "catch up" interest payments to creditors under the 1988 RA and the RSTA will be made on
the Exchange Date.
Waiver Request. In order to pernit Poland to implement the Financing Proposals and in particular to
grant security interests over the Collateral, Poland requests that the Bank, with reference to the negative
pledge clauses contained in its loan and guarantee agreements with Poland and its agencies and other
public sector entities, consent to the pledge by Poland of the Colleal, acquired at a net cost not to
exceed US$620 million, to secure the principal repayments of the Discount Bonds, Par Bonds and RSTA
Bonds. Poland has received all necessary consents from its commercial bank creditors for the
implementation of the Financing Proposals, including for the pledge by Poland of the Collateral. Poland
is simultaneously requesting, and anticipates receiving, waivers of similar negative pledge clauses in debt
agreements and guaantees to which The European Bank for Reconstruction and Development and the
European Investment Bank are parties. Other than the consents and waivers already obtained from the
commercial banks and the consents and waivers referred to in the immediately preceding sentence, to the
best of our knowledge, no consents or waivers from any other creditors are required for the
implementation of the Financing Proposals.
Poland hereby affirms its obligation to continue to make tinely payments on its loans from the Bank
and affirms that such loans will not be subject to rescheduling. In view of the foregoing, and in view of
Poland's established practice in servicing its obligations to the Bank, we trust that the Bank will, pursuant
to the tenns of the negative pledge clauses under its loans and guaantee agreements with Poland and its
agencies and other public sector entities, consent to the pledge of the Collateal as described above, it
being understood that the consent granted by Bank will be limited to the transactions described above and
will be without prejudice to the position of the Bank regarding the negative pledge clause in its loan and
guarantee agreements in general.
Thank you for your prompt attetition to this matter.
Sincerely Yours,
1st
