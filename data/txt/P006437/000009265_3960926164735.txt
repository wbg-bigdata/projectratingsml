MEMORANDUM AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT
OF THE INTERNATIONAL BANK FOR RECONSTRUCTION AND DEVELOPMENT
TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS
ON A PROPOSED LOAN
TO THE CAIXA ECONOMICA FEDERAL
WITH THE GUARANTEE OF THE FEDERATIVE REPUBLIC OF BRAZIL
FOR A WATER PROJECT FOR MUNICIPALITIES AND LOW-INCOME AREAS
1.       The following memorandum and recommendation  on a proposed loan to
the Caixa Economica Federal (National Savings Bank) of Brazil for US$80
million equivalent is submitted for  approval.   The proposed loan would be
repaid over 15 years, including five years grace, at the Bank's standard
variable interest rate. It would help finance a water supply project.
2.       Background.  Although  urban  water  supply  and sewerage services
increased significantly over the last two decades, reaching 82? and S1? of
the population respectively, further major efforts will be needed to extend
coverage to rapidly growing urban areas. The impressive advances in sector
coverage are the result of the implementation of the National Sanitation
Plan (PLANASA).   Since  1977,  US$9.1  billion  has  been invested in this
program; during that time 55 million people received water services and 28
million received waste water  disposal  services.        The CEF, a government
financial institution, is responsible for the execution of PLANASA in
accordance with overall policies set by the Ministry of Housing, Urban
Development and the Environment  (MHU).   Programming, project preparation,
project impJementation, and operation of water systems are carried out for
most municipalities on a concessionary basis by State Water Companies
(SWCs). The major source of funding for PLANASA is the Employee Indemnity
Fund (FGTS), which is financed by an 8? payroll contribution from employees
covered by labor  legislation.    The  States provide counterpart financing
through their individual state water and sanitation funds (FAEs). The SWCs
receive financing for the full investment cost of projects. Interest rates
on loans are positive, ranging from 2Z-10.5Z p.a. plus monetary correction,
and provide a sufficient spread to CEF. The overall policy and investment
programming of PLANASA are satisfactory, but the following matters require
attention: (a) lack of a clear  strategy to expand water and uaste disposal
services to extremely poor urban areas; and (b) the poor financial
condition of SWCs and FAEs.
3.       Water and sewerage service deficits are heavily concentrated among
the low-income urban population: 21 million persons in the poverty group
are not served by water networks and 25 million do not have acceptable
waste water facilities.   The  Government  has  begun to address this need.
PLANASA has been reoriented to cover better the needs of the urban poor and
to invest in sewerage. In addition, the Government has recently launched a
water and sanitation program specifically targeted to the low-income urban
population  (PROSANEAR),  which  ?.s  to   be  executed  through  PLANASA's
organizational set-up. PLANASA's success has shown that its basic approach
is correct and should work well also for PROSANEAR.



4.       Under the National  Tariff  Law  (NTL).  the SWCs' revenues should
cover the sum of operating costs, depreciation and debt service. The rain
reason for the poor financial performance of the SWCs in 1985 and 1986 was
the reluctance of the Government to increase tariffs. In 1987, however,
tariffs increased substantially and generated real revenue increases with
respect to December 1986 levels,  averaging  127Z.   To further improve the
financial situation of the SWCs, under the guidance of CEF, the SWCs and
States are now implementing financial recuperation plans, which ptovide for
break even cash flow in 1988 and attainment of the aforementioned NTL
requirements in 1989. These plans require real tariff increases, enhanced
collections, improved operating efficiencies, and--in some cases--debt
rescheduling andlor capital contributions.    CEF has submitted evidence to
the Bank showing that 13 SWCs--including those of Sao Paulo, Rio de
Janeiro, and Minas Gerais--have complied with the 1987 goals of their
respective plans.
5.       Rationale for Bank Involvement.   The Bank's strategy in Brazil is
to support macroeconomic adjustment and economic growth, while helping to
ensure efficient delivery of critical support programs for the poot. The
Bank  has  therefore  helped  finance   social  sector  projects  with  the
objectives of helping to focus priorities on the most critical problems and
improve efficiency in the utilization of scarce resources. The project is
consistent with the Bank's strategy as it will have a major impact on
improve the social welfare of the extremely poor urban population on a
cost-effective basis.   Improvements  in  water  and  sanitation like those
included in the proposed project, have been identified as a major factor in
the drop of 25Z in the infant mortality rate in Brazil during the
seventies. Ten Bank-supported projects have contributed to the impressive
extension of services as well as to the establishment within PLANASA of
sound sector financial and economic policies.
6.       Project Objectives.  The proposed  project  is  a first stage of a
long-term program to extend water, waste water, and solid waste services to
poor areas of urban centers (PROSANEAR) and to expand water and sewerage
systems in cities with municipally operated water utilities. The low-
income  component  would  be   used   to  test  innovative  approaches  and
technologies, including financing, cost recovery, and cross-subsidization
mechanisms for the provision of services to the poor on a low-cost,
affordable basis. The Campinas Project Component will permit the testing
of operational procedures and financial mechanisms within PLANASA to enable
municipal water utilities which have not joined PLANASA to qualify for its
financing. Around 30Z of the Brasilian urban communities--including about
ten cities--have not joined PLANASA, although most of them have urgent
needs for expanding water and waste water installations. Campinas was
selected as the first case from this group of ten cities because of the
sound financial and technical capabilities of its water utility, SANASA.
7.       Project Lescription.  The  project  includes  (a) under the sector
component for low-income areas (522 of project cost): (i) a group of
eligible subprojects for water supply and waste-water disposal; (ii)
complementary    sanitary    installations    (i.e.,    in-house   sanitary
installations, solid waste collection, and storm drainage); and (iii) a
technical assistance program  for  PROSANEAR  to strengthen capabilities to



plan and execute low-income projects, to develop methodologies and new
technologies, and to train  staff.    This  component would benefit 200,000
persons with water services and 700,000 with sewerage; and (b) under the
Campinas component (482 of project cost): installations to improve and
expand the city's water supply system to meet water demands up to the year
2002, and a program for the reduc*ion of unaccounted for water. This
project component will benefit 800,000 persons.
8.       The total cost of  the  project  is  estimated at US$190.7 million
equivalent with a foreign exchange component of US$65 million and would be
carried out over seven years.   The  proposed  Bank loan would cover 50% of
the estimated cost of the low-income component, and 33Z of the Campinas
component. in view of the urgent need to expand the water system of the
city of Campinas which is presently operating 282 overloaded, works have
already begun, and the proposed loan would provide retroactive financing
amounting to US$8.0 million.    Under  the  low-income component, CEF would
enter into financing contracts with the project Beneficiaries. Works would
be executed and systems operated by state water companies or autonomous
municipal entities which comply  with eligibility criteria explained below.
Undir the Campinas component, CEF will enter into financing agreements with
the municipality  and  SANASA.    SANASA  will  be  responsible for project
execution. With regard to the low-income component, the Bank will finance
50% of total compcnent cost and CEF an additional 25%. CEF will make the
Bank  loan  proceeds  and   its   counterpart   funding  available  to  the
Beneficiaries as follows: (a) the Bank loan proceeds, under similar terms
and conditions as those of the Bank loan, plus a spread to cover the
financial intermediation, administrative costs, and the foreign exchange
risk, which the Borrower will bear; and (b) the 25% counterpart financing,
under standard PLANASA lending terms.    The remaining 252 will be provided
by State and local governments  in  the  form of cash, materials, or labor.
With regard to the SANASA component, the Bank will finance 33Z of total
component cost, CEF will finance 172, the municipality of Campinas 30% and
SANASA the remaining 20%.   The  Municipality  loan will be repaid in three
years following project completion with the same interest rate as the Bank
loan. CEF lending and relending terms are similar to those detailed above
for the low-income component. A breakdown of costs and the financing plan
are shown in  Schedule  A.    Amounts  and  methods  of procurement and the
disbursement  schedule  are  shown  in  Schedule  B.    Other  key  project
information are given in Schedules C and D, respectively. A map and t'ie
Staff Appraisal Report No. 7083-BR dated January 11, 1988 are also
attached.
9.       Actions Agreed.  The  Bank  received  assurances on the following:
(a) that SANASA will  increase  its  tariff  levels  so that revenues would
cover operating costs, debt service, dividends, working capital increases,
202 of the investment cost to the Project, and 100% of needed complementary
investment; (b) that SANASA would not contract any long-term indebtedness,
beyond US$5 million needed for working capital, prior to Project completion
without CEF-Bank agreement; and (c) the criteria for the selection of
eligible Beneficiaries and low-income subprojects which would be inter
alia, as follows: (i) compliance by the SWC or municipal entity with the
provisions of the NTL or a financial recovery plan acceptable to the Bank;
(ii) design of the subproject with appropriate low-cost technologies and
within established per capita cost limits; (iii) selection of cities having



- 4 -
populations of more than 50,000 with at least 40? of beneficiaries with
less than one minimum salary; and (iv) ability of the users to pay the
services provided in accordance with the water utility's current rates. In
addition, agreement was reached on the following special conditions: (i)
as a condition of Loan Effectiveness, the signature of a financing
agreement between CEF-SANASA and thc Municipality of Campinas; and (ii) as
a condition of Loan disbursements:    (a) the execution of three on-lending
agreements under the low-income areas component; and (b) the execution of
the respective project financing agreement for each eligible subproJect.
10.      Benefits.  Benefits under the  proposed Project are expected from:
(i) improved efficiency in the delivery of water supply and sanitRtion
services  to  low-income   urban   populations;   and   (ii)  extension  of
waterlsewerage services to an estimated 1.5 million persons. The rates of
return, using existing tariffs as a proxy for minimum economic benefits --
excluding consumer surplus and health and environmental externalities --
are 132 for the low-income Project component and 8? for the Campinas
component.
11.      Risks.    The  project  risks  are  associated with the innovatJve
character of the low-income program and the required coordination at
Federal and local levels.   To  minimize  these risks, the Project provides
for a substantial participation of CEF's highly experienced and qualified
sanitation directorate which would help with the application of a new
approach for the provision of services to very low-income areas. The main
sector risk stems from uncertainty over the outlook for inflation in Brazil
and its effect on tariffs and the financial situation of the SWCs and
municipal water utilities.   Continuation  of high inflation rates, coupled
with the need in some cases for real tariff adjustments, would dictate high
nominal tariff increases, which may be politically difficult to implement.
To reduce this risk, CEF, the States, and the SWCs have adopted the
strategy in their financial recovery plans of making frequent small tariff
increases to avoid the problem associated with large adjustmerts.
12.      Recommendation.   I  am  satisfied  that  the  proposed loan would
comply with the Ai icles of Agreement of the Bank and recommend that the
Executive r,irectors approve the proposed Loan.
