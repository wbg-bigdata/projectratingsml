BODHGHAT HYDROELECTRIC PROJECT
I.  THE ENERGY SECTOR
Energy Resources
1.01   India's commercially exploitable energy resources consist of coal,
oil, gas, hydro potential and uranium, which account for about 46% of the
total primary energy supply. Noncommercial energy, firewood and agricultural
and animal waste account for the rest. Coal is the main domestic source of
primary energy, with potential reserves estimated at about 85 billion tons,
of which 25 billion tons are proven reserves. Most of the coal is of low to
medium quality (3,500 to 5,500 kcal/kg). India's remaining proven and
potential reserves of petroleum are currently estimated at 800 million tons
of oil equivalent, of which 470 million tons is oil and the remainder natural
gas. Domestic production of oil has increased from 0.5 million tons in 1961
to 16.2 million tons in 1982 and currently meets about 44% of the country's
oil requirements. Annual gas production is estimated at about 3.1 million
tons of oil equivalent, of which about 60% is used as fuel or feedstock, and
the balance is flared, mainly because there is no market within reasonable
distance. The economically exploitable hydroelectric potential of India is
about 100,000 MW, of which only about 12,000 MW has been developed. Another
4,700 MW is under construction, and 23,000 MW is under investigation. India
also has sufficient uranium (about 15,000 ton equivalent of uranium oxide
economically exploitable) and thorium reserves to meet the country's demand
for nuclear power in the foreseeable future.
1.02    India's energy policy has been geared to limiting the use of
petroleum only in sectors where it cannot be economically substituted by
other energy resources, particularly coal. Despite the recent development of
the offshore petroleum reserves, the country remains dependent, to a large
extent, on imported oil to meet growing demand for transportation,
fertilizers and petrochemicals, as well as in agriculture where substitution
by electricity continues to be limited by insufficient power generation and
distribution facilities. The cost of oil imports in 1981/82 was US$6
billion, representing about 70% of India's estimated merchandise export
earnings. Well identified domestic energy resserves of coal and
hydroelectricity are large enough to supply most of India's future commercial
energy requirements for industry and power generation. However, proven oil
and gas reserves are not sufficient to meet the demand for oil in sectors
where substitution by other fuels is not economically viable.
1.03    Renewable energy resources accounted for about 59% of the total
supply of primary energy in 1975/76, but since then its share has been



-2-
declining. Wood, charcoal, dung and vegetable waste accounted for an
estimated 92% of this supply. The rest was in the form of hydroelectric
pDwer.  It is expected that renewable energy (especially traditional fuels)
will continue to play an important, though decreasing, role in the supply of
energy in rural areas in the coming decades.
Energy Prospects
1.04    Studies prepared in 1979 by a Working Group on Energy Policy
appointed by GOI indicate that the availability of commercial energy may
become a serious constraint to India's economic development and recommended a
systematic program for energy conservation and demand management. The main
policy measures recommended are: (i) improvement in the efficiency of energy
utiiization; (ii) introduction of fuel-efficient technologies; (iii)
reduction of the demand for transportation through improved planning of
production and consumption locations; (iv) reduction of the energy intensity
of industries; and (v) inter-fuel substitution from commercial energy
resources to noncommercial and renewable energy resources. According to the
studies, such measures, supplemented by appropriate pricing policies are
expected to restrain commercial energy consumption without impeding economic
growth.
Energy Pricing Policies
1.05    India has consistently followed a policy of maintaining composite
retail prices of oil products at international levels. All products except
kerosene and naptha are priced at or above border prices. Although there is
a cross-subsidy from gasoline to kerosene, based on social and environmental
considerations, the weighted average prices for all products are higher than
import prices. Coal prices are generally below the economic cost of supply
to the country. Although most of the Indian coal is non-tradeable due to its
low quality, there are substantial amounts of steam and coking coal.
Adjusting for quality, quantity and duration of contracts, the estimated
economic cost for tradeable Indian steam coal would be, at the pithead,
between US$29 to US$37 per ton, compared to current price which ranges
between US$17 to US$21 per ton. The situation is similar for coking coal
whose pithead estimated trading f.o.b. price is between US$30 and US$54,
while the domestic price is between US$18 and US$23. For the non-tradeable
coal there are indications that it is priced below the long-run marginal cost
(IRMC) given the financial losses incurred by the producers and the
relatively low levels of resources mobilized by the industry. There is no
uniform pricing system for gas in India. Currently, its price is fixed on
the basis of form of production (associated or free) and on the type of
supply contract. There are no studies on its economic cost. Although there
are variations among SEBs in the price of electricity, the average tariff is
below the estimated LRMC. In 10 out of 15 SEBs, average industrial tariffs
approach LRMC whilst for domestic consumers LRMC is about three times the
average tariff, and for agricultural consumers it is about four times the



-3-
average tariff. The weighted average LRMC for all consumers is nearly twice
the average revenue. GOI is aware of this disrepancy and has made explicit
its policy for rationalizing energy prices. Coal prices were increased by
30% in February 1982, 16.5% in May 1982, and 20% in November 1983. There
also has been a considerable improvement in the power sector prices. In the
21 month period between March 1981 and December 1982, electricity prices
increased by about 28% compared to a 6.3% increase in the general wholesale
price index in the same period.
The Power Subsector
1.06    In recognition of the need to develop indigenous energy resources,
coal based generation and hydroelectricity have been receiving top priority
in Central and State Government policy planning. The power sector now
receives the largest share of India's public investment resources (20% of the
Sixth Five-Year Plan outlay). In spite of this emphasis, demand for power
continues to exceed supply. In keeping with the global energy policy, GOI
has also indicated the need to increase the hydropower capacity to achieve a
more efficient operation of power system, which presently is predominantly
thermal (coal based), and to make better use of the existing thermal capacity
through upgrading and improved operation and maintenance.
Power Supply and Demand
1.07    In the 1950s and 1960s, installed capacity and power generation
managed to keep pace with the nation's demand for power, both growing at an
average annual rate of about 11%. Since 1970, however, the situation has
deteriorated. Delays in the commissioning of new power plants, operating and
maintenance problems, mostly due to lower than expected coal quality, and
insufficient investment under severe budget constraints have led to a
critical shortage of power. Between 1970-1975, power generation increased at
an average annual rate of about 5%. The situation improved considerably
between 1975-1980, with growth in both generation and capacity averaging
7%-9% annually. This was largely due successively to good monsoons in
1975/76 and 1976/77, improved coal supply, and a concerted effort to improve
project implementation, thermal capacity utilization and overall power system
management. Since 1979/80 power generation has been increasing at a higher
rate than installed capacity. Data for 1980/81 and 1982/82 indicate an
average annual increase for these two years of about 8.0% for power
generation and 6.5% for installed capacity, indicating better utilization of
existing resources. Nevertheless, power shortages have persisted in many
parts of the country.
1.08    As of March 1983, India's total installed generating capacity,
including non-utility plant, was about 38,100 MW. Of this, about 63% was
conventional thermal, 35% hydro, and 2% nuclear. Annex 1 shows the relevant
figures for the power sector in India between 1951 and 1983. Industrial
consumptions accounts for about 60% of all electricity sold in the country,



-4-
agriculture (mainly irrigation) for about 18%, domestic use for about 12%,
and other consumers for aboit 10%. As a result of accelerated agricultural
development, there has been a marked growth of power consumption in the rural
areas where more than 80% of India's population lives. The number of
electrified villages, for example, grew from approximately 3,000 in 1950/51
to an estimated 300,000, or about 52% of all villages in India by the end of
1982. Projections made by India's Central Electricity Authority (CEA) for
its National Power Plan (NPP) indicate that over the thirteen-year period
1981/82-1994/95, utility generating capacity should grow at an average annual
rate of about 9.5%, to a total of about 106,000 MW. Of this, about 59,000 MW
(56%) would be thermal, 44,000 MW (41%) hydro and 3,500 MW (3%) nuclear.
Annex 2 shows the forecasted capacity and energy requirements for India up to
year 2000 as estimated by CEA, for the NPP.
Bank Group Operations in the Power Sector
1.09    Since 1954, the Bank Group has made 15 loans to India for power
projects amounting to US$1,389.6 million, and 16 IDA credits totalling
US$2,266 million. Of these, US$2,465.4 million was for generating plant;
US$23 million for construction equipment for the Beas hydro-electric project;
US$630.7 million for the provision of high-voltage transmission; and US$536.5
million for the support of rural electrification schemes. Sixteen projects
have been completed: ten for generating plant, the Beas Project, four for
power transmission, and the First Rural Electrification Project. The First
Singrauli (Credit 685-IN of April 1977), Third Trombay (Loan 1549-IN of June
1978), and Second Rural Electrification (Credit 911-IN of June 1979) Projects
are scheduled to be completed this year. The First Korba (Credit 793-IN of
May 1978) and First Ramagundam (Credit 874-IN and Loan 1648-IN of February
1979) Thermal Power Projects are in an advanced stage of implementation. The
loan for the Third Rural Electrification Project (Loan 2165-IN) was approved
in June 1982. The loan for the Central Power Transmission Project (Loan
2283-IN), and the loan and credit for the Upper Indravati Hydro Project (Loan
2278-IN and Credit 1356-IN), were approved in May 1983.  The Singrauli,
Korba, and Second and Third Rural Electrification projects are on schedule.
The first four units of the Singrauli project and the first two units of the
Korba project were commissioned on schedule.  The Farakka and Ramagundam
projects are proceeding satisfactorily, the first unit at Ramagundam having
been commissioned four months ahead of schedule.  The Third Trombay Project
(Unit 5) is expected to be commissioned early in 1984, about a year behind
schedule.
1.10    A project performance audit was conducted in 1980 for the Second
Power Transmission Project (Credit 242-IN). The project was considered to
have been successful in assisting the nine beneficiary State Electricity
Boards (SEBs) in extending their transmission systems to meet their growing
power requirements. Utilization of generating capacity in these SEBs
exceeded the appraisal forecast. Rehabilitation of the finances of SEBs,
which commenced under this project, is continuing under subsequent projects.



-5-
The audit highlighted the difficulties of adequately supervising this
project, which consisted of many widely scattered subprojects, and of
effecting institutional improvements in the absence of a close working
relationship between the Bank Group and the beneficiary SEBs. With the
assumption of increased responsibility by CEA in the power sector, a more
effective relationship with SEBs is envisaged.
Sector Institutions
1.11    Under the Indian Constitution, the responsibility for supplying power
is shared by the Central and State Governments, and full agreement between
the two is required for the implementation of most actions. The principal
agencies in the sector are: the State Electricity Boards (SEBs), the Regional
Electricity Boards (REBs), the Central Electricity Authority (CEA), the
National Thermal Power Corporation (NTPC), the National Hydro-Electric Power
Corporation (NHPC), and the Rural Electrification Corporation (REC).
1.12    SEBs were constituted by the State Governments under the provisions
of the Electricity (Supply) Act of 1948 to promote the efficient and
coordinated development of generation, transmission and distributiorn of
electricity, and to control and regulate private licensees and utilities
within the states. The States effectively own or control over 90% of
electricity supply facilities. Although SEBs are corporate entities and
enjoy some autonomy in the management of their day-to-day operations, they
are under the control of State Governments in matters covering capital
investment, tariffs, borrowings, pay scales and personnel policies.
1.13    With the physical interconnection of the States' systems forming
regional systems, there has been an increased need for interstate
coordination.  In response to improved operation and planning, REBs have been
set up for each of the Northern, Southern, Eastern, Western and North-Eastern
Regions. The general function of an REB is to coordinate the operation of
the power system to the maximum benefit of the Region as a whole, to
coordinate overhaul and maintenance programs, to determine generation
schedules and power available for transfer between States, and to determine
tariffs for the transfer of power within the Region.
1.14    CEA was constituted in 1950 with responsibility for formulating
national power policies and coordinating the activities of the various
agencies involved in electricity supply. Its powers were extended by
amendments to the Electricity (Supply) Act of 1948 in 1976.  It is now also
responsible for the formulation and coordination of plans for power
development, optimization of investments in the power sector for the whole
country, development of intercDnnected system, operation, training of
personnel, and research and development. CEA accumulates data on economic,
financial and accounting aspects of the power industry, both at the Center
and State levels, with particular reference to the operations of SEBs, and
advises them on financial matters. In addition, CEA plays the role of



-6-
consultant to SEBs for the engineering of electromechanical elements of the
systems. Working in coordination with CEA, the Central Water Commission
(CWC), under the Ministry of Irrigation, is responsible for the preparation
and approval of all civil engineering aspects of the hydroelectric projects
and serveE as the consultant to SEB's in this regard.
1.15    Economic and technical considerations indicated the need to construct
and operate major generationt and transmission facilities, whose size exceeds
SEB's needs and capabilities. With this purpose, in 1975 GOI incorporated
NTPC and NHPC, whose main purpose is to construct, own and operate large
power stations, as well as high-voltage power transmission lines and
associated substations. NTPC has under construction and partly in operation
six large thermal power stations, while NHPC is building three hydro
stations. Although the Central Government is becoming increasingly important
in the sector, the SEBs will continue to play a major role, particularly in
hydro-electric projects. The States own most hydro sites and are unlikely to
turn over these sources of comparatively inexpensive energy to the Center.
NHPC can develop hydro sites only when the water rights are clear and the
State has surrendered its claim on them.
1.16    The REC was constituted in 1969 and registered under the Companies
Act of 1956 as a limited company wholly owned by GOI. Its primary objective
is to finance rural electrification schemes prepared by SEBs throughout
India, functioning as a financial intermediary with technical expertise, and
ensuring the efficient onlending of funds drawn primarily from GOI. REC
coordinates its lending operations with the activities of other agencies
which provide financing for rural development. Although the amount of REC
financial support is small in relation to total SEB operations, REC today
finances more than half of total rural electrification expenditures.
Bank Group Strategy in the Power Sector
1.17    The Bank Group's strategy in the Indian power sector has been to
cooperate with GOI in finding solutions to the many difficult and politically
sensitive problems confronting the Indian electricity supply industry. The
Bank's main objectives in the sector are:
(a) to eliminate power shortages by the installation of generation
and transmission capacity, and the promotion of measures to
improve the operation and maintenance of existing plant;
(b) to introduce long-range system planning on a nationwide
basis so as to assure implementation of a least-cost power
deveelopment program;
(c) to promote improvements in sector organization and training;
and



-7-
(d) to strengthen the finances of the institutions in the sector,
particularly the State Electricity Boards.
1.18    Despite many difficulties, improvements achieved so far have been
encouraging. With the establishment of Regional Electricity Boards (REBsW
the National Thermal Power Corporation (NTPC) and the National Hydro Power
Corporation (NHPC), important steps towards an improved organizational
structure of the power sector have been made. CEA was reorganised and its
powers enlarged; amendments in the financial provisions of the Electricity
(Supply) Act 1948 clarified the requirements to be followed in tariff
setting, the financial performance of SEBs has improved; the majority of SEBs
have completed tariff studies based on marginal cost pricing principles; CEA
has prepared a long-term National Power Plan; and the increased investment in
the sector will help eliminate the power deficits.
1.19    Because of the rapid expansion of the power industry, all aspects of
the sector needed to be reviewed and solutions found for its various
problems. GOI established in 1978 the Committee on Power, which submitted
its conclusions to GOI in September 1980. They refer to all major aspects of
the power sector including planning, project formulation and implementation;
operation and maintenance; organization and management; finance, and tariffs;
rural electrification; and research and development. The recommendations of
the Committee on Power, most of which are satisfactory in light of the Bank
Group's strategy, form a basis for improvement of all those aspects of the
power sector.
1.20    In accordance with undertakings agreed during negotiations for the
Second Korba Thermal Power Project, GOI furnished, in May 1982, a program for
the implementation of five categories of power sector improvements which the
Bank Group considered areas of high priority. Satisfactory progress has been
made in these five areas for which some of the more recent activities and
achievements are as follows:
(a) Performance of Thermal Power Plants
The Department of Power in GOI has established teams of
specialists, including representatives from CEA, SEBs and
manufacturers, to visit all thermal power plants with 100/120
MW and 200/210 MW generating units in the country to diagnose
technical and operational problems, propose solutions and
assign responsibilities for their implementation. Repeat
visits are planned to assess progress.
(b) Coordination of Power Development and Growth in Other Sectors
The Bank Group received the draft National Power Plan for
power development in September 1982. This plan provides fore-
casts of power demand, and projects the generating capacity and



-8-
equipment that will be required to meet this demand. It will
provide the basis both for five-year plans and annual investment
programs.
(c) Intensification of Hydro-Electric Power Development
GOI is progressing with plans for a number of hydro projects,
some of which will be proposed for Bank Group financing and
others for bilateral assistance. Several projects - among them
Vishnu Prayag (UP), Lohari Nag (UP), Naphtha Zhakri (HP),
Puyan Kutti (Kerala), and Lower Periyar (Kerala) - have reached
advanced stages of project preparation. The Upper Indravati
project, the first hydro power project in India to be proposed
for Bank Group financing, was approved on May 10, 1983. In
addition, GOI is planning to begin investigations on what
would be one of the largest bydro power projects in the world -
the 15,000 MW Dihand project-in north eastern India where a
number of other projects are also under consideration.
(d) Strengthening the role of the Central Sector in Power Generation
and interstate High Voltage Transmission
(i) GOI, through NTPC, has under construction and partly
in operation about 10,000 MW of power generating
capacity. In addition to the four Bank Group-financed
thermal stations at Singrauli, Korba, Ramagudam and
Farakka (which, except for Farakka, are now in their
second phases of construction), a 1000 MW plant at
Rihand (UP) and a 1260 MW plant at Vindhyachal (MP) are
also being undertaken by NTPC. Agreements have been
signed with the UK and USSR, respectively, for the
financing of these plants. A 840 MW plant near Delhi
is also under consideration by NTPC.
(ii) The Central Power Transmission project will reinforce
the Centrally owned power transmission grid, and provide
the first stage of integration of the Northern, Western
and Southern regional grids, taking into account
compatability for eventual energy pooling.
(e) Establishment of Financial Objectives and Policies for their
Implementation; Principles for Evolving Rational Tariff Policies;
and Improvements in Management Information and Accounting Systems
for State Electricity Boards.
(i) Legislation for amendment of the financial provisions of
the Electricity (Supply) Act, 1948 was enacted by GOI
in August 1983. These amendments will remove some of the



-9-
anomalies in the Act which have resulted in the SEBs all
following different and inconsistent accounting practices,
thereby rendering their financial performance impossible
to measure or compare.
(ii) Management consultants have completed a review of present
accounting practices in two of the SEBs (Punjab and
Gujarat); they are now engaged in developing a uniform
system of commercial accounting for adoption by all SEBs.
Their review was followed by preparation of a draft report
and accounting manual completed in January 1984 which will
form the basis of the new accounting system scheduled for
introduction in 1985. CEA is charged with monitoring the
development of the new accounting system and the financial
performance of the SEBs.
(iii) With the Third Rural Electrification Project, approved
in June 1982, new financial performance criteria for
the SEBs were introduced. These were designed to
provide for reasonable contributions by the SEBs to
power investment, and to reduce gradually State
Government subsidies for rural electrification losses.
Power Supply and Demand in the Western Region
1.21    The Western Region, in which the project would be located, comprises
the states of Gujarat, Madhya Pradesh, and Maharashtra and the Union
Territories of Goa, Daman and Diu, and Dadra and Nagar Haveli. The Region
covers about 29% of the country's area and has an estimated population of 149
million. Industrial electricity consumption represents about 62% of the
region's total, compared with 57% nationwide, agricultural uses account for
13% (against 18% for India), and the rest (25%) is consumed by residential
and commercial users. Overall electricity sales have been increased between
1975 and 1983 at an average annual rate of about 8% p.a. Industrial
consumption increased at an annual rate of 6.2%, agricultural at 14% and
domestic at 12%. Maharashtra consumes about 54% of the total production,
followed by Gujarat (28%) and Madhya Pradesh (18%) (Annex 4).
1.22    As of March 1983, the total installed utility capacity in the Region
was about 10,045 MW, consisting of 78% thermal, 18% hydro and 4% nuclear
(Annex 5). This capacity, with the exception of 210 MW owned and operated by
NTPC and 420 MW owned and operated by Department of Atomic Energy, is owned
by SEBs. There are in addition,some 660 MW of captive industrial generating
plants (above 600 kW per set). About 51% of total regional capacity is
located in Maharashtra, 28% in Gujarat and 21% in Madhya Pradesh. Although
installed capacity increased at about 10.4% p.a. during 1975-83, available
capacity grew at about 8.3% p.a., indicating a significant deterioration in
plant availability (only about 62% of installed capacity in 1982/83). Causes
of low availability range from lower than expected quality of coal and



-10-
equipment to overloading of plants due to capacity shortages. Although
interconnection of the Region's states is established, operations are not yet
fully integrated due to operational constraints in Madhya Pradesh (Annex 6).
The pooling and dispatching arrangements are coordinated through REB and are
expected to substantially improve with a new load dispatch facility based on
a real time computer currently under installation.
1.23    Annex 7 shows the past and projected power supply situation for the
Region and the expected capacity additions during 1984-92. The peak and
energy requirements shown are based on the forecast prepared for the National
Power Plan, adjusted on the basis of the actual demand observed in 1982/83 in
the Western Regiorn. Currently the power shortage in the region is critical
resulting in severe supply restriction in all three States, especially in
Maharashtra and Madhya Pradesh. Regulatory measures for power cuts and
restrictions and load shedding were imposed throughout the year which
affected the industrial and agricultural consumers as well as domestic users
above a minimum level. Due to the existing shortage of peaking capacity, the
constrained peak demand has grown at an average rate of only 7.4% p.a.
during the last five years. Demand for peak capacity is expected to grow
at about 8.5% p.a. until 1992. The present estimated capacity shortage of
about 1300 MW or 17% of the potential demand would be eliminated, according
to current plans, around 1990. New addition to capacity during 1980s will be
priedominantly thermal, but in 1988/89-1992/93 additional hydel capacity of
2,386 MW is expected to be commissioned, including 500 MW from the propoised
Bodhghat Project.
Supply and Demand of Electricity in Madhya Pradesh
1.24    As of March 1983, the total installed capacity of MPEB, the
beneficiary of the project, was about 1,841 MW, consisting of 90% thermal
(mostly coal fired) and 10% hydro. During the last 10 years, both the peak
load and the installed capacity grew under restricted supply conditions at
an annual rate of 9.5% (Annex 8). Electricity sales have grown at 8.1% p.a.
during 1978/79-1982/83 reaching 5,878 GWh in 1982/83 (Annex 9). Due to
capacity shortages, imports were always needed to partially cover the
deficits. It is estimated that the unconstrained estimated peak load would
reach about 4,800 MW in 1991/92 at a rate of growth of about 12.5% p.a. and
that the current capacity deficit of about 17% (320 MW) in 1983 will increase
to some 19% (900 MW) in 1991/92. Energy requirements are also expected to
increase at a rate of 12.5% p.a. between now and 1991/92, but the existing
deficit in energy availability will, however, decrease from about 23% to
about 13% in the same period. Of the total electricity consumption in Ml' in
1982/83, 94% was for productive uses (commerce, industry, agriculture,
traction) leaving the balance to domestic users, whose consumption is one of
the lowest in India. In the same year, industry consumed 71.4% of the
electricity, followed by irrigation (9.4%), domestic uses (7.5%) and railways
and waterworks (5.7%). While the share of industrial consumption, the single
largest consumer, remained relatively unchanged during 1975-83, agricultural
consumption grew at 16.6%, from 5.5% of the total in 1975 to 9.4% in 1983.
Annex 10 shows the consumption by consumer categories for 1974-83.

II.   THE BORROWER, THE IMPLEMENTING AGENCY AND THE BENEFICIARY
A. The Borrower
Lending Arrangements
2.01    GOI would be the borrower and recipient of the Loan and Credit, and
would channel the proceeds to the Government of Madhya Pradesh (GOMP) in
accordance with its standard arrangements for development assistance to the
States. GOMP, in turn, will make available these funds to MPEB as part of
its lending contribution to the latter's investment program. MPEB would
implement the Project and, upon completion, it would carry out its operation
and maintenance. It was agreed that Madhya Pradesh will onlend to the Board
the proceeds of the Bank Group funds for a term of 25 years, including a
period of grace of 5 years, at an interest rate of not less than 7.5% per
annum.  GOI and GOMP also confirmed that the remainder of the funds provided
for the Project would also be made available to MPEB on a loan basis under
the same terms. These terms are acceptable considering that GOMP's
contribution to the project, including IDA and IBRD funds, are made available
to SEB in its entirety as a loan. The onlending rate is positive in real
terms and will be adjusted annually by GOMP to keep it so.
B. The Implementing Agency and The Beneficiary
Madhya Pradesh State Electricity Board (MPEB)
Organization and Management
2.02    MPEB was constituted in 1950 under the Electricity (Supply) Act of
1948, and is responsible for generation, transmission and distribution of
electricity throughout the State.  It constructs and operates thermal and
hydroelectric generating stations, and transmission and distribution networks
to supply ultimate consumers and licencees with electric power. However,
MPEB is not fully autonomous in executing these responsibilities, since it is
controlled, according to statutory power, by the State Government, especially
in matters of staffing, borrowing and tariff-setting. MPEB-s capital
investment program is determined within the overall State and national
planning framework.
2.03    MPEB is a corporate body consisting of six members including a
full-time Chairman and three full-timae members for Generation, Transmission
and Distribution, and for Finance. The other two members of the Board are
part time and comprise GOMP-s Finance Secretary and Energy Secretary (Annex
11). MPEB-s organizational charts suggest well defined responsibilities for
its operating units in the headquarters, regional divisions and prdject
sites. Transmission and distribution responsibilities, including commercial



-12-
activities, are carried out by four regional Chief Engineers who supervise
about nineteen circles each headed by a superintending engineer. MPEB
executes considerable part of its development program with its departmental
organization.  It also owns and runs two workshops for fabrication of towers
for high-tension lines, up to 400 kV, and structures for substations.
Staffing
2.04    At the enid of 1982/83, MPEB had about 63,000 regular employees and
about 30,000 workers employed on a daily wage basis (Annex 11). About 18,000
employees of its regular labor force and at least 90% of the daily wage
workers are engaged in construction activities. On this basis, operat:ion and
maintenance staff total 44,000 employees, giving a ratio of about 48
consumers per employee which, although high, is acceptable when compared to
other SEBs in India. All the sanctioned positions in MPEB at the top
management and middle management levels are filled.  Vacancies at lower
levels do not represent more than 8% of the sanctioned posts.
Training
2.05    MPEBs Central Training Institute at Jabalpur conducts intensive
induction courses for engineers and chemists prior to their regular
appointment.   The normal training period is one year for engineers and. 15
months for chemists, and covers technical, administrative and accountinLg
subjects. For diploma holders, induction courses are provided for 3 months
in four training centres. There are also two training centres which provide
training for linemen. Similarly, thermal power plant operators are trained
for 3 to 6 months under supervision of training staff at the Korba and
Amarkantak power plants.  In addition to these in-house training
arrangements, the Board has been sending its personnel to attend various
courses organized by institutions in the country or abroad on managerial and
engineering aspects related to its activities (Annex 12).
MPEB Accounts
2.06    MPEB's accounting system is not fully in line with accepted
commercial accounting practices. Moreover, it has not implemented the State
Government directive issued in July 1979 to adopt the revised forms of annual
accounts prescribed by CEA in consultation with the Comptroller and Auditor
General of India. However, M1PEB, under the Third Rural Electrification
Project, agreed to introduce, from April 1, 1984, a system of commercial
accounting to be prescribed by GOI (similar undertakings have been submitted
by fourteen SEBs). GOI has initiated the preparation of a suitable unified
SEB accounting system.  The consultant retained by GOI to develop the nlew
system completed, in January 1984, a preparatory report which was due in June
1983. In view of this slippage and other considerations, GOI now proposes to
initroduce the new accounting system from April 1985 and that local
consultants be hired by each SEB to verify and adjust the existing accounts



-13-
and to provide the necessary guidance and training during the initial stage
of the system implementation.  GOI provided in February 1, 1984 (letter
DO:10(4)83-FIN) the schedule for the implementation of the uniform commercial
accounting system in all SEBs starting from April 1985. This schedule was
confirmed during negotiations. It was also agreed that MPEB will introduce,
from April 1985, a uniform commercial accounting system satisfactory to GOI,
with the assistance of a local consultant whose terms of reference will be
provided to the Bank by June 30, 1984. In addition, it was agreed that,
given the delay in the introduction of the uniform commercial accounting
system for the SEB, the proposed system of Project accounting including
manuals, regulations, and formats would be provided to the Bank by October
31, 1984.
Data Processing Facilities
2.07    MPEB-s existing computer is used for billing (25% of MPEB's urban
consumers), inventory control for transmission and distribution stores,
revenue returns, staff records, and payroll for the Jabalpur District (2,200
employees). Expansion of existing computer applications and introduction of
new ones, considered essential to MPEB's proper management and operation, are
not possible however due to the limited capab:ilities of the existing data
processing facilities. In this regard, the computer services should be
extended to cover new areas such as system operation (plant dispatch, load
management, interruption analysis, demand and consumption analysis),
managerial accounting, budgetary control, project management and cost
control. In addition, the existing services should also be extended to cover
billing for all consumers and inventory control for all power generation
stores. These improvements are part of the proposed Project.  It was agreed
that the consultants required for the upgrading of MPEB's data processing
facilities will be retained by December 31, 1984.
Audit
2.08    The audit of MPEB is undertaken by the Comptroller and Auditor-
General of India, who has satisfactory completed the audit report for 1981/
82 with substantial emphasis on MPEB-s performance as a commercially oriented
entity. It was agreed that Madhya Pradesh shall cause the Board to furnish
the Bank, not later than nine months after each fiscal year, with its
financial statements for such year as certified by an independent auditor and
not later than twelve months after the end of such year, the audit report by
said auditor.
Transmission and Distribution Losses
2.09    At present MPEB-s transmission and distribution losses are about
22.2% of the energy supplied, which is the highest in India. MPEB attributes
the high losses mainly to low load density (kW/Km2), restrictions on power
supply and to the extension of the low tension distribution system. In



-14-
MPEB's financial projections system losses have been progressively reduced to
reach 18% in 1989/90 and contained at that level. However, the measures
required to produce this gradual reduction in system losses have yet to be
confirmed. MPEB and GOI have been asked to submit, by negotiations, a plan
of specific and quantified measures designed to gradually reduce the system
losses to 18% by 1989/90; this plan should address both technical and
nontechnical losses, and include proposals to reduce each category with
annual targets to be achieved. The Indian delegation furnished to the Bank a
program for the control and reduction of system losses. However, the program
needs to be worked out in further detail to meet the Bank-s requirements.
Therefore, it was agreed that MPEB will provide a more detailed program
satisfactory to the Bank before May 31, 1984, and control its energy losses
in accordance with the agreed program.
Insurance
2.10    MPEB follows standard practices for insuring elements being procured
for ongoing projects against total or partial loss. For permanent
installations MPEB holds policies which conform to the accepted utility
practices in India in terms of the nature and amount of coverage.
Taxes
2.11    SEBs are liable to income tax; however, because of the nature and
size of the investment program MPEB is not charged tax payments. Due to the
intensive capital expenditure of MPEB between 1983/84 and 1991/92, an income
tax liability will not arise in the foreseeable future and accordingly, a tax
equalization reserve is not necessary. Besides, GOI is now considering a
recommendation of the Committee on Power to exempt SEBs from income tax.

III. THE PROJECT
Background
3.01    The proposed 500 MW hydropower station under the Project is located
in the Bastar District in the State of Madhya Pradesh, some 1,200 km
southeast of New Delhi on the Indravati river (Map No. IBRD 17747). The
project was prepared by CEA, CWC, and MPEB staff and was submitted by GOI for
Bank consideration in September 1982. Two preparatory missions visited India
in October 1982 and June 1983, and appraisal took place in October 1983.
3.02    GOI, as part of its policy to rationalize the use of the country's
energy resources and to make a more efficient use of its power generating
potential, has decided to emphasize hydropower development. India's power
system is predominantly thermal, based on coal fired plants, and the absence
of a balanced blend with hydropower has led to either improper and expensive
operation of thermal stations as peaking facilities or, even worse, peak
shortages. This situation is particularly serious in the Western Region
where 78% of the capacity is thermal and in MP where 90% of the total is coal
fired plant. The chronic peaking shortages in the region have resulted in
widespread load shedding, overloading of the existing plants, increased
operating costs and, as a consequence, less than required thermal unit
maintenance. The proposed Project, which is the least cost option for the
Western System expansion, is geared to alleviate this situation.
3.03    In parallel with the more intensive development of its hydropower
potential, GOI is committed to the improvement of the performance and
utilization of the thermal plant already in place. Due to a number of
factors, thermal plant availability in India (65%-70%) is much less than what
would be a reasonably good performance (about 80%) for India's conditions.
The main reasons for this situation appear to be: a) lower than expected
quality of coal, leading to overloading of coal handling facilities and to
rapid wearing of the equipment, b) poor quality of some equipment components
resulting in increased forced outages, c) problems with instrumentation and
monitoring of the units, and d) impossibility of performing proper
maintenance due to system overloading. In order to remedy this situation,
GOI is considering a major national thermal rehabilitation program. However,
the problems and issues to be faced in a nationwide program of this magnitude
are not fully clear and a smaller pilot project is indicated as a first
phase. Such a pilot project of this nature has been included as part of the
proposed Project, with the intention to replicate it in other States.



-16-
Project Objectives
3.04    In addition to the primary objective of increasing the generating
capacity of the state of Madhya Pradesh and thence of the Western Region,
the project will assist GOI in achieving objectives on which the Bank has
agreed, namely:
(a)  More efficient use of existing plant, through the implementation
of the pilot program of thermal plant rehabilitation in Madhya
Pradesh, and
(b)  Improvement of MPEB operations by expanding and modernizing
data processing services to cope with the commercial and
managerial needs of the Board.
In addition, to assist in the definition of electricity metering
policy in in India, GOI has agreed to carry out a study on metering practices
in a number of selected states which is expected to be completed before May
1986. Terms of reference for a proposed metering study were provided
previously to GOI by the Bank and these have been taken into account in
defining the scope of the GOI study. The results of the study will be made
available to the Bank for comments.
Project Description
3.05    The proposed project will include the following components:
(a) The construction of a 500 MW hydropower station, including:
(i) A powerhouse housing 4x125 MW turbogenerating sets and
associated electrical and mechanical equipment.
(ii) A combined gravity rock-fill dam about 90 m high and 1,650 m
long in the Indravati River.
(iii)  A water conductor system composed of a head race tunnel of
about 12 m in diameter and 3,000 m long, a surge tank, and four
pressure shafts about 400 m long and 6 m in diameter;
(iv) About 5 km of open tailrace channel;
(v)  Step-up transformers (11/220 kV), switchyard equipment, and
about 5 km of 220 kV double circuit transmission line to
connect the project, to the nearby existing Barsoor
substation.



-17-
(b)  The execution of a thermal plant rehabilitation program in the
State of Madhya Pradesh, including the purchase and installation of
elements for repair and upgrading of the thermal units.
(c)  The expansion and modernization of the MPEB data processing
facilities, including development of software and purchases
of necessary computer equipment.
(d)  The necessary site services and facilities.
(e)  The associated consulting, engineering, training, and
administrative services required to carry out parts (a) to (d)
of the project.
Transmission
3.06    Load flow analyses carried out by CEA for the Western Regional grid
indicated that it will be necessary to reinforce the existing Barsoor-Bhilai
transmission system when the project is commissioned. MPEB's medium term
investment program includes for this purpose a 400 kV single circuit line (to
be initially energized at 220 kV) between the two substations. The line is
not financed under the proposed Project but assurances were obtained that
MPEB will complete the necessary transmission works before December 31, 1990,
and that the detailed engineering for this transmission system will be
completed not later than June 30, 1986.
Project Cost
3.07    Table 3.1 shows a summary of project costs.  The total cost of the
Project, including contingencies but excluding about US$85 million in taxes
and duties is estimated at US$638 million equivalent, of which US$213 million
(33% of the base cost) represents the foreign exchange costs. Interest
during construction adds another US$214 million to the financing required. A
capitalized front end fee on the proposed Bank loan adds approximately a
further US$0.4 million. The project cost estimates are based on December
1983 actual prices for similar works. Price contingencies, amounting to
about 27% of the base cost, are based on expected inflation rates of 7% for
FYs84 and 85, 8% for FYs86 and 87, and 6% thereafter for local costs, and
7.5% for FY84, 7% for FY85, and 6% thereafter for foreign costs. Physical
contingencies of about 15% on civil works and 5% on mechanical and electrical
equipment have been allowed, amounting to about 11% of base cost. The cost
of civil works is based on recent quotations received in India for similar
projects and on updated State rates applicable to Government contracts in
Madhya Pradesh. The cost of the turbo-generator sets has been estimated
after consultations with manufacturers of major rotating equipment. The cost
of electrical and mechanical equipment is also based on data on recent
purchases of similar items by MPEB. The cost of the elements of the thermal
rehabilitation program was estimated on the basis of quotations for similar
I



-18-
equipment and materials received by MPEB. The cost of the consulting
services required for the implementation of the Project was estimated at
US$11,500 per man-month for foreign consultants and at US$3,500 equivalent
for local consultants, including fees, travel, and subsistence expenses. An
amount of 10% of the base cost has been assumed for engineering and
administration. Interest during construction has been added, assuming that
80% of the cost would be financed through borrowings from GOMP (paras 2.01
and 3.08). The rates for GOMP loans to MPEB have been established by the
State Government as follows: 1983/84, 7.4%; 1984/85, 7.5%; 1985/86, 7.6%;
19886/87, 7.7%; 1987/88, 7.7%; 1988/89, 7.8%; 1989/90, 7.9%; 1990/91, 8.0%;
1991/92, 8.1%.  The front end fee on the Bank loan has been calculated at
0.25 of 1%, assumed to be capitalized under the loan. Annex 13 presents
detailed cost estimates for the project.

Project Financing
3.08    The proposed Bank Group financing for the project amounts to US$300.4
million, representing 47X of the total cost, net of duties and taxes. Of
this total, SDR 134.4 million (US$143 million equivalent) will be financed
from IDA's Special Fund under stanidard terms for such credits, and US$157.4
million (including the capitalized front end fee of about US$0.4 million)
will be an IBRD loan at the prevailing variable rate of interest to be repaid
over 20 years, including a 5 year grace period.  Bank Group funds will
finance about US$200 million (79%) of the total foreign exchange costs and
US$101 million (15%) of local costs, net of taxes and duties. MPEB will
cover 20% of the total financing required (US$187 million equivalent), and
the balance, US$450 million equivalent, will be financed by GOI, through
GOMP, in accordance with the onlending terms outlined in para 2.01. It has
been agreed that GOI will seek to finance about US$85 million equivalent,
representing the foreign component of the turbogenerator sets and associated
equipment, through suppliers' credits, export credits or commercial bank
loans, if the contract for turbogenerators is won by a foreign supplier. All
cost overrun, interest rate and foreign exchange risks will be borne by the
GOI. Assurances were obtained that MPEB and GOT, through GOI4P, will provide
for the necessary funds for project implementation in a timely manner. It
was also agreed that, if cofinancing is arranged for the turbogenerators, the
Bank would seek to reallocate any Bank Group funds not required for this
purpose to other elements of the project as appropriate. Table 3.2 shows the
proposed financing plan.

The US$55.1 million in foreign exchange not financed by the Bank corresponds
to interest on the IBRD loan, (about US$41.4 million) and to part of the
foreign component of locally procured equipment (about US$14 million).
Construction Schedule
3.09    The project will be executed over a period of 7.5 years, starting
early 1984. Commissioning of the first unit is expected in October 1989 with



-20-
the other 3 units following at 3 months intervals. The last unit is expected
to be commissioned by June 1990. Final works on the dam, not affecting
operation of the units, will be completed by September 1991. To achieve
this, the following schedule needs to be met:
Award of Contracts for Dam                October 20, 1984
Award of Contract for the Wiater
Conductor System                     October 20, 1984
Award of Contract for the Excavation
for the Powerhouse                   August 1, 1984
Award of Turbogenerators Contract         November 30, 1984
Award of Contract for the Tail
Race Channel                         October 20, 1984
The proposed construction schedule prepared by HPEB, shown in Annex 14, is
considered realistic.
Project Engineering
3.10    The Project site has been investigated for several decades but
systematic studies began only in the early sixties. Since then GSI has
carried-out the geological site investigation, including about 3,500 m of
exploratory drilling. Moreover, between 1965 and 1979, CWC collected and
analysed hydrological information, developed the project concept and prepared
preliminary designs. These works served as the basis for the formal adoption
of the project by GOI in 1979. Since then, designs have been refined and
additional explorations have been carried out as needed. Following the
Indian practice in this respect, CWC has been responsible for the civil
engineering of the project and CEA for ,he electromechanical aspects. Both
organizations have experience in similar projects as they have served as the
engineers for most of the hydropower and irrigation schemes in India for
several decades. The engineering for the hydroelectric plant has been
completed at a level sufficient for bid invitations and detailed construction
drawings are under preparation. Bids for major civil works will be invited
by late May 1984.
3.11    At the request of the Bank Group, MPEB appointed, in July 1983, a Dam
Review Panel (DRP), consisting of independent experts retained under terms of
reference acceptable to the Bank, to oversee the technical design and
construction aspects of the Project. DRP in its first meeting in August
1983, concurred with the general layout of the Project. In addition, the
Bank Group retained specialists in geology, hydrology and concrete dams to
assist the appraisal mission in carrying out the technical review of the
Project. After their review, the Bank Group consultants found the Project
technically sound and endorsed the proposed layout and design.  The
consultants proposed a number of modifications to the designs and location of
the dam to improve the reliability and economy of the Project, These changes
do not imply substantial alterations to the Project as proposed by GOI and



-21-
would be accommodated during the completion of the final design. Moreover,
although nearby geological exploration and surface geology of the modified
dam site location indicate a sound foundation, the consultants recommended a
program consisting of about 1,350 m of additional deep borehole drilling, to
confirm the geological conditions and the final foundation treatment. At the
time of negotiations 35% of the total exploration program had been completed
under the gravity section of the dam revealing a problem free foundation as
expected.
Project Implementation
3.12    MPEB will be the implementing agency for the Project.  CEA and CWC
will provide engineering and consulting services to MPEB. Their
responsibilities will include, but are not limited to, the preparation of
tender documents, specification and construction drawings, the review of
costs, and general technical assistance during project construction. MPEB
has assigned part of its staff to work on project design with and under the
direction of CEA and CWC. In addition, it has been estimated that about 400
man-months of private consulting services, as outlined below, will be
required for the project, of which about 130 man-months are expected to be
external and 270 local consultants. MPEB has also created a project
executing unit under the Chief Engineer and proposed a 3 year staffing plan
which will be reviewed annually with the Bank Group. The organization
(Annex 16) and functions of the unit are satisfactory. This unit would be
responsible for the overall field construction management and supervision.
3.13    MPEB has units experienced in general construction management,
procurement, store management, etc. which will assist the Project unit, when
needed. MPEB, and the Bodhghat executing unit in particular, might need
assistance in contract management and in the supervision of tunnelling work.
In fact, MPEB's staff has had limited exposure in the areas of international
contracts management and underground excavation works. The appraisal mission
estimate that around 200 man-months of consulting services will be required
for this purpose. The proposed Project provides for this assistance. It is
estimated that assistance will be needed in project management, and dam
construction (95 man-months), tunnel construction (60 man-months) and
specialized consulting services in various aspects as needed (about 45
man-months).
3.14    MPEB staff have prepared a unitwise preliminary diagnostic of the
needs for the rehabilitation of thermal plants including cost estimates.
This assessment was used in defining the scope of the rehabilitation
component of the Project. However, in view of the nature of the works
involved, the rehabilitation program will be executed in the following phased
manner:
(a) review of the MPEB proposal by specialized consultants and
confirmation, and, revision if needed, of the physical works



-22-
to be carried out, including their economic justification
and ranking in merit order, relative priorities and
of the necessary improvements in operation and unit monitoring
practices, including an evaluation of the potential cost
savings to the system;
(b) preparation of the implementation plan comprising detailed
schedule for purchases, determination of quantities,
specifications and tender documents, schedule for execution of
works, manpower estimates, training, power substitution,
administrative measures, monitoring system, etc; and
(c) physical execution of works and training of operations
and maintenance staff.
It was agreed that, in regard to the improvement of the operations and
maintenance practices, MPEB will also prepare, before March 31, 1985 a
diagnostic for discussion with the Bank identifying the areas for improvement
and proposing the scope for further consultants review. The proposed terms
of reference for the planning and implementation of this component are
included as Annex 15.
3.15    The thermal rehabilitation component will be executed by MPEB with
the assistance of consultants retained in accordance with terms of reference
acceptable to the Bank Group. It is estimated that about 100 man-months of
consulting services would be needed. MPEB has extensive experience with
different sizes of thermal units totalling over 2,000 MW and staff
qualifications and numbers are considered adequate to properly carry out the
rehabilitation work. MPEB agreed to recruit and appoint consultants for
assisting in the identification, preparation and execution of the pilot
component of the project for thermal station rehabilitation in accordance
with terms of reference acceptable to the Bank Group, not later than December
31, 1984.
3.16    The upgrading of the data processing facility in MPEB will include
the development of additional software, purchase of computer equipment and
training of staff. It will be executed with the assistance of consultants
and in accordance with terms of reference satisfactory to the Bank Group.
Arouand 100 man-months of consulting services are estimated to be required
after a review of the studies already available on the Subject. The
consultants would assist MPEB in: a) defining the scope and priority of the
new computer applications or the expansion of the existing area, b)
formulating a plan for its implementation including selection of hardware and
software, according to GOI's norms and practices, c) setting a training
program for MPEB staff and d) assisting in the implementation of the expanded
system. Assurances were obtained that consultants for assisting in the
imp:Lementation of the upgrading of MPEB data processing facility will be
retained not later than December 31, 1984.

The 3 major civil works contracts for the dam, water conductor system, and
tail race channel will be awarded after ICB, and the balance (civil works for
the powerhouse, access roads, site buildings, staff quarters, and site
utilities) under LCB procedures acceptable to the Bank. Prequalification
will be required for the 3 major civil works contracts. Major local firms
are expected to be competitive for the civil works. Since the civil works of
dam will be financed from IDA's Special Fund, only certain selected
countriesl/ would be eligible to participate in the procurement of this item.
The turbogenerators, the main step-up transformers and the steel plates for
penstocks and gates, amounting to about US$100 million, will be subject to
ICB whereas miscellaneous equipment, amounting to about US$44 million, will
be procured under LCB procedures acceptable to the Bank Group. Foreign
suppliers will not be precluded to participate in LCB. It is expected that
local manufacturers will be competitive for all the equipment contracts.
Most of the items necessary for the thermal rehabilitation program are
expected to be subject to ICB (boilers, turbine rotors, pumps, etc.), some of
them, however, might need to be procured through limited tendering if the
amounts involved are small or the number of suppliers is limited, or through
direct purchases in the case of proprietary items. MPRB will furnish in
advance for Bank approval lists of the items to be procured through limited
tendering or direct pruchase. About 75% of the goods, works and services for
the project will be procured under ICB. Local contractors, competing under
ICB, will have 7.5% preference margin for civil works and local manufacturers
a 15% preference or the applicable duty, whichever is less, for supply of
goods. Consultants would be selected in accordance with Bank guidelines.
All civil works contracts with an estimated cost of US$3 million or more
equivalent will be subject to Bank Group's prior review. All equipment
contracts with an estimated cost of US$800,000 or more equivalent would also
be subject to prior Bank review. Prior review will capture about 85% of the
estimated cost of the elements subject to commercial procurement. Other
contracts would be subject to selective post-award review.
Disbursements
3.18    Disbursements of IDA/Bank funds will be made against:  (a)  100% of
CIF price of imported goods; (b) 100% of the ex-factory cost of locally
manufactured goods; (c) 50% of local expenditure for other items procured
locally; (d) 100% of consultants' services; and (e) 60% of the civil works.
Disbursements would be fully documented except for (a) payments under civil
works contracts for one or more progress payments not exceeding Rs300,000
each, and (b) payments for locally procured items of equipment not exceeding
11 The eligible countries as of March 31, 1984 are: Australia, Belgium,
Canada, Denmark, Finland, France, Germany, Iceland, Ireland, Italy,
Luxembourg, New Zealand, Norway, Sweden, United Kingdom, and Part Dwo
Countries.



-25-
Rs150,000 each. Such disbursements will be made against statements of
expenditures (SOEs), the documentation of which will not be submitted to the
Bank Group but retained for inspection by the supervision missions. The
standard procedure for auditing SOEs will apply. Annex 17 shows the
estimated disbursements schedule as derived from the construction program,
considering the normal commercial payment terms for the types of contracts
envisaged for this project. The schedule is considered realistic for this
kind of project. Since there is no previous information on typical
disbursement profiles for hydro power projects in India, (this is the second
Bank Group financed hydro station in India), no meaningful comparison can be
made in that respect. However, the Project's disbursement profile fits
closely the Bankwide pattern for similar power projects. The closing date
would be June 30, 1992.
Water Rights
3.19    The Indravati river, in which the project is located, is an
interstate river flowing from Orissa into Madhya Pradesh. Further
downstream, it forms the boundary between Madhya Pradesh and Maharashtra.
The joint utilization of the Indravati is regulated by the agreements reached
among the States. The agreements are part of the final report of the
Godavari Water Disputes Tribunal. According to the agreement, Orissa will
ensure at its border 45 billion cubic feet in the Indravati and its
tributaries at 75% dependability. The planning of the Bodhghat project takes
into account the interstate agreements.  Thus, there are no standing
interstate water rights issues regarding this project.
Land Acquisition and Resettlement
3.20    Total land area required for the project is about 13,250 ha of which
about 4,650 ha (35%) is private property, 5,480 ha (41%) is State owned
forest land, and the balance (24%) is owned by the Revenue Department of
India. The surveying and valuation of the private plots, have been already
completed and the notifications of purchase to the landowners have been
issued. Valuation of property (houses, fruit bearing trees etc.) is also
underway. Land for compensatory afforestation and relocation of outsees has
also been identified and is already owned by the State.
3.21    About 2300 families are expected to be displaced during 6-7 years
construction and reservoir filling period, of which about 75% are tribals.
MPEB has prepared a resettlement program setting priorities for the transfer
of the affected population in a sequence consistent with the construction of
the project. The Government of Madhya Pradesh has constituted since 1982 a
Rehabilitation Committee under the chairmanship of the Bastar Divisional
Commissioner. This committee is represented by district level officers of
Revenue and Tribal Welfare, and other concerned departments and elected
representatives of the people of the affected region. The committee is
responsible for the identification of suitable areas for resettlement of the



-26-
outsees from the project area and to ensure that the affected population are
provided with alternative means of subsistance in addition to payment of
adequate compensation for any private properties acquired. The committee
will also oversee the execution of the environmental protection program (para
3.22). Of the 2300 families to be relocated 519 own more than 5 acres of
land, 403 own less than 5 acres, and the balance are landless peasants. All
will receive 5 acres plots each and adequate cash compenssation as
applicable. MPEB has already selected four adjointing tribal areas where
state land is available to compensate the affected population. Sufficient
funding provision have been made in the project estimates for acquisition
of land and properties and no problems are expected in this regard.
Sufficient funds have been also allocated for the construction of housing and
related infrastructure and facilities to relocate the displaced population.
It was agreed that MPEB will report quarterly, starting in December 1984, on
the progress of the resettlement program. MPEB will also provide, by June
30, 1985, a plan for proposed Tribal Training Center at Barsoor, which will
provide training for tribals affected by land subsurgence.
Environmental Aspects
3.22    The Project has been cleared by the Department of Environment (DOE),
GOI, and by the Wild Life Wing of the Madhya Pradesh State Forest Department.
The studies carried out by the Forest Department indicate that the project
area does not have any flora or fauna or any rare species which would suffer
by the construction of the project. DOE has indicated that the project
authorities should take a number of measures to promote preservation of wild
life, minimize soil erosion, and prevent health problems as a consequence of
the project. Adequate funding provisions have been made in the project
estimates to carry out the environmental protection program including the
compensatory afforestation of around 5,000 ha, and the promotion of fish
farming in the reservoir itself. Since a number of the envisaged
environmental actions need to be planned in further detail assurances were
obtained that MPEB will furnish the Bank Group, before June 30, 1985, with:
a) Detailed plan for the wildlife buffer zone around
the perimeter of the reservoir shore line including
map, schedule, staffing and detailed budget.
b) Details of the fisheries and water management program
(locations, budget, staff, schedule).
c) Details of the compensatory planting component
(sites, schedule, detailed budget, etc.).
Project Operation
3.23    The catchment area of the Indravati river at Bodhghat (15,280 km2)
amounts to 37% of the total basin area and the project is located in the



-Z7-
middle range land of the basin. As mentioned in para 3.19, the interstate
agreements have been considered in the planning of the project and there are
no meaningful water uses downstream of the powerhouse than may in any manner
constrain the plant operation as planned. The average annual inf ow into the
reservoir over a period of 34 years has been estimated at 5287 Mm of which
4998 Mm (95%) occur during the monsoon period (June to October) and the
balance during the Son-monsoon season (November to May).  Live reservoir
capacity is 3715 Mm or 70% of the average annual inflow (74% of the average
monsoon season inflow). According to the inflow series, the reservoir
filling can be accomplished in one year, as planned, with 90% probability.
3.24    Reservoir operation analysis indicate that with the full abstraction
of Orissa's water share, as per the interstate agreements, the proposed
project will generate 104 MW (911 GWh) of firm power at 90% dependability and
241 GWh annually as secondary energy during the monsoon season. During the
initial 10-15 years of operation, however, generation will be more since
Orissa's development of water uses is planned in two stages. In this initial
period the firm power will be 111.5 MW (966 GWh) and the annual secondary
energy, 380 GWh. The plant is planned to be operated as a peaking facility.
It is expected that, when fully commissioned, the plant will operate five
hours daily during the dry months at full capacity and between nine and seven
hours daily during monsoon, allowing adequate time in the season for
scheduled maintenance of the units. Charts C-1 to C-4 show typical daily
dispatch of the station in different wet and dry months in 1990-91. Details
are provided in Table T-1.
Project Monitoring
3.25    MPEB has agreed to submit quarterly reports covering physical
progress, consultants work progress, costs, disbursements, and administrative
aspects of the project. In addition there will be annual reports on the
financial position and management situation of the Board. Progress on the
loss reduction program will be reported quarterly and evaluated against the
agreed program (para 2.09). Special provision has been made to monitor the
pilot thermal plant rehabilitation project including the evaluation of
results (Annex 15). Finally, assurances have been obtained during
negotiations that MPEB will arrange, in a manner satisfactory to the Bank,
for periodic inspections of the works constructed under the project in order
to ensure their safe operation and proper maintenance.
Project Risks
3.26    There are no extraordinary technical risks associated with the
Project since the works to be constructed are well within the boundaries of
known engineering technology. Necessary modifications to the layout and
design concept of the Project have been introduced to improve safety and
reliability of the proposed structures. Confirmatory site exploration have
indicated a sound foundation for the dam. Reservoir watertightness and bank



-28-
stability has been confirmed by the Bank Group's independent consultants.
Sediment loads have been investigated and studies show that the 700 miLlion
cubic meters of dead storage would be sufficient for around 100 years, or
twice the economic life of the project, which is considered satisfactory.
The risks associated with potential poor construction, supervision or
contract management have been kept within acceptable limits by the provision
of appropriate consultant assistance to MPEB as needed. The risk of an
inadequate supply of funds to the project is low, considering that MPEB's
annual contribution to it would represent less than 5% of its annual
investments in 1983 and is expected to remain so during project
implementaion. Thus, the project does not pose an unduly heavily burden on
MPEB's finances. Satisfactory assurances were obtained during negotiations
that the necessary GOI contribution of funds to the project will be allocated
in 1984/85 and in the Seventh Five-Year Plan starting 1985/86.

IV. FINANCIAL ANALYSIS
Background to SEBs Finances
4.01    The financial operations of SEBs are regulated by the Electricity
(Supply) Act of 1948, amended from time to time to accommodate changes in
the environment of the subsector. In June 1978, several amendments were
introduced to enable SEBs to reorganize their finances along commercial
lines. The States, however, have not progressed much in adopting cormimercial
practices, mainly because of anomalies in the Act. SEBs are allowed to avoid
operating losses by not paying interest on Government loans, or by charging
less than full depreciation on their assets in operation; in addition, they
are not capitalizing interest during construction. Recently, following
discussion with the Bank Group, GOI has proposed new amendments to the Act,
aimed at removing the legal obstacles to the adherence by the SEBs to the
commercial principles of utility operations. These amendments would (i) set
financial objectives for SEBs based on accounting practices; (ii) outline
proper accounting procedures for handling debt service and the capitalization
of interest during construction; and (iii) introduce uniform commercial
accounting. These amendments were approved by Parliament in August 1983
(Annex 3). During negotiations GOI has agreed that the Electricity (Supply)
Amendment Act of 1983 shall come into force not later than April 1, 1985.
4.02    In line with the requirements established in the Third Rural
Electrification (Loan 2165-IN) to qualify for financial asssistance, fourteen
SEBs gave formal undertakings, which were endorsed by their State
Governments, to introduce measures that would improve their financial
performance.  These included:  (a) the realization of a net cash generation
of not less than 20% of their average annual investment, starting in 1982/83;
and (b) the limitation of the subsidies paid by the States to their SEBs to
cover rural electrification losses, to a proportion acceptable to the Bank
Group.
MPEB Financial Performance
4.03    Prior to Loan 2165-IN, MPEB was required under earlier Bank Group
agreements to achieve a rate of return of at least 9.5% on its net fixed
assets in operation, based on their historical value. MPEB met this
requirement in 1978/79 and 1979/80. However, it fell short of this target in
1980/81 and 1981/82 with rates of return of 8.2% and 7.8% respectively.
Furthermore, MPEB realized only a 5% net cash generation instead of the
required 20% iTn 1982/83 and it is expected that the net cash generation for
1983/84 will amount to only 1% (Annex 20). This low cash contribution to



-30-
investment is partly attributable to heavy MPEB investments during the period
as well as to less than required tariff increases.
4.04    Tariff increases in the past have favored agricultural and household
consumers and as a result industrial tariffs increased between 1978/79 and
1982/83 at an average annual rate of 20%, while low voltage tariffs decreased
in real terms. In January 1984, the average tariff paid by bulk and
industrial consumers, representing about 75% of the total consumption, was at
a level of about 90% of the LRMC while that for low voltage consumers, who
account for 25% of total consumption, was at a level of about 36% of the LRMC
of supply (Annex 18). In order to achieve the required 20% net cash
generation in 1984/85, the average revenue would have to be increased by
about 20% by April 1984.  As for 1985/86 to 1991/92, yearly increases ranging
between 2% and 7% would be required. The heavy initial increases required
are partly a consequence of the lumpy investments being carried out by MPEB
for a major capacity expansion to be commissioned in the coming two or three
years. Such increases would have a more significant effect on the low
voltage consumers since their tariffs are considerably less than the economic
cost of supply.  However substantial increases to the domestic consumers are
extremely difficult in view of the low consumption (only 25 kWh/month per
connection) and the need to maintain a basic minimum supply at affordable
prices. Similarly it is GOI s policy to maintain reduced tariffs for basic
irrigation uses on social considerations.  The low tension consumption for
irrigation averages about 85 kWh/month per connection. In view of these
reasons at time of appraisal the State Government felt that a 20% increase in
April 1984 would be unattainable.  Consequently, during negotiations, the
Indian delegation sought more time for complying with this covenant and
hence, it was agreed to accept their proposal for a gradual realization of
the cash generation target as follows: 8% in 1985/86; 17% in 1986/87; and
20% in 1987/88. The targets would be achieved through the combined results
of tariff increases, cost control, improved thermal efficiency, improved
billing and metering, and loss reduction. It was also agreed that a new
financing plan based on these targets will be prepared by GOI and GOMP and
will be provided to the Bank before May 31, 1984. The tariff increases
required to achieve the gradual realization of the cash generation covenant
will be about 16.4% at the beginning of 1985/86, 9.4% in 1986/87, and 6.7% at
the beginning of 1987/88. However, these increases may be revised on the
basis of the new financing plan to be provided by GOI.
4.05    In 1979 thirteen LRMC studies were prepared by individual SEBs, under
the guidance of the Bank Group. These studies, after being discussed with
GOI, have led the Bank to derive a uniform methodology for the calculation of
LRMC in India-s SEBs as well as the relevant computer program. The Bank
Group provided GOI, in March 1982, with the details of this methodology for
its consideration and comments. However GOI has not responded to the Bank
Group proposal in this regard. During appraisal it was found necesssary to
calculate the LRMC tariff for MPEB. This calculation was prepared on the
basis of an earlier study of LRMC carried out by the Board with the guidance



-31-
and assistance of the Bank Group. Because of the need for a uniform
methodology for the calculation of LRMC tariff in all SEBs, GOI agreed to
respond to the Bank-s proposed methodology before October 31, 1984.
Billing and Collectioil
4.06    At the end of FY83 MPEB had about 2,145,000 consumers, of which
434,000 (20%) were large industrial and commercial consumers, 1,311,000 (61%)
domestic, 373,000 irrigation pumps and 27,000 general consumers. Meters are
read monthly except for the low voltage sales, where meters are read every
two months. Bills are issued every month for all consumers. The bills for
low-voltage consumers in the month in which meters are not read are based
upon average consumption in the preceding fiscal year. In 1982/83 about 95%
of MPEB consumers were billed regularly, and about 72% of the revenue was
from HT consumption (950 consumers with individual demand of 5 MW and above).
About 94% of the revenues from all categories of consumers are collected
during the billing year (Annex 21) and accounts receivable during the last 3
years have been less than the equivalent of 3 months billing, an acceptable
level of arrears in India.
MPEB-s Financial Projections
4.07    CEA has prepared MPEB-s financial projections covering the period
between 1983/84 and 1991/92, based on financial data and information provided
by MPEB. CEA used the approved annual investments of the Sixth Five-Year
plan for 1983/84 and 1984/85 and the provisional annual investment figures of
the Seventh Plan which will commence from 1985/86. These investments are
expressed in current prices, escalated in accordance with the price
projections used by the Bank Group. The other assumptions used by CEA to
prepare the financial projections are included in Annex 21. However, the
financial projections suffer two principal shortcomings:  (a) the projected
tariff increases are lower than needed to achieve the 20% internal cash
generation required by the Bank Group, and (b) the annual expenses for
operation and maintenance are understated. Consequently, the attached
financial projections have been prepared to reflect the gradual realization
of the cash generation covenant besides taking in consideration realistic
assumptions for operation and maintenance expenses (Annex 21).
4.08    Presently, the security deposits collected annually are included in
determining internal cash generation. Consequently, changes in the size of
the deposits alters the level of cash generation. At the end of 1982/83,
the deposits amounted to about 0.76 of the monthly sales during that fiscal
year. In the financial projections prepared by CEA, a two-month level of
accumulated security deposits has been assumed. Since GOI and MPEB have
indicated that raising the security deposit is the SEB-s prerogative and is
achievable, agreement was reached during negotiations that MPEB will
gradually raise the level of consumer cash security deposits to reach two



-32-
months equivalency of sales by 1989/90 based on annual targets provided by
the Indian delegatiorn and found acceptable
Future Financial Situation

This projected financial situation is based on the gradual realization of
the cash generation to achieve 20% in 1987/88 and the required tariff
increases.
Debt/Equity Situation
4.10    SEBs obtain most of the funds for their investment by borrowing from
the State Governments. This practice has resulted in a debt oriented cap.ital
structure with almost no equity.  Currently 67% of MPEB's outstanding
long-term debt is in the form of loans from GOMP, resulting in a debt/equity
ratio of about 98/2.  Although the States are permitted to convert their
loaus to SEBs into equity or to make equity contributions to SEBs'
investments, the States have not taken any steps in this direction.  The Bank
Group has been discussing this issue with GOI, which is aware of the
seriousness of the situation. GOI and the Bank Group will continue the
discussion in future to seek an acceptable arrangement in this regard.

To finance its investment program (Annex 22), MPEB will depend on borrowing
from GOMP and others to meet about 81% of its requirement during the
projected period. In accordance with the undertaking given under the Third
Rural Electrification (Loan 2165-IN) MPEB will realize from 1984/85 to
1991/92 a total net cash generation equal to about 17% of the total
investment program for the period.

V. PROJECT JUSTIFICATION AND ECONOMIC ANALYSIS
Least Cost System Expansion and Project Sizing
5.01    In September 1982, CEA completed a 15 year least cost expansion plan
for each one of the five regional power systems (para 1.13) in India. The
computer model used for the exercise (WASP III, adapted) takes the committed
projects as fixed input and the new hydro and thermal projects, with their
associated capital and operating costs, as variables to determine the optimum
expansion sequence to meet the forecast demands. Generally, the results of
the plan indicate that, among the different options, the one emphasizing
hydropower development is usually the least cost one and that high forced
outage rates increase the costs significantly. The plan also indicates that
mine-mouth coal fired plants should be generally favored against load center
ones. In the Western Region expansion program, Bodhghat was considered as a
committed project. To confirm that the project remains part of the least
cost expansion, the Western Region program was updated to: a) treat the
project as a variable, b) take into consideration slippages that have occured
in ongoing and future projects since the plan was prepared, c) update demand
forecasts and d) use economic costs.
5.02 The present worth of the updated, previously optimized, expansion
program (investment, fuel, and O&M costs) with Bodhghat was compared with
the most realistic alternative plan without the proposed project. This
alternative would include a pit head thermal station in the Mand-Raigarh area
which would be added as base capacity displacing the less efficient and old
thermal units towards the peak operation. Gas turbines option as a peaking
alternative was found to be more expensive than the mode of operation
mentioned above. The thermal equivalent capacity for Bodhghat has been
calculated considering the lower availability of the thermal units when
compared with the hydro ones, as 840 MW. The necessary allowances for the
associated transmission have been included in the base case (with Bodhghat)
and in the alternative.
5.03    Costs of the two alternative expansion series have been expressed in
economic prices. CIF prices have been applied where possible, otherwise a
standard conversion factor of 0.8 has been applied. Unskilled labor was
valued at 0.75 of the market wage. The economic cost of coal at the pithead
was estimated as its long run marginal cost of extraction due to its



-35-
non-tradable naturel/ (RsI72/ton). Operation and maintenance for thermal
installation has been included at 2.5% for thermal and 1% for the hydro
(Annex 24). A summary of the results follows:
Present Worth of Plan
Discount rate                   With Bodhghat          Thermal Alternative
(Million Rs)
12%                            61,403                   66,054
10%                            72,052                   78,062
8%                            86,234                   94,173
Capacity Optimization
5.04    The optimum capacity of Bodhghat is 500 MW.  To test the optimum
capacity, 400 MW and 300 MW have been analyzed. It has been assumed that if
Bodhghat is reduced it would be necessary to install equivalent thermal
capacity in the system which will operate at the base displacing the rest of
the plants towards a more peaking operation. Given the shape of the load
duration curve and the loading pattern when Bodhghat is commissioned, this
operation would imply that part of the medium range thermal installations
would operate at a lower than present load factor and in a more inefficient
manner, although for less time than before the introduction of the new base
capacity. This net effect on fuel costs for the system has been considered
for the optimization analysis, the net incremental system costs of a capacity
lower than 500 MW at Bodhghat are as follows in million Rs:
Discount Rate   Capacity   Net Incremental System Costs
(MW)            (Million Rs)
8%             300                 1018
400                  637
10%             300                  812
400                  521
12%            300                   658
400                  433
As it can be seen, capacities of Bodhghat lower than 500 MW result in higher
present worth of system expansion. A summary of calculations and assumptions
1/ Indian coals have generally low calorific value (4500 kcal/kg) and high
ash content (40-45%) which render them non-competitive for export
markets.



-36-
is shown in Annex 24. Site limitations do not permit the development of ;more
than 500 MW at Bodhghat due to the impossibility of safely accommodating two
power tunnels (which would be required for higher capacities) through the
narrowest sections of the ridge under which the water conductor system has
been projected.
Cost Benefit Analysis
5.05    A two stage approximation approach has been adopted for the
quantification of economic benefits arising from an expansion of generating
plant that is integrated into an existing and growing system: (i) average
retail tariffs in the Region have been assumed to represent a proxy for the
minimum willingness to pay for power; and (ii) in order to quantify some
additional consumer surplus beyond this minimum, the cost incurred by
industrial consumers in maintaining and operating standby generating sets
has been assumed to represent a proxy for industrial consumers' maximum
willingness to pay for continuous power supply.
5.06    The incremental amount of energy sold is adjusted to account for
system losses typical of the Region. The weighted average of expected 1984
tariff revenue at retail level in the Region has been estimated at
RsO.536/kWh (USc54/kWh), and converted to border prices for purposes of the
comparison with economic cost. The industrial tariff revenue is replaced by
the observed average willingness to pay for continuous power supply,
amounting to about RsO.64/kWh (USc6/kWh) in economic terms (Annex 23).
5.07    Corresponding to the definition of economic benefits as willingness
to pay at the retail level, additional costs of transmission and distribution
investment (including operating and maintenance expenses) have been allocated
to the cost of the expanded system in line with the general Regional
investment pattern. Benefit and cost streams as well as the ERR calculations
are presented in Annex 24.
5.08    The minimum economic rate of return is about 11%, falling to about
9.2% if more pessimistic cost and benefit assumptions are tested. The true
internal rate of return is likely to be considerably higher than the minimum
quantifiable estimate if the consumers' and derived producers' surpluses cf
industrial, agricultural, and commercial consumers are taken into account.
It would be even higher if indirect benefits accruing to the Indian economy
are fully considered. Benefits accruing to the non-industrial consumers are
likely to be understated by the use of the tariff as benefit proxy. Using
only retail tariffs as measure of the benefit, the internal rate of return of
the program is about 8.5%, falling to about 7.3% with more pessimistic
scenarios. These results indicate that retail tariffs including electricity
duty in the Region are economically inadequate to ensure an acceptable
financial return on the proposed expansion program.



-37-
5.09    It is not possible to prepare a meaningful quantitative economic
justification of the thermal plant rehabilitation program at this stage due
to its pilot nature. Adequate provisions have been made for the consultants
to assess the cost effectiveness of the different actions to be taken and of
the program in its entirety. Preliminary estimates indicate that some 100 MW
of additional power could be obtained with the program at an average cost
of US$250/kW, which is indicative of its high cost-effectiveness.
Justification for Bank Participation
5.10    Bank participation in the project would facilitate the continuing
dialogue with GOI about the achievement of agreed sector objectives. This
project will offer the Bank the opportunity to be directly involved for the
first time in a SEB-owned project enabling it to promote the implementation
of managerial and financial procedures established for the sector (commercial
accounting, adequate cash generation, improved management, etc). On the
technical side the standards currently used for preparation of engineering
and contract documents intended for international bidding need to be
imrpoved. In fact, there is no substantial experience in this regard in the
hydropower sector in India, since most of the existing projects have been
constructed through a combination of local contractors and force account.
With the increased emphasis on hydropower in India and increased external
financial assistance for hydropower projects engineering standards more in
line with the international procurement practice will be necessary. This
project would expose CWC and MPEB to major international procurement and
through the envisaged independent consultants assistance it is expected that
substantial improvements in the engineering standards can be achieved to be
used in future projects. The project also addresses one of the more pressing
needs in India, the better use of existing thermal facilities. It is
expected that based on the results of the proposed thermal plant
rehabilitation pilot project, GOI will have a better understanding of the
issues involved in the preparation of a more ambitious, project. Finally the
project will serve as a vehicle for studies on electricity metering
practices, leading eventually to a definition of a general policy in this
respect, and to better billing and collection practices.

1/  Demand forecasts prepared for the National Power Plan by CEA, using
different methods for different consumer categories.  The industrial
demand forecast is based on empirical relationships between growth of
electricity consumption and growth of value added in Industry; irrigatiou
pumping forecasts are dependent on the planned rate of new pump
connections, the expected utilization rates, and the replacement rate of
diesel pumps. Residential and commercial use is extrapolated from past
relationships over time. Two scenarios, depending on assumptions of
higher or lower growth of industrial value added, have been developed.

NOTES:
1.  The above figures give the number of sanctioned posts as on March 31, 1983.
2.  There is no sanctioned strength of daily wage workers and they are engaged as per work needs.
3.  There are no vacancies in categories No. 1 to 7.
4.  The extent of vacancy in categories No. 8 to 12 varies from 7.5 to 10%.
5.  On an average basis 50% of staff carrying out common functions is engaged in activities related to project & construction & 50% on 0&M.
6.  Similarly a part of staff for O&M in the Distribution & Civil Eng. activities also performs sizeable construction works.  As a result about 8658
posts out of a total of 35525 posts in column 5&6 are utilised for construction works also.  The total No. of regular persons engaged in construct-
ion activities thus comes to 8058+8749 (total col. 7,8,9&L0)+1488 (50% of col. ll)-18895.
7.  The strength of O&M personnel comes to 44094.
8.  Daily wage workers engaged in O&M works comes to 10% of total numbers of 29636, rest is engaed in construction work.
9.  The annual rate of growth of employees strength has been nearly 8 to 10% in the past.  However, in coming 3 years, except meeting full staff
requirement of Thermal & Hlydel projects and project works, the Board would be exercising control over staff iucrease and establishment expenditure NoI
in pursuance of the emphasis laid by Government of India and Planning Commission over reducing employees strength and expenditure.                               |X

Thermal Plant Rehabilitation
Suggested Terms of Reference
Objective
1.      The objective of the work is to formulate and execute a program to
upgrade the performance of the existing thermal plant in the most cost
effective manner. The program will include, but not limited to, a review and
improvement of the physical installation, the operational procedures, the
plant management and support services, and the identification of the training
needs of the staff. Consultants would assist in the preparation and
implementation phases as needed.
Phases
2.      The proposed program is to be developed in three phases whose precise
scope will depend upon the results of the precedent phase. GOI and MPEB have
carried out diagnostics of the physical conditions of the units which will be
taken as a basis, to be verified and modified as appropriate by the
consultants. The general scope of each phase is described in the following
paragraphs.
Phase I
3.      During phase I MPEB staff and the consultants would identify and
select the corrective actions to be proposed in the program, including their
economic justification and ranking in merit order. In this phase MPEB staff
and the consultants should in particular:
(a)  Review the already existing reports or studies on the subject
prepared by GOI and MPEB.
(b) Confirm, modify or expand the proposals contained in the above
documents through visits and inspections to the units,
discussions with MPEB staff, and review of the existing
information about the units performance and operation.
(c) Review and analyse the operation practices, the reliability,
accuracy and relevance of the data being collected by MPEP,
the quality of their analysis and the use being made of the
information.
(d) Review the practices for maintenance planning and scheduling.



-65-
ANNEX 15
Page 2 of 3
(e)  Assess the need for staff training and for administrative
changes in the operation and maintenance if needed.
(f)  Review the support systems like management of spares, fuel,
etc.
(g)  Assess the quality of the monitoring system, and
appropriateness of the instrumentation being used.
(h)  Develop cost estimates for the different corrective units and
prepare a cost-benefit analysis to rank them in merit order.
4.      At the end of this phase I the consultants will prepare a report with
their findings and recommendations, the cost estimates, and a tentative
implementation plan.
Phase II
5.      During this phase MPEB and the consultants will develop a detailed
implementation and monitoring plan to carry-out the measures selected under
phase I. In addition the consultants will assist in the development of the
engineering, technical specifications, drawings, and packaging of the
procurement. Among other aspects the following should be considered:
(a)  Organizational set-up for implementation
(b)  Procurement schedule including recommended packaging and
procurement procedure to be followed (ICB, LCB, etc.) for
each package
(c)  Repair schedule for each unit considering its operational
commitments and the options for power substitution
(d)  Staff needed to carry-out the program by speciality and timing
(e)  Training program of the staff
(f)  Program for changes in procedures and practices
(g) Monitoring for physical progress, cost control and results of
the program, including the preparation a model for progress
reports.

Notes
On CEA Assumptions for the Financial Projection
1.      Financial projections were prepared by CEA with assistance from MPEB
and are based on audited FY82 and provisional figures of FY83. The six
Five-Year Plan ending in FY85 has been taken as base for MPEB investment
program and starting from FY86 preliminary figures for the seventh Five-Year
Plan have been used.
2.      The projections prepared by CEA incorporate price escalation of
operating and investment costs in accordance with current Bank Group
guidelines.
3.      The fuel cost  has been considered by MPEB on constant heat value.
In case of new units increased fuel consumption is considered. Price
escalation has been incorporated.
4.      Depreciation has been calculated - on a straight line basis - at a
rate of 3.7%1/ of gross fixed assets in operation at the beginning of each
fiscal year.
5.      Two changes have been considered by the appraisal team in the
financial projections as prepared by CEA:
a.  increasing the average revenue per KWh sold to level that
allows the agreed cash generation covenant to be met;
and
b.  adjusting the operation and maintenance expense to reflect
the cost increase due to system expansion.
6.      Assumptions prepared by CEA are attached.
1/ Between 3.2% and 3.5% of the average gross fixed assets in operation at
the beginning and at the end of the fiscal year.

consumption) minus the average losses for the region, estimated to be at 18%
at the time of project commissioning.

Industrial Willingness to Pay
3.      A proxy for industrial willingness to pay for continuous power supply
is obtained as the average between the regional industrial tariff in the
region (Rs 0.52/kWh financial and Rs 0.41 economic) and the cost incurred by
industrial consumers for the purchase and operation of diesel standby
generating sets to back up public supply.
1/ Only firm energy has been considered for this analysis.

The average benefit proxy for industrial consumers is Rs 0.64/kWh in economic
terms. If the benefits accruing to other consumer categories are valued at
their respective weighted averages of regional tariffs, we obtain the
following:

Optimization Analysis - Basic Assumptions
- Equivalent thermal capacity per 100 MW hydro assumed to 120 MW thermal
unit (the closest practical size to the equivalent thermal capacity for
100 MW hydro) to be added to an existing plant.
- Unit economic cost estimated at 5000 Rs/kW (based on economic costs for
Farakka minus common works not needed for additional units in existing
plants).
- The unit can be commissioned after five years of construction start.
- Additional units assumed to be located at Mand-Raigarh.
- Transmission 220 kV line CD/C).
- Cost of fuel at pithead (including oil for start ups and flame
stabilization): RsO.18/kWh.
- Fuel consumption 0.7 kg/kWh at base, 0.85 kg/kWh at peak as per CEA records.
- Transmission losses: 2%
- Auxiliary consumption for the thermal station: 9%
- Annual O&M charges for thermal unit 2.5% of cost, and 2% for transmission
lines.
