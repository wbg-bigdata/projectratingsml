MEMORANDUM AND RECOMMIENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT OF THE IBRID
TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS ON A PROPOSED LOAN
TO THE REPUBLIC OF PANAMA
FOR A RURAL HEALTH PROJECT
1.   I submit for your approval the following memorandum and recommendation on a
proposed loan to the Republic of Panama for US$25.0 million equivalent to help finance a Rural
Health Project. The loan would be at the Bank's standard variable interest rate, with a maturity
of 17 years, including five years of grace. The total project cost is estimated at US$41.7
million.
2.    Background. Panama's GDP per capita was estimated at US$2,570 in 1993. Social
indicators for the country as a whole are comparable to other middle-income countries, with
wide regional variations that reflect a skewed distribution of income, past public investments and
social expenditures. In 1988 half of the households in Panama were below the poverty level.
Critical poverty affected about one third of households, concentrated in deep pockets of poverty
in peri-urban and rural areas. The 28 poorest districts (out of a total 68 districts) where most
of the project beneficiaries live, are characterized as follows: (a) over 50 percent of households
have monetary incomes insufficient to buy a minimum food basket; (b) 40 to 70 percent of
children are growth retarded by the time they enter school; (c) about 30 percent of households
do not have access to safe drinking water and basic sanitation; (d) 40 to 50 percent of
households do not have access to primary health care services; and (e) infant and child mortality
rates range between 40 and 75 per thousand live births, two to five times the national average,
reaching levels found in low-income countries. The spread of cholera since 1990 has heightened
the health risk posed by waterborne diseases, sihns, most of Panama's rural water supply systems
do not provide for disinfection. Unless adequately addressed this trend threatens to undermine
the effectiveness of Panama's considerable health expenditures, which reached 19.6 percent of
total Government expenditures and 5.6 percent of GDP in 1992.
3.    Past development policies to redress poverty issues have had shortcomings that include:
(a) a bias in investment and social expenditures that has favored population groups living in the
more affluent Panama City-Col6n metropolitan area; (b) overly sophisticated infrastructure and
equipment that are costly to operate and maintain; (c) an excessive reliance on the State to
provide basic services, and a parallel failure to mobilize the capabilities of the private sector,
nongovernmental organizations (NGO) and beneficiaries to contribute to the development
process; (d) insufficient monitoring of environmental conditions; and (e) overly complex,
centralized financial and administrative procedures. The proposed project has been designed to
address these issues within the context of the Government of Panama's (GOP) poverty alleviation
strategy.
4.    Government Strategy. GOP's development strategy is centered on an economic and
social recovery program which is presented in the accompanying Country Assistance Strategy
statement. To further the social objectives of its economic recovery program, GOP has prepared
rehabilitation programs for the public health system administered by the Ministry of Health
(MOH) and the Social Security Fund, and for the water and sewerage authority that serves the
urban population. To develop its human resource base and alleviate poverty, GOP adopted a



2
National Food and Nutrition Prograin (PRONAN) in 1992, that defined new strategies and
programs for addressing priority issues in food production, distribution, and malnutrition. It
also adopted a Human Development Program (PRODESHU) that defned the parameters of a
mult.sectoral investment program to alleviate poverty, including agriculture, forestry,
infrastructure, and social projects, estimated to cost US$200 milion over 1993-1997. Parts of
these programs are already being implemented by: (a) the Social Emergency Fund (FES) funded
by USAID and the GOP; (b) a Pilot Nutrition Project under the Economic Recovery Loan (Ln.
3438-PA, 1992); and (c) an Agro-foety project (International Fund for Agricultural
Development).
5.    To complement the above actions, GOP reque-sted Bank assistance to support the ongoing
PRONAN and PRODESHU objectives. In particular, these include the reduction in the high
rates of malnutrition, especially among young children, and the inadequate access to safe potable
water and basic sanitatior. in rural areas. GOP policies and strategies in the social sectors and
for poverty alleviation, with specific reference to its policies and strategies in the nutrition and
the water supply and sanitation subsectors, are presented in a Policy Letter submitted in support
of the proposed project. The letter demonstrates GOP's commitment to adopt a policy of
poverty alleviation and improve access to and quality of public services for the poor. Evidence
of the govemment's commitment to social sector reform include an ongoing Health Sector
Rehabilitation Project (IDB) that complements the proposed project by focussing on urban health
care and sector management capacity, as well as a recent request for Bank assistance in the
education sector.
6.    Rationale for Bank Involvement. The proposed project, the first Bank operation in the
social sectors in Panama, will follow up on issues of health and nutrition and of the efficiency
of social sector expenditures that were identified in the Economic Recovery Loan. The project
is fully consistent with the country assistance strategy, which is being presented together with
the proposed project, as it supports the objectives of poverty alleviation. The project will
improve the access of rural populations to basic servizes and strengthen the country's social
safety net. The Bank will assist GOP to apply efficient targeting criteria, raise the quality and
coverage of basic health services and improve institutional and administrative capacity in MOH.
An analysis of the nutrition and environmental health subsectors was carried out in 1993 as part
of the preparation assistance for the proposed project. This analysis has helped GOP develop
its policy framework for investments in nutrition, rural water and sanitation, and in community
organization and participation. The results of lessons learned in the review of the sector have
been incorporated into the project design.
7.    Project Objectives. Project objectives are to: (a) reduce the incidence of malnutrition
from an estimated 40 percent at present to about 30 percent among young children, and breast-
feeding and pregnant women in the poorest 28 districts of Panama; (b) increase the covmrage of
water supply and basic sanitation in all of Panama's rural areas, from about 62 to 80 percent and
from about 72 to 88 percent, respectively; (c) train new and existing community water boards
to improve their capacity to operate and maintain systems under their responsibility; and (d)
strengthen the institutional capacity of: (i) the Subdirectorate General of Health Services
(SDGSP) of MOH to direct, monitor and evaluate the nutrition strategies and programs to be
implemented under the project; (ii) the Subdirectorate General of Environmental Health
(SDGSA) of MOH to perform ils statutory obligations to provide households in small rural



3
communities with access to basic water supply and sanitation infrastructure, and to define and
enforce environmental health regulations to protect the general public from waterborne
contamination and pollution; (iii) the Project Administration Unit (PAU) to coordinate and
administer the project; and (iv) the Ministry of Planning and Economic Policy (MIPPE) to
design and implement a national system for monitoring poverty alleviation efforts. The project
supports GOP's poverty alleviation strategy as it: (a) targets nutrition interventions to the poorest
districts; (b) contributes to human resource development by improving access to basic and
preventive health services; (c) involves the community in the project's design and
implementation; and (d) makes full use of NGO, private sector and community resources.
8.    Project Description. The proposed project consists of three components. (1) The
Nutrition Component (US$13.1 million, or 31 percent of total costs) is targeted to the 28
poorest districts and will help MOH to: (a) select, train, equip and supervise about 1,500
community health workers (CHW) and 120 health assistants (HA) to provide basic nutrition and
health services to about 75,000 rural inhabitants who lack adequate access to the public health
system; (b) introduce a complementary feeding program in communities with a trained CHW
and in about 250 MOH outpatient facilities, enrolling about 95,000 children under 5 years of age
and about 20,000 breast-feeding and pregnant women, who are either seriously malnourished
or at risk of serious, chronic malnutrition; and (c) provide refresher training to about 950 MOH
staff assigned to outpatient facilities. (2) Th Rural Water Supply and Sanitation Component
(US$21.3 million, 51 percent) will help MOH to: (a) construct new water supply systems in
about 450 unserved communities and expand/rehabilitate existing systems in about 250
communities, construct about 450 shallow wells equipped with handpumps, and provide latrines
and basic sanitation to about 30,000 households; (b) organize, train and supervise about 450 new
and 1,150 existing community water boards; and (c) establish and support the operations of a
national system of water quality control and a computerized information center on Panama's
water sources for rural areas and related water and sanitation activities. (3) Tne Institutional
Strengthening Component (US$7.3 million, 18 percent) will strengthen the operations and the
training programs for the staff of SDGSP, SDGSA, PAU and MIPPE by providing funding for
studies, participatory research, poverty monitoring, project reviews, staff training and project
administration.
9.    Project Costs and Financing. The total project cost, including physical and price
contingencies, is estimated at US$41.7 million, net of taxes, of which an estimated US$22.1
million (53 percent) is foreign exchange. Investment costs are 55 percent of total baseline costs,
and incremental recurrent costs, including complementary food (US$10 million over the project
implementation period), amount to 45 percent of the total baseline costs. The proposed Loan
of US$25.0 million finances about 60 percent of total project cost, net of taxes and duties. It
finances about 78 percent of foreign exchange expenditures and 39 percent of local expenditures.
It finances the food used in the complementary feeding program on a declining basis (US$5.8
million), which amounts to about 31 percent of the total incremental recurrent cost of the
project. The extent of local and incremental recunrent expenditures financing is justified to
promote the adoption by MOH of an efficient way of procuring and providing food rations. All
other categories of incremental operating expenditures, including taxes and duties, are financed
by GOP. The Government's contribution to the proposed project is US$15.4 million (37 percent
of total costs) and project beneficianres will contribute labor valued at US$1.3 million (3 percent
of total costs). Retroactive financing up to US$2.0 million, or 8 percent of the proposed loan



4
amount, is authorized for eligible expenditures (e.g., technical assistance, design and
implementation of a first batch of subprojects, and initial training of MOH staff, community
water board members, and community health workers) incurred after December 15, 1993.
Retroactive financing is justified to facilitate a timely implementation of start-up activities,
including subploject design, staff training and community mobilization efforts. A breakdown
of estimated costs and financing are shown in schedule A. Amounts and methods of
procurement and disbursement and the disoursement schedule are shown in Schedule B. A
timetable of key project processing events and the status of Bank Group operations in Panama
are given in Schedules C and D, respectively. The Staff Appraisal Report No. 12944-PAN,
dated December 16, 1994, is also attached.
10.   Project Implementation.  SDGSP and SGDSA of MOH will be responsible for
implementing the projwct, through the Central, Regional and local offices of MOH. They will
be supported by the services of other units of MOH, in accordance with their current
organizational responsibilities: the Social Participation tIepartment for training and community
organization activities; the Research Department for a baseline survey of health and nutrition
conditions; the Planning Directorate for project evaluations and a Project Administration Unit.
In addition, the services of the Social Planning Subdirectorate of MIPPE will be mobilized and
supported to develop a system to monitor living standards. To assist in the construction and
rehabilitation of rural water supply and sanitation systems, MOH will enter into an agreement
with FES to delegate to FES the administration of up to US$3.5 million of civil works (about
25 percent of total) in a manner that promotes maximum community participation. Annual work
programs for works to be administered by PES and built by private contractors or NGOs will
be agreed to between MOH and FES. The Nutrition Component will be implemented in ftfree
phases. PAU has been established to provide administr'Pve support for project activities,
including procurement and disbursement, according to streamlined procedures acceptable to the
Bank. Annual work program and budget reviews with Bank participation and a revolving fund
for GOP counterpart funds will be established to improve investment implamentation
performance. Contracting with private sector companies, individuals and NGOs will be
encouraged for civil works and training activities. Where contractors are not available, well
drilling and other project works valued at US$1.2 million (2 percent of total project costs) will
be carried out by force account using MOH's staff and equipment in the regions. In these cases,
the Bank will only finance the cost of the equipment and materials used.
11.   Project Sustainability. Project design contributes to sustainability by: (a) requiring the
regular GOP budget to finance aUl incremental operating expenditures, except food which wiUl
be financed by the proposed loan on a declining basis, (b) organizing communities to operate
and maintain basic infrastructure, requiring them to contribute to the capital costs of rural water
supply and sanitation investments; and (c) setting water tariffs at levels that are affordable and
that at least cover operatirg and maintenance costs. The estimated net incremental opeating
cost necessary to sustain the project's benefits is about US$3.2 million annually, or less than 3
percent of MOH's 1993 recurrent budget. It includes the full cost of the complementary feeding
program and supervision and technical assistance by bcal MOR officials to the communities.
12. Lessons from Previous Bank Involvement. The key lessons learned from similar
projects and incorporated in the project design are the need for: (a) project preparation
arrangements to create a high level of commitment to project objectives, and to design the



5
components taldng into account the institutional capacity of implementing agencies (b) clear,
simple project design and implementation arrangements, with a built-in provision for review and
adjustment; (c) careful attention to developing and defining implementation arrangements; (d)
agreement on explicit, measurable progress, and monitoring and result-oriented indicators; (e)
mobilizing the community's participation in all project phases, and especially for operations and
maintenance, to promote sustainability of project benefits; and (f) basing food supplementation
programs on efficient targeting criteria and accompanying them with growth monitoring and
nutrition counseling. These lessons have been incorporated into the project design, including:
(a) GOP commitment has been secured through extensive discussions, the Policy Letter and
through a post-negotiations mission that reviewed the project and the legal documents with the
Panamanian Administration that took office in September 1994; (b) annual and midterm reviews
of the implementation perfonnance of Annual Work Progams, with agreed quarterly
performance targets by regional offices to provide opportunities to adjust project implementation
as needed; (c) institutional strengthening is a major component of the project and focuses on
MOH's capacity to implement the project; (d) a table of monitoring indicators and a performance
review process were agreed upon; (e) a participatory strategy was adopted to actively involve
community groups and ensure the sustainability of project impacts; and (f) explicit targeting of
Panama's poorest 28 districts (out of 68) was utilized, and within these districts only
malnourished preschool children and pregnant and breast-feeding women will be eligible for
complementary food rations.
13.   Agreed Actions. During negotiations, agreement was reachtd on: (a) the final text of
the Policy Letter submitted to the Bank; (b) terms of reference and follow-up procedures for
conducting the annual and Midterm project Reviews; (c) the number, profiles and time of
appointment of additional permanent staff required to implement the nutrition and the rural water
supply and sanitation components; (d) the final versions of the project procurement procedures
and standard bidding documents; (e) project start-up expenditures eligible for retroactive
financing; (f) procedures to open a revolving fund account for GOP's counterpart funding; and
(g) a set of key monitoring indicators for project activities, financing, outcomes and impact. As
conditions of Loan effectiveness, GOP will have: (a) appointed suitably qualified and
experienced managers to head MOH's Potable Water, Basic Rural Sanitation and Quality Control
Departments and the chief engineers of SDGSA's five regional offices; (b) adopted a satisfactory
manual of project rules and procedures; (c) opened a bank account for the revolving fund with
an initial deposit of US$0.5 million; (d) appointed to the PAU a suitably qualified and
experienced procurement officer, accountant and financial officer; and (e) submitted a
satisfactory Annual Work Program for 1995. As a condition of disbursement for the purchase
of food supplements and medical equipment, MOH will have adopted and started to implement
a satisfactory action plan for the Pilot Nutrition Program - Chiriqui (PNP-C). The PNP-C aims
to: improve the nutritional status of vulnerable groups; increase attendance of health clinics and
posts; provide better coverage of key preventive health programs and to train HAs and CHWs.
Its implementation is being monitored to validate the acceptability and efficiency of mechanisms
to target food rations and to promote community participation in the delivery of basic nutrition
and health services.
14.  Poverty Category. The proposed project is a Program of Targeted Interventions. It
directly seeks to reduce the two leading indicators of household poverty: child malnutrition and
the lack of access of the household to potable water and basic sanitation. The design of the



6
Nutrition Component incorporates both geographical and individual targeting mechanisms: its
introduction is limited to the 28 poorest districts and only malnourished members of the
vulnerable group consisting of children under 5 years of age and pregnant and breastfeeding
women will be eligible. The design of the Rural Water Supply and Sanitation Components
incorporates criteria that target the rural communities: those that have either not been served in
the past or in which over 30 percent of the population is not currently served. Overall, the
population of project beneficiaries has a significantlv larger proportion of poor people than
Panama's population as a whole,
15.   Environmental Aspects. The proposed project will have no adverse environmental
impact and will help to reduce soil and water body contamination by: (a) improving disposal
of human excreta and waste water; (b) institutiag a system of regular controls of water quality;
and (c) encouraging appropriate watershed management practices. It is classified Category C.
16.   Project Benefits. The Nutrition Component will improve the nutrition and health status
of the population living in the 28 poorest districts of Panama, which account for about one third
of the country's total population. In particular: (a) about 75,000 people living in remote,
isolated rural communities will gain access to primary health care services, including nutrition,
through the training, deployment and support of CHWs; and (b) about 20,000 pregnant and
breast-feeding women and 95,000 children under 5 will be enrolled in complementary feeding
programs over the life of the project. Taken together, these actions are expected to reduce the
incidence of malnutrition among preschool children and pregnant mothers within the 28 districts
covered, from about 40 percent to about 30 percent. In addition, training programs for MOH
staff and imrproved technical supervision will improve the quality of nutrition services delivered
in these 28 districts. Improved nutrition and health status and better use of preventive health
care services will reduce the need for hospital and outpatient health services and will increase
the efficiency of public expenditures for health. The Rural Water Supply and Sanitation
Component will provide access to safe water and to basic sanitation for about 175,000 and
150,000 unserved rural inhabitants, respectively.- Efforts to organize, train, provide technical
support and supervise community water boards will improve the quality of water delivered and
the sustainability of rural water sector investments and will help protect the environment.
Benefits of safe drinking water and basic sanitation are well known and include: better health
of families, reduction of nfant and child mortality and morbidity, increased time for productive
work and child care, and higher school attendance. The Institutional Strengthening
Component will: (a) improve knowledge about health issues affecting the poor and the
responsiveness of national policies to these issues; and (b) strengthen the capacity of MOH to
set policies and norms for nutrition, water supply and sanitation, and to design, implement and
evaluate projects.
17.  Program Objective Category. The project is a poverty reduction and human resource
development operation.
18.  Participatory Approach. The project has been designed to promote community
participation in identifying and developing appropriate responses to the health, nutrition and
sanitation needs of the intended beneficiaries, to contribute to project investments, and to assist
in delivering basic services and in maintaining and operating project financed infrastructure.
During the preparatory stage, MOH invited representatives of local communities, officials and



7
NGOs to workshops and informal meetings to develop proposals. During implementation,
communities will play a major role in selecting and supporting the activities of CHWs, HAs and
Community Water Boards which are essential to sustaining project benefits. Recourse to NOOs
to carry out civil works and for training and supervision activities is envisaged. The project
supports a program of participatory research on health and nutrition related household behaviors.
The Mid-term and project evaluation studies will include assessments of beneficiary attitudes and
support of project activities.
19.   Risks. The proposed project faces three main risks. The first risk is the limited
managerial and administrative capacity of MOH to implenunt investment projects. This risk
has been attenuated by: (a) the appointment by the new Panamanian administration of
experienced managers to head the key headquarters divisions and departments responsible for
project implementation; (b) improvements in the organizational structure of MOH impler-ented
by the new administration; (c) the preparation of a detailed manual of project opeLating
procedures setting out, inter alia, the mandate of SDGSP and SDGSA to direct project
implementation, the project's internal planning, budgeting and monitoring procedures, the role
and support functions of PAU and the streamlined administrative procedures to be used; (d)
arrangements for having FES administer part of the water supply and sanitation construction
program; and (e) annual and Mid-term project review mechanisms that provide flexibility to
adjust planned project activities to demonstrated institutional capacity, while strengthening that
capacity.  The second risk is the Limited institutional capacity of MOH and NGOs in
organizing and supporting local communities and in delivering services and supervision in
remote areas; and of the community water boards in operating and maintaining water systems.
This risk has been attenuated by: (a) the inclusion of an institutional development component to
strengthen the management and technical capacity of the MOH at both the central and
decentralized levels; (b) training programs and seminars for the working level staff of MOH and
community workers and water board members; and (c) close involvement of the Bank in a
project launch seminar that will be held at the time of loan effectiveness. The third risk is the
possible delay in the provision of counterpart funding. This risk is a'tenuated by: (a)
Government assurances that Annual Work Programs will be prepared and reviewed with the
Bank in a timely manner permitting agreements to be reached on the required level of budgetary
allocations and counterpart financing for the following year, before the limit date for submitting
MOH's annual budget request to the National Assembly; and (b) the establishment of a revolving
fund to meet GOP's counterpart funding obligations.
20.   Recommendation. I am satisfied that the proposed loan complies with the Articles of
Agreement of the Bank and recommend that the Fxecutive Directors approve it.
