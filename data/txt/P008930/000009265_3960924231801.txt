KARAKAYA HYDRPOWER PPROJECT (LOAN 1844-TU)
PROJECT COMPLETION REPORT
Preface
This is the Project Completion Report (PCR) for the Karakaya
Hydropower Project in Turkey, for which Loan 1844-TU in the amount of US$120
million was approved on May 15, 1980. The loan was closed on December 31,
1988 and fully disbursed on March 13, 1989.
The PCR was prepared by the Energy Operations Division, Country
Department I of the Europe, Middle East and North African Regional Office
(Preface, Evaluation Summary, Parts I and III). Part II of the PCR has been
prepared by the State Hydraulics Agency (DSI) on behalf of the Borrower.
The findings of this PCR are based on the Staff Appraisal Report;
the Loan Agreement; supervision reports, correspondence between the Bank and
the Borrower; and internal Bank memoranda.

TURKEY
KABAKAYA HYDROPOWER PROJECT (LOAN 1844-TU)
PROJECT COMPLETION REPORT
Evaluation Summary
Introduction
A loan of US$120 million was made to the Republic of Turkey in 1981
for the above project. The project was the fourteenth Bank group operation in
Turkey's power subsector, and was a continuation of the Bank's assistance,
started in 1952, for developing the subsector and increasing utilization of
indigenous resources.
Objectives
The principal objectives of the project were to expand power
generation based on indigenous resources and improve usage of the Keban
hydropower plant upstream, as well as to continue the institution-building
efforts under earlier projects following establishment of the Turkish Electricity
Authority (TEK) in 1970, improve power sector planning and financing policies,
and possibly promote riparian coordination in the use of the Euphrates waters.
Ipjlententation Experience
Project ^n'-..ruction, originally expected to be completed in December
1986, was not completed until February 1989, but generally proceeded smoothly
after resolution of initial contract problems with the civil works contractors.
A relatively simple contracting arrangement providing for only two main
contractors for, respectively, the civil works and the supply and installation
of the electro-mechanical equipment, and a strong project management team at the
project site with sufficient authority to solve site problems without having to
seek DSI headquarters' approval, helped to overcome problems during construction
(in stark contrast to the experience with the Elbistan Thermal Power Project
[Lns. 1023 and 2650 TU] which was completed at about the same time, but more than
eight years behind schedule).
Results
Of the project's two main objectives, one was satisfactorily
achieved.   The completed facilities provide additional capacity to meet the
power demand in the national power system and enable better use of the Keban
hydro power station upstream, although optimum utilization will only be achieved
after completion of an additional, southern transmission line which is included
in the Fourth TEK Transmission Project (Ln. 2586-TU). The achievement of the
institutional objectives of the project, i.e. to improve power sector planning
and financing policies, and contribute towards riparian coordination in the use
of the Euphrates waters, was far less satisfactory, and indeed disappointing.
The financial target for the public power subsector, i.e. a net internal cash
generation of 35% of public power sector investments, has also not been met in
recent years.   Thus,  most of the project's  institutional goals were not
accomplished.



- iii -
The estimated 11.8% rate of return of the project falls short of
the 15.1 estimated at appraisal, mainly because of the delay in completing the
project and the fact that tariffs are lower than expected at appraisal.
Appropriate  resettlement measures  were  taken  for  the project.    Loss  of
agricultural and grazing land in the reservoir area was the main environmental
impact, along with limited impact on archaeological and historical sites.
Since the beginning of 1986, the year of reservoir filling, the
Borrower has not submitted quarterly reports to the Bank on the Euphrates river
flows as required under the loan agreement. However, according to the project
completion report submitted by the borrower, river flows, which had been reduced
to 140 m3/s for about 1h months prior to commencement of impounding, were
completely interrupted for only eight days before again reaching the normal
monthly average minimum of 500 m3/s. The Borrower has also failed to transfer
the cost of the project, including interest during construction, to TEK in the
form of equity, as required under the loan agreement.   Since creation of the
1-ublic Participation Fund (PPF) in 1985, all hydropower facilities constructed
by the State Hydraulics Agency, DSI, rather than being transferred to TEK, have
been retained by the Government in order to mobilize funds through a levy,
payable by TEK to the PPF, on the power generated at these facilities.
Substitution of this PPF levy on TEK (payable in cash) for the depreciation (not
involving a cash outflow) which TEK would have provided on Karakaya and other
hydropower facilities if the Government of Turkey (GOT) had continued the past
practice of transferring such facilities to TEK as equity, has substantially
aggravated TEK's financial difficulties in recent years.
Findings and Lesson
The lesson to be learned from this lending operation is that
institution-building efforts will not be successful unless there is a firm and
continuing commitment on the part of the Borrower to the agreed goals, and the
Borrower is prepared to intervene in a decisive and timely manner to initiate
any actions that may be warranted.

Country     :    Turkey
Sector            Energy
Subsector   :     Power
2.    Background
2.01        At the time the Bank was approached for funding the above project
in 1975, Turkey had actively studied plans for the development of the water
resources of the Euphrates Basin since 1962, and formulated projects for
irrigation and power.  In 1974, it completed the first stage of the 1,260 MW
Keban hydropower dam. The Bank chaired the syndicate for the financing of this
project and assisted in the financing of the associated transmission system.
Karakaya represents the second stage in the basin development program and
involves primarily regulation of the water released from the Keban reservoir for
hydropower generation.   The Karakaya project,  like Keban, does not involve
irrigation, nor abstraction of water from the Euphrates river other than for
initial filling of the reservoir.
2.02        In order to ensure that reservoir filling and operation of Karakaya
would not adversely affect the lower riparians, Syria and Iraq, the filling and
operating rule proposals were evaluated by the Bank on the basis of a model
developed by the Bank in 1974. As a result of this evaluation it was ascertained
that if Turkey maintained an average monthly discharge of water of at least 500
cubic meters per second, as the Euphrates passes from Turkey into Syria, this
would ensure that the existing downstream requirements for power generation and
irrigation and reasonable growth during 1975-85 could be met and that the Turkish
power plants could be operated for maximum energy output.  Moreover, it also
confirmed through the model that the Karakaya reservoir could be filled in a
reasonable span of time. This operating rule was named the "Rule of 500".
2.03        After considerable discussion, an informal agreement was reached in
1976 between the Government of Turkey (GOT) and the Bank on the "Rule of 500"
for  reservoir  filling  and  operation  of  Karakaya.    The  principles  were
communicated by Turkey to Syria and Iraq, and Turkey offered to discuss a
possible tripartite arrangement with these countries to monitor their
application. It was only then that the Bank decided to appraise the project.
However, following objections received from both Syria and Iraq, Board
consideration of the loan for the project was deferred.   In March 1979, an
official policy statement was endorsed in the Turkish Parliament that Turkey
would abide by the Rule of 500 during filling and operation of the Karakaya
reservoir, and that this procedure would continue as long as no unexpected hydro-
meteorological conditions developed and no other project was constructed on the
Euphrates which would require the use by Turkey of the waters of this river.



- 2 -
Turkey also formally represented that the Bank could rely on this policy
statement in considering its participation in the financing of the project. The
Bank was aware that the Rule of 500 agreed by the Turkish Government concerning
Karakaya was only an initial step in reaching a broader agreement among the
Euphrates river riparians, but considered it adequate to participate in the
financing of the project, despite the objections of Syria and Iraq. The project,
therefore, was reappraised in late 1979, and presented to the Board in May 1980.
2.04        Prior to approval of the Bank loan of US$120 million in May 1980,
the Turkish Government had obtained a bilateral credit from a group of Swiss
banks in 1977/78 for an amount equivalent to US$295 million to finance
principally the supply of the turbines and electrical equipment for Karakaya.
Additional financing was also obtained from the European Investment Bank (ECU
85 million, equivalent to US$110 million) and from Italy (US$20 million). Total
project cost was estimated at that time at the equivalent of US$1,160 million
(excluding interest during construction), of which US$602 million were foreign
expenditures. Expenditures up to 1979 were computed to be equivalent to US$241
million, with US$121 million equivalent in foreign currencies.
3.    Project Obiectives and Descrittio
3.01        The principal objectives of the project were to provide additional
generating capacity (1,800 MW and 7,353 GWh per year) for the Turkish Power
System and to enable better use of the upst -eam Keban hydropower plant (the
output of Keban would be increased by 400 GWh in an average hydrological year),
thus saving foreign exchange by substituting hydroelectric energy for imported
oil.  The other objectives were the continuation of the institution-building
effort started with the establishment of the Turkish Electricity Authority (TEK),
coordination in power sector planning among TEK, the State Hydraulics Agency
(DSI), the Ministry of Energy and Natural Resources, and the State Planning
Organization, the development of appropriate policies for power sector financing,
including energy pricing, and possible riparian coordination in the use of the
Euphrates river waters.
3.02        The project consisted of the construction of the Karakaya dam and
hydropower plant with a reservoir of 5,600 million cubic meters useful storage
on the Euphrates river, located about 160km downstream of the Keban dam,
comprising a concrete arch-gravity dam 173 meters high with an overflow spillway,
power intakes, steel penstocks, a powerhouse at the toe of the dam containing
six 300-MW turbine-generator units, a switchyard located 7.5km from the dam,
relocation of 33km of railway line, construction of 35km of new highways and
resettlement of about 17,000 people living in 34 villages.
3.03          During the negotiation of Loan 1844-TU, the Government agreed to
make arrangemeusts satisfactory to the Bank for securing the financing needed to
ensure completion by TEK of the 400-kV lines connecting the project with the
national power network. The Third and Fourth Transmissio,n Projects fulfilled
the undertaking. A 400 kV transmission line from the Karakaya switchyard to the
interconnected power system was constructed by TEK as part of the Third TEK
Transmission Project (Loan 2322-TU).  Concurrently, TEK strengthened the 400-
kV national transmission network under the same project. Further expansion and
strengthening of this network is being done under the Fourth TEK Transmission
Project (Loan 2586-TU).



- 3-
4.    Prolect Design and Organization
4.01        Geological and site investigations for the project were comprehensive
and very thorough for the type of dam constructed. In the Bank's initial review
of the proposed project design, the adequacy of certain design features was
questioned, particularly the bottom outlet features. This prompted revision of
the original design with more reliable solutions for the project water handling
facilities in order to avoid problems such as those experienced with the Keban
project upstream, following which the Bank was satisfied with the project design.
Engineering consultants (a joint venture of two Swiss firms, a US firm and a
local firm) assisted DSI personnel at the project site during the entire
construction and commissioning phases.   This arrangement contributed to a
relatively trouble free engincering effort and to the successful completion of
the project.
5.    Project Implementation
5.01        Project construction (which preceded the approval of the Bank loan)
started in October 1976 and was expected to be completed by 1987. At the time
the Bank reappraised the Project in 1979, basic preparatory works had been
completed and construction of the diversion tunnel was nearing completion. The
construction equipment had also been brought to the project site and all
necessary facilities for the main construction works had been set up. The main
hydro and electrical equipment was being manufactured and deliveries started in
early 1980. For temporary storage of this equipment a large storage facility
was under construction at the railway station about 30km from the project site.
However, the Italian-Turkish joint venture contractors for the main works (dam
and powerhouse) had slowed down construction activities because of delays in
advance and progress payments and concern about future project funding. That
led to serious disputes with the Owner (the State Hydraulic Agency--DSI). A
period of considerable tension and low morale ensued, until finally with the good
offices of the Bank both parties met in late 1979 and agreed to settle the
disputes amicably. As a consequence of resolving the basic disputes with the
construction contractors, a new project schedule was agreed and payment for work
carried out was expedited by means of a letter of credit. From then on, project
implementation proceeded smoothly to the start of reservoir filling in mid-
1986, completion of the dam including spillway in late-1987 and full
commissioning of the power plant (all six units) in February 1989, about two
years behind the date anticipated in the 1980 Staff Appraisal Report.
5.02        At appraisal it was found that although DSI's headquarters had
considerable experience in carrying out large hydropower projects, the site
management at Karakaya was not well structured and organized and that substantial
improvement was needed. Communications between the site and DSI's headquarters
in Ankara were inadequate; flights from Ankara to Diyarbakir (nearest airport,
located about 150 km from the site) were irregular and telephone connections
unreliable. Under normal procedures DSI's headquarters had full responsibility
for execution and funding of projects, with the consultants at the site acting
only as advisers and without responsibility for directing the contractors or
approving their proposals. However, since sound project management was essential
to the successful execution of a project of the magnitude and importance of



Karakaya, the Bank requested and the Government agreed to the establishment of
a project management team at the project site, and to the appointment at the site
of a manager with responsibilities, qualifications and experience satisfactory
to the Bank, and with sufficient authority to solve site problems without having
to seek DSI's headquarters approval. This arrangement worked out satisfactorily
during the entire project execution time spar   Contributing factors to the
smooth implementation of the project were           latively simple contracting
structure, providing for only two main contra;.    for, respectively, the civil
works and the supply and installation of the electro mechanical equipment, and
the assistance of a panel of internationally-known experts for periodic review
of the technical aspects of the project construction.
5.03        Problems during construction were primarily related to the civil
works. Severe rainfall in 1983 washed out part of the approach road to the site
as well as a major bridge, filled the excavation area on the left bank with mud
Lnd seriously damaged the roads and facilities at site.  Heavy stabilization
work, river diversion and dam excavation took longer than planned. The rate of
concreting of the dam in the later years (after mid-1985) was less than planned
because of more complex and thin sections at the higher dam levels. During the
overspeed test, the stator coils of a generator were damaged due to problems with
the ventilation fans. In order to avoid recurrence, the fans for all generators
were replaced.
6.    Proiect Results
6.01        Of the project's  two main objectives,  one was  satisfactorily
achieved. The completed physical facilities provide additional capacity to meet
the power demand in the national power system and enable better use of the Keban
hydropower capacity upstream, although optimum use will be reached only after
completicon of a further, southern transmission line which is included in the
Fourth TEK Transmission Project (Ln. 2586-TU). However, the achievement of the
institutional objectives was far less satisfactory, and indeed disappointing.
The overall results can be summarized as follows:
i.    Institutional Improvement of TEK: TEK has not yet achieved
the greater efficiency anticipated at the time of project
appraisal.
ii.   Coordination of Power See~tor Planning:   In this area very
little has been achieved and planning is still done with
insufficient coordination between the sector entities, the
Ministry of Energy and Natural Resources (MENR), and the State
Planning Organization.
iii.  Development of Appropriate Policies for Power Sector Financing.
including Energy Pricing and Power Sector Cash Generation:
Power tariffs have eroded sharply in real terms between 1986
and 1989, and even after recent adjustments still remain below
LRMC; and the financial target for TEK, a net internal cash
generation target of 35X of public power sector investments,
has not been met in recent years (para 9.02).



iv.   Riparian Coordination in the Use of Euphrates Waters:   A
compromise solution on long-term issues, and systematic
coordination of water useage on the basis of a unified model
for the Euphrates river has yet to be achieved.
6.02        The actual internal rate of return for the project, estimated at
11.8%, falls short of the 15.1% estimated at appraisal, mainly because of the
delay in completing the project and the fact that tariffs have been lower than
expected at appraisal.
6.03        Resettlement of the population affected by the project was organized
by DSI in close cooperation with the provincial authorities and the Ministry of
Agriculture. Forestry and Rural Affairs. The loan agreement required submission
of a resettlement plan and timetable for implementation by February 28, 1981,
and no significant difficulties were subsequently experienced in resettling,
ahead of reservoir impounding, the population of the 34 villages affected by
the reservoir.   During project supervision the Bank regularly monitored the
resettlement progress.   A consultant has reviewed progress on the specific
resettlement issues that needed to be addressed under the project. On the basis
of the information gathered during a mission to Turkey, he prepared a report in
1987 which outlined the legal and organizational resettlement arrangements and
the actual process followed: The report has concluded that the existing legal
and administrative system in Turkey governing involuntary resettlement is
basically sound, and that practices and procedures for resettlement, including
those relating to Karakaya,  are satisfactory.   The report recommended some
improvements in the areas of collection of socio-economic data, follow up, and
administration and coordination at site level, which have been communicated to
the Government and DSI, who have indicated that they would follow up on these
matters.   A limited number of disputes concerning the compensation for land
expropriated in the Karakaya reservoir area continues in the Turkish courts.
6.04         A study, based on terms of reference suggested by the Bank, of the
environmental consequences of the project, including physical, biological and
social impacts, was prepared by consultants in 1977. This was to be followed-
up by an ecological reconnaissance by the Bank's environmental staff but this
did not take place.   Intensive archaeological investigations made throughout
Turkey during the 1970s with the assistance of numerous foreign scientific
institutions, also covered the area which would be flooded by impoundment of the
reservoir, and the Bank assisted in the salvage of archaeological artifacts by
bringing authorities from Turkish universities and overseas into the project.
As previously noted (para 2.01), the project does not involve abstraction of
water from the Euphrates river for irrigation or other consumptive purposes and
is not expected to have major adverse effects for the downstream riparians as
long as the "Rule of 500" is maintained.   The project area and surrounding
countryside are generally bare and treeless, with practically no wildlife, and
restricted areas of agriculture. Loss of agricultural and grazing land in the
reservoir area was the main environmental impact, along with a limited impact
on archaeological and historical sites.

7.    Proiect Sustainability
7.01        The  principal  benefits  realized  from  the  project,  i.e  the
contribution to meeting the demand of the national power system, the savings in
imported fossil fjels in thermal power plants because of their replacement by
hydroelectric energy, and the financial revenue derived from the sale of the
energy generated by the project, will endure for the useful life of the project,
which is about 40-50 years.
8.    Bank Performance
8.01        The Bank played a role in making sure that   project management
arrangements were efficient (particularly by urging decentralized management at
the project site) and that financing was available in a timely fashion.   In
addition, the Bank assisted in the successful negotiations between DSI and the
main civil works contractors concerning delays in payment for work done
(para 5.01). The Bank was instrumental in improving the design of the project
by suggesting a number of changes, particularly regarding the bottom outlet
features.
8.02        The Bank closely monitored the institutional components of the
project. Hopes that TEK's institutional and financial performance would improve
were raised when, following major tariff increases in the years 1982-84, TEK's
internal cash generation reached, or came close to, the agreed targets in 1985
and 1986 (para 9.02) and when, after a waiver of the financial covenants for
1987, TEK's tariffs and capital were again significantly increased at the end
of 1987, and a new general manager brought in from the outside initiated a
reorganization of TEK. However, the increase of TEK's tariffs and capital (which
was not paid up until 1989), has since been largely eroded by inflation, and the
attempts to reorganize TEK had stalled by the time the new general manager left
TEK in September 1988. Power sector investment planning and coordination were
repeatedly examined during the Bank's public sector investment reviews and also
in the context of the preparation of the Energy Sector Adjustment Loan (2856-
TU) but, as noted in para 6.01 (ii), without lasting results.  A strategy to put
power subsector development back on track, discussed with the Government and TEK
in 1989 and 1990, provides for a restructuring program for TEK under a project
which is presently in course of preparation.
8.03        The Bank developed the Euphrates river basin model that was used in
devising the Rule of 500.   However, as noted in para 9.03, it subsequently
experienced increasing difficulties in monitoring the river flows.

9.    Borrower Performance
9.01        At project appraisal DSI was already a highly experienced government
agency, but overly centralized.   Since for a project of the magnitude and
complexity of Karakaya, it was essential to have adequate project management at
the project site, sufficient authority had to be, and was, delegated to the site
management.   The restructured site management as well as DSI's headquarters
organization performed satisfactorily during project implementation.
9.02        In retrospect, it is clear that there was insufficient commitment
on the part of the Government to the institution building objectives of the
project. As noted in para 6.01 (i) and (ii) little headway has been made in the
institutional improverent of TEK or in incroasing coordination of power sector
planning. The Government also has not lived up to its commitments concerning
power sector tariffs and finances. In accordance with the agreements under the
Karakaya loan, TEK's annual internal cash generation was to increase from 20%
of public power sector capital expenditures in 1981 to 35% in 1986. In addition,
to prevent working capital deficits from counting as a positive element in the
cash generation calculation, TEK agreed in 1983 under the Third Transmission Loan
(2322-TU) to maintain a current ratio of not less than 1.0 from December 31,
1984. Following major tariff increases during the period 1982-84 (during which
TEK did not meet the agreed cash generation targets), TEK did achieve a current
ratio of 1.16 in 1984 and a cash generation of 41% in 1985. Since then, however,
as a result, inter alia, of the Government's unwillingness to raise electricity
tariffs sufficiently to cover TEK's financial costs and debt service
requirements, cash generation has fallen from 31% in 1986 to an estimated -22%
in 1989, and the current ratio from 0.96 in 1985 to an estimated 0.50 at the end
of 1989.   1987, 1988 and 1989 were election years (general, municipal and
presidential), and 1988 and 1989 also years of heavy inflation, which may explain
why it was difficult to keep tariffs in line with the rapidly increasing costs.
As a result, technically, TEK has become insolvent.  A strategy to put power
subsector development back on track, discussed with the Government in 1989,
provides for a restructuring program for TEK under a project which is presently
in course of preparation.
9.03        The Borrower did not comply with the loan covenants concerning the
supply of Euphrates water flow data. When the Government decided in 1983 to seek
supplemental financing for the project from the Bank, the Bank considered that
as part of the appraisal of a supplemental loan, the riparian issue should be
re-examined, since Turkey had started construction of the large Ataturk dam
downstream of Karakaya involving power generation and abstraction of water for
irrigation. Accordingly a new and more elaborate model for the Euphrates Basin
was developed to review the issue in the light of new data and facts. In order
to update the data and analysis on which the Rule of 500 was based it was
essential to obtain figures on the water released from the Keban reservoir.
The Government declined to make these figures available to the Bank and decided
to seek supplemental financing elsewhere. Also, since the beginning of 1986,
the year of reservoir filling, the Borrower has not submitted quarterly reports
to the Bank on the Euphrates river flows as required under the loan agreement.
However, according to the project completion report submitted by DSI, river



- 8 -
flows, which had been reduced to 420 m3/s for about 1½ months prior to
impounding, were completely interrupted for only eight days before again reaching
500 m3/s in June 1986.
9.04        The Borrower also has failed to transfer the cost of the project,
including interest during construction, to TEK in the form of equity, as required
under the loan agreement. Since creation of the Public Participation Fund (PPF)
in 1985, all hydropower facilities constructed by DSI, rather than being
transferred to TEK, have been retained by the Government in order to mobilize
funds through a levy, payable by TEK to the PPF, on the power generated at these
facilities.   Substitution of this PPF levy on TEK (payable in cash) for the
depreciation (not involving a cash outflow) which TEK would have provided on
Karakaya and other hydropower facilities if GOT had continued past practice of
transferring such facilities to TEK as equity, has substantially aggravated TEK's
financial difficulties in recent years (para 9.02).
10.   Consulting Services
10.01       Given the technical complexity of the project, it was essential to
have the assistance of qualified consultants. This assistance was satisfactorily
provided by the joint venture of consulting firms led by an internationally-
known Swiss engineering consulting firm. Moreover, the panel of international
experts gave substantial assistance during construction, particularly regarding
stabilization measures on the canyon walls while excavation for the dam was
underway.
11.   Project Documentation and Data
11.01       The SAR was comprehensive and provided a useful framework for the
Bank and DSI during project implementation.   The project's legal agreements
reflected the Bank's interest in the satisfactory execution of the project and
in achieving the development objectives of Turkey's power sector. Supervision
reports gave a clear indication of the project status at any time and of any
major incident during construction. These reports together with the progress
reports provided sufficient documentary information for judging the project
results.
12.   Findings and Lesson
12.01       The lesson to be learned from this lending operation is that
institution building efforts will not be successful unless there is a firm and
continuing commitment on the part of the Borrower to the agreed goals, and the
Borrower is prepared to intervene in a decisive and timely manner to initiate
any actions that may be warranted.

PROJECT COMPLETION REPORT
PART II
DSI's Comments on the PCR
The policy of the Turkish Government regarding the management of
water resources in our region emphasizes maximum cooperation with the riparian
countries. In this context, the Tripartite Joint Technical Committee established
in 1983 with the initiation of the Turkish Government has held regular meetings
and discussed several issues concerning regional waters. Within the framework
of the Joint Technical Committee studies, Turkey has developed a comprehensive
unified plan for the equitable and optimum utilization of the Tigris-Euphrates
waters. This plan is based on the fact that the Euphrates and Tigris must be
considered as one transboundary water course system, since they are linked by
the Tharthar Canal in Iraq before merging as Shattel-Arab and this way the Tigris
waters could be used to support the future irrigation requirements in the
Euphrates valley.
It is believed that the Tigris waters will be adequate for this
purpose. This approach shall constitute a technical solution which will provide
"water svpply and demand balance" in the region.
So far, Turkey has consulted with the riparian states at the highest
political level as well as technical level in the Triparti:e Joint Technical
Committee and will continue in future to make strenuous and generous efforts to
reach a compromise solution on long-term issues.   However,  the process of
negotiation in respect of transboundary waters is always complex, delicate and
time-consuming.
In any case, based on the above mentioned facts, statements 'I on the
riparian rights which appeared in the Draft Completion Report for the Karakaya
Hydropower Project should be deleted to avoid misunderstandings.
A previous statement in para 6.01 (iv) to the effect that no
riparian coordination had been achieved, has been modified in light of the
above comments.

6.    Project Results
A. Direct Benefits
6.01        The principal benefits accruing from the project were the economic
and financial gains realized from the increased capacity to inject electric power
into the Turkish national power system.   The increase in capacity and power
generation since February 1989 are 1,800 MW and an average of 7,753 GWh per year,
of which 400 GWh represent the increase in generation at Keban.  In terms of
current tariffs this generation represents revenues equivalent to US$ 258 million
deflated to 1980 prices, and after deducting about 20% system losses.
B. Economic Impact
6.02        The SAR evaluated the internal rate of return (IRR) as the discount
rate which equalizes the stream of costs and benefits attributable to the
project. The 15X IRR estimated in the SAR was based on the following conditions.
(a)   Average sales of 6,910 GWh per year for 48 years (1987-2035),
and 2,473 GWh in 1975 and 5,678 GVn in 1986, at early-1980
electricity rates (average TL 2.8 per kWh);
(b)   System losses of 11%; and
(c)   Standard Conversion Factor of 0.59.
6.03        A similar approach was used in the re-evaluation of the IRR with
the following exceptions.
(a)   Final project Cost in early-1980 terms;
(b)   Average annual generation:  7,753 GWh, including 400 GWh at
Keban;
(c)   System losses of 20%;
(d)   Notional   incremental   investment   in   transmission   and
distribution of US$400 per kW of peak demand at the power
plant. This represents an incremental investment of US$720
million in transmission and distribution attributable to the
project; and
(e)   Average revenue at TL 4.63 per kwh in early-1980 terms.
6.04        On the basis set forth above, the IRR is calculated to be 11.8%.
The cost and benefits streams used calculating the re-evaluated IRR are shown
on page 14.
