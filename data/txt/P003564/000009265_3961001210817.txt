MEMORANDUM AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT
OF THE INTERNATIONAL BANK FOR RECONSTRUCTION AND DEVELOPMENT
AND THE INTERXATIONAL DEVELOPMENT ASSOCIATION
TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS
ON A PROPOSED LOAN AND DEVELOPMENT CREDIT
TO THE PEOPLE'S REPUBLIC OF CHINA
FOR A BEIJING ENVIRONMENTAL PROJECT
1.        The following memorandum and recommendation on a proposed loan for
US$45 million equivalent and a proposed development credit for SDR60.1
million (US$80 million equivalent) to the People's Republic China is
submitted for approval. The proposed loan would be for 20 years, including
five years of grace, at standard variable interest rate. The proposed credit
would be on standard IDA terms witl 35 years maturity and 10 years grace.
The loan and the credit would help finance an environmental project in
Beijing Municipality (BM). Proceeds of the loan and the credit would be
onlent through the BM to: (a) a district heating company for 15 years,
including five years of grace, at a variable rate equal to the Bank rate,
plus a spread of 1.5 percent p.a., with the district heating company bearing
the US dollar/ Renminbi Yuan foreign exchange risk; and (b) to industrial
enterprises for ten years, including three years of grace, at a variable rate
equal to the Bank rate, plus a spread of 1.5 percent p.a., with the
industrial enterprises bearing all foreign exchange risk; or a spread of 2.0
percent with the industrial enterprises bearing the US dollar/ Renminbi Yuan
foreign exchange risk. All other foreign exchange risk will be borne by BM.
2.        Background.  Growing urban populations and industrialization are
causing widespread air, water and soil pollution in China, and environmental
problems have become the highest priority issues in Chinese cities. Due to a
past industrial location policy, many large industries are placed close to
urban residential areas which are also rapidly expanding. Gaseous and poorly
treated liquid effluents, unwanted refuse from industries and domestic
premises, industrial hazardous and toxic wastes, and high noise levels from
congested traffic, factories and commercial complexes, are significantly
polluting the environment and affecting the health of urban residents.
3.        During the last decade China has initiated a wide array of
environmental protection policies and programs, and established comprehensive
pollution control guidelines. The National Environmental Protection Agency
(NEPA), established in 1979, is primarily responsible for setting national
policies, standards, and regulatory overview. Implementation and enforcement
are mainly the responsibility of the vast network of provincial, municipal
and local environmental protection bureaus. The Beijing Municipal
Environmental Protection Bureau (BMEPB) was established in 1979 with a
mandate to set local environmental regulations, enforce regulatory control,
coordinate integrated waste treatment, increbse public awareness, and operate
an environmental management system and monitoring network. BM has developed
initial strategies to address its air, water, and solid waste problems. They
involve changing of the fuel structure for domestic and industrial use,
improving wastewater and solid waste management, and greater efforts to
reduce industrial pollution. The plans for these have been reviewed by the
Bank. Beijing wishes to carry out studies, with the help of the Bank, to
refine these plans to ensure that they are cost-effective, and to resolve any
institutional constraints which could impede their implementation.



4.        hank's Previous Work and Lessons Learned.  The Bank Group is
involved in a number of projects in China's urban and water supply sectors
which deal to varying extent with the environment. Under implementation are
the Shanghai Sewerage Project, the Medium-sized Cities Development Project,
and the Liaoning Urban Infrastructure Project). The Shanghai Sewerage
Project (Credit 1779-CHA, SDR78.9 million, 1987; Loan 2794-CHA, US$45
million, 1987) is largely directed at environmental pollution control, and
the Bank/IDA's experience in it is highly relevant to the Beijing
Environmental Project. The other two projects are mainly concerned with
urban development and water supply, with only minor involvement in the
environmental area. Despite the complexity of the Shanghai Sewerage Project,
and the initial unfamiliarity of project officials with Bank requirements,
work progress is satisfactory, and construction quality exceptional. In
response to government requests for assistance in developing sound and cost
effective strategies for environmental improvement, the Bank has carried out
various sector studies which touch on environmental issues in China. In
particular a recent environmental strategy study for China (for publication
in grey cover this Fall), would identify major environmental issues and their
underlying causes, assess China's policies and institutional capabilities for
addressing them, recommend areas for improvement, and formulate a multi-year
program of environmental assistance.
5.        Rationale for Bank Involvement.  China has requested the help of
the international community in finding solutions to its environmental
problems. The World Bank is in a strong position to provide this assistance,
given its involvement in envirormental issues in previous projects in the
country. BM, which will be the beneficiary of this project, has already
established a strong institution for environmental protection with good
implementation capability.  It is highly committed to resolving its
environmental problems and has agreed to develop a long-term plan and to
implement an extensive program of investments and institutional improvements
to achieve this purpose. New technology, particularly for the industrial
pollution abatement, will be required, and this will need to be imported. BM
has played an important role for the past decade in providing NEPA with
technical support for developing environmental policies and testing pollution
control techniques for the country, and this role is seen to continue. The
experience gained from this project will allow Beijing to become an important
learning ground for many other cities in China which are encountering similar
problems. Bank assistance will help to ensure that these goals can be
achieved in the best possible way.
6.        Project Objectives.  The objectives of the project are to assist BM
to strengthen its environmental planning and management capabilities, and to
plan and carry out specific pollution abatement efforts. Project activities
would demonstrate: (a) cost-effective interventions in the areas of water,
air and hazardous and solid waste pollution; (b) improved investment
planning; (c) more effective measures for regulatory control; (d) basic
requirements for the efficient operation and maintenance of communal
facilities for pollution control and abatement; and (e) methods to recover
costs from the users of these facilities for sustained operation.
7.        Poect Descr5Rtion.  The project will assist through several
technical assistance and training components the Beijing Municipal Planning
Commission (BMPC), the Beijing Economic Commission, the BMEPB, the Beijing
Municipal Engineering Administration Bureau, the Beijing Environmental



-3 -
Sanitation Administration Bureau and the Beijing Public Utilities Bureau to
improve their capabi-'ity to develop and implement long term strategies for:
(a) air quality management; (b) water quality management; and (c) domestic
and solid waste management.  Environmental tudis to be conducted would
recommend an optimum program of investments to improve the environment at
least cost, and specific measures to strengthen institutional arrangements,
remove institutional constraints and improve inter-agency coordination. The
Government of China has rsceived a grarn: if US$1.6 million from the Japan
Grant Facility to cofinance these studies. A hazardous waste management
study will also be conducted to assess requirements, propose institutional
and regulatory needs, and to develop plans for hazardous waste disposal. An
autonomous sewerage company will be established to enable BM to better manage
the city's liquid wastes.
8.        Proposed physical works would include: (a) the construction of
sewer systems to collect wastewater in the southern urban area of the city
with a population of 2.4 million, and at the No. ? water plant area where the
groundwater provides drinking water supply to about one million people, for
appropriate treatment (a proposed Gaobeidian wastewater treatment plant is
now under construction); (b) the construction of a sanitary landfill and
procurement of equipment for solid waste disposal for about 20 percent of the
city's population; (c) in order to reduce air pollution from coal burning,
the construction of a pressurized hot water piping system for dist-;ict
heating from a heat and power cogeneration station to supply piped heat to
18.5 million m2 of residential building area for about 800,000 people; (d)
the procurement of equipment through a credit line to deal with solid, liquid
and gaseous pollutants discharged by industries; and (e) the construction of
buildings and procurement of equipment and instruments for the development of
an institution to manage the collection, treatment and safe disposal of
hazardous wastes.
9.        Project Implementatior.  Project implementation would be managed by
a project office under the BMEPB, which would oversee subproject offices in
the relevant construction and operating bureaus for wastewater, district
heating, and municipal solid waste works. Implementation of the industrial
pollution subprojects would be supervised by the BMPC with the assistance of
the China Investment Bank, Beijing Branch and experienced local consultants
engaged by BM. All the project offices have been established and staffed.
The project will be carried out over a period of five years. The total
project cost (excluding interest during construction) is estimated to be
US$298.7 million, with a foreign exchange component of US$126.0 million (42
percent). A breakdown of project costs and the financing plan are shown in
Schedule A. Retroactive financing of up to US$12.5 million for expenditures
incurred after March 1, 1991 will be provided. Amounts and methods of
procurement and of disbursements, and the disbursement schedule are shown in
Schedule B. A timetable of key project processing events and the status of
Bank Group operations in China are given in Schedules C and D, respectively.
A land use map (IBRD 23048) is also attached. The Staff Appraisal Report,
Report No. 9791-CHA, dated October 16, 1991, is being distributed separately.
10.       Agered Actlons.  BM has agreed to: (a) conduct the environmental
and hazirdous waste management studies; (b) onlend the proceeds of the
relevant parts of the loan/credit to the Beijing District Heating Company
(BDHC) and the industrial enterprises participating in the project on terms
and conditions acceptable to the Bank/IDA; (c) establish an autonomous



sewerage company with appropriate financial and operating policies acceptable
to the Bank/IDA; (d) carry out a staff training program; and (e) cause the
BDHC to generate, commencing January 1, 1993, sufficient revenues to cover
operating and maintenance costs, working capital increases and debt service,
and, commencing January 1, 1995, to cover at least 20 percent of its average
capital expenditures from its own resources.
11.       Benefits.  The project would support development and implementation
of cost effective long term environmental protection strategies and plans,
wh.ich by optimizing the use of the funds available would increase the size
and effectiveness of the environmental program. Heal`' benefits will accrue
from reduction of water-borne diseases, respiratory aL.Uents and cancer.
Corrosive damage to buildings and municipal water facilities caused by
pollution will be reduced. Constrained supplies of natural resources and raw
materials will be used more efficiently thereby improving economic
conditions. The project would also significantly strengthen the capability
of key institutions of the city in carrying out environmental planning and
pollution control work, as well as improve crucial coordination among t}em.
The composite IRR of thte wastewater and district project components,
comprising about 60 percent of the total project cost, is about 13 percent.
It is not possible to calculate a rate of return for the line of credit as
the subprojects to be financed are not yet fully evaluated.
12.       Risks.  There are risks of delay in implementation with a project
that has multiple components involving several different municipal entities,
none of whom were previously familiar with Bank procedures and requirements.
However, the establishment of a strong project management unit and its
effective management during project preparation, indicate that these risks
are manageable. With tne help of a comprehensive environmental plan,
concrete strategies and action plans to be developed in the projezt, and
proposed measures to strengthen the environmental management capabilities of
BM, efforts to continue environmental protection work at a high pace can be
expected to be sustained. Also the establishment of institutions for the
management of wastewater and hazardous waste as financially self-sustaining
entities, and the strengthening of the solid waste management institution,
will ensure that these important areas for environmental protection are well
taken care of.
13.       Recommendation.  I am satisfied that the proposed loan and credit
would comply with the Articles of Agreement of the Bank and the Association
and recommend that the Executive Directors approve the proposed loan and
credit.
