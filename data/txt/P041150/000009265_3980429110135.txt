I .                                  EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
The Village Infrastructure Project (VIP), is an agricultural sector programme initiated by the
M    n     Ministry of Food and Agriculture (MOFA) of the Republic of Ghana. The main objective
of the VIP will be poverty reduction among the rural population who are mainly dependent on
agricultural activities.
3          The Government of Ghana is seeking finance for the project from the International Development
Association (IDA, World Bank), International Fund for Agricultural Development (IFAD) and
!          Kreditanstalt fur Wiederaufbau (KfW). District Administrations and beneficiary communities are
also expected to make some financial contribution.
This Environmental Assessment has been made at the request of MOFA in order to meet World
|          Bank borrowing requirements and also to obtain the necessary approval of the Environmental
Protection Agency (EPA) of Ghana. The appropriate requirements of both organisations are
I          highlighted in the report. This project has been classified as Category B by the World Bank for
the purposes of environmental impact.
The report begins by presenting the background to the project within the context of the various
I          efforts made by the GoG since the launching of the Economic Recovery Programme (ERP) in
1983, to ensure that the gains of economic reforms reflect in improved living standards for all.
Out of a current estimated population of 18 million persons, nearly 68% (about 12 million) live
I I  -     in the rural areas where basic infrastructure such as roads, water and electricity are scarce. The
absence of these basic needs impacts adversely on all aspects of rural life including health,
|          education and income earning capacity.
I          Although there are current programmes like ASIP, CWSP and TRP initiated by Government and
I |          others by NGOs to address rural infrastructural requirements, the VIP is intended to be
|          implemented on small scale at village level to benefit the poorest of the poor.

VIP EA (EXECUTIVE SUMMARYJ
The VIP, which is expected to be implemented from 1997 to 2001, would have four main
components namely:
() Rural Water Infrastructure
(a) Rural Transport Infrastructure
(I Rural Post-Harvest Infrastructure
(1) Institutional Strengthening
The unique feature of the VIP is that the delivery of these components, in any selected area, will
be linked to ensure that the resulting synergy will multiply the intended benefits to achieve
sustainable development. The main beneficiaries of the VIP will be women, children and other
* I        vulnerable groups. The expected benefits include:
_                       Q Increased smallholder productivity and fann incomes
(:) Improved community welfare
i                       (M) Increased rural employment
i Better community health and nutritional status
I() Strengthened rural institutions
I1 1            The incidence of rural poverty occurs in all of the three main ecological zones of the country
3
l l ~~(savannah, forest and coastal zones) and in some ways, the level of poverty is influenced by the
environmental characteristics, particularly in the way they impact on agriculture. The report
-I g  <      therefore provides some baseline informnation describing the physical environment over the whole
country and covering specifics, like water resources (both surface and groundwater), geology,
soil types and climate. Data for these are presented in tabular form for easy reference.
I |    .   Since the project is aimed primarily at reducing rural poverty, the report elaborates on the socio-
economic aspects of rural life by providing extensive baseline information on factors such as
31 l ll    population, income levels, education, housing, health and existing infrastructure including
markets and roads.

I                                            VIP EA (EXECUTI VE SUMMARY)
The information for this section has been extracted from the results of the Ghana Living Standards
Survey (GLSS 1991/92) published in 1993. Available data is also presented in tables for ready
reference. This section also presents typical profiles of rural communities in the three ecological
zones and discusses the current status of women and children in rural communities.
The semi-arid savannah areas are the least populated and have some of the worst standards while
the forest zone with its rich agricultural areas tend to be relatively better off. The coastal areas
have benefited from proximity to the capital and major national road networks but yet still there
are significant pockets of deprivation and poverty especially in isolated areas.
The detailed sub-components of the VIP are presented in a summary description of the project.
The interventions proposed under water infrastructure include surface impoundments like ponds
and dugouts which will provide water for both the people and their livestock. A significant
development with these open water sources is the proposed use of attached infiltration wells for
human consumption and separate drinking troughs for the livestock. This should eliminate
problems of contamination which are prevalent with such systems. Groundwater, which is a major
source of potable water for the rural areas, will be provided mainly in the form of hand dug wells,
as boreholes tend to be expensive. The dependence on rain-fed farming will be reduced by the
development of small dams and streamfiow diversions, to provide for year-round irrigation and
promote intensification of farming activities to increase productivity and incotnes.
Rural transport infrastructure interventions will concentrate on rehabilitating existing feeder
roads to targeted connnunities and linking these with tracks and trails to the farns. Furthermore,
-       appropriate Intermediate Means of Transport (IMTs) will be provided to enable the farmers to
benefit from the improved roads by ensuring that they can transport their produce efficiently to
the markets.

Even at the present low levels of production, post-harvest losses (estimated at 30%), are a major
cause of low income earnings and its related problems of rural farming communities. The expected
intensification of agriculture through the water interventions, could compound the post-harvest
management problems. Another component of the VIP will therefore address this by providing
improved storage facilities both on-farm and at village level. These would be complemented with
appropriate crop processing equipment (grinding mills, digesters, extractors). Among the crops
targeted for processing are food grains (maize, rice, sorghum, millet), oil seeds (sheanut, oil palm,
3           groundnut, coconut), roots and tubers (yams, cassava), and vegetables and fruits (tomatoes,
plantains, bananas, pineapples). Fishing communities in the coastal areas would be provided with
3           improved technologies for drying and smoking of fish.
|           The small scale of the proposed interventions are such that, generally, any likely adverse
environmental impacts are expected to be localised. Nevertheless, a proliferation of localised
|           impacts could well result in a significant cumulative effect within a district, region or even across
the whole country.
At this stage of the VIP, no specific sites have been selected for implementation of the various
1           components and sub-components as proposed. With this in mind, the assessment of environmental
impacts, follows the lines of a Strategic Environmental Assessment. A close look is taken at each
I |         specific proposed intervention, highlighting the main potential adverse impacts that could arise
from its implementation, particularly within the rural context. This should serve to alert designers,
| I           implementers and other stakeholders to avoid major problems that could hinder sustainable
development.
Significant problems identified from field studies and consultations, including issues like selection
of sites for various projects, effective community involvement (from inception to take-over stage)
and the timing of implementation, could threaten the success of any of the components.

VIP E4 (EXECUTIVE SUMMARY)
E3          On the whole, the water projects are those likely to pose major significant problems such as
spread of disease (poor health affects all aspects of life including productivity), erosion, soil
degradation and loss of farm lands due to flooding, etc.
The main problem of roadworks is the issue of dust generation which is a residual problem for
most feeder roads as they will remain untarred for many years to come. With the IMTs, the
concerns raised were mainly those of their adaptability to the selected environments and the ability
of the beneficiaries to afford the required financial contributions.
Agro-processing raises issues of waste generation and waste disposal. The waste is typically
organic in character and could be a major source of pollution of water bodies. Improper waste
disposal also creates health hazards. Generally, waste disposal has become a problem nationwide
with the growing population, and developing the rural areas should not compound it. The other
aspect of agro-processing are the impacts identified with the use of diesel driven generators as
prime movers for the equipment. Among these are noise generation, smoke generation and health
and safety risks.
Storage facilities raise concerns of pesticide usage and this impacts on the overall proliferation of
chemical usage. With unskilled and untrained persons, this could be a major hazard.
The environmental concerns raised require that aspects of project design and implementation
should be environmentally sensitive. Guidelines are provided to facilitate the implementation of
the various VIP components. These would ensure that good environmental practices are adopted
to avoid and/or limit adverse consequences from the proposed interventions on the beneficiary
communities.
ii
Recommendations are provided for addressing those issues such as community involvement,
-j            community ownership, site selection and timing of construction activities which are relevant to
all components of the Project. Some of the recommendations for community involvement touch
on education, conflict resolution and maintenance.

Il          Site selection should avoid environmentally sensitive locations, cultural sites and allow adequate
area for future expansion where relevant. Tirning of construction, particularly for labour-based
projects should bear in mind the issue of seasonal migration out of some communities and cultural
I   .p      practices that may affect labour supply.
Under the water projects, guidelines are recornmended for water quality testing, control of disease
vectors and providing security for water sources. Mitigation measures that address reduction of
|           water resource capacity through evaporation, seepage and sedimentation are also provided.
Factors that could lead to land loss and soil degradation including erosion, waterlogging and
|           salinisation, and flooding are also addressed.
|           Guidelines are provided to address the impacts likely to arise under road rehabilitation and
construction of tracks and trails. Erosion, flooding and ponding problems are expected to be
addressed by good design and effective supervision during construction phase. Although dust
generation is seen to be residual with feeder roads, frequent watering and adoption of good work
-          practices could reduce the effect during construction. Recommended management of borrow pits
and quarries include filling, drainage and improving the landscape.
Recommendations are proposed for the handling of liquid and solid waste that are generated from
agro-processing. These include analysis and characterisation, effluent testing and effective
disposal. The concerns of health and safety raised in connection with the use of diesel driven
I |         generator for agro-processing are addressed by recommending training and implementation of
basic environmental, health and safety practices.
I
Measures for dealing with concerns of quality during storage include the use of air tight facilities
like mud silos. Protection against rodents and pest could be enhanced through fumigation, raising
| |           of platforms, use of pesticides and incorporation of rodent guards where practicable.

The report concludes by highlighting some of the benefits arising from the capacity building
component as an effective support for the Project to achieve long term sustainability. The Pilot
Integrated Catchment Management sub-component would train rural communities and related
-       agencies in efficient overall watershed management. The technical assistance and training
envisaged under  the transport and agro-processing components would ensure effective
maintenance of facilities provided.
I          Finally, the expected socio-economic impacts on the rural communities are discussed for the
various components of the VIP. Provision of rural water infrastructure will ensure the availability
of clean water which would impact positively on health. Good health would improve productivity
and income earning capacity, thereby contributing towards raising of rural living standards.
|          Women and children would be relieved from the drudgery associated with head porterage of
water over long distances, allowing them to engage in other more fulfilling activities.
Rehabilitating existing feeder roads and linking them with tracks and trails to the farms and
|           providing appropriate IMTs would improve the transport delivery system. This would result in
benefits such as enhanced access to markets for sale of farm produce, increasing their incomes.
I !         The improved roads would also facilitate movement of goods and services from urban to rural
areas, contributing further to the overall objective of the VIP.
Post-harvest management interventions including improved storage and processing will enhance
ii            the value of agricultural produce and reduce post-harvest losses. Certain items like shea butter
i  1    and cassava chips that are being increasingly exported should ensure even better earnings for the
farmers. Again, the increase earnings should lead to the overall improvement in the standard of
living in the rural communities.
ii 5          If the VIP is implemented with sound environmental practices appropriately guided, and proceeds
as intended, by ensuring the various component are adequately linked together in the selected
l |         communities, then the expected benefits could be achieved and sustained.

1.0 INTRODUCTION
1.1   Background
Ghana's population is currently estimated to be 18 million of which 68% (nearly 12 million)
live in the rural areas, where basic socio-economic infrastructure is not well developed. The
Economic Recovery Programme (ERP) which was launched in April 1983 with World Bank and
International Monetary Fund (IIIF) support, has been successful in bringing about some
significant macroeconomic reforms thereby generating moderate growth in the economy.
K          However the gains from these economic reforms have not led to any significant improvement in
rural living standards.
The introduction of the Programme of Actions to Mitigate the Social Cost of Adjustment
J          (PAMSCAD), initiated projects aimed at poverty reduction particularly among rural dwellers.
Recent studies (Participatory Poverty Assessment, PPA) indicate that nearly 54% of the poor are
rural dwellers whose livelihood depends solely on crop farming and other farm-based activities.
The recent launching of Vision 2020, which aims at making Ghana a middle income country by
the year 2020, requires that greater emphasis should be placed on improving rural living
conditions. Rural population dependency on agriculture implies that, any significant intervention
to reduce rural.poverty must be aimed directly at improving performance in the agricultural
3          sector through provision of appropriate infrastructure.
30         There are various ongoing government interventions to assist rural communities, such as the
Agricultural Sector Investment Project (ASIP), Community Water and Sanitation Project
3         (CWSP), Transport Rehabilitation Project (TRP), Northem Regional Pilot Infrastructure Scheme
(NRPIS) among others. In addition several NGOs are implementing similar projects in support
| |       of government's initiative.

VIP EA (INTRODUCTION)
The Village Infrastructure Project (VIP) is one of such interventions initiated by the Ministry of
Food and Agriculture (MOFA). The Project has the objective of supporting Ghana Government's
effort at reducing poverty and improving the standards of living of the rural poor. It is proposed
that the VIP will be implemented over five years spanning the period 1997 to 2001. The VIP
which is primarily aimed at developing basic, sustainable village-level infrastructure, will have four
main components, namely:
vI                (1) Rural Water Infrastructure
(0) Rural Transport Infrastructure
I  Rural Post-Harvest Infrastructure
4) Institutional Strengthening
The unique feature of the VIP is the way the components are expected to be linked in a
1           complementary manner so that the resulting'synergy will lead to sustained benefits for the targeted
1           rural comrnmunities.
a          The Project is expected to reduce rural poverty and increase agricultural output with specific
benefits such as:
6 Increased small holder productivity and farm incomes
3                 (X) Improved community welfare
: Strengthened rural institutions
I Better community health and nutritional status
(5) Increased rural employment
The main beneficiaries of this Project will be women, children and other vulnerable groups in
targeted rural savannah, forest and coastal areas.

VIP EA (NTRODUCTION)
1.2   World Bank Requirements for Environmental Assessment (EA)
n
The World Bank views EA as part of project decision making process and as a means to ensure
rl         that development options under consideration are environmentally sound and sustainable. In this
regard World Bank financed projects are subjected to environmental screening and classified into
categories A-D to determine the level of EA required, if any.
Category A covers most major projects which are likely to have significant environmental impacts
and require extensive EA to be carried out. Category B projects require limited EA as the
I          projects are either on small scale or have specific environmental impacts. Category C projects do
not require EA as they are unlikely to have significant environmental impacts. Category D
projects are environmental projects which do not require separate EAs as the environment itself
is a major focus of the project.
The World Bank requirements for Environmental Assessment are published in Operational
Directives (OD) 4.00, and its Annexes.
The VIP has been classified as Category B since the level of micro-scale, village-level activities
I          envisaged are insufficient and localised to warrant extensive EA of a Category A project.
3          1.3   Ghana Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) Requirements
The fundamental principle underlying Ghana's formal Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA)
Procedures is the preventive approach to environmental management in which EIA is applied as
a tool, especially at the project-specific level.
3 l        The EIA requirements published in the Ghana EIA Procedures are supported by law, the EPA
:1 Kl |Act, 1994 (Act 490). This Act mandates the Ghana EPA "to ensure compliance with laid down

ETA procedures in the planning and execution of development projects, including compliance in
respect of existing projects", Section 2 (I) of the Act. The basic objectives of the EIA system are
rD    to integrate environmental management and economic decisions at the earliest
stages of planning an undertaking, programme or investment and
(     to provide avenues for the involvement of the public, proponents, private and
3                        government agencies in the assessment and review of proposed undertakings,
among others.
The procedures provide for the registration of proposed developments with the EPA and
subsequent screening to determine the level of environmental assessment required for the
necessary project environment authorisation or otherwise. The VIP, at this stage, has not
identified specific sites for implementation of its various components and therefore cannot be
strictly assessed under the existing Ghana EIA procedures. A more general approach
incorporating an overall assessment of the programme is therefore indicated.
1.4   Scope of Environmental Assessment
In the light of the foregoing requirements, this study is in the form of a Strategic Environrnental
I |         Assessment (SEA) based on the scope and format agreed to by the Proponent (MOFA), World
Bank and Ghana EPA. As proposed, this SEA establishes relevant general baseline conditions,
identifies potential environmental concerns and provides appropriate environmental guidelines for
I
the implementation stage of the Project. Since the project is primarily aimed at reducing rural
poverty and improving standards of living of the rural poor, the study elaborates on the socio-
economic aspects of rural communities. Relevant baseline information on key measurable socio-
I l         economic indicators are presented in sufficient detail as a guide to site selection and also to
facilitate eventual monitoring, evaluation and auditing as the VIP implementation advances.

2.0 GENERAL BASELINE INFORMATION
2.1   Water Resources
XW7ater is fundamental to life and essential for nearly every human endeavour. Water
resources have to be developed to provide for human consumption, agriculture (crop
production, livestock, fisheries) and industrial applications (power generation, processing).
I
In general, water supply development in Ghana is influenced by an abundance of surface water
and low occurrence of ground water. Surface water is being used to supply potable water to
population centres (above 10,000 people), provide hydro-power and for irrigation among others.
3           Ground water is used mainly to provide potable water in low population areas and areas where
surface water is inadequate.
2a1.1  Surface Water
The main river basins in Ghana which constitute the available surface water sources are the White
Volta, Black Volta, Oti, Lower Volta, Pra, Ankobra, Tano, Bia, Coastal Drainage (mainly Ayensu
3           and Densu) and Tordzie/Aka Basins (Fig 2.1). The distribution of these basins are summarised
in Table 2.1 overleaf.
Rain water harvesting also serves as a source of surface water available to many rural
| 3         conimunities. The mean annual rainfall varies from 2,250 mm in the west coastal area, to about
750 mm in the eastern coastal area (around the capital, Accra), and 100 mm in the North. This
| 5         indicates that the South Western part of the country is well watered unlike the semi-arid savannas
to the North and the Central and Eastern coastal plains. The variability and uneven distribution
|           of rainfall results in water deficit in some parts of the country during the year. Investigations
reveal that though surface water quality is generally good, local pollution however exits
particularly in the mining localities and areas of intensive agricultural activities.

2.1.2 Groundwater
Aquifers underlie almost all areas in the country. Occurrence of ground water however, is
controlled principally by the local geology and other factors such as topography and climate. In
northern Ghana aquifers have been located at between 10 m and 60 m depth with an average of
27 m. In southern Ghana, due to thicker soil cover, boreholes are deeper, ranging between 25 m
and 80 m depth with an average of 42 m (Bannerman, 1986).
Borehole yields vary between 10 I/min to 600 I/min with over 60% ranging between 10 1 /min to
50 l/min. The average depth, location of aquifers, yields, transmissivities and hydraulic
conductivities in the various geological formations are given in Table 2.2. Attached as Figure 2
i! I         is a borehole yield map of the country.
I,1 |        The number and distribution of boreholes in Ghana as at 1993 is also shown in Table 2.3.
In terms of quality, investigations indicate that ground water supplies are generally suitable for
5          most domestic and industrial purposes. However there are some areas with occurrence of high
concentrations of manganese, iron, salinity and total hardness.

The geological foundation of Ghana (Figure 2.2) comprises the following rock formations:
I)    Basic intrusive ana granitic pre-cambrian formations occurring in an outer rim around
|I                      the centre.
ii)    A Pre-Cambrian Dahomeyan system of massive crystalline granulites, gneisses, schists
and sedimentary remnants in the south eastern plains.
iii)   The Pre-Cambrian Birrimian system of argillaceous sedirnents, volcanic and calcareous
I                     materials which are metamorphosed and folded granitised or intruded by granites.
1              :x\iv)    The restricted Tarkwain sandstones, phyllites and conglomerates.
1              v)    The Buem formation of shales, sandstones, volcanic, limestones, tillite and grit.
1
vi)    The Palaeozoic Voltain formation of shales, mudstones, sandstones, conglomerate,
5                     tillite and limestone.
|              vii)   The Devonian Sekondian and Accrain marine sandstones and shales in small areas
along the coast.
viii)   The Cretaceous-Eocene sands, clays and limestones at the eastern and western
extremities of the coast.
|              ix)    The Upper Tertiary red, limonitic sandy pebbly clay overlying the Lower Tertiary
materials near the coast.

x)    Recent and unconsolidated material occurring along the coast.
ix)   Drift and iron pan cappings dispersed widely in all environments.
ii.
The geology has considerable influence on the relief and the soils. The land is generally below 600
m. The lowest lying areas occur in the middle Volta Basin and in a broad belt along the coast. The
broad physiographic regions of the land include: the coastal plains, the Buem-Togo ranges, the
|          forest Dissected Plateau, the Southern Voltaian Plateaux, the Savannah High plains and the
Gambaga Escarpment
2.3       Soils
The major soils of Ghana are indicated in Fig. 2.3 These soils include:
I)    The Oxysols (Oxisols: USDA; Ferric, Plinthic Aerisols: FAO).
j           These are developed under evergreen rain forest with rainfall above 1778mm. They are strongly
leached soils with predominant kaolinitic clays and deficient humus content. The oxysols are
|           strongly susceptible to erosion on exposure and to rapid nutrient depletion. These soils occur
around the extreme south west corner of Ghana.
I
ii)    The Ochrosols (Ultisols, USDA; Rhodic Ferralsol: FAO).
The ochrosols are developed in both forest and savanna environment under rainfalls between
|i          900mm and 1650mm. The savannah ochrosols occur in the northern and coastal savannahs in the
middle range of the rainfall limits and under a single maximum rainfall in the northern savannahs.
3           The profile may contain iron pan or gravel at depths which are shallower in the savanna areas. The
organic matter content is low especially in the savanna soils and are draughty in the surface
horizons. The ochrosols are extremely important agriculturally. They are widely cultivated in both
I  n                           .~~~~~~~~~~~~~~1



VIP EA (BASELINE)
I
forest and savanna areas. Like many other soils, however, their nutrient-vegetation relationships
are fragile and they are susceptible to water erosion.
iii)   The ground water laterite (Inceptisols: USDA; Plinthic Ferrasol: FAO)
The ground water laterite profile consists of a few cm to 61 centimetres of sandy or silty loam
over iron pan or undulating mottled clay in upland locations. They are concretionary to the
surface where the surface material is disturbed. These are said to be the poorest soils in humid
tropical Africa with low nutrient status. They are draughty, mostly unfarmed over the granites
where they may be degraded through erosion.
iv)    The Tropical Black Earths (Vertisols: USDA; Pellic Vertisols, FAO).
These are the dark grey cracking clays in the northern and coastal savanna areas under rainfalls
of between 1000 mm and 1270 mm. The black earths occur in low topographic positions. They
are extremely heavy textured and cannot be effectively cultivated with traditional implements.
Their nutrient status is generally good though nitrogen and phosphorus may be lacking. Their
patchy occurrence in the northern savannas and frequent presence of rock outcrops over the
|           granites makes it difficult to develop them on an extensive scale. They are less subject to
erosional or nutrient degradation because of their topographic position.
v) The tropical Grey Earths (Alfisols: USDA; Gleyic solenetz: FAO).
1-
These are grey hard pan soils in gentle savanna topography over acid rocks. They occur mainly
on the Accra-Ho-Keta plains under rainfalls between 600mm and 900mm. The profile is
characterized by the occurrences of a hard compact sandy clay pan a few centimetres below the
|           surface. These are very little used soils. They have low organic matter, nitrogen and phosphorus
status.

l
They become water logged in the rainy season but draughty in the dry season.
j                  Susceptibility to water erosion and high sodium content in the lower horizons present
problems in use.
I
vi)    Other Soils
I
The other major soils of Ghana comprise the intergrades of the above soils and their lower
|                  topographic associates: the acid gleisols (Gleysols: USDA; Dystrio gleysols (FAO) in
various a}luvial and terrace material, the lithosols on steep slopes (Entisols: USDA, FAO),
the regosols (Entisols: USDA; Rhegosols: FAO) on coastal sands and estuarine fills and
the sodium vleisols (inceptisols, USDA; Gleyic solonchacks: FAO) in marginal lagoonal
environments.
1                  2.4    Climate
I                  The climate in Ghana is tropical. Southern Ghana is humid whilst northern Ghana which
I                  falls partly in the sahelian zone is relatively dry. During the harmattan season the northern
savannah area becomes extremely dry with relative humidity as low as 25% or less in
1                  January. Average temperatures vary from about 240 C in the south to around 3 6 C in the
north.
I
In Ghana the mean annual rainfall varies from 2250 millimetres in the West Coastal area
to about 750 millimetres in the eastern coastal area and 100 millimetres in the North. The
rainfall distribution during the year follows four main patterns. These are:
I<
(D    Single rainy  season increasing from  March with the peak in
1                               August/September. This occurs in the northern savannah areas typified by
Tamale and Navrongo.

1                 2.5   Measurable Socio-Economic Indicators of Rural Communities
The following information on the current socio-economic conditions of the rural
communities in Ghana are provided as a baseline to form the basis for benchmarking and
future monitoring and evaluation.
2.5.1  Population
The current estimated population of Ghana is about 18 million of which nearly 68% live
|                 in the rural areas. Population trends from analysis of census data from 1960, 1970 and
1984 indicate a progressive increase of rural to urban migration from 23% to 32%.
However, data gathered from the Ghana Living Standards Survey (GLSS 1991/92) point
to gradual reversal of this trend.

VIP EA (BASELINE)
The absence of social amenities like schools, water, electricity, roads, hospitals,
entertainment spots, post offices and banks have contributed to the depressed conditions
in the rural areas. This has resulted in a situation where many young men of employable
U       a g age drift to the urban areas. The bulk of rural dwellers are therefore women, children and
the elderly. The same conditions do not make it attractive enough for teachers, health
|  -             workers and other professionals to move to and/or work in the rural areas.
1                2.5.2  Income Levels
Table 2.4 gives a profile of rural income levels. Out of the 62.3% percentage share of
total income, Rural Forest Zone eamed 30%, Rural Savanna earned 18.1% and Rural
I                Coastal earned 14.2%. The high income from Forest Zone is probably due to the extensive
cash crop farming within this agro ecological zone. The mean annual per capita income
of ¢108,000, ¢109,000 and ¢84,000 for the Coastal, Forest, and Savanna zones,
I                respectively, reflect very low income levels in relation to the cost of living.
2.5.3  Education
I                Educational facilities are generally available countrywide. About 87% of rural households
live in communities with a primary school, while 64% live in areas with a middle school
1                 and 11% live in cormrmunities with senior secondary or technical schools. (GLSS Rural
Communities in Ghana, 1993). Table 2.5 gives a breakdown of educational background
of Ghanaian households by level of education attained.

2. 5.4 Housing
I
Housing is one of the basic needs that every individual requires. Rural housing types vary
slightly among the three ecological zones. Houses in the rural savanna are built of mud
with thatch roofing. The forest and southern parts of the rural savanna utilise sticks and
mud, with corrugated iron sheets for roofing. Within the coastal zone rural houses are
built of mud bricks with sandcrete plastering.
The average number of persons per household varies from a high of 5.45 in the rural
savanna areas to 4.36 and 4.00 in the rural forest and rural coastal areas respectively.
Housing in the rural areas generally lack built-in amenities such as electricity, toilet
facilities and water. Table 2.6 gives the indicators of household densities for different
localities:
2.5.5  Health
Rural community dwellers are exposed to a host of health problems related directly to
inadequate water (quality and quantity) and lack of proper sanitary provisions. These
problems are compounded by absence of basic health infrastructure and health education.
Some of the common diseases are malaria, guinea worm, kwashiorkor, cholera and
diarrhoea.  Table 2.7 shows the major health problems facing household in rural
communities by ecological zones.

2.5.6  Employable Skills
r
Opportunities for formal employment are generally not available in the rural communities.
Skills commonly found among rural dwellers are blacksmithing, masonry, carpentry, dress
making, chain saw operation and driving. Other skills that are becoming common in rural
communities are the operation, repair and maintenance of food processing machines like
corn mills, oil extractors, cassava processing machines. There are some notable
variations in the employable skills found within various ecological zones. In the coastal
zone for example, there are larger numbers of people with variety of employable skills
because of proximity to large urban centres. In the forest zones chainsaw operators are
quite common, while in the northern savanna zone, blacksmiths tend to be more common.
2.5.7 Ecisting Infrastructure
The availability of the following forms of rural infrastructure are considered below.
(i) Markets
(0) Roads and Transportation and
(I Potable Water
Markets: In the Coastal and Forest Zones, 25% and 30% of households live in areas
that have a permanent market. Periodic markets are more prevalent in the rural savanna
areas as shown in Table 2.8 which gives data on the availability of markets to rural
communities.
Roads and Transport: Generally, the rural coastal and rural forest zones have more
accessible roads close by the communities. Large areas of the rural savanna zone
(comprising Upper East and West, and Northern Regions) are least accessible in terms of
motorable roads. The availability of public transport is linked to available motorable roads
as depicted in Table 2.9.

Potable Water: Potable water resources are not widely developed in most rural
communities. During the dry season water becomes relatively scarce; communities in the
fl                various ecological zones have to resort to variety of sources for potable water as shown
in Table 2.10.
2.5.8 Agro-Processing
Food processing is a major preoccupation of rural inhabitants, particularly women. The
main activities in agricultural processing are:
I                        6) Processing maize into flour
(ED Preparation of Gari
(I) Processing Cassava into flour
A), Processing flour from various grains
) Processing shelled ground nuts and rice
Table 2.11 shows the distribution of household agro-processing activities with emphasis
;                 on the role of women.

2.6   Profiles of Rural Communities
In order to provide a more rounded picture of rural communities in Ghana, this section
which highlights the socio-economic profiles of three selected rural communities, (one
from each of the three ecological zones) has largely been extracted from the GLSS
1991192. (Report of a National Rural Community Survey) . These profiles provide a
summary of each community's characteristics as reported in the survey.
I
2.6.1 Profile of a Coastal Rural Community
Education - The households in the cormnunity have access to one public primary co-
-                 educational school. Built 30 year ago, the school runs from classes 1 to 6. However less
than half the children of primary school age are actually enrolled. This situation could be
attributed to the inability of parents to fund children's education, child delinquency, and
i                 lack of adequate materials for the school children-
There is no middle or junior secondary school in the community. The nearest junior
secondary school is some four miles away. This school, established in 1987, is also a
public and co-educational school which has all the three classes required at the junior
secondary level. It is estimated that less than half the children of junior or middle school
age are enrolled.
There is also no secondary or technical school in the community. The nearest one is
about six miles away. Built in 1976, the school admits only boys and has up to four
s It              classes. Attendance here, is also not encouraging with less than half of the boys of
secondary school age in regular attendance.

The most serious schooling problems are the lack of adequate school buildings, and the
lack of furniture. In a bid to improve the educational status of the adult population, an
adult literacy programme was launched in 1990, which is yet to be patronised.
Health - There are no health facilities like hospital, dispensary, pharmacy, maternity
home, clinic or health post, nor is there a family planning clinic in the community.
Similarly there are no health personnel like a doctor, nurse, pharmacist, trained midwife,
family planning worker or community health worker. Households living in the community
need to travel a distance of about six miles to get to the nearest health facility or
personnel, with the exception of a traditional birth attendant and a traditional healer who
are available in the conmmunity.
The major health problems in order of importance and prevalence are, cholera, skin
diseases, malaria, and waist pains in that order. Most of the women in the community
give birth at home. Households in the community have had at least one exposure to both
immunization and anti-malaria campaigns during the last five years.
Infrastructure - Even though there is a motorable road passing by the community, this
road is impassable for about half of the year. There is therefore no regular public
transport passing by the community, and households have to travel a distance of about
four miles to catch public transport.
Access to pipe-borne water and electricity in the home is limited to a few households in
the community. However, there is a public tap which serves the needs of most households
in the community during both the rainy and the dry season.
Households in the community do not have access to any post office, public telephone, or
bank within the commnunity. They need to travel a distance of about four miles to get to
the nearest urban centre where these facilities exist.

The community is currently undertaking certain development projects which include the
construction of school buildings, provision electricity, and the maintenance of the road
network within the community.
Agriculture - The major crops grown in this community are maize, cassava, cashew nut,
water melon, tomatoes, pepper, coconut, garden eggs, and sugar cane. Most of these
crops are marketed through private transporters who transport them to nearby towns for
|                 sale.  Sometimes, however, the women in the community transport the produce
themselves to other marketing centres in the cities and towns.
There is no agricultural extension centre in the community, (the nearest one is about six
miles away) but there is an extension officer from the Ministry of Agriculture (Crop
Services Division) living in the comnunity who visits each farmer about four times a year.
Some of the services provided by this officer include teaching the best methods of planting
and fertilizer application. Some of the farmers have also learnt to use insecticides and
herbicides of their farms.
As far as land tenure is concerned, land is not sold in this comrnunity and sharecropping
|                 is not practised by any of the farmers. There is, however, a system of mutual assistance
for farmwork which is practised by some farmers in the community.
Economic and Other Social Conditions - The majority of the community members are
i34 |                farmers and civil servants. Their impression is that conditions of life in 1992 are worse
than as they were about 10 years back. This is attributed to the high cost of living, job
ji |                 retrenchment, lack of adequate rainfall and increase in population leading to pressure on
food and social amenities like shelter.

Some of the household members in the community leave temporarily at certain times of
fl              the year to look for jobs elsewhere. Some of them find work such as carpentry and
masonry in Accra and Kumasi. These people are usually between the ages of 20 and 35.
rl -             There is no movement of people from other areas into the community to look for
temporaryjobs. However, over the period 1981 to 1991 they have had net emigration.

Education - Households in the community have access to three public coeducational
primary schools. Each has class one to six. Almost all the children of primary school age
are enrolled. There is also a public co-educational middle/junior secondary school in the
community which has three classes. Again almost all the children of junior secondary
school age are enrolled.
I                The community also has a senior secondary/technical school. Built in 1978, it is a private
co-educational institution with three classes. Only a few of the children of secondary
school age attend the school. The most serious schooling problems facing the community
in order of importance are, lack of school building, furniture, textbooks, stationery and
qualified teachers.
An adult literacy programme was launched in the community in 1991 and has an
enrollment of about 120, made up of 52 men and 68 women.
Health - The comnmunity has a dispensary, maternity home and a family planning clinic,
fi §               as well as a traditional birth attendant and a traditional healer. Households have to about
five miles to get to a hospital or pharmacy. Most women in the community give birth at
|                the maternity home.

The major health problems in the community in order of importance and prevalence are,
rl                measles, eye diseases and ringworm in that order. Apparently there had not been any anti-
malaria campaign in the community within the last five years, but there had been an
fl -          immunization campaign. Health services and other related problems in the community
include the absence of a clinic, inadequate provision of places of convenience, and lack
|                 of good drinking water.
I                 Infrastructure - There is a motorable road that passes by the community. There is also
a rough road that goes to it, but this is impassable for about eight months during the year.
X                None of the households in the community has access to electricity or pipe-borne water.
Rivers, springs and rainwater are the main sources of drinking water during the rainy
I                 season, and wells without pumps are the main source in the dry season.
I.                There is a post office and a bank in the community but no public telephone. The nearest
public phone is about five miles away. Among the ongoing development projects are an
electrification programme, the construction of a KVIP place of convenience and the
1=                building of a market. The community has a permanent daily market.
3                 Agriculture - The major crops grown in the community in order of importance are
plantain, cocoa, tomato, maize, cassava, and cocoyam. All these crops are planted and
harvested once or twice during the year. With the exception of the tomato and cocoa,
all the other crops are sold at the local market. The tomato is transported for sale at the
nearest town while the cocoa is sold to authorised cocoa receivers.
There is no agricultural extension centre but an agent from the Ministry of Agriculture
visits each farmer about three times a year. The nearest centre is about five miles away.
There are no tractors, or cassava grating machine in the community, but there is a rice-
husking machine. Farmers in the community do make use of insecticides or herbicides and
chemical fertiliser. The practice of irrigation is, however, uncommon. Land can be sold

in this community. Sharecropping is practised by the farmers. Furthermore, farmers
rl                engage agricultural labourers and do not practise the system of mutual assistance among
farmers for farmwork.
Economic and Other Social Conditions - The major occupations of households in the
|                 community are farming, trading, and distilling of local gin (akpetshie). The impression of
the leaders in the community is that life in the community now (1992) is worse in
|                 comparison with life in 1982. This situation is attributed to the high cost of living, lack of
jobs, and lack of adequate social and economnic infrastructure.
There is no temporary movement of household members out of the community to seek
a                 seasonal work elsewhere. However, there are people from the Upper East and Volta
regions who move into the community to look for temporary work as farmhands. These
people, aged between 18 and 35 years, usually stay for about three months.
1                 2. 6.3  Profile of A Savannah Rural Commznity
Education - Households in the community have access to one public coeducational
primary school. Built in 1985, the school has classes one to six. The proportion of
children of school going age enrolled is about half for boys and less than half for girls.
I                 This could be attributed to the inability of parents to fund children's education, lack of
parental interest in the education of their children and the use of children as baby sitters
|1                for their younger siblings or to care for aged parents or grandparents. There is no middle
or junior secondary school in the community. The nearest one is located about three miles

the proportion of children who attend is less than half The nearest senior secondary
5                 school, which is also a public coeducational institution, is about three miles away form the

survey. Only a few of the children of secondary school age attend the school.

The most serious schooling problemn, are lack of school building, furniture, textbooks and
qualified teachers. An adult literacy programme was launched in the community in 1991.
It had an enrollment of about 25 members in the class made up of 15 men and 10 women.
Health - The community has both a health post and a famnily planning clinic. To get to
|l -              a hospital, dispensary, pharmacy or maternity home, households have to travel about 50
miles. Most women in the community give birth at home. The major health problems in
the community in order of importance, are measles, malaria, diarrhoea, and waist pains
in that order. Apparently there had not been any anti-malaria campaign in the community
X                 within the last five, but there had been an immunization campaign.
X                 With reference to problems with health services, the high fares and lack of transport to
the nearest health facility or personnel, high medical bills, and lack of drugs at the only
health post in the community are the most important ones.
i                 Infrastructure - The nearest motorable road is about three miles away, so no public
a                 transport passes by the community. There is a rough road that also comes to the
community but this is impassable for about three months during the year.
None of the households in the community has access to electricity or pipe-borne water.
The main sources of drinking water during both the rainy and dry season are rivers, lakes,
springs and rainwater. There is no post office, public telephone or bank in the community.
The nearest post office is about 25 miles away, whilst households would need to travel
a distance of over 50 miles to get to a public phone or bank. The community does not
have any market of its own, either daily or periodic.
Agriculture - The major crops grown in the community in order of importance are millet,
maize, groundnuts, beans, rice and vegetables. All these crops are planted and harvested
once during the year and are transported for sale at the nearest two about three miles

comes from this centre to visit farmers in this community. There are no tractors, cassava
'l -             grating or rice husking machines in the community. Farmers in the community also do not
use insecticides or herbicides nor do they practise irrigation. The application of chemical
|                fertilizer is, however, common. In this community land cannot be sold and sharecropping
is not practised by the farmers. Furthermore, no farmer engages agricultural labourers to
I                assist with farm work; instead, there is a system of mutual assistance among farmers.
I                Economic and Other Social Conditions - The major occupations of households in the
community are farming, picking of sheanuts and trading. The impression of the leaders
is that life in the community now (1992) is worse in comparison with life in 1981. This
is attributed to poor yield from farms, lack of drinking water, and an upsurge of attacks
from certain diseases, especially boils. However, as far as employment is concerned, it
I                is easier finding work in the community now (1992) than it was in 1981.
I                Household members within the working age group do leave the community temporarily
for seasonal work in other towns and cities like Kumasi, Ejura, Atebubu, Yendi and
I                Bimbila. They are normally away for about three months and are usually engaged as farm
labourers. There are no similar temporary migrants coming into the community to take

2.7   General Socio-Economic Status of Women and Children
Women and children bear the major burden of rural poverty. Nearly 50% of the total
rural population are below age fifteen. The data on total fertility rate also shows that rural
women have an average of 6.4 children as compared to an average of 4 children for urban
|                women. The consumption needs of households with many dependent children are high in
relation to their resources which are often limnited. These rural households therefore tend
I                to be more impoverished.
Due to limited resources, women are unable to meet the obligation to send each child to
school. Older children are often deprived from going to school in order that they may care
_                for their younger siblings. The direct effect is that most girls of ages 15 years and above
become school drop-outs. The possible vicious cycle of poverty then begins with the
teenage child becoming pregnant, having too many children, and finally having no
I                education or skills to create a livelihood for the family. Young girls are often sent to urban
centres to be employed as housemaids in order to assist the rural family financially. These
young girls are vulnerable, and are often subjected to all forms of abuses.
I                Income levels of women in the rural communities are generally low, and most of them
have little or no education. These conditions reflect on the values that are passed on to the
I |             children. The present low level of infrastructure impacts negatively on the status of
women and children in rural communities. Some of the effects being the drudgery
X 5             associated with head porterage of water, farm produce and firewood over long distances
and poor health among others.
11'
The positive aspect of women's status in rural communities is the fact that they are
I               involved in a vital aspect of the economy - food growing and processing.

VIP EA (PROJECT DESCRIPTION)
3.0 SUMMARY OF PROJECT DESCRIPTION
r
3.1   Rural Water Infrastructure
T7his component covers the development of water resources for both agriculture and
.              1 household consumption. They include dugouts (with adjoining facilities for drinking
water), and small-scale irrigation development through streamflow diversion, pumping and
|                run-off management to increase yields of rain-fed crops. The following are the sub-
|                components:
3.1.1  Ponds, Dugouts, and OtherSurfaceImpoundments
The topography of most of the dry savannah region does not allow for efficient surface
water storage. Although dugouts, ponds and other small water reservoirs may have
i                relatively large water surface and shallow depths, they remain the main option for water
supply in many areas of the North. Dugouts will be complemented with separate
3                abstraction points for human consumption and drinking troughs for animals. Under the
VIP about 95 dugouts and other small surface impoundments would be constructed
and/or rehabilitated.
3.1.2  Boreholes, Hand-dug Wells and Spring Development
rI                Shallow ground water is found in very limited areas and may be tapped by relatively
Il                 inexpensive means such as washbores and hand-dug wells. The project would support the
5 |              development of about 150 such facilities. In addition, the project would develop 30 spring
I                  water facilities in appropriate farming areas.

3.1.3 Streamflow Diversions and Pumping
The project would support the development of small-scale irrigation from streamflow
I  .       diversions and pumping.. All together about 285 hectares operated by about 250 farm
farmers will be catered for mainly along the shore line of the Volta Lake and other
|                 perennial streams in the transitional and forest zones.
1                 3.1.4  Run-off Management
ffi               The project would provide for the establishment of basic water retaining infrastructure
such as terraces, banks, bunds and other flow controlling structures and devices to manage
the runoff and increase infiltration efficiency. This is to harness the irregular but normally
high intensity rains in the northern and middle belt to support rice and other grain crops.
Under the AVIP nearly 1,850 hectares would be developed to benefit about 900 farm
I                 families.
1                 3.1.5  PilotIntegratedCatchmentManagement
As part of the institutional strengthening envisaged under the VIP, the rural communities
would be empowered through the Pilot Integrated Catchment Management Scheme to
acquire basic skills for efficient management of water resources.
3.2   Rural Transport Infrastructure
|1                The Project would provide for the rehabilitation of feeder roads, construction and
upgrading of village arterial tracks and trails and promotion of the use of Intermediate
I                 Means of Transports (IMTs). The implementation of the sub-coniponents would be to
maximise synergy in the provision of the transport facilities. The relevant sub-components
l   l             are:

3.2.1 Feeder Roads Rehabilitation
The Project would support the rehabilitation of about 750 km of key feeder roads, and
I        ~       spot improvements of about 1,050 km, including provision of culverts and appropriate
drainage. The Department of Feeder Roads (DFR) would work with the District
|  -             Assemblies and in consultation with MOFA to agree on the priority target feeder roads
to be rehabilitated and the timning for linking them with the tracks and trials to be
I                improved.
I                The feeder roads would be no more than 6 metres wide and follow the DFR recommended
specifications. Labour from beneficiary villages would be employed, and a strong
I                emphasis would be placed on maximizing the employment of women.
3                3.2.2 'Village Traeks and Trials
-                The project would develop an estimated 270 km of priority village-to-farm tracks and
3                trails (VTTs) which would be identified by beneficiary communities. The tracks would
have standard width of 2.5 metre and shallow side ditches. The construction would be
implemented by labour based contractors who would use labour from beneficiary villages.
3.2.3  Improvement in Intermediate Means of Transport (IMTs)
Improvement of tracks and trails linking farms to villages will be conditional on the
communities wishing to improve the efficiency of transporting materials to the farms and
their produce to the villages and onwards to the markets outside the villages. The Project
would make provision for the promotion of three forms of NIMTs. These are mainly,
I |              cycle trailers, donkey-carts and light trailers drawn by power units of small garden tillers.
Its is envisaged that purchases of donkey carts and light transport trailers powered by
I               garden tillers would be made by farmers' associations rather than by individuals.

3.3    Rural Post-harvest Infrastructure
fl        ~       The Project would provide various interventions for post-harvest management. These
would include on-farm and village-level facilities for drying, storage and appropriate level
|  -              processing. The sub-components are:
1                 3.3.1  Village-Level Drying and Processing Facilities
I                 Provision will be made for the construction and/or rehabilitation of small to medium size
post-harvest facilities such as drying floors and platforms, cribs, crop processing and fish
smoking units for use by identified groups in beneficiary communities.
I                 These interventions are applicable throughout the country but are particularly needed in
the high rainfall zone of the south-west and east where improper drying and storage of ten
lead to high level of losses. They would enable crop and livestock smallholders and fish
processors to produce higher quantity and quality crop and animal products. Some cash
crops such as cocoa beans and cassava chips, would be exported through private buying
agents. The range of crops targeted for processing include food grains (maize, rice,
sorghumn, millet), oils and seeds (sheanut, groundnut, oil palm, coconut), roots and tubers
(cassava and yams), and vegetables and fruits (tomatoes, plantains, bananas and
pineapples). Among the equipment to be procured are grinding mills, digesters, extractors
and presses and other miscellaneous equipment.
Fishing villages would also benefit from this component through the provision of
improved technologies for fish smoking and drying with emphasis on the "Chorkor" fish
|                 smoking technique.

VWP EA (ENVIRONMENTAL CONCERNS)
4.0 MAIN POTENTIAL ENVIRONMENTAL CONCERNS
This section deals with the main potential environmental concerns likely to arise from the
[                various project interventions proposed under the Village Infrastructure Project. Though
the Project is aimed at improving the standards of living of the rural poor, its
-             implementation must be designed to be environmentally sensitive so as to avoid any
undesirable adverse consequences of the given intervention. For example, providing
Nl                dugouts and village tracks and trails could create problems of erosion and water
contamination.
Although most of the project impacts would be localised due to the relatively small scale,
3                 there are some issues of concern which cut across the range of proposed interventions.
Field studies and lessons from similar programmes show that issues such as community
invohzement, community ownership and selection of appropriate sites are some of the key
concerns which influence project success and sustainability.
These general and localised issues of concern are discussed below.
3                 4.1    Rural Water Infrastructure
3                 4.1.1  Ponds, Dugouts, and Other Surface Impoundments. - 95 Facilities
I                 These are surface (open) water sources exposed to the elements and raise the following
concerns:
I'
Water Quality/Risk of Contamination - Exposed water bodies are prone to
3 |                      contamination from human related activities like waste disposal, indiscriminate
defaecation and contact by disease hosts (e.g. Guinea worm). Faecal matter from
ji |animal sources and other contents of run-off could introduce rnicrobiallbiological
37



VIP EA (ENVIRONMENTAL CONCERNS)
agents which would spread pathogens and cause diseases (e.g. diarrhoea,
dysentery and cholera).
r                 .       IHabitat for Disease Vectors - Inpoundments provide suitable habitats for certain
disease vectors to multiply and spread. Common examples are:
- snail vectors: schistosomiasis (bilharzia)
- mosquito vectors : malaria and filariasis
Security - In the absence of formal security arrangements, open water bodies have
unrestricted access. This poses several problems such as:
- risk of drowning by children and other vulnerable persons
- misuse by animals
- abuse by unscrupulous persons
|  *  Evaporation and Seepage - With relatively large surface areas and shallow
depths, these water sources are liable to losses through evaporation. This could
be very significant during the dry harmattan period (December to March)
particularly in the northern savannah regions. Seepage losses may occur either
I                       laterally through the walls of the impoundment and/or downwards depending on
the permeability of the sub-soil.
l
*     Sedimentation/Siltation - Run-off laden with soil and other material will
I |                     discharge into open water sources and deposit. The rate of siltation will depend
upon the nature and extent of activities within the general catchment particularly
* |                     on the up-side of the impoundment.(e.g. intensive farming utilising fertilizer and
pesticides). Progressive sedimentation leads to reduction in water storage
capacity.

VIP EA (ENV1RONMENTAL CONCERNS)
Eutrophication/Aquatic weeds - Organic wastes accumulating in open water
sources lead to nutrient enrichment which encourages aquatic weed proliferation.
Aquatic weeds provide food for molluscs that support disease snail vectors and
also provide breeding grounds for mosquitoes. Decomposition of these weeds
initiate a cycle of depletion of dissolved oxygen which affects fish and other
organisms in the water. Ultimately the water quality is compromised particularly
in terns of BOD, Suspended solids and odour. The weeds also create physical
obstruction to water use including pipe blockage.
RI                .     Erosion - Land clearing and excavating to create impoundments provide
necessary conditions for erosion initiation. The intensity and severity of the
erosion would depend on such factors as terrain, soil type and rainfall intensity.
l                 4.1.2  Boreholes, Hand-dug Wells and Spring Development - 150 Facilities
Much of the country's ground water is deep and slow yielding and therefore developing
these resources raise the following concerns:
Ground water Quality/Contamination - Although ground water sources are
generally good as potable water, there are areas where problems of high
3                       concentrations of contaminants such as manganese, iron and high salinity exist.
Conditions of high total hardness and low pH also occur. The salinity problems
|                       occur in the coastal savannah areas. Low pH water tends to attack pumps and well
parts and this together with iron from rock fornations leads to the widespread
|                       occurrence of high iron concentrations. Use of agro-chemicals also results in some
level of ground water pollution especially in areas of high water table and porous
soils.

Ground water depletion/Aquifer Recharge - Sinking of wells to draw water
depletes ground water which is replaced through natural recharge. Where
withdrawal rate exceeds the aquifer recharge rate, problems arise leading to
dryness of the well as well as possible nearby shallow wells. If this persists the
whole aquifer could be depleted. Withdrawal of large amounts of ground water
causes porous formations to collapse resulting in subsidence. In such instances,
flooding becomes a problem if the area affected is coastal and sinks below sea
level. Rapid population growth can contribute to ground water over draft.
Aquifer depletion arising from over use of fresh water reservoirs may also cause
|                        salt water infiltration, especially along coastlines.
U                 *      Operation and Maintenance - Wells fitted with pumps raise problems of
maintenance and availability of spare parts. Most rural communities lack skilled
personnel and resources, these therefore affect the long term sustainability of such
*                        projects.
;                 *      Cost effectiveness - Generally the aquifers are deep and slow yielding and
relatively expensive to extract.
4.1.3  Streamflow Diversions, Pumping and Run-offManagement - 2135 hectares
These are to be provided mainly for irrigation to support agriculture. The following
|          n      concerns arise from their development and usage:
|                  s     Flooding - Streamflow diversion will introduce water to areas previously not in
the path of streamflow. Where such areas are low lying or has poor drainage, the
|                        risk of flooding becomes imminent.

IF                                     VIP EA (ENVIRONMENTAL CONCERNS)
Use of Fertilizers - Providing irrigation facilities will encourage intensive
agricultural practices. This will result in the disturbance of the natural soil nutrient
replenishment cycle associated with traditional fallow system used extensively by
rural farmers. Fertilizers will be applied to re-enrich the soil which has been
depleted through leaching and rapid plant growth. The use of fertilizer in itself is
problematic with regards to transportation, handling, storing and usage.
Waterlogging and Salinisation - These are common problems associated with
surface irrigation. Waterlogging is caused by inadequate drainage or over-
irrigation. This draws up salts from the lower portions of the soil below the
plants' roots to the top soils. Salinisation then results when the water evaporates
leaving a concentration of salts within the soil. In such situations soil quality
deteriorates which is difficult to rectify. Although salinisation is not yet a general
problem in  Ghana, dry areas in the north and in the coastal plains are more
3                          susceptible.
3      Water-Borne Diseases - Introduction of irrigation is associated with increase of
water-borne or water-related diseases.  The common diseases linked with
j                          irrigation are schistomiasis and malaria whose vectors proliferate in irrigation
waters.
*      Erosion - Irrigation leads to expansion and intensification of agriculture which has
3 |  -                     the potential for causing increased erosion. The severity of erosion could also be
influenced by the method of application of water, with spray systems being the
3                          least detrimental.

-   *  Conflicts with Downstream Users - Diverting streams for irrigation creates
conflicting demands and inequalities in distribution both in the Project area and
downstrearn. This may lead to social tension between affected communities if not
properly addressed.
4.1.4  Catchment Management Programme
A positive aspect of the VIP water resource component is the proposal to develop the
basic skills in communities for appropriate application of best catchment management
I                 practices which should enhance the ability to address some of the concerns raised above.
111               4.2   Rural Transport Infrastructure
4.2.1  Feeder Roads Rehabilitation
I                 Feeder roads are provided to create access to communities and facilitate travel mobility
*                 by linking primary and secondary roads. Under the VIP no new feeder roads are expected
to be constructed. The project will provide for the rehabilitation of 750 km of key feeder
_                 roads and spot improvement of about 1,050 km. This will involve construction of culverts
and drains and surface restoration. Some of the concerns arising here are:
l
a     Erosion - Surfaces of most feeder (rural) roads are not sealed and are therefore
|. -exposed to the elements making them prone to erosion particularly in areas of
heavy rainfall and poor drainage. Erosion affects the main carriageway and the
I                        drains especially at steep sections where it creates deep gullies. The combined
effects of gully erosion and localised ponding renders most feeder roads
3 |                      unmotorable during rainy seasons.

Dust - The various stages of rehabilitation works involving excavation,
transportation, discharging and compacting of mainly laterite will generate dust.
Vehicular traffic on the roads also generate dust. This has harmful effects on the
r   -                   labour force and impairs the photosynthetic function of vegetation
rl                .     Borrow Pits - Laterite excavation for road works creates borrow pits. These can
be found littered all over the rural areas and contribute to land degradation.
Borrow pits can trap water and create problems associated with stagnant water
bodies. They also have potential of disrupting natural drainage patterns.
*     HFlooding - Road alignment which interfere with flowpaths can cause flooding of
adjacent areas by blocking the flow and by increasing run-off. This could be
compounded by inadequate drainage along the road and unsuitable culverts.
1                 *      Ponding - Field studies reveal that establishing improper levels of drains during
construction and poor workmanship are the common causes of ponding of feeder
I                        roads. Crevices, gullies and depressions created by erosion and heavy trucks also
become receptacles for water leading to ponding. In severe cases, ponding may
i                        render feeder roads unmotorable particularly in the rainy seasons.
|                 *      Maintenance - Lack of resources (financial, human and material) are the main
constraints to proper maintenance of feeder roads. The nature and function of
|            ~           feeder roads are such that they require regular maintenance to keep them
operable.

YIP EA (ENVIRONMENTAL CONCERNS)
Social impacts - Improving on exiting feeder roads in the rural communities,
fl                       encourages over speeding, abuse by trucks with excessive axle load. Public health
and safety are worsened through accidents and dust generation. Opening up rural
fl'                      areas could be both beneficial (retaining the youth, access to vital social amenities)
and detrimental (influx of people and pressure on limited resources).
4.2.2  Village Tracks and Trails (VTTs)
DI                The project would provide for the construction of about 270 km of VTTs to link village
conmmunities to their farms and to allow for the use of Intermediate Means of Transport
(IMTs). The VTTs will have a standard width of 2.5 metres with shallow side ditches. The
issues of concern here are:

*     Dust
e     Ponding
3                 *      Maintenance
i                 Most of these concerns are similar to those discussed above for feeder roads, except that
for VTTs they are expected to be on a smaller scale. However the intensity of the
|                 negative impacts would depend on factors such as, location, terrain soil and rainfall among
others.

4.3    Rural Post-Harvest Infrastructure
4.3.1 Processing Equipment
Under the VIP, various processing equipment will be provided to facilitate post-harvest
management. These include grinding mills for small processors, shea butter extractors,
cassava processing and oil palm processing. Some of the processes and their respective
equipment have peculiar concerns which are discussed below. However all of them are
powered by diesel driven generators, the environmental concerns of which are also
discussed.
Sheabutter Extraction - 284 shea butter extractors.
The extraction of sheabutter begins with feeding washed kernels into a crusher (hammer
mill) for crushing into coarse particles. The crushed kernels are roasted in large metal
cooking pots on open fire to rapture the oil cells. During roasting the kernels are stirred
-vigorously with a long wooden stirrer to prevent the kernels from burning. The roasted
kernels are poured onto a cemented floor and spread out for cooling.
Next, the roasted kernels are milled into a paste using a 'corn mill'. The temperature of
the paste as discharged from the mill is far above the melting point of shea butter. The hot
paste is therefore allowed to cool. The paste is then introduced gradually into a kneader
to form homogeneous mixture of viscous paste or cream. The cream obtained is grainy
and loosely bound together, and contains small traces of brown slurry. It is then washed
with warm water after which water at room temperature is used to wash the cream several
times.

Finally the cream is put into a cooking pot and boiled on an open fire until all the water
rl                evaporates. A light yellowish-brown oil collects over a dark brown sludge (impurities)
at the bottomn of the pot. The oil is scooped into a metal bowl to cool and crystallise
overnight into fat. The end product, shea butter is packaged into calabashes and covered
with jute sacks for storage and sale.
Shea butter extraction produces substantial quantities of extraction residue of solid waste
||               in the form of brown slurry and impurities particularly sludge. The slurry and sludge are
usually disposed of in the immediate vicinity. These are organic waste which could end
up polluting nearby waters. This indiscriminate disposal also creates unsightly and
insanitary conditions in the neighbourhood. The same problems arise from allowing liquid
waste from the processes which is also organic in character, to flow freely in the
3                surroundings.
3                Cassava Processing - 264 cassava processing equipment.
3                Cassava is processed into gari, cassava dough or cassava chips. The processing into a dry
form particularly gari or chips reduces the moisture content and converts it into a more
durable and stable product which is easy to store and transport.
3                The processing involves series of operations. Peeled cassava is washed and cut into
smaller pieces which is sent to a processing centre for grating using mechanical device
|1               which is powered by diesel driven generator. The grated cassava is put in sacks and put
under screw press for dehydration. It is then sieved to remove fibrous matters. The fine
particles are then roasted in big metal pan using firewood as source of energy. The
roasted fine particles, which is the gari is allowed to cool and sieved again to remove any
I                lump from it.' The gari is then ready for consumption or packed in jute sacks for the
market.

VIP EA (ENVIRONMENTAL CONCERNS)
Cassava processing produces substantial quantities of solid waste in the form of peels,
fibrous matter and lumps. It also produces some liquid waste, dirty water from washing
of the cassava and starch from the screw press operations. These wastes are organic-based
|  9               and have similar potential pollution hazards as discussed above for shea butter extraction.
Oil Processing Equipment - 192 Oil palm processing equipment.
I                  Palm oil is extracted from the outer pulpy portion of the oil palm fruit by a series of
operations. The fruit is loosened from the bunches and allowed to 'dry ferment' in the sun
X                  for at least one week. The fruit is boiled using wood fuel and then transferred into a
digester and pulped while hot. Free oil is drained from the digested pulp by using a
I                  vertical screw press. The extraction residues containing intact nuts and some broken nuts
are further separated into nuts, kernels and shells. The nuts and kernels are dried, bagged
and stored for subsequent oil extraction, generally carried out at a different location.
Palm oil processing produces substantial quantities of solid waste in the form empty
j                  bunches, fibres, shells and extraction residue. The bunch stalk contains significant
quantities of recoverable nutrients and can create a major nuisance and disposal problems.
a                  Fibres, shells and other solid waste are normally burned as fuel. Uncontrollable burning
of solid waste releases smoke which contributes to air pollution.
I |                Liquid waste mainly originates from boiling tanks and is disposed off indiscriminately.
3.i                 General Issues:
General issues of concern relating to processing equipment arise from the use of diesel
driven generator as power source. The concerns cover fuel storage and handling, smoke
emission and noise generation. Safety hazards with regard to handling of mechanical
equipment, its maintenance and availability of spare parts are also of concern. The lack
of effluent characterisation and appropriate waste disposal facilities/methods also pose
some concern.

fl               using wood as fuel which is being discouraged.
rl               4.3.3  On-Farm and Village Storage
!                The VIP would provide 324 unit of on-farm storage and another 364 of improved on-farm
storage facilities.
The concerns are mainly:
I     Quality - The quality of stored farm produce will be affected by the environmental
i                       conditions such as humidity and temperature. In the absence of proper control
these could lead to deterioration of products in storage.
Pests and Pesticides - Farrn produce in storage are vulnerable to attack by insects
and rodents. These are controlled by the use of pesticides and raises concerns
regarding the handling and application of chemicals by unskilled persons which
|                       could have undesirable consequences within the environment.
|                 4.4 Special Issues of Concern
|                Issues of environmental concerns which are of a general nature and cutting across various
components of the VIP are discussed in this section.

4.4.1 Community Involvement
l
Interaction with stakeholders revealed 'that some of the major obstacles to effective
| -               project implementation and sustainability are the timing, extent and level of involvement
of beneficiary communities. If community involvement issues are not handled properly,
|                 they could create suspicion, tension and misunderstanding; eventually leading to
beneficiaries not fully identifying with the project or in rare cases rejection or sabotage.
4.4.2  Community Ownership
Projects components requiring communities to assume eventual ownership do face
problems resulting from inability of intended beneficiaries not being able to provide
financial equity contribution. This could lead to slow implementation and in extreme
cases, abandonment. This also serves aa disincentive and creates general apathy within
the community to supporting interventions aimed at helping them.
5                 4.4.3  Siting
I                 Siting of project components within a community poses a whole range of problems which
impact on project success. Some of the key issues are:
*     Locating projects near cultural sites such as sacred groves and burial grounds
I -                     which could be regarded as insulting and frowned upon or shunned by the people.
*     Conflict with existing or proposed land use which could create problems of
5 |                     incompatibility
*     Conflict with nearby communities leading to tension in the use of a given resource
|                       such as damming or diverting a stream.
*     Improper siting of water project where supply source is inadequate leading to
|                       water depletion or dry up.

VIP EA (ENVIRONMENTAL CONCERNS)
*     Proximity of a project component to receiving waters which may end up being
polluted. For example agro processing
*     Proximity to sanitary site for example a well near KVIP facility
I    . *   Sufficient land area for facility installation and future expansion
*     Ecologically sensitive sites such flat plains which are liable to flooding, aquifer
recharge zone which may be lost, steep terrain prone to erosion and threat to
fragile habitat and endangered species
4.4.4  Timing of Construction Activities
Timing of construction of some of the project component is critical either because of the
I                 labour base requirement or suitability of the environment. The factors of concern here
are:
I                 *     Gultural activities which take away the people from the cornmunity, such as
X                       festivals, funerals (north) and others which divert the attention of the people,
affect labour-based projects. In some part of the north, the period December to
1                       February is devoted to funeral. Other practices such as not permitting women to
engage in communal labour also pose problems. Some religious practices such as
extensive fasting reduces available labour force.
|  *  In some areas climatic conditions are vital consideration for construction. In dry
areas where water is scarce and the ground is very hard, construction activities are
best undertaken during the rainy periods.
|                *      Seasonal migration out of rural communities to seek employment for extended
periods (up to three months or more) also affect the labour supply.

5.0 RELEVANT ENVIRONMENTAL GUIDELINES
T  he components of the VIP will be implemented by various organisations including
I|           ~       Government agencies, NGOs, District Administrations, Private Sector and rural
communities. The environmental concerns raised earlier therefore require that some
|                aspects of Project design and implementation should be environmentally sensitive.
The following guidelines are provided to facilitate implementation of the various VIP
components. This would ensure that good environmental practices are adopted to avoid
and/or limit adverse consequences from the proposed interventions on the beneficiary
communities.
Some of the guidelines given below are of a general nature, applicable to all components
while others are component specific. These guidelines are not exhaustive, project
implemeritation should be guided by experience gained from other projects and knowledge
acquired by field staff.

5.1    General Guidelines
I
These guidelines cover the special issues of concerns like community involvement, site
I    scselection and timing of implementation identified earlier.
I                       5.1.1  Guidelines for Community Involvement
l  {  Selection of Contact Persons - Although their support and involvement is
essential, community leaders like chiefs and assembly members do not always
make the best contact persons for Project implementation. In some situations
5                       efforts should be made to identify other opinion leaders particularly those who
appear 'to catch the vision' and can assist in sensitising the people.
[ {   Education - Select beneficiary communities should be educated on all aspects of
I                       the intended intervention well ahead of time. This should include the benefits,
problems and financial implications among others. Animation, film shows, drama
!                       and posters are some of the methods that could be used to educate the people.
I                 1-    Conflict Resolution - All issues of conflict and rmisunderstanding identified prior
to implementation should be exhaustively addressed. The tendency of using the
Project itself as a means of overruling potential conflict and rnisunderstanding
should be avoided.
I  '[    Maintenance - All components of the VIP should be designed to conform with
the Village Level Operation and Maintenance (VLOM) concept, where the
I                      *'beneficiaries would be able to operate and maintain the facilities which will be put
at their disposal. The Community Water Management methods developed under
I                       the CWSP could be adapted in other sectors.

5.1.2 Guidelinesfor Community Ownership
*  lf    Most of the communities targeted by the VIP are among the poorest of the poor
who may not be able to afford even the least expected financial contribution
l                       towards eventual ownership. Many credit schemes to assist such groups are now
operative. Steps should be taken to introduce the beneficiaries to organisations
ft                      like Regional ITTUs, ASIP, DANIDA NBSSI, Rural Enterprises Project, IFAD
and Agricultural Development Bank, who are involved in rural credit schemes.J
j                |5.1.3  Guidelines for Selecting Project Sites
In general, technical considerations may limit the range of alternative sites for some
components, particularly water projects. It is expected that all necessary studies, eg
i                hydrological, climatic, soils, etc, for relevant components will be carried out by
appropriate authorities. However the following must be considered.
3                s1    Cultural Sites - Avoid locating projects near cultural sites such as sacred groves
and burial grounds and other places that may give offence to the people.
-  1f    Ecologically Sensitive Sites - Avoid ecologically sensitive sites which may be a
I                ~~~~~~threat.to fragile habitats and/or endangered species..

should be avoided as much as possible.
_r {  Seasonal Migration - Periods and seasons when some of the people migrate out
I                       of their communities to seek employment elsewhere should be factored into the
planning .

l                 5.2   Guidelines for Water Projects
I                The environmental concerns raised for the sub-components of the water project are mostly
.             similar and the following points need to be considered.
Water Quality/Contamination - Water intended for human and animal
consumption should be subjected to regular quality analysis to ensure that it is
I                       suitable. This applies to both surface and ground water components. Where
dugouts are provided, separate infiltration wells for human consumption and
i                       drinking troughs for animals should also be incorporated. In those cases where
similar provisions have to be made for both human and animal consumption,
construction of that for the animals should precede that for the people. This will
prevent the animals from  contaminating the facility intended for human
I                |      consumption.
a                '[    Disease Vectors - These are associated with surface water projects (dugouts,
i                       impoundments and irrigation) and recommended preventive measures include
1                       *     Use of lined canals or pipes to discourage vectors
+     Avoidance of stagnant or slowly moving water (irrigation)
1  .                    *     Use of straight or slightly curving canals
+     Installation of gates at canal ends to allow complete flushing
*     Disease prophylaxis

l                              with cover and lock
l                       *      Ponds, dugouts and impoundments should be fenced. This could be either
wire and pole or suitable plants such as thom bush or 'Pride of Barbados'
v      Ground water Depletion/Aquifer Recharge - This is relevant for well projects.
i                       Design considerations should ensure that abstraction rates are consistent with
l                       natural aquifer recharge.

evaporation and seepage. Design capacity should take this into consideration to
I                       ensure all year round supply especially in the dry areas of the north.
l f   .....................Sedimentation/Siltation - Open water sources exposed to sedimentation have
their storage  capacity reduced. Farming and other land clearing activities

encourage aquatic weed growth. This should be reduced by preventing farming
activities in the vicinity.

Erosion - Steep areas are generally prone  to erosion. Lands selected for
irrigation should be level or have minimum slope. Systems utilising pumping
should have discharge rates controlled below infiltration rate.
-f    Waterlogging and Salinisation - Inadequate drainage of irrigated lands leads to
waterlogging and possible salinisation. The following measures could be adopted:
I=-               ,             Regulation of water application to avoid overwatering

Salinisation may further be controlled by leaching of salts through periodic flushing of
soils.
I
lf    Flooding - This is associated with streamflow diversion and damming for
irrigation. Design should incorporate measures to protect flood prone areas and
communities at risk.
X     Conflict with Downstream  Users - This may arise with projects involving
diversion of water sources. Measures to ensure equitable distribution among users
I                        should be devised, implemented and monitored.

5.3   Guidelines for Rural Transport Infrastructure
The environmental concerns raised under this component mainly affect road works and
track construction for which guidelines will be given below. Guidelines relating to IMTs
have already been addressed under the section General Guidelines.
5.3.1 Guidelinesfor Feeder Roads Rehabilitation and Construetion of VTTs
Erosion - Exposed surfaces of Feeder Roads and VTTs and their drains render
them prone to erosion. Preventive to steps to adopt include:
*     As much as possible avoid steep sections in roads and drains. Where this
is unavoidable due to the terrain, road surfaces should be sealed with
bitumen and drains lined with concrete.
*     Provide adequate drainage for Feeder Roads and VTTs
*     Provide scour checks to slow down flowing waters and reduce erosion
3@                            effect.
Dust - The impact of dust generation from Feeder Roads and VTTs is more of a
residual problem. However, during construction, efforts should be made to
reduce dust impacts by frequent watering and good work practices.
Borrow Pits/Quarries - Excavating for laterite and gravel create stagnant water
bodies in borrow pits and quarries. These become habitats for breeding o
mosquitoes and other disease vectors. Methods of control include filling, draining
and improved landscaping.

In lWVIP EA (GUIDELINES)
Guidelines for Feeder Roads Rehabilitation and Construction cont'd..
vf    Flooding - Road alignment which cuts across water flowpaths and inadequate
drainage lead to flooding and may render feeder roads and VTTs unusable.
Appropriate culverts should be designed to eliminate flooding. Drifts could be
used in places where culverts are not effective.
X     Ponding - Ponding of roads and tracks results from water collection in crevices
and gullies created by erosion or poor drainage due to lack of adequate camber.
Good design and effective supervision during construction should eliminate most
|l     ponding problems. Proper levels of drains should be established and maintained.
Axle loads of trucks using Feeder Roads should be regulated to avoid depressions
which also cause ponding.

5.4    Guidelines for Rural Post-Harvest Processing
Issues of concern for this component are mainly those of waste disposal and use of diesel
driven generators, guidelines for which are discussed below. Guidelines for other issues
(siting, community involvement and maintenance) have already been provided in the
relevant section.
5.4.1  Guidelinesfor Agro-Processing
fl  I  Solid Waste - All the processing equipment generate solid waste some of which
could be re-used in other processes or re-cycled. Efforts should be made to
analyse and characterise these wastes to determine other possible uses. Adequate
disposal areas should be created close to the facility and ensure patronage by the
beneficiaries.
f    Liquid Waste - Effluent from processing equipment is generally organic and may
pollute nearby water bodies. Liquid waste should be analysed and characterised
I                        to determine possible uses. Disposal channels should be kept away from water
sources supplying the community. Limitations for liquid effluent from various
agro-processes should be determined and applied. For example World Banik
Guidelines for Palm Oil Effluent control is as follows:
pH    6to9
BOD  < 100 mg/l
COD  < 1000 mg/l
TSS   < 500 mg/l
In certain cases where control limits are exceeded, appropriate collection points
l                        will have to be designed.

wood fuel is not environmentally sustainable.  With the increase in LPG
availability, attempts should be made to adapt the design to be able to use gas for
the smoking.
-v'    Diesel Generators - The lack of electricity in most rural areas ensures that diesel
Rl                      generators continue to be the main source of power for rural agro-processing
equipment. The concerns for safety in the handling and storage of fuel, the
E                l      dangers posed by the moving parts and smoke emission should be addressed by
training and implementing basic environmental and Health and Safety practices

5.5    Guidelines for On-Farm and Village Level Storage
Improvement in storage facilities enhances quality and prevents attacks by rodents and
pests.
Quality - In the absence of adequate warehouses, the use of mud silos which are
generally airtight prevents deterioration of well dried grains and preserves quality
over long periods. This practice should be encouraged. Quality of seeds may be
preserved by storage in airtight containers, such as earthenware pots.
_I                ,f    Protection Against Rodents and Pests - Methods available for protecting farm
produce against attacks from rodents and insects include, raising platforms and
U                        incorporating rodent guards on supporting structures, fumigating with phostoxin
tablets in airtight storage areas. Tobacco and Neem  extracts are used by some
rural farmers as effective pesticides.
U                        The use of mud silos which are fire proof provides further protection to dry crops

VIP EA (CONCLUSION)
6.0   CONCLUSION
6.1    Capacity Building
T  he VIP incorporates  various capacity building prograrnmes within the sub-
components with the view to ensuring that people in the beneficiary communities are
able to manage the provided infrastructure on sustainable basis.
The Pilot Integrated Catchment Management which comes under the water component,
would train the communities to acquire basis skills in watershed management and
conservation practices.
Under the transport component, technology transfer and training would be provided to
,,
the communities to enable them maintain the facilities provided. The training of labour-
based contractors should provide them with more employable skills that could be utilised
outside their communities and thus enhancing their empowerment.
Apart from technical skills, the post-harvest component would develop the managerial and
enterpreneural skills among the rural dwellers. This would help them to manage their own
enterprises efficiently and open up opportunities for innovation and expansion.
6.2   Projected Socio-economic Impacts
The overall objective of the VIP is to reduce poverty and increase the quality of life of the
|r                rural poor through increased transfer of technical and financial resources to develop basic,
sustainable village level infrastructure. This section presents a qualitative assessment of
3                 the projected impacts on s6cio-economic aspects of the rural communities.

Provision of water would impact positively and strongly on health, sanitation and hygiene,
D                 and productivity. Good drinking water free of contamination would create a healthier
rural community. Children would be less susceptible to intestinal and other water borne
diseases. Health care costs would be reduced, and the quality of life will improve.
1  -              Providing clean water within close proximity will eliminate the excessive number of hours
in the day that women and children spend in fetching water for household use. The
|                 children can use this time studying and developing other skills.
I                 Improvement in rural transport infrastructure, should impact strongly on productivity
post- harvest management and income levels. The rehabilitaiton of existing feeder roads
and clearing of farm tracks will render the areas more accessible. With improved
transportation, farm produce and processed products can be managed better into the
markets with reduced losses. Improved transport will make it easier for rural communities
to have access to needed services such health care and agricultural extension.
Indirect impacts would be on education and housing. Road accessibility will make it
easier for children to go to school on foot or by public transport. It would also open up
avenues for older children to pursue higher education. Residents of major towns and
cities, particularly in the Coastal Zone may opt to build their homes in nearby villages and
commute to work in the cities. Feeder road rehabilitation will reduce travel time and
improve access to services.
