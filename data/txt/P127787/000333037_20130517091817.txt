                                  LOAN AND PROGRAM SUMMARY
                                        REPUBLIC OF TURKEY
              COMPETITIVENESS AND SAVINGS DEVELOPMENT POLICY LOAN (CSDPL)
Borrower            Republic of Turkey
Implementing        Undersecretariat of Treasury
Agency
Financing Data      IBRD Loan
                    Terms: Flexible Loan at 6 months EURIBOR for Euro plus variable
                    spread, with a 20 year maturity including 3.5 years of grace period with
                    commitment linked with level repayment pattern.
                    Amount: EURO 624.1 million (USD 800 million equivalent)
Operation Type      The proposed operation will be a single tranche stand-alone Development
                    Policy Loan (DPL). The Bank's existing exposure framework does not
                    enable a multi-year programmatic DPL engagement in Turkey and the
                    Authorities are currently in the final year of the Ninth Development Plan.
                    In case revisions are made to the Bank's exposure framework, the medium-
                    term agenda outlined in this Document is expected to be part of a policy
                    dialogue under future potential DPL engagements in the context of the
                    Tenth Development Plan.
Main Policy Areas   General public administration, general industry and trade, non-compulsory
                    pensions, capital markets
Key Outcome         The proposed DPL would support Turkey’s growth to high income status
Indicators          through the implementation of reforms in two key areas: (i) bolstering
                    competitiveness via an improved business environment and better
                    governance; and (ii) boosting domestic savings and deepening the
                    financial sector. Key outcome indicators include:
                         • Ease of Doing Business Shareholder Suits and Extent of Director
                             Liability sub-indices increases from 4 in 2012 to 5 in 2013.
                         • The number of firms completing statutory independent audits
                             increases from 700 in 2012 to 1,400 in 2013.
                         • Cost of contract enforcement as measured by attorney and court
                             fees as a share of debt value falls from 28 percent in 2011 to less
                             than 25 percent by 2013.
                         • The recovery rate for audits (the ratio of employees identified as
                             unregistered to the total number of employees in the workplace
                             audited) increases from 6 percent in 2012 to 7 percent in 2013.
                         • Early exit rates from the pension scheme in the first three years of
                             contract decline from 21 percent in 2012 to 19 percent in 2013.
                         • The issuance of corporate bonds increases from Turkish Lira (TL)
                             27 billion in November 2012 to TL 35 billion in 2013.
                         • Leasing penetration rate increases from 4.7 percent in 2011 to 5.5
                             percent in 2013.
Program             The objective of the program supported by the proposed operation is to
Development         facilitate Turkey’s growth to high-income status by bolstering
Objective(s) and    competitiveness and boosting domestic savings, thus reducing external
Contribution to     vulnerabilities over the medium term.
Country Partnership
Strategy (CPS)      The reform program supported by this operation falls primarily under
                    strategic theme 1 of the CPS, namely to sustain macroeconomic and
                    financial sustainability and to enhance competitiveness and employment.
Risks and Risk   Macroeconomic risks. Turkey’s dependence on external financing remains
Mitigation       the main risk to the economic outlook, but downside and upside risks are
                 evenly balanced thus far in 2013. In spite of the significant correction in
                 2012, the country’s large current account deficit and the composition of its
                 financing remain a concern. Under a deepened crisis scenario in the
                 Eurozone including a global liquidity squeeze, Turkey could possibly face
                 a Gross Domestic Product (GDP) contraction, given the country’s
                 dependence on foreign financing. On the other hand, a global economic
                 upswing and a faster than expected acceleration in domestic demand in
                 2013 present an upside risk to the baseline in the short term, but through
                 rising global interest rates could also complicate macroeconomic
                 management for Turkey beyond 2013. The proposed operation helps
                 mitigate risks associated with Turkey’s external vulnerabilities over the
                 medium term by supporting reforms to boost the competitiveness of the
                 private sector. This supports stronger exports, larger inflows of foreign
                 direct investment (FDI), increased long-term savings, and deeper financial
                 markets.
                 Implementation risks. The effective and full implementation of some of
                 the reforms supported by the program will be challenging, in particular:
                 (i) The effective implementation of the newly enacted Commercial Code
                 will require retraining and updating the capacity of the auditing profession
                 to deal with enhanced transparency and accountability and is likely to put
                 additional pressure on the judicial system. One key mitigating factor is the
                 phased implementation of the legislation.
                 (ii) The main risk in implementation of the Capital Markets Law (CML) is
                 that the capacity of the Capital Markets Board (CMB) may not yet be
                 sufficient to optimally utilize its enhanced powers under the new CML.
                 The Bank is continuing to work with the CMB including to further
                 enhance its capacity.
                 (iii) The main risks in the implementation of the private pension legislation
                 in the long run arise from the possibility of increased fiscal liabilities due
                 to faster than currently projected growth in matching contributions and the
                 possibility that investment returns continue to be low, based on high fees
                 charged by the private providers. The mitigating factor is that an improved
                 domestic saving base (larger and longer-term) will reduce external
                 vulnerability, promote sustainable high growth, which will in turn increase
                 tax revenues.
                 (iv) The main risk in the implementation of the Leasing Law stems from
                 the differences of the new law compared to international models.
                 Mitigation measures include continued dialogue with the Authorities to
                 support implementation, including in the context of a possible credit line in
                 support of the domestic leasing industry.
                 Political risks. Turkey’s political situation is stable, but economic reform
                 efforts may suffer from a heavy policy agenda and the upcoming electoral
                 cycle. A new constitution is also under discussion. Local elections are
                 scheduled for 2014, followed by presidential elections the same year, and
                 the parliamentary elections in 2015. The forthcoming elections may lead
                 to a slowdown in the key structural reforms and possibly some increase in
                 fiscal spending. Turkey’s neighborhood moreover remains a source of
                 potential instability.

    PROPOSED COMPETITIVENESS AND SAVINGS DEVELOPMENT POLICY LOAN
                               (CSDPL)
                     TO THE REPUBLIC OF TURKEY


                                           I.    INTRODUCTION

1.      Turkey’s rapid growth and development over the past decade is one of the success
stories of the global economy. After a banking crisis in 2001, the country embarked on a
concerted path of structural reform supported by strong fiscal consolidation, strengthened
banking supervision, a reform of the social security system, and the shift to a flexible exchange
rate regime with an independent Central Bank responsible for inflation targeting. Per-capita
income subsequently almost tripled in less than a decade, and Turkey, with a population of
almost 75 million, is now an upper middle-income country with the world’s 18th largest
economy1. Social outcomes have also improved considerably as a result of economic growth
and improved public service delivery, with increased access to education (and virtually universal
enrollment at the primary level) and health services (linked to the Health Transformation
Program).

2.      Further enhancing the economy’s potential over the medium term and reaching
high-income status will require more structural reforms, particularly at the micro level, to
bolster competitiveness and boost private savings. Turkey’s business environment remains
relatively burdensome, with the country ranking 71st in the 2013 Doing Business Ratings
(Figures 1-4). Improving the investment climate is critical for raising Turkey’s labor
productivity growth and further boosting its export performance. Turkey also has considerable
potential to attract further FDI inflows (where Turkey ranks 23rd globally), bringing in associated
new technologies, and providing a more stable source of external financing. The implementation
of further micro reforms to deepen the financial sector will help provide greater access to
financial services for all citizens and can also contribute to reversing the significant decline in
Turkey’s domestic saving rates that took place over the past decade. Continuing the fight against
informality will reinforce the payoff to the Government’s other reform efforts including in the
area of competitiveness and domestic savings.

3.      This document describes a proposed Euro 624.1 million (USD 800 million
equivalent) Competitiveness and Savings Development Policy Loan (CSDPL) to Turkey. It
is a one-tranche stand-alone operation. The objective of the program supported by the proposed
operation is to facilitate Turkey’s growth to high-income status by bolstering competitiveness
and boosting domestic savings, thus reducing external vulnerabilities over the medium term.

4.       This operation is a critical part of the new CPS, which was endorsed by the
Executive Board on March 27, 2012. It advances the outcomes under Pillar I, sustaining
macroeconomic and financial sustainability and enhancing competitiveness and employment.
The DPL will contribute to the following expected CPS outcomes under the competitiveness
pillar: (i) sustained macroeconomic and financial stability and strengthened exports, domestic

savings, and external resilience and (ii) improved investment and business climate; deepened and
broadened access to finance. The operation will also contribute to deepening reforms for
improved competitiveness, one of the main strategic priorities in the 2012 Europe and Central
Asia (ECA) Regional strategy.

POLITICAL CONTEXT

5.     Economic growth has been aided by a period of political stability. The Justice and
Development Party (AKP) led by the Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdoğan won the
parliamentary elections for a third term in June 2011 and recently entered its tenth year in power.
Parliament started to work on a new constitution in October 2011.

6.      Turkey’s regional and global role has grown, especially since 2010. Turkey has set
out to strengthen its relations with countries in the region, and recent political developments in
the Middle East and North Africa (MENA) have focused attention on Turkey’s political and


                                                      2
economic system, with some countries increasingly looking to Turkey as an inspiration for their
own development. Nevertheless, Turkey’s neighborhood continues to be a source of potential
instability. The violence in Syria has caused large inflows of refugees (200,000) to Turkey.

7.      Turkey is a candidate country for European Union (EU) membership although the
momentum behind the accession process has been lost for some time. Turkey has a deep-
rooted relationship with the EU and the EU is Turkey’s largest economic partner. The country
has benefited significantly from deepening integration with the EU through growing
sophistication of both exports and imports and improved access to financing. The process of
harmonization with European legislation and regulation continues to be an anchor for Turkey’s
reform agenda even though the accession process itself lost momentum. Following the June 2011
elections, the Government upgraded the institution which oversees EU accession to the new
Ministry for EU Affairs. Since negotiations began in 2005, 13 Chapters of the 35 Chapters of
the EU Acquis Communautaire have been opened and one Chapter on Science and Research has
been provisionally closed. In early 2013, France moved to re-launch EU’s strained relationship
with Turkey, reversing a block on Ankara’s membership negotiations after years of deadlock.
This move is a positive signal for further improvement of Turkey’s relations with the EU.

RECENT ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENTS IN TURKEY

Strong growth and crisis resilience

8.      Turkey’s economy performed well in the last decade thanks to sound
macroeconomic management and structural reforms implemented since the 2001 banking
crisis. As a result, the Turkish economy grew by 5.1 percent a year on average during 2002-
2012, compared to the long –term pre-2001 average of around 4 percent; per capita income more
than tripled and reached USD 10,504 in 2012; inflation declined to single digits and gross public
debt fell from 73.4 percent of GDP in 2002 to 39.7 percent in 2012 (Table 1). 2 Both financial
and nonfinancial corporate balance sheets became healthier and market confidence returned,
while citizens and enterprises benefited from stronger public financial management (PFM) and
improved public services.

9.      With rising confidence, the rate of private domestic saving declined, making
Turkey’s economy dependent on foreign financing and vulnerable to a change in global
market sentiment. Before the 2001 crisis, the main source of vulnerability for the economy was
mostly the public sector (e.g., the 1994 crisis). In contrast, over the course of the last decade,
dependency on external capital flows has become the main risk. The private saving rate declined
from 23.4 percent of GDP in 2002 to 13.1 in 2007 (and has remained around that level since) on
the back of increased consumer confidence, lower interest rates, and improved access to credit.
Hence, when global liquidity tightened abruptly during the 2008-2009 crisis, Turkey’s economy
was hit hard with GDP shrinking by 4.8 percent in 2009.

    During the same period, purchasing power-parity based GDP per capita almost doubled and reached USD 15,029
     in 2012.

2/Gross public debt as defined by the Undersecretariat of Treasury varies from the EU defined general government
debt stock definition. The difference arises from the following adjustment items for EU defined debt: (i) recording
of zero coupon securities at face value; (ii) inclusion of inflation variation for CPI indexed bonds; (iii) inclusion of
coins in circulation issued by the Undersecretariat of Treasury; and, exclusion of the government securities held by
different public sector institutions, (iv) exclusion of debt stocks of SOEs.

10.    Strong financial and fiscal buffers, a well-designed policy response, and a surge in
capital inflows to emerging markets after 2009 allowed Turkey to bounce back quickly
from the crisis with record high growth in 2010-2011. The policy response to the crisis
included cuts of 10.25 percentage points to the policy rate of the Central Bank of the Republic of
Turkey and fiscal measures to stimulate employment and credit growth. Turkey’s strong macro
and debt fundamentals made the country attractive to foreign capital as global liquidity
conditions eased in 2010. Moreover, Turkey was able to compensate the fall in exports to the
troubled EU market with growing exports to MENA and other regions. GDP growth reached
record highs of 9.2 percent and 8.8 percent respectively in 2010 and 2011, among the fastest
recoveries recorded by any country.

11.     However, Turkey’s recovery was driven by domestic demand and accompanied by a
deterioration in external and internal balances. The contribution of domestic demand to
growth was 13.5 percent and 10.0 percent respectively in 2010 and 2011, as credit growth
reached 34.2 percent and 31.0 percent (Figure 5). At the same time, economic growth and rising
energy prices pushed net energy imports up to 6.2 percent of GDP in 2011 from 4.6 percent the
year before. Consequently, the current account deficit widened from 6.2 percent of GDP in 2010
to 9.7 percent in 2011. With booming domestic credit and aggregate demand, in 2011 inflation
overshot the Central Bank’s target of 5.5 percent by a full 5 percentage points. Although energy
prices and exchange rate pass-through played important roles, the 8.1 percent year-on-year
increase in the core price index-I shows that domestic demand exerted upward pressure on
headline inflation dynamics. 3 At the end of 2011, forward-looking inflation expectations
reported by the Central Bank rose to 7.1 percent compared with the 2012 policy target of 5
percent.

12.    Ample global liquidity conditions and positive interest rate differentials with the
advanced economies kept the current account comfortably financed, albeit largely with
short-term inflows. In the wake of the crisis, the reliance on short-term financing increased, as
FDI and other long-term inflows accounted for only 24 percent and 39 percent of total deficit
financing in 2010 and 2011 respectively (Figure 6). While Turkey ranked 23rd globally in terms
of absolute FDI inflows, measured in relation to GDP, Turkey’s FDI inflows at around one
percent have remained below other middle income countries, particularly those in Central and
Eastern Europe.

                                           Box 1: The Unorthodox Monetary Policy

After the global crisis of 2008 and 2009, the central banks of the major advanced economies reduced policy interest rates to
historically low levels and implemented quantitative easing policies. This resulted in high capital inflows to emerging markets,
including Turkey. This has complicated macroeconomic management for emerging economies. As a result, the Central Bank
introduced an “unorthodox? policy mix in November 2010 with the goal of discouraging larger capital inflows while allowing
flexibility to help lower inflation. The policy mix includes a lower policy rate, higher reserve requirements and a wider interest
rate corridor (the corridor between overnight lending and overnight borrowing rates). Initially, the policy did not have the
desired effect, as domestic credit boomed with ample external financing and the current account and inflation reached alarming
levels in 2011. Banks were able to boost credit despite Central Bank policies, as macro prudential tools especially on the banks’
non-core (i.e., non-deposit) liabilities were sparsely used. The banking sector responded to the Central Bank’s sharp reserve
requirement hikes on TL liabilities by increasing their non-core funding sources, especially interbank foreign exchange loans. In
2011, non-core liabilities of the banking sector increased by 48 percent year on year compared to a 13 percent rise in core
liabilities.

Active use of interest rate corridor
In October 2011, the external conditions deteriorated resulting in
an aggressive currency selloff. Accordingly, the Central Bank
adjusted its policy mix with a more active usage of the interest
rate corridor in which the funding level and costs to the banking
sector are determined on a daily basis. The Central Bank was
funding the banking system through the one-week repo auctions
before October 2011. The quantity of funding supplied through
repo auctions was determined by the banking sector’s demand
and the cost was approximately equal to the policy rate.
However, after October 2011, the Central Bank started to
determine the funding level itself on a daily basis. On the so
called “exceptional? days, the Central Bank did not offer any
money through repo auctions, which made the policy rate
irrelevant to the average funding costs. As the Central Bank holds
the net lender position in the financial system, the banking sector
had to use the secondary market, which offers funding with a higher cost (around the overnight lending rate). While the
framework has a direct impact on average funding costs, it also has an indirect effect on costs through the increased uncertainty.
Hence using this framework, the Central Bank increased average funding costs for the banking sector by 250bps between
October 2011 and June 2012.

Asymmetric Reserve Requirement Ratios (RRRs) and Reserve Option Coefficients (ROCs)
Along with the active usage of the interest rate corridor, the Central Bank introduced asymmetric RRRs to its toolbox in October
2011. The asymmetric RRRs allow the banks to fulfill a portion of their TL reserve requirements by holding foreign exchange or
gold at the Central Bank. As of October 2012, the banks are allowed to hold up to 90 percent of their TL required reserves in
foreign exchange or gold. Having put the asymmetric RRR mechanism in place, the Central Bank added a twist to the
mechanism by introducing ROCs. In the original asymmetric RRR mechanism, for every TL1 required reserve, the banks were
allowed to hold TL1 worth of foreign exchange or gold. However, under the ROC mechanism, the amount of foreign exchange
that should be held in lieu of TL1 required reserves is found by multiplying the TL amount with the ROC. These instruments act
as an automatic stabilizer and contributed to an increase in reserves from USD 88 billion in 2011 to USD 118 billion (equals to 6
months of imports) in 2012.


Macroeconomic policy dilemmas

13.    Facing the risk of hot money inflows and the need to re-balance the economy, the
authorities introduced an “unorthodox? policy mix in November 2010. Under the policy, a
low base rate was intended to discourage hot money inflows while a considerably higher
overnight borrowing rate and higher reserve requirements were aimed at containing credit
expansion. The efforts by the Central Bank were supported by the Banking Regulation and
Supervision Agency (BRSA), which imposed loan-to-value ceilings on mortgages and increased
provisioning requirements and risk weights on general purpose loans in the second half of 2011.
The authorities also raised special consumption taxes on various imported goods to contain the
trade deficit. These measures initially failed to slow credit growth. However, the Central Bank


                                                                6
started to use the interest rate corridor more actively in the last quarter of 2011 by determining
the funding costs of the banking sector on a daily basis and using asymmetric reserve
requirements to control the growth of non-core liabilities of the banking sector (Box 1). The
resulting tightening of liquidity was successful in cooling domestic demand from late 2011
onwards.

14.     Exchange rate depreciation followed by decisive monetary tightening in the second
half of 2011 succeeded in rebalancing the economy and helped Turkey achieve a soft
landing in 2012. TL depreciated by almost 20 percent against USD during 2011, as global
confidence deteriorated and the Central Bank initially maintained rates low. However, after
October 2011, the Central Bank increased the average funding cost of the banking sector sharply
by 500 bps points. In 2012, monetary tightening was effective in cooling domestic demand with
private investments shrinking by 4.5 percent, while net exports benefited from increased
competitiveness. GDP expanded by 2.2 percent, the contribution of domestic demand fell to -1.9
percentage points while net exports added 4.1 percentage points to GDP in 2012. Increased gold
exports contributed to the 8.8 percent year-on-year increase in total exports in 2012 (Box 2)
while imports declined by 1.8 percent during the same period. Consequently, the current account
deficit eased 6 percent of GDP in 2012, although FDI and long term inflows stood at around 51
percent of total deficit financing.
                                                   Box 2: The Gold Effect

Headline export growth of 13 percent in 2012 looks impressive in the light of the crisis in the Eurozone, Turkey’s main export
market. One of the important reasons behind the solid export performance was gold exports to Iran, United Arab Emirates and
Switzerland. Net of gold exports of USD 7.8 billion in 2012, exports expanded at a more moderate 6 percent. Interestingly, in
2011, Turkey was a net importer of gold for USD 3.3 billion, implying that approximately 1.4 percentage point of the correction
in the current account deficit to GDP ratio arose from “the gold effect?. Data for January 2013 show that Turkey has become a
net gold importer again. Meanwhile, gold exports do not affect GDP growth as Turkish Statistical Institute (TurkStat) calculates
the GDP from production side.



15.     With growth slowing markedly, monetary policy has gradually eased since June
2012 with some initial signs of a revival in credit growth. The average funding cost for the
banking sector has been reduced by 335 basis points and stood at 5.5 percent in February 2013.
As a result, 12-month credit growth adjusted for exchange rate fluctuations rose to 18.9 percent
in February from 15.5 percent in October 2012. In addition, the Central Bank started to narrow
the interest rate corridor by cutting the overnight lending rate from September 2012.

16.     Fiscal policy played a less prominent role in managing the cycle after the 2009 crisis.
The vigorous growth performance in 2010 and 2011 resulted in a surge in revenues and helped
the central government attain its budget targets. However, in 2012, with growth slowing
markedly, the central government budget deficit reached 2.0 percent of GDP compared to a
target of 1.5 percent (and an outturn of 1.4 percent in 2011). This is primarily due to increased
personnel and capital expenditures and delayed price adjustments in the energy sector which, in
turn, caused current transfers to State Owned Enterprises (SOEs) to increase. Personnel
expenditures exceeded the target by 5.4 percent as a result of an increase both in the number of
permanent staff and wage indexation. Capital expenses were 22.5 percent higher than budgeted
because the government wanted to compensate for the decline in private investment. Revenues

consumption, with indirect tax revenues increasing only by 5 percent year-on-year. However,
thanks to the special consumption tax increases in the final quarter of the year, revenue targets
have been met in 2012. The increasing rigidity of current expenditures and the cyclical
sensitivity of revenues are an increasing source of risk going forward.

17.     Overall, 2012 stands out as the first successful episode of a controlled economic
slowdown in Turkey’s recent economic history. This achievement and the remaining strong
fiscal and financial sector buffers earned Turkey an upgrade to investment grade by Fitch in
November 2012. 4 Bond and equity markets have responded with a bounce. The yield on
Turkey’s 30-year Eurobond declined to 4.3 percent in December 2012 from 6.4 percent a year
earlier and the Istanbul Stock Exchange (ISE) index has risen more than 50 percent since the end
of 2011. While this is welcome news, it does not make macroeconomic management any easier
going forward.

Poverty and Gender

18.     Rapid economic growth and sound social policies have led to significant poverty
reduction and improvements in social welfare in Turkey over the last decade. According to
official estimates, extreme poverty virtually disappeared. Poverty decreased from 28 percent in
2003 to 17 percent in 2008 and increased only slightly in 2009 to 19 percent (no official poverty
figures are available since 2009). Shared prosperity, measured by the income growth among the
bottom 40 percent of the distribution, rose 7.8 percent per year from 2002 to 2008, compared
with 6.4 percent for the population on average. As a consequence, the share of total income at
the bottom of the distribution increased during this period.

19.     Gender equality has improved in education and health, but large inequalities
remain in access to opportunities. There are virtually no differences in vaccinations and
stunting between boys and girls younger than 5 years. Maternal mortality has been sharply
reduced. Nearly all girls and boys attend primary school and, in 2011, the secondary enrolment
rate of girls at 66 percent lagged 6 percent behind the 72 percent for boys. However, in spite of
recent progress, only over a quarter of women work (as opposed to two-thirds of men), and many
of them do so in the informal sector. Improving women’s access to more and better jobs and
creating opportunities for entrepreneurship will increase total productive employment.

MACROECONOMIC OUTLOOK AND DEBT SUSTAINABILITY

20.      Following a soft landing in 2012, economic growth is forecast to stage a moderate
increase in 2013 before returning to trend in 2014 and beyond. GDP has expanded by 2.2
percent in 2012. A pickup in growth of domestic demand in 2013 is expected to lead to a slight
widening in external balances in the short-term. Financing is expected to remain adequate,
facilitated by the expansionary policy bias around the world and continuation of solid
macroeconomic management in Turkey. Growth is forecast to reach 5 percent over the medium
term while the current account deficit is anticipated to ease to around 6 percent owing to stronger
export performance on the back of enhanced competitiveness and productivity and a recovery in
global growth (Table 2). Throughout the projection period, the real exchange rate is forecast to

     the investment grade in Moody’s and S&P’s assessments.

appreciate 2 percent a year, broadly in line with productivity growth. Improved external
balances will help reduce the reliance on foreign capital inflows and associated vulnerabilities.

21.     The baseline forecast is predicated on the current policy mix remaining appropriate,
mitigating potential risks of renewed deterioration in external imbalances. The baseline
scenario assumes that policy makers will take necessary measures to curb excessive credit
growth. If the authorities choose to implement accommodative fiscal and monetary policies, the
low cost of external borrowing could well fuel renewed overheating risks. This could result in a
deterioration of external imbalances and reverse the disinflationary trend.

1/ Gross public debt as defined by the Undersecretariat of Treasury varies from the EU defined general government
debt stock definition. The difference arises from the following adjustment items for EU defined debt: (i) recording
of zero coupon securities at face value; (ii) inclusion of inflation variation for CPI indexed bonds; (iii) inclusion of
coins in circulation issued by Treasury; and, exclusion of the government securities held by different public sector
institutions, (iv) exclusion of debt stocks of SOEs.

22.      Inflation is expected to settle to about 5 percent. Despite the upward pressures exerted
by administrative price hikes, 12-month consumer price inflation eased from 10.4 percent in
December 2011 to 6.2 percent in December 2012, hitting the lowest year-end level in the last 44
years. The relatively favorable course of unprocessed food prices were the major determinant of
the fall in inflation. The stable course of the exchange rate, slowing economic activity and falling
annual core goods inflation also contributed positively to the inflation outlook. Going forward,
inflation is forecast to stay within the Central Bank’s target range. Achieving price stability will
be critical to preventing excessive real effective exchange rate appreciation in the long run.

23.     The growth path projected incorporates the expected impact of structural reforms,
consistent with the Government’s reform program. The growth projections are underpinned
by the implementation of ongoing reforms (including moving forward decisively with reforms to
improve the business climate and full implementation of the new commercial code – discussed in
more detail in the next section of this Document). Progress in these areas is a must to increase
the country’s productivity and competitiveness and to attract more FDI. Reforms to increase the
flexibility of the labor market, promote female and youth employment, and boost private
investment in infrastructure are also on the agenda and could boost Turkey’s sustainable growth
rate beyond the baseline forecast.

24.     Turkey’s dependence on external financing remains the main risk to the economic
outlook, but downside and upside risks are evenly balanced in 2013. Turkey’s external
financing needs over the coming five years are high due to the country’s large current account
deficit (Table 3). In addition, the composition of its financing remains a critical concern even as
inflows of FDI are expected to increase in part due to an envisaged acceleration of privatization.
Under a scenario of deepened crisis in the Eurozone including a global liquidity squeeze, Turkey
could face significantly lower growth or even a GDP contraction. On the other hand, a global

economic upswing in 2013 presents an upside risk to the baseline in the short term, but through
rising global interest rates could also complicate macroeconomic management for Turkey
beyond 2013.

25.     External debt to GDP ratio may increase significantly in case of a severe shock but,
even in such a scenario, the external debt dynamics may still remain sustainable. After
declining considerably from 56.2 percent in 2002 to 35.4 percent in 2005, external debt stood at
42.8 percent at end-2012 and is forecast to ease to 41.7 percent by end-2017 in the baseline
scenario (Figure 7). However, the external debt sustainability analysis shows that, in the event of
a sudden stop of capital flows in the first quarter of 2013, the external debt to GDP ratio could
rise from 42.8 percent to almost 48.5 percent in 2015 with more moderate increases thereafter.
This sharp increase would mostly stem from TL depreciation while the decline in GDP would
also push the debt to GDP ratio higher. It should be noted that a sudden stop scenario must be
considered highly hypothetical in current circumstances and is used to illustrate that even in this
case, external debt dynamics are not on an unsustainable path.

26.     The public debt sustainability analysis suggests that the risks to the sustainability of
Turkey’s debt burden are moderate in the baseline scenario. Under the baseline
macroeconomic scenario, gross public debt is forecast to decline from 39.7 percent of GDP at
end-2012 to 36.5 percent of GDP by 2015 (Figure 8). However, in an extreme downside
scenario, domestic interest rates would go up, the exchange rate would depreciate, GDP would
contract, and fiscal performance would deteriorate similar to post 2008 period. As a result, the
public debt to GDP ratio would rise in 2013 before resuming its downward trend and declining to
41.2 percent by 2017.

27.     Overall, Turkey’s macroeconomic framework is adequate for the proposed
operation. Turkey remains vulnerable to a slowdown of capital inflows due to its high reliance
on external financing. Accordingly, the current account deficit and external debt dynamics are
being closely monitored with the macro framework aiming to balance the risk of a foreign credit
fuelled boom-bust cycle against the need to sustain some domestic momentum in uncertain

global circumstances. Turkey’s key structural strengths, primarily its resilient banking sector,
dynamic private sector, and favorable public and external debt dynamics mitigate risks to the
economy and suggest a favorable medium-term outlook for Turkey.

   III.    THE GOVERNMENT’S PROGRAM AND PARTICIPATORY PROCESSES

28.     The Government has set ambitious development goals for Turkey to meet in the
next decade. Turkey intends to be one of the world’s ten largest economies by 2023 – the
centenary of the founding of the Turkish Republic. The Government’s 2023 targets aim for a
GDP of USD 2 trillion, exports of more than USD 500 million and per capita incomes of USD
25,000. Turkey also aims to complete accession negotiations with the EU, further develop
Istanbul as a leading financial hub, and become the leading manufacturing and service provider
both in the region and beyond.

29.     Fully unleashing Turkey’s growth potential over the medium term will require
continued structural reform bolstering competitiveness and boosting domestic savings thus
lowering external vulnerabilities over time. Competitiveness in Turkey remains plagued by a
relative burdensome business environment, which negatively impacts productivity, exports, and
inflows of FDI. Informality remains prevalent, posing not only a potential growth constraint but
also resulting in lower saving rates. Further reforms to deepen the financial sector (which
remains dominated by banks) would provide greater access to financial services; thus,
encouraging domestic savings and access to longer term funding, including for small- and
medium-size enterprises (SMEs).

30.     Improving firm productivity and competitiveness is an important priority for the
authorities. Turkey ranked 71st in the 2013 Doing Business rankings. It performs lowest on
dealing with construction permits (142),          Figure 9: Turkey ranks higher than the EU-27

starting a business (72), and protecting
investors (70) (Figure 9). Analysis of Business
Environment and Enterprise Performance
Survey (BEEPS) IV firm-level data in
particular reveals that SMEs in Turkey grow
more slowly than other firms, both in terms of
employment and in terms of revenue. This is in
contrast to what is observed in many other
countries, where SMEs grow faster than large
firms, and points to an investment climate
where SMEs face barriers to their expansion
that force them to remain at a smaller (and Source: 2013 Doing Business Report
suboptimal) scale of operations. In addition,




                                                12
SMEs in Turkey are, on average, older. 5 This is especially true for medium-sized firms, with 60
percent in Turkey being more than 16 years old, compared to 20 percent in the EU-10,
suggesting that obstacles in Turkey remain significant.

31.     Deepening and broadening financial markets to improve access and promote the
availability of longer-term finance is another important policy consideration for the
Authorities. Access to finance appears to be the single most important constraint to SME
growth. Turkey’s financial system has deepened since the 2001 crisis, with financial system
assets amounting to 147 percent of GDP in 2011. 6 The share of the non-bank financial sector
has nevertheless declined to 12.9 percent by the end of 2011, despite the growing number and
variety of non-bank financial institutions (NBFI). The new CML and NBFI law will lay the
legal basis for orderly growth of these sectors. A strengthened Credit Registry is expected to be
operational by mid-2013 (Box 3).

                                          Box 3: A New Credit Registry 7
Credit bureaus help alleviate the information asymmetry between lenders and borrowers by providing cost
effective systematic information on potential borrowers. Empirical evidence confirms that private credit
registries are associated with a higher share of bank financing. 8 In relation to small firms, the existence of a credit
bureau is associated with a lower degree of financing constraints and credit bureaus are associated with a higher
likelihood of obtaining a loan. Credit bureaus also reduce credit risk because the negative impact of default on the
firms’ credit history is an added cost of defaulting.

Turkey has a public registry covering both individuals and enterprises as well as a private credit registry,
covering only individuals. The Central Bank operates a credit registry that covers both individuals and firms above
a small threshold and provides only information at a point in time. Information includes outstanding exposures,
whether they are in default, and basic information such as amount and maturity. A group of large banks have
established the Credit Bureau of Turkey (KKB), which collects information about consumer credit. KKB collects
both positive and negative information, but only on consumer credit; it does not collect information about firms’
credit history.

With the aim to improve credit bureau implementation in Turkey, the credit registry operated by the Central
Bank was transferred to the Bankers Association of Turkey by Law no. 6111 passed on February 13, 2011.
Implementing legislation was issued by the Bankers Association and published in the Official Gazette on April 10,
2012. The new center established under the Bankers Association aims to improve the depth of credit information
belonging to firms and individuals. Not only banks but also NBFIs (leasing, factoring, consumer finance, etc.) will
be members and provide information to the system. Both positive and negative credit data will be available.
Legislation is providing the framework for collecting credit information from other institutions beyond the members,
such as utility companies or government authorities by signing a resource protocol.

32.     In parallel, the Authorities are trying to further improve enterprise governance to
boost competitiveness and enhance Turkey’s potential to bring in FDI inflows. The adoption
of the Commercial Code, which in essence provides a completely new and modern “constitution?
for private sector commercial activity and entrepreneurship, grounded in financial transparency

and strengthened corporate governance, is the cornerstone of Turkey’s recent business climate
and competitiveness reforms. Further steps to reduce red tape particularly for SMEs are
underway. For instance, the number of steps to start up a business was recently reduced further,
and has now fallen from 14 in 2004 to 5 in 2012.

33.    However, the new Commercial Code also raises Turkey’s minimum capital
requirement for starting a business, going against best practice. Since 2005, 57 countries
have reduced or eliminated their minimum capital requirement, lowering the average paid-in
minimum capital requirement globally from 184 percent of income per capita to 49 percent,
according to the World Bank’s Doing Business report. A high minimum capital requirement
limits market competition and may drive firms into informality. Moreover, recovery rates in
bankruptcy are no higher in economies with             Figure 10: Informal Competition

without. 9 In addition, the requirements may

entrepreneurship. By proposing increases in
the minimum capital requirement, Turkey is
going against international best practice.

34.     Improving the business environment
will help the fight against informality. In
Turkey, the underreporting of revenues and
wages and the non-registration of workers with
the social security system are the most
important forms of informality, while fully Source: World Bank Enterprise Surveys

total number of firms. Informality in Turkey is
widespread along the value chain. 11 According to the latest available Enterprise Survey data,
firms in Turkey that identify practices of competitors in the informal sector as a major constraint
to their own operations is somewhat higher than in most comparator countries (Figure 10).
Improving the business environment, including through measures supported by this operation, by
making formalization less costly and more attractive, will complement the efforts towards
reducing informality.

35.    While informality has declined in recent years, further progress in this area remains
a priority for the authorities. Informal employment declined from 43.5 percent in 2008 to 42.1
percent in 2011, helped by government policies towards formalization. The first action plan
towards combating informality was issued in 2009 and renewed in 2011. It aims to increase tax
payer compliance, strengthen audit capacity, improve enforcement, share databases among
agencies, and create awareness about the consequences of informality. Since 2012, the Revenue
Administration has issued on its website the implementation status of the Action Plan.

36.     Increasing domestic saving is critical for promoting sustainability of growth in
Turkey and is a key policy objective of the government. The widening saving-investment gap
starting in the early 2000s was increasingly financed by external savings (Figure 11). Turkey has
experienced a significant decline in its domestic saving rates over the last decade, driven by a
reduction in the private saving rates while public saving increased through most of the period.
The domestic saving rate declined from an average of 23.5 percent of GDP in the 1990s to an
average of 17 percent over the 2000-2008 period, and further to 13.5 percent in 2010 (before
increasing to 14.4 percent in 2011). In addition to the reform of private pensions as well as
measures to deepen financial markets and support medium-term investment products, achieving
this objective will require improvements in the structural fiscal balance, and continued efforts to
tackle informality and the female labor force participation rate.

37.     Structural reforms will need to continue over the medium term to facilitate
Turkey’s growth to high-income status. A significant agenda remains in alleviating some of
the most binding constraints to doing business,
                                                              Figure 11: Domestic Saving Rate
including in resolving insolvency and in dealing                     (in percent of GDP)
with construction permits, further reducing
informality along the value chain, and
improving access to finance. In this context,
strengthening     micro-finance      and     fully
operationalizing the credit registry are
important areas that will disproportionately
benefit smaller firms. In order to ensure
sustainability of growth, excessive reliance on
foreign financing will need to decline and hence
reforms to promote domestic savings will
continue to be important, including a sound
private pension scheme, deeper capital markets
providing longer term funding, and continued Source: Ministry of Development
development of NBFIs. Steps towards increasing the flexibility of the labor market also remain
important and will lead to greater job creation by enhancing the business climate and improving
worker productivity. Finally, as the potential for productivity growth through technology
absorption and through structural change declines, Turkey will need to further boost the
country’s innovation capacity. While public research and development (R&D) spending has been
increased significantly in the past decade, this has not so far been accompanied by a sharp rise in
private sector R&D. World class national innovation systems tend to use public funding to
catalyze private sector innovation and strengthen the links between scientific research and
entrepreneurship and Turkey could learn from world leaders in this field.

38.    The government’s new development plan for 2014-2018 is expected to articulate the
main development challenges and policy priorities towards making Turkey one of the top
ten economies in the world. While this operation is being undertaken in the last year of the
current development plan, preparations for the tenth Plan are well advanced. The new Plan is
envisaged to continue to focus on key reform areas supported by this operation, while presenting
a new vision for second generation reforms.




                                                15
PARTICIPATORY PROCESSES

39.     The Authorities have carried out consultations with stakeholders on each of the
policy reforms supported by this operation. Turkey has its own participatory processes
underpinning policy formulation. Government policy is informed by regular consultation with
stakeholders in varied forums. Groups involved in this process include unions, employer
organizations, chambers of commerce and industry, civil society organizations, academics, and
private sector representatives. In the case of long-term policy formulation in strategic areas, the
Government uses the preparation of the development plan as a consultation platform. In the
context of the proposed operation, ad-hoc special committees have been established on savings
and competitiveness as part of the next Development Plan. Improving investment climate
activities has been conducted since 2001 under the platform of the Coordination Council for the
Improvement of the Investment Environment (YOIKK).

40.     The legislative process in Turkey requires ensuring participation of all public
stakeholders during the preparation of any draft legislation. In the case of comprehensive
reforms, such as the Commercial Code, the government undertakes a series of consultations with
all relevant stakeholders. Involvement of academia and relevant public institutions are
sometimes secured through establishing a steering committee for preparation of draft legislative
changes. In the case of Commercial Code, the Government undertook a very extensive
consultation process by bringing all stakeholders including the private sector, academia and
NGOs on board.

             IV.    BANK SUPPORT TO THE GOVERNMENT’S PROGRAM

LINK TO CPS

41.      The proposed DPL is central to the Bank’s engagement in Turkey, as emphasized in
the 2012-2015 CPS. It advances the outcomes under Pillar I, sustaining macroeconomic and
financial sustainability and enhancing competitiveness and employment. The DPL will
contribute to the following expected CPS outcomes under the competitiveness pillar:
(i) sustained macroeconomic and financial stability and strengthened exports, domestic savings,
and external resilience; (ii) improved investment and business climate; deepened and broadened
access to finance.

42.     At the time of the CPS, it had been envisaged that reforms supported by this
operation would include measures in support of implementation of the National
Employment Strategy. The Authorities have chosen to prioritize reforms in the area of
domestic savings, financial markets and specific components of the investment climate – ahead
of regulatory measures to help address labor market rigidities. Severance pay reform is currently
particularly contentious, while there is more support to move forward in other areas including
more flexible contracting. As outlined in Box 4, employment outcomes in Turkey have been
favorable since the global economic crisis.




                                                16
                              Box 4: Post-Crisis Employment Generation in Turkey
In the period after the 2008 crisis, Turkey has experienced a remarkable increase in employment,
particularly among women. Employment has been growing at an outstanding 5.3 percent per annum over the
2010-2012 period (8 percent among women), resulting in employment rates that are about 5 percentage points
higher than in the fourth quarter of 2008. The strong recovery of employment is explained by both rising labor force
participation and falling unemployment, which is now one percentage points lower than the average pre-crisis level.
The employment surge has mainly come from services and formal employment and benefited university graduates
(both for men and women, although women have also experienced a significant increase in informal agricultural
employment). A sizable part of the increase in employment is also due to people staying longer in the labor force.

While more detailed analytical work on the causes of the employment surge is underway, it may indicate
structural changes in the labor market and a number of policies may have contributed to this change. Rapid
economic growth after the crisis is partly behind the surge in employment, but the increase in the employment-to-
growth elasticity (from 0.18 in the 2002-2007 growth period to 0.72 in the period after the crisis) suggests there is
more to it than the speed of recovery. Possible reasons include supply factors, as improved education levels and
rising costs of living in urban areas push women to look for employment, as well as demand factors, such as the
October 2008 targeted reduction in employers’ social security contribution for women and youth employees.


COLLABORATION WITH THE IMF AND OTHER DONORS

43.     The Bank has coordinated closely with the IMF on this program. The IMF’s most
recent Stand-By Arrangement for Turkey was completed successfully in May 2008. The latest
Article IV was completed in November 2012 and whilst giving the authorities credit for the soft
landing achieved, it also points to remaining risks and vulnerabilities, including the need to boost
domestic savings and external competitiveness. The staff of the World Bank and IMF
collaborated closely, with exchanges on macroeconomic, fiscal, and structural reforms. The
IMF’s Public Information Notice issued on November 20, 2012, following 2012 Article IV
Consultation with Turkey, is attached as Annex 4.

44.     The European Commission (EC) and the World Bank launched an initiative in
December 2010 seeking to increase opportunities for synergies in working with the Turkish
Authorities. Areas of close collaboration include energy sector reforms, female employment, the
business climate and foreign trade. The World Bank also maintains a close dialogue and
collaboration with United Nations Children's Fund (UNICEF) and United Nations Development
Program (UNDP) in Turkey. Within IBRD, the World Bank and the International Finance
Corporation (IFC) maintain a close dialogue including energy, transport and private and financial
sector development areas. In particular, World Bank (2012) was prepared in close consultation
with IFC and, informed the discussions on the CML. 12 IFC and the World Bank also cooperated
closely on the dialogue on the Leasing Law.

RELATIONSHIP TO OTHER BANK OPERATIONS

45.     The proposed CSDPL is a natural continuation of the IBRD’s prior lending
engagement in Turkey. This operation deepens the structural reform agenda supported under
the Programmatic Public Sector Development Policy Loan (PPDPL)/Restoring Equitable Growth
and Employment Development Policy Loan (REGE DPL) series, and particularly builds on the
last loan of this series which was presented to the Board on May 5, 2011. It takes forward efforts

to improve the climate for business growth, productivity and enterprise governance, through,
inter alia, follow-up on the Commercial Code, the new Civil Procedures Law (CPL) and the new
CML. In private sector development, the policy measures supported by the proposed program
complement the Bank’s lending to SMEs and exporters through its credit line facilities. 13 The
proposed program has also been complemented by a programmatic series of DPLs focusing on
environmentally sustainable development and the energy sector, with the last loan in this series
presented to the Board on March 27, 2012.

LESSONS LEARNED

46.     The proposed operation has incorporated lessons from the Bank’s experience in
Turkey to date. As in previous DPLs, analytical work and policy financing have been fully
integrated, including a mix of local knowledge and international experience from the Bank (see
next Section).

47.     Experience with programmatic lending in Turkey also points to the importance of
continuity in program design, mirroring the Government’s rolling medium-term
programs. The programmatic structuring of work, combining knowledge and lending
operations, is particularly effective. However, the Bank’s existing exposure framework limits
the scope for a multi-year programmatic DPL engagement in Turkey, and in consultation with
the authorities, it was, therefore, decided to make this operation more focused and to process it
on a stand-alone basis. This should also facilitate monitoring and evaluation (M&E), as well as
communication among the different stakeholders.

ANALYTICAL UNDERPINNINGS

48.     The proposed DPL program rests on extensive analytical and advisory work
undertaken by the World Bank. This work underpins not only the policy areas, but also the
specific prior actions covered by the proposed operation (Table 4).

                                      V.       THE PROPOSED OPERATION

OPERATION DESCRIPTION

49.    The policy program supported by the proposed operation has been closely aligned
with the strategic priorities of the Government and supports selectively key elements of the
Ninth Development Plan and the 2013-2015 Medium-Term Program. These program areas




                                                                20
were chosen in view of their importance, informed by economic and sector work conducted
jointly with the Government, and their strong relationship to CPS objectives.

50.     The proposed operation will be a single tranche stand-alone DPL. The Bank's
existing exposure framework does not enable a multi-year programmatic DPL engagement in
Turkey and the Authorities are currently in the final year of the Ninth Development Plan. In case
revisions are made to the Bank's exposure framework, the medium-term agenda outlined in this
Document is expected to be part of a policy dialogue under future potential DPL engagements in
the context of the Tenth Development Plan. An indicative medium-term reform agenda has been
identified and will form the subject of continued Bank policy engagement, including and subject
to revisions of the Bank’s exposure framework for Turkey through subsequent Development
Policy Lending (paragraph 37).

51.     The objective of the program supported by the proposed Euro 624.1 million (USD
800 million equivalent) operation is to facilitate Turkey’s growth to high-income status by
bolstering competitiveness and boosting domestic savings, thus reducing external
vulnerabilities over the medium term. The specific reforms to be supported by the operation
are organized around two pillars: (i) bolstering competitiveness via an improved business
environment and better governance; and (ii) boosting domestic savings and deepening the
financial sector.

52.    The remainder of this section presents the policy areas and actions supported by the
proposed operation. It outlines the expected prior actions and their projected impact on the
economy. Table 5 summarizes the prior actions and their current status.

POLICY AREAS

Policy Area I: Bolstering competitiveness via an improved business environment and better
governance

53.     The business environment and enterprise governance pillar supports the objective
of increasing the overall productivity of the Turkish economy by promoting entry and
openness of the economy. The CSDPL supports three key measures in this area:
(i) implementing the Commercial Code; (ii) improving the investment climate; and (iii) reducing
informality.

PRIOR ACTION: Critical Secondary Regulations to implement the Commercial Code have been
issued, including legislation on the trade registry system, scope of independent audits, minimum
requirements for annual activity reports, rules and procedures for undertaking general assembly
meetings and the electronic general assembly system.

54.     The implementation of a new Commercial Code is the cornerstone of Turkey’s
recent business climate and competitiveness reforms. It provides a completely new and
modern “constitution? for private sector commercial activity and entrepreneurship, grounded in
financial transparency and strengthened corporate governance. Strong corporate governance
helps firms attract investment, improves private sector productivity and strengthens a country’s
financial stability. Through high levels of transparency and accountability in business


                                               21
procedures, as well as improved monitoring of financial flows and firm performance, an
economy can increase access to external financing by attracting investors; develop a more
prosperous stock market, improve operational performance; reduce risk of financial crises; and
build better relationships among all stakeholders in a firm.

55.     The new Commercial Code (no. 6102) came into effect on July 1, 2012. It was
published in the Official Gazette on February 14, 2011, and a number of amendments were
published in the Official Gazette on June 30, 2012. 14 Secondary legislation has subsequently
been prepared and entered into force on January 1st, 2013. The amended provisions of the new
Code are expected to bring the legislation in line with EU norms and improve standards of
financial disclosure, particularly for large corporate groups, as well as the rights of shareholders.
The new Code will introduce important rules and concepts to the corporate governance
framework in Turkey, with an approach based on four pillars, namely:

       •   Transparency, with the Code promoting transparency in financial statements, board of
           directors’ annual reports, and independent audits. A Trade Registry regulates activities of
           all companies after facilitating their registration with the Chambers of Trade and
           Industry. All registry certificates are kept in electronic form and data about registered
           companies are available to the public.
       •   Accountability, with the Code moving towards compliance with International
           Accounting Standards and introducing independent Board members. Responsibility has
           been regulated in parallel with accountability.
       •   Regulatory innovation, with the Code introducing simpler incorporation procedures,
           regulating the conversion of companies, allowing for a single Board member and
           shareholder, and regulating electronic commerce.
       •   Fairness, with the Code establishing a balance of interests and expanding rights of
           minority stakeholders. Shareholder rights (rights to sue, to gather information, and to
           inspect) have been enhanced, minority rights have been enriched and privileged shares
           have been restricted.
56.    While these measures will all improve the investment climate over the medium
term, there are a few changes that are expected to have significant impact on investment
decisions, even in the shorter term. First, the new enhanced reporting (and disclosure)
requirements will deal with a major identified constraint to access to finance. Second, the new
measures to enhance investor protection should have an impact on both domestic and foreign
investment – as does the new provision allowing for a single / shareholder member. The
Document below focuses on these two areas, which have been the focus of the dialogue between
the World Bank and the Authorities.


14
     Amendments were intended to facilitate implementation of the Code, including by extending the deadline for
     some of the changes (the time granted for amending the articles of association was for instance extended to
     twelve months as of the effectiveness date of the new Code, i.e. July 1, 2013) and limiting the application of
     some of the new measures (the requirement obliging all capital stock companies to open a website was for
     instance limited to capital stock companies subject to independent auditing). Regulations concerning criminal
     liabilities have also been reconsidered and in some cases administrative fines have replaced judicial fines and
     prison sentences.


                                                         22
57.     The scope and implementation of TFRS has increased on January 1, 2013, following
the implementation of the new Commercial Code. The amendments made to the Commercial
Code in June 2012 assigned the responsibility to determine which companies will prepare
financial statements in accordance with TFRS and the timetable for its implementation to
POAASB. As published in the Official Gazette on November 17, 2012, public interest
companies as defined by decree law 660 15 and those that are defined in the article 1534 16 of the
Commercial Code as well as the companies that are subject to external audit as per the Decree of
the Council of Ministers are required to apply TFRS in their financial statements prepared for
financial years after January 1, 2013.

                                      Box 5: SOEs and the Commercial Code
Starting from 2015, SOEs and their affiliates under the Undersecretariat of Treasury’s portfolio will be
subject to the independent audit framework. According to the Decree of the Council of Ministers dated January
23, 2013, SOEs and their affiliates meeting at least two of the following three criteria for two consecutive years will
be subject to independent audit from 2015 as well as to the existing Turkish Court of Accounts (TCA) audit; (i) total
assets more than TL 40 million, (ii) net turnover more than TL 50 million, and (iii) number of employees more than
125.

SOEs will be required to prepare their financial reports in line with the Turkish Accounting Standards (TAS)
equivalent to the International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) starting from 2015. Currently, the
financial statements produced by most SOEs operating under decree law are taking steps to make their financial
statements compatible with IFRS.

SOEs governed under decree law 233 are subject to audit by the TCA. They may also be inspected or audited
by the Undersecretariat of Treasury or the line ministry. TCA audit focuses on compliance and procedural
issues as well as on technical and performance related areas. Its reports are submitted to the Grand National
Assembly, and, in some cases, to the public. Only state owned banks, and SOEs that receive lending or on-lending
from international institutions, like the World Bank, are regularly audited by independent external auditors.

Meeting these new requirements, entails additional capacity building at the enterprise level and the Bank has
been working with the Undersecretariat of Treasury on an SOE governance benchmarking study. As part of
this technical assistance (TA) work, piloting of improving corporate governance structures, including accounting
and financial reporting in line with the new Commercial Code at two SOEs, will be undertaken.



58.     The Decree of the Council of Ministers published in the Official Gazette on January
23, 2013 has widened the scope of companies that are subject to external audit. 17 In addition
to the companies that are already audited, SOEs, companies with more than 25 percent public
ownership, companies publishing national newspapers, companies under the oversight of Energy
Market Regulatory Agency with total assets, turnover and number of employees more than the


15
   Public interest entities are defined as quoted companies, banks, insurance and pension fund companies, factoring
   companies, financing companies, financial leasing companies, asset management companies, retirement funds,
   companies defined as public interest by the POAASB.
16
   These companies are those that fall under the definition of large size companies as per the decree of the Ministry
   of Customs and Trade and those small- and medium-sized enterprises which are in the process of issuing bonds,
   which have safekeeping functions like banks, investment banks and insurance companies. Additionally article
   1534 includes companies that are subject to the CMB Law, Banking Law, Insurance Law and Pension Fund Law.
17
   Companies fulfilling two of the following three criteria for two consecutive years are subject to audit from 2013
   onwards; (i) total assets more than TL 150 Million, (ii) net turnover more than TL 200 Million and (iii) number of
   employees more than 500.


                                                          23
defined criteria for each group have been brought under the umbrella of audit (Box 5).18
However, even though the Council of Ministers Decree has broadened the scope of external
audit, small and medium sized companies have remained outside the audit requirement. Three
communiqués published in January 2013 define the details of training requirements, licensing,
and registry of independent auditors, and also provide further clarification on the qualifications
and accreditation requirements. 19

59.     The Public Oversight, Accounting and Auditing Standards Board (POAASB), a key
institution for the implementation of the accounting and auditing 20 clauses of the
Commercial Code, was established in November 2011. The POAASB has become the
centralized body responsible for the preparation and publication of Turkish Accounting and
Auditing Standards 21 as well as the licensing and oversight of auditors. 22 The current set of
Turkish Financial Reporting Standards (TFRS) is fully aligned with the International Financial
Reporting Standards. 23 The TAS, to be aligned with the International Standards on Auditing as
per decree law 660, is not yet published. 24 Working commissions composed of practitioners are
working on the TAS and POAASB plans to publish them by mid-2013. POAASB published the
independent audit communiqué defining the independent audit activities, licensing of auditors,
and establishment of auditors` registry on December 26, 2012.

60.     Improved investor protection, considering director liability and the possibility of
bringing shareholder suits, should increase investment going forward. Doing Business
measures the strength of minority shareholder protection against directors’ misuse of corporate
assets for personal gain. 25 Table 6 shows that Turkey still does not hold directors adequately
liable in the case of transactions that were unfair, oppressive or prejudicial to minority
shareholders as well as when requiring beneficiaries to return excess profits realized through
unfair transactions. Turkey also scores lower than most comparator economies in the
possibilities for shareholders to pursue lawsuits, because it does not allow shareholders with less

18
   These companies are defined in List 1 of the Council of Ministers Decree and consist of mostly companies subject
    to the CML, Banking Law, Insurance Law, those that are licensed to operate in Istanbul Gold Exchange,
    agricultural products licensed storage companies and national satellite and cable TV media companies.
19
    POAASB accredited auditors have to be certified public accountants (CPAs) or sworn-in certified public
    accountants (SCPAs) licensed by the Union of Chambers of Certified Public Accountants and Sworn-in Certified
    Public Accountants of Turkey (TURMOB) and should additionally pass the independent auditor examination.
    CPAs and SCPAs with more than 15 years of experience are exempt from the independent auditors examination
    but should attend the training programs conducted by the universities accredited by POAASB. Currently,
    POAASB has accredited two universities and is in the process of evaluating the remaining 28 applicants.
20
    According to Article 62 of the Capital Markets Law, the CMB determines additional requirements for the
    authorization of audit firms in capital markets and publishes a list of those who meet such requirements.
21
   The decree law 660 on Establishment and Responsibilities of the Public Oversight, Accounting and Auditing
    Standards Board describes Turkish Accounting Standards as Turkish Accounting Standards and TFRS approved
    by the POAASB.
22
   The current TFRS includes standards that were prepared and issued by the Turkish Accounting Standards Board
    (TASB), which was dissolved by the establishment of the POAASB, as well as those issued by the POAASB.
23
   The POAASB is currently reviewing and integrating updates to the standards and will reissue them under its name
    as TASB is now dissolved. Until they are reissued, the original standards which are available on the POAASB
    web-site are applicable.
24
   TAS refers to Turkish Standards on Auditing, Standard on Quality Control and Code of Ethics.

documents before filing suit.

61.     Shareholder rights have been significantly enhanced, addressing shortcomings
under the previous Law. The position of shareholder is strengthened, with an expansion in
shareholder rights, greater importance given to transparency, and a restriction of privileged
shares. Importantly, each shareholder is now allowed to present a resolution requesting the
investigation of a specific transaction they believe to be fraudulent at the general shareholders
meeting. 26 There is also a provision allowing for single shareholder/board membership which
will promote FDI by effectively eliminating the need to find “straw man? shareholders, while
also allowing smaller single proprietors to grow their company into larger concerns without
having to seek additional shareholders.

PRIOR ACTION: Progress in improving the investment climate, through:
•    issuance of critical secondary legislation to ensure full implementation of the CPL,
     including establishing a procedure for carrying out preliminary investigations before
     court hearings, thereby speeding up court proceedings; and; and
•    issuance of a circular to simplify the registration of businesses.

62.      Turkey’s business climate remains burdensome compared to the EU and the OECD.
The 2010 Investment Climate Assessment, which used BEEPS IV, 2008 - 2009 firm-level survey
data and the most recent set of Doing Business point to a business climate that places onerous
restrictions on companies in Turkey, especially on SMEs. 27 Measures supported by this prior
action so far focus on the following two policy areas: (i) enforcing contracts, and (ii) starting a
business.
26
   As per the Commercial Code made effective July 1, 2012, articles 438 and 439 and further specified in the
   secondary legislation.

63.     The proposed operation supports recent changes and additions to out of court
procedures that make it easier and less costly for businesses to enforce contracts. Efficient
court enforcement has been found to affect investment, with international experience showing
that firms on average tend to have less bank financing for new investment in countries where
courts are slower to enforce contracts. 28 In addition, reforms in other areas, such as creditors’
rights, help increase bank lending only if contracts can be enforced before the courts. Moreover,
in countries with good contract enforcement in debt collection, firms tend to produce and export
relatively more customized products, especially in industries where the continuation of the
relationship is most important. In addition, FDI tends to be greater where the cost of contract
enforcement in debt collection and property eviction is lower.

64.     Improving the quality of contract enforcement will help address informality.
Laeven and Woodruff (2007) show that in Mexico, firm size is increasing with the quality of the
legal system. When firms are better able to enforce contracts, they can depend on the legal
system to regulate anything more than an arm’s length relationship with customers and
suppliers. 29 This meant that there were more benefits and fewer costs to expanding markets and
suppliers. In Turkey, through similar channels, this will likely induce more firms to come out of
the shadows of informality and to formalize their contractual obligations and options.

65.      The CPL speeds up court proceedings by establishing a procedural phase, called
preliminary investigation before court hearings. The new CPL also introduces a modern
administrative legal framework including: (i) procedures to streamline court cases; (ii) new out-
of-court conciliation mechanisms; (iii) a national arbitration system on par with international
good practices; and (iv) new regional civil courts as an intermediate appeals mechanism.
Overall, the law aims to facilitate out-of-court settlements and reduce court workloads and it will
give litigants the opportunity to shorten proceedings and reduce their cost of enforcing contracts.
In addition, the Mediation Law on Civil Disputes which was published in the Official Gazette
dated June 22, 2012 and the secondary legislation of this Law published in the Official Gazette
dated January 26, 2013 has introduced an out-of-court settlement system complementing the
CPL. While the passing of the CPL was supported in the REGE DPL2, this operation supports
the secondary legislation establishing the preliminary investigation before court hearings thus
reducing the workload on judges and facilitating out-of-court settlement mechanisms.

66.     The secondary legislation completes full implementation of these new procedures.
In sum, this reform will lead to less time in court and, once in court, the possibility of speedier
settlements since the investigative phase of the proceedings will have been largely completed
beforehand. The 2013 Doing Business report recorded a reduction in the cost of the legal
proceedings in contract enforcement, but it is likely that in the succeeding years, as a result of
these reforms, there will be a reduction in the time and number of procedures as well.

67.     The proposed operation supports recent procedural simplification that makes
starting a business less burdensome. A growing body of empirical research has highlighted
close links between business entry regulation and social and economic outcomes. Using data

collected from company registries in 100 economies over eight years, analysis found that simple
business start-up is critical for fostering formal entrepreneurship. 30 Cumbersome regulations and
administrative procedures for starting a business are found to be associated with a smaller
number of legally registered firms, greater informality (a finding particularly relevant for many
developing economies), a smaller tax base and more opportunities for corruption. 31 In addition,
formally registered companies have access to services and institutions from courts to banks as
well as to new markets—benefits that are not available to unregistered firms.

68.     On April 4, 2012, the Ministry of Customs and Trade issued a circular to simplify
business registration. This circular reduced the number of procedures to register a business
from six to five by making it unnecessary to present a copy of the identity card and the certificate
of domicile for registration. In addition, the newly formed businesses will no longer need: (a)
the original or a certified hard copy of the trade registry gazette; (b) certified hard copy of the
identity card; (c) a hard copy of the notarized signature circular; (d) a hard copy of the certificate
of domicile or residence permit; and (e) the original or a certified hard copy of the tax
registration certificate that were all required to be submitted when registering at the Chamber of
Commerce.

69.    Once fully implemented, this simplification of procedures will facilitate the use of a
trade registry system that will allow for electronic transactions and keep the records of
economic units in a central database, the Central Registration System Project (MERSIS).
Under MERSIS, various data concerning capital companies, cooperatives, individual enterprises,
branches of foreign companies, enterprises of associations and foundations which are registered
in 237 separate trade registries, will now be transferred to a central electronic database. By the
completion of the project, all company information can be accessed and used by various
government institutions while information will also be shared with other companies within a
confidentiality framework in line with EU rules. The pilot implementation in Mersin has been
carried out since 2010 and the Ministry of Customs and Trade is aiming to launch full
implementation in 2013.

PRIOR ACTION: Further actions taken to reduce informal employment through:
•    increases in the number of Social Security Institution (SSI) auditors to over 1,350
     auditors in December 2012; and,
•    use of risk-based auditing, including the establishment in May 2012 of a Risk Analysis
     Unit within the SSI.

70.     Informality has consequences for productivity as well as for fiscal outcomes, growth,
economic and social vulnerability and social cohesion and the rule of law. Recent studies on
informality among firms argue that informal firms are less productive than formal ones, and that
informality is therefore a potential growth constraint. According to a study on Turkey
(McKinsey, 2003) there is a productivity gap of 30-40 percent between formal and informal
firms. 32 Similarly, Perry et al (2007) argues that the difference in labor productivity between

formal and informal firms is on average about 30 percent for seven Latin American and
Caribbean countries. 33 The empirical analysis in the Turkey CEM on Informality shows that
there is a substantial Total Factor Productivity (TFP) gap between formal and informal firms. 34
The TFP gap between formal and informal firms after controlling for self-selection is 19 percent
in manufacturing and 62 percent in services. There are significant wage gaps between informal
and formal workers even after controlling for selection and individual characteristics. These
differences are likely to be caused by productivity differentials between informal and formal
firm.

71.     Analysis in the context of the CEM on informality suggests that increased and more
coordinated auditing/monitoring of informal economy and employment – making
informality more costly for employers and workers, is one of the key elements of an effective
strategy to address informality. The analysis based on international comparisons, consultations
and survey results in Turkey suggests that frequent and coordinated tax inspections (rather than
the level of rates or tax structure), appear to be key to any formalization effort. Moreover, audits
targeted towards informality could be effective in reducing informal activity and employment.
Increasing audit frequency of those firms or individuals that are more likely to have higher
incomes based on observables can lead to superior outcomes, a measure used in many countries.
Improved coordination, both between auditing units and between the various agencies involved
in efforts to reduce informality, could promote formalization. The CEM also argues that
measures to make informality more costly need to be complemented by measures to make
formalization less costly (particularly to mitigate the potentially adverse effects of the former on
vulnerable groups) as well as by measures to raise awareness about the benefits of formalization
and consequences of informality.

72.     The proposed operation supports recent government actions to reduce the size of the
informal economy and create a level playing field among firms. The first Action Plan
towards combating informality was issued in early 2009 and renewed in 2011. In line with the
recommendation in the CEM on informality of an integrated policy approach, the action plan
covers a variety of sectors, is multi-faceted and implemented by multiple government agencies.
The Action Plan, led by Revenue Administration, aims to increase tax payer compliance,
strengthen audit capacity, improve enforcement, share databases among agencies, and create
awareness about the consequences of informality. A Prime Ministry Circular issued in
December 2011 established a new ministerial-level Supervisory Committee. Moreover, since the
beginning of 2012, the Revenue administration has issued on its website the implementation
status of the Action Plan on a quarterly basis.

73.    The quantity and quality of social security audits has improved. The share of staff
which is assigned to auditing and enforcement in Turkey has been relatively low by international
standards and inspections have not been targeted towards detecting informality (CEM, 2010). As
part of its wide-ranging efforts to reduce informality in all stages of the value chain, and to
complement the earlier five percentage points cut in the social security premium (non-wage labor
cost) which incentivized formalization by making it less costly, the government has aimed to

strengthen its audit capacity and targeting. In particular, SSI has strengthened its auditing
capacity by increasing the number of auditors to 1367 by end -2012 from 700 in 2010 and 1100
in 2011. Moreover, a risk analysis unit was established in SSI in May 2012, with a view to
identify the high risk groups and launch targeted audits towards these groups. The audits aim at
both identifying “unregistered employees? and underreporting of wages and salaries. In 2012, a
number of professional groups (including premier league football, basketball and volleyball
players as well as medical doctors in private practice) have been audited. In 2013, SSI’s targeted
audits will expand to four new groups: private practices of lawyers and engineers as well as road
transport and private schools. These targeted audits will also make use of a “benchmark pay?
method of identifying risk levels. For example, after receiving information from workplaces on
reported salaries (for the purposes of calculating social security premiums) of engineers,
workplaces reporting their employees below a certain threshold will be subject to audit.

74.      The coordination among different auditing agencies is expected to improve further.
As of January 1, 2013, the authorities have introduced a unified audit form among audits of the
Ministry of Finance (MOF) and of the SSI. Currently, the provincial directorates of these
agencies are manually sharing the audit reports with each other. SSI, upon identifying
unregistered workers based on MOF audits, will register these workers ex-officio, without
initiating an additional audit. In the medium-term, it is expected that information sharing will be
done electronically.

75.     As a result of the risk based audits, the audit recovery rate is expected to increase
(from an estimated 6 percent in 2012 to 7 percent in 2013). In the medium-term, successful
implementation of risk-based audits will lead to higher efficiency and ultimately less need for
expanding the quantity of audits. Going forward, the SSI aims also to introduce an M&E system
to monitor the impact of the audits on the firms/establishments and the workers, and modify
policies as necessary to achieve more effective implementation.

Policy area II: Boosting domestic savings and deepening the financial sector.

76.     The domestic savings and capital markets pillar supports the objective of raising the
domestic saving rate and deepening financial intermediation. The CSDPL supports three key
measures in this area: (i) restructuring the private pension scheme through enactment of law no.
6327 and commencing implementation following the issuance of the secondary legislation;
(ii) enactment of a new leasing, factoring and companies legislation; and (iii) enactment of a new
CML.

PRIOR ACTION: Enactment of a law amending the private pension law which aims to improve
incentives for voluntary retirement savings; thus, making savings longer term, following the
issuance of private pension implementing regulations by the Undersecretariat of Treasury.

77.   The decline in the private saving rate since 2001 resulted mostly from increased
household confidence as macroeconomic risks declined, much improved opportunities to
borrow, and a surge in international capital flow to Turkey. The domestic saving rate in
Turkey declined significantly in the 2000s driven by a drop in private saving, offsetting the




                                                29
improvement in public savings throughout much of this period. 35 While the economy was
growing fast, the positive impact of income growth on savings was more than offset by an
acceleration of private consumption stimulated by the increased availability of credit, a fall in
interest rates and pent-up consumption demand. As the economy normalized and interest rates
and inflation declined, so did household precautionary motives for saving. Eventually, however,
continued economic stability and implementation of reforms discussed below should encourage
saving by raising incomes.

78.     A low domestic saving rate adversely affects Turkey’s growth prospects by making
the country dependent on volatile external capital flows. Cross-country data—especially for
developing countries—suggest a positive association between saving, investment, and growth
despite of increasing global capital mobility. Moreover, low domestic savings and the associated
rise in the current account deficit have exposed Turkey to the risk of sudden capital reversals.
This increases uncertainty, makes growth volatile and as a result is likely to reduce investment
horizons and hence medium-term growth prospects.

79.     The proposed operation supports the Government’s efforts to increase domestic
savings and lengthen the maturity of saving
instruments to improve the financing and                  Figure 12: Pension Fund Assets, 2009
                                                                  (in percent of GDP)
sustainability of growth. Private pension
reform can contribute to increasing private
savings, as articulated in the World Bank CEM
on domestic savings (footnote 35). Although
the private pension scheme has grown
considerably since its inception a decade ago,
its assets are still low. As a percentage of GDP,
the Turkish pension system is one of the
smallest among developed and major emerging
market countries (Figure 12). There have been a
number of challenges in expanding the existing
scheme. These include exceptionally high
administrative charges and high rates of early Source: OECD Global Pension Statistics
withdrawal in part due to a lack of alternative medium-term savings products.

80.     The Government launched a reform of private pensions with the enactment in June
2012 of the law restructuring the private pension system (law no. 6327). The law replaces
tax incentives, which favored potentially higher income groups, with a direct government
matching mechanism of 25 percent of contributions (capped at the annual gross minimum wage).
The matching mechanism aims to lengthen the maturity of the savings in the system:
beneficiaries cannot access the matching contributions during the first three years and have only
partial access until retirement age. The law also introduces charge caps to help tackle the
problem of high fees. Still, Turkey will remain one of the highest cost places in the world for
pension saving, and restructuring the sector will be important over the medium term. Following

     This section draws on World Bank, Ministry of Development 2012. Turkey Country Economic Memorandum
     (CEM) on Sustaining High Growth: the Role of Domestic Savings.


                                                   30
the issuance of the secondary regulations by the Undersecretariat of Treasury (as of
December 29, 2012), the law became effective on January 1, 2013.

81.     In the short term, and assuming that it will take time for average contributions and
exit rates to change, the fiscal cost of the new matching system is likely to be approximately
equal to the cost of the previous tax incentive scheme. Currently, the average contribution is
about TL 2,000 a year. The new policy would require a TL 500 annual matching contribution by
the state for each participant. For the 3,000,000 participants in the system, annual matching by
the state would amount to about TL 1.5 billion (USD 795 million or one percent of GDP).
However, there is significant early withdrawal from the system with 28 percent of participants
leaving the system by the end of third year. Since in the new system participants only qualify for
full matching at retirement, the fiscal cost of the new matching scheme is expected to be less
than 25 percent of total contributions in this initial phase.

82.     In the medium term, the reform is expected to change the profile of the private
pension scheme. With the system now in place, it can be expected that fees will start to decline,
early exits will slow down, while participation will go up. In 2013, the first year of
implementation, the fees, as measured by the total daily average charges as a share of daily fund
accumulation, are expected to decline to 3.5 percent from 3.66 percent in 2012. 36 Decline in
early exit rates—as measured by exit within first three years of contract, is expected to decline to
21.2 percent in 2012 to 19 percent in 2013.

83.    Nonetheless, the sustainable growth of the private pension scheme will continue to
face some challenges. Given the failure of a previous mandatory saving scheme in the 1990s,
implementation of the state matching scheme, and in particular the management of the state
contribution accounts, will be challenging and require the government to build credibility over
time. This has motivated the use of generous incentives through the matching scheme. At the
same time, to the extent the scheme is successful the increase in its fiscal cost may create
pressures for a change in current parameters. The premise of the reform is that the increase in
domestic long-term savings available for investment will more than compensate for the fiscal
costs of the scheme through higher growth and tax revenues. Nonetheless, adjustments may be
required as new cohorts of savers enter the system and will need to be carefully managed.

84.      The second important challenge is the continued high level of fees in the system
which reduces the net returns to the participants. In the medium term, increased competition
in the sector, based on investment returns may help ensure a more stable private pension scheme
and also lessen the need for strong fiscal incentives. International experience makes it clear that
it will be important to closely monitor and manage the system, particularly the state contribution
accounts and the fee levels with a view to maintain a declining trend towards international good
practice.

PRIOR ACTION: Enactment of a new CML, which aims to make capital markets deeper, more
competitive and transparent.



36
     This measure is backed up by a requirement that there are no additional or increased fees not covered by those
     included in the 3.5 percent calculation.


                                                         31
85.      At 12.9 percent of GDP in 2012, the size of the NBFIs sector in Turkey remains
small. This in turn suppresses domestic savings, and undermines the availability of (longer-
term) financing thus in turn holding back Turkey’s competitiveness. By providing additional and
alternative financial services, NBFIs improve general system-wide access to finance. They also
help to facilitate longer-term investments and financing, which is often a challenge in the early
stages of bank-oriented financial sector development. The growth of contractual/collective
savings institutions also provides competition for bank deposits, thereby mobilizing long-term
funds necessary for the development of equity and corporate debt markets, municipal bond
markets, mortgage bond markets, leasing, factoring and venture capital. Collective savings
institutions also allow for better risk management, while helping to reduce the potential for
systemic risk through the aggregation of resources.

86.    Comparing with other emerging financial markets reveals that there is significant
potential for financial market

economic growth is sustained and
additional reforms are carried out.

87.    Further development of the corporate bond market, whose capitalization accounted
for only 1 percent of financial market assets in 2012, is crucial for providing more options
for firm financing and household savings. An efficient, deep, and liquid bond market would
provide the corporate sector with alternative options to raise medium- to long-term investment
funds, and it would reduce the corporate sectors’ reliance on external financing and mitigate
associated, maturity, and currency risks. It would also help create a more competitive financial
sector with a lower cost of borrowing and strengthened financial stability. The new CML which
will facilitate innovation and product development, along with an enabling regulatory
framework, will be critical in development of the corporate bond market.

88.     The new CML aims to make capital markets deeper, more competitive, and
transparent. The law – issued in the Official Gazette on December 30, 2012 after years of
preparation – promotes the orderly growth of capital markets and contributes to the efficient
allocation of funds to projects. Key features of the new law include:

    •   Updating the capital market legislation to keep pace with market conditions, global
        developments, and adopting the new standards developed in response to the global
        financial crisis;
    •   Achieving convergence with EU regulations;
    •   Enhancing investor protection;
    •   Facilitating the introduction of new capital markets instruments through a more flexible
        redefinition of securities and derivatives, thereby contributing to increased competition in
        an economy where capital markets are largely dominated by banks;
    •   Strengthening the role of the CMB as a regulator by increasing its regulatory powers and
        extending measures aimed to prevent insider trading and market manipulation;
    •   Introducing new capital markets institutions (such as Management Companies);
    •   Redesigning financial market infrastructures such as Central Clearing Institutions,
        Central Securities Depositories and Trade Repositories in order to reduce systemic risk.
    •   Introducing specialized courts to be authorized in the proceedings related to market
        crimes set forth in the law;
    •   Creating a joint stock company and making the ISE public, and allowing mergers with
        international exchanges, thus enabling the exchange to grow and become more
        sophisticated;
    •   Improving minority shareholders’ rights and corporate governance transparency by
        providing investors appraisal squeeze rights thus encouraging investor interest in
        holding equity investments (for the medium and longer term);
    •   Requiring the implementation of certain corporate governance rules for publicly held
        companies, and extending their implementation in line with capital markets institutions.

89.    The comprehensive and modern framework of the CML is expected to facilitate
market development and innovations without compromising on investor confidence and
market integrity. With the promotion of several new investment vehicles, it is expected that the
CML will introduce increased competition to an economy whose capital markets are largely
dominated by banks. In addition, the new investment vehicles will in turn lead to the
introduction of new lending instruments. This will help better match the supply of capital with
the myriad capital needs that exist.

PRIOR ACTION: Enactment of a Leasing, Factoring and Financing Companies Law, which
aims to contribute to the growth of the NBFIs sector and to improve access to finance, especially
for SMEs.

90.    The Turkish Government is keenly aware of the need to increase the role of the
NBFIs in Turkish financial markets to create an alternative funding source for the
corporate sector and SMEs. Developing leasing allows smaller scale and newer entrepreneurs
to become more economically active by enabling access to finance and subsequently, access to
income-producing assets without a significant base for collateral. Also, leasing offers an


                                                33
important advantage in countries with weak business environments, particularly those with weak
creditors’ rights and collateral laws and registries. Leasing plays a critical role in bringing in
small businesses into the formal financial system as they start building a history of financial
transactions. When the appropriate credit information-sharing infrastructure is in place, banks
and other financial institutions can access these records, better manage risks, and start providing
comprehensive financial services to small businesses.

91.     Parliament enacted a new Leasing, Factoring and Financing Companies Law in
November 2012. The new law collects leasing, factoring and financing company regulations in
one place and aims to establish a reliable legal base for ensuring efficiency and growth of the
NBFI sector. The new law also introduces new leasing types, beyond financial leasing, and
includes provisions to facilitate operational leasing, sub-leasing, software leasing, sell and
leaseback as well as financial leasing transactions to be made from foreign countries. This new
law is expected to help the NBFI sector grow and improve SME’s access to finance especially by
expanding the variety and size of the leasing transactions available for them. In addition, the
new law removes some operational barriers to facilitate leasing transactions and to ensure equal
treatment for Turkish and foreign leasing companies. It removes the minimum contract period
set and lets parties agree on the contract period freely. Finally, the new Law envisages the
establishment of two registries: (i) the first registry will cover leasing contracts and leased
movable assets to protect lessor’s rights and (ii) the second registry is the Central Invoice
Registry System to register invoices, documenting the occurrence of factoring transactions from
the sale of goods or services. 38

92.     The changes introduced by the new Law were developed in consultation with NBFIs
during the past few years. 39 The Government’s new emphasis on a reform program to boost
domestic savings and deepen the financial sector made the enactment of the new Leasing,
Factoring and Financing Companies Law a priority. The sector is still developing from a still
low penetration ratio of 0.67 percent (annual leasing volume as a percentage of GDP) in 2012. 40
This level of penetration is substantially below EU averages (1.86 percent). The new Law will
help the Turkish leasing sector accelerate its development sequentially beyond financial leasing
to evolve towards more complex and diversified leasing structures. 41

93.     The new law provides a strong legal framework and improves the current legislation
especially with respect to the following four areas. First, the law provides revenue
diversification and growth opportunities for leasing companies and SMEs in Turkey. Second,
the law enhances international cooperation and clarifies the legal framework under which these
companies will be coordinated, which should facilitate the flow of longer-term capital into the
system. Third, the law introduces minimum capital limits and transparent shareholding

38
   Previously leased goods were subject to registration by local notaries where the transaction takes place; this
   created an administrative burden and an inefficient registry system. The new Law improves the registry system
   by establishing one reliable and central registry.
39
    These reforms were supported by previous World Bank reports: World Bank, 2003. Non-Bank Financial
   Institutions and Capital Markets in Turkey and World Bank, 2011. Turkey Improving Conditions for SME

   Leasing typically develops through six phases. These phases can be defined as: financial leasing evolving into
   flexible/creative leasing, operational leasing, innovative leasing, the maturity phase and post-maturity phase.


                                                       34
structures, which will improve the sector’s institutionalization. Finally, the law clarifies the legal
framework for disputes and delinquencies and introduces fines for non-compliance with
regulation.

94.    The new Law is an important step in the right direction and welcomed by market
participants with some differences from international practice. The new Law differs from
the Model Law on Leasing adopted by the International Institute for the Unification of the
Private Law (UNIDROIT) and IFC Leasing Guidelines in some areas. Differences are found
mostly in the definition of financial leasing, the tripartite relationship between lessor, lessee and
supplier and the right of the lessee to have direct recourse against the supplier. 42 Going forward,
the World Bank will continue its dialogue with BRSA, the Leasing Association, and other
stakeholders in order to support the further development of the sector.

                                 VI.     OPERATION IMPLEMENTATION

POVERTY AND SOCIAL IMPACTS

95.     The policies and reforms supported by the CSDPL program are expected to have
positive distributional impacts in Turkey. All policy actions supported by the operation are
expected to contribute to higher and sustainable growth, a stronger fiscal position and ultimately
higher living standards over the long term, while specific measures under both pillars are also
likely to have direct and positive distributional impacts over the short-term.

96.    Policy actions supported by the CSDPL aim to reduce Turkey’s wide-spread
informality. Informality – defined as the proportion of workers who are not registered with the
SSI – is most prevalent among the young and older (mostly retired) workers, the less educated,
women, and the poor. More than half of workers aged 15-24 and over 50 are employed
informally. Similarly, over 60 percent of the less educated are informally employed, compared to
50 percent of those with a middle school degree or 28 percent among those with completed
secondary education. For almost all age and education groups, informality among female
workers is higher than among their male counterparts. 43 Finally, informal workers, particularly




42
     Specifically, the differences include: (i) the new law applies accounting (rather than legal) terminology which is
     harder for lawyers and judges to apply. However, the Turkish tax code defines financial leasing in line with
     accounting terminology, and this definition has been used since early 2000s; neither the regulator nor the market
     participants see this as an obstacle in the implementation of the Law. (ii) With respect to the tripartite
     arrangement, this arrangement should reflect the economic nature of leasing as a finance instrument; the lessor is,
     in fact, an intermediary financing agent between the lessee (who needs to acquire an asset) and the supplier (who
     wants to sell it). The Turkish model reflected in the new Law, however, assumes that financial leases can be both
     two and tri-partite in order to make sell and lease back transactions available where there is no supplier.
     (iii) Finally there exists uncertainty as to whether the new Law allows the lessee to have direct recourse against
     the supplier. According to international best practice, legislation should make it clear that the lessee’s rights,
     under the supply agreement, are similar to lessor’s so that the lessee acts and has rights similar to a buyer in
     relation to the supplier (i.e. lessee effectively becomes supplier’s creditor).

those among vulnerable groups, are at higher risk of poverty than other workers because of lower
earnings and lack of protection. 44

97.     Informality increases vulnerability and reduces incentives for women to enter the
labor force. One of the most important and costly consequences of informality is the economic
and social vulnerability of the informally employed and their families. Informal workers lack
access to severance pay and social protection (e.g., unemployment insurance, pensions) and are
therefore less able to cope with income and health shocks. High informality can also weaken
incentives for female labor force participation. Among less educated women, the combination of
widespread informality and a low probability of transitioning to a formal job may act as a
deterrent to participation altogether, while low returns to education (and, more generally, low
wages) in the informal sector can do the same for more educated women.

98.    Policy actions supported by the CSDPL directly tackle the issue of low monitoring
and enforcement, considered as one of the main root causes of informality, by calling for an
increase in the number of SSI inspectors and the adoption of risk-based auditing. The
operation also supports measures aimed at lowering the cost of starting and registering a business
which would reduce the cost of formalization. However, given that only a small fraction of
businesses (less than 5 percent according to the 2008 BEEPS) fail to register in Turkey the
impact of these measures on the incidence of informality is expected to be much more limited.

99.    Higher levels of detection of unregistered workers associated with an increase in the
number of SSI inspectors and the introduction of risk-based auditing will have positive
distributional impacts. A simple calculation suggests that the increase in the number of
inspectors will lead the detection of an additional 2.3 percent unregistered workers and 8.2
percent unregistered businesses every year (see Annex 3 for details). Upon identification
employers are requested to register informal workers with the SSI and, in the absence of
employer action, the agency registers workers ex-officio. A similar process is followed for those
whose wages are underreported. Registration with the SSI will bring these workers under the
umbrella of social protection and allow for severance, unemployment insurance and pension
payments calculations to be made on the basis of their full salary. These benefits will
disproportionately accrue to vulnerable workers who are “over-represented? among those
detected and registered.

100. However, positive distributional impacts could be somewhat smaller than suggested.
Two main factors account for this. First, data and projections from SSI suggest that the number
of informal workers detected has declined over 2008-2010. This decline can be explained mainly
by the fact that once the “low hanging? fruit has been picked, the returns to auditing will be
smaller. Nevertheless, detection in nominal terms has increased in 2011 and more importantly,
the introduction of risk-based auditing is likely to mitigate and possibly reverse this trend by
focusing efforts where detection rates can be the highest. This operation aims to support the
government in increasing the detection rate defined as “the ratio of the workers identified as
unregistered to total number of workers in the workplaces audited.?

101. It is possible for some unregistered workers to lose their employment after
detection. Formalization increases the cost of labor as workers and employers now have to pay
social security contributions and other taxes. If the increase in the cost of a particular worker is
higher than her productivity, the employer is likely to fire her rather than to register her with SSI.
Because vulnerable workers are often the least productive workers there may be a trade-off
between formalization and equity, thus calling for policy action that buttresses measures aimed at
improving enforcement and compliance with active labor market policies and unemployment
insurance. 45

                                Box 6: Shared Prosperity and Poverty in Turkey

Shared prosperity, measured as income growth among the bottom 40 percent of the distribution, increased during
2002-2008 as this group saw their incomes grow faster than those of the total population (7.8 percent versus 6.4
percent). As a consequence the share of total income in the hand of those at the bottom of the distribution increased
during this period (Table B1).

However, important challenges remain. Absolute poverty still affects a sizable share of the population and large
inequalities persist, starting from a very early age. Rural poverty is significantly higher (34.6 percent in 2008) and
has not changed since 2003. And, even though it has declined significantly over the decade (from 0.43 in the early
2000s to 0.39 in 2011), the Gini coefficient is still high.

Moreover, there are still significant numbers of working poor and vulnerability rates remain high. Younger and
older individuals, the less educated and women continue to be at higher risk of poverty than other groups (World
Bank, 2013).

These challenges call for well-designed economic and social policies that build on relevant and up-to-date poverty
and distributional data and analysis. The World Bank is currently supporting efforts by the Government of Turkey to
improve these data and strengthened analytical capacity. This work will lead to a better assessment of inequality and
social outcomes and ultimately to improved targeting and higher impact of policies going forward.


102. Policy actions supported by the CSDPL to boost domestic savings tackle the issue of
incentives and early withdrawal by replacing tax refunds with a direct government
matching mechanism. Under this mechanism, the government can match up to 25 percent of all
contributions (capped at the annual gross minimum wage). The matching mechanism also aims
to lengthen the maturity of deposits in the system by penalizing early withdrawals—i.e.
beneficiaries cannot access matching contributions during the first three years and have only
partial access before retirement.

103. The proposed changes to the existing private pension scheme may have positive
distributional impacts. Stronger incentives for households with lower incomes, combined with
the fact that private pensions accounts are delinked from wage employment, are likely to
translate into higher savings among vulnerable groups and informal workers. However, high
fund management and exit fees and somewhat restrictive eligibility rules to benefit from
company schemes could undermine the overall positive distributional impact of the reform.
Similarly, current regulations envisage vesting schedules that reward long job tenure and are
likely to be less advantageous to women.

ENVIRONMENTAL ASPECTS

104. The reforms supported by the proposed operation are not likely to cause significant
effects on the country’s environment or natural resources. Turkey has a fairly well
developed body of environmental legislation and institutions. In addition, Turkey is proceeding
with efforts to improve the environmental legislation in line with the EU Environmental Acquis
and significant actions have been taken since the Environment Chapter was opened in 2009.

105. The Bank is partnering with Turkey in its efforts to improve environmental
management through a range of Bank instruments (Specific Investment Loans (SILs),
AAA and DPLs). Turkey received the third loan in a series of programmatic energy DPLs in
2012. 46 With ESES DPL 3, Bank supported Turkey's actions in the field of climate change
mitigation and environmental sustainability with a focus on air quality, soil pollution and basin
management.

IMPLEMENTATION, MONITORING AND EVALUATION

106. This is a single tranche operation and all prior actions have been met. The
Undersecretariat of Treasury will be responsible for coordinating actions among other relevant
ministries and agencies. A number of other agencies are involved in the implementation of the
reform program being supported by the CSDPL program including Ministry of Customs and
Trade, CMB, BRSA, Ministry of Justice, and SSI.

107. The Bank’s ongoing TA program in private sector development will enable
continuous engagement on implementation and follow up activities. Specific areas of
engagement under the ongoing Investment Climate Assessment TA include: (i) regulatory
reform, (ii) competition policy; (iii) international trade; and (iv) innovation policies. An existing
Financial Sector Development TA lays the basis for the dialogue on implementing the
broadening and deepening of the financial sector.

108. The Bank has been working with the Government to support a strategic
management reform program. The Ministry of Development and the Undersecretariat of
Treasury have emphasized the importance of the results agenda, and are focusing on increasing
the M&E capacity in key line agencies. The Bank has engaged with the authorities through a

46
     Programmatic Electricity Development Policy Loan (PEDPL) was approved on June 11, 2009; Second
     Environmental Sustainability and Energy Sector Development DPL (ESES DPL 2) was approved on June 15,
     2010; and, Environmental Sustainability and Energy Sector Development Policy Loan (ESES DPL 3) was
     approved on March 27, 2012.


                                                    38
number of separate vehicles (Institutional Development Fund (IDF), Governance Partnership
Facility (GPF), Strengthening Accountability and the Fiduciary Environment (SAFE)). An IDF
grant completed in 2010 provided support to State Planning Organization and pilot agencies to
develop an M&E framework designed to assess the results of the National Development Plan.

109. Turkey is one of the seven countries under the Bank’s new regional TA that
supports institutional capacity for M&E strategy implementation. As part as this program,
up to five of the following sectors will be selected as pilot: Justice and Home Affairs; Public
Administration; Private Sector Development; Transport; Energy; Environment and Climate
Change; Agriculture and Rural Development; and Social Development.

110. The specific expected results indicators, set out in Annex 2, will be used to monitor
the implementation of the operation. The Bank, in collaboration with the Turkish Authorities,
will monitor and evaluate the program’s achievement of these results.

FIDUCIARY ASPECTS

111. PFM in Turkey has been strengthened considerably and is adequate for the
proposed operation. The Public Financial Management and Control (PFMC) Law of 2003
defines the principals, rules and structures for Turkish PFM systems including budget
formulation and execution, financial and internal control systems, and internal and external audit
structures.

112. The budget approved by the Parliament as well as the budget execution data is
made publicly available on the MOF web-site. The budget process is well developed,
regulated by law and orderly processes are followed in annual budget development. Each year,
budgets and indicative proposals for the following two years are prepared according to the
functional, economic and institutional classifications defined under the PFMC Law. The PFMC
Law has transferred the authority to incur expenditures and provide other approvals for
expenditures above predetermined thresholds (internal control over budget expenditures) to the
Strategy Development Units established within each public administration unit. The PFMC Law
also combines duties and responsibilities in a single spending authority that incurs expenditures
and is kept accountable. The PFMC Law has also introduced a modern internal control and audit
framework. Significant progress has been achieved in implementing modern internal control
frameworks.

113. Accounting. An automated online accounting system has been implemented. The MOF
developed in-house automated online public accounting system (KMYS) has been up and
running since 2002. The system captures receipts and payments from more than 1,500 sites of
the MOF’s General Directorate of Public Accounts (GDPA) across Turkey as they are made.
Periodic financial statements are prepared regularly and on time. GDPA prepares aggregated
financial reports for the central government, which are published in a monthly bulletin. An
accrual based accounting system consistent with Government Finance Statistics (GFS) is used by
all general government institutions, including local administrations. Public administrations have
been adopting commitment control mechanisms at the individual level however a fully
modernized commitment control system remains an area for improvement.




                                               39
114. Procurement. Turkey has moved decisively to upgrade its public procurement
legislation and practices in line with international standards. The current Public Procurement
Law (PPL), which was enacted in 2002, is based on the United Nations Commission on
International Standards (UNCITRAL) Model and moves Turkey in the direction of compliance
with EU standards. An independent Public Procurement Agency overseeing public procurement
and ensuring enforcement of procurement standards is fully operational. Turkey has achieved
greatest progress in the legislative, regulatory and institutional framework, and in the integrity of
the national public procurement system. Further improvements in public procurement are
important in: (i) eliminating restrictions in the form of thresholds for participation by
international bidders 47; (ii) reducing the frequency of use of exclusions and direct
procurements 48; and (iii) streamlining the dispute resolution system. Turkey is an observer in the
World Trade Organization’s Government Procurement Agreement Committee. New
procurement legislation for public utilities sector including SOEs operating in relevant sectors
would help minimize exceptions from the PPL49. Finally, the selection of consulting services
procedures would benefit from the use of quality-and-cost based selection system, particularly
for the assignments that require high competence and relevant experience.

115. Auditing. The TCA Law that was enacted in December 2010 requires regularity and
performance audits and significantly broadened the audit space of the TCA to include all
institutions using public funds irrespective of the public share in their capital. Until the
enactment of the new law the audits were transaction- based compliance audits even though they
did cover a large portion of government expenditures. The objectives of the new law were to:
(i) clarify institutional responsibilities, promote improvements in audit quality in line with
international standards and support the shift from ex-ante controls to ex-post monitoring in
harmony with the efforts to improve operational performance; and (ii) expand the scope of TCA
audits to cover the entire general government including local administrations, autonomous
agencies, social security institutions, remaining extra-budgetary funds and revolving funds, with
the overall objective of transforming the TCA into an effective external audit institution.

116. The objectives of the new law have not been fully realized since as a result of changes
introduced to the TCA law in July 2012 (through the Omnibus Law 6353), the TCA has
submitted only the traditional General Statement of Conformity (GSC) report to the Turkish
Grand National Assembly for the 2011 audit of government accounts. However, following a
recent ruling by the Constitutional Court, the TCA is expected to prepare institutional audit
report and external audit general evaluation report for the year ended December 31, 2012. The
TCA is currently undertaking internal reforms to align its institutional structure with
international standards for state audit institutions, upgrading its audit capabilities, and is working
on reaching consensus with other government bodies on the implementation of the new law.

117. Foreign Exchange Control Environment. The latest safeguards assessment of the
Central Bank was conducted by the IMF in June 2005. The safeguards assessment uncovered no

     The share of exclusions and direct procurement in the total public procurement amount has been reduced to 19
     percent in 2012 from 31 percent in 2011.

     While there has been a working draft of a new public utilities procurement legislation to improve operational
     efficiency consistent with the relevant EU directive, it has not moved forward since 2009.

material weaknesses in Central Bank’s safeguard framework. The audit reports by independent
auditors on the financial statements of Central Bank provided clean audit opinions for 2009-
2011. Past audits and generally positive assessment by the IMF indicate that there are no strong
reasons for asking additional safeguards such as audit of the deposit account.

DISBURSEMENT AND AUDITING

118. Disbursement and Implementation Arrangements. The proposed loan will follow the
Bank’s disbursement procedures for DPLs. The untied finances will be disbursed against
satisfactory implementation of the program and not tied to any specific purchases and no
procurement requirements will be needed. Upon approval of the loan and notification by the
Bank of Loan effectiveness, the Government will submit a withdrawal application. At the
request of the Undersecretariat of Treasury, the IBRD will deposit the proceeds of the loan in the
Undersecretariat of Treasury’s account at the Central Bank which will form part of the official
Foreign Exchange reserves of the country. The Government will utilize the proceeds of the loan
in foreign currency for either foreign debt servicing or for crediting the local currency equivalent
into the treasury single account for financing budgeted expenses. Prior to that, the Borrower will
pay a front-end fee amounting to 0.25 percent of the loan amount from its own resources. If,
after deposit in this Central Bank account, the proceeds of the loan are used for ineligible
purposes (for example, for financing items imported from non-member countries or goods or
services on the IBRD standard negative list), the IBRD will require the Borrower to refund the
amount directly to the IBRD, and the IBRD will cancel an equivalent undisbursed amount of the
loan.

119. Accounts, Auditing and Closing Date. The administration of this loan will be the
responsibility of the Undersecretariat of Treasury. The government will maintain accounts and
records, or ensure that such items are maintained, showing that loan disbursements were in
accordance with provision of the Loan Agreement. Given the IMF`s positive assessment of the
Central Bank, an audit of the deposit account for the proceeds of the loan is not considered
necessary; however, IBRD reserves the right to request the audit of the deposit account if
required. The Undersecretariat of Treasury will provide the Bank within 30 days a confirmation
letter stating that the DPL funds have been received and deposited in the Undersecretariat of
Treasury’s account assigned by the Borrower that forms part of the Borrower`s budget
management system. The closing date of the loan will be June 30, 2014.

RISKS AND RISK MITIGATION

120. There are three main risks to the program’s outcomes: (i) macroeconomic risks,
(ii) implementation risks, and (iii) political risks.

Macroeconomic risks

121. Following a very high growth period in 2010-11, exchange rate depreciation followed by
decisive monetary tightening in the second half of 2011 succeeded in rebalancing the economy
and helped Turkey achieve a soft landing in 2012. On the back of the first successful episode of a
controlled economic slowdown in Turkey’s recent economic history, Fitch upgraded Turkey to
investment grade in November 2012. Nevertheless, the high dependence on external financing



                                                41
(and low level of domestic savings) still remains the key weakness of the Turkish economy. If
there is a renewed deepening of the crisis in the Eurozone, including a global liquidity squeeze,
Turkey is likely to be hit hard with a possible sharp GDP contraction. Turkey’s foreign
exchange reserves and flexible exchange rate regime help mitigate risks associated with capital
reversals. A global economic upswing in 2013 presents an upside risk to Turkey’s outlook, but
should it be accompanied by rising global interest rates such an outlook could complicate
macroeconomic management for Turkey beyond next year. Hence there is urgency to use the
current global liquidity environment to accelerate structural reforms and consolidate the recent
economic rebalancing.

122. The proposed operation helps Turkey mitigate these risks by supporting reforms to
improve the business climate (Pillar I), which will help increase the competitiveness of the
private sector, thus promoting exports as well as higher inflows of FDI and promoting long-term
savings and deepening the financial sector (Pillar II).

Implementation risks

123. Implementation of the Commercial Code. To be most effective, implementation of
sections of Commercial Code's secondary legislation which expanded shareholder rights and
extended director liability will require an informed investment and legal community, as well as a
better trained judicial system tasked with applying and adjudicating these changes. Greater
efforts will need to be made to inform and train the commercial courts of the changes. A delay in
upgrading the judicial system, particularly commercial courts will pose a risk to the complete
effectiveness of the implementation of the Commercial Code. One key mitigating factor is the
phased implementation of the legislation. The pressure of competition within the auditing
community is a second mitigating factor in forcing the auditing community to re-train and re-tool
themselves. The Bank is in dialogue with the Authorities on the transition of SOEs and SMEs
into the Commercial Code. Discussions have also started with the POAASB on adapting audit
regulations to the Commercial Code.

124. Implementation of the new Private Pension Legislation. Given the past unsuccessful
attempt of a mandatory saving scheme, implementation of the state matching scheme, and in
particular the management of the state contribution accounts, is a challenging task, with a need to
build credibility for this new mechanism. Currently, the early withdrawal rates in the private
pension system are high—and average duration of contracts is short, at about three years. If the
exit rates decline and average duration increases, more participants will be eligible for the state
matching. This may also pose a fiscal risk due to the increased amount of the state contribution.
The mitigating factor is that in the long run, the improved domestic savings base will reduce the
external vulnerabilities of the economy and help promote sustainable high growth, which in turn
will increase tax revenues. In the medium term, increased competition in the sector, based on
investment returns and a commensurate rise in returns, leading to a faster growth of the system,
will lessen the need for strong fiscal incentives. The Bank is continuing to engage with the
authorities on the private pension reform to help ensure the effectiveness of the scheme.

125. Implementation of the CML. The main risk is that the capacity of the CMB may not
yet be sufficient to optimally utilize the enhanced powers it has been given. The Bank is
working with the CMB including to further enhance its capacity. In this context, the Bank has


                                                42
worked closely with CMB on the security settlement systems and central counter parties and the
development of mutual funds industry in Turkey. The Bank has prepared reports on both of
these areas in cooperation with the CMB, and is planning a workshop to discuss the findings of
these reports with participation of all stakeholders. Furthermore, the Bank reviewed and shared
its comments on the CML before it was enacted. Engagement with CMB is continuing on
providing comments to the critical secondary legislation under the ongoing TA.

126. Implementation of the Leasing Law: The main risk in the implementation of the
Leasing Law stems from the differences of the new law compared to international models (such
as the Model Law on Leasing adopted by the International Institute for the Unification of the
Private Law, UNIDROIT and IFC Leasing Guidelines), which may reduce the positive impact of
the introduction of the new leasing types leading potentially to suboptimal market outcomes.
Differences are found mostly in the definition of financial leasing, the tripartite relationship
between lessor, lessee and supplier and the right of the lessee to have direct recourse against the
supplier. On the other hand, the new leasing products introduced by the new law will both
expand the opportunities of SMEs access to finance and leasing companies to diversify revenues
and create additional volume which eventually help the leasing market grow. Mitigation
measures include continued dialogue with the Authorities to support implementation, including
in the context of a possible credit line in support of the domestic leasing industry.

Political risks

127. Turkey’s political situation is stable, but reform efforts could slow down in the
context of a heavy electoral schedule. Local elections are scheduled for 2014 followed by
presidential elections the same year. This election cycle may lead to a slowdown in the key
structural reforms and also some increase in fiscal spending in the run up to the elections. The
writing of a new constitution is also on the agenda.

                           ANNEX 3: POVERTY AND SOCIAL IMPACT 50

1.      The policies and reforms supported by the Competitiveness and Savings DPL (CSDPL)
program are expected to have positive distributional impacts in Turkey. Reforms included in the
CSDPL are organized around two pillars: (i) bolstering competitiveness via an improved
business environment and better governance; and (ii) boosting domestic savings and deepening
the financial sector. All policy actions supported by the operation are expected to contribute to
higher and sustainable growth, a stronger fiscal position and ultimately higher living standards
over the long term, while specific measures under both pillars are also likely to have direct and
positive distributional impacts over the short-term—i.e. measures aimed at reducing informality
and boosting domestic savings by restructuring the private pension scheme.

Distributional impacts of reforms to fight informality

2.     Informality, defined as the proportion of workers who are not registered with the SSI, has
been falling over time but remains high. According to Labor Force Survey (LFS) data, 42
percent of all jobs where informal in 2011, down from 53 percent in 2004. Most informal
workers are in agriculture, but informality is also high among urban workers employed in
manufacturing and services (World Bank, 2010 and 2012).

3.     Informal employment is widespread. More than half of workers aged 15-24 and over 50
are employed informally. Similarly over 60 percent of the less educated are informal, compared
to 50 percent of those with a middle school degree or 28 percent among those with complete
secondary education. And for almost all age and education groups, informality among female
workers is higher than among their male counterparts (World Bank, 2010 and 2012). Finally,
informal workers, particularly those among vulnerable groups, are at higher risk of poverty than
other workers because of lower earnings and lack of protection. Specifically, according to
ongoing work by the World Bank using data from the Statistics on Income and Living
Conditions (SILC), during the period 2006-2010 holding an informal (unregistered) job was
associated with a 10 percent increase in the probability of being poor while holding a registered
job was associated with a 40 percent decline in the same probability. 51

4.      One of the most important and costly consequence of informality is the economic and
social vulnerability of the informally employed and their families. Informal workers often lack
access to severance pay, social protection (e.g. unemployment insurance, pensions) and health
insurance and are therefore less able to cope with income and health shocks. For instance, only
50 percent of informal workers in Turkey would be able to sustain their living expenses for more
than a week upon losing their job, compared to 70 percent of formal workers (World Bank,
2010). And while some informal workers are covered by the public health system through the
Green Card program, many remained without coverage until 2012. Starting from 2012 all
citizens have access to the health services through the universal health insurance scheme. The
insurance premium for the poor (determined by the proxy means test) is being paid by the
Government. In addition, wages in the informal sector are significantly lower than those in the
formal sector, even when workers with similar characteristics are compared.

5.      High informality can also weaken incentives for female labor force participation. Among
less educated women, the combination of widespread informality and a low probability of
transitioning to a formal job may act as a deterrent to participation altogether, while low returns
to education (and, more generally, low wages) in the informal sector can do the same for more
educated women.

6.       A combination of causes lay at the root of informal employment in Turkey ranging from
strict labor regulation, to low institutional quality (including of service delivery), to low levels of
human capital, to weak monitoring and enforcement of existing regulations.

7.      Policy actions supported under the CSDPL directly tackle the issue of low monitoring
and enforcement by calling for an increase in the number of SSI inspectors and the adoption of
risk-based auditing. The operation also supports measures aimed at lowering the cost associated
with starting and registering a business which would lower the cost of formalization. However,
given that only a small fraction of businesses (less than 5 percent according to data from the
2008 BEEPS) fail to register in Turkey the impact of these measures on the incidence of
informality is expected to be much more limited.

8.      The hiring of an additional 267 SSI inspectors in 2012 will lead to a significant increase
in the number of audits and ultimately to higher rates of detection and subsequent registration of
currently informal workers. Over the period 2008-2012 efforts to combat informality by SSI
through audits and other means led to the identification of more than 1.15 million unregistered
workers and 80 thousand unregistered businesses. Action by SSI inspectors affected for
approximately 15 percent of all unregistered workers and 46 percent of all registered business
identified during this period. The hiring of an additional 267 SSI inspectors in 2012 represents a
24 percent increase in the manpower available for auditing. Assuming that the “productivity? of
the average additional inspector is in line with that of the inspectors working during 2008-2012,
this increase in manpower should translate into a proportional increase (i.e. 20-25 percent) in the
number of unregistered workers and businesses identified through the audits. A simple
calculation suggests that this increase would be equivalent to 2.3 percent of the total number of
unregistered workers and 8.2 percent of the total number of unregistered businesses identified by
the SSI every year (other things remaining equal).

9.      Young and older workers, unskilled workers and women are likely to account for a large
fraction of unregistered workers identified through audits. The SSI plans on collecting additional
information in the near future that would allow for a more detailed characterization of detected
unregistered workers according to their age, gender, level of education or sector of employment,
but these data is not currently available. However, given that informality rates are significantly
higher among young and older workers, the less educated and women irrespective of the sector
of employment, it is safe to assume that these groups would constitute the majority of
unregistered workers identified by inspectors.

10.    The adoption of risk-based auditing will also lead to higher rates of detection of currently
informal workers. Risk-based auditing targets occupations and/or sectors where unregistered
employment and/or underreporting of earnings are believed to be widespread. SSI has announced
plans to target auditing efforts to four specific occupational groups and/or sectors in 2013:



                                                  53
lawyers with a private practice, engineers with a private practice, individual and businesses
operating in the road transport sector and private schools.

11.     The prevalence and nature of informality varies significantly across target groups for
risk-based auditing. Data from the LFS suggests that approximately 25 percent of those working
as employees in the private practice or a lawyer or an engineer, 45 percent of those employed in
the road transport sector and 15 percent of those working in a private school are not registered
with the SSI. 52 And these rates are significantly higher among those employed in business with
10 or fewer workers, which are likely to constitute the focus of risk-based audits (Annex 3
Figure 1). Similarly underreporting of earnings is expected to be an issue for all four groups but
especially among lawyers and engineers and in private schools.

12.     Vulnerable groups account for a large fraction of unregistered workers in these sectors,
particularly in small firms, and hence will account for a significant portion of those detected
through risk-based audits. Young workers represent more than 70 percent of unregistered
employees working in the private practice of lawyers or engineers and in private schools while
they account for only 55 percent of wage employment. Similarly older workers account for over
10 percent of unregistered workers in the road transport sector and private schools but only 3
percent of all wage earners. In addition, more than 20 percent of unregistered workers in
professional private practices and almost all unregistered workers in the road transport sector
have primary education or less. Finally, women represent almost 40 percent and 50 percent of all

52
     The incidence of unregistered employment may in reality be somewhat lower than suggested by the LFS data
     since not all workers are required to register—i.e. some of those who are not registered should not be considered
     informal. In fact informality rates constructed using SSI data, which takes this distinction into account, are on
     average slightly lower than those based on survey data.


                                                          54
unregistered workers in private professional practices and private schools respectively but
account for only 23 percent of all wage earners. The relative weight of vulnerable groups among
the informally employed is higher in firms with less than 10 workers, although the differences
are small (Annex 3 Figure 2).

13.     Higher levels of detection of unregistered workers associated with an increase in the
number of Social Security inspectors and the introduction of risk-based auditing will have
positive distributional impacts. Upon identification employers are requested to register informal
workers with the SSI and, in the absence of employer action, the agency registers workers ex-
officio. A similar process is followed for those whose wages are underreported. Registration with
the SSI will bring these workers under the umbrella of social protection and allow for severance,
unemployment insurance and pension payments calculations to be made on the basis of their full
salary. And these benefits will disproportionately accrue to vulnerable workers (i.e. young and
older workers, less educated workers and women) who are “over-represented? among those
detected and registered.

14.     However positive distributional impacts could be somewhat smaller than suggested. Two
main factors account for this. First, data and projections from the SSI suggest that the number of
unregistered workers and unregistered businesses detected has declined over 2008-2010. This
fall can be mainly explained by the fact that once the “low hanging? fruit has been plucked the
returns to auditing will be smaller. Nevertheless, detection in nominal terms has increased in
2011 and more importantly, the introduction of risk-based auditing is likely to mitigate and
possibly reverse this trend by focusing efforts where detection rates can be highest. This
operation aims to support the government in increasing the detection rate defined as “the ratio of
the workers identified as unregistered to total number of workers in the workplaces audited?.

15.     Second it is possible for some unregistered workers to lose their employment upon being
detected. Formalization increases the cost of labor as workers and employers now have to pay
social security contributions and other taxes. If the increase in the cost of particular worker is
higher than her productivity, the employer is likely to fire her rather than registering her with the


                                                      55
SSI. Because vulnerable workers are often the least productive workers there may be a trade-off
between formalization and equity (World Bank, 2010), thus calling for policy action that
buttresses measures aimed at improving enforcement and compliance with active labor market
policies and unemployment insurance.

Distributional impacts of private pension scheme reform

16.     The private pension scheme has grown significantly since its creation a decade ago but its
assets are still low and in-built incentives for increased savings are skewed toward higher income
groups. Deposits in the private pension system amounted to 1.1 percent of GDP at the end of
2011 and further expansion seemed difficult due to a combination of challenges including high
administrative costs and high rates of early withdrawal. In addition, the use of tax incentives as
the main mechanism to attract funds to the system may have favored high income groups over
those with more limited savings capacity.

17.    Policy actions supported under the CSDPL directly tackle the issue of incentives and
early withdrawal by replacing tax refunds with a direct government matching mechanism. Under
this mechanism the government can match up to 25 percent of all contributions (capped at the
annual gross minimum wage). The matching mechanism also aims to lengthen the maturity of
deposits in the system by penalizing early withdrawals—i.e. beneficiaries cannot access
matching contributions during the first three years and have only partial access before retirement.

18.     The proposed changes to the existing private pension scheme may have positive
distributional impacts. Stronger incentives for households with lower incomes, combined with
the fact that private pensions accounts are delinked from wage employment, are likely to
translate into higher savings among vulnerable groups and informal workers. Because saving
rates are on average low (or even negative) among these groups (e.g. in 2003-05 and 2007-08,
saving rates among the first and second quintiles were -10 percent and 5 percent respectively,
compared to more than 25 percent for the top quintile), even modest a modest increase in their
savings capacity can have significant impacts on their ability to weather shocks and contribute to
raise their living standards. 53

19.     However, high (fund management and exit) fees and somewhat restrictive eligibility rules
to benefit from company schemes could undermine the overall positive distributional impact of
the reform. Stipulated fees remain high by international standards and can render the government
matching contribution meaningless, hence discouraging many investors—particularly small
investors for whom matching contributions may fall below the minimum wage cap on total
matching funds. Similarly current regulations envisage vesting schedules that reward long job
tenure are likely to be detrimental to women. Women typically have shorter employment spells
than men because of both lower participation rates and weaker labor market attachment. As a
result vesting rules that require a relative high minimum number of years of employment (7 in
the current legislation) in order to qualify for employer pension contributions imply that most of
these contributions will accrue to men.

20.     Going forward, the adoption of international best practices regarding fees, such as the
removal of provisions allowing performance fees or the substitution of exit fees with restrictive
withdrawal rules could help strengthen incentives for savings among those with lower incomes
and savings capacity. Similarly shortening vesting schedules or allowing for the phasing in of
employer contributions conditional on job tenure would allow many women to start saving using
private pension accounts.

     IMF Executive Board Concludes 2012 Article IV Consultation with
     Turkey
     Public Information Notice (PIN) No. 12/130
     November 20, 2012

     On November 16, 2012, the Executive Board of the International Monetary Fund (IMF)
     concluded the Article IV consultation with Turkey.

     Background
     After growing well above trend in 2010 and 2011, the Turkish economy has slowed to a
     more sustainable 3 percent growth rate this year. Growth has also become more balanced,
     as domestic demand and imports decelerated on the back of tighter monetary and macro-
     prudential policies implemented in 2011, while exports continue to perform well thanks to
     successful diversification towards new markets. In November, Turkey was upgraded to
     investment grade by one credit rating agency.
     Slower and more balanced growth is helping to unwind imbalances. The current account
     deficit has shrunk significantly, by 33 percent year-on-year in the year to August. Inflation,
     both headline and core, is also coming down from its peak in early 2012, though recent
     increases in indirect taxes and administered prices have boosted it temporarily and could
     further undermine competitiveness.
     The primary budget surplus so far in 2012 has fallen significantly relative to the same
     period last year. The budget target for the year is expected to be missed, notably because
     of spending overruns in the areas of personnel, health, and capital spending. The banking
     system remains well capitalized, with capital ratios at more than 16 percent and well above
     regulatory minima, and not materially impacted by the introduction of Basel II and II.5.
     Profitability is strong, and Non-Performing Loans (NPLs) remain near historic lows despite a
     minor uptick in recent months.
     Executive Board Assessment
     Executive Directors commended the Turkish authorities for setting the stage for more
     sustainable and balanced growth in 2012, accompanied by declines in the current account
     deficit and inflation. Directors noted that the outlook is clouded by external uncertainties,
     and that Turkey remains vulnerable to shifts in market sentiment, given the country’s still
     large external financing needs. Policy priorities thus need to remain geared toward a
     continued unwinding of imbalances. Raising domestic savings and enhancing the
     economy’s potential are important objectives over the medium term.
     Directors welcomed the tighter fiscal policy stance proposed in the 2013 budget, turning
     around the pro-cyclical stance of this year and contributing to a more balanced policy mix.
     They underlined the importance of containing growth in current spending, including the
     wage bill, while protecting priority infrastructure investment. Directors welcomed ongoing
     measures to broaden the tax base, enhance tax administration, and improve budget
     flexibility. Further efforts, particularly on spending reforms, would be needed to achieve
     the desirable level of the primary surplus. Directors viewed the medium-term fiscal
     program for 2013-15 as a welcome step in the right direction.
     Noting that inflation remains above the target band and inflation expectations stay
     elevated, Directors recommended that the Central Bank adopt a more forward-looking
     monetary policy stance and closely monitor developments in domestic demand, wages, and
     capital flows. They recognized the challenging environment in which the monetary policy
     framework operates, with its objectives of both price and financial stability. Many Directors
     saw merit in returning to a positive real policy rate under a conventional inflation-targeting

framework, supported by a strengthened communication policy. A number of Directors
considered that, in the current environment of volatile capital flows, the more flexible
policy framework has served the Turkish economy well. In order to manage risks from
excessive short-term capital inflows, many Directors saw scope for greater use of sterilized
intervention, given the relatively low level of international reserves, complemented with
macro-prudential measures.
Directors commended the authorities for progress in improving the health of the financial
system and the supervisory and regulatory framework, along the lines of the 2011 FSAP
Update. They noted that banks appear well-positioned for the introduction of Basel III,
ahead of schedule. Directors encouraged continued vigilance and a broadening of macro-
prudential tools to mitigate risks to banks’ balance sheets. They looked forward to swift
action to address deficiencies in the AML/CFT legal framework.
Directors observed that the savings rate had fallen significantly over the past decade.
While welcoming the recent reform of private pensions, they noted that fiscal policy also
has an important role to play. Most Directors were of the view that a significant increase in
the primary surplus could raise national savings, thus reducing the country’s vulnerabilities
to volatile capital flows and boom-bust cycles.
Directors emphasized the need to improve competitiveness and the business climate.
