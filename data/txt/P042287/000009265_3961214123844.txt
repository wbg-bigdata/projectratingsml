REPUBLIC OF TUNISIA
ECONOMIC COMPETITIVENESS ADJUSTMENT LOAN (ECAL)
Loan and ProgLram Summary
Borrower:                The Republic of Tunisia.
Amount:                  US$75 million equivalent comprising (a) a tranche equal to
US$37.5 million and (b) a tranche equal to FRF 193.9 million.
Terms:                   Fixed rate single currency loan for up to 15 years, three years of
grace and interest rate for fixed rate single currency loans with an
expected disbursement period of two years.
Interest Payment Dates   March 15 and September 15.
and Rate Fixing Dates:
Description:             The Economic Competitiveness Adjustment Loan (ECAL) would
support a reform program aimed at achieving a sustainable
increase in the rate of economic growth while improving the
international competitiveness of the economy. The ECAL is the
first among a series of operations to upgrade the private sector and
to prepare it for the establishment of free trade under the
implementation of the Free Trade Agreement (FTA) with the
European Union, signed in 1995. The specific policy measures
concern the following areas: (a) a sound macroeconomic and
fiscal framework, including measures to replace revenues lost from
the expected reduction in tariffs and tariff surcharges; (b) the
acceleration in the implementation of the FTA; (c) the acceleration
of the privatization program in competitive sectors; (d) the
improvement of the regulatory and administrative environment in
which enterprises work, including actions to reduce transport costs,
to facilitate the passage of goods through ports and customs and to
improve the legislative framework; (e) a greater flexibility in the
labor market while protecting dismissed workers and containing
labor costs.
Benefits and risks:      The principal benefits that would derive from the implementation
of the reform program supported by the Loan would be: (a) to
increase the efficiency of resource allocation in the economy and
the productivity of the private sector; (b) to facilitate the
integration of Tunisia with world markets; (c) to strengthen
Tunisia's balance of payments and to consolidate its access to
private capital markets. Two main risks are associated with the



- ii -
years show that the Government's commitment to the reforms has
remained firm even during prolonged droughts and political crisis
in the region. The second risk relates to the transitional social
costs (labor dismissals) caused by the necessary restructuring of
enterprises. Increased output growth and labor market flexibility
should ensure that in the long run the overall effort of trade
integration is positive, and these costs are minimum. In the short
term, this risk is also limited because of (a) the Government's
ability to build consensus among the parties interested in the
reforms, and (b) the existing social safety net and the additional
measures that will be put in place to protect the welfare of
dismissed workers.
Estimated Disbursement:  The proceeds of the proposed loan would be disbursed in two
tranches:   US$37.5  million  upon  loan  effectiveness, and
FRF 193.9 million after the completion of a number of specific
actions. Release of the second tranche is planned for June 1997.
Appraisal Report:          None.
Parallel Financing:        Parallel coordinated cofinancing of about US$150 million will be
provided by the European Union.

REPORT AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT OF THE
INTERNATIONAL BANK FOR RECONSTRUCTION AND DEVELOPMENT
TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS
ON A PROPOSED ECONOMIC COMPETMVENESS ADJUSTMENT LOAN
IN AN AMOUNT EQUAL TO US$37.5 MILLION
AND AN AMOUNT EQUAL TO FRF 193.9 MILLION
TO THE REPUBLIC OF TUNISIA
INTRODUCTION
1.    I submit the following report and recommendation on a proposed Economic
Competitiveness Adjustment Loan to the Republic of Tunisia in an amount equal to US$37.5
million and an amount equal to FRF 193.9 million. The loan would provide financial support
for the Government's program aimed at improving the international competitiveness of the
economy and at accelerating its integration in world markets. It would be a fixed rate single
currency loan for up to 15 years, including three years of grace, and cofinanced by the European
Union. The Bank's Country Assistance Strategy has been discussed by the Board on June 13,
1996.
PART I: 1986-1996 - A DECADE OF ADJUSTMENT AND REFORMS
A. BACKGROUND
2.    Tunisia is a medium sized country with 8.8 million inhabitants and few natural resources.
Agriculture production represents one sixth of GDP. The share of manufacturing, 19 % of GDP,
is lower than in comparator middle income countries but it has risen fast in recent years. To
a great extent the economy's performance has been export dependent, and manufacturing
increased from 20% of total export receipts in 1980 to 50% in 1995. Prudent macroeconomic
policies coupled with successful diversification efforts have led to consistent positive growth over
the last ten years. Emphasis on social sectors has also led to a literacy rate and general
standards of education above those of most countries in the region. Its health and mortality rates
indicate that the benefits of income growth have been spread widely and are confirmed by a low
incidence of poverty (7 % of the population).
3.    Since 1986, when a decline in oil export earnings and excessive levels of public sector
investments brought the country close to a balance of payments crisis, the Government of
Tunisia has consistently pursued a program of macroeconomic stabilization and adjustment. The
Bank supported this program through six adjustment loans, the most recent of which, the
Economic and Financial Reform Support Loan (EFRSL), helped the country to overcome the
aftermath of the Gulf war in 1991. In 1986, the IMF provided support with a Stand-by
Arrangement followed, in 1988, by an Extended Arrangement. All the Bank and IMF programs
were successfully concluded and are closed. The reforms have aimed at liberalizing the
economy, which had been highly controlled, removing major distortions arising from taxes and
subsidies, improving the allocation of resources and reducing the role of the public sector. The



-2-
objectives of the reforms were substantially achieved, and the adoption of a gradual pace in their
implementation minimized social disruptions and conflicts.

Strong Economic Results
4.       In spite of adverse developments, such as several years of drought, the Gulf war and the
recession in Europe in the early 1990s, real GDP increased from a 3 % annual rate during 1980-
86 to more than 4% during 1987-94. The result was a doubling of per capita income growth,
2.4 % per annum. This perfonmance was achieved within a framework of improved internal
balances, a strengthening of the balance of payments and a declining inflation rate. The
comprehensive program of structural reforms that accompanied the stabilization measures
succeeded in increasing the efficiency of the economy and the role of the private sector. Thus,
in spite of a marked reduction in public investment, the rapid output growth and improvements



-3-
in productivity brought the ICOR down from 12.4 in 1980-1986 to 6.6 in 1987-1994. During
the same period, private non financial enterprises increased their share in total value added from
45% to 60%. The share of private investments in total investment grew from 44% in 1986 to
almost 50% in 1992.
Fiscal and Monetary Restraints and Exchange Rate Devaluation
5.     Monetary and fiscal restraints contributed to the restoration of macroeconomic balances.
The growth of monetary aggregates was kept in line with nominal GDP growth. The elimination
of prior requirements for all credits in 1987, the liberalization of virtually all interest rates,
completed in 1994, and the development of a money market created the conditions for a shift
from direct to indirect methods of monetary management. The fiscal deficit (see Fig. 3)
declined from an average of 5.5%  during 1980-86 to 3.9%  during 1987-94. The brunt of the
adjustment was on public investment, while the Government protected social expenditures.
Moreover, by 1994, the deficit was completely financed with non bank-instruments. This
financing pattern resulted in a fast expansion in the share of commercial bank credit to the
private sector. Real interest rates remained positive in spite of a reduction of two percentage
points in 1994. Together with the reduction in the fiscal deficit, this contributed to an increase
in gross domestic savings from  19.5%  of GDP in 1986 to 21.9%  in 1994.
6.     Fiscal and monetary policies were supported by adjustments of the exchange rate. The
real effective exchange rate (see Fig. 2) depreciated by a total of 30% in 1986-1991, and, since
then, has remained roughly stable. Some of the elements that result from the Government's
policy to maintain a stable real effective exchange rate are the absence of a black market and
a strong growth in exports'.
7.     The cuirent account deficit moved from an average of 7.8%  of GDP during 1980-86 to
4.3% during 1987-91 slipping back to 5.8%  and 6.5%2 of GDP in 1992 and 1993 respectively.
This transitory deterioration reflected a recovery in investment, a worsening in the terms of trade
and sluggish export growth due to the stagnation of European demand. The improvement in the
late 1980s of the current account allowed an amelioration in external debt indicators. Total debt
over GDP decreased from 67% in 1986 to 58.7% in 1994 and the debt service (see Fig. 4)
declined from 28% to 18.5% of exports.
Notice that between 1990 and 1995 the real effective exchange rate appreciated by 9%, 78%, 29% and 11% in
Morocco, Poland, Hungary and Portugal respectively, countries that compete in the European market with Tunisia.
v      The figures exclude the contribution of the construction of a new gas pipeline to Italy (Gazoduc) and the development
of a new offshore gas field in Miskar as these projects were totally financed with foreign direct investment. The
current account deficits including the Gazoduc and Miskar projects were: 6.9% of GDP in 1992 and 8% in 1993.



-4 -
Export-Oriented Growth
8.    Between 1987 and 1994 the volume of manufactured exports increased on average by
more than 10% per year, and total exports by 7.2% (see Fig. 1). This performance financed
the acceleration in imports of capital and intermediate goods, essential for investments and
income growth, and an improvement in the current account balance. Exports of goods and
services increased from 30% of GDP in 1986 to 43% in 1994. The structure of exports showed
remarkable changes: the share in GDP of exports of primary products (agriculture, fuel and
phosphates), dropped from 17% in 1980 to 4% in 1994, while the share of manufactured
exports moved from 10% to 25% of GDP. During the same period, the share of textile and
clothing in manufacturing exports increased from 47 % to 55 %. Europe has continued to be the
main market, absorbing 75% of exports. The concentration of markets and products make
tunisian exports vulnerable to political shocks and price fluctuations. For example, during 1990-
92 developments in the European market contributed to more than 90% of the 50% fall in the
growth rate of exports.
B. IMPLEMENTATION OF REFORMS AND REMAINIG ISSUES
9.    Accompanying the macroeconomic stabilization program has been a program of reforms
aimed at introducing market determined incentives and at improving the outward orientation of
the economy. Domestic controls on prices have been drastically reduced. Producer prices have
been substantially freed and distribution margins apply only to about 20 % of domestic
absorption. Consumer subsidies have been reduced and targeted to the poor. The economy has
been exposed to external competition: quantitative restrictions, which in the mid 1980s protected
the entire local production, cover now only about 15% of domestic production. But tariff
protection is still relatively high: the applied unweighted average tariff rate is 30%, while
surcharges, the temporary duties that were imposed, starting in 1991, on the goods previously
protected by QRs, range from 10% to 30%. Tunisia joined the GATT in 1990 and was a
founding member of the World Trade Organization. It adopted current account convertibility
in January 1993 and established an interbank foreign exchange market in March 1994.
10.   A tax reform was introduced in the late 1980s, including a value added tax with a main
rate of 17% and additional rates of 6%, 10% and 29% (on luxury goods). Direct taxation has
been made simple and brought to moderate levels. The standard rate for the corporate tax and
the highest marginal rate for income tax are 35 %. There is no double taxation on dividends.
Investments in new share issues enjoy major tax incentives, as they are deductible from the
taxable income of investors, with a ceiling of 35 % of the taxable income. The Investment Code,
approved in December 1993 limits fiscal advantages to a few clearly defined objectives and cases
of market failure. However, it contains incentives that are very generous (e.g., a ten-year tax
holiday for wholly exporting enterprises) compared to international standards.



11.   The privatization program, launched in 1987, proceeded slowly. Because of lack of
public support, the authorities needed to build consensus and demonstrate that privatization could
entail important benefits without excessive social costs.  Most importantly, an adequate
institutional and regulatory framework did not exist and was gradually put in place during the
years 1989-1995. Privatization began with small-medium sized enterprises for which buyers
could be found at acceptable prices. Up to 1994, 50 transactions were undertaken, with
proceeds amounting to approximately TD 200 million, or about 1 % of the average GDP. The
private sector was also allowed to operate in areas that had traditionally been the domain of the
State. Recent progress includes the deregulation of domestic merchandise transport, of urban
transport (partially) and the elimination of restrictions on maritime shipping.
12.  In addition to the privatization program, the Government introduced a program to
restructure public enterprises (PEs), particularly those that were unprofitable. Budgetary
transfers to PEs were reduced from 7% of GDP in 1990 to 4.2%  in 1994. Most small and
medium PEs are now profitable, exposed to the benefits of competition and enjoy management
autonomy. However, because of the Government's pricing policies aimed at subsidizing cereals,
oil and few other commodities, some of the largest PEs, in particular l 'Office des Cereales (OC)
and l'Office National de l'Huile (ONH), have been facing, over the last three years, a structural
operating deficit. This deficit has been financed through borrowing from the banking system.
The accumulated arrears with the banking system now amount to TD 700 million. The
Government recognizes that this situation is not sustainable and is hampering the development
of a sound money market, as the loans extended by the banking system to the Offices are
refinanced regularly by the Central Bank. The authorities have decided that the Central Bank
will grant an advance of TD 700 million to the budget, to allow the Offices to repay any
outstanding arrear with the banks. This advance will be repaid by the budget over 12 years.
The Government will also ensure that any possible arrears that might arise in the future will be
covered by appropriate budgetary allocations. The fiscal consequences of this plan are
described in Paragraph 25.
13.   Regulatory reforms in the financial sector, which started in 1987 and evolved over
several years, have been deep. Liberalization measures included, among other reforms, the
elimination of (i) prior authorization by the Central Bank of Tunisia (BCT) for making banking
loans; (ii) most controls on interest rates; and (iii) commercial banks' obligation to finance the
budget. More recently, between 1991 and 1993, prudential regulations were also revised to
introduce stringent rules for loan classification and interest suspension and limits on risk
concentration to group borrowers and on exposure. The Central Bank's own capacities for
supervising and inspecting banks were reorganized and strengthened. In 1994, with the
amendment of the Banking Law the conditions and qualifications for the creation, ownership,
and management of banks were also redefined. These measures are enabling the financial market
to develop, though it remains dominated by public sector institutions that are less efficient than
the private banks.  In fact, all financial institutions have strengthened their portfolios,



- 6 -
provisioned a higher percentage of income and are now complying with existing prudential
regulations, with the exception of a couple of public banks.
Recent Developments
14.   Real GDP increased only by 2.6%  in 1995, because of a 10%  contraction in the
agricultural sector due to the continuation of the drought, and a reduction in fixed investments.
Inflation remained under control in spite of increases in the price of agricultural products. A
shortfall in revenues, due to a prolonged stagnation in economic activity, resulted in a budget
deficit higher than expected, 4.2% of GDP (see Table 1). Private sector investments continued
a two-year decline. Investment decisions may have been delayed by the uncertainty surrounding
the beginning of the FTA. The introduction in the 1996 Finance law of measures to accelerate
the implementation of the FTA through the elimination of import duties on equipment goods,
is expected to have positive effects on investment in the near future.
15.   The external balances show a mixed picture. After a remarkable improvement in 19943,
the current account deficit rose to 4.0% of GDP in 1995 because of a slowdown in the exports
of olive oil and a drought-induced increase in cereals imports. However, the growth of
manufactured exports remained strong, 5.5% in volume terms. External reserves reached
2.6 months of imports in 1995. The stock of external debt stood at 54.7% of GDP in 1995,
down from an average of 63.7% during the period 1987-93. The debt service ratio also
decreased steadily in the past five years, thanks to rapid export growth.
The Free Trade Agreement
16.   Tunisia was the first country in the North-Africa and Middle East Region to sign a
regional free trade agreement with the EU. The objective of the FTA, which complements
recent agreements under the GATT, is to fully integrate the economies of Tunisia and the EU
through free movements of goods, and legislative, social and financial cooperation. Under the
FTA, tariffs on imports (excluding agricultural goods) will be progressively eliminated over a
12-year period, starting with those on capital and intermediate goods and only subsequently (four
years after the entry into force of the FTA) on most consumer goods. Although the transition
to free trade is stretched out, the FTA is a major policy initiative for Tunisia. It provides a
clear signal to the private sector that in the future there will be no protection to shelter behind.
Its credibility is enhanced by the binding nature of the commitment, and by the implicit linkage
between the financial assistance that the EU will provide in the coming years and the
implementation of the reforms.
31    This was due to a slow import growth, a sharp increase in the exports of olive oil and a good tourism season.

17.   The benefits of the FTA and GATT agreements are potentially very large: import
competition will induce enterprises to increase their efficiency and allocate resources where
Tunisia has comparative advantages; an improved regulatory environment, harmonized with the
European one, will attract foreign investors; and the security of market access for Tunisian
exports will be reinforced. There remains an issue of losses as a result of trade diversion, which
is not, however, very important as trade with Europe accounts for about 75% of Tunisia's
foreign trade. While envisaging unilateral liberalization against the rest of the world in the longer
run, the Government believes that the benefits provided by the FTA are greater than those that
would come from total liberalization: the FTA offers a credible anchor to economic reforms;
it includes the harmonization of regulatory regimes pertaining to product standards, testing and
certification procedures, legal framework etc.; it allows agreements on anti-dumping actions; and
it involves significant financial and technical assistance.
The Challenge
18.   The signature of the GATT and of the FTA represents an unique opportunity for
sustained growth. But it also presents adjustment challenges, as existing enterprises will soon
have to face European competition. The Government estimates that one third of existing
enterprises will not be able to sustain this competition and will have to be liquidated while an
additional third may only survive if they are restructured. The fear of unemployment, which,
according to Government estimates falls on 16% of the labor force is the main reason why the
Tunisian Government negotiated a gradual pace in the implementation of the FTA. The political
consensus to a more rapid pace of change might come as the benefits of the FTA translate into
higher employment and standards of living. This outcome will depend greatly on the ability of
the Government to: address, over the next 5-6 years, the main constraints that inhibit private
sector efficiency; create a sound and internationally competitive business environment and
improve cost competitiveness; facilitate the reallocation of capital and labor towards sectors of
comparative advantages; and strengthen and upgrade the quality of exports.
19.   These reforms are crucial, as the competitiveness of the private sector is still limited.
First, as trade liberalization has only been partial, a dualistic structure of the economy has
resulted: on one hand, enterprises that sell in the domestic market, protected from external
competition, often inefficient; on the other, the exporting firms, under subcontracting agreements
in low skilled activities such as garment assembly. With the scheduled phasing out of the
Multifibre Agreement, these firms will increasingly need to compete with exporters from Eastern
Europe and Asia, that produce at lower wages and/or higher skill levels. Second, firms
encounter a number of inefficiencies and obstacles in the environment in which they operate that
hinder their competitivity: high transport costs, slow and inefficient port and custom procedures,
rigid labor market regulations and limited access to credit. Third, the public sector is still large
and operates at low levels of efficiency; and Government controls, although reduced, remain
important.

PART II: THE ECONOMIC COMPETITIVENESS ADJUSTMENT PROGRAM
20.  In the coming years Tunisia will need to: (a) improve the international competitiveness
of the economy; (b) modernize services provision; and (c) preserve the environment and improve
the management of natural resources. The Government recognizes that these are the key
conditions to increase economic growth and achieve full integration in the world economy. The
Bank's country assistance strategy, supporting the Government's agenda in all these areas, was
discussed at the Board on June 13, 1996.
21.   Consistent with the Bank's assistance strategy, the ECAL would address a broad policy
agenda to upgrade the competitiveness of the private sector and prepare it for increased
competition in the context of the FTA. The program supported by the ECAL would focus on
five components: First, it would foster the continuation of a stable macroeconomic framework;
Second, it would accelerate the implementation of the FTA and the reduction of tariff
surcharges; Third, by accelerating the pace of privatization, it would increase the role of the
private sector in the economy. Fourth, it would improve the regulatory and administrative
environment in which enterprises operate, through lower transport costs, trade facilitation and
an improved legislative framework. Fifth, it would increase flexibility in lay-off procedures
while protecting workers and containing the cost of labor. The macroeconomic framework has
been discussed with the IMF and the EU. The following sections as well as the Letter of
Development Policy and the policy matrix describe the Government's program. The measures
listed in Part III (i) have been fulfilled before Board submission, and (ii) constitute specific
conditions for second tranche release.
A. THE MACROECONOMIC FRAMEWORK
22.   Tunisia's macroeconomic objective is to move to a higher path of growth, while at the
same time preserving macroeconomic balances. This objective will require the continuation of
prudent fiscal and monetary policies and the implementation of a strong reform program. Under
these conditions Tunisia would be able to increase annual GDP growth from around 4 % to about
5%-6%.
23.   Growth prospects. GDP growth is projected to reach 7.1 % in 1996, as agricultural
production recovers, capital formation peaks up and international demand for Tunisian exports
remains strong. The implementation of the reform program is crucial to reach the projected
annual growth rates of around 5-6 % during the period 1998-2003. To achieve this objective, the
efficiency of investments would improve, as manifested in a reduction of the incremental capital
output ratio from 6.3 during 1987-93 to 5 during 1998-2003; gross domestic investment would
increase from 24.6% of GDP in 1995 to 27.0% by the end of the decade following the
implementation of the FTA and an improvement in incentives. Higher gross domestic savings



- 9 -
(from 21 % of GDP in 1995 to 26.0%  of GDP in 2003) would result from a reduction in the
fiscal deficit and an increase in private savings.

24.   Export growth. The projected increase in manufacturing exports, from an average of
20% of GDP in 1987-93 to 29.1 % of GDP in 1998-2003 is predicated on the effects of the FTA.
These effects will not be significant in the next two-three years, as Tunisia has already free
access to European markets. The increase in export growth would result, in the medium- term:
from gains in efficiency, due to a reallocation of resources from import-substituting activities
to tradables; from an improvement in productivity, as a result of structural reforms that reduce
transport, credit and labor costs; from higher levels of foreign private investments; and from an
increased market penetration, to be expected from the harnonization in norms and standards.



- 10 -
As to employment, the overall effect of the FTA and of the policy reforms supported by the
ECAL will be positive, as resources are redeployed toward labor intensive sectors where Tunisia
has a comparative advantage. However, in the short term the restructuring of industrial
enterprises and the privatization program may exacerbate labor mismatches and pressures.
25.   The rfscal program.  To maintain economic stability the authorities will continue
implementing a restrictive fiscal policy, to reduce the deficit from 4.2% of GDP in 1995 to
1.6% of GDP by the end of the decade. The implementation of the FTA will result in
cumulative losses in tariff revenues, of about 1.7% of 1995 GDP during 1996-2001. Starting in
1997, and over a 12-year period, the Government will also repay to the Central Bank about
TD 700 million in equal installments, on account of the obligations of the OC and ONH with
the banking system; and it will also ensure that each Finance law will contain appropriate
allocations to settle the unpaid banking commitments of OC and ONH during the preceding
years. The government's strategy is to maintain the overall tax burden and raise additional
revenues through greater reliance on indirect taxation and a decrease in the ratio of budgetary
expenses (net of debt service) to GDP, while preserving social expenditures. The 1996 Finance
Law already includes measures to compensate the revenue shortfall resulting from the reductions
in tariff and tariff surcharges: extension of the VAT to the retail sector, elimination of the
exemption of VAT on imports of equipment goods, an increase in the excise tax on tobacco, and
a move of the petroleum products from the 6% tax category to the normal VAT rate of 17%.
Over the next few years, the expected reduction in the fiscal deficit will be achieved through:
(a) actions to improve fiscal revenues, including the strengthening and modernization of tax
administration; (b) the enlargement of the tax base, in particular with a gradual elimination of
the fiscal advantages included in the Investment Code. The revision of the Code will take place
in 1998, after the preparation of a study and action plan to harmonize the incentives contained
in the Investment Code on the basis of the new commitments made under the WTO Agreement
and the FTA; (c) a decline in the ratio between expenditure (net of debt service) and GDP, to
be achieved through a reduction in the allocations made to the Compensation Fund (Caisse de
Compensation) and a streamline in other budgetary expenditures, including the wage bill. The
1997 Finance Law will include adequate fiscal measures to compensate for revenue losses due
to trade reforms and to repay any banking arrears contracted by OC and ONH in 1996. These
measures will include limiting budgetary allocations to the Compensation Fund to 1.7 % of GDP;
and reducing budgetary expenditures, net of debt service, in relation to GDP, without prejudice
to social sector expenditures. Finally, capital revenues are projected to increase sharply in 1996-
1998, as a result of an acceleration in the privatization program, and to remain at a considerable
level thereafter, as the disengagement of the State continues. These revenues will not finance
current or capital expenditures but will be targeted to restructure public enterprises.
26.   Balance of payments viability.  Maintaining a viable balance of payments while
pursuing the integration of the economy into world markets through the liberalization of trade
and exchange regulations, is a key objective of the Government program. The current account
deficit is expected to move gradually from 4% of GDP in 1995 to below 3 % of GDP by the



- 11 -
year 2004. In the next few years, the current account and its financing will be subject to various
sources of uncertainty. First, both import and export flows will increase substantially in the long
term, but the respective timing of these increases--and hence the short-run net effect on the
current account--is difficult to predict as the reforms involve radical structural shifts in
behavioral relations. Second, the Government expects an increase in foreign investment,
estimated to reach US$300 million a year by the end of the decade (about 1.5 % of GDP). This
represents a large increase from the past as two-thirds of foreign inflows in recent years
concerned Gazoduc and Miskar, two oil projects now completed, and is predicated on the
successful implementation of the FTA and the reform program supported by the ECAL. Third,
Tunisia's agricultural sector will continue to depend on changes in weather conditions4. Finally,
remittances and tourism receipts (representing together 30% of export earnings), will continue
to remain uncertain and volatile because of reduced migration opportunities and political
developments in neighboring countries5. To face the increase in uncertainty and vulnerability,
and to preserve the competitiveness of the economy, the Government intends to build up the
level of foreign exchange reserves (to more than three months of imports); and to monitor
closely the real exchange rate, now estimated to be broadly adequate.
27.   Financing plan. Table 2 presents the financing plan for the next four years. The total
financing need is expected to average US$1.7 billion a year. Multilateral loans (from the
African Development Bank, the European Investment Bank and the IBRD) will cover about 40 %
of the needed total financing. Tunisia's access to private international capital markets has
recently improved (the country received a Baa3 rating from Moodys in 1995) and private credits
are expected to play an increasingly significant role in financing the current account deficit.
During the next three to four years private creditors are in fact expected to cover one third of
total needs. However, market access is still limited. Thus, the Government is carefully
balancing its financing sources, between private markets and multilateral sources, to maximize
its debt profile. Thus, it is preferable that a considerable part of the financing come from
multilateral credit. Within this context, during the next two years the proposed ECAL would
contribute to the remaining financing needs with US$75 million equivalent. The EU would also
provide about US$150 million as parallel cofinancing of the ECAL.
28.   This financing plan is associated to an increase in reserves from the level of 2.5 months
of imports during 1987-95 to a level of 3.1 months of imports during 1996-1998. Such a level
of reserves is estimated to provide an adequate buffer against increased uncertainty from at least
four perspectives: (i) by historical standards, at 3.1 months of imports, the reserve to import
ratio would be 50% above its 1980-95 average (about 2 months of imports) and 20% above its
4/    In 1995, the third drought year, exports of agricultural products declined by 32%. During 1993-95 value added in
agriculture declined by 24%.
5/    For example, tourism decreased by 65% in real terms during the 1991 Gulf war (about 2% of GDP).



- 12 -
previous historical peak (2.8 months in 1988)6; (ii) net of imports related to off-shore textile
activities, the targeted reserve level would be equivalent to 4.0 months of imports, an adequate
level by international standards, even for relatively open economies; (iii) the targeted reserve
level would allow to absorb balance of payments shocks of a magnitude 50% larger than those
experienced on average over 1980-95 while maintaining reserves (after the shock) at a level close
to the average over 1980-95;7 and (iv) on the basis of scenarios illustrating possible shocks
affecting the current account8.

6/      Admittedly, reserves have been historically low in Tunisia, so that a 50 percent increase in reserves may not appear
very large. Should such an increase happen in the near future, it would occur at a time when Tunisia's standing on
international financial markets is better than in the past (as reflected by yield spreads of only about 70 basis points over
LIBOR), which, ceteris paribus reduces the need for reserves.
7/      Statistical analysis indicates that very strong negative shock would lower reserves from 3.1 months of to 1.6 months,
close to the historical average over 1980-95.
Two scenarios have been modeled to simulate possible shocks. The first explores the effects of a shock in tourism
revenues in 1997-98 equal (in percentage terms) to the one experienced during the gulf war. Such a shock would bring
the current account deficit from the baseline reported in Table 1 to 6.3%  and 8.2% of GDP in 1997 and 1998
respectively, and it would increase the firiancing need (comparing to the baseline scenario) by $400 million in 1997
and $920 million in 1998. The targeted reserve level would allow absorbing such a shock without additional
borrowing, while leaving reserves at 2.0 month of imports after the shock. The second scenario is based on the
hypothesis that import elasticity in 1997-98 would rise to about 2.4 (against 1.3 in the baseline scenario), possibly
reflecting a boom in imports of consumer goods. Such a shock would bring the current account deficit to 6.3 % in
1997 and 9% in 1998. The additional financing need would be US$400 million in 1997 and US$1.1 billion in 1998.
Reserves in this case would go down to 1.6 month of imports, which, as discussed, is close to the 1980-95 average.

Macroeconomic Monitoring
29.   Macroeconomic developments will be monitored during semi-annual consultations
between the Bank, the Government and--informally--the Fund, on the basis of a set of indicators.
As the program focuses on improving competitiveness in the context of balanced macro policies,
the indicators will include a number of variables relating to the balance of payments and to the
macroeconomic saving-investment balance (see Table 3).
Table 3. Monitoring Indicators

[Excluding the Gazoduc and Miskar projects.
External current account: developments in the external current account (in relation to
GDP) will be used as the main indicator of developments in the saving-investment balance of
the economy.
Export growth: the growth of manufactured exports will be used as an indicator of the
program's success in achieving one of its primary goals, that is increasing the competitiveness
and the outward orientation of the Tunisian industrial sector.
External reserves and gross external debt: raising the level of reserves, in relation to
imports, is an important objective of the program, on account of the increase in balance of
payment uncertainty in the next few years; thus, the external reserves to import ratio will be an
indicator of the program. However, the targeted increase in the reserve ratio should not be
financed by excessive new borrowing: gross external debt, will also be considered as an
indicator for the program.
Fiscal policy: a tight fiscal policy is central to preserving macroeconomic stability and
increasing the share of the private sector in the economy. The Government deficit to GDP ratio
will be used as an indicator of the ability of the public sector to contribute to the increase in



- 14 -
savings, and therefore to maintain consistency between the current account targets and the
expected behavior of private sector's saving-investment balance.
30.   Deviations from the projections of these indicators would trigger discussions with the
authorities to ideiitify underlying problems and explore corrective policy measures.
B. TRADE POLICY
31.   The FTA will come into force only after the approval -of the European parliament, the
parliament of all EU member countries, and the Tunisian Assembly. The Government intends
to ratify the FTA, of which a draft law is already before the Chamber of Deputies, before July
1997. The remaining QRs, with the exception of a negative list and of those on cars, for which
the GATT has allowed a three-year delay, will be eliminated before the entry into effect of the
FTA. Given the importance of reducing tariff barriers and accelerating the integration of
Tunisia into the world economy, the Government has already started implementing the trade
liberalization program. In fact, the 1996 Finance law includes reduction in tariffs (extended not
only to the EU but also to the rest of the world) on the import of equipment goods, as required
during the first year of application of the FTA; the 1997 Finance law will include the tariff
reductions scheduled up to the second year of application of the FTA. The Government has
prepared a plan for the complete elimination of the tariff surcharges in the next three years. A
decree establishing a reduction of 10 percentage points in all tariff surcharges was signed in
March 1996. This corresponds to a decrease of about 60% in the total revenue deriving, in
1995, from the collection of the surcharges. The remaining tariff surcharges are expected to be
eliminated in two equal installments in the Finance laws of 1997 and 1998. The Government will
also prepare, by July 1997, a plan to harmonize the structure of tariffs imposed on non European
imports; and will make publicly available to the private sector the precise content and tariff
reduction schedule of the FTA.
C. REDUCING THE ROLE OF THE STATE
32.   After independence, the development of industrial and commercial public enterprises
(PEs) has been the main instrument for the achievement of crucial government objectives, such
as employment generation and income distribution. By the mid 80s, PEs accounted for about
30% of total value added and formal employment, as well as 40% of total investment in the
economy. However, because of poor management and weak performance some of the largest
PEs became highly indebted. Recognizing the need to change, the government launched in 1987
a program of restructuring and privatization. By 1989, the legal framework for privatization was
set up. Law no. 1989-9 redefined public enterprises and streamlined the institutional
responsibilities for privatization by creating the Commission for the Restructuring of Public
Enterprises (CAREPP) chaired by the Prime Minister. The law provided most elements for the



- 15 -
divestiture process, especially granting decision making powers to the Prime Minister based on
proposals submitted by CAREPP.
33.    As described above (see para. 11), the results of the first privatization program  were
modest in size and slow in pace. Nevertheless, they created public consensus, as they showed
that most privatized enterprises became profitable and the net loss of jobs was negligible. The
slow pace was due to the fact that divestitures were undertaken only after extensive consultations
among buyers, unions and the Government. This process was long and inefficient, carrying the
risk of collusion among prospective buyers. Thus, in 1993 primary responsibility for choosing
firms to be privatized and for formulating privatization strategies was transferred to the Ministry
of Economic Development.9 Conditions were therefore created to allow the launching of a
second more active phase of privatization. By 1994, the Stock Exchange was privatized and its
operating and regulatory functions were separated'0. A new regulatory agency was enacted in
November 1995, with the purposes of updating the system of prudential regulations and
enforcing compliance.
34.    Although declining, the weight of the PEs in the economy is still large. It is also difficult
to measure, as the definition of PE has changed overtime. PEs, defined in Law 89-9 and Law
94-102 as enterprises where the Government, a local entity or an EPIC (public sector
commercial entity) individually or together own more than 50 % (or 34 % in the financial sector),
number about 232 of which 98 are public entities with no commercial interest and which can be
considered an extension of the public administration. The remaining 124 PEs, which include
15 financial institutions, are considered enterprises producing goods and services. Official
statistics indicate that in 1994 these enterprises accounted for 11 % of total wage and for 13.7%
of value added." To provide a comprehensive picture of the public sector and reassess the role
of the State, the Government has prepared a set of indicators (e.g. total and banking debt,
budgetary transfers and profits and losses) to gauge the importance of the PE sector
distinguishing between PEs in the competitive sector and those that are considered strategic.
9/     The recommendations of the Ministry, through a newly created Comite Technique de Privatisation, then go to
CAREPP which makes the final decisions.
IO/    Between 1990 and 1995 capitalization in the stock market increased from 5% to 20% of GDP (reaching 3.5 billion
Tunisian dinars in 1995) and new shares issued passed from 8 to 52 operations. However, the banking sector still
represents more than 50% of the value of new issues. Foreign participation is small. New regulations passed in July
1995 allow foreigners to buy 10% of companies in the stock exchange and 30% of other companies without Central
Bank prior approval.
The weight of the public sector in the economy is, of course, much more important. Statistical information on
enterprises with a State participation of more than 34 % indicate that in 1992 they represented 23 % of GDP (down from
28% in 1988). In addition, in 1992 the public administration accounted for 12% of GDP and 24% of employment
(down from 14% and 25% respectively in 1988). The public enterprise sector in developing economies is estimated
at 11% of GDP, while its share of GDP in industrial countries is estimated at around 7% (see World Bank
"Bureaucrats in Business: the Economics and Politics of Government Ownership", 1995).



- 16 -
35.   The Government is committed to privatizing all enterprises operating in competitive
sectors. It has presented to the Bank a list of 63 enterprises, representing about 60% of those
producing goods and services and totalling TD 1,413 billion in net asset value, that will be
privatized in the next two-three years. The realization of this program would disengage the state
completely from the cement sector, and partially from the housing, electrical and construction
material sectors. Based on the asset value of these enterprises, expected sales proceeds are
approximately five times the revenue achieved in the last ten years of the privatization program.
By the end of June 1996, the Government has put up for sale a number of enterprises equivalent
to 15% of the net assets of the agreed list of 63 enterprises (totalling TD 1.413 billion as net
assets); an additional 35 % will be brought to the point of sale -by July 1997. At that time, the
privatization program of the remaining enterprises, corresponding to a value of TD 750 million,
will also be presented to the Bank. Moreover, by July 1997, the Govermment will offer for sale
a minimum of 10 % in the capital of at least 5 large enterprises (mostly in transport and services)
where the State has a majority participation, through public offering at the stock exchange. This
follows the sale, in 1995, of 20% of the capital of the airline company, Tunisair.
D. REFORMING REGULATIONS IN TRADE RELATED AREAS
Shipping and Ports
36.   Despite recent improvements, the transit of merchandise through Tunisian ports and to
its ultimate destination is slow and costly. In Europe a truckload can be delivered anywhere in
the EEC within 24 hours'2 while in the ports of Tunisia merchandise stays on average 3-4 weeks
to complete all operations of unloading and custom clearance. Multi-modal transport is
unexploited and even lack legal recognition. The additional cost borne by Tunisian exports as
a result of inefficiencies in the transport and transit chain 13 has been estimated to be about 1.2 %
of the total value of Tunisian external trade, and 17 % of the total transport cost. Because of its
importance for competitiveness, the Government intends to intensify efforts to reduce transport
costs through deregulation of the maritime transport sector, removal of obstacles to competition,
and measures to facilitate trade. The objectives of the program supported by the ECAL are:
(a) to increase competition in maritime transport services; (b) to improve the efficiency of ports
operations, in particular the handling of goods and the pricing of services; (c) to reinforce the
regulatory and supervisory functions of the port authority; (d) to eliminate rigid and lengthy port

- 17 -
procedures and speed up customs clearing systems; and (e) to modify outdated labor regulations 14
suiting them to the needs of modem ports.
37.   Deregulation. The adoption by the EU of liberal shipping policies has decreased the
importance of the maritime conferences intensifying European competition with Tunisian
shipowners. In line with these developments, restrictions on liner shipping have been lifted in
Tunisia. Thus, besides the main public enterprise, the Compagnie Tunisienne de Navigation
(CTN), comprising a fleet of 10 freighters, eight private shipowners are now operating.
However, further deregulation of maritime transport is needed to introduce competition and
encourage the development of the private shipping business. To this end, the Government
intends to eliminate protective regulations such as those subjecting the right to charter ships to
the prior approval of national shipowners (stemming from Articles 6 and 7 of Law 77-13). In
addition, the Government intends to introduce full competition in port operations. This means
that private companies will be allowed to handle cargos in all ports. Thus, restrictions set forth
in Article 10 of Law 95-33, giving the monopoly of these operations in the ports of Tunis, la
Goulette and Rades to the Societe d'Acconage et de Manutention (STAM) will be eliminated.
And the private sector will be given access to all service operations, such as towage and
warehousing, most of which are now under the responsibility of the agency that administers the
Tunisian ports, the Office des Ports Nationaux Tunisiens (OPNT).
38.   Restructuring of public enterprises. In light of the measures to deregulate maritime
transport and increase competition, the Government intends to restructure and eventuaLly
privatize the main public enterprises operating in the sector. Two studies are being prepared.
Regarding CTN, the study will analyze the need, the timing and sequencing for changes in the
organizational and ownership structure. One option would be to unbundle the various activities
(transport of passengers, tramping, maritime agency, etc.) of the CTN and then privatize those
related to imports and exports of goods.  Possibilities for developing joint ventures or
partnerships, in particular with foreign investors, and the strategic orientations for each sector
of activity will also be explored. Concerning the STAM, the study will redefine its role as one
of the main stevedores, in competition with others, and will review its ownership and
organizational structure, including options for privatization. The study will also contain a
detailed inventory of the company's assets and its personnel needs.
39.   Increasing port productivity. To increase the productivity of port operations the
Government intends to proceed in several directions. First, port charges (by OPNT) are not
based on efficiency criteria and will be revised with the objective of improving port
competitiveness. Second, in application of Law 95-73 of July 1995, which grants concessions
(applicable to ports, roads and handling operations) for a maximum of 30 years, the Government
will publish the implementing regulations, including the pricing of port concessions to the
14i    The freight and insurance costs to fob costs over 1988-91 were close to 7% in Tunisia against a world average of
3.2% and an EU average of 1.5% (see World Bank "Maghreb Transport Study, op. cit.).



- 18 -
stevedores in each port of the country. Third, the legislation governing dock labor, dating back
to 1947, will be revised with the purpose of adapting labor regulations to the needs of modem
ports. This is urgent. In fact, there is evidence that the productivity of a Tunisian docker gang
is on average half that in Algeria; within Tunisia, the productivity of a gang in Sousse, where
there is competition, is more than three times that of a gang in Tunis. Fourth, the statute of the
OPNT will be revised. The objective would be to maintain and reinforce the regulatory and
supervisory functions of the agency (such as navigational security, control of the environment
and research) and incorporate the new regime of maritime domain while completing the
withdrawal from service provision and delivery, in particular warehousing and safe keeping.
These functions would be handed over to the cargo handlers- so as to complete their role of
stevedore-warehouse keepers.
40.  Inter-modal transport. A draft law  setting the institutional framework for the
development of intermodal transport will be submitted to the Chamber of Deputies before June
1997.
Trade Facilitation
41.   The trade facilitation program supported under the ECAL is a key complement to the
trade liberalization reform and the measures of deregulation in maritime transport. Following
international experience, and the results of a trade facilitation program initiated in 1993 with
World Bank help, the Government has created a "national facilitation committee", composed of
all concerned groups and headed by a private sector representative to spear-head the next phase
of initiatives. A decree describing the mandate of the Facilitation Committee has been recently
published. The work of the committee would be based on continuous consultation with all
interested parties and would address, over the next two years, the simplification of
documentation and ports procedures and the revision of the Customs Code. Standardized formats
for electronic data exchanges pertaining to external trade operations will be adopted. This would
decrease the high number and frequency of errors that arise from the use of non standard
documents to deliver commodities and would reduce costs. Customs practices will be simplified.
The Customs Code will be revised to bring it up to date and in conformity with the EU Code.
A commission, headed by the Ministry of Finance but with representatives of various ministries
and of the private sector and with the help of international consultants, has already been
formed. A revised Customs Code will be submitted to the Council of Ministries before July
1997.
Telecommunications
42.   Telecommunications.  Tunisia's future competitiveness will strongly hinge on the
quality, availability and price of telecommunication services, particularly to support
communication intensive activities such as tourism, banking and finance. The sector is governed
by a 1977 law which provides for the monopoly of the State in all areas of telecommunications,



- 19 -
except by specific ministerial authorization. Until recently, telephone services were supplied by
a Government department. In April 1995 a new law created a public entity, Tunisie T'lecoms,
to assume the operating responsibilities of the Ministry for telecommunications services. In the
near future the Government intends to establish Tunisie Tehecoms as a corporate entity with its
own accounts and a main carrier license that clearly sets out its rights and obligations as the
main operator. It also intends to build on existing initiatives and increase the availability and the
quality of services. During 1992-94 network growth has averaged 14% per year, reaching about
475,000 lines by end 1994. The average teledensity today stands at about 5.6 lines per 100
inhabitants, which is below modern standards in comparator countries but above the average in
Morocco and Algeria. The private sector has progressively been- allowed to operate certain
services using the public telephone network. The most recent example is the operation of private
telephone centers, which numbered 1100 at end 1995, totalling 4,600 lines. Measures are also
envisaged to review and extend the scope of value added services which can be competitively
provided by the private sector.
43.   In line with emerging trends in all of Tunisia's major trading partners and competitors,
the Government intends to conduct a broad review of its telecommunications policy and to
evaluate new options in order to accelerate the growth and provision of telecommunications
infrastructure and services. The review will take into account the lessons that can be learned
from international experience and practice, and that can be adapted to the Tunisian context. On
the basis of this review, a strategy on the development of the telecommunications sector in the
medium term will be prepared and presented to the World Bank by July 1997.
Improvinz the Legislative Environment
44.   The continuous updating of the legal, regulatory and institutional framework is essential
to improve competitiveness. Legislation in Tunisia is modem and, by and large, follows
European models, with some adaptation to the country's social requirements. Furthermore,
recent years have witnessed the enactment of legislation aimed at fostering the development of
the private sector, such as that on domestic and international arbitration, rehabilitation of
enterprises in economic difficulties, and leasing of real and personal property.
45.   Yet, there is still scope for improvement, both on the substantive aspect of the law and
on its implementation and enforcement. For example, new Company legislation needs to provide
for concepts such as single shareholder companies and holding companies, and for rules
governing corporate mergers, amalgamations and take-overs. The Commercial Law is in need
of up-dating, especially regarding payment rules, and modern forms of commercial contracts,
such as those dealing with factoring and franchising. The subject of conflicts of laws (Private
International Law) is now dealt with in numerous unrelated and out-dated statutes and is in need
of both consolidation and updating. There is a need to revise the system of law on real and
personal property; and to enforce creditor's rights by way of secured interests in respect of such
property.



- 20 -
46.  In the next two to three years the Govemment intends to (a) accomplish the revision of
a substantive body of legislation essential for improving the competitiveness of the economy; and
(b) ensure that this process of law reform will be carried out in a transparent way and with the
contribution of relevant individuals and groups, including the private sector.
47.   As far as the process of law reform is concerned, much of the work which might in other
countries be required of an autonomous Law Commission can be assured, in Tunisia, by the
Centre d'Etudes Juridiques et Judiciaires (the Centre): this is a semi-autonomous body under
the supervision of the Ministry of Justice, devoted--on a permanent basis--to significant, in
depth, law reform research and legislative drafting. Most importantly, the Centre can assure
that the modernization of laws is not handled exclusively within the Govemment but it is carried
out seeking the advice of those individuals who themselves are affected by the legislation. To
this aim, a decree providing for appropriate changes to the administrative and financial
organization and operations of the Centre with the purpose of ensuring private sector inputs will
be signed shortly. The Centre will be required to notify the public by press, radio and television
of each of its legislative reform activities and to solicit written comments within a reasonable
period from any citizens and residents. Also, the Centre will be empowered to establish
working groups to assist it in these reform activities. In addition, a ministerial decision (arrete)
of the Minister of Justice will also set out the details of the publicity requirements by press,
radio and television.
48.   As far as substantive legislative reform  matters are concerned, a detailed diagnostic
analysis of the existing legislative and regulatory framework is being undertaken by the Centre
with the objective of identifying the gaps and problem areas and of setting priorities in terms of
relevant new legislation. The analysis will allow the preparation of a "Legal Reform Strategic
Action Program". The reform agenda, to be completed before July 1997, includes: submission
to the Chamber of Deputies of draft legislation concerning a new Company Code and a Code
of Private Intemational Law. The Centre will also collaborate with the relevant Ministries to
enable the submission to the Council of Ministries of draft legislation conceming the Customs
Code (see para. 41). The Centre is being assisted by an Institutional Development Fund (IDF)
to strengthen its institutional capacity to undertake its expanded program.
E. INCREASING FLEXIBILITY IN THE LABOR MARKET
Labor Regulations
49.   Up to now, labor relations have been harmonious and lower income groups have shared
in the growth of the economy. Only a few countries have managed to achieve this consistently.
Tunisia's success is due not only to the fast growth of tourism and manufactured exports, both
of which created many jobs for the unskilled; but also to the govemment's labor and wage
policies; and to the structure through which the terms of employment are negotiated by the



- 21 -
representatives of the employees, the employers, and the Government"5, and through which
disputes are settled. Within this structure the Government has consistently tried to ensure that
its macroeconomic objectives regarding inflation and income distribution are respected.
However, as trade liberalization creates new pressures on fimns to be more competitive, some
of the regulations governing the labor market remain cumbersome and represent an obstacle to
the fast restructuring of enterprises and to labor mobility.
50.    During the next few years, the Government's objectives are: to improve the flexibility
of the labor market, and allow a speedy restructuring of private sector enterprises, as the
economy opens up; to protect the workers that are dismissed for economic reasons, while
ensuring that the separation packages are not so high to threaten the existence of firms in
difficulty and the jobs of the remaining workers; and to carry forward a comprehensive reform
of the social security system while containing social security charges and labor costs.
51.    The Government intends to modify some of the articles in the Labor Code concerning
firing for economic reasons, which result in lengthy and cumbersome procedures to obtain
authorizations for retrenchment. Currently firms in need to downsize their labor force have to
submit a request to the Inspection du Travail and subsequently to a tripartite body, the
Commission du controle des licenciements (CCL) which can sometimes take up to a year to come
to a decision. The Government is revising the labor legislation concerning layoffs for economic
reasons with the purpose of setting a limit of a maximum 33 days the time allowed to the
Inspection du Travail and the CCL to evaluate a retrenchment request"6.
Social Protection and Labor Costs
52.    Social protection of dismissed workers. Under the existing legislation workers that are
dismissed for economic reasons from insolvent or bankrupt enterprises receive no separation
packages, as firms are unable to pay. The program supports the creation of a system to
guarantee the payment of the severance packages to the workers laid off for economic reasons
from firms that are insolvent. This system will be managed by the Social Security Fund for the
private sector (CNSS). In all other instances the firms will continue to provide the severance
payments to the dismissed workers. On the basis of estimates of expected redundancies and
bankruptcies and on the assumption that the packages will be similar to those fixed in the Labor
Code or in the Conventions Collectives, this system would cost about 0.4% of the wage bill and
All rules governing the functioning of the labor market are negotiated by tripartite committees that include
representatives of the government, the employers' association UTICA and the labor union (UGTT). The terms of
employment are contained in the Labor Code and in 46 collective agreements, so called "Conventions Colleciives",
which are negotiated every three years. The Government has also recently revised the Labor Code to improve the rules
governing the settling of disputes.
161    However, some of the proposed revisions to the Labor Code may not increase the flexibility of the labor market.



- 22 -
would be financed through a reallocation of existing payroll charges for the non-agricultural
private sector.
53.   Payroll taxation.  The contribution rates to the social security system for the private
sector (24.75 % of the wage bill in May 1996, 17.5 % being the employer's share)17 are generally
lower than those prevailing in Europe, as well as lower than, or comparable to, those of
neighboring competitors. However, the declining population growth rate and the progressive
aging of the work force may force the Government to increase payroll taxes in the future to
maintain the same benefits. To avoid such an outcome, the Government is undertaking a broad
reform program of the social security system, in particular of the pension and the health
insurance system. The objectives of this reform are to ensure the long term financial viability
of the system while ensuring basic coverage for everybody. And while the contributions and
benefits of each component will be reconsidered, the Government intends to keep the social
charges at the 1997 level, in order not to increase the cost of labor over the next three years.
PART m: PROPOSED LOAN
A. LOAN AMOUNT, TRANCHING AND CONDITIONALITY
54.    The Loan would take the form of a standard adjustment Loan of two tranches, with
second tranche release conditional on meeting the key conditions listed in the Loan Agreement.
The Loan would be at fixed rate and single currency for up to 15 years, three years of grace and
interest rate for fixed rate single currency loans with an expected disbursement period of two
years. The amount would be equal to US$37.5 million and FRF 193.9 million.
55.   The following were the key actions for Board presentation:
(a)    Economic performance: satisfactory macroeconomic and fiscal framework.
(b)    Trade: (i) submission to the Chamber of Deputies of a draft law ratifying the FTA with
the EU; (ii) reduction by 10 percentage points in all tariff surcharges; (iii) agreement on
a plan to eliminate the remaining tariff surcharges in 1997 and 1998.
(c)    Disengagement of the State: (i) bring to the point of sale at least 51 % of the capital of
a number of enterprises corresponding to 15 % of an agreed list (totalling
TD 1.413 billion as net assets); (ii) prepare a set of indicators on the size and weight of
public enterprises.
17'   In May 1993, it was decided that the employee's share of the payroll taxes would increase by 0.5 % per year over the
period 1994-97. Thus, the payroll tax will reach 25.25% in July 1996 (17.5% being employer's share and 7.75%
employee's share) and 25.75% in July 1997 (17.5% being employer's share and 8.25% employee's share).



- 23 -
(d)   Deregulation and facilitation of exchanges: starting of (i) a study to restructure and
evaluate the STAM; (ii) a study to prepare a strategy for restructuring the CTN; (iii) a
study to revise port regulations; and (iv) establishment of the commission preparing the
revisions of the Customs Code.
(e)   Telecommunications:  presentation of the orientations of the Government for the
development of the telecommunications sector in the medium term.
(f)    Legislative reform: (i) submission for Presidential signature of the decree introducing
satisfactory changes to the structure of the "Centre d'Etudes Judiciaires et Juridiques";
(ii) presentation of terms of reference for the consultants to prepare a "Legal Reform
Strategic Action Program".
(g)   Labor: (i) agreement on revisions to the Labor Code's articles concerning the reduction
of the time-frame for lay-offs procedures; (ii) presentation of measures to create a limited

56.   Conditions for second tranche release are:
(a)   Economic performance: continued maintenance of a satisfactory macroeconomic and
fiscal framework on the basis of agreed macroeconomic indicators.
(b)   Trade: publication in the official Gazette of the law ratifying the FTA.
(c)   Fiscal: publication in the official Gazette of the 1997 Finance Law including satisfactory

(d)   Disengagement of the State: bring to the point of sale at least 51 % of the capital of a
number of enterprises corresponding to 50 % of the net assets of an agreed list (totalling
TD 1.413 billion as net assets).
(e)   Deregulation of maritime transport and trade facilitation:  (i) submission to the
Chamber of Deputies of a draft law amending Articles 6 and 7 of Law 1977-13 so as to
abrogate existing chartering privileges extended to Tunisian shipowners; (ii) publication
in the official Gazette of a decree mandating the use of, and setting forth the standard
format for a unified document (the "document unique") for customs declaration on
imports and exports.

regulations of dock labor to the requirements of modern ports; and (iii) implementation
of the plan to restructure the STAM and the CTN.



- 24 -
(g)   Legislative reform: submission to the Chamber of Deputies of a new Company Code.
B. COFINANCING
57.   The EU will provide coordinated parallel cofinancing to the ECAL equivalent to
US$150 million.
C. BENEFITS AND RISKS
58.   The next few years will be a period of transition during which macroeconomic balances
will have to be strengthened and the competitiveness of the economy increased, without incurring
high social costs. The successful implementation of the reform program will: (a) improve the
efficiency of resource allocation in the economy and the productivity of the private sector;
(b) facilitate the integration of Tunisia with world markets; (c) strengthen Tunisia's balance of
payments and consolidate its access to private capital markets. Two main risks are associated
with the proposed loan: first, there could be delays in the ratification of the FTA by some
European countries which, in turn, could entail a postponement of the trade liberalization
program.  Although the probability associated with this risk is certainly positive, the
Government's earlier implementation of the FTA, starting in January 1996, makes this risk
manageable. Moreover, the last ten years show that the Government's commitment to the
reforms has remained firm even during prolonged droughts and political crisis in the region.
The second risk relates to the transitional social costs (labor dismissals) caused by the necessary
restructuring of enterprises. Increased output growth and labor market flexibility should ensure
that in the long run the overall effort of trade integration is positive, and these costs are
minimum. In the short term, this risk is also limited because of (i) the Government's ability to
build consensus among the parties interested in the reforms, and (ii) the existing social safety
net and the additional measures that will be put in place to protect the welfare of dismissed
workers.
D. COLLABORATION WITH THE  IMF
59.   After successfully completing a Stand-by Arrangement with the IMF that ended in May
1988, Tunisia entered into an Extended Arrangement on July 1988. In July 1991, the EFF was
extended to a fourth year to support the program prepared by the Government in response to
effects on the economy of the Gulf crisis.
60.   Coordination between the Bank and the IMF has been excellent. The macroeconomic and
fiscal framework of the ECAL has been prepared jointly with the IMF and the EU. During the
preparation of the loan regular exchanges of views with IMF staff took place and the various
components of the proposed loan have been discussed at different stages.



- 25 -
E. DISBURSEMENT, FINANCIAL MANAGEMENT AND AUDITING
61.   The Borrower will be the Republic of Tunisia. The borrower will be required to open
and maintain five Deposit Accounts in US dollars, Deutsche Marks, French francs, Pound
Sterlings, and Yen each in its Central Bank. As each tranche is released, the Borrower will
submit a withdrawal application under the Bank's recently introduced simplified disbursements
procedures against which the Bank will disburse the loan proceeds for the borrower's use into
the Deposit Accounts. If, after deposit into the Deposit Accounts the proceeds of the loan or
any part thereto is used for ineligible expenditures, as defined in the loan agreement, the Bank
requires the borrower to either (a) return that amount to the Deposit Accounts for use for
eligible purposes, or (b) refund the amount directly to the Bank, in which case the Bank will
cancel an equivalent undisbursed amount of the loan. Although the Bank will not routinely
require an audit of the Deposit Accounts, it will reserve the right to do so. The loan will be
made on a two tranche basis. The first tranche of US$37.5 million will be eligible for
disbursement upon effectiveness. The French Franc second tranche equal to FRF 193.9 million
will be conditional upon satisfactory macroeconomic performance and a limited number of
specific measures, noted above. The projected date for second tranche release would be 12
months after loan effectiveness.
F. BANK ASSISTANCE
62.   As detailed in the CAS, the Bank is responding to the challenges of trade liberalization
with the following instruments. First, the recent preparation, in collaboration with the EU, of
a medium term competitiveness strategy. The measures of this strategy have been identified in
the Private Sector Assessment, in the most recent Country Economic Memorandum and in a
strategy note recently discussed with the government. Second, it would provide financial
assistance in two stages: the first, covering the next two-three years would address the broad
issue of competitiveness through three operations: a policy based loan, the ECAL, which will
be supported by a parallel grant from the EU; a project to cofinance the "mise a niveau"
program to restructure private sector enterprises, led by the EU (the "Industry Support
Institutions Upgrading Project"); and a vocational training loan, to deal with some of the related
social issues, such as retraining of the labor force (the Second Training and Employment
Project). The second stage, covering the following two-three years, would address specific
aspects to reinforce competitiveness. A deeper privatization program, the reform of the financial
sector and of the insurance system to promote long term savings and the development of capital
markets, the restructuring of the transport and the agricultural sectors, and the modernization
and liberalization of the telecom sector are the elements presently identified.
63.   Bank exposure. After achieving major progress during the past years, overall debt
indicators are expected to improve further in the future. The ratios between total DOD and
GDP and between the debt service and exports of goods and services have decreased from 69 %
and 22% respectively in 1989 to 54.7% and 18.2% in 1995; they are expected to reach 47.5%
and 17.2 % in the year 2000. Efforts to obtain support from financial markets have been
extremely successful; because of the country's good credit rating and good payment records, no



- 26 -
debt rescheduling has ever been needed. As a result of the reduction in the size of total debt,
the Bank's relative exposure has remained high. At the end of 1995 the percentage of Bank debt
service over exports was 3.7%, and the share of the Bank in the public debt service was 21.7%.
At the same time the Bank held about 19.7% of Tunisia public and publicly-guaranteed medium-
and long-term external debt. The share of preferred creditor debt service was around 40%.
However all these indicators are projected to decrease during the second half of the 1990s with
the exception of the preferred creditor debt service that will increase slightly before decreasing
after 1998.
64.   Poverty impact. The overall impact on poverty of the reform program supported by the
ECAL is expected to be positive as improvements in macroeconomic balances and in the
performance of the private sector would create new jobs and expand employment. Losses of
jobs may however occur in the short term. The recently approved Second Training and
Employment Project would facilitate the placement of unemployed people and increase the
productivity of existing workers. The ECAL would also support the creation of a guarantee
system providing severance packages to the workers of insolvent firms. The fiscal adjustments
that will occur under the loan will not affect social expenditure. The European Union is also
helping the authorities to improve the design and management of the existing social safety net.
Some of the financial aid that the EU will provide in parallel to the ECAL will be targeted to
programs aimed at assisting the poorest groups.
G. ENVIRONMENTAL ASSESSMENT
65.   The Loan is consistent with the Bank's environmental policies and will follow accepted
Bank procedures concerning the environment. The Loan has been given a C rating.
PART IV: RECOMMENDATION
66.   I am satisfied that the proposed Loan would comply with the Articles of Agreement of
the Bank, and I recommend that the Executive Directors approve it.

ANNEX VIII
Page 2 of 12
Dear Mr. President,
1.    The signing of the Free Trade Agreement (FTA) with the European Union (EU) in 1995,
represents a new stage in Tunisia's development. Although gradual establishment of a free trade
area and increased cooperation with Europe will result in growth of the economy and in
improvement of living standards, they also pose a major challenge. Much of the growth will
have to be generated by a private sector that, until recently, has been protected from domestic
and external competition. Now it must develop a solid and diversified export base.
2.    In order for the private sector to compete in international markets and increase the supply
of exports, the State must accomplish several tasks: ensuring a stable macroeconomic and fiscal
environment compatible with an increased flow of foreign direct investment; reducing its role
as a direct producer of goods and services; and providing a regulatory and institutional
framework that enhances competition and removes obstacles to the proper functioning of
markets.
3.    One of the main characteristics of Tunisia's development during the last few years has
been its ability to achieve the right balance between economic and social development. This will
be further strengthened during this transitional period, as one of the main goals of the
Government is to maintain social stability while promoting continued human resources
development, building on the solid base it has established over the last 20 years. In particular,
efforts to improve the education and training system to better prepare the labor force for the new
competitive environment will be intensified.
4.    To fulfill these objectives, the Government has prepared a program of structural and
economic reforms, outlined in Attachment I, and requests the financial assistance of the World
Bank, in the form of a quick disbursing operation. As described in this letter, the program would
build on the progress already achieved in nearly ten years of adjustment and reforms. It would
also complement the trade liberalization measures adopted under the FTA and GATT, and the
industrial restructuring program that has been launched in collaboration with the EU.
ACHIEVEMENTS TO DATE
5.    The last decade has been one of macroeconomic adjustment and reforms: stabilization
measures were introduced in the mid 1980s to counteract the effects on the balance of payments
of falling oil revenues, and reforms were implemented aimed at improving the outward
orientation of the economy and the allocation of resources. These adjustments and reforms have
led to remarkable results, notably the attainment of sustainable balances as well as the increase
in GDP per capita from 1.2% during the period 1981-86 to 2.4% during 1987-95. Inflation has
been contained. The budget deficit decreased from 5.4% in 1986 to an average of 3.4% during
1994-1995. Manufactured exports growth rose, on average, 8.4% a year during 1987-1995,



ANNEX VIII
Page 3 of 12
increasing from 14% to 24.8% of GDP; and the ratio of total external debt to GDP decreased
from 70% in 1987 to 54.7% in 1995. These were also positive signs of a decade of adjustment
and reform.
6.    GDP growth, averaging 3.9% during the period 1991-95, remained strong in spite of
adverse external developments, such as the Gulf War in 1991, a slowdown in European export
markets in 1992-93 and, beginning in 1993, two years of successive droughts. This performance
was made possible by the implementation of prudent macroeconomic policies and the
continuation of the reform program initiated in 1986 and further developed in 1991.
7.    In the area of external trade, important measures were introduced: the percentage of
domestic production covered by quantitative restrictions decreased from 72% in 1991 to 15%
in 1995. Tunisia joined GATT in 1990 and was a founding member of the World Trade
Organization. The convertibility of the dinar for current account transactions was introduced in
1993 and an interbank foreign exchange market was established a year later.
8.   In the area of domestic trade, producer prices have been substantially freed and
distribution margins cover less than 20 % of domestic absorption. A competition law was adopted
in April 1995, with the purpose of preventing monopolistic practices. The fiscal system was
modernized in the late 1980s through the introduction of a value-added tax (VAT) and a new
corporate and personal income tax code. The Unified Investment Code, approved in December
1993, has replaced several investment codes and limits incentives to a few horizontal objectives.
9.    During the period 1991-1995, the reform of public enterprises continued with particular
enphasis on establishing the necessary legal and institutional framework. The Stock Exchange
was privatized in 1994, and new legislation creating a supervisory agency for the stock market
was adopted in 1995. The private sector may now operate in areas, such as merchandise
transport, that had traditionally been the domain of public enterprises.
10.   Throughout its adjustment program, the Government has focussed particular attention on
the social sectors through the continued consolidation of its efforts in this area and has
strengthened its programs to protect the poor. Poverty affects less than 7% of the population;
the quality and the access of health care and education are much higher than in countries with
comparable income levels. In light of the declining birth rates and the progressive aging of the
population, Tunisia has initiated a broad reform of the social security system to make it
financially sustainable in the long run.
11.   Since 1987, the introduction of important financial sector reforms has led to the
development of a sound system of prudential regulation and supervision, as well as the
promotion of market forces. Measures taken have included the 1994 publication of a new
Banking Law which allows the creation of investment banks; the elimination of virtually all
controls on interest rates; the strengthening of the regulatory and supervisory powers of the



ANNEX VIII
Page 4 of 12
Central Bank; and the elimination of commercial banks' obligation to finance the treasury.
Monetary policy is gradually moving towards indirect controls.
MACROECONOMIC FRAMEWORK
12.   To achieve successful integration with Europe, the economy of Tunisia must move to a
higher path of growth, while at the same time preserving macroeconomic balances. The medium
term objectives of the Government are: to increase annual GDP growth from around 4% during
1989-1994 to about 6% during 1995-2004; to reduce the current account deficit from 4% of
GDP in 1995 to under 3% of GDP by the year 2004; to increase gross domestic savings from
21 % of GDP in 1995 to 26% of GDP in 2004, mainly through a reduction of the fiscal deficit
(from 4.2% of GDP in 1995 to 1.8% in 2001), and an acceleration of the privatization of public
enterprises. The feasibility of these objectives will depend on an increase in investments as well
as an imnprovement of their efficiency, measured by a reduction of the 5-year ICOR from around
6.3 during 1987-93 to 5 during 1998-2003. Much of the increase in efficiency will come from
the export sector, which will remain the driving force of growth.
13.   The financing plan for the next few years include a build up of the gross official reserves
from 2.5 months of imports during 1987-1995 to 3.1 during 1997-2004. The Government
intends to augment the level of reserves as a precaution to deal with the risks associated with
the shift to a liberalized trade regime represented by the implementation of the FTA and as a
means to prepare the full convertibility of the dinar. These risks arise from the uncertainty
associated with the behavior of importers and investors, as they operate in a free environment.
This uncertainty will add to the traditional sources of vulnerability of the balance of payments,
represented by the dependency of tourism receipts and workers' remittances on the political
environment in the region and of agricultural production on weather conditions. The Government
intends to preserve the competitiveness of the economy while keeping exchange rate policy under
close scrutiny. In particular this policy will take into account the pressures on the balance of
payments that may derive as trade liberalization progresses and the impact of increased capital
flows associated with a further liberalization of the capital account.
14.   Within the context of this adjustment operation, the Government will review, jointly with
the Bank, the macroeconomic performance every six months on the basis of a periodically
updated framework. The objectives are to maintain a sound savings-investment balance in the
economy, to ensure the sustainability of the fiscal balances, to increase the outward orientation
of the economy and to reduce the debt burden. Progress in achieving these goals will be assessed
using the following set of indicators: the ratio between current account deficit and GDP, the
ratio between fiscal deficit and GDP; the level of reserves in relation to months of imports, the
growth of manufactured exports; and the ratio of external debt to GDP. Reviews of these
indicators will be carried out in a report that the Ministry of Economic Development would
submit to the Bank in advance of the review dates.



ANNEX VIII
Page 5 of 12
The fiscal framework
15.   The Government has prepared a program to limit the fiscal deficit to 3.8% of GDP in
1996, to 3% in 1997, and to 2.5% in 1998. For the current year, the 1996 Finance Law already
includes measures to compensate for the loss in tariff revenues arising from implementation of
the FTA; these include, notably, an extension of the VAT to the retail trade sector; the transfer
of a number of goods, including petroleum products, from the reduced to standard rate; the
elimination of the exemption of VAT on imports of equipment goods; and an increase in the
excise tax on tobacco. In the future, the Government will face a loss in budget revenues,
estimated to be 1.7% of GDP by the year 2001 as a result of the-progressive elimination of
tariffs with Europe and of the tariff surcharges. Moreover, the existing budgetary practices for
funding the Office des Cereales (OC) and the Office National de l'Huile (ONH) are not
sustainable and are hampering the development of money markets and of a sound monetary
policy as they have resulted in significant arrears to the banking system by these two Offices.
In order to address this issue, the Government will implement the following plan: (a) the Central
Bank will grant the Treasury an advance of about TD 700 million to liquidate OC's and ONH's
existing debts with the banking system; (b) the Government will, through budgetary allocations,
repay the Central Bank's advance to cover OC's and ONH's existing debt, over the course of
the next twelve years in equal installments (beginning with fiscal year 1997); and (c) for the
future, each budget (beginning with the year 1997) will include an allocation to settle any unpaid
banking commitments by OC and ONH during the preceding year. These debts are defined as
those claims which can be classified in classes 2, 3 and 4 and any overdraft in excess of one
month sales revenues (in accordance with Central Bank circular No. 1991-24).
16.   Control of the fiscal deficit over the next few years will be achieved through: (a) actions
to improve fiscal revenues through budgetary strengthening and modernization of tax
administration; (b) the enlargement of the tax base, in particular with a gradual elimination of
the fiscal advantages included in the Investment Code. To this end, the Government intends to
carry out a detailed review and prepare an action plan to harmonize the incentives contained in
the Investment Code on the basis of the new commitments made under the WTO Agreement and
the FTA; (c) limiting expenditures made by the Compensation Fund (Caisse de Compensation)
and reducing other budgetary expenditures, net of debt service, in relation to GDP, without
being prejudicial to social sector expenditures. The 1997 Finance Law will include adequate
fiscal measures to compensate for revenue loss due to trade reforms and repay any unpaid
banking commitments contracted by OC and ONH in 1996. These measures will include
limiting budgetary allocations to the Compensation Fund to 1.7% of GDP; and reducing
budgetary expenditures, net of debt service, in relation to GDP, without prejudice to social
sector expenditures.
THE REFORM PROGRAM



ANNEX VIII
Page 6 of 12
17.   The Government is firmly committed to accelerate the reform program to meet the
challenge of increased international competition. In this context, this loan would support the
Government's efforts in the following areas: i) accelerated implementation of the FTA and the
reduction of tariff surcharges; ii) acceleration in the pace of privatization; iii) deregulation and
improvements in the regulatory and administrative environment of trade-related areas, shipping,
ports, telecommunications; iv) modernization of the legal framework in which the private sector
operates; and v) increased flexibility of the labor market, while protecting dismissed workers
and containing labor costs.
Trade liberalization
18.   The FTA will enter into force after it has been ratified by the European Parliament, the
Tunisian Chamber of Deputies and the Parliaments of all member countries of the EU. The
Government intends to ratify and publish this international treaty (a draft of which was already
submitted to the Chamber of Deputies on January 9, 1996) by June 1997. In order to facilitate
the full understanding of the FTA by the private sector, the Government will also publish and
circulate to the private sector the precise content and tariff reductions schedule of the FTA.
Before implementation of the Agreement, all remaining quantitative restrictions will be removed
(with the exception of those on cars for which GATT has allowed a three-year delay before final
removal). Tariffs on imports of industrial goods from the EU will be phased out over a period
of 12 years, and the Government considers 1996 as the first year of the Agreement's
implementation. The 1996 Finance Law already includes the elimination of import duties on
equipment goods from both the EU and the rest of the world. In addition, the Government
intends to accelerate the calendar for eliminating tariff surcharges over a three-year period. A
reduction of 10 percentage points on all tariff surcharges has already been adopted. This
corresponds to a decrease of about 60% in the total revenue deriving, in 1995, from the
collection of tariff surcharges. The remaining tariff surcharges will be eliminated in two
installments under the Finance Laws of 1997 and 1998 at the rate of 10 percentage points per
year. In practical terms, this measure will represent a loss of tariff revenues estimated at 27%
in 1997 and 13% in 1998 of the total revenue deriving, in 1995, from the collection of tariff
surcharges. Thus, the Government will include in the 1997 Finance Law the tariff reductions
scheduled up to the second year of application of the FTA and the scheduled reduction in tariff
surcharges. In addition, to minimize the risk of trade diversion, by June 1997, the Government
will prepare a plan to harmonize the tariff structure on imports from non EU-sources.

Disengagement of the State
19.   Following the adoption of a strong legal and institutional framework for privatization and
the modernization and restructuring of the stock exchange, the Government's strategy is to
accelerate the process of disengagement of the State from the economy in order to increase the
role of the private sector, improve the efficiency and competitiveness of the tradable sector and
deepen capital markets. This program includes the privatization of a large number of public
enterprises and the sale of State participations. In addition, to reassess the role of the public
sector, the Government is preparing indicators of the size and weight of public enterprises
distinguishing between those that are in the competitive sector and those that are in strategic
sectors. The indicators would include total and banking debt, budgetary transfers and profits or
losses.
20.   The Government is committed to privatize, in the medium  term, all commercial
enterprises involved in the production of goods and services. A first list of 63 enterprises, with
net assets totalling TD1,413 million as net assets, has been selected. Privatization will involve
the selling of at least 51% of the capital of each enterprise with the passage of control and
management to the private sector. A number of enterprises corresponding to 15% of the assets
of this list was put up for sale by the end of May 1996; an additional 5% will be put up for sale
before the end of September 1996; and a further 30% before June 1997. At that time, the
privatization program of the remaining enterprises, corresponding to a value of TD 700 million,
will also be presented to the World Bank. This will include privatization plans for the Societe
Tunisienne d'Acconage (STAM) and the Compagnie Tunisienne de Navigation (CTN), based on
the restructuring plans to be completed for those two agencies.
21.   Besides privatization, the objectives of increasing the participation of the private sector
in the economy and stimulating market capitalization will be pursued through the public offering
of shares from public enterprises. After the recent public offering of 20% of the capital of the
main airline company, Tunisair, the Government intends to offer for sale (through an Oifjre
publique de vente) a minimum of 10% of the capital of at least five additional large public
enterprises by June 1997.

Reforming regulations in trade related areas
Shipping, ports and customs
22.   The increased participation of the Tunisian economy in international markets requires a
higher competitiveness of exports, to meet the standards of efficiency of the rest of the world.
In this respect a reduction in the costs of transport, coupled with an increase in the fluidity of
the movements of goods are key elements to improve the competitiveness of exports. In the
context of the IX" Plan, the Government is preparing a transport sector strategy that will aim
at: enhancing competition through completion of the deregulation of maritime transport and
cargo handling operations and a restructuring of the public enterprises operating in the sector;
increasing efficiency of port operations, through private sector participation in commercial
services, while reinforcing regulatory and supervisory functions of the port authority; improving
the pricing system, granting concessions to the stevedores in all ports and revising the outdated
labor legislation; and promoting intermodal transport.
23.   Deregulation.  It is the Government's intention to deregulate maritime transport of
goods completely and to allow full competition among private operators. The monopoly of the
CTN in liner shipping has recently been eliminated, several shipowners have been authorized
and are now competing in the transport business with Europe and other countries. However,
vis a vis their foreign competitors, Tunisian shipowners are still allowed the prior approval of
the right to charter. Such privileges, contained in Articles 6 and 7 of Law 1977-13, will be
eliminated by June 1997. By the same date, the Government also intends to introduce full
competition in handling cargos in the ports of Tunis, La Goulette and Rades, as it has already
introduced in the other ports of the country. Thus, the restrictions set forth in Article 10 of
Law 95-33 will be eliminated. While transport of goods is liberalized, passenger transport will,
however, continue to be provided by the public sector.
24.   Restructuring of public enterprises.  In light of the new measures deregulating
maritime transport and cargo handling operations, the Government intends to complete a detailed
review of the structure and the strategy of the two public enterprises, CTN and STAM, with the
objective of increasing their efficiency and productivity. Two studies are being launched with
the purpose of preparing restructuring plans. Concerning CTN, the study will indicate options
for restructuring the company, including: (a) the need, sequencing and timing for changes in
the ownership and organizational structure; (b) possibilities of developing joint-ventures or
partnerships with Tunisian or foreign investors; (c) strategic orientations for the development
of each sector of activity including transport of goods, transport of passengers, maritime agency
and other participation. The study will be completed by early 1997 and, after discussion with
the Bank, the restructuring plans will start being implemented in June 1997.
25.   Concerning the STAM, the main objectives of the study are to redefine its new role as
one of the operating stevedores in full competition with private stevedore companies, and to



ANNEX VIII
Page 9 of 12
review its ownership and organizational structure including options and approaches for its
privatization in the context of the new competitive environment. The study, which will also
contain a detailed inventory of the assets and personnel needs of the STAM, will be completed
by early 1997 and the restructuring plan will be implemented by June 1997.
26.   Port Management and operations. A competitive environment in shipping and ports
calls for a strong port authority, assuming the role of manager of public land and protector of
the port environment, in addition to having well defined regulatory functions. With this aim in
mind, the Government intends to review the 1896 Loi sur le Reglement General des Ports, the
1965 Loi Organique creating the Office des Ports Nationaux de Tunisie (OPNT), amended in
1967, and will submit new port legislation to the Chamber of Deputies by June 1997. The
implementing regulations will be prepared at the same time. To increase the productivity of
ports operations the Government intends to: (a) complete the pulling out of OPNT from services
provisions and delivery, in particular the warehousing and safe keeping cargo functions;
(b) publish in the Official Gazette the law modifying the decree of February 17, 1949, regulating
dock labor, with the objective of adapting labor regulations to the exigencies of modem ports;
(c) publish a new list of maximum tariffs for the operations of cargo handling; and (d) in
application of Law 95-73, which introduces the possibility of granting concessions, publish the
regulations and pricing of port concessions to the stevedores in each port of the country.
27.  Inter-modal transport. To improve the efficiency of transport and face European
competition, the Government intends to submit to the Chamber of Deputies a draft law setting
out the institutional framework for the development of inter-modal transport by June 1997.
28.   Trade facilitation. Efforts to promote trade facilitation started in 1993 and are now
intensifying, as a complement to the measures to deregulate shipping and ports operations and
to increase the productivity of transport. With this aim, and following the examples of other
countries, a Facilitation Committee has been set up and will be directing all facilitation
initiatives, including the introduction of a standardized document for customs declaration on
imports and exports according to UN/EEC norms. In addition, to harmonize Tunisian customs
regulations with those of the EU, a revised Customs Code will be presented to the Council of
Ministers by June 1997.
Telecommunications
29.   The Government recognizes that the quality, availability and price of telecommunications
services will be an essential ingredient for Tunisia to remain competitive in regional and world
markets. This will be particularly true for the efficiency of financial services, tourism, and
manufacturing, as well as opportunities for new service exports, such as data entry, publishing
and other services, which would be enabled by high-quality telecommunications infrastructure
with competitively-priced services.



ANNEX VIII
Page 10 of 12
30.   The Government intends to build on its existing initiatives and continue to introduce
measures to encourage the market-based provision of telecommunications services. A first step
will be to consolidate the establishment of Tunisie Telecoms as a legal entity with a separate
accounting system to that of its supervisory ministry whose rights and obligations as the main
operator have been clearly set out. Further immediate measures are also envisaged to review and
extend the scope of value added services which can be competitively provided by the private
sector.
31.   A broader assessment of the sector will take place in the context of preparing the
IX" Plan. The Government will conduct an extensive review of telecommunications policy and
regulation in the context of the needs of a more competitive economy and the opportunities
offored by recent advances in information technology. This review will analyze the adequacy
of existing telecommunications infrastructure and services as well as the policy and institutional
framework in which these are provided. The review will also consider what lessons and
practices from  international experience might be adapted to the Tunisian context.  A
development strategy for the telecommunications sector in the medium term will be presented
to the World Bank by June 1997.
Improving the legislative environment
32.   The Government is committed to revise a substantive body of legislation essential for
improving the competitiveness of the economy. For example, the Company law needs to be
revised to recognize holding companies and corporate groups and to include the concept of
unipersonal company. Gaps also exist in contract law, where new forms of contracts such as
factoring and franchising are not explicitly regulated. A detailed diagnostic analysis of the
existing legislative framework affecting enterprises will be launched, with the objective of
preparing a "Legal Reform Strategic Program" to identify gaps and and to set priorities in terms
of relevant new legislation. This diagnostic is to be carried out by the Centre d'Etudes Juridiques
et Judiciaires, in collaboration with representatives from the administration, legal practitioners
and representatives of professional organizations from the private sector.
33.   By June 1997, the Government will submit to the Chamber of Deputies draft legislation
concerning the Code of Private International Law; and a draft law for a new Company Code;
and will submit to the Bank a plan of action concerning a "Legal Reform Strategic Program".

Labor market
34.   Increasing the flexibility of the labor market, protecting dismissed workers and containing
labor costs are necessary conditions for restructuring the economy while minimizing social
conflicts. To this end, the Government's program includes a revision of the articles of the Labor
Code concerning the procedures for laying off workers for economic or technological reasons;
the creation of a limited severance scheme to cover separation packages for workers dismissed
for economic or technological reasons from insolvent firms; and a commitment to maintain, in
the medium-term, the existing contribution rates for the private sector at their current level in
order to avoid raising labor costs.
35.   The revision of the Labor Code currently under way mainly includes measures aimed at
reducing procedural delays for lay-offs for economic reasons. In this regard, the time allowed
to the Inspection du Travail and the Commission du Controle des Licenciements (CCL) to analyze
and make a decision on retrenchment for economic reasons will be fixed at a maximum of
33 days.
36.   A second important reform aimed at protecting workers is the creation of a guarantee
system to finance the severance packages of workers dismissed for economic reasons from
insolvent firms. This guarantee system will be managed by the Social Security Fund for the
private sector (CNSS) and financed through a reallocation of revenues from existing
contributions. Legislation setting up this fund will be presented to the Chamber of Deputies
before June 1997. It will provide a limited severance package and some insurance to the
workers, by guaranteeing payment of the severance pay only when the firm is insolvent. In all
other cases, the standard severance payments will be paid by the firms to dismissed workers.
37.   The Government intends to undertake a vast reform of the social security system. Initial
steps to improve the financial performance of the social security funds and to increase the link
between social security contributions and benefits have already been taken. A task force is
preparing a more fundamental reform of the system, that would include pensions and health
insurance. Within this broad context, the Government is committed not to increase social
security contribution rates in the non agricultural private sector during the next three years, in
order to contain the cost of labor.
Financial sector
38.   Following the adoption of prudential and supervisory regulations during 1991-93, most
banks have undergone restructuring plans and are now in compliance with existing regulations.
However, key institutional reforms are still needed to increase the competitiveness and the
efficiency of the banking system and to develop a financial sector able to sustain the necessary
increase in the rate of domestic savings and private investment. The objectives of the financial
sector strategy that the Government is preparing in the context of the IX' Plan are:



ANNEX VIII
Page 12 of 12
(a) improving competition by any appropriate means, including privatization, and the
strengthening of the independence and the quality of the management of banks; (b) reinforcing
prudential regulations, in particular with regard to the issues of debt restructuring, risk
management, evaluation of collateral; (c) improving the functioning of the money market and
developing secondary markets; (d) promoting a market for long term savings (reform of the
insurance industry...).
CONCLUSIONS
39.   The Government believes that the reform program outlined in this letter would enhance
the competitiveness of the Tunisian economy; it would reinforce the credibility of its
commitment to the trade liberalization program and strengthen the confidence of international
markets in the future of Tunisia. The adoption of this program would be greatly facilitated if
the request for a quick-disbursing operation of US$75 million were accepted by the World Bank.
