PREFACE
This is the Project Completion Report (PCR) on the Third Nimn
Gerais Water Supply and Swerage Project, for which-Loan 1850-BR (US$139
million) was approved on May 22, 1980. With its objectives substantially
achieved, the Project was completed in 1987, a little over two years late.
The Loan was closed on December 319, 1987, two and one hlf years behind
schedule. It wss fully disbursed; and the last disbursement was on
February 3, 1988.
The PCR was prepared by the Infrastructure and Energy Operations
Division, Latin America nd the Caribbean Region I  As tho borrower, Caixa
Econ&uics Federal (CEF), did not prepare a final project report, this
report does not contain a Part II. The executing agency, Companhia de
Saneamento de Minas Gerais (COPASA), responded promptly to specific
requests for information. Annex 1 sets forth COPASA's comments on Part 1
of the PCR.
Preparation of the PCR was started In March/April 1989, following
the return of a mission to gather information (January 1989). In addition
to the information gathered during this mission, the PCR Is based on, Later
alla, the Staff Appraisal Report; the Loan and Guarantee Agreements;
supervision reportsa correspondence between the Bank and Borrower; and
internal Bank memoranda.

EVON   R21AY
The Third Ninas Gerais Water Supply and Sewerage Project consisted
of a large group of sub-projects, including the construction and/or
expansion of water systems and severages to benefit the populations of Belo
lorizonte and of many medium-size cities and small cvuuunities of the state
of Minas Gerais, which includes a substantial proportion of low-income
consumers. To address expected market changes in the area served by
COPASA, this operation was conceived along sectoral lines with the result
that the Loan Agreement, instead of defining the Project in precise
physical terms, defined the Project in terms of groups of eligible sub-
projects complying with agreed selection criteria. The Loan aimed at
helping to finance a 'tine slice (1980-1984) of the investment program of
the executing agency, the state water company (SWC), Companhia de
Sanesmento de Minas Gerais (COPASA).
Even though completion of the Project was delayed a little over
two years for various reasons (macroeconomic. m8rket and technical, the
shifting sanitation priorities of the state, etc.), the Project was
instrumental in helping COPASA achieve its primary objectives of system
expansion (paras. 7, 15); and during the period 1980-1986, COPASA surpassed
its target levels for expanding the water-supply systems and sewerages. A
change in disbursement arrangements helped to increase the flow of foreign
exchange to Brazil -- a secondary objective (paras. 7 and 12).
To address a variety of factors encountered during project
execution, of which the most important was the shifting sanitation
priorities of the state, COPASA agreed with the Bank to changet (i) the mix
and timing of sub-projects constituting the Project; and (ii) disbursement
arrangements (paras. 12 and 13). These changes concentrated Bank financing
in fewer sub-projects, leaving the financing of the remaining sub-projects
expected to be part of the Project to local financing; and resulted in
reduced expenditure on the Projects US$314.3 million (actual) vs. US$391.1
million (forecast). Actual and forecasts costs on some of the sub-
projects, such as the Serra Azul water source, are fully comparable.
However, comparisons of actual and forecast costs for the Project as a
whole are of limited usefulness (para. 14), as they do not represents costs
on fully comparable projects.
During the period 1983-1986, the financial performance of COPASA
improved as measured bys (i) the lessening gap between gross internal cash
generation and debt service; and (ii) the improving trend of certain
financial ratios; but, due to factors outside its control, COPASA did not
comply with the revenue covenant of the Loan Agreement (paras. 19-21). As
Brazil was struggling with serious macroeconomic problems and as COPASA was
making every effort to improve its financial performance, the Bank did not
resort to normal remedies for non-compliance.



iii
Sector tariffs and finances, investment programs, procurement problems,
and auditing norms tended to be the major focus of Bank supervision missions.
Field supervision of the Project, which was light, was at an appropriate level.
From the point of view of the Back, there was excellent cooperation with the
Borrower -- Caixa Economica Federal (CEF) -  and COPASA.  Their respective
performances were satisfactory (para. 22).
The achievements of this Project underline the importance of the sectoral
lines on which this operation was conceived and of flexibility with respect to
sub-project selection and implementation (para. 23).

1/  Comparison of actual and forecast costs is of limited usefulness, given
changes (reductions) in the mix of sub-projects constituting the
Project and changes (increases) to the number of categories of sub-
projects eligible for Bank financing with corresponding increases for
disbursement percentages (see paras. 12-14 for details).
ProJect Background
1.       The Third Minas Gerais Water Supply and Sewerage Project, approved
in May 1980, 'ss the eighth Bank loan to Brazil to benefit the water supply
and sewerage sector. The borrower was the National Housing Bank (BNH),
which later (1986) merged with and was absorbed by the Caisa Economica
Federal (CEF); the executing agency was the state water company (SUC)#
Companhia de Saneamento de Minas Gerais (COPASA).
2.       Approximately, twenty years ago, the field of basic sanitation had
a record of very poor performance in terms of services available because,
being the responsibility of the municipalities, they suffered from chronic
underinvestment in human and material resources. In 1971, to increase the
availability of water and sewerage services to the urban population, the
Government launched, under the aegis of BNH, the National Sanitation Plan
(PLANASA) -- a comprehensive program encompassing the design, financing,
construction, and operation of water supply and sewerage services,
technical assistance to SWCs, and the training of their managerial
personnel. The main focus of PLANASA was to help the states to develop
their own organization in the water supply and sewerage sector and to
provide a stable source of financing.
3.       PLANASA made financing available to each.state that entered the
program. To achieve entry, a state had to: (i) sign an agreement with BUR
establishing an SWC that would plan and carry out investments on a
statewide basis for municipalities which turned over their concessions to
the SWC; and (ii) guarantee SRO loans. Further, the state had to pledge 52
of its revenues for PLANASA and establish a state water and sewerage
revolving fund (FAR) to which the state would channel its annual budget
contribution f"r sanftatie'n pprtj.t.  tUnder this arrangement, the states
and BNH each provided 0S of the financing for investment. SWCs were



2
required to provide annually BNH with a five-year investment program and
corresponding financing plan plan (Global Feasibility Study ---EVG).
4.       BNl establlshed a basic line of credit for the water supply and
sewerage sector. Through this line NSN made loans to SWCs (mostly through
state banks) to cover 502 of project costs. BNH maintained three other
credit lineus FINEST I (to help states to cover any shortfall of their SOX
financing obligation), FINEST II (to cover 2 of sub-project costs in small
cities), and FINEST III (to cover 502 of sub-project costs in small
cities). The major source of BNS funds was the Fundo de Garantia do Tenmo
de Servico (FGTS), a national indemnity fund. State government-s were
expected to make budgetary allocations to cover 502 of sub-project costs.
5.       BNB entered Into a contract with the Pan-American Health
Organization (PAHO) to carry out a technical assistance program for
institutional development, standardization of information systems, and
development of a national chart of accounts which all SiCe were to use.
5NH also contracted the Brazilian Association of Sanitary Engineere (ABES)
to develop and implement a program to train the personnel needed to operate
the expanded water and sewerage systems expected to be created under the
PLANASA program. These programs have been very successful in enhancing the
operational and financial capabilities of the SNCs.
6.       During the early and middle 1970's, implementation of the PLANASA
program proceeded at a slower pace than anticipated because it took more
time than expected to oirgauize the SVCe.   e            the reasult were
impressive. In 1975, it wes estimated that about 65-702 of the urban
population had access to potable water supply through house connections.
By 1980, this figure had risen to about 80Z. Another success of PLAPASA
was the introduction in the 1980a of programs for water loss reduction and
operational savings. On the institutional side, PLALASA helped to
strengthen the administrative capabilities of the SWCs in such areas as
accounting, planning, cadastral surveys, etc.
Obiectives
7.       The Bank had made seven prior loans henefitting the sector.  The
achievements of those loans were generally satisfactory (Part III, Schedule
1). It was implicitly expected that Loan 1850-BR would help to consolidate
the achievements of those loans. Loan 1850-BR also was part of a broader
strategy of the Bank to support the efforts of the Government tot (i)
develop projects to improve the living conditions of mostly low-income
people; (ii) support institutional development; and (iii) ease the foreign-
exchange constraints on development. The proposed loan was supposed to
help finance sub-projects and studies consistent with objectives (i) and
(ii); and was by its nature consistent with objective (iii).
Appraisal and Proiect Description
8.       In June 1979 the Government held discussions with the Bank
concerning continuation of Bank participation in the implementation of
PLANASA in the state of Minas Gerais. This operation was conceived along
sectoral lines; and the Loan aimed at helping to finance a-Itime slice"
(1980-1984) of the EVG of COPASA in order to support the expansion/
construction of water-supply systems and sewerages (sub-projects) to be



selected from the EV6 according to agreed criteria. At the time of these
discussions, preparation of eligible sub-projects near Belo iorizonte and
some other towns was already well advanced. Appraisal, negotiations,
approval, and loan signing progressed without major problem (Part III,
Schedule 2).
9.       The Project had three major components.  The component benefitting
the Belo Horizonte area Included3 (a) continued development of the Serra
Azul water source consisting of a treatment plant, main transmission line,
water intake tower, and a pumping station; (b) construction of a dam and
water reservoir on the Rio das Velhas; (c) treated water transmission lines
(d) construction and/or expansion of the water and sewerage-collection
systems. The component benefitting dozens of medium size cities and
hundreds of small communities included the construction and/or expansion of
water-supply and sewage-collection systems. The final component consisted
of technical and institutional Improvement studies.
10.      At appraisal, the state of preparation of the various sub-projects
of this heterogeneous Project ranged from final design and cost estimates
for most of the components benefitting metropolitan Belo Horizonte
(excluding Rio das Velhas), to feasibility studies and construction
schedules for the the medium size cities component, to basic information
and preliminary cost data for the group of small commuities with
construction schedules to be agreed during project implementation. The
definition and approval of sub-projects to be included in the component for
medium-size cities and small communities would take place during project
implementation. To become eligible for Bank financing, these sub-projects
vould have to comply with agreed criteria (respectively, Schedules 1 and A
of the Loan Agreement).
Project Implementationt Effectiveness
11.      Effectiveness of the Loan Agreement was delayed for about eight
months because the Central Bank wanted to subject Loan 1850-BR to the
disbursement regulations applying to foreign commercial loans. Eventually,
after discussion with BNH, the Central Bank abandoned this effort. This
delay adversely affected initial disbursement of the Loan (Part III,
Schedule 3); but did not delay initial construction of the Project.
Proiect Implementation, Timing, Changes, and Cost
12.      Construction proceeded on schedule through 1982, especially with
respect to the Serra Azul water source; but thereafter, it moved more
slowly (Part III, Schedule 4). Part of the slower pace of construction was
due to macroeconomic difficulties starting in 1983 and reactions by the
Government to those difficulties -- restricting investment on the part of
state companies; and part was due to subsequent revaluations which revealed
the fact that populations of some cities of Minas Gerais were growing at
slower rates than had been expected in the census of 1970 and investment
should be shifted to other priority areas. To address these problems,
COPASA, with the agreement of the Bank, changed the allocation of resources
to other works. The Bank also, as part of a larger effort to increase the
flow of foreign exchange to Brazil (the Special Action Program), agreed in
1983 to add to the number of categories of sub-projects eligible for Bank
financing and to increase the corresponding disbursement percentages. The



-4
change with respect to disbursement percentages concentrated Bank finaneing
in fever sub-projects. Other works contemplated as part of the Project
were carried out with local financing but are not included in the cost of
the Project. The Project 'ras largely completed by the end of 1986,
although construction on a modest scale continued into 1987 and
disbursements of Loan 1850-BR, which were suspended through much of 1987
due to problems arising fran the merger of BNH into Caiza Economica
Federal. continued into 1988. To assist COPASA, the Bank agreed to extend
the closing date of the Loan by two and one-half years.
13.      COPASA decided not to carry out the Rio das Velhas sub-project due
to the greater advantages of a competing water source (Rio Manso). In
response to the changing sanitation priorities of the state, COPASA also
modestly shifted the emphasis of sub-projects in favor of water systems as
compared with sewerage (see Part III, Schedule 5 for details on cities and
towns and corresponding water systems and sewerages constructed under the
Project). All of these factors -- macroeconomic, market and technical, and
the changing emphasis of state sanitation priorities -- contributed to an
extension of the implementation period.
14.      The actual cost of the completed Project was US$314 million (Part
III, Schedule 6). Comparison of the actual cost with the appraisal
forecast (US$391.1 million), adjusted for the elimination of the Rio das
Velhas sub-project, is of limited usefulness, due to reductions of the
number and changes in the mix of eligible sub-projects (paras. 12 and 13).
However, comparison of actual and forecast costs of some sub-projects, such
as those benefitting Belo Horizonte, especially the Serra Azul water source
-- US$79.8 million (actual) vs. US$89.7 million (forecast) -- is valid.
All of the proceeds of Loan 1850-BR (US$139 million) were disbursed; they
covered 44.3Z of the project cost as compared with the appraisal forecast
of 35.2.
Results of the EVG and the Proiect
15.      As measured by actual and forecast percentages of the population
with access to water service in 1986, the investment program (EVG) for
1980-1986, which Included the Project, surpassed its expansion targets for
water servicet Belo Horizonte, 90X vs. 83Z; Minas Gerais, 88X vs. 82X.
Customers received potable water subject to frequent analysis. The state
level of sewerage service, 35Z, was on a par with that of Brazil, but below
the appraisal forecast, 402, even though the actual number of at uaal
additional connections exceeded the appraisal forecast and the population
of the state did not reach the level expected at appraisal (Part III,
Schedule 7). The actual and forecast service levels appear to be
inconsistent because more connections for a smaller population should have
resulted in a larger, not a smaller, percentage of population served. In
the opinion of COPASA, the explanation for the inconsistency is due to an
overestimation at appraisal as to the number of people receiving services
per connection.
16.      The Bank was satisfied with the results of the technical study on
measures to protect the catchment area at Serra Azul and a cost-containment
study of COPASA. The Bank received draft terms of reference for a
technical study on mining wastes, but the study was never carried out
because the state government did not resolve differences between its



environment and planning agencies with resweAct to the objectives of the
study.
Perfonmance of Contractors
17.      No disputes with contractors or suppliers delayed implementation.
In the opinion of the Bank, their respective performances were
satisfactory.
Institutional DeveloDment
l8.      At appraisal, the Bank assessed the technical operations and
financial administration of COPASA as satisfactory; and established only
one monitoring indicatir -- namely, the ratio of employees to connections.
As COPASA's efficiency improved steadily, it surpassed the target ratio of
employees to connections in 1986 (Part III, Schedule 6, Item C). To reduce
administrative costs, COPASA carried a study of this problem (para. 16);
and successfully implemented cost reduction measures. Studies and
improvements in this area continue to be made.
Financial Performance of the Executing Agency
19.      Prom 1983 through 1986, the financial performance of COPASA
Improved as measured by: (i) the lessening gap between gross internal cash
generation and debt service; and (il) the improving trend of certain
financial ratios (Part III, Schedule 8). However, during this period, due
to factors outside its control, COPASA failed to comply with the revenue
covenant of the Loan Agreement (Section 5.07), which was based on the
National Tariff Law (NTL) (Part III, Schedule 9).  The revenue covenant
established 1983 as the date by which tariffs would be set at levels
sufficient to produce revenues covering operating costs, including
depreciation, and debt service. There were continuing efforts on the part
of COPASA to improve its financial performance; but in the final analysis,
the sustained high level of inflation overwhelmed such efforts.
Increasingly, the Government came to base its tariff decisions on fighting
inflation rather than such considerations as the financial needs of the
operating companies of the sector, upholding the NTL, or complying with
agreements with the Bank.
20.      For the period as a whole, summary water sales (1940 m3 millions)
were 11.91 below the forecast level (2202 m3 millions) as a result of
lower-than-forecast growth of population in the state; but actual and
forecast summary average revenue per cubic meter of water sold were close:
0.019 UPCs vs. 0.018 UPCs. Total summary revenues amounted to 53.1
millions of UPCs as compared with the forecast level of 57.6 millions of
UPCs. However, because cash operating expenses (47.1 millions of UPCs)
were over 512 above forecast (27.1 millions of UPCs) primarily due to high
labor costs, actual gross internal cash generation, 16.6 millions of UPCs
(after adjustments), was 44.92 below the forecast level, 30.1 millions of
UPCs. During this period, as compared with forecast levels, COPASA covered
additional funding requirements for investments and other applications
(56.3 millions of UPCs) and a shortfall of net internal cash generation
adjusted for differences due to foreign exchange (9.7 millions of UPCs)
with additional equity contributions (24.0 millions of UPCs) and borrowings
(42.0 millions of UPCs).



- 6 -
21.      As Brazil was struggling with serious macroeconocac problems and
as COPASA was making every effort to improve its financial performance, the
Bank did not resort to normal remedies for non-compliance. Tariff levels
and the financing problems of the sector occupied much of the efforts of
supervision missions; and In 1987 and 1988, the finsncial performace of
COPASA shoved marked improvement, which was reflected by the internal rate
of return (8.9S) on the investment program carried out between 1980 and
1988 in the Belo Horizonte area (Part III, Schedule 10). Given the
importance of this market to COPASA, this rate of return is considered to
be indicative for the internal rate of return for the entire investment
program for 1980-1988.
Performances of the Banks the Borrower, and the Executing Agency
22.      The Bank agreed to amend the Loan Agreement to create a Special
Account at the Central Bank to increase the disbursement percentage for
eligible sub-projects, to change disbursement by categories, and to extend
the closing date of the Loan (Part III, Schedules 11 & 12). With these
amendments, the Bank demonstrated flexibility in its dealings with BNS and
COPASA, which were operating in a difficult economic environment beginning
In 1983 and which were subjected to financing and investment restrictions
on the part of the Government (para. 12). Among other things, these
amendments reflected the attempt by the Bank to accoaodate the Government,
which was struggling with complex macroeconomic problems. The level of
field supervision of the Project and the loan, which was light, was
appropriate (Part III, Schedule 13). From the point of view of the
Bank,relations with BNB (and later CEF) and COPASA were cordial and
professional; and their respective performances were satisfactory.
Lessons to be Learned
23.      To take account of shifting priorities of its market and
operations, the Loan Agreement provided COPASA with substantial flexibility
In selecting and carrying out eligible sub-projects included in its EVO
(para. 10). With the agreement of the Bank, COPASA took full advantage of
this provision during the course of implementation (paras.12-14). In so
fae as there is a lesson to be learned from this Project, it is concerned
with the value of designing this operation along sectoral lines and the
resulting flexibility with respect to sub-project selection.

created the Sanitatlon Financing System (SFS) and Implemented the Natlonal Snltation Plan
(PUAWSA), which *st forth guidelines for project design and economei evaluation; and which
made financing available to sech state adhering to It. The major souceo of funding for PLANASA and
SFS Is the Employee Indumnity Fund (MMTS), which In financed by an 8 payroll contribution from
all employee covered by labor legislation. PLAMASA requires each state to: (t) establish a
Stat* War Company (SIC) with state-wide responbi lities and a water and sewerag fund (FAE)
to channel state funds to Individual companio; and (ii) Caue  Its SJC to furnish DM  annually

Event             Date
(i) Appraisal
Missions      11/09/79      The appraisal and subsequent project
processing moved smoothly. Conceived
(ii)  Negotia-      04114180      along sector lines, the Project consisted
tions                       of eligible water and sewerage sub-
projects               selected according
(iii)  Board         05122180      to agreed criteria to benefit metropoli-
Approvals                   tan Belo Horizonte, medium-size cities,
and small communities. No major problems
delayed negotiations, board approval, and
loan signing.
B. Project Execution
(v) Effectivenessi
(a) Actual    05/28/81     Effectiveness was delayed for eight (8)
months, as the BNH experienced difficulty
in registering the agreement with the
(b) Revised   06/23/81      Central Bank (a standard condition of
04/23/81     effectiveness).  In a departure from its
02/23/81     policy of exempting Bank loans, the
12123/80     Central Bank attempted to apply to Loan
1850-BR regulations requiring the:
(c) Planned   10/21/80      (i) deposit of disbursements from foreign
loans in banks authorized to engage in
foreign currency transactions; and (ii)
release of such deposits according to an
established schedule -- that is, 202
after 150 days, 402 after 180 days, and
402 after 210     days. These regulations
had applied to the loans of commercial
banks, but not to prior Bank loans.
Eventually, after discussions with BNH,
the Central Bank registered Loan 1850-BR
without applying the above regulations.
To Bank staff, the rationale for the
dispute was not clear. Although
completion of the Project was late (24
mos. -- see below), delayed loan
effectiveness was not a factor.
(vi) Project Completions
(a) Actual    06/30/89     Execution of the Project proceeded as
planned through 1982, but in 1983,
(b) Revised   06/30/87      construction began to slow because of the

Proect Coulotion (Contd.)
Ic) Planned   12131184     macroeconomic problems of the country
andthe effort of Government to reduce
investment on the part of public
enterprises. Instead of defining the
Project in precise physical terms, the
Loan Agreement defined the Project as
consisting of sub-projects approved and
selected according to agreed criteria.
Given such flexibility COPASA changed the
mix of sub-projects constituting the
Project with Bank agreement without
formal amendment of the project
definition in the Loan Agreement.
Notwithstanding such changes, all of the
proceeds of Loan 1850-BR (US$139 million)
were disbursed because the Bank agreed to
increase the disbursement percentages of
the various sub-projects. By the end of
1986, in most respects, COPASA completed
the Project, although construction on a
small scale continued into 1987; and the
last disbursement of the loan occurred In
1988.
(vii) Closing Dates:
(a) Actual    12131187*    Because of delays in project execution
beginning in 1983 (see above), the Bank
(b) Revised   12131/87     agreed (07/20/85) to a provisional
12131186     extension of the closing date to allow
12131/85     full commltment of the proceeds of the
Loan by the end of 1985. As a supervision
(c) Planned   06130185     mission (10185) accepted the plan of
COPASA to complete the Project by 06187,
the Bank agreed (03/20/86) to extend the
closing date to 12131186. Just prior to
this agreed date, the Government dis-
solved (11/21186) BNH, transferred its
functions, personnel, and obligations to
CEF, and requested the Bank to amend the
Loan Agreement to recognize such
transfer. The Government further informed
the Bank that it would suspend utilizing
the Special Account and presenting
disbursement applications until the Bank
amended the Loan Agreement as requested.
Following the Bank's assessment of

disbursements 02/03188.           of BIN,  CLF signed (11118187) a Loan
Assumption Agreement, establishing
12131187 as the closing date.

Mr. Alexander Nowicki
Operations Evaluation Department. World Bank
WASHINGTON- D.C. 20433
Subject:  Third Minas Gerais Water Suolv and Sewerage Project
Dear Sir:
In accordance with the request in your letter of November 14,
1989, we annex our comments regarding the Third Min"s Gerais Water Supply and
Sewerage Project (Loan 1850-BR), which was successful in promoting the
expansion of these services in the state of Hinas Gerais.
We hope that our comments regarding the lessons to be drawn may
help to make operations of this kind even more effective. I am at your
disposal for any additional information you may need.
Yours sincerely,
/s/ Alipio Pires Castello Branco
Chairman

ANNEX 1
*PgeZof 6
BRAZIL: LOAN 1850-BR
I.          OZrign of flaids
The objectives of the project were to promote the attainment'of
National Sanitation Plan (PLANASA) goals in Minas Gerais by expanding the
water supply system in the Belo Horizonte Metropolitan Region (B lR), modium-
sized cities and small communities, and expanding and upgrading the sewerage
network in the BHEM (part 1, para. 9, page 3). It should be noted that the
project area is the third most Industrialized region in Brazil.
The National Housing Bank (BNH), later replaced by the Caixa
Rcon6mica Federal (CEF), was the borrower, in the amount of US$139 million,
which was onlent to the benefioiary, COPASA-KG, for project execution.
II.         ,Program I3DemSDnatlon
The Third Minas Gerais Water Supply and Sewerage Project was
completed about two years after the closing date estimated during the
appraisal. The delay was principally due to macroeconomic problems in Brazil
and to the major effort made by the Government to reduce investment by some
public enterprises as a way of fighting inflation (part 1, para. 12, page 3).
It was also necessary to make certain adjustments to the project
(part 1, para. 13, page 4) in order to achieve an optimum distribution of
water production and greater operational reliability and safety throughout the
BHKR, given that the Rio das Velhas provides about 70 percent of the region's
water supply (it should be remembered that the break in the purified water
pipeline left Belo Horizonte without water for about 100 hours in 1984,
thereby confirming this choice). As regards medium-sized and small towns,
adjustments had to be made to the initial classification in light of priority
technical and operational requirements.
III.        Bank Missions
The various missions sent by the Bank during the loan period
(part 3, para. 13, page 26) basically assessed the need for adjustments to the
targets set in light of new facts. The missions visited both the borrower and
the beneficiary; meetings were held at company headquarters and technical
inspections were made of the works.
The beneficiary provided assistance at these meetings by making
technical personnel available to meet requests for information. However,
COPASA-MG felt the lack of regular programming as regards mission schedules
and the lack of continuity among the technical experts sent by the Bank.
The lack of standard criteria for data and information collection
greatly hampered the preparation of interim and/or final reports by Bank
missions, given the constant changes in administrative personnel in the
company.

Among the positive foatures mst be mentioned the great
flexibility shown by Bank specialists in altering some projects 8S a result of
urgent and priority ne4s (part 3, par&. 12, page 26).
IV.         ZM_M       =hAM r
During the loan period, all projects were analyzed and approved by
CETEC, as the technal  agency of CEF/BNH, until it wa eliminated from the
process as a result of the company's own maturity, the aim being to reduce
fitincial costs and to keep the tim  spent on such analyses to a minimum.
V.           he lorrower (BMR/CE
BNH WaS established to support social programs involving the
construction of housing and urban infrastructure, which included sanitation
because of its great importance in economic, social and public health terms.
Given this objective, water supply and sewerage companies had access to BNH
and received such financial and technical support as was compatible with their
requests, in order to fulfil the goals established by PLANASA.
The situation changed when BNH disappeared and its
responsibilities were transferred to the CEP. Under neither arrangement,
however, did the company participate in discussions on its requests for
financing under Loan 1850-BR, having la priori" no say in deciding the origin
of the funds, since the loan represented the CEF/BNH contribution to the
resources available for investment in sanitation.
VI.         the Beneficiarv
Throughout the loan period, COPASA-MG sought to overcome the
shortcomings that had affected previous loans (1009-BR and 1309-BR). A number
of measures were taken, including the elimination of weaknesses in subproject
preparation through tighter and more objective supervision of consulting firms
and better internal coordination of departments involved in subprojects.
Outside firms were contracted for the preparation of technical
plans and works execution, and, when necessary, for advice on and inspection
of works. The beneficiary closely supervised the work carried out by these
firms to ensure that they fulfilled the basic guidelines for subprojects; it
also worked to improve performance evaluation procedures and took care to
ensure that sound choices were made from among the available firms in the
market.
VII.        Institutional De19mnt
Following the guidelines set out by PRODISAN, the company prepared
its Haster Plan for Institutional Development in 1981, which was in effect
through 1985. Programs are currently being implemented to strengthen the
company through effective training programs for core staff, the goals being
higher productivity, greater efficiency and lower operating costs (part 1,
para. 18, page 5). The Development and Operational Control program has been
under study since 1979. It has been implemented systematically since 1983,

tho objective belft to reduce losses by around 25 percent by December 1995 for
the entire rae of syst. opersted by the company.
VII.             Sam- C      actors ad SU ie
The company contracts outsLde firms to prepare technical designs,
executo works r*m supply materials. On the whole their performce should be
regarded as satisfactory, especially in light of the qualLty and prompt
arrival of the products supplied.
XX.         Lessons to be L&&Md
Experience under the earlier loans (1009-BR and 1309-BR), which
raised questions about the performance of contractors, led COPASA-Mo to look
for firms wlth appropriately specialized technical qualifications, involving
the establishLent of stricter criterLa, standardization of projects, and
closer oversight and sonitoring of work; this produced a better response to
the company's requiremnts and improved the observance of contractual
deadllnes. It is important to stress that Bank missions made a decisive
contribution on the question of the company's need to charge realistic tariffs
in order to cover its costs. The mission spared no effort to achieve this
objective and shoved every willingness to discuss the matter with the
Brazilian authorities (part 3, para. 13, note 1, page 27). We should also
mention the great flexibility shown by the Bank during the reassessment of the
project, which led to an increase in its share of investments (part 3,
para. 11, page 25).
X.          Priect_Costs
As regards projected and actual overall project costs, the
following points should be made:
-     Practically nothing of what was planned for the Rio das Velhas was
implemented, leaving 2.6 million UPC available from this
component;
-     the financial performance of the program' fell somewhat short of
the projections and the closing date was 2 years later than
planned;
-     in 1983 the Central Bank issued Resolution No. 381/83, which
virtually paralyzed any attempts to raise new funds and seriously
affected the 1983 and 1984 investment programs. -Disbursements
were therefore increased in the following years (1985/86) when the
Resolution was relaxed, since COPASA-KG had a pipeline of projects
whose normal progress was being prejudiced by its lack of funds;
T.N.: This may refer to COPASA'S own financial performance, though that
is not how it is written.

-     during this poriod, the Bar1k's contributions to various potential
components (e.g. FINEST, CTE, etc.) were renegotiated and
increased, in view of the situation referred to above;
*     applications for financing were processed during supervision
missions by Bank specialists in conjunction with BNH/CEF experts.
COPASA-Ht did not participate in these discussions;
-     the cost increases in the Serra Azul complex were thoroughly
discussed with Bank missions during execution of Loan 1850-BR.
COPASA-NG believes that these explanations, no doubt contained in
the reports by the missions in question, were fully accepted by
the Bank. The company does not have the data that went into these
reports, since they were prepared purely as part of the
supervision process.
X1.         Growth of the Beneficiary (1980/86)
Throughout COPASA-MG's existence there have been regular changes
in its top management, generally coinciding with changes in the State
government. Nonetheless, the company has continued to develop, as can be seen
from the attached table. This shows that the population supplied [with
water]  was 96.5 percent larger in 1986 than in 1979 while the population
receiving [sewerage]" service increased 102.5 percent over the same period.
It can therefore be concluded that there has been a significant increase in
the level of coverage provided by COPASA-MG. Water production in 1986 was
107.9 percent greater than in 1979.
The Bank's involvement has been of fundamental importance for the
achievement of these objectives. This level of coverage could not have been
attained had not COPASA-MG, since its establishment, attached proper
importance to constructing and expanding the water supply system for the
Metropolitan Region of Belo Horizonte.
Xll.        Conclusions
The project was very successful in contributing to the expansion
of water supply and sewerage services in the state of Minas Gerais.  The
principal lesson to be drawn relates to the planning of the physical aspects
of the project. Loan 1850-BR generated, within COPASA-MG and BNH,
subsequently replaced by CEF, a greater awareness of the problems also faced
by smaller communities. During this process, BNH/CEF used a flexible approach
to adapt planned systems to urgent and pressing local needs.
**T.N.: These are guesses; see also the Table.
