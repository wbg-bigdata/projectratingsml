1.        I subh:it tbe follouling report and recormendation on a nroposed loan
-to Societe d'Tnergie et d'Eau du Gabon with the guarantee of the Government
for the equivalent of Us$Q.5jmillion to help finance a project for the extension
and ii.nrovement of the water supply system of Libreville.   The Loan will have
a term of 25 years, including  4 years of grace, with interest at 7 1/4 percent
p.er annuM.  The Caisse Centrale de Cooperation Economique (CCCE) will make a
loan for tl:e same project. equivalent to US$4.3 million, for 17 years with 4
years of -race and with interest at 5 percent per annum.
PART I - THE ECONOM1Y
2.        The Report entitled 'The Current Economic Situation and Prospects
of Gabon", 'No. ATJ- 99a was distributed to Executive Directors on Decem.ber 17,
1971.  A mission in Novenher/December 1972 reviewed recent developments,
particularly in the field of public finance; its findings are reflected in
this section and the country data in Annex 1.
3.        Gabon, half the size of France, has a population of about 500,000.
Its econorn c growYth in recent years has been impressive -- an average annual
rate of 11 percent in current prices, or 6-7 percent in real terms. Gabon's
growth is primarily hased on the output of its export industries, e.g. oil,
timber, manganese, and uranium.   As a result of the expl.oitation of these
resources, per canita GDP in 1971 reached about U'.$900, the third highest
in Africa. Gabon's exnort industries are largely built withi foreign private
capital anri managed by expatriates.  A considerable part of the income from
modern sector production is transferred abroad. Thus, per capita GYP is
significnntly belowq UgW)O.
4.        The rise in petroleun; production, now exceeding 6 million tons a
year, and in petroleum prices was the most ir,portant factor contributing to
recent economic growth.   Petroleoum accounts for an estimated 28 percent of
GDP.  Timber production, which accounts for 8 percent of GDP, has recently
increased at a yearly rate of 5 percent. 'Manganese output, which accounts
for close to 10 percent of CDP, reached 2 million tons last year.    Another
major factor in the rise of value added has been the high rate of public
wo rlk s .
5.        Ranid economic growth has drawn an increasing part of the popula-
tion into the miodern urban sector.  In fact, almost one third of the popU-
lation now depends o-n this setctor For its li.velihood, an unusually high



percentns-e For Africa.  Increasin,, emnloy-,ent opportunities have attracted more
andl  ore Feople from the countryside to thie oities.  However, rapid urbaniza-
tion has c re-ted' demalnin's for piibl ic servirc.c hi7ch arc far from being- net.
rvly one qlnarter of TiLTrevill-?'s dwellings, largely upper-cla-ss, have elec-
t-ricity anol water connections.  For the l ass of urban dwellersr In Librevil.le,
imnrovement in living conditions has not kept pace witlh rising incomes.
6>.       The  evpeiorment potential of Cahon lies primmarily in the continued
P.x:loit.tior. of its natural resources nodl the profits wbiclh Gabon can retain
fror thlis exnJoitation for use in hiTh--rioritv investrents.   Cabon's forest
reso1mrcfs arc a.on- th-e ric;est in Africa and include a near monopolv of tbe
O12''{' tr" , wh.ich comr,ndn, hiigh prices i.r urore.  There is potential for
domestic procc,ssinr of lo-,s for export to Furone.  Manganese output couldl
hc .-lotdl.lec} to nf -.ilio-i tons bny thme early 1V'8r's withi a0ditions to the
transrort srutclo. ude oil oroduction could increasr bo-ond the present
level oF   m .-illion tons to alicut 10 million tons a year due to recent dis-
coverLes.  Cabon has lr-ne untappocd resources of iror. ore.  On the other
Ehard, agriciilt.re, tl-e T:.ainstci' of msct African economies, has on).ly limited
develoonrr' t possihiliti,.  DevelopTet1t of modern ag,riculture is hindered

tion densitv in rural] areas which makes thie cost of adequate road infrastruc-
Lure aric. utcrr.sicvu services alitost prolhibitive.
7.        The major constraint to the exploitation of Gabon's resource poten-
tial is the lack of adequate transportation.   In the immediate future Gabon 's
transport network needs considerable expansion to serve forestry reserves.
Should a decision be made to exploit iron ore deposits inland, additional
transport facilities would be required.   It was with this exploitation in mind
that the Gabonese Government has made the construction of a railroad from the
port of Owendo to Booue (337 km inland) the centerpiece of its investment
program. Eventually the railroad would be extended to Belinga, the site of
imnortant iron ore deposits, with a connection to Moanda where an expansion
of manganese exploitation is envisaged.
3.        Anoth er mainr develonmmrt constraint is the shortaQ,e of workers
and1 mzna'0rn to rieet the labor cema,nr,ds of th-e modern sectnr, and to increase
C:ibonr.cn  niart:icin.,ti.on in thlic  rig, mnt of tle economy.  There i,s a par-

a.        Gabon's current fivea-year Plan (1971-75) calls for public investments
of CIMP 65 billion: CFAF ?.".7 billion of x4hich will be provided by Gabonese
nublic funrds and' ChA F 3). 7, by e-.ternal firancinp.  The, Banl:'s last economic
report, V-AT2Ca, datted Decerber 21, 1971, estimated that public investnent of
between C(AF 46 and 48 billion wotld be more in line with financial avail-
abil.i-ties and Cabon's absorptive capacity.



-3-
10.       Financing such a reduced program of public investments would still
require a major fiscal effort. In recent years, Gabon has had an enviable
record of rising current public savings before debt service. Current revenues
rose by 16 and 18 percent annually in 1971 and 1972 respectively, largely due
to petroleum taxation, leading to an estimated current budget surplus (before
debt service) of 24 percent of revenues in these years. However, the Govern-
ment has carried out an ambitious investment program partly financed by
suppliers credits and short-term borrowings. Gabon's debt has risen steeply
and debt service payments may exceed current budget surpluses. According
to recent staff estimates the ratio of debt service to current revenues may
be higher than 29 percent in 1973, and an overall budget deficit is likely
this year. Even assuming some refinancing of existing short-term debt, new
commitments for Plan objectives will have to remain modest. Continuation of
present budgetary trends would deprive Gabon of resources required for high-
priority investments. Hence, it is imperative to more closely evaluate
future investment projects for their impact on development and Government
revenues, to refinance the large short-term debt, and to curb future suppliers
credits. Policies to this effect are being discussed with the Government
which has indicated a willingness to consider austerity measures. Given the
favorable prospects for further increases in revenues, the possibilities for
cutting expenditures, and the short-term nature of most of Gabon's debt, the
fiscal situation appears manageable if remedial action is taken soon.
11.       In view of its strong export position and prospects, its record
public savings and its potential for further growth, Gabon is creditworthy
for the proposed loan.
PART II - BANK GROUP OPERATIONS IN GABON
12.       Annex II contains a summary statement of Bank loans as bf February 28,
1973 and notes on the execution of ongoing projects.
13.       Our first operation was a 1959 Bank loan of US$35 million to
COMILOG, a mining company which helped finance construction of facilities
to extract and transport ore from a manganese mine at Moanda in Southern
Gabon to the Ocean port of Pointe Noire in the People's Republic of the
Congo. The project is operating successfully and COMILOG prepaid the Bank
loan last year. After independence, the emphasis in Bank lending was on
transport infrastructure. Two loans, one of US$12 million in 1964 and
another of US$6 million in 1969, financed the construction of roads to
open up new forest areas for timber production and to promote general devel-
opment in these areas. Construction of the roads has been completed, the
quality of the work is good, and a surplus under the 1969 loan is being used
to strengthen the Government's road maintenance capability.
14.       In 1968, the Bank began to widen its assistance to Gabon and to
tackle the human resource constraint.   A loan of US$1.8 million helped improve
primary and secondary teacher training, vocational training, and secondary



- 4 -
education. Despite some initial delays in implementation the project is
now completed. A joint UNESCO/Bank identification mission has returned
from Gabon to formulate a second education project. This project is likely
to emphasize rural and technical professional training and could be presented
to the Board in 1974.
15.       The largest project ever considered by the Bank in Gabon is the
Owendo-Booue railroad project. This project consists of a 337 km heavy-duty
track from Owendo to Booue as the first section of the Owendo-Belinga rail-
road (about 260 km), feeder roads, and timber port facilities at Owendo.
A recently completed appraisal of the project concluded that without reason-
able assurance that the iron ore mine at Belinga would be opened in the near
future, construction of the railroad now would be premature. If transport
facilities are developed mainly to serve new forest areas, a river/road pro-
ject is the most economical alternative. At a considerably lower investment
cost, it would yield a very high proportion of the logging benefits which
would be generated by the railroad. The Gabonese Government was recently in-
formed of our conclusions but does not appear prepared to accept them.
16.       If the railroad is constructed and its financing plan requires a
substantial equity contribution by Gabon and a heavy debt service burden for
the country, Gabon's ability to contribute to other projects would be severely
curtailed. This would limit future Bank lending to Gabon to a minimum program
of urgently needed social investments such as the proposed water supply proj-
ect and possibly another education project as identified by the recent Bank/
UNESCO mission (paragraph 14). Conversely, if Gabon decides to postpone con-
struction of the railroad or manages to finance a high proportion of the rail-
road investment through foreign grants and soft loans, a larger Bank lending
program could be considered.
PART III - THE PUBLIC UTILITIES SECTOR
17.       Urbanization in Gabon has been rapid.   Between 1960 and 1970,
the number of people living in settlements of 2,000 inhabitants and above
rose from 74,000 to 160,000. The population is heavily concentrated in
two towns:  Libreville which has 90,000 inhabitants, and Port Gentil, with
45,000. While the average population growth of the whole country is only
about 1 percent, the population in a city like Libreville increases at an
average annual rate of 7 percent or more. Thus, the capital annually absorbs
1-2 percent of the entire population of Gabon.
18.       The rural exodus to the coastal cities has outpaced the availability
of urban services, especially water and sewerage. Libreville's population
is poorly served with potable water and sanitation conditions are bad,
especially in the lower-income areas. The only organized drainage and
sewerage system is limited to the center of Libreville; for the rest of the
citv, drainage is by ditches and streams which flow into the sea.   The Govern-
ment has requested that UNDP finance a 2 1/2-year pre-investment study for



drainage and sewerage in Libreville.   The study is expected to start in mid-
1973, and will be carried out by the World Health Organization (WHO).
19.       The proposed project, joint work by SEEG, the Government, Caisse
Centrale, and Bank preparation missions, is designed to tackle the water
problem.  At present only one-forth of Libreville's population have household
water connections. Lower income groups are served by about 40 public stand-
pipes located mainly in areas with some planned infrastructure. Squatter
settlements are not provided with piped water, and their inhabitants use pol-
luted and contaminated water sources (rainwater, ponds, and nearby streams)
and are exposed to water-borne diseases. As a result, infant mortality is
exceptionaltv high, and the productivity of a large part of the labor force
is impaired.
20.       SEEG, a concessionary company with a majority government partici-
pation, has the monopoly of the water (and power) supply in Gabon under
French-type concessions.   The Government or local authorities own the in-
stallations which SEEG maintains and operates. SEEG levies its own rates
on power and water consumption and, on behalf of the Government and local
authorities, collect surchages to cover investment costs. SEEG is well
man-aged and quite capable of executing the project.
21.       If present trends continue, we expect that by 1980 more than half
of Gabon's population will live in two cities, Libreville and Port Gentil.
This makes it imperative to rationally plan urban infrastructure. There
is now no comprehensive plan for the development of the capital. Libreville
is spread over a large area, and the scattered, disorganized housing pattern
makes it expensive to construct the necessary urban infrastructure such as
roads, water supply, drainage, and sewerage. A comprehensive plan for the
development of Libreville is required and the Government will begin such a
study in conjunction with the Libreville Water Supply Project.
22.       SEEG is also responsible for power and water supply in other cities
and rural centers in the rest of Gabon. It is subsidizing the operations of
these facilities from its own revenue and has indicated its intention to con-
tinue this practice. At request of the Government, it has been developing
public utility facilities in selected rural centers which are growing rapidly.
PART IV - THE PROJECT
23.       Libreville's water supply originally came from local springs.    With
increasing demand, water had to be brought from the N'toum area, 40 km from
Libreville. It is now expected that peak demand will start exceeding supplv
in late 1973.



-6-
24.       The proposed project is designed to meet Libreville's estimated
consumption until 1979 and to improve distribution. The project was pre-
pared by SEEG's consultants, SEURECA, in close cooperation with the Bank.
The project was appraised 1/ in May/June 1972, and updated in December 1972.
Negotiations for the loan were held in Washington with a Gabonese delegation
headed by the Gabonese Ambassador to Washington. CCCE was also represented
at these meetings.
Description of the Project
25.       The project will consist of the following pTincipal elements:
a)   a river diversion scheme, consisting of a weir, a pumping
station, a pipeline, a power transmission line, and a
transformer station;
b)   expansion onf a raw water and clear water pumping station
and a water treatment plant at N'toum and a transformer
station;
c)   a 40 km treated water pipeline paralleling the existing
pipeline between N'toum and Libreville;
d)   a storage reservoir to supplement the two existing smaller
tanks at the head of the distribution system in Libreville,
and about 1S km of distribution mains;
e)   miscellaneous minor distribution works to improve water
supply to low-income quarters of the city; and
f)   consultant 's services for detailed engineering, consultant's
and SEEG's services for supervision of construction.
The project is expected to be in service by 1975, except for the river diver-
sio-n scleme Which will be completed in 1976.
26.       The project wrill increase overall water supply for Libreville
and provide nore water for the 75 percent of Libreville's population which
now have at best inadequate access to potable water. High water prices,
high connection charges, and long distances to the few public standpipes
lhave discouraged lower income groups from using piped water.  SEEG and the
Municipality of Libreville have agreed to extend the distribution system,
as part of the project, to serve approximately 90 percent of the city's
population by 1976 and in particular:
(a)  to increase the number of public standpipes fromi 40 to 100;
(b)  to reduce water charges by 60 percent for the first 5 m 3month
per house connection and, concurrently, to increase water
charpes for all consumers of more than 16 m3/month to better
reflect long-term economic costs; and
1/   Appraisal Rleport No. 89a-GA dated April 10, 1973 is being circulated
separatelv to the Executive Directcrs. A Loan and Project Summary is
given in Annex III of this report.



-7-
(c) to facilitate the provision of house connections to the
lower and middle income population by eliminating the
monthly maintenance charges for meters and connections,
and by spreading payment of the connection charges over
several years.
27.       Total cost of the project is estimated at US$19.9 million equiva-
lent, with a total foreign exchange component of US$14.3 million. The fol-
lowing table shows the breakdown of cost items.

28.       It is proposed that the Bank finance US$9.5 million or 48 percent
of total cost; CCCE, US$4.3 million or 22 percent; the Government, US$5.2
million or 26 percent; and Municipality and SEEG, IJS$0.9 million or 4 per-
cent. The Bank loan corresponds to 66 percent of the estimated foreign
exchange cost of US$14.3 million. The CCCE loan will be for 17 years with
4 years' grace and 5 percent annual interest. The Government contribution
will be a grant to the MIunicipality.
Administrative Arrangements -- Tariff and Financial Policies
29.       SEEG will be the borrower, while the Minicipality will become the
owner of the installations in accordance with the concession system. SEEG
would execute the project and be fully responsible for its technical and
financial operations, including administration of the debt service.
30.       Because the concession under which SEEC operates involves the Gov-
ernment and the Libreville Municipality, agreement on many issues necessarily
had to be reached by the Bank with all three parties, in separate documents:



-- 8 -
the Loan Agreement with SEEG, the Guarantee Agreement with the Government,
and the Libreville Agreement with the Municipality.
31.       The Government, the Municipality and SEEG have agreed to set and
maintain adequate water tariffs for power and water supply in Gabon so that
thie return on gross fixed assets would be at least 7 percent for all assets
and 8 percent for the Libreville water supply assets (except in 1975-77 when
7 percent would be acceptable). Also they will consult with the Bank regard-
ing the yearly investment programs for Libreville water supply, and regarding
financing plans for all major investments in the power and water sectors of
US$2 million or more. SEEG has agreed on a debt service covenant providing
that net revenues of the previous fiscal year must be at least 1.2 times cur-
rent debt service, and it has also agreed not to distribute dividends of more
than 5 percent on the value of its share capital.
Economic Justification
32.       The project makes possible the provision of an adequate supply of
potable water to meet the rising needs of Libreville for household, indus-
trial, and commercial consumption. It will make a direct contribution to
improvement of living conditions in Cabons' most important urban center and,
through increased productivity, to the national economy. Adequate supply of
potable water will reduce the incidence of water-borne diseases and increase
the effective supply of labor in a country where practically every able-
bodied man can find employment.
33.       The return on the investment is expected to be at least 10 per-
cent. This estimate does not take into account other economic benefits
that cannot be quantified, i.e. increased productivity, public health im-
provements, etc.
Procurement and Disbursement
34.       Except for minor works (3 percent of total project cost), pro-
curement for all civil works and equipment will be by international com-
petitive bidding. The Government has requested domestic preferences of 15
percent for purchase of materials and equipment. For convenience in disburse-
ment, the Bank will cover   48 percent of total expenditures under each project
category, and CCCE 22 percent.
PART V - LEGAL INSTRUMENTS AND AUTHORI[TY
35.       The draft Loan Agreement between the Bank and Societe d'Energie
et d'Eau du Cabon, the draft Guarantee Agreement between the Gabonese Republic
and the Bank, the draft Libreville Agreement between the Municipality of
Libreville and tihe Bank, the Report of the Committee provided for in Article
III, Section 4 (iii) of the Articles of Agreement and the text of a draft
resolution approving the proposed Loan are being distributed to the Executive
Directors separately.

36.       The draft Loan Agreement for the Libreville Water Supply Project
contains covenants usually found in the Bank's Agreements for water projects.
The major features of the draft Loan Agreement have already been described in
this report. In addition, the following features are of particular interest:
a)   the effectiveness of the Caisse Centrale Loan Agreement
and approval of the extension of the company's corporate
life by the company's shareholders meeting and an arrange-
ment between the Government and the Caisse Autonome
d'Amortissement du Gabon for disbursing the Gov-
ernment contribution are made additional conditions to the
effectiveness of the Loan Agreement (Section 9.01 of the
Loan Agreement); and
b)   provisions are made for the suspension of disbursements and
acceleration of repayment of the Bank Loan in connection
with the suspension of disbursements or acceleration of
repayment of the Caisse Centrale Loan (Section 8.02 (a), (b)
and (c) and 8.03 of the Loan Agreement).
37.       I am satisfied that the proposed loan would comply with the Articles
of Agreement of the Bank.
PART VI - RECOMIENDATION
38.       I recommend that the Executive Directors approve the proposed Loan.

B.   PROJECTS IN EXECUTION
Performance under existing loans and credits has been satisfactory,
but not without difficulties.
Education Project; US$1.8 million, Loan No. 540 of June 7, 1968
to Government; Closing Date: June 30, 1973; Project implementation was
generally satisfactory. Construction of secondary schools was completed in
1971 and the teacher training college was completed in 1972. The remaining
site improvements will be completed by June 1973. Delays were encountered
in procuring teaching equipment. There were cost overruns on various con-
struction works.  Savings on furniture and equipment more than offset the
cost overruns on construction. We anticipate that, after the completion of
the remaining site improvement -- and hence the origi.nal project -- US$130,000
will remain undisbursed. It is proposed that part of this amount be allocated
for preparation of the second education project.
Second Highwav Project: US$6.0 million, Loan No. 580 of January
10, 1969 to Government; ClosingDate:    December 31, 1973.  This project has
been completed except for the procurement of road maintenance equipment. The
Government has consulted the Bank on bid results and is in the process of
acquiring the equipment.
