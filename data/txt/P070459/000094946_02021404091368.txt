A. BACKGROUND
1. The Inner Mongolia Highway Project contains the following two parts:
(1) Laoyemiao-Jining highway is main route (see Fig2-la(l), for more detail see Fig2-la(2));
(2) The llighway Network Improvement Program in the poverty area of Inner Mongolia Higliway
Project (HNIP): of 5 roads(See Fig2-i b).
The EIS of Laoyemiao-Jining Highway was compiled by Xi'an Highway University. In January
1999, the unit compiled the TOR of EIA for the project. In June 1999, the SEPA gave a reply on the
review of the TOR. In December 1999, and it worked out the first edition of the EIS.
In June 2000, the Environmental Protection Office of the MOC held a preview meeting on the EIS in
Beijing. Based on the new edition of the "Project Feasibility Study Report of Laoyemiao-Jining Highway"
of February 2001, a new EIS was completed in September, 2001. (edition for review & approval ). In
October 2001, the second edition was finished (revision). In January 2002, this edition (third) was finished
according to the World Bank comments (Dec. 5, 2001).
The EIA work for the HNIP Road, is held by Inner Mongolia Environimental Science Institute.
Theyvve drawn out the EIA report in August 2001, and second edition in October. 2001(Revision).
2.The process of environmental review involve from various institutions in Inner Mongolia Region,
including IMEPB, Ulanqab League El Monitoring Station, Meteorology Division of Inner Mongolia.
The affected groups and NGOs along the highway, and the people subject to resettlement and land
acquisition in particular, have been consulted.
3.The policy and administrative requirements for environmental assessment of development projects in
China were followed during preparation and evaluation of EIA, as well as the World Banks
OP/BP/GP4.01 on the Environmental Assessment (In Annex 2). The major regulations to follow are as
follows:
Law of Environmental Protection, People's Republic of China (PRC) December, 1989;
Law of Atmospheric Pollution Control, PRC;
Law of Water Pollution Control, PRC
Regulations for Noise Pollution Control, PRC
Law of Soil Conservation, PRC

State Council, No.253 (98);
Measures for Environmental Protection Management of Highway Construction Projects, issued by
Ministry of Communications (MOC) No 17,(90);
Technical Specifications for Soil Conservation Plan in Development Construction Projects, issued
by Water Conservancy Ministry, May, 1998, (SL204-98);
Regulations for EIA for Highway Construction Projects, issued by MOC, January, 1996,
(JTJO05-96);
Technical Guidelines for EIA, issued by the National Environmental Protection Agency (NEPA),
(HJ/T2.1-2. 3-93); (HJIT2. 4-95 Acoustic Environment); (HJ/T19-1997 Non-Pollution Ecology
Impacts);
The World Bank Operational Manual: OP/BPIGP4.01: Environmental Assessment.
4. The Scope and Criteria for EIA are presented as below:
(I) Assessment Scope
The assessment of social environment covers within 200 m on either side of the proposed highway,
with certain extension in sensitive areas. The ecological environment covers within 300 m on either side,
the surface water environment within 1000 m downstream of bridge. And ambient noise and air are within
200m on either side.
(2) The following standards are applied as the criteria for the EIA:
* For environmental impact assessment of acoustics, Environmental Noise Standards in Urban
Areas GB3096-93 is adopted. For schools and hospitals on the main road, Class-one is adopted; for



villages and residential areas Class-four.
* For the EIA of ambient air, class-two standards in GB 3095-1996 are adopted. For emission of
air pollutants, Class-two Standards in GB116290-1996 are adopted;
* For water environment, Class-three standards are adopted in Environmental Quality Standards
for Surface Water GHZB 1-1999.
*   For emission of domestic sewage, Class-three Sewage Emission Standards GB8978-1996 are
adopted.
5. Class of Assessment
(I)Laoyemiao-Jining Highway: The total length of the alignment is 91.28 km. Considering the
project features and the pertinent environmental condition, the class of assessment has been identified as
Category A. Therefore, the project need to made EIA and EAP.
(2) HNIP Roads: All projects are no new road construction and no land acquisition under this
program, along the proposed alignment, no natural and cultural protected sites are observed. While several
environmentally sensitive sites such as school and hospitals are located along the alignments,
environimental impacts at those sites temporaiv during the construction period. And . their environmental
conditions (noise, dust. etc.) are expected to be improved after the completion of this  program,
Therefore, all five projects under this program are classes as Categorv 1. which needs Initial Environment
Examination (lEE) and EAP.
6. Based on the project features and construction cycle and prediction of traffic volume, the EIA
prediction phases are determined as follows:
(I) For Laoyemiao-Jining Highway
Highway construction phase (2002-2004)
Initial Stage of operation (2005)
Short-tern of operation phase (2005-2010)
Mid-terrn of operation (2015)
Long-term of operation (2025)
(2) For HNIP roads
All of the 5 components are schieduled to be commenced in 2002, and completed and put into
operation before 2004, i.e. a construction period of 2-3 years

C. BASELINE ENVIRONMENTAL DESCRIPTION
I. Environment Survey of Laoyemiao-Jining Highway
9 Terrain
The projected alignment is situated on the Chahaer lava bench land on the south edge of
Inner Mongolian Plateau. It is obvious that the exposure of basalt is resulted from north-east and
east-west faulty belt. The alignment takes right angle to the belt. Basalt is underlain by purplish
red lam and gravel layers. There are many small structural basins between the bench lands with
some being lakes. Topographically, the section between Laoyemiao to Yushuwang is of loess hilly
area underlain by stone bind and conglomerate with severe wind erosion. Section between
Yushuwang to Taigou is typical lava bench land.
10. Seismic activity
The seismic intensity along the project areas is between VI and VI degree.
I1. Climate
The project area belongs to temperate continental monsoon climate zone with plentiful
sunshine. It is dry and windy. It rains seldom. The mean annual precipitation is 365-404 mm.
The rainfall is focused mainly in July through September. The average evaporation is above 1400
mm. Sandstorms occur frequently in April. The annual windy days are averaged to be 30 days.
The average wind speed is 3.4-3.6 m/s. N-W wind prevails here. There are great temperature
differences in various seasons with an average annual temperature being between 3.6-4.8°C. The
lowest temperature is -33.8°C and the highest temperature being 35.7 C. The deepest snow
deposit is 30 cm. The thickest frozen depth is about 1.9 m.
12. River Regime
The rivers the alignment crosses are all seasonal with no water in dry seasons, but floods
occur very often in rainy seasons. The major rivers in the study area are the Bawang River, the
Toutao River, the Niuming River and the Yinzi River. Both Baowang River and Toudao River
flow into the Huangqi lake; the Ymnzi river flows into the Yongding River.
Baowang River: Rising from Yin mountainous ranges, the river goes east till Hongqi lake. It
is used mainly for irrgation.
Yinzi River:: It rises from the south of Xinghe County. Its mean annual runoff is 13.64
million m3 . It belongs to Yongding river regime. It is used for irrigation.
Huangqi Lake: It is located in Chahaheyouyiqian Banner, 10 km from the planned alignment.
The water area is 8,733 ha. No natural fish occur due to bad water quality. It is used mainly for
tourism.
13. Ecosystem
According to the ecological divisions of Ulanqab League, the area south of Daqing
Mountains falls into table-land ecological unit of farming, husbandry and forests. The area is of
rolling hills with many gullies, hills, basins and plains. The major crops are wheat, potato, beans,
millet and flax etc. The ecological conditions are weak in the study area.
15



14. Soil
The soil groups are mainly calcium soil and gray grassy marshland. There are some other
groups of soil: sandy soil, moisture soil, marshland soil, saline soil, alkaline soil and desert soil.
15. Farming
Farming is the main industry of agriculture including wheat, potato, millet, corn and
Chinese sorghum etc. The wheat average yield per mu is 130 kg, and that of potato is 300 kg.
Cash crops are oil plants, sugar beet, vegetables, tobacco, Chinese medicine herbs and hops and so
on. The multiple cropping index is very low because of the severe natural conditions. In general,
only one crop is obtained in one year.
16. Flora
Figure 34 (page 18 of EIS) is the flora distribution along the alignment. It can be seen that
the vegetation in proposed project area mainly belongs to dry farmland and grassland vegetation.
Wild plants occur mainly in the typical pasture areas among hills. There are 15- 20 species of
plants per square meter. They are needle grasses, prairie sagewort, korshinskpeashrub, etc. On the
western bank of the rivers patchily distributed are splendid achnatherum, sedge, razor grass, and
Chinese small iris and other species that are salinity and alkali resistant. Among hills and on
wastelands wormwood, sand fleabane, and green bristle grass occur there. According to the
description of wild fauna and flora along the area of Jining-Laoyemiao highway, which was made
by the Ulanqab League Forestry Bureau, no wild vegetation is listed in category of protection.
Therefore, there lives no important plants along the alignment.
17. Fauna
In Ulanqab League, there used to be Mongolian gazelle, deer, wolves, foxes, hares, eagles,
owls and chukars, etc. However, owing to the damage of ecological environment, the number and
species of these wild animals are being reduced sharply. Nowadays, the route areas are mainly
farming areas and densely populated area for living and production (see Figure 3-5 of EIS). Based
on the survey report by the Ulanqab League Forestry Bureau, there are a few hares and sand
grouses along the alignment area, which belong to non-protected animals of state, region and
county. In addition, the protected areas for wild fauna and flora of Inner Mongolia are outside of
Ulanqab League ( see Figure 3-6).
18. Soil Erosion
The soil erosion module, along the road area, is between 500 -2000 t/km2 - a, belonging to
light erosion. Wind erosion is attributed to strong wind, too much sand in soil, dry top soil and
sparse vegetation.
19. Natural Protected Areas
Both existing and planning natural protected areas in Inner Mongolia are shown in
Figure3-6. From Figure 3-6, the Laoyemiao-Jining Highway is far away from those protected
areas. Therefore, the construction of the project does not affect these natural protected areas.

20. Socio-economics in Study Areas
The directly impacted areas of the proposed highway are: Xinghe County, Jining City,
Chaharyouyiqian.
Jining, the capital of Ulanqab league, is the center of politics, economy and culture of the
league. It serves as a door of the economic development of Inner Mongolia and a traffic hub to the
northwest as well. The economic situation in 1998 of Jining City, Xinghe County, Chahaeryouqian
Banner is in Table C-1.

21. Existing Traffic Transportation
(1). Highway
The projected alignment is the most important trunk route in the middle-western Inner
Mongolia from west to east. It intersects the planned Erlianhot-Hekou National Trunk Highway at
Jining forming cross-type highway framework. In addition, it connects other provincial and
country roads like S304 and S305. All these roads plus the country roads together have formed a
smooth transport network.
(2). Rail
The existing railways here are: Beijing-Baotou rail, Jining -Erlian rail and Jining-Tongliao
rail. Besides, there are four branch lines and private lines.

S304 (provincial Road)                           1770
22. Highway Safety
There are some elements that cause traffic accidents such as higher driving speeds, snow on
road pavement in winter, large longitudinal slope and smaller radius of horizontal curve. For
exanple, in the section (K294-K294+300) of the existing national highway of 110, although there
are 35004200 vehicles per day and average driving speed is 60 km/h, 21 traffic accidents (die: 12
persons; injure: 15 persons) happened between Jan. 2000 and Sept. 2001. Some measures for
highway safety will be taken to decrease occurrence of traffic accidents (See Para XX). The aim of
controlling road accidents is listed in Table C-3

23. Ethnic Minority
The study area is inhabited by many nationalities including Han, Mongolians, Hui, Man,
Koreans, Dawo, Zhuang, Tibetans and Tujia. The Han nationality along the highway accounts for
94.1-97.8%, the Mongolians for 1.9-3.4, and other nationality is less than 3.0%.
24. Cultural Relics
According to the survey report on cultural relics along the proposed alignment areas, which
was conducted by the Inner Mongolia Institute of Cultural Relics and Archaeology, there are no
important cultural relics and cemeteries along the Laoyemiao-Jining Highway construction area.
25. Acoustics
Eight villages were chosen to measure existing noise levels. and measured results of sound
environmental quality along the planned route are as follows:
(I) In the rural areas, the noise levels in the daytime Leq=42.4 to 56.0 dB, Leq=34.4 to
49.5dB at night, which meets Class-four standard in GB3096-93 (Environmental Noise Standards
in Urban Areas)
(2) At sensitive spot of school (Dagong elementary school) Leq=45.5dB in the daytime,
Leq=37.7 at night, which meets Class-one standard in GB3095-93.
(3) The noise level on both sides of existing highway can meets Class-four standard in the
daytime and also meets Class-four standard at 50 meters from the road at night
It can be concluded that the sound environmental quality along the proposed route is fairly
good. The residents and villagers enjoy a quiet environment.
26. Ambient Air
Two monitoring spots are identified along the alignment to monitor concentrations CO,
NOx and TSP in air. The results show that the concentrations of pollutants are all below Class-two
Standards in GB3095-1996. So it has great acceptance capacity. The local air quality is fairly
good.
27. Water
The Bawang River is recommended as water resource to be protected by IUCN. The
Bawang River, The Tudao River and the Niuming River flow into the Huangqi Lake, which is
about 10 km away from the alignment (See Fig.3-1 of EIS). This lake is regarded as an important
source of water for surrounding areas.
The Bawang river and the Yinzi River are chosen as the monitoring water bodies.
Monitoring results show that the existing water quality of the Yinzi River meets Class-one
19



standard in GHZBI-1999, and the water quality of the Bawang River can reach Class-three
standard of national standard for surface water quality(GHZB1-1999). Therefore, the existing
water quality along the route is fairly good, meeting the water quality standards of Class-three
claimed by Inner Mongolia Environmental Protection Bureau.
11. Environmnenial Survey fi)- HNIP Roads
28. Terrain
The geomorphic landforn of Ulanqab League present in varieties of types, mainly
mountainous areas, hilly areas and plains, mostly distributing in belt shapes stretchinig from east to
west or from northeast to southwest, reflecting the tectonic sliapes and signs and presenting the
overall framework of the geomorphic structure.
29. Climate
Being in the middle temperate zone, Ullanqab League is under the influence of continental
monsoon climate. Its yearly rainfall is genierally between 150mm  and 400mm. mostly
concentrated in July and August, the rainfall of these two moniths accounting for 51 -58% of all
the year's rainfall. The yearly average temperature is 0"C-7'C. Due to the area location in the
west wind belt of the middle latitude, all the year round the winds are mostly from NW. The
yearly average wind speed is between 2.2-5m..Js. Winds in the north part are strong, gradually
weaker from N to S. The all year air humidity is between 45-60%.
30. Water Regime
There are no surface water along the highway, only a few canals rushed by flood, no water
in them.
31. Ecology
There are varieties of soil types along the highways, the project areas are mainly distributed
with five soil types of chestnut soil, marshy-grassland soil, windblown- sand soil, badius soil and
saline-alkali soil. The organic matters in soil are rathier low. which is disadvantageous to the
growth of plants.
Farmiand is mainly distributed oni both sides of the highways.
The crops are vegetable, wheat, nake oat. potatoes. grain and oil plants.
The project areas along the route are in poor natural conditions with a bad ecological
environment such as strong winds, little precipitation, serious wind erosion, land desertification
and drought.
There are no natural preservation areas of state and province level and important species
habitats within 5Okm along the route, which was investigated in the field by Inner Mongolia
Environmental Sciences Institute in September and October 2001. There is no protected fauna and
flora. And there are no important habitats of wild animals.
By crosschecking internationally recognized documents: "A Biodiversity Review of China"
by WWF, and "A Directory of Asian Wetlands" by IUCN, and investigating in the field. no
important natiral habitats are involved in this highway network improvement project.
20



32. Natural Disasters
T he main nature disasters are drought, sand blow-n by wind, flood and hail, frost, and insects,
etc.. of which, drough1t and sand blown by wind occur frequently, and are harmful heavily. The
frequency of drought is twice every three years in autumn, once every three years in summer. once
every two years in sprino
33. Social Environiment
Inner Mongolia Autonoinous Region was set up in 1947. which was authorized to be a
minority nationality autollolmlous region due to Mongolia being the majority in local population.
The project areas are located in Ulanqab LeagLue in central part of Inner Mongolia.

D. POTENIAL ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACTS AND
MITIGATION MEASURES
I. Laoyemiao-Jining Highway
Major potential impacts and their mitigation measures regarding Laoyemiao-Jingng
Highway are summarized below and incorporated in the Environmental Action Plan (EAP) of the
project. The EAP stipulate how the environmental impacts identified in the EIA will be dealt with
in the design, construction and operation phases. Institutional arrangements have been made for
the implementation of the EAP in the three distinct phases. The key elements of the EAP for
Laoyemiao-Jinng Highway are summarized in Annexl -.
IN DEIGN PHASE
36. Alternative Alignment
One from the three alternatives was chosen as the recommended scheme.
The comparison of the highway to be or not to be constructed shows that new project
construction has more superiority of the project to local economy and reduction of traffic
accidents.
37. Social Disruption
78 passes (8 per 10 kin), 2 interchange and 9 grade separators will be constructed to
facilitate the crossings of the expressway by local people, animals and vehicles.
38. Soil Erosion
(1) Water Erosion
In design of the alignment, sites for building materials borrow and waste will be chosen
properly in the light of soil conservation and environment protection.
The earth/ stone works for the construction is 6,517,350 m3, the construction will utilize
material excavated from cutting with the road-right-of-way for embankment fills of longitudinal
balance. To prevent soil erosion and collapse, retaining wall & drainage works will be designed.
There are some weak poor geology on the project, short walls will be constructed to protect
the slope.
(2) Wind Erosion
Wind erosion will occur mainly at borrow sites in spring. So, borrow area will be located at
centralized sites, meanwhile, temporary land will be cleared up for rehabilitation on the
completion of the project.
39. Noise
There are I school and 7 villages in the study section along the alignment of main road.
23



Based on the EIA and EAP, a combination of measures such as resettlement and afforestation will
be undertaken to mitigate the medium and long-term noise problems. Before the operation of the
highway, 10 houses will be relocated and approximately 5000 m2 forest strips will be planted at
three sensitive locations.
The villages exceeding the standards at night in 2025 are listed in Table D-1. The noise
levels predicted at other I school and 4 villages do not exceed the standards.

( About 10 houses need to be removed due
to noise pollution
* The noise levels predicted at Bayintala at night in 2020 do not exceed the standard and the level in 2025 will
exceed only one dB. So, there is no need taking preventive measure.
40. Air Pollution
For Laoyemiao-Jining Highway, in 2005, 2010, 2015 and 2025, at the cross sections
predicted, neither NOx nor CO concentrations will exceed the assessment criteria for the
concentration caused by the increased traffic.
41. Water Pollution
There will be two service centers in the section of Laoyemiao-Jining Highway. Sewage
treatment facilities will be set up at the service centers. The sewage will not be discharged unless
is disposed of properly. For it, treatment procedures with septic tank are suggested.
42. Culture Relics
Following the relevant regulations in China, an archaeological survey was carried out by
IMICRA. Based on the survey report on cultural relics along the proposed alignment areas, there
are no important cultural relics and cemeteries along the alignment. Therefore, the construction of
the proposed highway will not involve issues of damage to the relics
43. Land use
By survey, the proposed highway construction will occupy all land of 7419 mu, including
2856.03 mu waste land, 2465.56 mu paddy field, 1329.38 mu non-irrigated farnland, 323.24 mu
woody land and 307.83 mu grassland. In design of the alignment, sites for building materials
25



borrow and water will be chosen properly in the light of soil conservation and environmental
protection. In order to reduce the impacts to a minimum, the land for temporary use like mixing
sites, borrow sites or construction access roads will be rehabilitated for farming. At the same time,
the following engineering and management measures are proposed to take:
*   The alignment will avoid high-yield farmland as possible by using wasteland or dry
land.
*    "Shrinkage" slopes will be used in section of high-yield farmland by means of
retaining walls to protect subgrade to reduce land use.
*   Sites for materials storage and mixing use will be located within the range of land
acquired.
*   Borrow will be conducted centrally for embankment fills.
44. Landscape
On either side of the proposed project there are mainly bad farmland, waste hills and valleys
with no beautiful scenery. There is some apparent impact on local scenery from cutting and
building in construction phase. However, on completion of the project, due to some vegetation
measures to be taken, a new modem highway with beautiful landscape will appear against the
monotonous deserted pasture.
45. Greening
The greening will be designed section by section depending on various requirements like
subgrade type, environment, highway view and induction of visual line, etc.
In addition to subgrade protection and water/soil conservancy, highway landscape and
environment factors such as noise reduction and air pollution will also be taken into account
greening design. Greening design will be incorporated with the construction of local afforestation.
In case of embankment slopes and cut hillsides, engineering measures will be combined
with plant protection. When the cut slope is higher than 8 m, the slope will be protected by using
mortar schist or macadan at the toe. The surface will be protected by means of frames. In the
middle drought-enduring and sand-resist plants will be used.
The median dividers will be planted with drought-resist, wind resist species.
The greening of interchanges will be characterized with local features including species of
plants and patterns. In addition to plane design, vertical design also will be integrated to form all
sided greening.
The greening at service centers will be in harmony with the planning and architecture herein.
Lawns, flower-bearing plants are suitable.
46. Vegetation
The only way to prevent desertification due to the project construction is to compensate for
and/or restore surface vegetation. Planting trees and grasses can protect subgrade, prevent soil
erosion and beautify the view. Trees and grasses will be planted for this purpose. As soon as the
project is completed, the land for temporary use will be cleared for restoration of vegetation or
reclamation where there are irrigation facilities. Where there are no irrigation facilities, grasses
will be planted in straw squares to prevent top-soil from desertification.
26



47. Irrigation
The proposed alignment passes through the Bawang River, the Niuming River and lots of
gullies. To ensure smooth flow of irrigation channels as well runoff, enough culverts have been
designed. There are 2.01 culverts per km, which are sufficient for the area where the annual
rainfall is less than 400 mm.
IN CONSTRUCTION PHASE
48. Noise
In order to reduce the time to expose to loud noise, the workers operate noise producing
machines on shift basis. High-noise producing machinery will not be allowed to operate
(22:00-6:00) at sections in close vicinity of residential areas such as Dajing Village,
Gaomiaozi village and Bashixiang village.
Machinery operators and construction workers will be protected with provisions like
earplugs and helmets.
Quarries, mixing sites, and asphalt mixers will be located more than 100 m from
sensitive places.
The major haulage routes will be chosen as far as possible from villages and schools and
other sensitive locations.
49. Air Pollution
The material storage sites and earth and limestone mixing sites will be located in open areas
200 m from residential areas or schools. Construction material storage sites, assess roads and road
section near village or schools will be sprayed with water regularly.
To control fugitive dust, the construction sites and major hauling roads will be sprayed
regularly (two times a day, in the morning and afternoon) to prevent dust.
Asphalt mixing sites will be selected properly and will be located at least 500 m from
residential areas on the down wind direction of the wind directions. Besides, in the asphalt
cooking process, open or semi-enclosure techniques will be allowed absolutely.
50. Ecosystem
(1). Vegetation protection
Protect trees within right-of-way, protection forests for irrigation channels in particular;
Not cut trees within the temporary land if possible. Protection forests of soil conservancy
and irrigation channels are not allowed to cut;
Trees beyond right-of-way are not allowed to cut, grass land and bushes will be protected
by strengthening management.
(2). Reduce areas of borrow and spoil sites
The total area for borrow and spoil sites is about 1,586 mu, mostly in hilly areas having no
impacts on farmland, natural vegetation or residential areas. To reduce desertification, elevation of
embankment will be lowered where appropriate so that the area for borrow and spoil sites can be
reduced.
(3). Rehabilitation of borrow and spoil sites
In construction, the activities of selection of borrow and spoil sites will be incorporated with
local agriculture development and general plan under consultation with the local authorities. To
27



sum up, these sites will be rehabilitated as soon as possible.
(4). Temporary land
During construction period it is advisable to locate the land for temporary use within the
highway right-of-way such as interchanges, service centers and toll stations. The construction
campuses and other sites will be rented in existing places. All the damaged vegetation and
exposed soil resulting from the construction will be rehabilitated as soon as the project is finished.
51. Water Pollution
To mitigate effect of highway construction on water bodies such as the Bawang River, the
Yinzi River, the following measures will be taken.
(l) To reduce bridge construction pollution, some up-to-date techniques will be adopted
such as sinking drum methods and cofferdam method, which are suitable for the particular
conditions of these rivers in the study area.
(2) Wastewater containing oil will not be allowed to discharge into rivers before treated in a
proper way.
(3)The storage sites of building materials of asphalt, oil and chemicals should be far away
from riverbanks and muffled.
(4)The sewage of construction campus (about 20 m3 a day) which is one of the pollution
sources will be treated centrally. Feces, when composted, will be used as manure.
52. Flooding
To protect irrigation channels and prevent soil erosion, the construction/reconstruction
work of irrigation channels will be done in dry and slack seasons.
Mud and sand coming from construction of large and middle-sized bridges are not allowed
to dump into river courses, floodplains or banks of channels.
When construction access roads cause disturbances to irrigation channels, temporary
bridges and culverts will be built to guarantee smooth runoff.
53. Resettlement
Although the alignment has avoided the urban areas of Jining and Xinghe Town sites and
other towns and villages, an area of 3315 m2 (about 166 rooms) will be demolished. The local
policy regarding housing demolition and resettlement will be carried out strictly. The
compensation funding will be granted to those themselves whose houses are demolished without
using for other purposes.
Resettlement will be conducted under the management of the local governments in such a
way to occupy as less farmland as possible. The new houses will be built in the areas where the
noise levels at night are less than 50 dB.
Resettlement will be implemented prior to commencement of the project itself. The new
houses will be improved to some extent compared to the current ones. Support will be given to
those who have difficulties in building new houses.
Minority nationalities will be concerned in resettlement their customs and religion will be
respected.
54. Protection of Cultural Relics
28



Construction works will be stopped immediately if any cultural relics are discovered as a
result of road construction or excavation activities. The local cultural relics authorities will be
informed immediately. Excavation will be resumed unless the authorities approve of it.
IN OPERATION PHASE
55. Local Plan
The prediction of traffic noise reveals that in long-term of operation (2025) the noise
levels with 150 m of the road are below class-four of GB3096-93 (Standard levels on both sides
of the highway. Therefore, no new residential houses will be built within 100 m of the highway
and other environmentally sensitive buildings such as schools and hospitals within 150m.
The masses and local governments along the road will be mobilized to plant trees on fallow
land and between road and villages to protect the environment.
56. Noise
According to the noise levels of sensitive locations in the study area during operation phase,
the noise impacts are assessed as follows:
(1) The distance from the Dagong School to the proposed highway is 140m. The section
of the road near the school is moat configuration. In addition, there is a hill between the school
and the propose road. This hill has a function of natural sound barrier and greatly reduces the
impact of traffic noise, caused by the highway on the school. The noise levels at Dagong
School in the daytime will be less than 55 dB (Class-one Standard.) and the levels at the school
at nighttime will be less than 45dB(Class-one Standard).
(2) In the daytime, the noise levels at 7 village residential areas will not exceed 70dB
(Class-four standard of environmental noise of urban area).
(3) At the nighttime, the traffic noise has some impacts on Bashixiang, Dajing and
Gaomiaozi villages. Therefore, mitigation measures to be taken at both villages are listed in Table
D-2 ( Para.37).
After three villages will be achieved above mitigation measures (Table D-2), The noise
levels can basically be in compliance with Class-four standards of GB3096-93. (day :70 dB,
night: 55dB)
57. Vehicular Management
(I) Better vehicle maintenance/management will be enhanced to keep vehicles in good
conditions. Vehicle noise and emission inspection will be strengthened. If a vehicle does not
comply with the noise and /or emission standard, the vehicle will not be allowed to pass unless the
problem is rectified. Periodical and random exhausted gas emissions inspection will be taken.
(2) Public awareness and education will be promoted to familiarize people with the problem
of air pollution and noise from vehicles and with related regulations.
58. Risk of spills of hazardous goods
Domestic sewage at 2 service centers plus tolling stations will be treated by using septic
tanks and after treated used as manure for farming. Otherwise it can not be discharged into river
29



bodies.
Toll stations can also take responsibilities of traffic control to stop vehicles with spills and
overload running on the road.
The administrative departments will be informed of vehicles hauling hazardous materials
and they can not run on the road unless get permits. Such vehicles will be provided with obvious
markings and can not stop wherever they want.
In case of accidental spill of hazardous materials, the relevant departments will be
immediately informed of to take prompt actions based on the emergency plan.
59. Highway Safety
(I) Impacts during construction phase
It has impacts on the construction workers and the masses. As to the construction workers,
they are likely to be injured in bridge construction. In inviting tenderers in construction bridges
and big cut sections in heaving rolling areas, the tenderers will be strictly selected. Only the
qualified in all aspects can undertake the construction. Strict regulations will be followed to ensure
the safety of the workers, and it will be written in the contract.
Wardens will posted at crossing, school sections and residential area to ensure that they are
safe.
The working time must be in schedule at some blasting sections. At blasting, no vehicles and
pedestrians are allowed to cross. The neighboring villages can be subsided for their temporarily
leaving at blasting.
No crossing of pedestrians is allowed when building up bridges.
(2) Impact during operation phase
The existing Laoyemiao-Jining Highway is one section of National Road 110 in Inner
Mongolia The road class is low with steep grade. It has been streetlized at many sections leading
to frequent traffic accidents. On completion of the road, however, the traffic accidents will
decrease to a grade degree because of better road conditions and detour of the densely peopled
towns and villages. Hence the financial losses will decrease accordingly.
H1 Potential Impact and Mitigation for HNIP Road Project
An EAP has been made out for HNIP Road project. All the available measures in the main route
of Laoyemiao-Jining Highway are adoptable HNIP Road Project, such as scenery protection, traffic
safety and ecological protection etc. All the following are some specific measures for HNIP Road. The
key elements of the EAP for HNIP Road summarized in Annex 1-2.
. IN DESIGN PHASE
60. The factors shotild be considered in design phase as following:
(1) If the project has earth borrowing and discarding. it is necessary to ascertain the source sites of
earth, disposal sites of wastes and earth. Farmland can not be used, and the project can not cause
adverse effects on rivers, ditches and reservoirs. It is not allowed to destroy riverbeds and scenery spots
during sand dredging and stone mining.
(2) If trenching system of road sides have to be occupied by the project, subgrade and
30



trencihing svstem must be re-designed. and it is also required to avoid dischargc of oily sewage to
farmland and drinking water.
(3) Project afforestation should be included in project genieral planniing, for which necessary
funds be places to guarantee the timely implementation after the project completion. T'he most
important places to be afforestated are schools. sections of road near residential areas, slopes where the
vegetation are destroyed, temporary land use. borrow pit and waste area etc.
(4) If the newly-designed slopes are big, necessary technical measures must be taken to stabilize
the slopes to prevent water erosion and add to the beauty of the highway. Upon completion of the
project, it is required to construct protection slope, shoulder. ditches and other places. which have been
damaged by tile constiuction. All these places shall be recovered with vegetation to prevent water
erosion.
(5) T'his project belongs to road reliabilitation and improvement project. Due to historical reasons,
there are a lot of schools and villages, during project design and construction, it is important to avoid or
reduce the environmiental impacts on these places during constructioni. In the stage of design. it is
required to choose the sites which are possibly far awvay from ihese places for material stacking.
concrete and asphalt mixing etc. Materials transportation shall be equipped with dust-proof facilities
and try to detour to avoid pollution. These facilities include water sprayer, low-noise equipment etc.
Equipnment of high noise shall be adequately treated to avoid noise pollution such as by using sound
alTesters.
(6) According to the result of project environmental impact assessment, necessary preventive
measures against noise are required during project design.
IN CONSTRUCTION PHASE
61. Social Environments
In the constructionl of bridges and culverts, effete on farning irrigation and flood releasing
should be reduced to the utm1ost. Dumps and wastes are strictly inhibited to discard into the water
body.
Present irrigating or draining systems cut across or damaged ought to be rebuilt or reformed
in proper way through sufficient consultation with local persons concerned.
During construction period Toward traffic hold ups or jams. problems should be settled by:
I) Strengthening traffic management at traffic conflict spots with specific persons to
maintain traffic order.
2) Before constructioii, for the least blocking traffic plans should be made to lessen effects
onl traffic.
3) Encouraging contractors taking night material conveyinlg or preparing materials in slack
seasons.
In densely populated areas. construction should be arranged as short as possible so as to
reduce effects on inhabitants.
62. Vegetation
The construction management shall be strengthened during this period to avoid damaging
the vegetation.
31



For the damaged areas such as the temporarily occupied land and makeshift shortcuts, the
restoration of land and recoverv of vegetation shall be conducted after the completion of work..
63. Soil Erosion
The refuse, earth and stones discarded during the construction shall be filled into the pits
nearby and buried up. It is not allowed to discard them in the open at will. The earth and stones
should not be heaped up on the upper sloping sides of the cutting or in the filled gullies or valleys
so as to avoid severe water and soil loss in case of heavy rains.
Measures for water and soil conservation on both sides of the highxAav:
(I) Grass planting on side slopes of the roadbed
(2) Protective works for the roadbed
(3) Measures for protection of cuttings
(4) In order to prevent the built-up water on the pavement from carrying away the soil from
the roadbed and the primary surface of it, the drainage system shall be built up for the pavement
and the roadbed. The drainage ditches should be designed longer so that no water and soil loss
would be increased at local place due to the surface soil washout by the drained water.
64. Noise
There are some schools, clinics and villages along the existing road. The innovation of
highways will widen and level the previous roadbed. Some large machinery are not necessarily
used, except the noise sources from spreader, roller and some other traffics. In construction phase,
the work and lift (especially sleeping at night) near the road are influenced as the instant noise
values can exceed the criteria (70 dB(A) in davtine; 55 dB(A) at night). The construction and its
noise will impact on schools (noise values exceed 60 dB(A) for the roadside classrooms). The
lucky thing is there are no pupil living in schools, and no negative impact on them. The
completion of road, with its improvement of higher transport, noise will be lower.
In construction phase, the noise decrease can be realized by controlling of working time, tilat
is, construction work can not be done between 2:00 at night to 6:00 of the next morning.
65. Air Pollution
Lime-earth mixing fields and asphalt -mixing fhelds should be located in downwinid places
200in beyond the sensitive areas.
Vehicles transporting building materials should be covered so that spills will be made as less
as possible.
On road for transporting building materials and in construction sites, proper watering
measures should be taken.
When vehicles conveyinig building materials pass throuigh densely inhabited areas or
sensitive spots, running speed should be redtuced to lessen the influence of dust raising, moreover,
in sensitive areas vehicles passing through, rate- limiting signs should be set up.
IN OPERATION PHASE
32



66. Soil and Vegetation
After the highway is put into service, the use of the reclaimed land shall be taken into
consideration. The reclaimed land shall be first put for agricultural use and then for forest and
livestock. Generally, pasture grass shall be planted initially and, after the land capability is raised,
it can be used as farmland.
67. Water and Soil Conservancy
During thie service stage of the highway. the works or measures, which have been taken,
should be maintained. In sections where soil erosion is caused by build-up of water on the
pavement or by improper preventive measures, remedial actions shall be taken immediately. And
also timely watering, fertilization and weed eliminating to ensure the proper growthi of the plants
shall carefully tend the biological mcasures. The under grown plants shiall be reseeded in time and
the causes shall be found out.
68. Noise
There are 9 noise sensitive points totally within a distance of 200 m at each side of the five
highways of HNIP (8 schools and I clinic). 1Thev are all located within the distance of 80-150 m
from the highways. Forecast values for these 9 sensitive points show that in operation phase 7
points will exceed the standards Class I in Noise Standards at Urban Areas (GB30'96-93). But
the forecast values also show that exceeding values for these 7 points are not big due to small
traffic volume. The maximum exceeding value is 5.7 dB(A). These 7 points are specified as
followilng:
one school in the highway Zlhuozishan-Liangchen (80m away from the highway), two
schools in the highway Kebuer-Baiyinchagan (80m and lOOm respectively), 3 schools in the
highway Tumuertan-Sliangdu (80m. lOOm and 120m). and one clinic (80m).
So in these 7 sensitive points. mitigation measures are needed such as increasing the height of
fences of scliools and clinics and planting trees to avoid the influence of traffic noise.
The sensitive sites where mitigation measures will be taken are summarized in Table D-3.

69. Air Pollution
In operation period (in 2010, 2015 and 2020), exihaust gas is the predicted not to impact the
atmosphere obviously. Under usual weather conditions, it will not pollute the sensitive poinits
along the highways.
70. Afforestation
The areas the highwvay goes througIl the areas characterized with dry climate, big winds and
serious sand attack. great cliange in soil and vegetation and especially severe soil erosion in some
sections. Therefore the greening of this section of the highiway can be carried out in several sectors
according to different kiinds and functions of the planting.
Where the soil erosion and desert- fiction by wvind are more serious. so the wind-, sand- and
aridity-resistant elms, populous simonies. Xinjiang poplars. caravan microphylla etc. shall be
selected as tihe planting trees for the both sides of the route.
To green the relatively smooth terrain. normally tree rows of arbors. such as poplar pekinica,
Xinjiang poplars, weeping willows, dry land willows, Chiinese taniarisks, etc. shiall be planted
outside the side ditches of the roadbed.
For the afforestation in the area of hills and gullies, different measures should be taken for
the various surface features.
This section of hiighway shall be mainly made green with Chinese pines, larches. Chinese
junipers, Xinjiang poplars. poplar pekinica. Hebei poplars, sea-buckthoTn bushes. etc.
71. Safet,
At some sections, accidents possibly occur near villages and towns as traffic speed can
increase on the improved roads. Signs can be posted and publicizing can be commonly used for
the reduction of accidents.
72. Environmental cost estimate

E. ALTERNATIVES
73. The proposed highway from Laoyemiao to Jining has three comparison schemes, e.g. Scheme
I, II and III .See Figure E-l.
Scheme I is to construct a new expressway near the existing Class 11 highway, and most of
the existing Class 11 highway will be used as relief road. The total length in Scheme I is 91.28 km
Scheme 11 and Scheme I are quite the same in terms of location of the route, the route
alignment, control points and standards, except that the construction periods of the two schemes
are different. In Scheme 1, the full-width expressway will be completed at one time; in Scheme 11,
the highway will be constructed by width and by stage. Phase I of Scheme 11 is to constructed a
new half width highway near the existing Class 11 highway, and the existing Class II highway will
be used as another half . Phase 2 of Scheme 11 will is to build another half-width road, with the
existing road as relief road. The total length of Scheme II is also 91.28 km.
In Scheme 111, both sides of the existing highway will be expanded to built a Class I
highway with four lanes. In the Scheme 111, the total length is 91.559 km
74. Comparison between Build-scheme and No-build scheme (zero Scheme)
There is an existing highway between Laoyemiao to Jining, namely National Road 110.
However, the class of existing highway is two leading to frequent traffic accidents due to low
technical standards, more heavy truck on the road and other unfavorable conditions. Meanwhile,
the existing highway does not meet the need to implement the state's main framework of National
Trunk Highway System (NTHS). With the increase of traffic volume in the future, low traffic
capacity of the existing highway is not in conformity with the requirement for carrying out the
State Strategy of Massive Development of the West. As to noise and vehicle exhausted gases (CO,
NO2) in the operation phase, zero alternative would be worse than the proposal alternative.
75. Comparison of Environmental Elements
(1) Ecological Environment
*    Soil erosion
Because the Scheme I and the Scheme II are the exactly same route alignment, and the scheme
I and Scheme III are near to each other, the natural environment, topographical and earth work
amount are basically the same. So, there is no obvious difference between soil erosion amount
caused by scheme I and that by scheme 111.
* Land Acquisition
Scheme I will occupy 8,985.8 mu of land. Scheme III will occupy 4118.1 mu of land. Impact
of land use of scheme III is less than that of scheme 1.
*    Removed Buildings
The demolition area of Scheme I is 3315 m2. The removed area of scheme III is 7230 m3.
Removed area of scheme III is more than that scheme I. In addition, survey shows that another 13
houses will be removed by scheme III.
(2) Noise

Scheme 1: In the year of 2025 in operation phase, the noise level in 3 villages will exceed the
standard (at night); However, Scheme III: 6 villages will exceed the standard. So, from the angle
of noise impact, Scheme I is superior to Scheme 111.
(3) Water
There is no great difference of impact on water because of the basically same traffic
volume and the same number of management and service centers.
(4) Social development
There is no great difference of impact on social development because of the basically same
traffic volume and the same number of grade separations.
(5) Ambient air
There is no great difference of impacts on the air because of the same traffic volume and
meteorological conditions.
(6) Safety
Scheme I is superior to scheme III for the following reason: Scheme III will upgrade existing
highway to become a Class I highway with four lanes. The indicators of the existing highway's
alignment are low; Some parts have 4 places with small radius, and have big longitudinal slopes;
The technical standards of part of the sections do not comply with the requirements for Class I
highways. the low subgrade cannot be closed, and the mixed traffic cannot be solved with bad
safety conditions;
So, from the viewpoint of comprehensive environmental impact, scheme I is superior to
scheme III.
76. Micro level Scheme alternatives
Four micro level alternatives at the sections of Xinghe, Jiabazi, Niuming village and xiao
nao were analyzed during the designing of actual alignment from the viewpoints of environmental
protection. The results of the environmental comparisons are as followed.
37



(1) Schemes for section in Xinghe County
The existing road is situated in the south of the County, 2 km far from the County. The proposed
highway can be either located between the existing road and the County (Scheme B) or situated in
the south part of the existing road (Scheme A) (see Figure E-2a). For environmental
considerations, Scheme B is close to the Xinghe County so as to affect the future development of
the County in land. Meantime, it is so close to the resident area as to bring both noise and exhaust
impacts to the resident by vehicles. Also, Scheme B would occupy much farmland. For Scheme A,
however, it keeps away from the resident area avoiding the impact on the resident by noise and
exhaust as well as is beneficial to the development of the County. Furthermore, Scheme A mainly
would occupy wasteland. From the viewpoint of environmental protection, Scheme A would be
adopted.

(2) Schemes for section in Jiabazi (K320)
Jiabazi section is across hills which take the shape of "V" in terrain and the existing road is
located at the bottom of the "V". Three Schemes: A, B and C, can be used in this section as shown
in Figure E-2b. Schemes A and C would require to be situated at the hillside; Although the
alignment is good, in construction, it would be required to explode the hill with deep cut and high
fill, which would lead to serious soil erosion. From standpoints of environmental protection and
decreasing soil erosion, Scheme B would be finalized, i.e. using the existing road locally so as to
diminish the land acquisition. In the meantime, soil erosion would be avoided resulting from the
deep cut and high fill.

(3)  Schemes for section in Xiaonao (K330)
Three Schemes A, B and C, are under consideration for section in Xiaonao (see Figure E-2c). If
Scheme A were used, it would influence the Xiaonao Pond. Drought occurs locally and surface
water is very rare. Therefore, in order to protect the water resources of the Xiaonao Pond, Scheme
A is denied. Scheme C would widen the existing road. Though the amount of works is small, it is
so close to the Village of Jiajia and occupies a lot of irrigated farmland. Consequently, Scheme C
is vetoed too. In order to aviod the impact on the Xiaonao and decrease acquisition of irrigated
farmland, the proposed road would be located at the hillside and near rto the existing road.
Therefore, Scheme B is finalized as recommendation.

(4)   Schemes for section in Niuning Village (K340)
Three Schemes A, B and C, for section under the proposed road close to the Village of Niuming
have been done. Scheme A would use the existing road with less quantity of works and less land
acquisition. However, it would be so close to the Village of Niuming that noise and exhaust by
vehicles would heavily impact on the local resident. For Scheme B, it would be newly built to the
south of the Village of Ertaigou. This Scheme has better alignment with low cost of works.
However, it would occupy more irrigated fannland and cut a large number of trees. As for Scheme
C, it would also be a new road in the south of the Niuming Village with moderate indicators in
alignment and use most of the waste land. The Scheme C has plenty of structures with a long
distance of transportation of principal building materials. For environmental considerations,
however, Scheme C would be recommended.

Build-scheme is superior to no-build scheme in terms of environmental protection.
On the basis of careful and comprehensive comparison in diverse aspects including safety and
micro level alternatives, our EIA statement recommends Scheme I to comply with the
recommended scheme of the report of project feasibility study
F INVESTMENT FOR ENVIRONMENTAL PROJECTION
77. Based on the measures suggested in EIS, the total estimated cost for the project of
Laoyemiao-Jining Highway is 14.4909 million RMB yuan, accounting for 0.815% of the total cost
of the project. For details, see Annex 4.
78. The total EP investment for HNIP Road Project amounts to 10.05 million RMB yuan.
G. ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT AND MONITORING
a. ENVIRONMENTAL MONITORING
I Laoyemiao-Jining Highway
79. During the construction and operation phases of Inner Mongolia Highway Project,
environmental monitoring will be carried out to verify the actual impacts on the environment,
identify unexpected environmental problems at an early stage, and adjust environmental protection
measures as appropriate. The Ulanqab League Environmental Monitoring Station will be
responsible for environmental monitoring in construction and operation phases.
80. The major items to be monitored in construction phase will include air quality, noise, and
water quality. These items will be monitored in the operation phase as well. In addition, sewage
discharge at service centers, toll stations and administrative areas will be monitored. The detailed
monitoring plan is presented below.
(1) Air Quality
During the construction phase, TSP will be monitored at lime and earth mixing sites as well
as construction road. It will be monitored once three-months, four times a day.
During the operation phase, TSP and NOx will be monitored four times a year for three
consecutive days each time.
(2) Noise
During the construction phase, noise monitoring will be carried out one a month at eight
sensitive sites such as villages and school, and one day two to three times, i.e. two times of
sampling in day time and night.
During the operation phase, noise will be monitored four times a year, one day each time,
42



i.e. four times of sampling in daytime and night.
(3) Water quality
During the construction and operation phase, water quality will be monitored involving
The Bawang River, the Yinzi river in Laoyemiao-Jining Highway, COD, SS and oil will be
monitored two times a year.
(4) Ecological environment
Borrow pits, quarries, construction camps, temporally used lands, mixing sites, haulage
roads, etc. will be monitored 4 times a year in the construction phase and once a year in
operational stage.
81. An annual monitoring report would be furnished to the World Bank by January 31 of each year
starting in 2002 during the construction phase and each of the first three years following
completion of construction. Fig.F-I is the report system for monitoring.

b. INSTITUTIONAL ARRANGEMENTS
82. During the construction and operation phases, the following institutional arrangement will
undertake responsibilities of environmental protection of Inner Mongolia Highway Project.
The Inner Mongolia Communications Department (IMCD) is responsible for the EP
arrangement. Its responsibilities are to coordinate the EP management between executive
departments and employers; instruct employers to implement the managerial measures. The
divisions are: The EPO under the agency of the PMO under IMCD is responsible for the EP plans
43



and environmental management in the design phase. The PMO is responsible for the
implementation and management of the EAP in construction phase for Laoyemiao-Jining
Highway and the Inner Mongolia Expressway Administrative Bureau (IMEAB) is responsible for
the EAP in the operation phase. The Inner Mongolia Highway Bureau (IMHB) is responsible for
the implementation and management of the EAP in the construction phase and the operation phase
for HNIP Roads.
(a) Design phase: the EP unit of PMO (2 persons)
(b) During the construction phase, the two supervisors from the PMO will be responsible
for the supervision of the implementation of EP measures in EAP and tendering documents.
(c) Upon completion of the project, specialized people will be assigned to take
responsibilities of EP in their areas in areas in Jining city, Xinhe county and other with HNIP
Road.

c. ENVIRONMENTAL TRAINING
83.Training of Personnel
The program is intended to train the administrative personnel, technicians and supervisors
involved in environmental protection so that they can acquire the knowledge of environmental
protection and ensure the fulfillment of the EAP.
According to their responsibilities, the trainees fall into three groups: administrative
personnel, environmental supervisors, and worker staff.
The training is to be carried out both at home and abroad. Those to be trained abroad will
learn the new methods, techniques and management experience from the advanced countries and
to introduce them to all the personnel in charge of environmental protection. Those to be trained at
home include administrative personnel and working staff, with the training seminars sponsored by
the project office, and lectures given by the senior staff from the World Bank, government officials
and experts.
The training of one high-level administrative personnel will cost 90,000 RMB yuan; The
training of two stuff of EPO will cost 180,OOORMB yuan. with 90,000RMB yuan for each; The
training of 15 environmental technical and supervision engineers will cost 150,000RMB yuan,
with 1,000 RMB yuan for each; The cost totals 420,O00RMB yuan.
H. PUBLIC CONSULATION
I. Laoyemiao-Jining Highway
84. In November 1998, after environmental screening and before the TOR for the EA are
finalized, the EA panel from Xian Highway University conducted first time social and public
consultations at Jining City, Xinhe County, Gaomiaozi town and Beiyintal town. 39 individuals
who are interested in the project attended consultation. At consultation meetings, draft TOR of
EIA was published. The TOR has such contents as: I) highway location; 2) possible noise impact;
3) possible impact from separation; 4) possible influence from land taking etc. All the participants
gave out their opinions actively, which shows a positive attitude to the highway construction as
well as a great concern on land taking compensations.
In the end of July 1999, on the basis of the initial draft of the EIA, the EIA term had made the
second public consultation by face-to-face talks with 18 persons interested in the road at
Beryintala town, Gaomiaozi Village and Dagong Primary School. The draft EA report contains the
following: 1) adverse impacts of the highway; 2) EP measures to be taken; 3) public views on our
measures. The individuals all paid great attention to the project construction because they are
closely related to their own interests. .
In August 2001, according to the E1S of the proposed highway, we conducted the third public
45



consultation work. Three public consultation meetings were holed at Caoci'yao village's Cattle
Breeding Association (a local NGO), Badaqing village and Shangsanhaodi village, respectively.
38 persons who are interested in the proposed project attended the meetings. At the consultation
meetings, the panel provided the affected groups with the proposed project's objectives, alignment
and the EA conclusion and pointed out the major potential impacts on environment. Through fully
discussion with the representatives of local NGOs, farmers, individuals, the memorandums of
consultant meetings were obtained.
In addition, 142 of the questionnaires were handed out with 121 collected. Questionnaire
forms were handed out to collect the opinions of masses (see Table H-i).
The Chinese version of the final EIA was publicized at the Wulanchabu Freeway Project Office
during Septeber 6-30,2001. Before it was publicized, an advertisement for EIA information
disclosure was put on the Wulanchabu Daily (a local newspaper) on September 6, 2001 in order to
let affected groups, local NGOs and individuals interested in the project know the public
consultations and information disclosure. At the same time, the advertisement publicized
telephone number for information consultation and address of showing the EIA report, etc.

85. The public consultations show that all the governments, council representatives, individuals
who interested in the proposed road and NGO concerned expressed their wishes that the highway
will be put into use as soon as possible. The investigation indicates that 95% of the individuals
agree on the construction of the highway; 84% of the masses agree on land acquisition and
resettlement; 98% of the individuals consider that the construction of the highway is advantageous
to the local economy development; 90% of the individuals think that the proposed highway is
good for improving their living standards. They all support the project.
The concerns of the public are summarized as follows:
(a) To use as less good farmland as possible and compensate for the farmland used properly.
(b) To arrange resettled household timely and properly according to relevant policy and
regulations to ensure that their living standards not lowed.
(c) 78 passageways, 9 grade separations, 8 large bridges and 30 middle-sized or small
46



bridges will be built, which has already been considered in the design. There are about 8
passageways per 10 km for pedestrians and motor traffic.
According to Mission Aide Memoire (Jan. 10-13, 2002), additional public consultation will be
conducted in February. The consultation will set its target on ordinary residents in each village.
The plan intends to consult addition 500 persons. The results of the consultation will be submitted
to the Bank as an independent report.
The EA documents will be disclosed domestically no later than January 22, 2002.
11 HNIP Road Project
86. On July 24-27, 2001. after environmental screening, the EA group divided into two parts held
public conisultation meetings in Jiniing City. Huade County, Liangcihen County. Zhuozishan
County and Baiyinchagan Cotnty, with 16, 12, 15, 14 and 14 persons respectively. Most of them
are local people. Meanwhile, 500 questionnaires were distributed with 495 collected.
On Sep.26-29, 2001. after draft IEE. the EA group divided into two parts held public
consultaion meetings again in Jining City. Huade County, Liangchen County, Zhuozishan County
and Baiyinchagani County, with 21, 15. 14, 14 and 16 persons respectively. Most of them are also
local people. At meantime, 500 questionnaires were distributed with 499 feedback.
Besides local people, the participations of consultation meetings were from the Council
representatives, local governors and NOGs along the alignment and we also consulted the
following departments: agriculture, forestry, water conservancy and communications about
environmental protection.
1000 questionnaires distributed totally were collected 994. Investigation results can be seen
in table H-2.
In July and August 2001, the EIA team involving 10 persons publicized basic circumstances
of the project along the route with such contents as: 1) highiway location; 2) possible noise impact;
3) possible influence from highway construction etc. The publicizing was carried out by two
methods as door-by-door introduction and material sending. All the participants gave out their
opinions actively, whichi shows a positive attitude to the higilway constructions.
In the end of September 2001, on the basis of the initial draft of the EIA, we had face-to-face
investigations with 58 persons at impacted areas. All the contents publicized and realized contain
the following: 1) adverse impacts of the highway; 2) EP measures to be taken; 3) public views on
our measures. They all paid great attention to the project construction because they are closely
related to their own interests.
An advertisement for EIA informnationi disclosure was put on the Wulanchabu Daily (a local
newspaper) on January 15. 2002 in order to let affected groups, local NGOs and individuals know
the public consultations and informationi disclosure. At the same time, the advertisement
publicized the phone number for information consultation and address of showinig the EIA report.
87. The investigation indicates that 98% of the masses agree on the construction as soon as
possible: 90.2% of the masses expressed the dissatisfaction to the traffic status; almost all of them
think that the proposed higlhway is good for improving their living standards. Tliey all support the
project.
The concerns of the public are summarized as follow:
47



1) To use as less good farmland as possible for temporary land use dturing construction, and
compensate for the farmland used properly.
2) Due to poor vegetation and almost no trees along the alignment in project areas, in this
investigation, local people all requier that due to the poor ecological environment in the project
areas we must protect the ecological environment and improve the quality of the natural
environment, and atTorest along the alignment while construction.
The cost of atTorestation in the local areas is generally 5000 yuariRNllhB kmii. According to the
results of public consultation. the cost will be added up to 8000-10000 yuanRMB/km, which is
modified in atTorestation plan in this report.

I CONCLUSION
I. Laoyemiao-Jining Highway
88. Assessment Results of existing Environment
(1) Acoustic Environment
The noise levels in the rural areas along the route meet Class-four in GB3095-93. The level
at Dagong school meets class-one standard in GB3095-93. The areas along the route are with
fairly good acoustic quality.
(2) Ecological Environment
The ecological environment along the alignment is of undulate bench and river basin plain
types with fanning and husbandry industry. The areas of Shangshanhao along the proposed
highway enjoys good farming condition with other areas being deserts or pastures with weak
ecological environment.
The area belongs to "Protection Forest Areas of Three North" with very poor vegetation
cover of 10-30%.
Existing soil erosion: light water erosion with a module of 500~-2000 t/km2 - a; light wind
erosion.
Crop a year with a yield of 100-200 kg per mu.
No rare plants and animals worthy protecting are hardly found along the route.
(3) Social Surroundings
Agriculture is the leading industry along the route, and is one of the poorest areas
receiving assistance from the country. The average income of farmers is 825 -151 7 yuan.
The areas are inhabited by a number of nationalities. The ration of Han, Mongolian and Hui
is 94.197.8%o  I.9-3.4%andO.2-1.4%.
(4) Ambient Air
The mean hourly and daily concentrations of CO and NO2 are lower than Class-two in
GB3095-1996, and in general, the existing ambient air quality in fairly good.
(5) Water Environment
The water quality of the Yinzi River is of Class-one of surface water and that of the Bawang
River of Class-three. In general, the surface water can reach Class-three of water due to existing
situation of water quality.
89. Potential Impact on Environment and Mitigation Measures
a. OPERATION PHASE
(1) Noise
The traffic noise in operation phase will not have notable impacts on the environment in the
daytime in the study area. The noise levels in the villages along the route are in accordance with
Class-four of GB3096-93 basically. The noise level at the school meets the Class-one of
GB3096-93.
The traffic noise during operation phase will have impacts to some extent on the
49



environment. In short-term operation, Three villages will exceed the standards at night. With the
implementation of the mitigation measures suggested in the report, the traffic noise on the
environment will be reduced to a minimum. This project has minor impacts on acoustic
environment.
(2) Ecological Environment
The occupation of land for the highway construction will have no notable impacts on land
use in general resulting in minor change in biomass. Therefore, the project construction will not
affect the types of ecological environment and its features.
The construction of the proposed project will have no impacts on wild fauna and flora in the
Ulanqab League area.
The land occupied for the project is mostly of wasteland and dry land with low yield
(accounts for 55.87% of the total land occupied.
Greening will be implemented within the right-of-way along the whole alignment to
improve ecological environment in the study area.
The landscape along the route will be beautified along the alignment.
(3) Impact Assessment on Soil Erosion
During construction phase, the earth works and embankment engineering will result in
remarkable hydraulic erosion. Besides, at various borrow sites there will be wind erosion because
of strong winds. However, the soil erosion is local and has short-term, and it can be controlled.
With implementation of embankment protection work, drainage systems and greening works, the
soil erosion resulting from subgrade slope protection can be controlled in an effective way.
Eventually, the soil erosion will be restored to the original levels prior to the construction or the
erosion will be even less the existing one.
(4) Social Environment
The construction is viable because of its good economical benefits and cost/benefit capacity.
The construction of the highway is the necessity for completion of the national highway
networks, the national trunk line configuration and the main highway frame of Inner Mongolia. It
is a very important step for economic transmission to the central and western parts and for
improving infrastructure facilities in Inner Mongolia The proposed project will have significant
social benefits by playing an important role in business, trade, industry, agriculture, husbandry,
transport and tourism. Thus, it will promote the local economical growth along the alignment.
7,491.128 mu of land will be acquired for the project construction (accounting for 50.66%
of acquired land including 32.9 % of paddy field and 17.7 % of dry land with low yield). The
route alignment is designed rationally by avoiding cities along the route. It will not have adverse
impacts on the life of the public by providing financial compensation and resettlement.
Effective engineering facilities will ensure that the water conservation facilities, surface
water regimes, highway networks can work well. 8 passageways will be built per 10 km for traffic
of the public and husbandry.
(5) Ambient Air
During the operation stage, the vehicular waste gases along alignment will have minor
impacts on the air due to the speedy wind and strong diffusion capacity.
(6) Water Quality
During the operation period, the storm-water coming from bridge surface will have slight
effects on the water quality in the Yinzi River and the Bawang River, with the water quality
50



remaining unchanged.
The domestic sewage from service centers, administrative divisions, toll stations and
maintenance sections and car-washing wastewater will affect water quality, so it cannot be
discharged before treated properly.
Although there is little possibility of risk of hazardous materials spill, it occurs accidentally
with severe consequences. Therefore, it is required that effective measures be taken to prevent it
from happening.
b. CONSTRUCTION PHASE
During construction phase, there is potential to have dust pollution and noise resulting from
heavy construction machinery, earth/lime mixing equipment and asphalt mixers. Vegetation will
be damaged as because of big borrow leading to great soil erosion. In addition, the sewage from
construction camps and garbage and bridge construction will have some effects on water quality.
Although the effect during the construction stage is short-term consequence, environmental
protection measures will be taken according to the Environmental Plans by strengthening
supervision and monitoring to reduce the impacts to a minimum or to be alleviated.
c. SUMMARY OF EIA
90. The construction of the highway from Laoyemiao to Jining will have remarkable both
financial and social benefits, so all community and public in the study area are in favor of it. The
alignment is designed rationally in the following ways: it has avoided Xinghe county town site and
the town of Jining City. Also, it has occupied as less farmland as possible. It will have minor
impacts on the living environment of the residents along the route during the operation phase. It
will not affect the ecological environment species and their features much. Under the
environmental protection measures in the Environmental Plans for the project, highway protection
works, drainage works will be ensured. As a result, the environment can be protected, and soil
erosion can be controlled or improved.
To conclude, from the viewpoint of environmental assessment, the project is feasible
because there are not any major environmental factors that will constrain its construction.
11. IINIP Roads
91. Environment Assessment of Present Status
(1 )Most of the project areas are needy counties and banners whose economy is not developed.
The economy along the alignment is mainly farming. completed with stock raising as complement.
The productivity is in lower level.
(2)Farmland is mainily distributed along the alignment and propagation resources lack. The
51



propagation species are widespread species, and no rare and valuable propagation species.
(3)The organic matter in soil is low, the vegetation covers small areas, soil erosion and
desertification are serious, and soil erosion presents sliglit--medium extend. The above situations
mean the ecological environment of project areas is flimsy.
(4)The project areas are villages and small towns, in which populations spread arouind. and
density of populations is low. The traffic volume is very lowv along the highways of HNIP. which
leads to no noise influence upon villages and clinics within 200m on both sides of the highwvays.
Monitoring results indicate the noise didn't exceed the standards, which means noise environiment
is good.
(5)According to the monitoring results, the atmosphere quality is good along the highways.
Atmosphere quality of the villages, schools and clinics along the alignment all correspond with1
class 11 standard in GB3095-1996.
92. Prediction analysis conclusion of impact on Environmenit
a. CONSTRUCTION PHASE
All sections of various sub-projlects belong to road improvement project. It is only required to
extend. strengtlhen and improve the existing road pavement without requiremcnt of land
requisition and residents' resettlement. Therefore, the environmental impacts done by the project
actions mainly include the following aspects:
(1) Noises and dust of construction equipinent and transport vehicles will affect the acoustic
and atmosphere environment of the sections of various sub-projects to some extent. It is necessary
to adopt environmental measures such as suitable construction time, working site and sanitarv
protection distances etc. to ensure the environimental quality of sensitive points inclusive of
schiools and hospitals along the highways.
(2) No rare animals and plants are found along the highways. The project construction will
not have obvious impact on rare animals and plants.
(3) The environmental ecological influence on vegetation and soils of the highways. It is only
required to take grade descending in some sections to form some filling-excavating slopes. In
addition, due to removal of some vegetation on slope, it will cause certain damage and water
erosion in some sections. But such can be controlled through environmental education during
construction and adopting suitable preventive measures such as to re-plant the vegetation
immediately after construction.
(4) The existing road will be half-open and half-construction during construction period, this
will obviously affect the traffic flows. Such shall require mitigation measures such as adopting
sectionalized construction and proper traffic leading.
b. OPERAT'ING PHASE
(1) During the operating period, with the increase of traffic flow every year, the noise level
will also increase. It is estimated tiat, as up to the operating period, the sensitive points nearby the
52



highways will received obvious traffic noises. Noise levels of some schools and hospitals mnay
exceed the environmental standards. It is necessary to adopt noise preventive measures for these
sensitive points of relative higher estimated values if necessary.
(2) Vehicle exhausted gas and dust will reduce the atmosphere quality along the highways
during the operating period. But this will not exceed the assessing standards during short-term
period because of small traffic volume.
(3)Afforestation and vegetation restoration will improve the ecological environment along
the alignment, which benefits water and soil conservancy and prevents soil desertification in sonme
parts of the project areas.
(4)No culture relics were found along the alignment, so there will be no effect on culture
relics during constructioni.
C. SUMMARY OF IEE
The HNIP will improve local transportation conditions. bringing considerable social and
economic benefits for these areas, also playing important roles in promoting resources exploitation,
enhancing the unity among the nationalities in the minority areas, makinig the society stable,
increasing income and obtaining employment opportunities of local people, and reducing the
poverty population in the needy areas along the highways.
On the basis of analyzing atmosphere, noise, ecological environment, culture relics and road
safety, etc. to raise the mitigation measures in EAP. While these measures are put into
implementation, the negative effect will be get rid of in construction, and ecological environment
will be improved as well due to afforestation.
Local people in ditferent levels all support the project witli positive attitude. The HNIP is
feasible on aspect of environment.

Preventive Schemes against Soil Erosion of Laoyemiao-Jining Highway
A. Bases of Schemes and Objectives
(1). Policy and regulations:

Technical Specifications for Water and Soil Conservancy Developments issued by Ministry of
Water Conservancy (SL204-98 )
Design Specifications for Road Subgrade by MOC (JTJO13-95)
Project Feasibility Study Report
(2). Objectives
Minimum damage to water and soil conservancy facilities and compensation if any.
Proper disposal of waste of earth and stone.
No hidden perils of slide and collapse
Topsoil restored and exposed surface covered with vegetation.
Engineering measures against soil erosion put forward
B. Mitigation Measures against Hydraulic Erosion
(1). Subgrade protection works
Reliable subgrade protection works will be designed for the project.
*   Protection of fill embankment
When the subgrade is -4m, the slope is protected with plantation of grasses. Bushes and
arbor trees are planted at toe to the border of right-of-way.
When the subgrade is 4-5m,the slope is protected by using slurry schist and/or plantation
of grasses.
When the subgrade is>5m,mortar schist retaining wall is placed below 1/2 or 1/3 of the
slope.
When the subgrade is >6m, below 6m, slurry schist slope is used. .
At the vicissitudinous section in width and depth of the river (K277+500), T-type dams
are built to slow down water speed.
At partial sections of sand and wind erosion, gentle slope is used, and on it grasses are
planted and sand barriers are built. The cut slope is 1; 2-1: 3. .
* Subgrade protection of cutting
When the cut is -3m deep, earth slopes will be planted with grasses.
When the cut is 3-5m, earth slopes will be protected with mortar arches in diamond shape,
in which grasses are planted. In case of weathered rocks, the slope will be gentle to prevent
rocks from falling
When the cut is> 1 2m, terraced slopes are adopted, the platform being 1 .5m-2.Om wide
with the height difference of 6m- I Om. At the lowest part, masonry pitching of slope is used.
In case of weathered rocks, facing walls are used to prevent rocks from falling.

*    Slope protection at sections with poor geology
At 319-K322, K324-K325 the highway is of rock cutting. The slope is expected to
protect with short walls. M7.5 mortar schist and Ml0 slurry facing will be used with a discharge
outlet every I Om.
According to the feasibility study report, the whole alignment is provided with drainage
ditches, side ditches, chutes and retarding walls. The total amount of drainage works is 206134 m3.

* Highway Greening
Highway greening involves slope grass plantation, greening of toe, border, interchanges and
median dividers. Greening is also a means of water and soil conservancy. The amount of greening
within right-of-way is presented in Table 3-3. Considering water and soil conservancy,
requirements of highway greening are as follows:
Within the right-of-way all areas except pavement and other permanent structures will be
planted with trees and grasses.
Site-specific species will be chosen for plantation. Suitable species are poplar, elm, willow
and some other arbors. Some other plants that have properties to conserve water and soil will also
be planted.
65



C. Control Measures against Wind Erosion
Wind erosion occurs mainly at borrow sites. Besides, vegetation damage during
construction phase should also receive special attention. The following are the mitigation
measures against wind erosion:
*    Land control
Borrow area should be located at centralized sites.
The slope of cut should be gentle enough to avoid soil erosion.
On completion of the project, temporary land should be cleared up for rehabilitation
*   Measures against desertification of soil
The 16 borrow sites are proposed to be located at hilly areas. Owing to the fact that it is very
fry and windy, it is difficult to restore vegetation in a short time after excavation for borrow.
Therefore, the following measures are expected to take to prevent soil desertification:
Straw squares will be placed. After clearing up, borrow sites and other temporary sites will
be placed with straw squares to stop deserticating at these areas because of wind erosion.
Grasses will be planted. In straw squares grass seeds will be sown that resist drought,
tolerate poor and barren soil and resist wind.
D. Implementation Management of Water and Soil Conservancy Plans
(1). Management Measures
The Freeway Company (High-speed Highway Headquarter) and its branch agencies of Inner
Mongolia are responsible for the implementation of the plans. Their responsibilities are: to have
the construction drawings designed; to identify design requirements in tender as contract; to
strengthen monitoring and supervision in construction management. Environmental personnel and
technicians will participate in acceptance. In operation, full-time staff will be in charge of water
and soil conservancy in routine and maintenance work.
(2). Technical measures
Traits of technicians and their awareness of environmental protection will be integrated in
inviting tender.
The construction supervisors should know their jobs very well in water and soil
conservancy.
Both the employers and contractors will set aside enough funding for personnel training,
monitoring and investigation
E. Summary
Enough protection works and complete drainage works will be installed for the embankment
of Laoyemiao to Jining Highway. To meet the requirements in this statement, the subgrade
protection design of sections of week geology  (K3 1 9-K325) will be paid particular attention.
On completion of the project, greening should be done within the highway right-of-way, at borrow
sites and other temporary sites for restoration of vegetation including reclamation and
rehabilitation. By doing so, the erosion resulting from construction can be reduced by 50-60%.
In 3-5 years of operation, the erosion intensity will be restored to the original levels due to the
greening project and complete facilities. As time passes by, the vegetation along the route will
grow healthily and densely, thus the erosion will be alleviated greatly. As a result, the ecological
environment will be improved.
66



Based on the above analysis, we can conclude that the project will not have any
uncontrollable environmental problems of soil erosion on condition that all mentioned protection
works are implemented as required.
