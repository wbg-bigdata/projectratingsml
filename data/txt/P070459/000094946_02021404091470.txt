PREFACE
The projected Laoyemiao (on the border of Hebei province and Inner Mongolia) to Jining
Highway is 91.28 km long. It is one section of the second East-West Highway of the "Five North-
South and Seven East-West Highway " configurations under planning of China. The second East-
West Artery Highway stars from Dandong via Beijing and destined at Lhasa, one of the major
passageways connecting Northeast China, North China, Inner Mongolia, Ningxia, Gansu, Qinghai
and Tibet. The construction of the projected highway will play a substantially important role in
booming the economy and extending the opening of Inner Mongolia and western provinces or
regions of China. The Inner Mongolia Communications Department (IMCD) asked the Inner
Mongolia Transport &Traffic Design Institute (IMTTD) to undertake compilation of "the Project
Feasibility Study Report" (PESR). The report was completed in November 1998. In order to carry
out the EIA simultaneously as the study report, the IMCD entrusted Xi'an Highway University to
work out the EIA statement on December 4, 1998. Immediately after taking the task, a task force
consisting of technicians and designers was organized and a field specific survey was conducted in
detail. Based on the survey and information obtained, the TOR for EIA was worked out in January
1999. The TOR was reviewed and examined by the Assessment Center of the National
Environmental Protection Agency (NEPA). Taking account into the reply to the TOR and the
opinions of the experts, we conducted a further field survey and investigation, and the EIA
statement (Chinese version) was compiled December 1999.
June 9, 2000, the environmental impact statement was pre-examined by the Environmental
Protection Section under the MOC, and it was improved and added according to the opinions of
the experts and representatives.
August, 2001, the Environmental Impact Statement was revised and added according to the
new version of the Engineering Feasibility Study Report complied by IMTTD in Feb. 2001.
October, 2001, the EIS was further modified according to Mission Aide Memoire
(September 22-28, 2001).
We express our genuine thanks to the following institutions and companies for their
generous help in our assessment: IMCD, Inner Mongolia Environmental Protection Bureau
(IMEPB), IMTTDI, Inner Mongolia Meteorology Division (IMMD), Wulanchabu League
Communications Section (WLCS) and Wulanchabu League Environmental Monitoring Station
(WLEMS).

Environmental Impact Statement for Laoyemiao-Jining Highway
1 GENERAL DESCRIPTION
1.1 Necessity for the Project Construction
The highway from Laoyemiao (on the border of Inner Mongolia and Hebei) to Jining of the
national artery from Dandong to Lhasa (called Laoyemiao to Jining Highway or the Proposed highway
hereinafter) is a section of Dandong-Beijing-Lhasa Highway in Inner Mongolia, one of the planned
national artery highway configuration. It is a truck line connecting north China and the northwest of
China. It is also one of the most important passageways to the outside. Its construction will definitely
promote the formation of economic zones in both the central cities and areas along the proposed project,
promoting the economical boom and investment environment in these areas. It will play a substantially
important role in exploitation of resources and transport of agricultural and husbandry products in the
central and western parts in Inner Mongolia. In addition, the construction of the alignment will speed up
the passage capacity of the national artery highways, thus encouraging the highway construction and
improving the infrastructure facilities of highway in Inner Mongolia.
The destination of the proposed alignment is Jining, the capital of Ulanchabu League, 360 km away
from Beijing and 120 km from Hohhot, and 240 km from Zhungeer coalfield, one of the national key
energy bases. It is 270 km away from Baotou, the largest industrial city in Inner Mongolia. The City of
Hohhot is one of the important "economic growth zones" of Northeastern Asia Economic Ring and the
urban systems of the Economic Belt round Bo Sea. It is also one of the focused points of opening of the
north borders, being one of the leading cities in booming the economy in minority regions in the
development strategy of the country. Hohhot together with Baotou and Yikezhao League has formed the
"Gold Triangle" of abundant resources in Inner Mongolia. Therefore, the construction of the highway
will be of great significance in improving contact with outside and extent of opening, and thereby
encouraging the economic growth in the central part in Inner Mongolia. It will also play an important
role in the commodity circulation and getting rid of poverty in the towns, counties or banners. To sum up,
the construction of Laoyemiao to Jining Highway is not only necessary, but also substantially urgent.
1.2 Purposes of Assessment
1.  Survey, monitoring and analysis of the pertinent natural environment, social surroundings and
the existing situation of environmental quality;
2.  Prediction (analysis) and assessment of the impacts of the projected highway on the
environment along the proposed highway during both the construction phase and operation phase;
3.  Proof of the positive and negative impacts on the environment on both sides resulting from the
highway construction and putting forward necessary environmental protection measures to minimize the
adverse impacts to get coordination of highway construction and environmental protection;
4.  Proof of the feasibility of alignment and construction of the highway from the viewpoint of
environmental protection;
5.  Provision of information for environmental management in the projected highway and in the
design of environmental protection works.

Environmental Impact Statement for Laoyemiao-Jining Highway
2 BASELINE INTRODUCTION TO THE PROJECT
2.1 Geographical Position, Route Alignment and Major Controlling Points
2.1.1 Geographical Position
The total length of Laoyemiao to Jining Highway is 91.28 km. The recommended whole route is a
completely new alignment. It lies in the mid-western part of Inner Mongolia being one section
connecting Hohhot and Jining as major cities in Inner Mongolia. It passes through Xinghe County and
the City of Jinning. For its geographical location, see Figure 2-1.
2.1.2 Major Controlling Points
The starting point of the recommended option is at Laoyemiao on the border between Inner
Mongolia and Hebei Province (Station K273+720). It heads from east for west to the destination (at
station K365+000, Sanhaonandi of Jining via Chengguan Town of Xinghe County (south of the town),
Toudaunaobao, Jiabazibei, Niuming Village, Bayintala and Shaquan. The main line crosses 208 National
Highway here.
2.1.3 Route Alignment (Recommended Option)
Laoyemiao to Jining Highway goes from east to west in principle. The section from Laoyemiao to
Toudaonaobao goes in the south of the existing highway. However, the section from Toudaonaobao to
Niuming Village the proposed alignment goes in the north of the existing highway. For more detail, refer
to Appendix Figure.
2.2 Construction Scale and Major Technical Standards
The total length of the recommended route is 91.28 km with a total cost of 1,779,373,900 yuan
RMB. It is suggested that the whole line be newly built by adopting expressway technical standards. The
width of subgrade is 26 m. The construction period is three years (2002-2004). The major technical
indexes are shown in Table 2-1.

2.4.1 Subgrade
(1) Subgrade width
Based on the feasibility study report, the width of subgrade for the whole line is 12.5 x 2 m with a
median divider of 3.0 m. On either sides of the dividers, there is a curb belt with a width of 0.75 m.
There are two driving lanes with each being 3.75 m wide. There are a 3.25 m hard shoulder and a 0.75
m earth shoulder. The standard subgrade sectional drawing is presented on Figures 2-2(a) and 2-2(b).
(2) Subgrade slopes
Section of filling: When the elevation of filling is less than 6 m, the cut slope is IH:1.5V. While
the elevation is more than 6 m, the cut slope is 1: 1.5 at the upper part and 1:1.75 at the lower part with
the division at 6 m.
Sections of cutting: In case of earth cutting, the cut slope is 1:1.0; in case of stone cutting with
light wind erosion, the cut is 1:0.3; in case of stone cutting with severe wind erosion, the slope is 0.75;
when the elevation of cutting is higher than 20m, the slope is 1:0.5 or 1: 1.0 depending on the extent of
wind erosion.
(3) Subgrade protection
For general sections, the cut slopes are protected with mansonry meshes and grasses; for the dry
sections, the slope are protected with mansonry meshes and clay covers; for the cutting sections, the
slopes are protected with slurry schists depending on the conditions.

3 BASELINE ENVIRONMENTAL DESCRIPTION
3.1 Pertinent NaturalAspects
3.1.1 Geographical Location
The proposed alignment lies in the central western part of Inner Mongolia, 40-4l degree north
latitude, II1l-114 degree east longitude. The alignment goes from east to west. It is connected in the
east to Zhangjiakou to Laoyemiao Highway heading for Beijing at the beginning. In the west it is
connected to Hohhot to Baotou expressway at the destination.
3.1.2 Landform, Topography, Geology and Seism
The projected alignment is situated on the Chahaer lava bench land on the south edge of Inner
Mongolian Plateau. It is obvious that the exposure of basalt is resulted from north-east and east-west
faulty belt. The alignment takes right angle to the belt. Basalt is underlain by purplish red lam and gravel
layers. There are many small structural basins between the bench lands with some being lakes.
Topographically, the section between Laoyemiao to Yushuwang is of loess hilly area underlain by stone
bind and conglomerate with severe wind erosion. Section between Yushuwang to Taigou is typical lava
bench land.
The seismic intensity is VI - Vlll degree.
3.1.3 Climate
The project area belongs to temperate continental monsoon climate zone with plentiful sunshine. It
is dry and windy. It rains seldom. The mean annual precipitation is 365-404 mm. The rainfall is
focused mainly in July through September. The average evaporation is above 1400 nmm. Sandstorms
occur frequently in April. The annual windy days are averaged to be 30 days. The average wind speed is
3.4-3.6 m/s. N-W wind prevails here. There are great temperature differences in various seasons with
an average annual temperature being between 3.6-4.8'C. The lowest temperature is -33.8°C and the
highest temperature being 35.7°C. Fog-free spell is 105 -130 days. The deepest snow deposit is 30 cm.
The thickest frozen depth is about 1.9 m. For the meteorological elemnent, see Table 3-1(data from
Xinghe and Jining Meteorological Stations).

3.1.4 River Regime
The rivers the alignment crosses are all seasonal with no water in dry seasons, but floods occur
very often in rainy seasons. The major rivers in the study area are Bawang River, Toutao River, Niuming
River and Yinzi River. Baowang River, Niuming River and Toudao River flow into the Huangqi lake,
which is about 10 km away from the alighment; Yinzi river flows into Yongding River.
The water regime and rivers are shown in Figure 3-1.
Baowang river: Rising from Yin mountainous ranges, the river goes east till Hongqi lake. Bawang
River is reconmmended as water resources to be protected by IUCN. Today, It is used mainly for
irrgation.

Yinzi river:: It rises from the south of Xinghe County. Its mean annual runoff is 13.64 million rn3.
It belongs to Yongding river regime. It is used for irrigation.
Huangqi lake: It is located in Chahaheyouyiqian Banner, 10 km from the planned alignment. The
water area is 8,733 ha. No natural fish occur due to bad water quality. It is used mainly for tourism. This
lake is regarded as an important source of water for surrounding areas by IUCN mainly for irrgation..
In the low hilly area, fissure water is buried deep. In some low areas the ground water is relatively
high, but below 1.5 m.

3.2.3 Vegetation Types
1.  Vegetation
The vegetation in the area is sparse with forest cover of 10.1% growing mostly on the bench land
along the rivers or around villages. There are some patchy woods on the hill slopes with poplars and
elms in the lead. But they grow poorly. Some artificial bushes and forage grasses grow very well. The
natural vegetation is very poor with a cover of only about 10 30%.
For forest resources please refer to Table 3-2, and for vegetation distribution, see Figure 3-4.

2.. Forest Land
The study area is one of the key areas of "Three North Protection Forest". It is also one area of
serious soil erosion. According to the "Protection Forest Construction Plan', afforestation will be carried
out on a large scale wherever possible in this area.
3. Grassland
Based on the landform, topography and some meteorological elements such as heat and water, the
grassland vegetation can be fallen into: Grassy deserts, desertificated grassland, dry grassland, hilly
grassland and hilly meadows. For the varieties of grassland structure, see Table 3-3.

The natural pastures have been deteriorated badly because of dry climate, scarce rainfall, strong
winds and plenty sands and human activities. It is very essential that in the construction of this highway
vegetation protection and afforestation be paid special attention to avoid further desertification.
3.2.4 Farming
According to the general agricultural divisions, food grains other than wheat and rice and cash crops are
grown in this area. See Figure 3-5. Agriculture output of each district and county is shown in Table 3-4

Note: Data in the table are of 1998.
Farming is the main industry of agriculture including wheat, potato, millet, corn and Chinese
sorghum etc. The wheat average yield per mu is 130 kg, and that of potato is 300 kg. Cash crops are oil
plants, sugar beet, vegetables, mellows, tobacco, Chinese medicine herbs and hops and so on. The
multiple cropping index is very low because of the severe natural conditions. In general, only one crop
is obtained in one year. For the utilization of land along the alignment, see Table 3-5.
Table 3-5                 Land Utilization                                Unit: 10000/mu

Table 3-5 demonstrates that farmland is lacking. Therefore, it is substantially important to protect
farmland resources in construction of the project.
3.2.5 Wild Flora and Fauna
1. Flora
Figure 3-4 (page 18) is the flora distribution along the alignment. It can be seen that the
vegetation in proposed project area mainly belongs to dry farmland and grassland vegetation. Wild
plants occur mainly in the typical pasture areas among hills. There are 15- 20 species of plants per
square meter. They are needle grasses, prairie sagewort, korshinskpeashrub, etc. On the western bank of
the rivers patchily distributed are splendid achnatherum, sedge, razor grass, and Chinese small iris and
other species that are salinity and alkali resistant. Among hills and on waste lands wormwood, sand
fleabane, and green bristle grass occur there. According to the description of wild fauna and flora along
the area of Jining-Laoyemiao highway (Annex Vl-1), which was made by the Ulanqab League Forestry
Bureau, no wild vegetation is listed in category of protection.
2. Fauna
In Ulanqab League, there used to be Mongolian gazelle, deer, wolves, foxes, hares, eagles, owls
and chukars, etc. However, owing to the damage of ecological environment, the number and species of
these wild animals are being reduced sharply. Nowadays, the route areas are mainly farming areas and
densely populated area for living and production (see Figure 3-5). Based on the survey report by the
Ulanqab League Forestry Bureau (Annex VI-1), there are a few hares and sand grouses along the
alignment area, which belong to non-protected animals of state, region and county. In addition, the
protected areas for wild fauna and flora of Inner Mongolia are beyond Ulanqab League ( see Figure 3-
6).
20



Environmental Impact Statement for Laoyemiao-Jining Highway
3.2.6 Natural Protected Areas
Both existing and planning natural protected areas in Inner Mongolia are shown in Figure 3-6.
From Figure3-6, the proposed highway is far away from those protected areas. Therefore, the
construction of the project does not affect these natural protected areas.
3.3 Socio-economic Situation
3.3.1 General Economics
1. Areas impacted
The proposed highway will connect the city of Hohhot, the capital of Inner Mongolia and Baotou,
the largest industry city to the city of Jining of Wulanchabu League by means of a fast, safe, economic
and comfortable expressway. The alignment passes through the whole Wulanchabu League. The directly
impacted areas are: Xinghe County, Jining City, Chaharyouyiqian, Zhouzi County, urban areas of
Hohhot, and urban areas of Baotou. Indirectly impacted areas are: Hebei Province (beyond Zhangjakou),
Shanxi Province (beyond Tatong), banners under Wulanchabu League, counties under Hohhot City, the
northeastern part of Yikechao League and the eastern part of Bayanneer League.
2. Economic Situation in the impacted areas
The directly impacted areas are in the central Inner Mongolia with an area of 19231 (km)2 and a
population of 3.6897 million people. The density of population is 191.86 persons /(km)2, much higher
than the average in the region. The proposed alignment passes through Wulanchabu league, the city of
Hohhot, a traffic hub and corridor in Inner Mongolia. The impacted areas are rich in natural resources
involving iron, rare earth, gold, coal, graphite, marble, limestone and clay, etc.
Hohhot, the capital and the center of politics, economy and culture of Inner Mongolia
Autonomous Region, is one of the famous cultural cities. Now it has developed into the center of
industry and trade. The major industries are textile, electronics, machinery, food processing, petrolem
chemical industry, building materials, metallurgy and wool spinning which accounts for 50% of that of
the whole region.
Jining, the capital of Wulanchbu league, is the center of politics, economy and culture of the
league. It serves as a door of the economic development of Inner Mongolia and a traffic hub to the
northwest as well. Jining is one of the largest fur markets and fur processing bases in the country. Fur
and leather industry is the key industry in the region. Panda brand leather garments enjoy good
reputation both at home and abroad.
The economic situation in 1998 of Xinghe County, Chahaeryouqian Banner and Jining City is in
Table 3-6.

Environmental Impact Statement for Laoyemiao-Jining Highway
Highway are between class 2 and 3; Laoyemiao to Jining Highway is class 2, which can not meet
requirements as a trunk line connecting the northwest and Beijing. (2) The whole line is a mixed traffic
with a running speed of about 40 km per hour. Congestion have often occurs during peak hours. Only
the construction of a high-class highway can meet the need for modem traffic to encourage the rapid
economic boom in this area.
The projected alignment is the most important trunk route in the middle-western Inner Mongolia
from west to east. It intersects the planned Erlianhot-Hekou National Trunk Highway at Jining forming
cross-type highway framework. In addition, it connects other provincial and country roads like S304 and
S305. There are other 4 highways, namely S 101, S102, S103 and S104 radiating from Hohhot outwards.
All these roads plus the country roads together have formed a smooth transport network.
2. Rail
The existing railways here are: Beijing-Baotou rail, Jining -Erlian rail and Jining-Tongliao rail.
Besides, there are four branch lines and private lines.
3. Aviation
There are two international air routes and more than 40 domestic air routes at Hohhot airport.
All the highways, rails and civil aviation have formed a comprehensive transport system with
Hohhot and Jining as the centers.
3.3.3 Education and Health Care
According to survey, there are primary schools at all big villages, and high school at towns. There
are hospitals at county towns. There are also other essential services like public transport, post service,
communication, etc. For detail, see Tables 3-7 and 3-8.

23.5 Cultural Relics
According to the survey report on cultural relics along the proposed alignment areas (Annex VI-2),
which was conducted by the Inner Mongolia Institute of Cultural Relics and Archaeology, there are no
important cultural relics and cemeteries along the road construction area. See Annex VI-2.
3.4 Identification of Environmentally Sensitive Spots
In the light of "Technical Specifications for EIA for Highway Projects"-JTJO05-96 issued by
MOC, environmental sensitive points include village, school, etc. within the scope of 200m on both
sides of the road. By investigation, there are only 7 villages, which locate on both sides of the scope of
200m along the proposed highway and are identified as sensitive points (see following figure). The
environmentally   sensitve locations (areas) affected by the planned Laoyemiao-Jining Highway
(recommended option) are presented in Table 3-10.

3.5 Existing Environment along the Route
3.5.1 Current Soil Erosion
*    Types of Soil Erosion
There are varieties of soil erosion among which are wind erosion and hydraulic erosion. Wind
erosion occurs everywhere, mainly in dry grassland in March - May. Hydraulic erosion is found mainly
in loess hilly areas in July-September when it rains very often. Ablation of exposed rocks occurs
because of sunshine and temperature difference. There are some other kinds of erosion.
* Area and extent of Soil Erosion
The soil erosion module, along the road area, is between 500-2000t/km2 -a, belonging to light erosion.
For the erosion area and its damage extent see Table 3-1 1; for erosion intensity see Table 3-12.

* Causes of Soil Erosion
Causes of soil erosion are: (1) centralized rainstorms with strong intensity and scouring. The
mean precipitation along the route is 365.6-404.7mm centralized in June -September. The maximum
rainfall in 24 hours is 151.6 mm; (2) loose soil with poor adhesion leading to easy scouring; (3)
Reclamation of wasteland on a large scale resulting in deterioration of soil.
Wind erosion is attributed to strong wind, too much sand in soil, dry top soil and sparse
vegetation.
* Alleviation of Soil Erosion at Present
To protect national resources and mitigate soil erosion, the following measures will be taken: water and
soil conservancy measures combined with biological measures in hilly areas; farmland construction
combined with afforestation in flood plains. See Table3-13 for detail.

3.5.2 Monitoring and Assessment of existing noise environment quality
*    Environmental noise monitoring
According to the TOR for EIA, the environmental engineering institute of Xi'an Highway
University conducted measurement for sound environment at chosen acoustic sensitive points along the
proposed road . Measurement method is based on GB/T 14623-93( measuring method for environmental
noise of urban area).
1. Noise levels of village environment
Five villages were chosen to measure existing noise levels and measured results are shown in Table
3-14. For some locations of measuring points, see Fig.3-7.

* Assessment on existing sound environment
From Table 3-14, Table 3-15, we know the assessment results of sound environmental quality
along the planned route as follows:
1. In the rural areas, the noise levels at daytime Leq=42.4 to 56.0 dB, Leq=34.4 to 49.5dB at
night, which meets class 4 standard in GB3096-93 (Environmental Noise Standards in Urban Areas)
2. At sensitive spot of school (Dagong elementary school) Leq=45.5dB at daytime , Leq=37.7 at
night, which meets class I standard in GB3095-93. The noise level on both sides of existing highway
can meets class 4 standard at daytime and also meets class 4 standard at 50 meters from the road at night
We can conclude that the sound environmental quality along the proposed route is quite good and
the residents and villagers enjoy a quiet environment.

*    Assessment on existing air quality
I . The hourly average concentrations of CO at two places is between 0.42-4.07 mg/m3; the daily
average concentrations is 1.01-2.16 mg/m3, both are the below class-two criterion of National Ambient
Air Quality, respectively (GB3095-1996) (10.0 mg/m3 and 4.00 mg/rn3).
2. The average hourly and daily concentrations of NO2 is between 0.002-0.046 mg/m3 and
0.002-0.026 mg/m3, not exceeding the class II standards (0.015 mg/m3 and 0.10 mg/m3) in  GB3095-
1996
3. The average daily level of TSP is between 0.142-0.253 mg/m3, below the class-two standard
(0.3 mg/m3) in GB3095-1996.
It can be seen that along the alignment of the proposed road, the concentrations of CO, NO2 and
TSP are low, So it has a great acceptance capacity. the local air quality is fairly good.
3.5.4 Assessment on existing water quality

4.1.4 Determination of Parameters in Prediction Model
1. Vehicular speeds and average referent radiation noise level
The driving speed on the expressway may be considered as uniform. According to the design
standards, the constant speeds of different types of vehicles are shown in Table 4-3. The radiation noise
level depends on the speed, types of vehicles and properties of pavement. For this prediction, the model
developed by Xi'an Highway University through many tests and analysis on high-class highway is
adopted. See Table 4-3.

2. Hourly traffic volume
The hourly traffic volume (Ni)of assessment years is shown in Table 4-2 based on traffic
volume prediction and types of vehicles.
3. Attenuation factor by ground cover
Because the study areas are mainly farmland or wasteland, the attenuation factor of noise
spread to ground cover a =0.5.
4. Additional attenuation of noise by embankment when traveling
(1) Estimating the attenuation by embankment structure
32



Environmental Impact Statement for Laoyemiao-Jining Highway
For most part of the highway, the subgrade is on the high embankment, which results in
additional attenuation to traffic noise spread. The additional attenuation is calculated as below:
2,5   f
N =-=         x a
A    170                             (4-6)
6 =D,+D2-D
where: a -the-length difference of sound travel (Fig.4-1);
f -equivalent frequency of traffic noise, f=500Hz;
N - Flesnel number.
Road structural attenuation can be obtained by using sound barrier attenuation curve according
to Flesnel number
(2) The addition attenuation by rural housing
The addition attenuation by rural housing is calculated according to Table 4-4.
Fig. 4-1 Sketch for Attenuation by Embankment

Increase of every one more      Increment 1.5dB
others                 More rows                  Max. A s=IOdB
4. 2 Impact Assessment of Traffic Noise Level
1. Noise level prediction at sensitive spots
The noise exposure levels are obtained by superposing traffic noise and background value (existing
noise level) (formula 4-5). The distributions of the noise levels at different spots along the proposed
highway in 2005, 2010, 2015 and 2025 are shown in Fig.4-2. From Figure 4-2, we know the noise levels
of sensitive locations in the study area during operation phase that are listed in Table 4-5.
2. Impact assessment on acoustic environment
we know the noise levels of sensitive locations in the study area during operation phase that are
listed in Table 4-5.
According to the noise levels of sensitive locations in the study area during operation phase that
are listed in Table 4-5, the noise impacts are assessed as follows:

(1)    The distance from the Dagong School to the proposed highway is 140m. The section of
the road near the school is moat configuration. In addition, there is a hill between the school and the
propose road. The hill has a function of natural sound barrier and greatly reduce the impact of traffic
sound, caused by the highway on the school . Figure 4-3 shows the situation.
(2) The noise levels of highway traffic to village residential areas in daytime can basically meet
Class 4 (70dB) of standard of environmental noise of urban area.
(3 ) The highway traffic noise has some impacts on villagers at nighttime depending on distance
from the highway. In 2010 the noise levels at night will not exceed Class 4 by 3.0dB, in 2015, 6.0dB, in
37

2020, 7.0dB, and in 2025, 8.OdB.
(4) The traffic noise has some impacts on near by Bashixiang, Dajing and Gaomiaozi villages.
Because Bashixiang and Dajing villages are very close to the highway with the nearest distance of only
I Sm, the excess levels are 2.0, 3.0,4.0, 7.0 and 8.0 dB(A) in 2005, 2010, 2015, 2020, 2025 individually.
the noise excess values of levels at night at Gaomiaozi village are 1.0, 2.0,3.0 and 5.0 dB in
2010,2015,2020 and 2025. Therefore, mitigation measures at both villages are necessary.
It is known that the highway will not have impacts on Dagong "Hope" Primary School and
will not have notable effects on acoustic environment of sensitive locations in daytime during operation
phase if Class 4 is adopted. However, at night it has effects to some extent. It has some impacts on
Gaomiaozi, Bashixiang and Dajing villages at night. To alleviate the impacts, measures will be taken.

4. 3 Mitigation Measuresfor Traffic Noise
4.3.1 Engineering Measures
At the villages noise level exceeding the Class IV of environment noise standard in urban area
(GB3096-93) in operation phase (2025), according to their locations to the highway, the following
measures are expected to take (See Table 4-6):
1. lOmrX200m of forest strip will be planted between Gaomiaozi Village and the highway to
reduce noise by 2.0 dB. In long-term operation the excess will be less than 3.0dB.
2. The noise levels will be reduced by about 3.54.0dB by removing some houses beyond 40 m
from the central line of the road at both Bashixiang and Dajing Villages.
After three viDlages will be achieved above mitigation measures, The noise levels can
basically be in compliance with Class 4 standards of GB3096-93. (day :70 dB, night: 55dB)

road in long-term operation can be reduced.
2. Although there are existmg protection forests around the villages and at other places, the
public and governments will be told to plant more trees. So, the noise levels will be lower the
predicted ones despite the increasing traffic.

4.4.1 Analysis of Noise Source during Construction Phase
The noise during construction comes from construction machinery and haulage vehicles. The
commonly used construction machines are excavators, bulldozers, levelers, mixers and rollers. Their
noise levels at different distances under full load are in Table 4-8.

Note: the noise level s at a distance of Sm are the actual levels monitored
4.4.2 Analysis of Impacts on Acoustic Environment
According to the noise standards for construction site (GB12523-90),the noise limit in daytime
is 70-75 dB, 55 dB at night. Table 4-8 shows:
I. The noise level of the machinery at 40 m beyond in daytime can meet the standard; at 200
m beyond at night.
2. Most villages in the study sections are beyond 40 m. So construction in daytime will not
have noticeable impact on residents; however, at night it does.
4A.1 Noise Mitigation during Construction Phase
1. High-noise producing machinery will not be allowed to operate (22:00-6:00) at sections
in close vicinity of residential areas such as Dajing Village (K333 + 300, Gaomiaozi village
(K281+450) and Bashixiang village (K327+200).
2. Machinery operators and construction workers will be protected with provisions like
earplugs and helmets.
3. Quarries, mixing sites, and asphalt mixers should be located :lm00   from sensitive
places.
4. The major haulage routes will be chosen as far as possible from villages and schools and
other sensitive locations.
4. 5   Summaries ofAcoustically Environmental Assessment
I. During the operation phase (2005-2025), the traffic noise will not have notable effects on
acoustic environmnent of villages in daytime. The noise levels in the study areas can basically be in
compliance with Class 4 of GB3096-93.
2. During operation phase, the traffic noise will have effects on villages to some extent at
night. In long-term of operation, the levels will exceed the standards at 3 villages, with Gaomiaozi
Village, Dajing Village and Bashixiang Village in particular.
3. If measures in Table 4-6 are taken, the excess levels can be controlled.
4. Since the noise impacts is of short-term, they can be reduced to a minimum by
strengthening mmagement, implementing monitorng and supervision, and by taking mitigation
measures.
To sum up, based on the assessment of acoustic environment there are no uncontrollable noise
pollution problems. Therefore, the project is feasible.

The table shows that the amount of land used for the highway accounts for 0.51% of the
total farmland. 0.043 mu will be reduced per farmer and 2.823 kg of grain will be lost per person.
This means that the land use for the project has minor effects on the general land use along the
study area with the integrated pattern unchanged. However, in order to reduce the impacts to a
minimum, the land for temporary use like mixing sites, borrow sites or construction access roads
will be rehabilitated for farming.
5.1.2 Measures for Land Protection
To minimize the impacts the following engineering and management measures are proposed
to take:
1. The alignment will avoid high-yield farmland as possible by using wasteland or dry land.
The ratio of land used for highway construction: 38.1% of wasteland, 50.7% of arable land
including 32.9% of paddy field.
2. "Shrinkage" slopes will be used in section of high-yield farmland by means of retaining
walls to protect subgrade to reduce land use.
3. Sites for materials storage and mixing use will be located within the range of land
acquired. Construction camping grounds will be in the rented existing buildings as possible.
4. To reduce occupation of farmland, borrow will be conducted centrally for embankment
fills. 16 borrow sites and 21 spoil sites have been identified with an area of 1,360 mu including
1,030 mu of hilly land, thus that amount of farmland saved.
5. Due to the fact that the land acquired lies in a corridor, the farmland will be reduced
much per person. For this reason, the farmers whose farmland has been acquired will be
reallocated with farmland.
6. Compensation for loss of land will be conducted in accordance with the local policies
and regulations to improve economy or living standards of the farmers.

5.2.1 Estimated Impact Extent on Vegetation during Construction Phase
1. Elements of impact on vegetation
Loss or damage of/to vegetation resulting from land acquisition, pernanent land use,
borrow and spoil sites will occur.
* Impacts of project on land use
The total amount of land occupied for the project is 7,491.28 mu including 3795.94 mu of
farmland, 307.83 muofgrassland, 2856.03 mu of wasteland and 323.24 muofwoods(See Table
5-l) . As a result of the construction of the project, all the vegetation will be lost.
* Inpacts of temporary land use
Land will be used temporally in construction phase for access roads, mixing sites, pre-
fabrication sites and/or construction campuses. The amount of land for temporary use is expected

* Impacts of Borrow and Spoil Sites
On both sides of the proposed road, 16 borrow pits and 19 spoil areas have been designed.
Both occupying 1,586 mu of land. See Figure 2-3. The vegetation there is subjected to destroying.
* Other factors during construction phase
The vegetation is prone to damage also because of the activities of construction workers and
machinery.
2. Estimated loss of biomass
Loss of woods is shown in Table 54. The data in the Table 5-4 is corrected based on the
investigation of the trees along the proposed road to date. The original data was based on the
preliminary Engineering Feasibility Study. During the period of the Engineering Feasibility Study,
for considerations of protecting environment, some sections of the proposed road kept away from
many woods. The estimated number of the tree to be cut has been reduced from 1 36,190 to 67,649.
Therefore, the total number of the tree to be cut has been decreased. In addition, tree planting will
be conducted after completion of construction of sections; scheme for tree planting is shown in
Figure 5-1. Rows of trees will be planted on both sides of the road with interval of about 3 m. The
number of tree planting totals 180,000 along the proposed highway; 85,737 trees will be planted in
the interchanges and land acquisition for the road, which add up to 266,737. The number of the
planted tree under the project will exceed that of the tree to be cut (67, 649) with 199,088.

5.22 Analysis of Impact on Vegetation
1. Analysis on iTpact of land use for right-of-way
The land use for highway right-of-way contributes to loss of vegetation. However, the
amount for this purpose is negligible compared with the total area of land there. See Tables 5-1
and 5-2. Therefore, the agricultural ecosystem and deserted pasture ecosystem will not be affected
remarkably. In addition, the current will be replaced with hard pavement (hard cover), planted
grasses and planted trees (soft cover). There will be no detrimental effects in this aspect.
2. Analysis on impact of borrow and spoil sites and temporary land use
The vegetation loss due to land use for borrow and spoil sites and other temporary use is of
short-term. However, it is difficult to restore the destroyed vegetation in Wu League owing to the
dry weather and sandy soil, sandy clay and desert gray soil that occur everywhere. Once the
vegetation is destroyed, loose top sand layers will occur, and will become thicker because of wind
erosion. As a result, there will be local desertification. Unfortunately, this impact is irrevocable.
5.2.3 Mitigation Measures for Impact on Vegetation
1. Vegetation protection measures during construction stage
(1) Protect trees within right-of-way, protection forests for irrigation channels in particular;
(2) Not cut trees within the temporary land if possible. Protection forests of soil
conservancy and irrigation channels are not allowed to cut;
(3) Trees beyond right-of-way are not allowed to cut, grass land and bushes should be
protected by strengthening management.
2. Reduce areas of borrow and spoil sites
The total area for borrow and spoil sites is about 1,586 mu, mostly in hilly areas having no
impacts on farmland. See Tables (0-2 and 6-3. To reduce desertification, elevation of embankment
will be lowered where appropriate so that the area for borrow and spoil sites can ereduced.
3. Rehabilitation of borrow and spoil sites
In construction, the activities of selection of borrow and spoil sites will be incorporated with
local agriculture development and general plan under consultation widt the local authorities. To
sum up, these sites will be rehabilitated as soon as possible.
4. Temporary land should be used as less as possible
During construction period it is advisable to locate the land for temporary use within the
highway right-of-way such as interchanges, service centers and toll stations. The construction
campuses and other sites should be rented in existing places. All the damaged vegetation and
44



Environmental Impact Statement for Laoyemiao-Jining Highway
exposed soil resulting from the construction will be rehabilitated as soon as the project is finished
(within and beyond the right-of-way).
5.2.4 Measures to Prevent Top Soil from Desertificating
The only way to prevent desertification due to the project construction is to compensate for
and/or restore surface vegetation.
1. Greening/planting trees and grasses within the right-of-way
Planting trees and grasses can protect subgrade, prevent soil erosion and beautify the view.
It can also better the ecological environment along the route. 85737trees and 349912m2 mu of
grass will be planted for this purpose. See Table 5-6.
2. Measures to Restore Vegetation
As soon as the project is completed, the land for temporary use will be cleared for
restoration of vegetation or reclamation where there are irrigation facilities. Where there are no
irrigation facilities, grasses will be planted in straw squares to prevent top-soil from desertification.
See Table 5-7.

1. The greening will be designed section by section depending on various requirements like
subgrade type, environment, highway view and induction of visual line, etc. Figure 5-1 is the
conceptual diagram for subgrade greening.

environment factors such as noise reduction and air pollution will also be taken into account
greening design. Greening design will be incorporated with the construction of local afforestation.
3. Embankment slopes will be sodded with violet alfalfa and wheatgrasses. Anti-wind
erosion bushes like salix mongolica will be planted at the areas below 1/3 of the slope. The design
of high retaining walls will be considered together with plant protection. When mortar stone
meshes are used, sod will be planted in the middle.
4. In case of embankment slopes and cut hillsides, engineering measured will be combined
with plant protection. When the cut slope is higher than 8 m, the slope will be protected by using
mortar schist or macadam at the toe. The surface will be protected by means of frames. In the
middle drought-enduring and sand-resist plants will be used.
5. The median dividers will be planted with drought-resist, wind resist species.
6. The design of interchanges will receive special attention. The design will be characterized
with local features including species of plants and patterns. In addition to plane design, vertical
design also should be integrated to forrn all sided greening. For example, sketch maps of Xinghe
Interchange is in Figures 5-2.
7. The greening at service centers should be in harmony with the planning and architecture
herein. Lawns, flower-bearing plants are suitable.
8. To ensure survival rate of plants, the plants need special care by full-time staff.
5.3.2 Implementation of Greening
1. Highway greening should have the following functions: safe, comfortable induction
vision, anti-dazzle features and beautiful landscape. Therefore, the greening should be designed by
authorized institutions.
2. To guarantee that the design is excellent, the design should be made as soon as the
general project design is completed.
3. A tender for greening design will be made and supervision will be conducted.
5.3.3 Analysis of Impact on Landscape
On either side of the proposed project there are mainly farmland, waste hills and
valleys with no beautiful scenery. On completion of the project, a new modern highway with
beautiful landscape will appear against the monotonous deserted pasture.
5.4 Summary of Impacts on Ecological Environment
1. Acquisition of land will not nave notable impacts on the pattern of land use along the
alignment. Permanent land use for the highway will contribute to loss of vegetation to some extent.
However, it will be made up for through greening, and as a result, the change of biomass will be
minor. Therefore, there will be no adverse impacts on kinds and features of ecological
environment.
2. The alignment of the projected highway is rational, for the land used is mostly dry land
with low yield ( 35% of the total). The loss of grains is less than 3 kg per person a year due to the
highway construction.
3. Local desertification will occur due to damage to vegetation at borrow and spoil sites
during construction period unless appropriate protection measures are taken. This kind of impact
is irrevocable because of severe wind erosion in this area. Therefore, measures will be taken to
restore vegetation at borrow sites and other construction sites. All measures to restore ecology in
the study report will be implemented. See Table 5-7
48



Environmental Impact Statement for Laoyemiao-Jining Highway
4. Greening within the whole right-of-way will compensate for the green land lost; in 5-8
years of operation of the highway, a green corridor along the highway will appear (a favorable
ecosystem) improving the ecological environment along the road.
To sum up, from the viewpoint of EIA, the alignment of the proposed highway is rational. It
will not have notable effects on ecological environment if measures mentioned in the report are
taken. Locally, the ecological environment will improve. Therefore, we can conclude that the
project is feasible environmentally.

6 PREDICTIONANALYSIS ONSOIL EROSIONAND
SUGGESTIONS SOIL CONSERVANCY
6.1 Predicted Impacts on Soil Erosion during Construction
The major soil erosion contributors are: great amount of earth/stone works in the
construction stage, exposed areas due to embankment fills, exposed surfaces due to excavation of
borrow and spoil sites, damaged water and soil conservancy facilities such as woods and
vegetation.
Soil erosion will result in damage to farmland, deterioration of crop-producing power and
loss of water, silting up of river-bed and so on.
6.1.1 Amount of Earth/Stone Works
The total length of the proposed alignment is 91.28 km. The total of earth/stone works is
9,376,910 m3 including 8,224,180 m3of earth works and 1, 1 52,730 m3 of stone works. The amount
of fills of earth and stone is expected to be 6,517,350 m3 involving 5,777,830 m3 coming from
cutting which accounts for 68.5% of cutting. The total amount of spoil totals up to 2,120,004 m3
of earth and stone. The amount of earth/stone works is listed in Table 6-1.

6.1.2 Analysis on the Rationality of Distribution of Borrow and Spoil Sites
Depending on the amount of earth, stone and sand and cost of materials, 16 sites are
expected to place including 6 quarries for schist or broken rock, 7 for sand or gravel, 2 for clay, I
for lime. See Tables 6-land 6-2. To protect farmland, all the sites will be located on hillsides or
wasteland. There will be 19 spoil sites (Table 6-3) occupying 320 mu of hilly land or wasteland.
Environmentally the amount of these sites and their distribution are rational.

6.1.3 Prediction Analysis on Soil Erosion during Construction Stage
Wulanchabu League through which the proposed highway passes has little rainfall but
rainfall centralizes. In addition, in the spring strong winds blow with sand, which leads to both
water and wind erosion there. See Table 4-3.
I Prediction of Intensity hydraulic erosion
(1) Prediction Model
For this assessment, a common model put forward by the Agriculture Ministry of America
is used, but with some revisions. The model is:
A=R K L, C P                                         (6-1)
where:    A-Erosion intensity ( t/ha-a );
R - Erosion factors of mean rainfall;
51



Environmental Impact Statement for Laoyemiao-Jining Highway
K -Soil erodible factors ( t / ha)
L, -Landform factors;
C -Cover and management factors;
P -Actual erosion control factors.
(2) Physical meaning and value of parameters
R stands for dynamics of hydraulic erosion related to precipitation and rainfall intensity
which can be considered unchanged before and after the highway construction; K stands for the
sensitivity of soil to erosion related to soil granularity and organic composition. When K is less
than 4, the seepage is moderate in case of topsoil. In case of lower layer of excavated topsoil, the
structures are mainly blocks and in lamellar form with K being 0.42 - 0.46.
LE stands for grade length and degree called landform factors. It can be calculated by
using the following model:
L    (  A   )m(6541sn2 0 +4.56sin9+ 0.065)                (6-2)
22.13
where: A-grade length (m ) ,the distance between start of runoff to river basin or settlement
pools;
0-angleofgroundsurface (0
m -experimental index.
Parameters mentioned above prior to, during and after construction phases and landform
factors are listed in Table 6-4.

Prior to the construction phase at plain farmland areas, P = 0.5: at waste land P = 0.6. During
the construction phase, subgrade P = 0.7, ground surface after excavation P = l.0 .

(3) Predicted levels of soil erosion intensity
To simplify the calculation, the intensity of soil erosion before the construction stage is
supposed to be A,, that during the construction A2 . so the prediction model can be simplified
as follows:
A2    R2K2LS2C2P2 _K2L2C2P2                           (6    3)
Al     RIKIL,SCIP,       KILS,C,P,
The above parameters are substituted into Model    (6-3), then, based on the current
erosion, the hydraulic erosion intensity at construction sites can be obtained. See Table 6-8.

2. Intensity prediction of wind erosion
(1) Prediction model
Wind erosion is assessed with sand amount and is calculated by using the following model:
Q = 1.I6477a x V059492 x o-4               (6-4)
where: Q-sand amount(g / cm2 * min);
a -comprehensive revision coefficient related to soil properties, vegetation and attack
angle of wind.
V -wind speed (rmns )
The wind speed in Wulancabu League is measured to be 4 - 5 m /s causing wind erosion
due to exposed sand. Wind speeds higher than 4.5 m / s each year and the total duration of wind
are listed in Table 6-9.

Environmental Impact Statement for Laoyemiao-Jining Highway
(2) Estimated intensity of wind erosion
Wind erosion occurs mainly on the ground surface. Large areas of vegetation will be
damaged during construction phase because of borrow sites, which leads to wind erosion. The
amount of input sand per square kilometer due to the excavation of borrow sites is presented in
Table 6-10. It shows that once the vegetation is damaged because of excavation of borrow sites,
under the severe climatic conditions, intensive wind erosion will occur expanding desertifacation
areas.

6. 2 ImpactAnalysis on Soil Erosion
6.2.1 Water Erosion
1. Estimated soil erosion on subgrade slopes
According to Table 6-8, subgrade slopes will result in great soil erosion. When the subgrade
is completed, the potential soil erosion is given in Table 6-1l provided that there is no protection.
Soil erosion is equal to erosion module A multiplied by soil area S. See Table 6-1.

Erosion per km (tlkm. a)     59.44          223.53            282.970
2. Impact Analysis on Soil Erosion on Subgrade Slopes
(I) Impact analysis in plain light rolling areas (Sections like Shangsanhaodi)
O1) Damage to farmland is resulted from penetration of large amount of sand into it.
(® Crop-producing power is reduced because of large amount of sand mud coming into the
field.
®  Ecological environment is affected by mud and sand from subgrade slope silting up in
flat areas expanding desertification area.
(2) Impact analysis in river basins (Bawang River and Niuming River)
During rainstorms, great amount of mud and sand together with runoff flows into hilly
gullies, silting up river courses. As a result, floods occur, threatening people's life and properties.
Subgrade without protection works would be washed away causing damage to the subgrade
itself. Therefore, very effective protective works will be provided to protect the subgrade of
Laoyemiao to Jining Highway.
3. Impact analysis on soil erosion at borrow sites
Table 6-8 shows that when the borrow sites are cleared up and leveled, hydraulic erosion
will very slight causing no notable effects on surface runoff and ecological environment. Its
protection measures are considered together with anti-wind erosion measures.

According to Table 6-10 and the borrow amount at different sections, the amount of input
sand and areas of borrow sites are presented in Table 6-12. It is seen that the potential amount of
input sand because of damage to vegetation is estimated to be 65090 tons each year. The depth of
wind erosion is expected to be 2.60-3.60 cm with Xinghe County in particular.

2. Impact analysis on wind erosion
Once the vegetation along the borrow sites is destroyed, they soon become the sources of
input sand, and as a result, the zonal soil erosion and desertification occur.
6.3 Mitigation Measures (Control of Soil Erosion)

1. Policy and regulations:
(1) Water and Soil Conservancy Law of PRC
(2) Technical Specifications for Water and Soil Conservancy Developments issued by
Ministry of Water Conservancy (SL204-98 )
(3) Design Specifications for Road Subgrade by MOC (JTJO13-95X)
(4) Project Feasibility Study Report
2. Protection targets
( I ) Minimum damage to water and soil conservancy facilities and compensation if any.
(2) Proper disposal of waste of earth and stone.
(3 ) No hidden perils of slide and collapse
(4) Topsoil restored and exposed surface covered with vegetation.
(5) Engineering measures against soil erosion put forward
6.3.2 Mitigation Measures against Hydraulic Erosion
1. Subgrade protection works
Reliable subgrade protection works have been designed for the project. For their number,
see Table 6-13.
Short introduction to protection works:
( I ) Protection of fill embankment
(D When the subgrade is 4m, the slope is protected with plantation of grasses. Bushes
and arbor trees are planted at toe to the border of right-of-way. See Figure 6-1.
(  When the subgrade is 4-5m,the slope is protected by using slurry schist and/or
plantation of grasses. See Figure 6-1
) When the subgrade is>5m,mortar schist retaining wall is placed below 1/2 or 1/3 of the
slope.
(0When the subgrade is >6m, below 6m, slurry schist slope is used. See Figure 6-1.
(©) At the vicissitudinous section in width and depth of the river (K277+500), T-type
dams are built to slow down water speed. See Figure 6-1.
( At partial sections of sand and wind erosion, gentle slope is used, and on it grasses are
55



Environmental Impact Statement for Laoyemiao-Jining Highway
planted and sand barriers are built. The cut slope is 1: 2-1: 3. See Figure 6-2.
(2) Subgrade protection of cutting
1. When the cut is A3m deep, earth slopes will be planted with grasses.
2. When the cut is 3-5m, earth slopes will be protected with mortar arches in diamond
shape, in which grasses are planted. See Figure 6-3. In case of weathered rocks, the slope will be
gentle to prevent rocks from falling
3. When the cut is) 12m, terraced slopes are adopted, the platform being 1.5m-2.Om wide
with the height difference of 6m-10m. At the lowest part, masonry pitching of slope is used.
4. In case of weathered rocks, facing walls are used to prevent rocks from falling. See
Figure 6-3.

3. Highway Greening
Highway greening involves slope grass plantation, greening of toe, border, interchanges and
median dividers. Greening is also a means of water and soil conservancy. The amount of greening
within right-of-way is presented in Table 5-6. Considering water and soil conservancy,
requirements of highway greening are as follows:
( 1 ) Within the right-of-way all areas except pavement and other permanent structures
will be planted with trees and grasses.
(2) Site-specific species will be chosen for plantation. Suitable species are poplar, elm,
willow and some other arbors. Some other plants that have properties to conserve water and soil
will also be planted.
6.3.3 Control Measures against Wind Erosion
Wind erosion occurs mainly at borrow sites. See Table 6-10. Besides, vegetation damage
during construction phase should also receive special attention. The following are the mitigative
measures against wind erosion:
1. Land control
( I )  Borrow area should be located at centralized sites.
(2)    The slope of cut should be gentle enough to avoid soil erosion.
(3)    On completion of the project, temporary land should be cleared     up for
rehabilitation
2. Measures against desertification of soil
The 16 borrow sites are proposed to be located at hilly areas. Owing to the fact that it is very
fry and windy, it is difficult to restore vegetation in a short time after excavation for borrow. See
Table 6-2. Therefore, the following measures are expected to take to prevent soil desertification:
( I ) Straw squares will be placed. After clearing up, borrow sites and other temporary
sites will be placed with straw squares to stop deserticating at these areas because of wind erosion.
(2) Grasses will be planted. In straw squares grass seeds will be sown that resist drought,
tolerate poor and barren soil and resist wind.
6.3.4 Estimated Cost for Water and Soil Conservancy Plans

6.3.5 Implementation Management of Water and Soil Conservancy Plans
1. Management Measures
The Freeway Company ( High-speed Highway Headquarter) and its branch agencies of
Inner Mongolia are responsible for the implementation of the plans. Their responsibilities are: to
have the construction drawings designed; to identify design requirements in tender as contract; to
strengthen monitoring and supervision in construction management. Environmental personnel and
technicians will participate in acceptance. In operation, full-time staff will be in charge of water
and soil conservancy in routine and maintenance work.
2. Technical measures
( I ) Traits of technicians and their awareness of environmental protection will be
integrated in inviting tender.
(2) The construction supervisors should know their jobs very well in water and soil
conservancy.
(3) Both the employers and contractors will set aside enough funding for personnel
training, monitoring and investigation
6.4 Summary
Enough protection works and complete drainage works will be installed for the embankment
of Laoyemiao to Jining Highway. To meet the requirements in this statement, the subgrade
protection design of sections of week geology  (K3 1 9-K325) will be paid particular attention.
On completion of the project, greening should be done within the highway right-of-way, at borrow
sites and other temporary sites for restoration of vegetation including reclamation and
rehabilitation. By doing so, the erosion resulting from construction can be reduced by 50-60%.
In 3-5 years of operation, the erosion intensity will be restored to the original levels due to the
greening project and complete facilities. As time passes by, the vegetation along the route will
grow healthily and densely, thus the erosion will be alleviated greatly. As a result, the ecological
environment will be improved.
Based on the above analysis, we can conclude that the project will not have any
uncontrollable environmental problems of soil erosion on condition that all mentioned protection
works are implemented as required. Therefore, the project is viable in terms of environmental
protection.

7 ANALYSIS ONSOCLALECONOMY, MITIGATION
MEASURES AND SUGGESTIONS
7. 1 Finance Assessment
According to the data in the project feasibility study report, the EIRR of the project is
19.61%; ERCR is 2.41 and the financial recovery period is 15.09 years. This shows that the
project is feasible financially because of substantial economic benefits.
Through analysis of sensitivity in economics, even under the condition that the operation
cost is increased by 10% and benefit is decreased by 20%, the project still has remarkable
cost/benefit capacity.
7. 2 Prediction Analysis on Socio-Economics
7.2.1 Prediction of Economic Developments in the Study Area
Based on the predicted growth of GDP in the study area, the estimated GDP in the impacted
areas is listed in Table 7-1. The data show that the construction of the highway will encourage the

7.2.2 Significant Role of the Project to the Economic Growth in Inner Mongolia
1. It will promote nationality unity and keep social stability.
Inner Mongolia is a region inhabited by many nationalities with Mongolians in the lead.
There are some other nationalities: Han, Man, Hui, Dawuer, Erlunchun, Koreans, Xibo, Tujia,
Dongxiang and Miao. Mongolians make up 15.6% of the total population and Han--78.94%. The
remainders account for about 5.46%.
To meet the requirements of the 9' 5-year plan and the planning for the year of 2010
approved by the National People's Congress, the differences between the remote areas and the
developed areas in economics must be reduced by offering assistance to the minority districts and
poor areas. Therefore, the construction of the projected highway will do a great contribution to
fulfillment of this strategy.
2. It will give full play to economic advantages of Hohhot.
The City of Hohhot is the capital of Inner Mongolia. It is 490 km from Beijing and 700km
from Tianjin Harbor. It is 400 km from the first class transport port Erlianhot, 120 km from
Zhunger Coal Field and 150 km from the City of Baotuo called Iron Capital. It together with
Baotou and Yikezhao League forms a "Gold Triangle" with rich resources. The construction of the
proposed project will certainly have great importance in speeding up opening of Hohhot and
64



Environmental Impact Statement for Laoyemiao-Jining Highway
stimulating the economic growth in the northern-westem part of China.
3. The construction of the project is an important act to implement the highway
configuration of Inner Mongolia.
The main highway frame consisting of "3 north-south, 9 east-west and 12 exits" will be
built under planning. The highway network will play an important role in developing the economy
in Inner Mongolia It intersects National Roads 208, 209, 210 and is connected to National Road
109. It is also connected with provincial roads SIOI(original 0521), S208(original 0518),
S209(original 0519), S304 original 0513), S305(original 0516), etc., forming a highway network
extending in all directions. See Figure 7-1.
4. The construction of the highway is advantageous to the growth of social economy in the
areas along the route.
The proposed alignment lies in the center of Wulanchabu League where there are the
poorest areas in the country receiving assistance. The City of Jining and Xinghe County the route
passes through are with weak infrastructures and poor natural and living conditions. See Table 7-2
for their economy. The data show that their economy is undeveloped in 89 counties or banners. So
they needs this road to speed up their backward economy urgently.

5. It is the need for implementation of the main national trunk network planning.
The highway from Laoyemiao to Hohot is one section of the national artery from
Dandong to Lhasa in Inner Mongolia. It is a truck line connecting North China and the
Northwest of China. It is also one of the most important passageways to the outside. Its
construction will definitely promote the formation of economic zones in both the central cities
and areas along the proposed project, promoting the economical boom and investment
environment in these areas. It will play a substantially important role in exploitation of resources
and transport of agricultural and husbandry products in the central and western parts in Inner
Mongolia. In addition, the construction of the alignment will speed up the passage capacity of
the national artery highways, thus encouraging the highway construction and improving the
infrastructure facilities of highway in Inner Mongolia.

7. 3 Analysis on Economical Benefits in Areas along the Alignment
7.3.1 Analysis on the Economic Benefits during Construction Phase
1. Employment benefits
According to the feasibility study report, during construction period 6,246,300 person
years of employment will be in need. See Table 7-3. The estimated labor income will arrive at
about 89,247,140 yuan. 80% of the labor will be from the locality.
2. Benefits from local materials
The main building materials for the project are listed in Table 8-3. There will be about
166,732,540 yuan of financial benefit resulting from selling local materials including stones, sand,
gravel, cement and lime.
3. Benefit from earth supply
According to the study report, 540,460 m3 of earth/stone are needed for the project. See
Table 7-1. This is a substantial financial income by selling the materials.
4. Benefits from material transport
The haulage can increase local revenue.
5. Benefits from supplies
The supplies for the construction laborers will come from locally, thus increasing the
economic income of individuals or collectives.

7.3.2 Economic Benefits during Operation Phase
1. Providing Employment
Road cleaners and staff for service centers, toll stations will be retained locally, thus
increasing employment chances.
2. Speeding up circulation of commodities
The areas that the alignment passes through usually are economic developed zones. Under
the planning of the local governments, various industries will be run by individuals or state to
promote business and trade.
7.4 Cultural Relics
Based on the survey report on cultural relics along the proposed alignment areas (Annex V),
67



Environmental Impact Statement for Laoyemiao-Jining Highway
which was conducted by Inner Mongolia Institute of Cultural Relics and Archaeology in August
2001, there are no important cultural relics and cemeteries along the alignment. So, the
construction of the proposed highway will not involve issues of damage to the relics
7. 5 Effects on Tourism
Scenic attractions and historic sites 400 km within the proposed highway are: Tomb of Yuan
Emperor Genghis Khan (200 km from Hohhot), Tomb of Princess Zhaojun (20 km from Hohhot),
Yungang Rock Graves (100 km from Jining), Great Wall Badaling (300 km from Jining), urban
areas of Beijing (300 km from Jining). For their locations, see Figure 7-2. The construction of the
highway will improve the traffic to these locations to a great extent.
7. 6 Safety
7.6.1. Impacts during construction phase
It has impacts on the construction workers and the masses. As to the construction workers,
they are likely to be injured in bridge construction. In inviting tenderers in construction bridges
and big cut sections in heaving rolling areas, the tenderers will be strictly selected. Only the
qualified in all aspects can undertake the construction. Strict regulations will be followed to ensure
the safety of the workers, and it will be written in the contract.
Wardens will posted at crossing, school sections and residential area to ensure that they are
safe.
The working time must be in schedule at some blasting sections. At blasting, no vehicles and
pedestrians are allowed to cross. The neighboring villages can be subsided for their temporarily
leaving at blasting.
No crossing of pedestrians is allowed when building up bridges.
7.6.2. Impact during operation phase
The existing Laoyemiao-Jining Highway is one section of National Road 110 in Inner
Mongolia. The road class is low with steep grade. It has been streetlized at many sections leading
to frequent traffic accidents. On completion of the road, however, the traffic accidents will
decrease to a grade degree because of better road conditions and detour of the densely peopled
towns and villages. Hence the financial losses will decrease accordingly.
In 10.3, we have analyzed the risk of hazardous materials spill. It is predicted that the accident
rate of hazardous materials spill (oil, fertilizer and pesticide) on the whole alignment is 0.773
times per year (2005) being of small probability
7.7 Impacts on Social Environment and Mitigation Measures
7.7.1 Impacts of Land Acquisition on Farming and Mitigation Measures
1. Impacts of Land Acquisition
According to the feasibility study report, 7,491.28 mu of land will be acquired. Classes and
amount of land are listed in Table 2-6. It involves 1,329.38 mu of dry land (17.7%), 2,465.56 mu
of irrigated land (32.9%). The potential impact of land occupation on farming is in Table 7-4 from
which we can see that acquisition of land will not have notable effects on farming.

We know from Table 7-4 that the land occupation will not have notable impacts on the
general economy in the study area, but it will have some slight effects on the villages involved
because 655,930 kg of grains will be lost due to land requisition in these villages ( 0.04% of the
total and 2.75-3.53 kg per person).
2. Mitigation Measures of land acquisition
(1) Engineering measures
To protect farmland, the following measures will be/ have been taken:
© The alignment will avoid farmland of high yield where possible. The alignment will use
49.3% of non-farmland, 50.7% of arable land including 32.9 % of paddy field and 17.7% of low-
yield land.
©)"Shrinkage slope" will be adopted at sections of high-producing land like Sanhaodi to
reduce land use for subgrade.
(®DThe land planed for facilities such as service area, parking lots will be chosen to use dry
land or wasteland as possible.
(2) Management measures
Because the alignment lies in a corridor, about 0.05 mu of land will be lost per person. The
farmers who lose land will be reallocated with appropriate amount of farmland.
(3) Compensation for land lost
(D Compensation will be done in compliance with the local policy and regulations to
develop economy and improve living standards.
® Compensation fund will be granted to the farmers whose land is acquired.
( The farmers whose land is acquired the most will enjoy priority in labor employment.
3. Mitigation measures of permanent land use
The following measures will be taken:
(I) No paddy land or forestland will be used for storage sites or mixing sites.
(2) Topsoil will be stored for rehabilitation after construction phase.
(3) Used fallow land and wasteland will be cleared up and made loose for restoration of
vegetation to prevent soil erosion.
7.7.2 Mitigation Measures for Resettlement Impacts
The designers have made some field reconnaissance to adjust the alignment. As a result, the
alignment has already avoided the urban areas of Jining and Xinghe Town sites and other towns
and villages. An area of 3315 m2 (about 166 rooms) is expected to be demolished. See Table 7-5.
Due to the backward economy, the housing is in very bad conditions. See Figure 7-3 for detail.
Most the residents have strong wish to resettle although most of them have their own shelters.
However, demolition of housing and resettlement do have some adverse impacts. So the following
measures will be taken to reduce the impacts to a minimum.

1. Compensation for demolition and resettlement
The local policy regarding houising demolition and resettlement will be carried out strictly
and the compensation funding will be granted to those themselves whose houses are demolished
without using for other puirposes.
2. Resettlement management
(I) Resettlement will be conducted under the management of the l ocal governments in such
a way to occupy as less farmnland as possible. The new houses will be built in the areas where the
noise levels at night are less than 50 dB.
(2) Resettlement should be implemented prior to commencement of the proj'ect itself The
new houses will be improved to some extent compared to the current ones. Support will be given
to those who have difficulties in building new houses.
(3) As minority nationalities are concerned in resettlement their customs and religion should
be respected.
7.7.3 Mitigation Measures against Traffic Disruption
The width of the proposed highway is 27.5 m.~ It is a fully enclosed expressway. With a view
to providin the local people with convenient traffic, initersection works and enou-gh transverse
passageways have been designed. See Table 7-6. Eight passageways are provided per 10 km on
the average. 'The F'igure is less than the atveraige level of China due to the population
density of this region along the proposed highway was less than the average of other
Chinese region and much less than thadt of the de-vclopcd areas of' China. TIhe
distribution of the passageways varies in terms of the population density along the
proposed road (see Figure 7-4). Four passageways have been added in the project
according to public consultation and survey. Finally, the, number of the passageways
has heen increased from 74 to 78.

7.7.4 Mitigation Measures of Impacts on Water Conservancy Facilities
The proposed alignment passes through Bawang River, Niuning River and lots of gullies.
The construction of the highway will cause disturbances to the rvers and channels along the road.
Therefore, mitigation measures will be taken in design of the project.
1. Engineering measures
To ensure smooth flow of irrigation channels as well runoff, enough culverts have been
designed. See Sections 2,4,3. There are 2.01 culverts per km which are sufficient for the area
where the annual rainfall is less than 400 mm.
2. Measures during construction phase
(1) To protect irrigation channels and prevent soil erosion, the construction/reconstruction
work of irrigation chanmels should be done in dry and slack seasons.
(2) Small and culverts should be built in dry seasons.
(3) Mud and sand coming from construction of large and middle-sized bridges are not
allowed to dump into river courses, floodplains or banks of channels.
(4)When construction access roads cause disturbances to irrigation channels, temporary
bridges and culverts will be built to guarantee smooth runoff.
7.7.5 Mitigation Measures of Impacts on Local Roads
The following measures will be taken during the construction phase to alleviate impacts on
local roads:
Prior to commencement of the construction, the local roads used for transport of building
materials will be improved or new construction access roads be built.
1. The local roads damaged in transporting materials should be repaired as properly after the
construction or compensated for the damage in terns of money.
2. New access roads will be built to connect existing roads in case of partial disruption.
3. Transport vehicles should avoid peak hours of the local roads to reduce noise, air pollution
and traffic accidents.
7.7.6 Mitigation Measures of Impacts on Safety
1. To reduce traffic accidents, the materials transport vehicles will avoid rush hours.
2. At each bit section a flag person for safety will be posted. At night signal lights should be
installed. No villagers, pedestrians or animals allowed enter construction sites
7.8 Impacts of Borrow Sites, Materials Transport and Mitigation
Measures during Construction Phase
7.8.1 Impacts of Borrow Site and Mitigative Measures
72



Environmental Impact Statement for Laoyemiao-Jining Highway
I .Quarries
The study area is rich in stones in hilly locations. See Table 2-7. Producing stones is one of
the local financial resources.
2. Sites for sand and gravel
There are 13 sites for sand and gravel distributed on the floodplaims or hilly locations. See
Figure 2-4. Excavation of sand in a controllable way is good for discharge of floods.
3. Borrow sites
As Table 6-2 shows there are 16 borrow sites. The impacts resulting from borrow sites are
presented in Chapters 5 and 6.
7.8.2 Impacts of Materials Transport on Environment and Mitigation Measures
1. Major transport roads
As Table 7-3 demonstrates the materials like timber, steel and cement are purchased locally
and hauled through the mountainous roads or the existing Laoyemiao to Jining Highway. Asphalt
comes from Hohhot and Jining through the existing Laoyemiao to Jining Highway. Sand, gravel,
and stones are hauled through local roads or access roads.
2. Impacts of materials transport on environment
(I) Prediction of traffic volume
The traffic volume of the materials transport vehicles is estimated to be 1,722,600 including
1,389,200 through local roads for sand and gravel and 336,700 through the existing Laoyemiao to
Jining Highway. It is calculated on the basis that the construction period lasts for 4 years and about
2 years of busy haulage of materials and 300 days of working and 10 hours a day. Then the traffic
volume of short distances a day is 219.69. Supposing that there are 7 bit sections, the volume of
each section is estimated to be 34.7. The traffic volume for timber, and asphalt through the
existing highway is expected to be 28.6 per hour.
(2) Impacts on environment
(DNoise: Materials haulage during construction period will not have notable impacts on
environment due to the fact that there less traffic.
(M) Air pollution: Chapter 8 shows that the vehicular exhaust gases will not have obvious
impacts on ambient air quality. However, the fugitive dust resulting from traffic will have impacts
on sensitive locations nearby.
3. Mitigation measures
They are mentioned in Section 7.4 of Chapter 7.
7. 9 Summary
1. The construction of Laoyemiao to Jining highway is necessary for implementation of the
national highway networks and skeleton configuration of Inner Mongolian highway networks. It is
an important act in transferring economy development to the West of the country. It is also an
important move to improving the infrastructure in Inner Mongolia.
2. The construction of the highway has advantageous financial benefits.
3. The construction of the project has very good socio-economic benefits playing an
important role in the general development planning in Inner Mongolia. It is also a "poverty-
assistance project" in western-central part of Inner Mongolia.
4. The projected highway will have remarkable economical benefits in the involved areas
during operation phase promoting various industries like business, trade, agriculture and
73

husbandry.
5. The transport and traffic facilities will be greatly improved for the public and it will also
encourage tourism in Westem-central Inner Mongolia, Beijing and Shanxi Province..
6. 3794.94 mu of farmland will be acquired accounting for 50.7% of the total including
32.9 % of paddy land and 17.7 % of low-producing dry land. The alignment layout of the route is
rational by detouring towns and major villages. Compensation for the lost fields and houses will
be conducted in view of not to reducing the living standards of the presidents.
7. Sufficient measures to protect irrigation facilities, surface water regime and local
highway networks will be taken. The convenient traffic for the public and production of
agriculture and husbandry will also be provided.
8. The impacts on the living environment during both construction and operation phases
will be minimized with engineering measwes, economic compensation and management.
Based on the analysis of impacts on social environment, we can conclude that the
construction of the project will play a very substantial role in promoting the local economy growth.
It is also a project to help the poorest areas to get rid of poverty in compliance with the policy of
the country at present. The positive (advantageous) impacts of the project are more than the
adverse (negative). It can be concluded that the project is feasible from the viewpoint of economy
and environmental protection.

Based on the meteorological data from the weather stations of Xinghe and Jining, we
calculated the frequency of occurrence of the stability classes along the route. See Fig 8-3. It
shows that the highest frequency (47.5-61.4%) is the neutral climate (stability of D class) with the
stable weather (E-F classes) taking the second place (20.1-33.0%), and with slightly unstable and
unstable conditions (C and A-B) being least (2.2-15.92% and 3.4-16.5%)

8. 2. 3 Concentration Prediction of CO and NO,
On the basis of the traffic volume, landform and weather conditions, the average daily
concentrations of CO and NO2 in 2005, 2010, 2015 and 2025 is predicted at Gaomiaozi and
Beiyintala cross sections. The background concentration values for superposition are 5-day
average. Fig. 8-4 and Fig.8-5 show the daily average concentrations of CO and NO2 at different
sections under typical weather conditions in different predicting years, respectively. In addition,
concentrations of CO and NO2 at air sensitive spots during operation period are listed in Table 8-2.

1. We can see from Fig.8-4 and Table 8-2 that the average daily concentrations of CO at two
cross sections (or four sensitive spots ) do not exceed national ambient air quality standard GB
3095-96 (4.00 mg/m3).
2. According to Fig. 8-5 and Table 8-2, the average daily concentrations of NO2 do not
exceed the class 11 standards of GB3095-96( 0.10mglm3).
Therefore, we can come to the conclusion that in the operation phase, the proposed highway
will not affect the air quality along the line.

8.3 Environmental ImpactAnalysis of Construction Dust
Dust coming from earth and lime mixing sites and machinery contributes to air pollution
during construction. It pollutes the air to a great extent.
Monitoring of TSP shows that at 50 m from the earth and lime mixing sites, the TSP are as
high as 1.00 mg/in3; at 100 m apart from earth and mixing stations near storage sites the TSP are
1.65 mg/m3; at 150m they are 1.00 mg/m3.
TSP is resulted mainly from the secondary dust of transport vehicles. To prevent dust, water
will be sprayed.
8. 4 Air Pollution Mitigation Measures
1. The material storage sites and earth and limestone mixing sites will be located in open
areas 200 m from residential areas or schools. Construction material storage sites, assess roads and
road section near village or schools will be sprayed with water regularly.
2. Fugitive dust control measures
The construction sites and major hauling roads will be sprayed regularly (two times a day, in
the morning and afternoon) to prevent dust.
3.   Asphalt fume control measures
Asphalt mixing sites will selected properly and will located at least 500 m from residential
areas on the down wind direction of the wind directions. Besides, in the asphalt cooking process,
open or semi-enclosure techniques will be allowed absolutely.
To sum up, due to larger wind speed along the road, the construction of Laoyemiao- Jining
Highway has not some obvious impacts on the ambient air quality, from the viewpoint of
environmental air protection, the construction of the highway feasible.

9 PREDICTION OFIMPACTS ON WATERAHD
MITIGATION MEASURES
The alignment cuts theYmzi river, Niuming river, Toudao river and Bawang river vertically.
The Bawang River is recommended as water resources to be protected by WWF. The Bawang
river, Niuming river and Toudao river flow into the Huangqi Lake, which is recognized as an
important source of water for surrounded areas by IUCN. Four rivers are identified as
environmentally sensitive spots.
The major potential contributors to water environment are the cumulated pollutants on
bridge surfaces. These pollutants flow with rainwater causing pollution to rivers. Besides, the
sewage from administrative sections and service centers and wastewater containing oil also
contributes to water pollution. However, during construction phase, pollutants of water are mainly
from domestic sewage from construction campus.
9.1 Prediction of Impacts on Water during Operation Phase and
Mitigation Measures
9.1.1 Prediction of Pollution of Bridge Surface Runoff
Considering the features and water functions of rivers (Section 3.1.4), the Yinzi River and
the Bawang River are chosen as basis to predict potential pollution of bridge surface runoff
downstream.
1. Bridge surface runoff pollution sources
(I) Pollutant concentrations of bridge surface rainstorm
Obtained from monitoring results and available data, the concentrations are identified as in
Table 9-1.
Table 9-1 Contaminant Concentration of Runoff on Bridge Pavement

(2) Runoff of bridge surface rainstorm
The mean annual precipitation in the study area is 365-404 mm with a maximum daily
rainfall of 78 mm. Based on the route alignment, topographical features and relevant locations to
the rivers, the runoff is determined as in Table 9-2

2. Pollution prediction of road pavement runoff
Pollution concentration of surface initial rainstorm is predicted with a complete hybrid
model:

Note: COD.,: COD%A. is calculated using 1: 0.6; the flow of the Yinzi River is 3 m3is; the flow of the
Bawang River is 5 m3/s; 
From the calculated results we know that during the operation of the highway, the bridge
surface rainstorm has less impacts on water quality, and the effects cease as the rainstorm cease.
9.1.2 Impacts of Sewage from Service Centers
According to the feasibility study report, there are two service centers which locate at
Xinghe and Jining Section, respectively. For the locations and land use, refer to Table 9-4. The
pollution source intensity is estimated as below:
Table 9-4      Location  and Scale of the Service Center
No.        Names               Stations         Area (iM2)           Notes
YXinghe Center        K309+ 170-K309+430       20010X2     Symmetrically on either
side
2       Jining Center  K354+200-K354+500        26680X2      Symmetrically on either
side
1. Assuming that a service building containing shopping centers, restaurants and hotels are
built, it will be staffed with 35 management staff and 25 other service workers at parking lots,
garages and filling stations. Another 300 passengers and drivers will stay for rest or for the nigh.
Provided that each person consumes 1 50L of water, then the mean daily sewage will be 540 m3.
Given that COD concentrations is 500 mg/I, BOD5concentrations is 220 mg/l and oil
concentrations is 100 mg/I, then the pollution source strength is: COD=27 kg/d, BOD,=l 1.88
kg/d, oil=5.4 kg/d.
2. According to the traffic volume in the mid-term of operation (2010), 360 vehicles need
washing (2% of the total), the car-washing wastewater will be 43.2 m3/d, then the pollution source
strength will be: COD-8.64 kg/d; BOD5=l .94 kg/d, oil=1.30 kg/d.
3. The pollution source strength of filling stations and garages will be COD=0 kg/d,
BOD5=2.5 kg/d, oil=2.0 kg/d, if they are cleaned with water once a day.
Therefore, the water pollution source intensity from service center is:
COD=45.64 kg/d, BOD5=16.32 kg/d, oil=8.7 kg/d.
84



Environmental Impact Statement for Laoyemiao-Jining Highway
For this reason, the sewage from service centers can not be discharged until treated
appropriately It is suggested that a comprehensive sewage treatment device be installed to
dispose of domestic sewage and wastewater containing oil in keeping with 3 class of " Integrated
Discharge Standard for Sewage" GB8978-1996, which is requested by EPE of Inmer Mongolia.
See Appendix 2. After treated. It can be used for irigation.
9.2 Prediction of Water Pollution and Mitigation during Construction
The potential impacts of bridge construction on water quality of rivers will be reflected in the
following aspects:
I. Turbid waters resulting from bndge construction may affect water quality in rivers.
2. Oil leaked from bridge construction machinery may come into rivers causing water
pollution.
3. Construction materials like bitumen, oil and chemicals may be washed away into rivers
leading to pollution.
4. The domestic sewage of the construction workers and garbage may be discharged into
rivers contributing to pollution without proper management.
To alleviate the four possible kinds of impacts on the water quality of rivers and the
Huangqi Lake, the following mitigation measures are suggested:
( I )To stop bridge construction pollution, some up-to-date techniques may be adopted such
as sinking drum methods and cofferdam method which are suitable for the particular conditions of
these rivers in the study area.
(2) Wastewater containing oil will not be allowed to discharge into rivers before treated in
a proper way.
(3) The storage sites of building materials of asphalt, oil and chemicals will be far away
from river banks and muffled.
(4) The sewage of construction campus ( about 20 m3 a day) which is one of the pollution
source of water should be treated centrally. Feces, when composted, can be used as manure.
With the above measures taken, the bridge construction will not bring about notable effects
on water quality of the rivers.
9.3   RiskAnalysis ofAccidentSpills of Hazardous Materials
It is unavoidable to transport hazardous goods on the highway when in operation. It is very
important to avoid accidental spills of hazardous materials because Yinzi River through which the
alignment passes and the upper part of Yongding River that passes though Hebei and Beijing. The
risk of hazardous materials spills analyzed as below:
The probability of traffic accidents of the vehicles hauling hazardous chemicals is computed
using the following model:
5
p = JJQi = Q,xQ2xQ3 xQ5 xQ6                   (9-2)
i=l
where: P -Probability of risk accidents occurs in the section along the water bodies in the
predicted years
Q, -Existing probability of severe accidents in the area along the proposed highway

Q4 -Ratio of trucks to total traffic volume, ( % );
Q5 -Ratio of the trucks carrying hazardous chemicals to total truck volume ( %);
Q6 -Length of road section along the river (km)
The value of parameters in the model:
Q, -With reference of the probability of the traffic accidents in Inner Mongolia
Ql = 0.2 times/million vehicles/kIn);
Q2 -According to the predicted traffic volume , the value in 2005 is 2.65 million vehicles
/a, in 2010 it is 3.86 million vehicles /a, and in 2020, 7.75 million vehicles /a;
Q3 -Based on the American Traffic Safety Report (1974), the accident rate of expressway
is 75% of that of ordinary highway, Q3 =25%,
Q4 -According to OD Survey of the feasibility study report, Q4 = 60%:
Q5 -According to OD Survey of the feasibility study report, the ratio of vehicles hauling
oil and fertilizer and pesticide make up 4.5% of the total number of trucks running on the road.
Q6 -Depends on the length of the river crossed, Q6 =3.3km.
The results of computation are in Table 9-5.
Table 9-5 shows that the accident rate of vehicles carrying hazardous materials is
relatively low. The accidents however, may happen. Therefore, preventive measures seem to be
very important.

9. 4 EP Measures against Water Pollution
1. Cofferdam dams will use in construction to avoid turbid water flowing into Bawang
river, Yinzi river Toudao river and Niuming River. Mud and waste materials of the construction
activities will not be discharged into these rivers. Temporary settlement tanks will be dug.
86

2. Wastewater of construction machinery, when cached, will be treated properly before
charged into rivers.
3. Toxic materials like asphalt, oil and chemicals will be stored outside of river bed and
muffled. -
4. Sewage of the construction campus will be treated centrally; feces will be used as manure
after proper treatment.
5. The sewage of service centers will be treated by using septic tanks; car washing water
will be recycled for reuse and will meet 3 class standards of "General Sewage Discharge
Standards" GB8978-1996. See Figure 9-1.
DomSstcc
Figure 9-1 Flow Chart of Sewage Treatment
6. Domestic sewage at 2 service centers plus tolling stations will be treated by using septic
tanks and after treated used as manure for fanming. Otherwise it can not be discharged into rivers.
7. Toll stations can also take responsibilities of traffic control to stop vehicles with spills
and overload running on the road.
8. The administrative departments will be informed of vehicles hauling hazardous materials
and they can not run on the road unless get permits. Such vehicles should be provided with
obvious markings and can not stop wherever they want.
9. In case of accidental spill of hazardous materials, the relevant departnents will be
immediately informed to take prompt actions based on the emergency plan.

10 ALTERNATIVES
This chapter has been worked out through careful discussion with the designers.
According to "Project Feasibility Study Report", there are three comparison schemes, e.g.
Option I, II and III. For more details, see Fig.1 0-1. Scheme I and scheme II are the same route
alignment except for the different width and different construction stage. The route alignments of
the scheme I and scheme IIn also are near to each other. The environmental situations and
topographical conditions along three aligmnents are quite the same.
10.1 Comparison between Build-Option and No-Build Option
There is an existing highway between Laoyemiao to fining, namely National Road 110.
However, the class of existing highway is two leading to frequent traffic accidents due to low
technical standards, more heavy truck on the road and other unfavorable conditions. Meanwhile, the
existing highway does not meet the need to implement the state's main framework of National
Trunk Highway System (NTHS). With the increase of traffic volume in the future, low traffic
capacity of the existing highway is not in conformity with the requirement for carrying out the State
Strategy of Massive Development of the West. As to noise and vehicle exhausted gases (CO, NO2)
in the operation phase, zero alternative would be worse than the proposal alternative. The
advantages and disadvantages of the construction options and the zero option (not to be constructed)
are listed in Table 10-1 that show the necessity of the construction of the road.

10.2 Alignments of Alternative Schemes
From the viewpoint of engineering, the advantages and disadvantages of each alternative
schemes are analyzed.
* Alternative scheme I
Scheme I is to construct a new expressway near the existing Class 11 highway, and most of the
existing Class H highway will be used as relief road. The total length in Scheme I is 91.28 km.
Advantages: a. with great traffic capacity
a. with good indicators of horizontal and longitudinal profiles, and
b. with good construction conditions and topographical conditions.

Environmental Impact Statement for Laoyemiao-Jining Highway
Disadvantages: a high engineering cost.
*   Alternative scheme 11
Scheme 11 and Scheme I are quite the same in terms of location of the route, the route
alignment, control points and standards, except that the construction periods of the two
schemes are different. In Scheme I the full-width expressway will be completed at one time; in
Scheme II the expressway will be constructed on the location and alignment, but by with width
and by stage. Phase I of Scheme ll is to constructed a new expressway with one half -width ,
and the existing Class 11 highway will be used as another width. Phase 2 of Scheme II is to
build another half -width expressway with the existing road as relief road. The total length of
Scheme 11 is 91.28 km.
Advantages:
a. to use the existing highway to the maximum extent; and
b. small input in Phase I of the Project, hence easing the contradiction of a great
number of projects, large scale of projects and financial shortage for highway construction
projection IMAR
Disadvantages:
a. after Phase I is finished the traffic capacity is still low;
b. after Phase I is finished the mixed traffic on the existing highway cannot be solved
yet;
c. with higher total cost than Scheme l;
*   Alternative scheme III
In Scheme III both sides of the existing highway will be expanded to built a Class I highway
with four lanes. In this Scheme, the total length is 91.559 km.
Advantages:
a. with less acquired farmland and making full use of the existing highway; and
b. with the low engineering cost.
Disadvantages:
a. with great difficulty to reform the structures;
b. the indicators of the existing highway's alignment are low, some parts have 4 places
with small radius, and have big longitudinal slopes ; the technical standards of part of the sections
do not comply with the requirements for Class I highways.
c. when rehabilitation is carried out the existing normal traffic will be affected;
d. the low subgrade cannot be closed, and the mixed traffic cannot be solved with bad
safety conditions;
e. more residential houses and commercial spots will be removed;
10.3 Comparison of schemes
These Schemes are compared in terms of elements of highway technology, social development,
economy, and environment.
10.3.1 Comparison Elements of Highway Technology
*   Scheme III
The comparisons of engineering elements for each scheme is shown in Table 10-2. It can be
seen from Table 10-2 that for Scheme 111, since there exists great difficulty in rehabilitating the
90



Environmental Impact Statement for Laoyemiao-Jining Highway
existing highway, parts of which are not in conformity with the requirement for Class I highway
standard, and parts of which pass through the urban areas with difficulty in making closure and
being easy to be disturbed by mixed traffic. In addition, this Scheme has low traffic capacity and is
difficult to be adaptable to the need of the perspective traffic volume.
*    Scheme II
In Scheme It the project will be constructed by stages, with both the total cost and construction
period to be increased and causing difficulty and management.
*     Scheme I
Through the comprehensive analyses on the above factors, Scheme I is adaptable to the need
for the perspective traffic, and the evaluation shows that this scheme can make the maximum
contributions to the national economy and have good profitability capability. Therefore, this
feasibility study selects Scheme I (i.e. to newly build a full-width expressway) as the Recommended
Scheme.

10.3.2 Comparison of Environmental Elements
I Ecological Environment
*    Soil erosion
Because the Scheme I and the Scheme II are the exactly same route alignment, and the scheme I
and Scheme Ill are near to each other, the natural environment, topographical and earth work
amount are basically the same. So we can conclude that there is no obvious difference between soil
erosion amount caused by scheme I and that by scheme Ill.
*    Land Acquisition
91



Environmental Impact Statement for Laoyemiao-Jining Highway
Scheme I will occupy 8,985.8 mu of land. Scheme II1 will occupy 4118.1 mu of land. Impact of
land use of scheme II1 is less than that of scheme 1.
*    Removed Buildings
The demolition area of Scheme I is 3315 m2. The removed area of scheme III is 7230 m3.
Removed area of scheme III is more than that scheme I. In addition, survey shows that another 13
houses will be removed by scheme III.
2.   Noise
Scheme I: In the year of 2025 in operation phase, the noise level in 3 villages will exceed the
standard (at night); However, Scheme III: 6 villages will exceed the standard. So, from the angle of
noise impact, Scheme I is superior to Scheme lII.
3. Water
There is no great difference of impact on water because of the basically same traffic volume
and the samne number of management and service centers.
4.   Social development
There is no great difference of impact on social development because of the basically same
traffic volume and the same number of grade separations.
5.   Ambient air
There is no great difference of impacts on the air because of the same traffic volume and
meteorological conditions.
6.   Safety
Scheme I is superior to scheme III for the following reason: Scheme III will upgrade existing
highway to become a Class I highway with four lanes. The indicators of the existing highway's
alignment are low; Some parts have 4 places with small radius, and have big longitudinal slopes;
The technical standards of part of the sections do not comply with the requirements for Class I
highways. the low subgrade cannot be closed, and the mixed traffic cannot be solved with bad safety
conditions;
So, we can make conclusion that from the viewpoint of comprehensive environmental impact,
scheme I is superior to scheme III.
10.33 Micro level Scheme alternatives
Four micro level alternatives at the sections of Xinghe, Jiabazi, Niuming village and xiao nao
were analyzed during the designing of actual alignment from the viewpoints of environmental
protection. The results of the environmental comparisons are shown in Figure 1 0-2(a-d).
10.4 Conclusion of comparison
I. Build-scheme is superior to No-Build scheme in terms of environmental protection.
2. Comparison of schemes I and scheme III is as follows:
On the basis of comprehensive comparison in diverse aspects, our EIA statement recommends
scheme I to comply with the recommended scheme of the report of project feasibility study.

Figure 10-2 Micro level Scheme alternatives
1. Schemes for section in Xinghe County
The existing road is situated in the south of the County, 2 km far from the County. The
proposed highway can be either located between the existing road and the County (Scheme B) or
situated in the south part of the existing road (Scheme A) (see FigurelO-2a). For environmental
considerations, Scheme B is close to the Xinghe County so as to affect the future development of
the County in land. Meantime, it is so close to the resident area as to bring both noise and exhaust
impacts to the resident by vehicles. Also, Scheme B would occupy much fannland. For Scheme A,
however, it keeps away from the resident area avoiding the impact on the resident by noise and
exhaust as well as is beneficial to the development of the County. Furthermore, Scheme A mainly
would occupy wasteland. From the viewpoint of environmental protection, Scheme A would be
adopted.

2. Schemes for section in Jiabazi (K320)
Jiabazi section is across hills which take the shape of "V" in terrain and the existing road is
located at the bottom of the "V". Three Schemes: A, B and C, can be used in this section as shown
in FigurelO-2b. Schemes A and C would require to be situated at the hillside; Although the
alignment is good, in construction, it would be required to explode the hill with deep cut and high
filL which would lead to serious soil erosion. From standpoints of environmental protection and
decreasing soil erosion, Scheme B would be finalized, i.e. using the existing road locally so as to
diminish the land acquisition. In the meantime, soil erosion would be avoided resulting from the
deep cut and high fill.

3. Schemes for section in Xiaonao (K330)
Three Schemes A, B and C, are under consideration for section in Xiaonao (see
FigurelO-2c). If Scheme A were used, it would influence the Xiaonao Pond. Drought occurs
locally and surface water is very rare. Therefore, in order to protect the water resources of the
Xiaonao Pond, Scheme A is denied. Scheme C would widen the existing road. Though the amount
of works is small, it is so close to the Village of Jiajia and occupies a lot of irrigated farmland.
Consequently, Scheme C is vetoed too. In order to aviod the impact on the Xiaonao and decrease
acquisition of irrigated farmland, the proposed road would be located at the hillside and near rto
the existing road. Therefore, Scheme B is finalized as recommendation.

4. Schemes for section in Niuming Village (K340)
Three Schemes A, B and C, for section under the proposed road close to the Village of
Niuminmg have been done. Scheme A would use the existing road with less quantity of works and
less land acquisition. However, it would be so close to the Village of Niuming that noise and
exhaust by vehicles would heavily impact on the local resident. For Scheme B, it would be newly
built to the south of the Village of Ertaigou. This Scheme has better alignment with low cost of
works. However, it would occupy more irrigated farmland and cut a large number of trees. As for
Scheme C, it would also be a new road in the south of the Niuming Village with moderate
indicators in aligmnent and use most of the waste land. The Scheme C has plenty of structures
with a long distance of transportation of principal building materials. For environmental
considerations, however, Scheme C would be recommended.

Environmental Impact Statement for Laoyemiao-Jining Highway
I I PUBLIC PARTICIPATION
11.1 Scope and Ways of Public Participation
In November 1998 and June 1999, after environmental screening and before the TOR for the
EA are finalized, the EA panel from Xian Highway University conducted two time social and public
consultations in Jining City, Xinhe County, Gaomiaozi town and Beiyintal town. Hearings into the
comments from the masses along the road, more than 39 people who are interested the project were
convened. In addition, the EA pane also consulted 27 persons from the following departments: local
agriculture, forestry, water conservancy and communications, hearing into the comments about
potential environmental impact caused by the project.
In August 2001, third public consultations was conducted at Caoci'yao village's Cattle
Breeding Association (a local NGO), Badaqing village and Shangsanhaodi village to collect more
opinions of the affected groups and local NGOs . 38 persons had attended the consultation meetings.
In addition, 142 of information kits were handed out with 121 collected. Some Selections can
be seen in Annex V.
11.2 Publicizing and Information Disclosure
In the end of November 1998, draft TOR of EIA was published in Jining City, Xinhe County,
Gaomiaozi town and Beiyintal town villages. The TOR has such contents as: 1) highway location; 2)
possible noise impact; 3) possible impact from separation; 4) possible influence from land taking etc.
The publicizing was carried out by two methods as door by door introduction and material sending.
All the participants gave out their opinions actively, which shows a positive attitude to the highway
construction as well as a great concern on land taking compensations.
In the end of July 1999, on the basis of the initial draft of the EIA, the EIA term had made
public consultation by face-to-face talks with 18 persons at Beryintala town, Gaomiaozi Village and
Dagong Primary School. the draft EA report contains the following: 1) adverse impacts of the
highway; 2) EP measures to be taken; 3) public views on our measures. The individuals all paid
great attention to the project construction because they are closely related to their own interests.
Fig. 11-1 shows a photo of public consultation at Beiyintala town.
In August 2001, according to the EIS of the proposed highway, we conducted the third public
consultation work. Three public consultation meetings were holded at Caoci'yao village's Cattle
Breeding Association (a local NGO), Badaqing village and Shangsanhaodi village, respectively. 38
persons who are interested in the proposed project attended the meetings. (Photoll-2 show the
consultant meeting sites). At the consultation meetings, the panel provided the affected groups with
the proposed project's objectives, alignment and the EA conclusion and pointed out the major
potential impacts on environment. Through fully discussion with the representatives of local NGOs
farmers, individuals. the memorandums of consultant meetings were obtained. For details see Table
11-2, Table 11-3 and Table 11-4.
The Chinese version of the final EIA was publicized at the Wulanchabu Freeway Project
Office during Septeber 6-30,2001. Before it was publicized, an advertisement for EIA information
disclosure was put on the Wulanchabu Daily (a local newspaper) on September 6, 2001 in order to
let affected groups, local NGOs and individuals interested in the project know the public
consultations and information disclosure. At the same time, the advertisement publicized phone

Environmental Impact Statement for Laoyemiao-Jining Highway
According to Table 11-1, the opinions are summarized as follows:
(1)  95% of people are in favor of the construction of the highway.
(2) Knowing that to be rich they must build roads first, the masses believe that the
construction of the alignment is favorable to the local economic boom. 90% of the people think that
with the improvement of traffic and rapid growing economy, their living standards will be bettered
soon.
(3) About 84% of the people have no objection to land acquisition. However, there are still
some people (about 16%) who have complaints about land acquisition and resettlement due to the
fact that they no little about the policy and regulations. These people must be persuaded carefully,
and besides, in design the route should avoid their farmland and houses as much as possible.
(4) They require that the fund for compensation be granted directly to them.
(5) Most villagers suggest that more bridges be placed to reduce social disruption.
* Opinions and suggestions from local community and NGO
Jointly sponsored by the assessment team and the project office, consultant meeting with public
participation were held respectively at Badaqing Village, Caoci'yao Village, and Shangsanhaodi
Village (Yushuwan ) in August 2001. The participants and sites are as shown in Figure 11-2.
Through fully discussion with the local non-government organizations (NGOs) or representatives of
the farmers, the memorandums were obtained. The details are shown in Table 11 -2-Tablel 14
Table 11-2 A Forum Memorandum of public consultation at Caoci'yao Village's Cattle
Breeding Association (a NGO)
Place:          Caoci'yao Village
Date:           August 9, 2001
Participants:   Members of Caoci'yao Village's Cattle Breeding Association (with the
namne list attached later)
Sponsor:        Xi'an Highway University and Project Office
Memorandum:
1. Laoyemiao-Jining Expressway is a national priority project. Its construction will provide us with more
employment, and is favorable to the social and economic development along the route. All of us are in
favor of the project;
2. Our association is the largest non-govermnent cattle-breeding group along the route, with 120 members
and 520 cattle, its milk is mainly sold in Jining and Beijing. The project is favorable for us to expand our
production scale and market. However, about 2500mx60m of our land will be used by the project, the
majority of which is low-yield dry land. We agree on the government's land acquisition policy and
compensation measures and hope that timely compensation should be carried out and be distributed to us
directly. In general, the project will not cause adverse impact on us.
3. We also hope that some passages be constructed within the area under the jurisdiction of our association
so as to facilitate the life, production and communications on both sides of the highway.

Place:            Jiade's home, Badaqing Village,
Date:             August 9, 2001
Participants:     8 representatives of the villagers
Sponsor:          Xi'an Highway University and Project Office
Memorandum:
1. There are 220 villagers (50 households), 1700mu arable land (70mu irrigated land) in our village. The
villagers are mainly engaged in farming and the annual average income per capita is 500-600RMB. There
are no cultural relics and ancient remains in the village.
2. We are acquainted with the project, especially something relevant to demolition and removal. However, we
are not so well informed of the national policy on compensation of removal and resettlement. After the
symposium, we have got well acquainted with the relevant policies.
3. We are in favor of the project. We believe that the route is rational and its construction will promote the
economic growth of our village and improve our living standard.
4. The project will take up a little of our farmland, which is mainly of dry land, so the land acquisition will not
cause significant adverse impact on the agricultural production of our village.
5. 16 households in our village have to be removed due to the project. We agree on the resettlement, but hope
to get the corresponding compensation based on the national standard. As to the site of resettlement, we
hope to be removed to some nearby places.
6. The route will divide our village into two parts, so we hope that a passage is constructed so that our
villagers and domestic animals can pass through the expressway conveniently.

Date:             August 10, 2001
Participants:     Representatives of the villagers
Sponsor:          Xi'an Highway University and Project Office
Memorandum:
Shangsanhaodi Village (Yushuwan) is 4 km away from the southern suburb of Jining City A large-scaled
interchange is to be built at Shangsanhaodi Village. Now there are 700 people in the village and they are
mainly engaged in farming, with an annual income of 2800RMB per capita. There are no cultural relics and
ancient remains worth protection in the village. In the symposium, the villagers were given a brief introduction
of the environmental impact of the project and the national policies on removal and resettlement The
representatives gave their independent opinions on the project's impact on their village. The memorandum was
obtained as follows.
I. The construction of Laoyemiao-Jining expressway is favorable to the development of our village. Because
of the construction of a large-scaled interchange in our village, it will become one of the centers in the
highway network of Inner Mongolia. This will bring us a chance of development, so all of us support the
construction of this national major project and expect the construction to be started as early as possible.
2. We believe the route of the highway is rational and its construction will not cause adverse impact on the
environment.
3. The interchange will occupy a lot of land in our village. We agree on the land acquisition program of the
project and hope to be compensated according to the corresponding national policies.
4. There are no rare animals or plants on the land to be acquisitioned or in its vicinity.
August 10, 2001
* Wishes and suggestions from affected groups and masses
These wishes and suggestions are:
(1) All the local governments are in favor of the construction of the highway since it a
composition of the National Dandong to Lhasa Artery Highway.
97



Envirounental hnpact Statement for Laoyemiao-Jining Highway
(2) The proposed highway is advantageous to the local economy growth and improvement of
zonal infrastructure. They hope to start as soon as possible.
(3) They agree on land acquisition requiring that as less fannland be occupied as possible and
compensation fund be given.
(4) The local govemments, local communities and NGO are ready to play a supporting role
land acquisition and resettlement.
(5) They hope to build more transverse passageways in highway design and pay more
attention to environmental protection.
11.3 Summary of Public Participation
The investigation indicates that 95% of the masses agree on the construction of the highway;
84% of the masses agree on land acquisition and resettlement; 98% of the masses consider that the
construction of the highway is advantageous to the local economy development; 90% of the
masses think that the proposed highway is good for improving their living standards. They all
support the project.
The concems of the public are summarized as follows:
1. To use as less good farmland as possible and compensate for the farmland used properly.
2. To arrange resettled household timely and properly according to relevant policy and
regulations to ensure that their living standards not lowed.
4. 78 passageways, 9 grade separations, 8 large bridges and 30 middle-sized or small briges will be
built, which has already been considered in the design. There are about 8 passageways per 10 kn
for pedestrians and motor traffic.
According to Mission Aide Memoire (Jan. 10-13, 2002), additional public consultation will be
conducted in February. The consultation will set its target on ordinary residents in each village. The
plan intends to consult addition 500 persons. The results of the consultation will be submitted to the
Bank as an independent report.
The EA documents will be disclosed domestically no later than January 22, 2002.

Environmental Impact Statement for Laoyemiao-Jining Highway
14 SUMMARIES AND CONCLUSIONS
14.1 Assessment of Current Environment along the Route
14.1.1 Acoustic Environment
1.The noise levels in the rural areas along the route are 42.4-56.0dB and 34.4-49.5dB in
daytime and at night respectively, complying with Class 4 in GB3095-93. The level at Dagong
school meets class I standard in GB3095-93.
2. The noise levels on either side of the national truck line reach Class 4 in daytime 20m away;
Class 4 at night 50m away.
To sum up, the areas along the route are with fairly good acoustic quality.
14.1.2 Ecological Environment
I .The ecological environment along the alignment is of undulate bench and river basin plain
types with farning and husbandry industry. The areas of Shangshanhao along the proposed highway
enjoys good farming condition with other areas being deserts or pastures with weak ecological
environment.
2.The area belongs to "Protection Forest Areas of Three North" with very poor vegetation
cover of 10-30%.
3 .Extent of soil erosion: light water erosion with a module of 500-2000 t/km2 * a: light wind
erosion.
4. crop a year with a yield of 100-200 kg per mu.
5. Rare plants and animals worthy protecting are hardly found along the route.
14.1.3 Social Surroundings
1. Being the hubs of transportation, Hohhot and Jining will be formed into the development
zones leading to economical growth in other neighboring areas. It will serve as an important
strategic position in both Inner Mongolia and the Northwest. However, the economy in these
regions relatively backward. The resources have not sufficiently been exploited.
2. Agriculture is the leading industry along the route, and is one of the poorest areas
receiving assistance from the country. The average income of farmers is 825 -1517 yuan. They live
a hard life.
The areas are inhabited by a number of nationalities. The ration of Han, Mongolian and Hui is
94.1-97.8%, 1.9-3.4%and 0.2-1.4%o
14.1.4 Ambient Air
The mean hourly and daily concentrations of CO and NO2 are lower than Class 2 in GB3095-
1996, and in general, the existing ambient air quality in fairly good.
14.1.4 Water Environment
The water quality of the Yinzi River is of Class I of Surface water and that of the Bawang
River of Class 3. In general, the surface water can reach Class 3 of water due to existing situation of
water quality.
14.2 EIA of the Project
14.2.1 Acoustics
1. The traffic noise in operation phase will not have notable impacts on the environment in
109



Environmental Impact Statement for Laoyemiao-Jining Highway
daytime in the study area. The noise levels in the villages along the route are in accordance with
Class 4 of GB3096-93 basically. The noise level at the school meets the Class I of GB3096-93.
2. The traffic noise during operation phase will have impacts to some extent on the
environment. In short-term operation, 3 villages will exceed the standards at night, Dajing Village
and Bashixing Village in particular.
3. In Table 5-6 are listed the necessary noise mitigation measures to control the excess below
3.0-4.0dB.
4. Generally speaking, this project has minor impacts on acoustic environment. With the
implementation of the mitigation measures suggested in the Report, the impacts of the traffic noise
on the environment will be reduced to a minimum.
14.2.2 EIA on Ecological Environment
1. The occupation of land for the highway construction will have no notable impacts on land
use in general resulting in minor change in biomass. Therefore, the project construction will not
affect the types of ecological environment and its features.
2.The land occupied for the project is mostly of waste land and dry land with low yield
(accounts for 55.87% of the total land occupied. The loss in grains due to land acquisition will be
minor with less than 3 kg per person each year.
3.Greening will be implemented within the right-of-way along the whole alignment to
improve ecological environment in the study area.
4. The landscape along the route will be beautified along the alignment.
14.2.3 Impact Assessment on Soil Erosion
I.During construction phase the earth works and embankment engineering will result in
remarkable hydraulic erosion. Besides, at various borrow sites there will be wind erosion because of
strong winds. However, the soil erosion are local and of short-term, and it can be controlled. With
implementation of embankment protection work, drainage systems and greening works, the soil
erosion resulting from subgrade slope protection can be controlled in an effective way. Eventually,
the soil erosion will be restored to the original levels prior to the construction or the erosion will be
even less the existing one.
2.There will be no uncontrollable environmental problems if sand-fixation and other soil
conservation measure in Chapter 7 are taken.
14.2.4 Impact Assessment on Social Environment
I .The construction is viable because of its good economical benefits and cost/benefit capacity.
2.The construction of the highway is the necessity for completion of the national highway
networks, the national trunk line configuration and the main highway frame of Inner Mongolia. It is
a very important step for economic transmission to the central and western parts and for improving
infrastructure facilities in Inner Mongolia. The proposed project will have significant social benefits
by playing an important role in business, trade, industry, agriculture, husbandry, transport and
tourism. Thus, it will promote the local economical growth along the alignment.
3. 7,491.128 mu of land will be acquired for the project construction (accounting for 50.66%
of acquired land including 32.9% of paddy field and 17.77% of dry land with low yield). The route
alignment is designed rationally by avoiding cities along the route. It will not have adverse impacts
on the life of the public by providing financial compensation and resettlement.
5. Effective engineering facilities will ensure that the water conservation facilities, surface water
regimes, highway networks can work well. 8 passageways will be built per 10 km for traffic of
110

the public and husbandry.
14.2.5 Impact Assessment on Ambient Air
During the operation stage, the vehicular waste gases along alignment will have minor
impacts on the air due to the speedy wind and strong diffusion capacity.
14.2.6 Impact Assessment on Water Quality
1. During the operation period, the storm-water coming from bridge surface will have slight
effects on the water quality in the Yinzi River and Bawang River, with the water quality remaining
unchanged.
2. The domestic sewage from service centers, administrative divisions, toll stations and
maintenance sections and car-washing waste water will affect water quality, so it can not be
discharged before treated properly.
3. Although there is little possibility of risk of hazardous materials spill, it occurs
accidentally with severe consequences. Therefore it is required that effective measures be taken to
prevent it from happening.
14.2.7 EIA during Construction Phase
During construction phase, there is potential to have serious dust pollutant and noise resulting
from heavy construction machinery, earth/lime mixing equipment and asphalt mixers. Vegetation
will be damaged as because of big borrow leading to great soil erosion. In addition, the sewage from
construction camps and garbage and bridge construction will have effects on water quality.
Although the effect during the construction stage is short-term consequence, environmental
protection measures must be taken according to the Environmental Plans (Table 12-3) by
strengthening supervision and monitoring to reduce the impacts to a minimum or to be alleviated.
14.2 Summaries and Conclusions of EIA
The construction of the highway from Laoyemiao to Jining will have remarkable
both financial and social benefits, so all community and public in the study area are in
favor of it. The alignment is designed rationally in the following ways: it has avoided
Xinghe county town site and the town of Jining City. Also, it has occupied as less
farmland as possible. It will have minor impacts on the living environment of the
residents along the route during the operation phase. It will not affect the ecological
environment species and their features much. Under the environmental protection
measures in the Environmental Plans for the project, highway protection works,
drainage works will be ensured. As a result, the environment can be protected, and soil
erosion can be controlled or improved.
To conclude, from the viewpoint of environmental assessment, the project is
feasible because there are not any major environmental factors that will constrain its
construction.

The terrain of this area slopes gently. It has long history of farming
in this area. There are many residents living and active in this densely
populated area for living and production. It is unlivable for the wild
animals. Therefore, the wild animals of rare and in severe danger are

fauna and flora are beyond Wulanchabu League. The proposed highway
will not affect the environmental protection area of wild fauna and flora
in Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region.
