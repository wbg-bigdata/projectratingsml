1.   Project Context, Development Objectives and Design
1.1 Context at Appraisal
1.     Country context. The Country Status Report (CSR) of 2002 described Niger as one of the
world's poorest countries with extremely limited prospects resulting from: (i) explosive population
growth; (ii) a lack of natural resources and a highly degraded natural environment; and (iii) very
limited international competitiveness due to low human and institutional capacity. The CSR also
pointed to the years of poor governance and the country’s location in a potentially volatile sub-
region as further handicaps.
2.      Despite these daunting challenges, the 2003 CAS described: (i) improved macroeconomic
performance over the preceding years; (ii) increased flows of donor support and interim debt relief
since attaining the enhanced Heavily Indebted Poor Country (HIPC) Decision Point in December
2000; and (iii) a strong poverty reduction framework to achieve significant progress towards the
Millennium Development Goals (MDGs). To maximize the effectiveness of the available
resources, the CAS emphasized strengthening government capacity to: (i) build consensus around
sectoral strategies and expenditure programs; (ii) plan, coordinate (with its partners), and manage
development programs; and (iii) decentralize the delivery of basic services.
3.      Health situation. While noting the contribution of negative factors to the extreme
vulnerability of poor Nigeriens, particularly women and children, the CSR also described Niger’s
progress in improving its health indicators over the previous decade. It cautioned, however, that as
a HIPC country, Niger would need to: (i) rapidly meet several human development targets agreed
on in the 2002 Poverty Reduction Strategy Paper (PRSP) to remain on track for the debt initiative;
and (ii) make measurable progress toward achieving the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs).
Among the principal obstacles faced by the country were:
           its poverty, with an annual gross national income per capita of only US$180 placing it
            among the world’s poorest countries;
           its population growth, with one of the highest population growth rates in the world at
            3.1%, a total fertility ratio of 7.5 children per woman, and the prospect of reaching 53
            million people by 2050 and becoming the second highest populated West African
            country after Nigeria; and
           its significant gaps in the results achieved in rural (where 80% of the population live)
            and urban areas and among various socio-economic groups1.
4.      The Project Appraisal Document (PAD) summarized the key issues in the health sector in
terms of: (i) inequitable access with only 28% of rural populations (as opposed to 99% of urban
populations) within 5km of basic health services and fees (especially for hospital services)
representing significant barriers to health seeking behavior, particularly for infants and young
children; (ii) insufficient quality of existing health services resulting from inadequate human
resources and periodic stock-outs of drugs and consumables; (iii) chronic underfunding of the health
sector contributing to imbalances (between investment and recurrent costs) and poor allocation of
sector resources; and (iv) inadequate capacity to carry out basic sector management functions (for
health policy and regulation, program planning and implementation, resource mobilization and

 As an example, the Demographic Health Survey (DHS) of 1998 showed a modern contraceptive prevalence rate of
only 2.1% in rural areas as opposed to 18.6% in urban areas.

                                                                                                               1
disbursement, etc.), exacerbated by a lack of coordination among the different technical and
financial development partners.
5.      Country Assistance Strategy and Rationale for Bank Involvement. As noted in the
Poverty Reduction Strategy (2002), the Bank and the Government agreed that: (i) continued
progress on the health reform agenda was of fundamental importance; and (ii) a progressive shift
towards consolidated programmatic lending (ie. Development Program Lending) would be the
preferred lending instrument to maximize the development impact of Bank support. As part of its
existing or planned portfolio, the Bank was also involved in three other operations in health-related
areas: HIV/AIDS (MAP); Population Project (PRODEM), and the budget support project (RSRC-2)
which included a number of reform measures in health and population as “triggers? for tranche
releases. Sector work was also planned in nutrition.
6.      The project’s objectives were in line with most recent Country Assistance Strategy (of
January 21, 2003), particularly with respect to the CAS pillars for: (i) improving the access of the
poor to quality social services; and (ii) strengthening institutional and individual capacity both
within and outside the Government.         More specifically, the CAS directly targeted human
development deficiencies and the vulnerabilities resulting from them and sought to: (i) support the
Government in developing and implementing an appropriate strategy on population; (ii) intensify
the fight against HIV/AIDS; (iii) improve the delivery of basic education; and (iv) make water
infrastructure accessible to the poor.
7.     The Bank intended to support the implementation of the Health Development Plan (2005-
2009) with a focus on policy dialogue and areas where IDA could best exercise its leverage,
experience, and expertise. These included two significant innovations for which the Bank had an
important comparative advantage: (i) emphasizing capacity building within MOH at all levels,
which had not been done previously; and (ii) introducing a Sector-Wide Approach (SWAp), with
donors agreeing to work jointly on project preparation and implementation and to carry out joint
annual reviews of work plans and sector performance. Noting the Bank’s strong support of SWAps
(with generally good results) in the health sector in several African and Asian countries, the
Government and other development partners recognized the Bank’s experience in providing
technical input to build the requisite capacity and in helping to bridge the identified financial gaps.
1.2 Original Project Development Objectives (PDO) and Key Indicators (as approved)
8.      The PAD presents the PDO as follows: “to improve sector capacity, effectiveness and
efficiency in the provision of essential health care in Niger and contribute to the reduction of
maternal and child mortality by providing a minimum package of essential health services targeted
at the poor, women and children?. The Development Credit Agreement (DCA) phrases the PDO
somewhat differently: to support the Borrower’s Program to improve efficiency and quality of care
in the health system and contribute to the reduction of maternal and child mortality. 2
1.3 Revised PDO (as approved by original approving authority) and Key Indicators, and
reasons/justification
9.      Concerned with the ambition of the PDO and KPI, management urged the team to consider
revisions immediately after effectiveness, at mid-term, and during the final year of project
implementation; restructuring documents were even prepared in the final instance. In the end, the
PDO and KPI were not revised for two reasons: (i) the Government preferred to maintain PDO

    The Task Team preferred the DCA presentation of the PDO.

                                                                                                     2
which were consistent with the National Health Development Plan; and (ii) the DHS results (which
became available after effectiveness) suggested that a number of the indicators could be achieved
during the project. Data on the key outcome and intermediate outcome indicators are presented in
Section F of the Data Sheet and discussed in more detail in Section 3.2 and Annex 2.
1.4 Main Beneficiaries and Benefits
10.      A beneficiary assessment, conducted in rural communities on poverty issues (2003),
highlighted: (i) the importance of health status as a leading cause and consequence of poverty; and
(ii) the challenge of sustaining the demand for health care from poor and rural populations. With a
focus on the poor and other vulnerable groups (primarily women and children), the project was
expected to improve the health status of these beneficiaries by increasing the affordability of,
accessibility to, and quality of public health services. By addressing the broader issues of poverty
reduction, gender and equity, and the increased involvement of communities in managing health
services, the project was also expected to sustain demand for services.
11.     Among the benefits envisioned by the programmatic lending, the project expected to initiate
a phased approach to: (i) rationalize investments by coordinating donor inputs and maintaining the
focus on outcomes and results; (ii) harmonize planning and fiduciary management procedures based
on improved capacity and national systems satisfactory to all the development partners working in
the sector; and (iii) introduce sector budget support or eventual full budget support.
1.5 Original Components
12.     Component 1: Strengthening human resources development and management (US$ 10
million)3. The objectives were to improve efficiency and equity of the health system by optimizing
the distribution and enhancing the performance of human resources through: (i) modernizing human
resource management (including the revision of HR norms, the development of career plans, and
the implementation of training activities both for basic and continuing education); and (ii)
implementing incentive systems to encourage redeployment of personnel in rural areas and reward
individual’s and or unit’s performance in achieving set objectives in their respective annual work
plan.
13.   Component 2: Expansion of services and delivery of minimum health package (MHP)
(US$ 20 million). The objectives were to:
            increase the availability of essential drugs and medical supplies in all public health
             facilities and avoid inventory shortages of a selected list of the most essential drugs
             (including measures to strengthen financing, procurement, and distribution as well as
             increasing private and traditional sector participation in distribution and decreasing
             opportunities for illicit drug distribution);
            strengthen health programs and improve the quality of services (to address the major
             causes of morbidity and mortality of children less than five years old; to implement a
             sound reproductive health strategy with improved protocols for antenatal and post natal
             care; to promote modern family planning methods by integrating services into the
             Minimum Health Package and expanding community based distribution of
             contraceptives and social marketing; to strengthen the integrated management of
             childhood illnesses (IMCI) at community and health facility levels; to develop behavior

                                                                                                                        3
            change strategies and financial and non-financial incentives to increase utilization of
            essential services; and to expand Malaria Subprograms; and
           promote demand and improve geographical access (of the poor) to essential health
            services provided at the primary level by promoting outreach strategies, revising of the
            cost-recovery policy, and adopting measures for the exemption of payment of certain
            services for the poor.
14.    Component 3: Strengthening governance and institutional capacity (US$ 5 million).
The objectives were to:
           Strengthen health system management and institutional capacity to assume the
            responsibilities and tasks defined in the institutional reform framework, comprising
            policy development and analysis, performance monitoring, and evaluation (e.g., sector
            decentralization, district development, and strengthening of personnel capacity);
            strengthening of the infrastructure and equipment management including the
            rationalization of health investments according to a health map; hospital reform; and
            strengthening of the National Health Information System;
           Ensure equitability by improving access to a Minimum Health Package for the whole
            population by increasing resources, developing a redistributive budget allocation
            mechanism to balance regional and district-level disparities, and establishing financial
            protection systems; and
           Improve community participation to strengthen responsibility for administering resource
            mobilization strategies, improving the responsiveness and accountability of the health
            system, and promoting community-based health care.
15.    Component 4: Monitoring and evaluation (US$ million). The objectives were to:
implement appropriate monitoring and evaluation mechanisms regarding Subprograms performance
and ensure good coordination of the monitoring and evaluation activities of the Technical and
Financial Partners.
1.6 Revised Components
16.     The project components were not revised.
1.7 Other significant changes
17.    Though discussions about restructuring the PDO were conducted just after effectiveness, at
the time of the mid-term review, and in the final year of project implementation, the project was
never restructured. A single amendment to the Development Credit Agreement was approved in
2010 to reallocate the proceeds of the project.

2.    Key Factors Affecting Implementation and Outcomes
2.1 Project Preparation, Design and Quality at Entry
18.     From the beginning, the project was conceived as a SWAp with the objectives of
rationalizing investment and donor coordination, focusing on the results established in the Health
Development Plan 2005-10, and assisting MOH in the transition to full-budgetary support for long-
term nature capacity building in the health sector. While in line with Government intentions and
Bank strategy, the design was clearly ambitious, and the project preparation process and design
features reflected the challenges of realizing the sector-wide approach.


                                                                                                  4
19.      Project preparation. Project preparation was initiated in February 2004, with a joint
identification mission comprising the Bank, other international agencies (WHO, UNFPA,
UNICEF), and key donors (European Union, Belgian Cooperation, French Cooperation, Canadian
IDA, Japan, etc). A number of these agencies were already assisting the ministry in: (i) updating
the Health Development Plan (HDP); (ii) examining institutional issues at central, regional, and
district levels; and (iii) analyzing core bottlenecks, using the Marginal Budgeting for Bottlenecks
(MBB) approach to formulate the Medium Term Expenditure Framework (MTEF).
20.     It was expected that the partnership would be maintained throughout the preparation, with
all donors endorsing the approach, participating in the preparation process (with technical assistance
in their areas of competence), and pledging to coordinate their interventions within the revised
HDP. The Bank committed financial resources through a PHRD grant and a PPF to support the
background analysis:
     Submitted in April and approved in July 2004, PHRD financing (TF 053735) in the amount
      of US$ 470,899 was used to carry out studies in the areas of: (i) human resources (census,
      training, planning and managing, incentives); (ii) health service quality assessment; (iii)
      institutional, fiduciary, and management change; and (iv) promotion of the private sector.
      The PHRD grant was closed in September 2005 (with a balance of US$ 75,000).
     At PHRD closing, a Project Preparation Facility (Q4950-NIR) in the amount of US$
      600,000 was approved to continue activities initiated under the PHRD, including: (i)
      implementing institutional changes within the Ministry of Health, especially in the area of
      human resource development; (ii) organizing the preparation of annual action plans for 2006
      (at central, regional and district levels); and (iii) strengthening project coordination and
      implementation tools and capabilities. The refinancing date of the PPF was subsequently
      extended from February to May 2006 and then to August 2006 and was closed with project
      effectiveness in July 2006.
21.     A Project Concept Note (PCN) was reviewed in May 2004, and the proposed project was
endorsed as a potentially effective response to the challenges hindering sector development,
namely: (i) lack of capacity within the sector; (ii) insufficient funding; and (iii) uncertainty and lack
of coordination in donor assistance. An important concern at this stage was the impact of the cost
recovery policy, seen as a major constraint on health service utilization by the poor and needing
revision, for which a study was under way with preliminary conclusions expected in June 2004.
22.   By the completion of the pre-appraisal mission of September 2004, substantial progress had
been made on the basic elements of the project comprising agreements on:
     the objectives of the Health Development Plan, the institutional arrangements and reforms
      (and particularly human resource and financial management), and the budgetary framework
      (MTEF) so as to have a “coherent package for analysis in an integrated manner? for
      discussion with MOH, the Ministry of Finance, and the Civil Service Ministry;
     the core principles for financing with priority to: (i) ensuring (and then maintaining) the
      functionality of existing health facilities before rehabilitating or building new ones; (ii)
      favoring the extremely poor and disadvantaged regions during the budget allocation process;
      and (iii) ensuring proper resource transfer to cost centers at the district level; and
     the substance of the draft letter of understanding which would link the various participants
      in the organization and financing of the sector-wide approach.



                                                                                                       5
23.     Subsequently, three key issues emerged. First, there were political uncertainties related to:
(i) the pending legislative and presidential elections implying the need to re-establish consensus
following any political changes; and (ii) the Ministry of Finance’s reluctance to confirm the
financial projections underlying the financing projections of the HDP implying the need to revise
downward the initial goals and objectives. Second, the challenge of limiting the population’s
contribution to health expenditures (estimated by the national health accounts study at 55% of total
health expenditures) became evident, triggering discussions about the need to urgently define an
exemption policy to allow the poor to have access to a minimum package of services.
24.     Third, the unavailability of IDA funds contributed to a delay in project processing, which
was used by the team to conduct a quality enhancement review (February 2005) and to make
progress on several key implementation readiness areas, including donor coordination and sector
financing, fiduciary arrangements, and a program of reforms within the HDP. These included
proposed measures to: (i) encourage (using incentives) the deployment of more health staff to rural
areas; (ii) exonerate certain groups (poor), products (contraceptives), and services (prenatal care)
from cost recovery; (iii) reform the national drug importing and distribution system; and (iv)
introduce performance based management.
25.     The decision meeting and appraisal mission were conducted in June 2005, negotiations were
held in November 2005, and the project was approved by the Board in December 2005.
26.      Project design. The proposed project was the third operation in the health sector in Niger,
following: (i) the Health Development Project (1986-1995; US$27.8 million); and (ii) the Health
Sector Development Project (1996-2003; US$40 million), which contributed to the implementation
of the HDP (1994-2000). Both projects emphasized sector reform (to organize and finance the
sector; strengthen the management of human resources, pharmaceuticals; improve service delivery;
etc.) but were ultimately considered unsatisfactory for having failed to effectively strengthen
institutional capacity and human resources as a prelude to addressing the key systemic issues. .
27.     The option of a third standard project to finance specific activities was briefly considered,
but it was rejected as inadequate given: (i) the existing strategic framework (the MDGs, PRSP, and
HDP); (ii) the sector’s systemic and management issues and the ongoing RSRC 2 (DPL2) intended
to address key policy bottlenecks in the health sector (e.g., budget allocation and execution, human
resource management, implementation of selected, fully subsidized services, etc.); and (iii) the need
to quickly develop and align health sector implementation capacity with the PRSC approach.
28.     The ICR of the previous project had discussed “lessons learned? particularly with respect to:
(i) being realistic about the scope and speed of health sector reform; (ii) ensuring that the indicators
chosen are really appropriate and reasonable; (iii) being ready for implementation; and (iv) defining
what improved quality really means to stakeholders, especially the rural poor. But, as the Quality
Enhancement Review (QER) comments suggest, the SWAp design did not easily allow the team to
incorporate these lessons.
29.     First, the identification mission optimistically envisioned a two-phased approach with early
testing followed by extensive pooling after the mid-term review; but the PCN described a SWAp
which would almost certainly be a “hybrid? and “modest? in its ambitions, given the limited
national capacity and number of participating partners. The QER urged the team “to be more
explicit and candid about the project approach? (SIL or SIM) and indicate strengths (using
performance-based support to achieve certain objectives) and weaknesses (indicating that it will
make progress towards a SWAp at some undefined time in the future). The project was ultimately



                                                                                                      6
identified as a SIM, and the PAD attempted to address the other concerns in the draft Memorandum
of Understanding (MoU) included in the PAD (Annex 17).
30.     Second, the QER questioned several other design issues related to the feasibility of: (i)
linking broad support of the Health Development Plan with targeted assistance in selected areas
(human resources management, financial management, institutional and organizational change, and
reproductive health interventions); (ii) coordinating formal and informal arrangements to manage
the complementarity of sector financing; and (iii) combining managerially challenging initiatives
(performance-based results) and ambitious institutional changes (decentralization, direct funds
transfers, etc.). The PAD responded to these concerns with additional annexes (Annexes 15, 18, 19,
and 21).
31.     Third, the QER also focused extensively on Niger’s estimated financial needs for the health
sector, questioned whether IDA’s proposed annual contribution would “be sufficient to have an
impact?, and urged the team to consider disbursing over less than five years (as a faster transition to
a SWAp approach) or increasing the size of the IDA credit. The PAD included a lengthy
discussions of sector financing (in Annex 1, which also identified other sources of sector financing,
Annex 2, and Annex 9), but did not directly address the issue of whether the amount of the credit
was sufficient.
32.     Finally, though the QER did not focus explicitly on the risk table presented in the PAD, the
dozen or so risks (and risk mitigation measures) might have been addressed in more detail. In
retrospect, each of the potential risks was correctly identified and accurately assessed, and several
were especially prescient, notably the risk of sustaining leadership in the context of rapid
organizational and technical change. The decision meeting revisited several of the design features
and also expressed concern about the fiduciary capabilities of the ministry.
33.    At negotiations, a number of important design features were confirmed, and agreement was
reached on the details of the Malaria Booster component. At that point, while all of the partners
remained supportive of the approach, but only the French Development Agency (AFD) remained as
a formal partner with the Bank in financing the project.
34.      Quality at Entry. The QER panel suggested that in addition to the usual implementation
readiness items in the fiduciary areas, the task team have in place by negotiations: (i) the MoU with
the donors (which had been the intention of the task team); (ii) the first year annual work program
for the health sector with full funding secured; and (iii) the clarification of the
harmonization/coordination mechanisms. These recommendations were followed but, along with
ratification of the credit agreement, delayed effectiveness until July 20, 2006.
2.2 Implementation
35.     Already ambitious, the project was implemented in an evolving national context
characterized by: (i) initial overall political stability (which was subsequently followed by periods
of political instability); (ii) the introduction of autonomy for governing at the local community
level; and (iii) key reforms in the areas of public financial management and public procurement.
Project implementation within the health sector context was marked by: (i) the expected difficulties
of implementing a sector-wide approach 4 ; and (ii) the introduction of free health services for
specific groups as part of the President’s Special Program. The result was a project implemented at
two different speeds, with modest advances in implementing the SWAp accompanied by often

substantial advances in results.
36.     Project disbursement. The original Development Credit Agreement (Cr 4141-NIR) in the
amount of SDR 24.2 million (US$35.0 million equivalent) was signed on February 16, 2006 and
became effective on July 20, 2006. Financing agreements to participate in the pooled account (or
Common Fund) were subsequently reached with the French Development Agency (as a condition of
effectiveness), the Spanish Development Agency, GAVI, and UNICEF. Initially, it was expected
that the Common Fund would: (i) receive funds from IDA and AFD based on periodic Financial
Monitoring Reports (FMRs)5; and (ii) disburse funds directly against an agreed-to annual action
plan (AAP). A summary of the cumulative disbursements into the Common Fund (by source) and
the expenditures of the Common Fund (by category) is presented below.6

37.     The project had early disbursement delays (only 43% of the proceeds had been disbursed as
of June 2009), resulting from the ministry’s limited administrative and technical capacity in
implementing the report-based disbursement process. The pace of disbursements increased rapidly
thereafter, due in large measure to improved training of fiduciary staff and a series of sizeable
procurements for works (ministry expansion and hospital/health center rehabilitation) and goods
(ARVs and malaria drugs and supplies).
38.     Project implementation. Project success was predicated on implementing reforms,
strengthening partnerships, and enhancing the effectiveness and efficiency of the sector, which
would together contribute to the achievement of the PDO. In the end, project implementation took
a somewhat different path with: (i) impressive progress on most of the key performance indicators;
and with considerable investments of time and money, and (ii) slow (but positive) movement on the
reforms, partnerships, and ways of doing business. Throughout project implementation,
achievement of the PDO, implementation progress, and the different components were all
consistently rated Satisfactory or Moderately Satisfactory. Progress on the key performance

audit as a condition for its second tranche release.

indicators is treated in a subsequent section; progress on implementing several of the SWAp
elements mentioned by the IEG study are discussed below.
39.     Reforms: Though intended to enhance the reform process7, the project’s progress was (as
might be expected) uneven, with advances in some areas and setbacks in others; some examples: (i)
the ministerial reorganization recognized the crucial importance of human resources and nutrition
and established national directorates, but modified the Directorate of Reproductive Health to be the
Directorate for Mother and Child Health; (ii) the development of health financing policy recognized
the importance of reducing the burden imposed by cost recovery did not find a sustainable means to
ensure free health services and strengthen supply chain management for drugs and other
consumables; and (iii) the management of human resources (including the use of performance
contracts) accomplished a number of important actions (HR management systems, HR planning,
curriculum reform and training, etc.), but effective change in deployment, motivation, career
development, etc. (necessarily involving the Ministries of Finance and Civil Service) was difficult
to achieve.
40.      Partnerships: The quality and functionality of partnerships varied between government and:
(i) its partners (and among the partners); and (ii) the Bank and AFD as the principal partners in the
Common Fund.
      Government and its partners: As in most developing countries, the multilateral, bilateral,
       and NGO agencies follow their own institutional mandates, agendas, and procedures, though
       most have aligned their technical interventions (at Government insistence) with the Health
       Development Plan. Relationships are (mostly) cordial with frequent (at least 4-5 times a
       year) meetings between the Ministry and its partners and, with Ministry agreement, partners
       were encouraged to meet and harmonize their viewpoints for discussion. However, while
       several additional partners were attracted to the Common Fund, there does not seem to have
       been a concerted effort to encourage and/or recruit other partners, even on partial or limited
       terms.
      Common Fund partners: While AFD, the Bank, and the Government have generally agreed
       on procedures, these have involved numerous documents: legal (credit agreement and
       convention), procedural (procedures manual), and interpretational (memorandum of
       understanding-lettre d’entente and a memorandum of operational procedures-note de
       conduite) which have not in every case resolved all of the issues to the satisfaction of the
       three parties. In addition, while the different parties agreed on the basic program documents
       (MTEF, Annual Action Plans and Budgets, Biannual progress reports, etc.), they were not
       uniformly in agreement on a number of issues including the timing and alignment of
       document submission and the criteria for the periodic disbursements into the Common Fund.
41.     Ways of doing business: The SWAp sought to: (i) enhance efficiency with increased
predictability, flow, and use of sector financial resources; and (ii) strengthen program effectiveness
with improved tools and processes to plan, budget and manage funds, and measure results. From a
financing perspective, the sector suffered and has continued to suffer from chronic underfunding
from domestic resources. This has become particularly critical as the government has fallen behind
in its commitment to provide health facilities with the funds lost through the removal of user fees
for targeted populations.



7
 In addition to the project, several of the PRSC triggers involved health sector reform measures for financing, HR,
sector management, etc.

                                                                                                                      9
42.      Health sector spending continues to rely extensively on external sources: over the 2006-11
period, external funding constituted 60% of total health spending, of which the Common Fund
accounted for 7%. What distinguished the Common Fund (essentially a co-financed project) from
other externally funded projects and was particularly appreciated by the Ministry were: (i) its
institutional placement within the ministry8; (ii) its transparency about the potential amounts and
uses of the funds; and (iii) its availability to all eligible recipients at central, regional, and district
levels.
43.     Progress was made in introducing planning instruments, though the sector struggled with: (i)
the planning/budgeting exercise which involved multiple levels and did not fully coincide with the
Government’s fiscal year budgeting process; (ii) inadequate budget ceilings for the annual plans
which resulted in multiple reviews and negotiations; and (iii) lengthy delays in approval by AFD
and the Bank (e.g., May for the 2008 fiscal/calendar year) 9 which reduced the effective time
available for implementing the annual action plans.
44.      While the Ministry was making slow progress10 in some areas of the SWAp-related program
elements (administrative reforms; partnerships; program initiatives; and health sector resource
management), fundamental changes were occurring in other areas (e.g., allocating adequate
resources to regions and districts reforms and planning and managing for results). Service
utilization expanded dramatically as a result of: (i) the expansion of the health post (case de santé)
and their transformation into health centers; (ii) the financing of outreach activities (particularly by
the project); and (iii) the progressive introduction of free health services: caesarians (November
2005), children under 5 and contraceptives (April 2006), and female cancers (July 2007). The
following table shows the rapid increase in the use of services by these targeted population groups11.

2.3 Monitoring and Evaluation (M&E) Design, Implementation and Utilization
45.     M&E design. Based on the inadequacies of Monitoring and Evaluation (M&E) of the
previous projects, project preparation addressed the following M&E challenges: (i) the definition of
the indicators; (ii) the reliability of data collection systems; and (iii) the analysis and use among
local, national, and international partners for coordination, decision-making, and policy. Upon


8
  The Ministry was assisted by: (i) a small team of contracted personnel responsible for specific fiduciary aspects of the
Common Fund; and (ii) TA, recruited with separate AFD funds, responsible for accompanying the reform process.
9
  AFD funded TA was expected to strengthen the annual action planning and programming process, but the tendering
process, initiated in 2006, was not completed until mid-2008. Given the criticisms heard from the different Common
Fund participants during the ICR mission, it would not appear that the TA was able to resolve these fundamental
problems.
10
   The PAD accurately noted these risks in the risk assessment.
11
   An audit of the growth of free health services and the use of the government’s reimbursement of health facilities is
expected by the end of November 2011 and may explain (among other things) the drop in antenatal care in 2009-2010.

                                                                                                                        10
adoption of the HDP 2005-10, agreement was reached on a monitoring and evaluation guide (April
2006) which: (i) proposed indicators and methods for calculating and analyzing the indicators; and
(ii) established structures, roles, and responsibilities for ensuring the use of the information.
46.     The monitoring and evaluation guide identified 45 indicators from the Health Development
Plan, and established annual expected values (objectives) for virtually all of the indicators
throughout the 2006-10 period. These performance indicators reflected the overall program, and the
project identified 23 (4 outcome indicators and 19 intermediate outcome indicators) for inclusion in
the credit agreement. In addition, financial indicators were agreed on in collaboration with the
Ministry of Finance to: (i) ensure coherence between the MTEF and the HDP operational plans; and
(ii) monitor budget allocations and transfers to the regions and districts. Finally, the monitoring
measures took into account the IDA’14 core indicators and the results of the Financial Monitoring
Reports (FMR) and annual audits.
47.     Baselines were established in accordance with the results presented in the HDP (based on
routine data collection and surveys) and in the Demographic and Health Survey (DHS) of 200612.
Periodic data collection instruments and procedures were agreed on as were specific evaluation
studies and assessments to be repeated at mid-term and again at project completion. Structures and
processes were set up to ensure the timely production and consideration of the information
produced             by:          (i)          a        national         technical          committee;
(ii) regional health technical committees; (iii) broader regional committees to include elected
officials; and (iv) the local health district committees13. The modalities for disseminating the results
were established by the M&E guidelines.
48.     Implementation. Monitoring and evaluation were consistently rated Satisfactory or
Moderately Satisfactory throughout the entire project period, and the quality of the data was Good.
The ISRs noted problems only with the delays in: (i) organizing the mid-term review due to the
recruitment of consultants to carry out the external evaluation; and (ii) implementing measures to
strengthen the management information system due in part to the slow knowledge transfer from
existing TA to the Ministry staff. In addition, three issues merit discussion.
49.     First, despite the efforts to reach consensus on and define the essential indicators for the
program, there were concerns that they were too numerous and imprecise and (particularly) too
ambitious for the duration of the project 14 . Supervision missions periodically considered
restructuring the PDO (to replace infant and maternal mortality indicators with more process-
oriented indicators) and reducing the number of intermediate outcome indicators. Management also
concurred with the team’s assessment that performance indicators are marred by unreliable
denominators perhaps leading to some over-optimistic assessments of project performance. But in
the end, the list of indicators was not changed and the Bank’s concerns did not materialize as data of
acceptable quality was routinely available for these indicators.
50.    Second, the schedule for collecting and aggregating routine information for the semi-annual
reviews turned out to be overly optimistic. Despite significant improvements in the organization of
the Management Information System (MIS) 15 , the interim MIS data were of limited usefulness
because of the incompleteness of the information. But the quality of the annual data in the


12
   Conducted in 2005, the DHS results were not entirely available prior to project effectiveness.
13
   See Annex 16 of the PAD.
14
   See the QAG assessment of May 2008.
15
   Including the creation of the National Directorate for Statistics, Surveillance, and Epidemiological Response
(DSS/RE).

                                                                                                                   11
Statistical Directories (which appeared 3-6 months after the end of the calendar year) was good and
generally consistent with the periodic surveys conducted. Similarly, organization of some of the
follow-up evaluations was not possible; for instance, the DHS scheduled for 2010 was postponed
because it conflicted with the population census. But the project benefited from continuing efforts
(by UNICEF in particular) to organize small annual evaluations using the DHS modules (2008,
2009 and 2010) and organized the contraceptive prevalence survey to obtain information on this
indicator.
51.    Third, while the monitoring of health results was systematically done, important elements of
the sector-wide approach were not sufficiently monitored: (i) process measures, including
benchmark definitions of appropriate operational and administrative results (e.g., financing,
coordination, harmonization among partners, etc.), were not adequately measured 16 ; and (ii)
performance-based contracting never received the attention that was initially indicated in the PAD.
52.     Utilization. The reviews of the sector were generally held as scheduled at the different
levels, but essentially focused on assessing the physical and financial achievements of the Annual
Action Plan; more strategic discussions of sector performance were less frequent and, at least in the
cases of the principal sector reforms, do not seem to have had much impact on the development of
the regulatory framework or its subsequent application.
53.     M&E is rated Substantial, based on the Independent Evaluation Group (IEG)'s criteria for
assessing the design, implementation, and utilization of the data as they are applied to the
monitoring and evaluation of financial inputs, program outputs, and implementation outcomes by
the M&E system. Based on the detailed operational plan for monitoring and evaluating the Health
Development Plan for 2011-15, the M&E system will certainly be sustained, though some of the
specific project-related indicators may be eliminated and replaced by others.
2.4 Safeguard and Fiduciary Compliance
54.     Environment. At appraisal, the project was categorized as B, with the overall assessment
that the generation of medical waste at the project's health care facilities would be the major
safeguard issue, which, if left unattended, could have significant long-term negative impacts on the
environment and public health. To address this issue, the Borrower prepared a medical waste
management, based on the National Medical Waste Management Plan (2003) and consultations
with the relevant technical services at central and regional levels. The project-specific plan was
disclosed in Niger and at the Bank's Infoshop in May 2005. The project included institutional
support for the MOH to ensure effective implementation of the plan.
55.     An evaluation of the implementation of the plan in 2007 noted shortcomings (due in large
part to delays in developing specifications for procuring incinerators and chlorine production
materials). Despite these difficulties, safeguard compliance was considered Satisfactory through the
mid-term review, which noted the combined efforts of the health and HIV/AIDS projects in
providing waste management infrastructure for health facilities and protective equipment for
individuals. Safeguard compliance was considered Moderately Satisfactory after the mid-term
review, primarily because the incinerators and equipment financed by the Common Fund were not
fully functional and not all of the planned waste management activities were fully implemented. A
new version of the plan was adopted within the context of the adoption of the revised Health
Development Plan 2011-15 and was approved by IDA.


16
  The QAG review concluded that more realistic indicators better linked to institutional strengthening could have been
chosen.

                                                                                                                    12
56.    Procurement, Disbursement, and Financial Management. The initial review of fiduciary
capabilities was based on the PEMFAR report of November 2003, which noted problems with the
management of human resources, the budgeting process (insufficient analysis, inadequate
execution, etc.), the procurement process, and the accuracy and accessibility of public financial
information (weak accounting and auditing). Fiduciary arrangements were based on guidelines
prepared by the Bank for use in program approaches17.
57.     During implementation, procurement performance was rated Satisfactory or Moderately
Satisfactory, except for the period just after the mid-term review, when the rating was downgraded
to Moderately Unsatisfactory based the deteriorating quality and speed of procurement. The
procurement specialist was subsequently replaced, an Independent Procurement Review was carried
out, and the rating revised.
58.     During project implementation, a total of 128 tenders were executed; the number and value
of these tenders are summarized in the following table by method and category.
                          Table 3: Summary of procurement methods and values by category

59.      Overall, procurement issues focused most often on: (i) the lack of procurement capabilities;
(ii) the difficulties of precisely defining needs and formulating appropriate specifications and terms
of                                                                                           reference;
(iii) the delays involved with the procurement procedures (resulting in part from the multiple review
procedures of the Common Fund partners); and (iv) poor contract management and record keeping.
60.      Disbursement and financial management were specific concerns during preparation,
particularly:
 (i) the roles, responsibilities, and capabilities of personnel within the Directorate of Finances; and
(ii) the abilities of the Regional Directorates both to accurately plan expenditures and to manage the
subsequent accounting and information steps. At pre-appraisal, Terms of Reference (TOR) were
prepared to recruit TA to strengthen regional accounting capabilities. By effectiveness, the Bank
confirmed that financial management tools were in place and the quality of financial management
(FM) staff is reasonable. A detailed action plan for strengthening financial management was
presented in the PAD.

 Fiduciary Arrangements for Sector Wide Approaches (SWAps) : Interim Guidelines to Staff Issued by the Financial
Management and Procurement Sector Boards November 22, 2002

                                                                                                              13
61.     During project implementation, the project experienced two different types of problems: (i)
disbursement difficulties due to initial inexperience in using the semi-annual Financial Management
Reports (FMRs) which was subsequently remedied18 and frequent delays in the joint review of the
FMR by AFD and the Bank; and (ii) recurring difficulties allowable expenditures due for the most
part to misunderstandings about the eligibility of certain expenses and the delays in justifying
expenditures incurred at regional and district levels. Though these problems were quickly rectified,
several of the annual audits were qualified.
2.5 Post-completion Operation/Next Phase
62.      Programmatically, the major orientations of the HDP 2005-2010, which served as the
framework for program implementation, have been: (i) reviewed, revised, and incorporated into the
HDP                                                                                   2011-2015;
 (ii) officially adopted by the Government; and (iii) signed by Niger as part of the international
Compact to achieve the Millennium Development Objectives. The document provides a clear
vision of how the Ministry intends to move forward with its sector reforms and priority program
activities.
63.    Institutionally, the essential structures and processes, which have guided implementation so
far have been endorsed by the Government and the Partners. Modifications are anticipated for the
basic documents regulating project implementation (memorandum of understanding, project
implementation manual, etc.). Two major differences in the immediate future should be cited: (i)
the ambiguity of the Bank’s role during the coming year when it will be present in the sector but
absent from the Common Fund; and (ii) the ability of the other Common Fund members (some of
which are not permanently present in Niamey) to support implementation from a distance.
64.     Financially, the resources available for the Common Fund will be greatly reduced over the
coming 9-12 months. At the time of the ICR (almost three months after project closing), the effects
had not yet been felt for the implementation of the 2011 AAP and no particular dispositions had yet
been taken to reduce ceiling for programming the 2012 AAP. In addition, while the Government
has created large expectations for recurrent expenditures (for free services and additional staff in
particular) and has greatly increased (in absolute terms and as a portion of GDP) the amount of
health sector financing19, it is unclear whether such budgets can be matched with actual spending.
This can already be seen with the financing of the free services:
                            Table 4: Reimbursement rates for the provision of free services
                           Target groups         2006       2007      2008       2009      2010
                      Proportion reimbursed      100%       96%        51%        7%          2%
                      NB. AFD provided financial support over the first two years.

65.     Finally, there is a certain “psychological? aspect to the next phase, in the sense that the
health sector in general (and the Common Fund in particular) has achieved an undisputed credibility
and legitimacy (in comparison, for instance with the education sector) and has settled into a routine.
The capacity to maintain the status quo seems to be in place but the potential sources of vision and
leadership needed to advance the sectoral approach must be further developed.


18
   According to ISR #4, the project became has been an example in the country for the Report-Based disbursements
system.
19
   The share of health financing in the budget has declined meaning that the Government has significantly increased its
obligations to a number of sectors.

                                                                                                                     14
3.    Assessment of Outcomes
3.1 Relevance of Objectives, Design and Implementation
66.     Given the project's consistency with (i) Niger’s poverty policies and health strategy; and (ii)
the Bank’s assistance strategies in general and health sector priorities in particular, the relevance of
the project’s objectives, design, and implementation is rated as High. Specifically, the project was
prepared within the framework of: (i) the overarching Millennium Development Goals; (ii) the
country’s broad development goal of reducing poverty and its narrower objectives of strengthening
governmental reforms and health sector capabilities as a means for reducing poverty; and (iii) the
Bank’s Country Assistance Strategy which included a commitment to providing broad sectoral
support as well as four specific projects to address health sector concerns: PRIASS, PRODEM,
MAP, and the RSRC..
67.     While there were concerns about the project’s relevance during preparation and
implementation (from the limited participation in most aspects of the sector-wide approach, the
inability to implement important reforms and performance measures, the complexities of managing
the fiduciary elements of the Common Fund, etc.), the health project succeeded in sustaining
progress on health outcomes and maintaining the credibility of the approach over the entire
implementation period 20 . The adoption of the revised Health Development Plan for 2011-15
embraces the sectoral elements present in the previous plan.
68.     Delays in the preparation of the CAS (which is expected in 2012) have postponed
consideration of new Bank financing for the health sector, but there are no indications that the
current HDP and the modalities for its implementation have lost any relevance since 2006.
3.2 Achievement of Project Development Objectives
69.     The assessment of outcomes is based on: (i) the results of the Outcome and Intermediate
Outcome Indicators in Section F of the Data Sheet; and (ii) the detailed annexes summarizing the
results of the different surveys and the routine data collection. These results are summarized in the
following table in terms of their level of achievement:

70.     Project efficacy is rated as Substantial. While 95% of the project’s objectives were
completely or partially achieved and the principal objectives to reduce maternal and child mortality
(PDO 1) were achieved, performance on strengthening the health sector (PDO 2) was considerably
less successful. The data are presented below by PDO and component.

  This contrasts with the education project, which suffered from inadequate capacity, difficult procedures, and very
importantly, misappropriation of funds and resulting suspensions. See Str@tec-arc, Analyse et propositions de

73.     In addition to the obvious fact that the end results constitute (in almost all cases) substantial
gains, the annual changes at national level have generally been positive and even those at regional
level have been predominantly positive on an annual basis. In other words, the improvements have
been broad-based and consistent as well as significant.

75.     Both Components 1 and 3 recorded significant accomplishments, but in a number of cases
did not achieve their projected targets.
76.     Overall achievement result. Based on the project's results cited above, the project's overall
efficacy rating is substantial. Though the results of PDO 2 were expected to contribute to the
improvement in the health indicators of PDO 1, this does not seem to have been the case; rather the
somewhat weaker results obtained by PDO 2 for strengthening the health system as a whole do not
seem to have negatively influenced the health indicators.
77.     More important than strengthening the health system as a factor in improving indicators may
be the effect of introducing free health services for specific groups. The following table compares
the use of services by populations which did and did not benefit from the introduction of free health
services.

While there were improvements among services which were not free, they were not nearly as
significant as those among services which were free.
3.3 Efficiency
78.     With respect to program efficiency, the project was assessed on the basis of its allocative
efficiency, its technical efficiency, and its productive efficiency.
79.     Allocative efficiency is achieved when resources are allocated so as to maximize the welfare
of the community, and the project financed services which: (i) focused on the rural areas where the
vast majority of the population continues to live; (ii) emphasized the most vulnerable groups who
are women and children; and (ii) addressed those barriers which reduce physical and financial
access to these services. Utilization rates for these target groups increased substantially at the same
time that mortality rates for these same target groups were rapidly declining.
80.     Technical efficiency is achieved when given resources are used to maximum advantage, and
the project emphasized the most effective interventions for: (i) the sector as a whole (e.g.,
rehabilitating and staffing existing health facilities, expanding the minimum package of essential
services); and (ii) for target groups in particular, namely women (prenatal care, malaria prevention,
assisted delivery and emergency obstetric care, contraceptives) and children (vaccination, malaria
prevention, treatment of malnutrition). Given that services to the key populations (as seen in Table
10) increased significantly over the period while overall health expenditures from all sources
remained roughly stable over the same period (as seen in the following table), the project achieved
substantial technical efficiency.
                          Table 11: Total annual health expenditures (millions CFA)
                                        2005          2006          2007          2008          2009          2010
              Annual expenditures       53 610        62 391        58 306        55 682        57 682        68 200

81.     Productive efficiency is achieved when a health outcome is maximized for a given cost (or
the cost is minimized for a given outcome), and the project expected sector-wide management to: (i)
increase the transparency and coordination in sector financing; (ii) strengthen planning and
budgeting techniques to focus on priorities; and (iii) lower transaction costs of implementation by

                                                                                                                       18
harmonizing procedures and decentralizing disbursements., etc.); and (ii) technical efficiencies (to
to focus, to introduce performance-based management, etc.). Productive efficiency was only
modest, for two reasons:
       The long preparation (usually both tardy and incomplete) by the Ministry and the delayed
        approval of the annual action plans by the Common Fund partners postponed
        implementation from January to February/March or even later (NB, the Bank made
        provisions to finance key activities in anticipation of the later approval). Preparation and
        execution of the procurement plan suffered from these delays, and though the transfer of
        funds from central to district level was rapid, the accounts were closed at the end of
        November, reducing the annual implementation period to 8 or 9 months.
       Though there were annually repeated efforts to prioritize activities in the Annual Action
        Plan, regions routinely planned 600 or more activities per year. The proportion of planned
        activities in the AAP which were actually implemented was routinely between 50-60%, as
        shown in the following table:

82.    On efficiency measures, the project is rated substantial with respect to allocative efficiency,
substantial with respect to technical efficiency, modest with respect to productive efficiency, and
Substantial overall. Related to the PDOs, the project was rated substantial with respect to PDO 1,
modest with respect to PDO 2, and Substantial overall.

3.5 Overarching Themes, Other Outcomes and Impacts
(a) Poverty Impacts, Gender Aspects, and Social Development
84.    Poverty. The project was an integral part of the Government’s poverty reduction strategy,
and given that maternal and child mortality disproportionately affects the poor in Niger, the reported

                                                                                                                                19
outcomes of the project can be assumed to have contributed to the health status of those vulnerable
groups. Demonstrating this conclusion is somewhat more difficult, as shown by Annex 9 of the
PAD, which analyzed Niger’s economic growth between 2001-03 and concluded that: (i) the
growth effect has contributed to poverty reduction without a general increase in inequality; but (ii)
this “pro poor? result has not uniformly translated into an improvement in the health status of the
population. For some socioeconomic groups and some regions (particularly Niamey, Diffa, and
Agadez) the impact on health status was positive; for other groups and regions, the results were less
clear23. While a similar analysis has not been done at project completion, the results in Annexes 10
and 11 by region would seem to suggest that the differential results (at least by region) reported in
the PAD are likely to have continued.
85.    Gender. The introduction of free health services addressed virtually every aspect of
women’s reproductive health except (curiously) simple assisted deliveries and post natal
consultations.
86.     Social development. The project addressed social development in two ways by: (i)
strengthening the participation of the local health management committees responsible for
overseeing the development and delivery of services at the health facility and district levels; and (ii)
reducing the physical, cultural, and financial barriers for utilizing health services. Beneficiary
assessments during project preparation and at mid-term highlighted the difficulties and importance
of sustaining the demand for health care from poor populations. In the mid-term beneficiary
assessment, 53% of those using health services were influenced by the cost (as compared with 40%
for the quality, 32% for the reception, and 25% for the proximity)24.
(b) Institutional Change/Strengthening
87.     The project both benefited from and contributed to a number of ongoing institutional change
and strengthening measures whose long-term impact on capacity in MOH and on the evolution of
sector-wide and budget support approaches has been substantial. In particular, the project benefited
from: (i) the Bank’s interest (and the Paris Declaration’s positions) in sector wide approaches, even
in countries where conditions may not have been ideal; (ii) the Government-led administrative and
financial management reforms promoting essential elements of the sectoral approach; and (iii) the
Government’s recognition 25 and subsequent actions to reduce the detrimental aspects of cost
recovery on the poor.
88.     The project contributed to: (i) operationalizing the sector-wide approach, even if progress
was slow, uneven (both within the health sector and in comparison with, for instance, the education
sector), and relatively undocumented26; (ii) strengthening several Government initiatives, including
decentralized planning, procurement, regional financial management (particularly after the
recruitment of regional accountants), etc.; and (iii) establishing the regulatory and financial
framework for implementing free health services for women and children.
89.     The project also contributed in two other ways. First, the Common Fund made a sustained
effort to rationalize the basis for institutional change by financing the systematic collection of
existing legislative and regulatory texts and the initial drafting of a comprehensive Health Law

of a detailed package of reforms remains problematic because: (i) several of the important reforms
(e.g., mutuelles) are the purview of other ministries; and (ii) the responsibility for developing
priority health legislation and regulation with the Ministry remains with the technical directorates,
which are not always interested in the legal framework for their initiatives. As a consequence, some
reforms may take years and may or may not be supported by the necessary politico-administrative
decisions.
90.     Second, the project contributed to a massive effort to train medical and paramedical staff
within the framework of the 2005-15 human resource development plan. Though this plan has not
yet been evaluated, sectoral capacity will certainly be enhanced by the return of some 800 trained
staff.
(c) Other Unintended Outcomes and Impacts (positive or negative)
3.6 Summary of Findings of Beneficiary Survey and/or Stakeholder Workshops
91.    A beneficiary assessment was organized during project preparation and at the mid-term
review but not at the end of the project.

4. Assessment of Risk to Development Outcome
Rating: Substantial
92.     From a number of perspectives, the risk should be rated as modest: (i) politically, the
sector’s priorities and its role within the overall national development strategy are clearly
understood; (ii) programmatically, the essential structures, tools, and processes for policy
formulation, strategy development implementation, and monitoring and evaluation have been
agreed on and are being used; and (iii) organizationally, capacity within the Ministry (and in other
ministries on which MOH depends) has been significantly improved.
93.     Three important elements contribute to the assessment of substantial risk. First, the
difficulties of advancing the sector-wide approach both in Niger and elsewhere in Africa have
shown that the probability of regressing is usually greater than that of progressing; this may be
particularly the case in Niger because the initial conditions were not particularly favorable and the
current sources of vision and leadership within the Ministry and among the partners are not obvious.
Second, Government financing of the health sector in general and of free services in particular is
tenuous; while not recent, the situation has become more complicated by the Government’s
increasing commitments (for free services, expanded coverage, additional staff, etc.) and decreasing
financial resources. Third, the Bank’s (at least temporary) withdrawal from the sector27 represents,
both materially and symbolically, a very real setback for the sector; though AFD has expressed its
commitment to continue financing the Common Fund, the amounts and the momentum established
over the past five years cannot help but be affected over the near term.

5.   Assessment of Bank and Borrower Performance
5.1 Bank Performance




27
  The Bank is currently updating the CAS and has consequently made no commitment to continued funding of the
Common Fund; under the best of circumstances, it is hard to see the Bank participating financially in the Common Fund
during 2012.

                                                                                                                  21
(a) Bank Performance in Ensuring Quality at Entry
Rating: Satisfactory
94.     In addition to initiating the SWAp process under less than favorable circumstances,
sensitizing and involving the different partners28 in the preparatory steps, and assisting the Borrower
with both the necessary reforms and procedural steps, the project preparation team (with support
from the country management team) also: (i) contributed to several important achievements in the
sector during preparation (e.g., reducing financial barriers to services); (ii) produced a Project
Appraisal Document of high quality; and (iii) established the conditions for a smooth transition
from project to program implementation.
95.     The team succeeded both in guiding the process (through the participation of Ministry of
Health and other Ministry staff, the inclusion of other development partners in the discussions) and
orienting content (promoting free health services, orienting expenditures to ensure the functioning
and quality of existing facilities, etc.). The team’s response to challenges from within the Bank was
equally impressive, as the team worked to achieve consensus on and support for a range of SWAp
processes (legal, procurement, and disbursement).
96.     The quality of the PAD results from: (i) a reliance on the poverty reduction and HDP
documents as the key sector documents; (ii) a recognition of the need to learn from past projects and
clearly establish future measures of achievement prior to project implementation; and (iii) the
comments of the various reviews (PCN, QER, DM) which resulted in the clarification of certain
sections and the preparation of some especially good annexes.
97.    Conditions for smooth implementation were achieved by: (i) building on existing strengths
within the Ministry; and (ii) using the PHRD grant mechanism and PPF financing to establish
measures and maintain the necessary rigor approval of the annual action plans while sustaining the
dynamism for rapid implementation of the agreed upon plans. In addition, a lengthy list of
conditions for effectiveness was set forth comprising: (i) establishment of the necessary fiduciary
procedures (administration, accounting and program management), systems, and personnel; (ii)
adoption of adequately financed annual action plans for 2006; and (iii) signed agreements with the
French Development Agency on the amount and modalities of its collaboration on the project.
(b) Quality of Supervision
Rating: Moderately Satisfactory
98.     Over the life of the project, Bank supervision was characterized by: (i) the continuity of the
Task Team (with a single TTL physically present in the country); and (ii) the frank communication
with the Government in assessing project performance. Because of the extent of the Bank’s HNP
portfolio (with three projects and budget support), the joint financing of the health project, and the
TTL’s physical presence in Niger, the Bank employed several complementary supervision styles,
including: (i) semi-annual joint supervision missions with AFD; (ii) periodic PHN missions (for
health, population and HIV/AIDS); and (iii) day-to-day discussions and problem solving with the
ministry.
99.    Viewed on its own merits, Bank supervision was satisfactory, at least through project
closing; the ambiguous role of the Bank over the coming year (as a participant in the health sector


28
  Including, in particular, the French Development Agency which was not particularly experienced with either the
health sector or the sector-wide approach.

                                                                                                                   22
but not in the Common Fund) will test local staff. The major supervision events identified in the
credit agreement were implemented (e.g., the FMR and annual audits, the mid-term review, and the
ICR), but the annual program implementation reports were somewhat incomplete and reduced the
quality of the supervision. The Implementation Status Reports (ISR) were generally informative
but not particularly useful for monitoring the KPI29. Periodic assessments were also carried out by
procurement and financial management specialists, but they were less informative. A QAG was
conducted prior to the mid-term review.
100. Viewed in conjunction with AFD (and eventually the other partners joining the Common
Fund), supervision was only moderately satisfactory, due to: (i) lack of field-based senior AFD staff
and turnover of AFD HQ staff; (ii) differing views of the documents required for disbursement; and,
most importantly, (iii) delays in providing non-objections for the annual action plans and
procurements (particularly for consulting services). The benefits of commitment to the common
fund and joint supervision missions must be somewhat offset by the transaction costs incurred by all
three parties. Further, the focus on the operational details of implementing the SWAp tended (at
least as seen in the official documents) to dominate sector dialogue to the detriment perhaps of more
programmatic and technical issues.
(c) Justification of Rating for Overall Bank Performance
Rating: Satisfactory
101. Following ICR guidance indicating that when the rating for one dimension is in the
satisfactory range (for the quality at entry) and the other is in the moderately satisfactory range (for
supervision), the rating for overall Bank performance depends on the outcome rating. Bank
performance is therefore rated Satisfactory.
5.2 Borrower Performance
(a) Government Performance
Rating: Moderately Satisfactory
102. The overall Government implementation performance was "moderately satisfactory" based
on: (i) its commitment to poverty reduction and the translation of this commitment into the
elimination of user fees for women and children; and (ii) its support for the implementation of the
Health Development Plan with significant increases (at least in the early years of project
implementation) in health sector budgets. The more recent decline in the financing of health
services for women and children has been problematic.
103. The Ministry of Health succeeded in: (i) institutionalizing a participative and transparent
process of sector review and planning, budgeting and disbursement, and monitoring and evaluation;
(ii) adopting a (limited) number of key reforms; and (iii) executing the credit agreement in
conformity with its covenants and conditions. While there were areas in which performance (e.g.,
nutrition, private sector support) and efficiency were modest, these areas have been included in the
Health Development Plan for 2011-15.
(b) Implementing Agency or Agencies Performance
Rating: Satisfactory



29
  The problem with both the annual implementation report and periodic ISR indicators was that complete data was only
available several months after the close of the year; the systems for periodic reporting were very weak.

                                                                                                                 23
104. Within the Ministry of Health, a small unit comprising selected project implementation
skills (in procurement, financial management, and auditing) was established to support the existing
directorates; with support from this unit and the Common Fund, capacities were improved at
central, regional, and district levels in planning, procurement, financial management, monitoring
and evaluation. As noted earlier, procurement plans were regularly prepared for approval by the
Bank, and bi-annual FMR and annual audits were submitted in a timely manner.
(c) Justification of Rating for Overall Borrower Performance
Rating: Satisfactory
105. Following ICR guidance indicating that when the rating for one dimension is in the
moderately satisfactory range (for the Government) and the other is in the satisfactory range (for the
implementing agency), the rating for overall Borrower performance depends on the outcome rating.
Borrower performance is therefore rated Satisfactory.

6.   Lessons Learned

106. Sector-wide approaches need to carefully balance expectations and forward
momentum. SWAps seek to achieve objectives which simultaneously address issues of sector
leadership, predictable financial flows and allocations (incorporating the principles of equity and
flexibility), harmonized disbursement procedures, and accountability for expenditures and results.
And often, as was the case in Niger, these objectives are established in a context where fundamental
constraints have not appreciably changed. The challenge, as the QAG noted, is to balance the
management of expectations with the need to maintain the momentum of continued development of
the approach: if expectations are too ambitious, then setbacks may discourage future developments;
if expectations are not ambitious enough, then satisfaction with current achievements may produce
complacency.
107. Though good governance, continuity, and sustained commitment of both the Ministry
and its partners are necessary conditions for a successful sector-wide approach, they are not
sufficient. Where SWAps have been particularly successful, vision and leadership must be
continually present in order to maintain forward momentum. Where they are not (and this is
currently the case among the partners in Niger), there is a significant risk for the future development
of the SWAp.
108. While the financial resources allocated by the Common Fund were important, equally
so were the flexibility and decentralized procedures which accompanied these resources. Not
only did the Common Fund improve the response to local needs, the flexible and decentralized
procedures used to channel the funds raised staff motivation (by allowing staff to program priority
activities and implement them in a timely manner), promoted community participation (through
priority setting, planning, and oversight), and improved the ownership of and accountability for the
results achieved.

7. Comments on Issues Raised by Borrower/Implementing Agencies/Partners
109. (a) Borrower/implementing agencies: During the wrap-up meeting of the ICR mission, the
Borrower and the mission reviewed and discussed the results of the indicators reported in the Data
Sheet . In addition, the Borrower prepared a comprehensive final evaluation report in French,
which did not contain a summary. A summary of the Borrower's final report is presented in Annex
7 in English. The Borrower's final evaluation report is available from the Project Files.

                                                                                                    24
110. The revised ICRR was sent to the Borrower for comments, which were received on
November 28, 2011. The Borrower confirmed that: (i) it agreed with the conclusions of the report;
(ii) its observations and concerns view expressed at the wrap-up meeting had been taken into
account; and (iii) it had no specific additional comments.
111.   (b) Co-financing: Not applicable
112. (c) Other partners and stakeholders: The French Development Agency (Agence
Française de Développement) financed the Common Fund from the start of the project; the Spanish
Development Agency joined in 2010, and GAVI and UNICEF joined in 2011.
113. The Spanish Development Agency (AECIS) submitted comments on November 25, 2011
which were joined in by the Agence Française de Développement (AFD) on November 28, 2011.
The comments: (i) noted the encouraging results; and (ii) expressed concern about the financial
risks described in the report and the Bank's (temporary) absence from the Common Fund. The
comments took issue with the criticisms of: (i) the partner response in approving the annual action
plan; and (ii) the Bank's role in supervision. The text was revised to address these concerns.

     Investments to the tune of FCFA 164 347 533 have been made in strengthening the capacity of
the MSP framework through grants of specialization: (i) 28 doctors in obstetrics and gynecology,
general surgery, anesthesia, etc… and (ii) 31 paramedics in gynecology and obstetrics, anesthesia
and radiology. Added to this is support for the implementation of annual plans for short-term
training (inside and outside the country) in the areas of reproductive health (SONU, SONUC,
PF ...) ; financial management and procurement, the management district.

3.  Extension services and provision of a minimum package of activities (MPA)
    Supply management of medical supplies and essential drugs. Investments to the tune of
3,351,467,415 FCFA were made in staffing of health facilities in essential generic drugs, reagents,

                                                                                                 27
contraceptives, vaccines and ARVs. The amount of these investments is distributed as follows: (i)

estimates the cost of free education; and (iii) the performance audit system free.
Strengthening community participation. The project supported the efforts of the MOH in: (i) the
establishment and / or renewal of structures of participation and training of members, (ii) the
financial audit management committees (COGES).

5.  Fight against Malaria
    As conditionality of funding, a national plan to fight against malaria has been achieved. In
addition, funding for the Malaria Booster Program has enabled the acquisition:
     equipment and supplies as part of vector control (520 motorized backpack sprayers, dusters
        10, 16 fog generators, and 600 kits to protect staff in place in eight regions and 42 health
        districts;
     of 30 000 kg of 2% Diflubenzuron GR to treat the breeding of malaria mosquitoes in 38
        Health Districts in the country.
     equipment, consumables and reagents for the laboratory of Entomology of the NMCP to
        conduct entomological studies on malaria vectors;
     549,760 doses of ACTs that have served to support the 230 760 cases of uncomplicated
        malaria in children under 5 years, 195,000 children aged 5 to 9 years and 124 000 adults;
     antimalarial drugs;
     • 250,000 mosquito nets impregnated with long-acting (LLINs) for which 42 DS 5000 and
        DS LLINs by a security stock of 40,000 LLINs at the NMCP for the management and
        response to epidemics and social mobilization activities;
     121,687 tablets of Deltamethrin 25% WT 121 687 for impregnating mosquito nets of
        simple across the country to enhance quality and further reduce the host-vector contact
    Funding for the Booster Program has also enabled:
    training of 150 technicians of Hygiene and Sanitation techniques PID, treatment of breeding
       sites and treatment of mosquito nets, 70 laboratory technicians laboratory diagnosis of
       malaria cases, and 1000 agents care providers were trained to the correct management of
       malaria cases, and
    operational research including: a study in malariometric three epidemiological strata of
       Niger (2008), a study to assess the susceptibility of vectors to insecticides in four health
       districts of the country (2009), a study for the laboratory confirmation of cases of Malaria
       during high and low transmission in 13 Health Districts (2009), a study to assess the
       effectiveness of ACT in sentinel sites NMCP (2010)

Annex 3: Economic and Financial Analysis

1. The economic and financial analysis in the PAD summarized the macroeconomic context and
then focused on the sources of health sector funding, noting:

      the importance of external sources of public funding of the health sector, including nearly
       95% for investment expenditure;
      the effects of the introduction of cost recovery schemes in the 1990s, which initially resulted
       in a decline in the use of health services, but helped to mobilize new resources amounting to
       nearly 2 billion CFA in 2002 (and which were used mostly to purchase drugs); and
      the importance of debt relief for the government budget which facilitated the funding of
       health infrastructure as well as the payment of salaries of community health workers
       beginning in 2004.

2. The analysis pointed out the difficulties of managing both operational and programmatic
expenditures given the different sources of funds and procedures for executing disbursements.

3. Over the life of the project, the ratios of the various sources of health sector expenditures varied
from year to year, but overall external sources accounted for about two-thirds of sector expenditures.

4. The analysis then used the high growth scenario to estimate the projected financial resources
which could be mobilized for the health sector over the period 2005-09; these estimates are
presented below and compared with the actual amounts expended during the period:

4. Though the Government was not able (as shown previously) to sustain certain indicators of
financial performance (health expenditures as a proportion of GDP and as a proportion of the
Government budget), on balance a significant and consistent level of expenditures was mobilized
and expended over the period.

5. The annex also addressed the question of whether the poor benefited from the economic growth
of the years previous to the project (and by extension the question of whether they did during and

                                                                                                   30
after the project as well). The DHS scheduled for 2012 should contribute to answering this question,
but since the vast majority of the population is poor and indicators have clearly improved, it would
seem reasonable to conclude that the poor have benefited.

6. The PAD did not address the issue of efficiency in the expenditure of these mobilized financial
resources, but three measures of efficiency were used to assess the use of these resources: (i)
allocative efficiency, (ii) technical efficiency, and (iii) productive efficiency.
Allocative efficiency is achieved when resources are allocated so as to maximize the welfare of the
community, and the project financed services which: (i) focused on the rural areas where the vast
majority of the population continues to live; (ii) emphasized the most vulnerable groups who are
women and children; and (ii) addressed those barriers which reduce physical and financial access to
these services. Utilization rates for these target groups increased substantially at the same time that
mortality rates for these same target groups were rapidly declining.

6. Technical efficiency is achieved when given resources are used to maximum advantage, and
the project emphasized the most effective interventions for: (i) the sector as a whole (e.g.,
rehabilitating and staffing existing health facilities, expanding the minimum package of essential
services); and (ii) for target groups in particular, namely women (prenatal care, malaria prevention,
assisted delivery and emergency obstetric care, contraceptives) and children (vaccination, malaria
prevention, treatment of malnutrition). Given that overall health expenditures from all sources have
remained roughly stable over the period 2005-10 (as seen in the following table), the project
achieved substantial technical efficiency.

                 Total annual health expenditures (millions CFA)
                         2005      2006      2007      2008        2009     2010
Annual expenditures     53 610    62 391     58 306    55 682      57 682   68 200


7. Productive efficiency is achieved when a health outcome is maximized for a given cost (or the
cost is minimized for a given outcome), and the project expected sector-wide management to: (i)
increase the transparency and coordination in sector financing; (ii) strengthen planning and
budgeting techniques to focus on priorities; and (iii) lower transaction costs of implementation by
harmonizing procedures and decentralizing disbursements., etc.); and (ii) technical efficiencies (to
to focus, to introduce performance-based management, etc.). Productive efficiency was only
modest, for two reasons:

         • The long preparation and delayed approval of the annual action plans by the Common
         Fund partners postponed implementation from January to February/March or even later
         (NB, the Bank made provisions to finance key activities in anticipation of the later
         approval). Preparation and execution of the procurement plan suffered from these delays,
         and though the transfer of funds from central to district level was rapid, the accounts were
         closed at the end of November, reducing the annual implementation period to 8 or 9
         months.
         • Though there were annually repeated efforts to prioritize activities in the Annual
         Action Plan, regions routinely planned 600 or more activities per year. The proportion of
         planned activities in the AAP which were actually implemented was routinely between 50-
         60%, as shown in the following table:


                                                                                                    31

8. On efficiency measures, the project is rated substantial with respect to allocative efficiency,
substantial with respect to technical efficiency, modest with respect to productive efficiency, and
Substantial overall. Related to the PDOs, the project was rated substantial with respect to PDO 1,
modest with respect to PDO 2, and Substantial overall.

Annex 7: Summary of Borrower's ICR and/or Comments on Draft ICR

1. The Government’s ICR was received by the Bank during the ICR mission and discussed during
the wrap-up meeting. Following the outline suggested previously by the Task Team, the report
addresses: (i) the context for program implementation; (ii) the factors which helped and hindered
program implementation; (iii) the administrative, technical, and financial results; (iv) the
appreciation of the performance of the program, the Government, and the Bank; and (vi) lessons
learned and future perspectives.
2. The context briefly summarizes the details of the project (approval date, amount, etc.) as well
as the objectives and components; these correspond to the information presented elsewhere in this
ICR. The report provides a succinct summary of the implementation, describing
          the essential documents: the credit agreement (IDA) and the financing convention
           (AFD); the memorandum of understanding, and the manuals (administrative procedures
           and implementation modalities;
          the structures established at central, regional, and district levels to oversee program
           implementation;
          the summary of the roles and responsibilities of the Secretary General (SG); the
           Directorate for Resource Management (DRFM), which manages the special account; and
           the other Ministry entities at all levels, which benefit from the program; and
          the mechanisms for supervision comprising: monitoring and evaluation indicators;
           internal and external audits (financial and technical), joint supervision missions, and
           mid-term and final evaluations.
3. Among those factors most favorable for the implementation of the program were: (i) a strong
political commitment (especially, the Poverty Reduction Strategy, the President’s Special Program
for the social sectors, and the National Health Development Plan); (ii) the guiding orientations of
the Paris Declaration for harmonizing development assistance; (iii) the reform programs in progress
(for decentralization, public finance and procurement); and (iv) a series of initiatives and
innovations introduced in the health sector (e.g., free health services, performance and other
incentives for health staff).
4. Among those factors hindering implementation of the program were: (i) unforeseen political
difficulties (insecurity in the North, the 2009 coûp, occasional interference of local officials, etc.)
and epidemics (the emergence of bird flu, the persistence of polio); (ii) slow progress in
harmonizing and lengthy delays in implementing procedures among the different partners; (iii) the
fragility of mobilizing public finances (with a continuing dependence on external financing in the
context of a worldwide economic crisis) and controlling their use; and (iv) persistent socio-cultural
obstacles.
5. The different results of the program, which are presented in detail in the Government’s ICR,
have not been summarized here as they have been utilized in the preparation of the data sheet and
provide the basis for Annexes X, Y, and Z of the ICR. Among the implementation difficulties
noted by the Government are: (i) those related to national and sectoral concerns; and (ii) those
linked to the program (in general and with respect to the malaria component):
          National/sectoral concerns: (i) security issues (especially in the north); (ii) problems in
           the management of health personnel (benefits and incentives, mobility, etc.); and (iii)

                                                                                                    36
           priority given to national vaccination campaigns sometimes to the detriment of other
           activities;
          Program concerns: (i) difficulties in preparing the Annual Action Plans (PAA) linked to
           the calendar, the lack of consistent unit costs, the underestimation of activity costs, etc.;
           (ii) delays in approving the PAA leading to delays (2-3 months) in funding the approved
           activities; and (iii) lengthy procurement procedures; and
          Malaria component concerns: (i) difficulties in the procurement of an appropriate
           insecticide for intra-domiciliary spraying; (ii) organization of decentralized campaigns
           for treatment of mosquito breeding sites and bed nets; and (iii) insufficient quantity of
           rapid diagnostic tests for malaria resulting in a high number of cases treated without
           confirmation.
6. In assessing the performance of the project/program, the Government, and the Bank, the ICR
presents the following conclusions:
          Project performance. It was noted that: (i) all contractual obligations (in the AFD
           convention and the IDA credit agreement) with respect to procurement and financial
           management were successfully discharged, as noted in the FMR and the annual audits;
           (ii) the quality of the PAA improved considerably as a result of the ability of health staff
           at the different levels to allocate and plan activities; (iii) the principal objectives of the
           project were achieved; and (iv) the results (technical and managerial) of the program
           have attracted other partners interested in joining (at least partially) the Common Fund.
          Government performance. It was noted that: (i) important efforts were made to provide
           a legal context for the initiatives related to free health care and incentives; (ii) significant
           expenditures were made to rehabilitate, equip, and staff (with appropriate and regularly
           paid personnel) the health facilities; and (iii) commitments to regularly review, monitor,
           and evaluate the project were respected.
          Bank performance. In addition to the Bank’s financial contribution, the Bank’s role in
           procurement and in facilitating sector dialogue was also noted.
7. Among the lessons learned, it was noted that: (i) flexible financing was significant in helping to
respond to the sector’s needs, to enhance the Ministry’s leadership of the sector, and to strengthen
the linkages between resource management and performance at all levels; and (ii) adoption of a
Common Fund could have both macro results (attracting other partners to join) and micro results
(enhancing the decentralization, utilization, and equity of resources).
8. Among the perspectives, the report noted: (i) the enhanced framework for cooperation,
including the revision of the National Health Development (2011-15), the adoption of the Compact,
and AFD’s commitment to continue financing the Common Fund; (ii) the Government’s announced
commitments to reform (creation of a Social Fund for free care, reform of the pharmaceutical
sector) and increased sector financing (eg., 1600 staff are to be recruited in 2012); and (iii) the
continuing initiatives to strengthen the delivery of health services (cases de santé) and the
measurement of the results (improved MIS and surveillance).

Annex 8: Comments of Co-financing partners and Other Partners/Stakeholders

1. The French Development Agency (Agence Française de Développement) financed the
Common Fund from the start of the project; the Spanish Development Agency joined in 2010, and
GAVI and UNICEF joined in 2011.

2. The Spanish Development Agency (AECIS) submitted comments on November 25, 2011
which were joined in by the Agence Française de Développement (AFD) on November 28, 2011.
The comments: (i) noted the encouraging results; and (ii) expressed concern about the financial
risks described in the report and the Bank’s (temporary) absence from the Common Fund. The
comments took issue with the criticisms of: (i) the partner response in approving the annual action
plan; and (ii) the Bank’s role in supervision. The text was revised to address these concerns.
