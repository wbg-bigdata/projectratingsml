INTERNATIONAL BANK FOR RECONSTRUCTION AND DEVELOPMENT
REPORT AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT
TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS ON A
PROPOSED LOAN TO ELEKTROPRIVREDA,
BOSNE I HERCEGOVINE-SARAJEVO
WITH THE GUARANTEE OF
THE SOCIALIST FEDERAL REPUBLIC OF YUGOSLAVIA
1.        I submit the following report and recommendation on a proposed loan
to Elektroprivreda, Bosne i Hercegovine-Sarajevo, with the guarantee of the
Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia, for the equivalent of US$70.0 mil-
lion to help finance a hydroelectric power project. The loan would have a
term of 25 years, including five years of grace, with interest at 8-1/2 per-
cent per annum. A substantial portion of the loan would be made available to
Hidroelektrane na Drini-Sarajevo, the organization entrusted with the construc-
tion of the power facilities, on the same terms as the Bank loan.
PART I - THE ECONOMY
2.        A basic economic mission visited Yugoslavia in November 1972; its
report entitled "The Economic Development of Yugoslavia" (R74-1) was distri-
buted to the Executive Directors on January 2, 1974. An economic updating
mission visited the country in October 1974 and its findings are reflected
in this report. Basic data on the economy are given in Annex I.
Economic Trends and Development Issues
3.        The Yugoslav economy has experienced rapid growth and significant
structural change during the past two decades. GDP at constant prices in-
creased by about 5.5 percent per year and per capita GDP by over 4.5 percent
per year. Average per capita GDP is estimated at around US$900 (1973). The
number of people engaged in agriculture has decreased both absolutely and as
a percentage of the labor force, while the number engaged in industry and
services has correspondingly increased. However nearly half of the labor
force is still engaged in agriculture, most of it on small private farms.
Industry accounts for 23 percent and services for 22 percent of the labor
force.
4.        Two important features of the economy have been strengthened by the
recent constitutional changes. Self-management, whereby the means of produc-
tion used by different workers' collectives are given to them to manage, has
emerged as the fundamental right and obligation of every basic unit of orga-
nized labor in whatever sector. Second, the responsibility for most important
economic and social policy decisions has been delegated to the Republics and
Provinces. Against this background, Yugoslavia has placed increasing reliance
on the market mechanism and the opening-up of the economy to international
trade.



- 2 -
5.        The leading role in economic and social development has been played
by the social sector, which includes government, most enterprises and institu-
tions such as libraries, hospitals, theatres and schools, and which accounts
for 85 percent of GDP and employs over half of the total labor force. All
the enterprises and institutions are under workers' self-management and re-
sources are under social ownership. There is a private sector predominantly
comprised of peasant farms (with a 10 hectare limit on land holdings) and
small enterprises (with a 5 person limit on the number of non-family workers),
mainly in handicrafts, construction, trade, transport and tourism. In the
past the private sector has been relatively neglected by government policy.
However, the government has lately been devoting more attention to private
farmers with a view to accelerating the growth of agricultural production.
6.        Despite a policy of fostering accelerated growth in the less-
developed regions, major differences persist in the levels of development
among Republics. The more-developed regions are located in the north and
include 65 percent of the population. But even this area includes sizeable
pockets of poverty, particularly in private agriculture. The less-developed
regions are in the south and are generally more mountainous and less densely
populated. Thiis makes agriculture and transportation more difficult. The
southern regions are rich in minerals, coal and hydropower generating poten-
tial. The development of these resources has provided the major stimulus for
growth.
7.        Although the economy of the less-developed regions has been growing
at almost the same rate as the more advanced areas, per capita income has
lagged behind because of faster population growth (1.6 percent per year as
compared with 0.7 percent in the more-developed regions). Consequently,
regional inequalities have widened. Average per capita GDP in the less-
developed regions now amounts to about 50 percent of that of the rest of the
country. Yugoslavia's development policy aims at reducing regional inequal-
ities by transferring investment funds from the more advanced to the less-
developed regions. In 1972 these transfers amounted to almost US$300 mil-
lion, about one-third of the less-developed regions' total investment ex-
penditure.
8.        In addition to significant regional income differences there are
substantial sectoral income differences. For example, per capita GDP in pri-
vate agriculture in Kosovo (by far the poorest region), is just over US$100
or about one-ninth of the national average. Many private farmers there sup-
plement their incomes by working in the social sector but are, nevertheless,
unable to maintain an adequate standard of living. Although incomes in pri-
vate agriculture are somewhat higher in other parts of the country, they re-
main far below those obtaining in non-agricultural activities.
9.        Thus far, the employment situation in Yugoslavia has remained man-
ageable not least because of the sizeable temporary migration abroad which,
since 1972 has stabilized at a level of about 1.1 million. Open unemployment
was estimated to be around 3.5 percent of the resident active population in



-3-
mid-1974, and in the private agricultural sector there was severe underem-
ployment. There is considerable public concern about the size and composi-
tion of the emigrant labor force. The Government expects that the economy
has now reached a level and momentum of development which should create an
annual increase of domestic employment exceeding the natural increase in
the labor force and policies are being introduced to encourage the return
of skilled and educated workers and those who have been abroad for some
time. However, due to an economic slowdown in major recipient countries,
job opportunities abroad may decline and migrant workers may return faster
than intended with potentially negative effects on domestic unemployment
and on the balance of payments.
Recent Developments
10.       Rapid economic growth since 1968 was accompanied by inflation and
balance of payments problems. Many enterprises experienced financial diffi-
culties primarily as a result of over-zealous investment programs and a lack
of financial discipline. To counter inflation and improve the external pay-
ments position, the Government, in 1972 and 1973, adopted measures aimed at
restricting monetary expansion, limiting public expenditure, temporarily
strengthening price controls, reducing the growth of personal income, im-
proving the financial structure of enterprises and imposing limitations on
external borrowing. In addition, to neutralize the inflationary pressure on
the balance of payments, the dinar was devalued by 16.6 percent in January
1971, and again by 18.8 percent in December 1971. The dinar has been floating
since July 1973 and on October 29, 1974 the Yugoslav Central Bank established
a new intervention rate of US$1.00 equal to Dinars 17.23, an effective deval-
uation of 7 percent.
11.       As a result of these measures economic growth slowed from 8.8 per-
cent in 1971 to 4.4 percent in 1972 and 5.1 percent in 1973. Exports in-
creased during the same period at significantly higher rates than imports.
Aided by a sharp rise in workers' remittances (up 36 percent in 1972) the
current account showed a surplus of US$419 million in 1972, the first sur-
plus since 1965. A current account surplus was again achieved in 1973 ($464
million). Foreign exchange reserves increased from the equivalent of about
one month's merchandise imports in 1971, to nearly 4 months by the end of
1973. There was no slowdown in the rate of inflation, however, and most
prices continued to rise at the rate of 15-20 percent per year through 1973.
12.       In 1974 economic growth picked up again (reaching an estimated an-
nual rate of 7 percent). This higher growth rate was accompanied by a recur-
rence of the difficulties associated with rapid growth, further amplified by
the changes in the international trade situation. The pace of inflation
accelerated and the annual rate of increase in the leading indicator--the
overall producer price index--rose to approximately 30 percent. Liquidity
problems in enterprises associated with the rapid increase of the invest-
ment rate began to reappear. The balance of payments deteriorated due to
the coincidence of worsening terms of trade, slow growth of commodity ex-
ports to countries in the convertible currency area, and stagnation of real



- 4 -
net exports of invisibles. As a result, a current account deficit of about
$1 billion is estimated for 1974.
13.       The Social Development Plan for 1971-75 projected an average GDP
growth of 7.5 percent per year in real terms but it is clear that this will
not be realized. Even if economic growth in the last two years of the period
reached that level, average growth during the five years would amount to
around 6.8 percent, due to the slowdown associated with the 1972/73 stabil-
ization measures. Given the slow population increase this would still be
rather high, and would compare well with growth during the preceding five-
year plan period (4.7 percent per year).
The Energy Sector
14.       On a caloric basis about two-thirds of Yugoslavia's energy needs in
1973 were met from domestic sources. Domestically-mined coal remains an im-
portant source of fuel. Practically all thermal power plants are coal-fired.
About one-third of the oil consumed is of domestic origin. Yugoslavia gen-
erates more than half of its electricity from hydro plants despite the fact
that only about 30 percent of its hydropower potential has been developed.
The shortages of electricity that are emerging are not due to the lack of
hydro generation potential, coal or oil, but rather to insufficient plant
capacity and delayed construction. National energy policy emphasizes maximum
development of domestic resources to curb the need for imported energy.
Federal agencies are preparing studies to coordinate this development for
the most efficient use of resources.
15.       In spite of Yugoslavia's relatively low dependence on imported oil,
increases in the price of oil are bound to affect the government's efforts
to improve the external payments position. In 1973 oil imports amounted to
US$259 million, or 6 percent of commodity imports. For 1974 oil import pay-
ments were of the order of US$900 million, at an average c.i.f. price of
US$100 per metric ton - m.t. (US$13 per barrel), equivalent to about 13 per-
cent of imports of goods and services. The impact on the balance of payments
has been to contribute to a substantial current account deficit in 1974, which
will continue in later years, instead of the surpluses Yugoslavia has enjoyed
recently.
16.       The indirect consequences of the world energy crisis are unclear.
On the positive side the availability of coal and hydropower resources should
improve the country's international competitive position, although their de-
velopment would require heavy investment with long gestation periods. On the
other hand job opportunities for Yugoslavs working abroad may diminish as eco-
nomic growth in Western Europe slows down. Returning migrant workers would
exacerbate unemployment and housing problems and workers' remittances, which
have played a dynamic role in the economy, may suffer. Moreover, stagnation
in economic activity abroad could affect Yugoslavia's exports. Although the
rise in the cost of automobile and air transportation might unfavorably in-
fluence tourism, preliminary 1974 data showing foreign tourist visits slightly



- 5 -
below 1973 and foreign exchange earnings equal to 1973 indicate that there
has not been a serious decline. These conflicting trends are being watched
carefully by the Yugoslav authorities and the Bank.
Capital Requirements
17.       Yugoslavia is dependent to a large degree on imported equipment for
its economic development and the country has borrowed substantial amounts
abroad. Gross capital inflows have more than tripled during the last five
years, reaching US$1,186 million in 1973, mostly in medium-term commercial
credit. Ilowever, due to rapidly rising amortization payments, an increase
of US$746 million in gross inflows between 1967 and 1972 resulted in an in-
crease in the net inflow of only US$224 million. The growing discrepancy
between gross and net inflows reflects a shift, following the 1965 Economic
Reforms, from long-term official loans to medium-term commercial credits as
a result of the limited availability of official capital and the liberaliza-
tion of foreign trade and borrowing. The United States, the Federal Republic
of Germany, Switzerland, Italy and the United Kingdom have provided most of
the commercial credits. IBRD, the Federal Republic of Germany, and the USSR
have been the principal sources of long-term official capital.
18.       Until recently it was thought that much of the foreign exchange
needed to finance imports would come from the growth of exports of goods and
invisibles. However, the energy crisis and other factors make it doubtful
whether this source will continue to expand at its previous high rate and the
country will, therefore, need to maintain a high level of foreign borrowing.
Its gross medium- and long-term capital requirements are tentatively estimated
at between US$2.0 and 2.5 billion per year during 1974-79. Around US$500-600
million of this may be provided in the form of official development assistance
from bilateral and multilateral sources. The remainder will come mainly from
foreign banks and suppliers. Raising such large sums will be a formidable
challenge, but Yugoslavia's success in the past in obtaining the funds it
requires from the capital markets, and its continued good credit standing,
give grounds for confidence that it will be able to obtain the capital in-
flow required to finance its development efforts.
Creditworthiness
19.       In spite of the present unsettled international conditions, the
prospects for Yugoslavia's continued economic growth during the next decade
are good. The country's endowment of natural and human resources, its rela-
tively low dependence on imported energy sources, its pragmatic approach to
economic problems and its readiness to undertake institutional changes, com-
bine to give grounds for a favorable assessment of future prospects.
20.       External public and publicly-guaranteed debt outstanding as of
December 31, 1973 was US$1,912 million. In addition there was US$2,407 mil-
lion non-public external debt outstanding. Total (public and non-public) debt
service payments in 1973 were equivalent to 13.5 percent of foreign exchange
earnings including workers' remittances. With external borrowing projected
at around US$2 billion per year during 1974-76 with a rising trend, the debt



- 6 -
service ratio (public and non-public) is expected to gradually increase over
the next few years. Taking into account Yugoslavia's debt service record and
the measures taken in the past to control balance of payments problems, as
well as the prospective growth of production and foreign exchange earnings,
Yugoslavia remains creditworthy for a substantial amount of Bank lending.
21.       Many of the high priority projects in Yugoslavia have a low foreign
exchange component due to the relatively advanced state of Yugoslav industry
and the competitiveness of Yugoslav contractors. Were the Bank to confine
its lending to the foreign exchange costs of projects, an adequate contribu-
tion to Yugoslavia's external capital needs could be made only by spreading
the lending over a large number of projects, including some of lesser prior-
ity. Therefore it seems reasonable to provide for some measure of local ex-
penditure financing in the Bank's lending program.
PART II - BANK GROUP OPERATIONS IN YUGOSLAVIA
22.       The Bank has made 32 loans totalling about US$1,021 million to
Yugoslavia. Of this amount approximately 50 percent (US$531.4 million) hias
been for 12 loans for the transportation sector - six for highways totalling
US$180 million, four for railways totalling US$248 million, US$59.4 million
for the Naftagas pipeline and $44 million for the Port of Bar Project. Bank
lending has generally concentrated on infrastructure including, in addition
to the transportation loans, power (three loans totalling US$135 million),
telecommunications (one loan for US$40 million), three multipurpose projects
totalling US$103 million and US$6 million for the Dubrovnik Water Supply and
Wastewater project. Nine loans have also been made for industry, two for
tourism and one for agricultural industries. This would be the fourth in
the electric power sector (the first two were for hydropower projects in
1961 and 1962, and the third was for a power transmission project in 1972).
IFC has made eight investments in Yugoslavia totalling about US$80 million.
23.       In the past few years delays in loan effectiveness have hampered
project implementation. To some extent delays are inevitable since the
clearance of loan documents involves all the Republics and Provinces in every
case. Thus conditions of effectiveness can rarely be met speedily regardless
of how well the ground is prepared. Following the adoption of a new constitu-
tion last year, the Federal Government is drawing up plans for revised pro-
cedures which would simplify the loan ratification process and enable project
implementation to get underway more quickly. In the meantime steps have been
taken to speed up the existing clearance procedure. All six loans approved
in FY74 and the first approved in FY75 have been declared effective and dis-
bursements have started on all of them. Disbursements generally have picked
up substantially and have been running at a rate in excess of $100 million per
annum over the past six months. There have been delays in the execution of
several projects particularlv the Belgrade-Bar Railway project and the
Bernardin and Babin Kuk tourism projects. Annex II contains a summary state-
ment of Bank loans and IFC investments as of March 31, 1974 and notes on the
execution of on-going projects.



- 7 -
24.       The major objectives of Bank lending to Yugoslavia are to accelerate
development in the less-developed regions of the country; to promote agricul-
tural development, particularly among the small private farmers by providing
basic infrastructure and credit for the financing of farm development, equip-
ment and processing facilities; to promote structural reforms in major sectors
of the economy through improved coordination and the strengthening of institu-
tions; and to provide Yugoslavia with long-term external capital and thus
help reduce the country's dependence on short-term external borrowings. These
objectives are basically the same as those which have guided Bank lending in
previous years, but efforts to give special support to the less-developed re-
gions and the small farmers are being strengthened.
25.       Over the next two years loans envisaged for less developed areas
include the present proposal, urban (air and water) pollution control and
two major multipurpose projects. Highway, railway, power transmission and
oil pipeline projects will both assist the less-developed regions and pro-
mote structural reforms in the transport and energy sectors. A high prior-
ity agriculture credit project will assist small private farmers as well as
social sector enterprises throughout the country. IFC is currently investi-
gating several new investment opportunities to encourage joint ventures which
would provide technical, management and marketing expertise as well as long-
term capital.
26.       In addition to substantial assistance given in identifying and pre-
paring projects for Bank financing, the Bank is providing technical assistance
in several areas. A series of regional studies of the four less-developed re-
gions of Yugoslavia was initiated two years ago and two studies, covering
Kosovo and Bosnia-Herzegovina, have been completed. A third study, of
Macedonia, was carried out last month. This series, when completed, will
contribute to better assessment of development programs and will assist in
formulating development strategies for these regions. Other current activi-
ties include assistance with a study on the Yugoslav capital market designed
to help improve resource mobilization and allocation, and assistance for a
training program for auditors of the Social Accounting Service which audits
all enterprises and Government activities, including Bank financed projects.
Assistance from EDT, as well as the Bank, has been directed towards the im-
provement of project evaluation; this objective is also implicit in most
Bank loans to Yugoslavia.
27.       The level of Bank lending to Yugoslavia has risen substantially
and is expected to average about US$200 million annually during the period
FY74 to FY76. Although this represents only a small proportion of the
country's need for external finance, it would be equivalent to almost one-
third of the annual long-term official capital inflow in convertible curren-
cies. Even assuming that the level of Bank lending rises during the next
five years, the outstanding debt to the Bank would remain about 10 percent of
Yugoslavia's total external debt. Service on Bank loans as a proportion of
total debt service would increase from 3.2 percent in 1973 to 4.8 percent
in 1976.



-8-
PART III - THE ELECTRIC POWER SECTOR
28.       In recent years the generation of electric power has not kept pace
with demand in Yugoslavia. In 1974 the shortfall was estimated to have been
about 1.8 billion kilowatt hours (kWh) or about 5-6 percent of total require-
ments. Shortages of 3-5 percent of energy required are expected to prevail
until 1977/78. Industrial consumption accounts for half the total demand and
suffers the most from the shortages. There are also regional and seasonal
imbalances in the supply and demand due to the organization of the sector.
Construction of new generating capacity has lagged because of the shortage
of investment funds. Low cost Federal funds which had been available in the
1950s and 1960s permitted low electricity tariffs to prevail. Tariffs have
only recently been increased and, along with local legislation providing for
power sector investment funds, are now beginning to finance an expanded con-
struction program.
Potential for Expansion
29.       Yugoslavia has great potential for expanding electric power genera-
tion. Hydropower potential is estimated at 64 billion kWh per year. At
present only about 30 percent of this is developed. The potential for thermal
power production is even greater. Brown coal reserves are estimated at 3.4
billion m.t. and production in 1973 was only 9.1 million m.t. Lignite re-
serves are estimated at 18.1 billion m.t. (1973 production was 22.7 million
m.t.). The lignite reserves are especially attractive for thermal power gen-
eration because they are easily strip mined and, due to their low calorific
value, their energy is most economically transported through conversion to
electric power. Thermal power will be developed more rapidly than hydro-
power and by 1990 will provide about 76 percent of the nation's total power
needs compared with 46 percent in 1972.
30.       Installed generating capacity of the country's bulk suppliers, which
provide over 90 percent of all power, is expected to grow from 8 million kilo-
watts (kW) in 1973 to about 19 million kW in 1980. Electricity sales are ex-
pected to increase from 29.4 billion kWh in 1973 to 67 billion kWh in 1980
and 100 billion kWH in 1985. Per capita consumption of electricity will
grow from 1,600 kWh in 1973 to 4,600 in 1985 (comparable to consumption in
the United Kingdom in 1971).
Organization
31.       The power sector is organized, as are other sectors, on the prin-
ciples of workers' self-management. Power plants and other independently
viable entities are Basic Organizations of Associated Labor (BOALs), the
basic level of workers' organization. BOALs commonly, and voluntarily, join
together in Work Organizations to better coordinate their activities over a
larger geographic area. The power organizations in the country are broadly
divided into generation/transmission and distribution subsectors. The gene-
raLsDn and transmission enterprises are required to join the Union of Yugos-
lav Electric Power Industry (JUGEL). JUGEL coordinates the major aspects



of power generation and transmission in the country, but has no executive
authority over its members. Some of the major distribution enterprises have
joined JUGEL and others are expected to do so.
32.       Because of its decentralized organization the power sector has
developed on a local and regional basis. The Bank is encouraging integra-
tion of the sector through development of a 380-kV transmission system that
will provide a country-wide electricity grid (Loan 836-YU, June 23, 1972).
The grid will help eliminate imbalances in supply and demand due to consumers
and suppliers being geographically remote (population is heaviest in the
north, while power generation capacity is concentrated in the south). It will
also help smooth out seasonal variations due to differences in the rainfall
patterns in major hydropower producing areas.
33.       There was little coordinated planning of future investments from
1965 to 1972. Each power enterprise had its own plan and these were aggre-
gated by Republic and Province. In connection with the Power Transmission
Loan, JUGEL prepared a study on the "Development of Electric Power Production
in Yugoslavia, 1972 to 1980". The study forecast supply and demand and
identified needed investments but did not provide priority ranking or identify
financial resources; matters which are the responsibility of JUGEL's members
rather than JUGEL itself.  With Bank encouragement, a least cost development
plan identifying the investment priorities is now being prepared.
Financing Electric Power Development
34.       Until 1962 the Federal Government provided the bulk of electric
power development funds through long-term, low-interest loans. In connection
with the general decentralization of economic activity, enterprises, republics
and local governments provided an increasing share of investment funds for
new plant construction between 1962 and 1970. After January 1, 1971, Federal
funds for power investments were no longer available. The access to long-
term, low-interest credit in the 1950s and 1960s had allowed low tariff rates
to prevail and, when such credit was no longer available, power enterprises
were unable to finance expansion because of their low rate of internal cash
generation. Construction of new power plants fell behind the growing demand
for electricity.
35.       Since 1972, tariffs rates have been increasing and this situation
has been steadily improving. Under Loan 836, it was agreed that tariffs would
be set sufficiently high, or other forms of consumer payment (e.g. connection
charges) would be arranged, to enable enterprises to generate incomes to pro-
vide 35 percent of the funds required for new investment from their own
resources. The balance of needed financing was expected to come from foreign
loans (development assistance and commercial credits), local bank loans and
special resources raised by republic and local governments.

PART IV - THE PROJECT
36.       The project is part of a long-range plan for developing the hydro-
power resources of the Drina River in Bosnia-Herzegovina, one of the less-
developed Republics in Yugoslavia. It was selected for Bank consideration
from among 12 high priority power projects submitted by the Federal Govern-
ment in 1973 (see para. 58). It was appraised in September/October 1974.
Negotiations were held in March 1975 in Washington.    The Yugoslav Delegation
was led by Mr. Miodrag Stojiljkovic, Assistant Federal Secretary for Finance,
and included representatives of the Socialist Republic of Bosnia-Herzegovina,
Elektroprivreda Bosne i Hercegovine-Sarajevo and Hidroelektrane na Drini-
Sarajevo.
Project Description
37.       The project is summarized in Annex III and described in detail in
the report entitled "Appraisal of the Buk Bijela Hydropower Project," No. 650a-
YU and dated April 22, 1975 which is being distributed separately. It would
consist of construction of the 450-MW Buk Bijela hydropower station on the
Drina River, including a rock fill dam with clay core, spillways, intakes and
pressure tunnels, a cavern-type power house with four 11.2-MW turbogenerators,
accessory equipment and a switchyard. A compensating reservoir with a con-
crete dam would be constructed 10 km downstream to regulate discharge waters.
Consulting services would be provided for assistance with administration,
accounting and training and for special engineering studies.
Project Execution
38.       The construction of the power station would be the responsibility
of Hidroelektrane na Drini-Sarajevo (Drina). Drina is an organization "under
foundation", i.e. one that is in the process of creating assets which will
be taken over by a Basic Organization of Associated Labor when they begin
earning revenue. Drina's founder is Elektroprivreda and the workers of Drina
share its management with representatives of Elektroprivreda. Drina's func-
tions, rights and obligations will be identified in a contract that it will
sign with Elektroprivreda. The execution and delivery of the contract, satis-
factory to the Bank, would be a condition of effectiveness of the proposed
loan (Loan Agreement, Section 7.01 e).
39.       Drina has been established not only to construct the Buk Bijela
power plant but also to prepare and carry out a program to develop the full
hydropower resources of the Drina River in Bosnia-Herzegovina. Upon comple-
tion of Buk Bijela, it is expected that a cadre of workers from Drina will
form a BOAL to assume the assets and operate the plant, while Drina would
move on to the construction of the next plant in the program. It has been
agreed that any such transfer of assets shall occur under arrangements
satisfactory to the Bank (Project Agreement, Section 5.04).



40.       In  view of Drina's status as an organization under foundation and
because it will probably not operate Buk Bijela, Elecktroprivreda has been
selected as the Borrower for the proposed Bank loan. Elektroprivreda is a
Work Organization composed of the seventeen BOALs responsible for bulk power
generation, transmission and supporting services in the Republic of Bosnia-
Herzegovina. Elektroprivreda would act in its own behalf and on behalf of
its constituent Basic Organizations all of which would collectively be the
Borrower. Under its Self-Management Agreement signed December 21, 1973
Elektroprivreda is responsible for power development and operations within
Bosnia-Herzegovina including:
(i) preparation of major power development programs;
(ii) pooling of capital investment funds;
(iii)  determination of the annual and long-term power balance;
(iv) collection and distribution of revenues; and
(v) determination of electricity tariffs (within established
legal ceilings) for the purchase and sale of power.
41.       Elektroprivreda and Drina have agreed that the proceeds of the
Bank Loan (except those allocated for management consultants) would be made
available to Drina by Elektroprivreda under arrangements acceptable to the
Bank (Loan Agreement, Section 3.01 c). The contract to be signed by Elektro-
privreda and Drina will include these arrangements, providing, inter alia,
that the proceeds are made available on the same terms and conditions as the
Bank Loan and that there is adequate provision for Drina, or any other organ-
ization that may assume Buk Bijela's assets, to repay the proceeds, with in-
terest, to the Borrower.
42.       Drina has employed consultants satisfactory to the Bank to prepare
the final design and bid documents, to evaluate the bids and to supervise
construction. Drina has agreed to continue to employ these consultants and,
if necessary, employ special consultants to assist with important geologic
or hydro problems that may arise during construction (Project Agreement, Sec-
tion, 2.02). Final design and bid documents are under preparation. Prelim-
inary civil works in preparation for the major dam construction have also
begun. Construction of the dam is expected to begin by the end of 1975 and
the entire project is expected to be completed by the end of 1979 or early
1980.
Project Cost and Financing
43.       The project is estimated to cost US$242.5 million (excluding inter-
est during construction, but including duties and taxes). The direct foreign
costs are estimated to be US$85.9 million or about 35 percent of total project
cost. Physical and price contingencies would represent about 37 percent of
total cost.



- 12 -
44.       A Bank loan of US$70.0 million is proposed.   It would amount to
about 29 percent of total project cost (excluding interest during construc-
tion) and about 81 percent of foreign costs. The remaining sources of finance
for the project would be loans from industries located in the republic and
surcharges on electricity consumption provided by special legislation of the
Republic of Bosnia-Herzegovina (about 33 percent), the Federal Fund for Credit-
ing Accelerated Development in Economically Insufficiently Developed Republics
and the Autonomous Province of Kosovo (Federal Fund) (about 3 percent) and
Elektroprivreda's internal resources (about 35 percent). The execution of
undertakings satisfactory to the Bank for the provision of the financial con-
tributions to be provided by the special Republican legislation and the inter-
nal resources of the Borrower would be conditions of effectiveness (Loan
Agreement, Recitals C and D, and Section 7.01 (a) and (d)). The availability
of the resources from the Federal Fund have been confirmed to the satisfaction
of the Bank. The Republic has agreed to arrange, through the provisions of
the special legislation, any additional finance that may be required, and a
formal undertaking to this effect would be a condition of effectiveness (Loan
Agreement, Recital D and Section 7.01 (d)).
45.       The Buk Bijela project represents only about 15 percent of Elektro-
privreda's investment program for 1973-80. The estimated total cost of the
program would be about US$1.6 billion. During the construction period of
the Buk Bijela Project (1974-79), the program is expected to be financed from
internal cash generation (33 percent), consumer's contributions (11 percent)
and borrowings (56 percent). The internally generated cash of the constituent
BOALs would be pooled and lent to those executing projects in the program
under the provisions of a special self-management agreement, the execution of
which would be a condition of effectiveness (Loan Agreement, Section 7.01 b).
The Republic has undertaken to take all such measures as may be required to
provide Elektroprivreda with any additional funds that mav be required to
complete the program as scheduled.
46.       In addition to the direct financing, support for the program would
be provided by waiving all income tax payable by generation and transmission
BOALs between 1974 and 1980 and deferring, until the end of 1980, debt service
payments on about 60 percent of the BOALs existing debt (mostly loans from
Government Funds).
47.       Prior to the creation of Elektroprivreda in December 1973, power
generation and transmission in Bosnia-Herzegovina was handled by six enter-
prises. These have now organized themselves into the 17 BOALs comprising
Elektroprivreda. During appraisal, Elektroprivreda prepared financial
statements for 1972 and 1973 by consolidating the statements of the six
former enterprises. The consolidated income accounts show rates of return
of about 5 percent. Electricity sales in 1973 were about 3 percent above
1972 and revenues, because of tariff increases, were 24 percent above 1972.



- 13 -
Tihe revenue increase was sufficient only to meet rising costs due to   nfla-
tion. Depreciation averaged 3.7 percent of gross fixed assets in operation
and interest on debt averaged 3.3 percent. In 1973 gross fixed assets were
valued at about US$400 million and outstanding debt at about US$160 million
(much of which was low-interest, long-term debt). In view of the limited
expansion program in 1972 and 1973, and the favorable terms applying to the
loag-term debt, the 1973 five percent rate of return was satisfactory.
48.       During the period of the expansion program, electricity sales are
expected to increase about 2.6 times.   With expected tariff increases, the
corresponding revenues will increase about 7 times. Total expenditure for
the construction program will increase the value of gross fixed assets in
service to Din 50.5 billion as of December 31, 1980 (adjusted for revaluation
to reflect expected increases in the general level of prices). Total borrow-
ing will increase long-term debt to 6 times the 1973 level but the debt/equity
ratio is expected to improve from 43/57 in 1973 to 38/62 by the end of 1980.
49.       The financial forecasts show a rate of return averaging about 5%.
If the revenue surcharges are included as part of operating income the aver-
age rate of return is about 7.5%. Further, if an adjustment is made for the
accelerated depreciation charged on assets used in two or more shifts the
average rate of return is about 9%. This latter figure represents a reason-
able rate of return and reflects more adequately than the other calculations
the true financial rate of return. The rate of return for the last year of
the period is low (6.5%), largely because of the increases in plant expected
to become operational at that time, but it should not be regarded with concern
in view of the uncertainty about cash needs for future expansion and because
the tariff adjustment mechanism (see para 50) is designed to ensure a reason-
able level of internal funds will be available to meet future expansion. The
forecasts show that Elektroprivreda will finance about 33% of its expansion
needs from internal sources during the construction period of the Project and
34% to 1980.  If the revenue surcharges are included as part of internal cash
generation, the contribution to investment requirements from internal sources
will be 47% - a very adequate level.
50.       To insure that adequate internal funds for future expansion are gen-
erated, the Borrower has agreed (Loan Agreement, Section 5.04) to apply rates
for the sale of power at such levels as shall provide revenues sufficient:
(i)  to cover in any given year, all operating expenses including
employee compensation, depreciation, and interest on debt;
(ii)  to cover, in any given year, debt amortization insofar as it
exceeds depreciation; and
(iii)  to finance, after payment of taxes and other contributions
provided by law, if any, an average of not less than 35 percent
of the cost of investment in power facilitiies including int rest
payable during construction and its working capital requirem.nts,
during any social economic development plan period of the
Guarantor.



Tariff increases -needed to mr eet,ese requtirements would lbe about 15 percent
p.a. in 1975, i`976 a;nd 197`  and. abe 7- 11i/ percen:t in 1978, 1979 and 1980.
(The need for increased. cariffs is weL. ulnderstood in Y""noslavia and, through
national coordination, tariffs thlrouinhout: the comuntry are being increased by
up to 30 percent in 1975.)   Elektroprivreda has also agreed to use its best
efforts to maintain a uniform depreciation policy for its assets consistently
applied from year to year kLoanl AreeTlMenit, Section 5.08).
51.       The Introducticn of new projects or inaeor changes in the 1973-80
construction prograrm would alter these projections and the Borrower has,
therefore, agreed to discuss with the Back any proposaIs for changes result-
ing in a variatiop in cost of the prograim equivalent to 100 million Dinars
(about $6 million) or rmore (Loan Agreement, SectiLon 5,06),
52.       Elekttroprivreda, being a new Work Organization, is still establish-
ing its ranagement system.   Procedures ror consolicatinng the financial state-
ments of the constituent BOALs, and manag,nement. in.formation systemns to provide

Procurement and DIsbursement
53.        Gcnttacts for ecuipmernt and sliuplies woul-d be arwarded on the basis
of internat-on,al competitive bi ddirrng, in accordance with, the Bank Group's
"Guidelines for ProcuremlentC'. A preference of 15 percent or applicable

54.       The cronose,l Boen would finance the foreign cost of part of the con-
struction equlpnent and materials required for the civil works and the cost
of hydro-mechanical and electrical Materials and equipment. In the event
Yugoslav suppliers win the contracts for equipment and materials on which
they are expected to bid, direct fOyreign exchange _expenditures would be re-
duced and a portion of the Bani loart vould bLe di-sbursed in respect of local
currency expenditures-   However, talkien- into account the estimated indirect
foreign costs, principall   for civil wurks, the amnount of the proposed loan
wotuld. still be less than the total forei`gn c.ost of the project.  Disbursements



- 15 -
would be for the c.i.f. cost of imported items or the ex-factory cost of
items supplied under contracts won by Yugoslav manufacturers, and for the cost
of related construction and engineering services, management consultants and
and training. Disbursements would begin in the final quarter of 1975 and be
completed in December 1980.
Environment
55.       The Buk Bijela reservoir and Foca compensating reservoir will dis-
place about 610 persons; cause a road and forest railroad to be relocated;
and, flood some agricultural land, a few buildings and a small power plant.
Agreements have been reached on fair indemnifications for all these disloca-
tions. Ecological effects would be minimal. As there has yet been no study
of possible problems for the fishery resources resulting from the series of
dams proposed for the Drina basin, Elektroprivreda has agreed to arrange such
a study on that portion of the Drina River located within Bosnia-Herzegovina.
It would be carried out in the context of a study of the whole river basin by
local experts under terms of reference acceptable to the Bank. The results
of the study and any actions derived therefrom would be discussed with the
Bank (Loan Agreement, Section 3.06).
Audit
56.       Elektroprivreda's accounts would be audited by the Social Accounting
Service (SAS). With Bank encouragement, the SAS started a program in January
1974 under which its staff are being trained by Coopers and Lybrand of the
U.K. in auditing methods consistent with modern auditing standards. Elektro-
privreda gave the Bank informal assurances that the group of specially train-
ed auditors would be asked to conduct the audit of Elektroprivreda beginning
with the accounts for the year ending December 31, 1976. In the event the
special group cannot perform an audit satisfactory to the Bank, Elektro-
privreda would engage other auditors.
Justification
57.       Yugoslavia's power requirements have not been met in recent years.
Power shortages are currently causing cuts of up to 50 percent of the power
supply in at least two republics - street, public and shop lighting is being
reduced; heating of business and social premises is being curtailed; voltage
is being reduced, and, a 10 percent reduction to all consumers (except where
it would jeopardize the work process) is in effect. Power shortages will
inevitably continue for the next few years and would continue beyond that
period, if large investments in new generation capacity were not made. The
country's long-term development strategy calls for the progressive exploita-
tion of hydropower and lignite resources, supplemented by the introduction
of nuclear power on a growing scale from 1980 onward. Completion of the
interconnected grid is being pursued on a high priority basis and intensive
programs for the construction of power generation facilities are being under-
taken.



- 16 -
58.       In 1973 12 hydro schemes were identified as having priority for
development in the various republics and for Bank financing. Buk Bijela was
selected for Bank assistance because it was located in a less-developed
republic: it would have a high storage capacity (a large reservoir) and high
power capacity and energy capability; and, it would have secondary benefits
in irrigation (water available for irrigation would increase by 7 percent),
flood protection and tourism potential. Buk Bijela would form part of the
interconnected power system of Yugoslavia. Its construction is consistent
with the country's policy of reducing dependence on imported energy by deve-
loping local resources.
59.       The economic justification of Buk Bijela was determined by using
the discounted cash flow method to evaluate countrywide total system costs
with Buk Bijela and with the alternative means of meeting power requirements
most likely to be competitive. The program with Buk Bijela had the lowest
present value up to a discount rate of at least 13.7 percent. Since the
opportunity cost of capital in Yugoslavia is estimated to have a median
value of about 9-10 percent, Buk Bijela would represent the least cost means
to help meet forecast power consumption in the country.
60.       The rate of return is estimated to be 11.2 percent, measuring bene-
fits only by the incremental revenues from power sales attributable to the
project plus net secondary benefits. Sensitivity analysis shows the rate
would remain above 10 percent in all cases except an assumed 20 percent in-
crease in capital costs (when it would be 9.5 percent).
PART V - LEGAL INSTRUMENTS AND AUTHORITY
61.       The draft Loan Agreement between the Bank and Elektroprivreda,
Bosne i Hercegovine, the draft Project Agreement between the Bank and
Hidroelektrane na Drini, the draft Guarantee Agreement between the Socialist
Federal Republic of Yugoslavia and the Bank, the Report of the Committee
provided for in Article III, Section 4(iii) of the Articles of Agreement and
the text of a draft resolution approving the above loan, are being distribut-
ed to the Executive Directors separately.
62.       Provisions of the Loan Agreement of special interest were noted
in paragraphs 38, 39, 41, 42, 50, 51, 52 and 55.
63.       I am satisfied that the proposed loan would comply with the Articles
of Agreement of the Bank.

PART VI - RECOMMENDATIONS
64.       I recommend that the Executive Directors approve the proposed loan.

C.   PROJECTS IN EXECUTION 1/
Loan 531 Belgrade-Bar Railway: US$50.0 million Loan of March 22, 1968;
Closing Date: December 31, 1975.
The completion of this project was originally scheduled for 1973
but geo-technical and other construction difficulties in mountainous terrain
are expected to delay operation of the line at least until 1976. The Closing
Date will be adjusted when the final completion date is known.
As a result of inflation and cost overruns, the total project cost
has increased from $225.5 million to $350.0 million. Supplementary finance
authorized under existing legislation was exhausted at the end of 1974. iiow-
ever, a further US$59 million, approved in principle, is awaiting completion
of the legislative process and adequate interim finance is being provided by
local banks.
Loan 657 Telecommunications: US$40.0 million Loan of February 20, 1970;
Closing Date: June 30, 1975.
Delays in civil works have occurred which will delay completion of
the project until late 1975. With the exception of the earth satellite sta-
tion, only preliminary works have been completed. A cost overrun of US$5.1
million for orders already placed is expected due to currency revaluations.
Following a revision of the disbursement schedule, disbursements are now in
line with the revised projections.
Loan 678 Fourth Highway: US$40.0 million Loan of May 28, 1970;
Closing Date: December 31, 1975
After an initial delay of about one year in starting work on the
Sarajevo-Zenica section because of difficulties in acquiring the right-of-way,
and delays due to inclement weather in 1974, work on this section is proceeding
satisfactorily and all nine sections are expected to be substantially com-
pleted in the fall of 1975. The Closing Date has been postponed from June
30, 1974 to December 31, 1975.
1/   These notes are designed to inform the Executive Directors regarding
the progress of projects in execution, and in particular to report any
problems which are being encountered, and the action being taken to
remedy them. They should be read in this sense, and with understanding
that they do not purport to present a balanced evaluation of strengths
and weaknesses in project execution.

Loan 751 Fifth Highway: US$35.0 million Loan of June 18, 1971;
Closing Date: September 1, 1976.
After a delay of about eight months in fulfilling the conditions
for effectiveness of the loan, construction work on all sections is expected
to be completed by the end of 1975. A 10 percent increase in the appraisal
cost estimate is expected, and the disbursement percentage will be revised
when firm construction costs are established later this year. Disbursements
under the loan are about one year behind the appraisal estimate.
Loan 752 Bernardin Tourism: US$10.0 million Loan of June 18, 1971;
Closing Date; June 30, 1976.
There have been delays in implementation of the project due to
delays in making the loan effective, appointing consultants, providing the
necessary infrastructure and approvals by local authorities. As a result
disbursements are behind schedule. Bids received in July 1974 indicated that
the project, if it were to be implemented as originally envisaged (2,500 beds)
would cost approximately 100 percent above the originally estimated cost of
US$25.6 million. This increase was mainly due to rapid inflation in construc-
tion costs. The Bank and the project sponsors have agreed to finance a
reduced complex containing some 1,616 beds. The total cost would be US$35.8
million, requiring additional financing of about US$10 million. Financing
for the revised project has been arranged and construction has begun.
Loan 777 Ibar Multipurpose Water: US$45.0 million Loan of June 30, 1971;
Closing Date: December 31, 1976.
The start of project work was delayed for one year. However,
construction is now well underway with the main dam scheduled for completion
in 1976 and the irrigation networks in 1977. Project costs are currently
estimated to be about 17 percent above the appraisal estimate. Additional
funds are being provided by the Province of Kosovo. Disbursements are
proceeding in line with the revised schedule. Arrangements for land conso-
lidation and agricultural extension services have been delayed but proposals
are now being studied.
Loan 782 Babin Kuk Tourism: US$20.0 million Loan of July 21, 1971;
Closing Date: July 31, 1976.
There have been delays in the implementation of the project due to
delays in making the loan effective and in mobilizing consultants. According-
ly disbursements are behind schedule. Although these problems have now been
largely resolved, the project is almost two years behind schedule. Bids for
civil works and estimates for other components indicated that the project would
cost at least twice as much as originally estimated (US$49.9 million). This
increase is largely due to rapid inflation in construction costs. The Bank
and the project sponsors have agreed to finance a reduced complex containing

Page 5
some 2,034 beds. The total cost would be US$51.5 million requiring addi-
tional financing of about US$1.6 million. Financing for the revised project
has been arranged and construction has begun.
Loan 836 Power Transmission: US$75.0 million Loan of June 23, 1972;
Closing Date: June 30, 1977.
Project execution began about one year behind schedule mainly
because of coordination difficulties and inherent delays in reaching agree-
ment among 12 borrowers. (This is the first attempt at countrywide coordina-
tion in the sector). All major contracts have been awarded and construction
is proceeding satisfactorily. Action on appointment of Management consultants
to help improve planning, operation and management of the interconnected
power system is lagging and reporting, especially on financial matters, has
been deficient; accordingly, financial performance of some of the borrowers
is in doubt.  Also, in response to the principles of self-management, cer.ain
of the borrowers have reorganized and further reorganizations may be expected,
complicating the task of assessing financial performance. Cost overruns of
about 50 percent are expected to be met from loans from the Federal Republic
of Germany and the borrowers' own resources.
Loan 894 Agricultural Industries (Macedonia):   US$31 million Loan of May2,5
1973; Closing Date: December 31, 1978.
Forty-two of the expected 43 social sector subloans, and 35 private
sector subloans (81% of the amount allocated) have been approved by the lending
institution. Private sector demand for subloans already exceeds financing
available under the project. Four social sector sub-projects have been com-
pleted and twenty-nine are under construction. Progress is being made on the
three studies encompassed by the project.
Loan 916 Naftagas Pipeline: US$59.4 million Loan of June 25, 1973;
Closing Date: June 30, 1977.
This loan became effective on March 22, 1974, after about four
months' delay. Bids received on pipes and equipment exceeded appraisal es-
timates and civil works costs have increased so that project costs are now
about 93 percent above the appraisal estimate. Additional local finance for
civil works is being arranged but little additional foreign finance for pipes
and equipment is available. Discussions continue with the Borrower to trim
the project of its less essential items and to revise the implementation
schedule for the reduced project.
Loan 947 Kikinda Loan Foundry: US$14.5 million Loan of November 30, 1973;
Closing Date: March 31, 1978.
This loan was declared effective on May 28, 1974 after four months
delay, which was primarily due to the extra time required for the ratification
of the Guarantee Agreement by the Federal Assembly.   Project implementation
is proceeding on schedule.

subprojects (including three below the free limit) have been approved for dis-
bursements.
Loan 1026 Fourth Railway: US$93 million Loan of July 10, 1974;
Closing date: December 31, 1977.
This loan was declared effective on February 12, 1975 and disburse-
ments have begun.
