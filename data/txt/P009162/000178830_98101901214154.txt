APPRAISAL OF THE BUK BIJELA HYDROPOWER PROJECT
SUMARY AND CONCLUSIONS
i.        The report appraises the 450-M; Buk Bijela Hydroelectric Power
Project to be constructed on the Drina River in the Republic of Bosnia-
Herzegovina, for which the Yugoslav Government has requested Bank assistance
in financing. The Project represents 15% of the 1973-80 expansion program
(estimated to cost about US$1.6 billion) of Elektroprivreda, the Work Organiza-
tion responsible for coordination of the Basic Organizations of Associated
Labor engaged in power generation and transmission in the Republic of Bosnia-
Herzegovina - one of the less developed regions of Yugoslavia.,
ii.       The Project, which is the-largest of ten major power generation proj-
ects in the expansion program of Elektroprivreda, is estimated to cost US$242.5
million (including a contingency for future price increases, but excluding
interest during construction) of which about US$86 million would be for for-
eign costs. A Bank loan to Elektroprivreda of US$70 million (81% of the
foreign cost) is proposed. The remaining costs will be financed by borrowing
from the pooled resources of the basic organizations associated in Elektro-
privreda, from the Federal Fund and from surcharges on electricity sales and
loans from industry to be arranged by the republic. Confirmation that 35% of
the Project cost i.e. 1,358 million dinars will be made available out of the
pooled resources of Elektroprivreda's basic organizations and the adoption of
the decisions by the Republic to provide funds the loans and surcharges are
conditions of loan effectiveness.
iii.      One of the most important objectives of the Project will be to help
strengthen, within the national context, the coordination of planning and
operation of the power generation and transmission organizations in Bosnia-
Herzegovina. Management consultants are expected to be engaged for a study
to examine and make recommendations for improving the organization, training,
administrative and management procedures of Elektroprivreda.
iv.       During the construction period of the Project, 33% of Elektro-
privreda's very large expansion program would be financed from internal
sources, 34% from foreign borrowing including 4% from the proposed Bank loan
for Buk Bijela, and 33% from various local loans. In all, foreign currency
loans and suppliers' credits still required total 4.3 billion dinars (US$267
million equivalent). In the event of a shortage in financing, the Republic
of Bosnia-Herzegovina has undertaken to arrange for any additional funds
required to complete the construction program. A self-management agreement
containing provisions for the pooling of funds, acceptable to the Bank, has
been prepared by Elektroprivreda. As a condition of effectiveness
Elektroprivreda should confirm that the agreement has been signed by all
basic organizations.



- ii -
v.        During 1962-1973 electricity production in Yugoslavia rose from
13.5 TWh to 35.1 TWXh (about 10% per annum), and installed capacity from
3,081 MW to 8,408 MW. About 90% of all power is supplied by members of the
Union of Yugoslav Electric Power Industry (JUGFL), which coordinates the
major aspects of power generation and transmission in the country, but has no
executive authority over its members. Sales in the JUGEL system are expected
to increase from 29.4 TTh in 1973 to 66.9 TWh in 1980, when installed capacity
would be some 19,000 MW.
vi.       The shift from central economic planning to a socialist market
economy has lead to coordinating difficulties, and in the power sector has
caused, together with shortage of funds, deferment of decisions on new plants
until 1973/74, when crash construction programs were instituted throughout
the country aggregating some 3,000 MW in capacity. The present curtailment
in supply of electricity (mainly during the winter months) is expected to
persist until completion, by 1977/78, of large blocks of new plants.
vii.      During 1963-1973, electricity consumption in Electroprivreda's
system increased at an average rate of 13.2% per annum from 1,723 MWh to
5,963 G1Wh, and is expected to grow at the rate of 14.5% per annum, to 15,260
GWh by 1980, including supply of power to other republics (largely from plants
jointly financed with Croatia and Slovenia); the latter supDlies are expected
to increase from 2,191 GWh in 1973 to 4,005 CWh in 1980. Generating capacity
would more than triple from 1,092 MW to 3,560 M{. The Buk Bijela Project will
provide about 18% of this increase in capacity. Buk Bijela was found to be
included in a least-cost program for meeting the forecast Yugoslav power
consumption as compared with programs including alternative lignite-fired
plant or a mixture of lignite and nuclear plant (oil-fired plant would be
less economic due to the high price of oil, which has to be imported).
viii.     While Elektroprivreda will act mainly as an initiating and coordi-
nating agency, the supervision of Project construction will be by Hidroelektrane
Na Drini, Sarajevo, (Drina), an organization of associated labor being formed
by Elektroprivreda for the planning and development of hydropower projects on
the river Drina. The execution of an agreement between Elektropriveda and
Drina setting out their mutual rights and obligations (particularly with
respect to the Project), acceptable to the Bank, is a condition of loan
effectiveness. A contract has already been awarded to a Yugoslav contractor
for the first phase of the civil works and all tender specifications are
expected to be completed in early 1975. Consulting engineers for the Project,
Energoinvest of Sarajevo, will be assisted whenever appropriate by foreign
consultants (financed from the Bank loan) for importantgeological and hydro
problems that may arise.
-ix.      Procurement of .equipment and materials to be financed from the pro-
posed loan would be on the basis of international competetive bidding (except
for consultant services), in accordance with the Bank's Guidelines for Pro-
curement. Yugoslav manufacturers, who would be granted a preference of 15%
or customs duties whichever is lower, are expected to bid successfully for
many of the main contracts. Disbursements would be made for the c.i.f. cost



- iii -
of imported materials and equipment, or ex-factory cost of locally supplied
materials and equipment, and the cost of engineering services, management
consultants and training.
x.        Elektroprivreda's 1973 financial statements show a rate of return
of about 5% on average net fixed assets in service. From 1974 until the end
of the decade, the rate of return is expected to average 9% with a low of
about 6.5% in 1980 when large blocks of plant become operational. The ex-
pected contribution to investment from internal cash generation during the
period to 1980 would be about 34%. Agreement has been reached for the adop-
tion of a financial covenant similar to that in Loan 836-YU requiring that
prices for the sale of electricity be set at a level to produce a surplus of
internal funds sufficient to cover at least 35% of the cost of expansion of
Elektroprivreda's facilities during any plan period of the Guarantor.
xi.       The economic rate of return on the Project is estimated to be at
least 11.2%.
xii.      Agreement having been reached on the principal issues, subject to
the conditions of effectiveness, the Project is suitable for a Bank loan of
US$70 million to Elektroprivreda Bosne i Herzegovina, Sarajevo with the
guarantee of the Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia (to be re-lent a
major portion of which would be made available) to Hidroelektrane Na Drini
Sarajevo. Based on the assumed useful life for a hydroelectric plant and the
estimated construction time, an appropriate term for the loan is 25 years with
5 years of grace.

APPRAISAL OF THE BUK BIJELA HYDROPOWER PROJECT
1. INTRODUCTION
1.01      The Federal Government of Yugoslavia, on behalf of the Republic of
Bosnia-Herzegovina and Elektroprivreda BiH, the organization responsible for
the generation and transmission of power in Bosnia-Herzegovina, has requested
the Bank to help finance a Project estimated to cost US$242.5 million equi-
valent. For this Project, which forms about 15% of Elektroprivreda's 1973-
1980 construction program, a loan of US$70 million is proposed' to finance
part (81%) of the foreign exchange cost. The Project comprises the 450-MW
Buk Bijela hydroelectric power station on the river Drina in the Republic. of
Bosnia-Herzegovina, engineering studies and improvement in administration,
accounting and training.
1.02      The Project, which has been under investigation for about 20 years,
would be the sixth step in the development of the hydro potential of the Drina
river catchment area. EnergoinveLt of Sarajevo, the consultants and engineers
for the Project, were responsible for the final studies, for which Energo-
projekt of Belgrade prepared a report showing the economic justification.
1.03      Three power loans have been made previously to Yugoslavia:  Loan
277-YU (US$30 m; 1961) for the 266-MW Senj hydro plant on the Lika/Gacka
rivers in Croatia, Loan 318-YU (US$30 m; 1962) for the 360-MW Bajina Basta
hydro station on the Drina in Serbia, both completed in 1969 and operating
satisfactorily, and Loan 836-YU (US$75 m. 1972) for the 380-kV transmission
system comprising about 3,000 km of lines and substation facilities, inter-
connecting the whole of the country, scheduled for completion by 1976/77.
Construction on the latter project is about a year behind schedule due prin-
cipally to difficulty in achieving coordination among the 12 borrowers (para
2.08). All major contracts have now been awarded and further delays are not
expected, but despite prompting by the Bank, action on appointment of manage-
ment consultants is lagging and reporting, especially on financial matters,
has been deficient; accordingly, it has not been possible to verify the fi-
nancial performance of some of the borrowers. Also, in response to the
principles of self-management (para 2.02), certain of the borrowers have re-
organized and further reorganizations may be expected complicating the task
of assessing financial performance. Cost overruns of about 50% are expected
to be met from loans from the Federal Republic of Germany and the borrowers'
own resources.
1.04      This appraisal report was prepared by W.F. Kupper (engineer), T.B.
Russell (economist), and P.A. Cordukes (financial analyst). It is based on
information obtained by Bank missions which visited Yugoslavia comprising
Messrs. Kupper and Russell in May/June 1974, Messrs. Mathai and Cordukes
in July 1974 and Messrs. Kupper, Russell, Cordukes and Maffei (Legal) in
September/October 1974 and information provided by the Union of Yugoslav
Electric Power Industry (JUGEL), Elektroprivreda and its consultants.



2.  THE ENERGY AND POWER SECTOR
The Country and the Economy
2.01      Yugoslavia is a federation of six republics and two autonomous
provinces. It has an area of 255,804 km2 and the estimated population (1974)
is 21.1 million growing at 0.9%/a. It has a socialist market economy in which
most of the means of production are owned by society as a whole but are en-
trusted, through a system of self-management, to the control of the workers
that use them. There is a private sector, accounting for only 15% of GDP which
is made up of small farms and businesses.
2.02      In the social sector decisions are decentralized and largely out-
side the scope of government on any level, although there are policies for
mandatory coordination in certain instances. The basic principle for all
economic decision-making is self-management by the workers. The basic
decision-making units are called Basic Organizations of Associated labor
(BOAL), which are technically identifiable units which could, at least in
principle, function independently. In most instances, several BOALs are
integrated into Work Organizations of Associated Labor through revocable con-
tracts known as self-management agreements. 1/ The affairs of BOAL's and
work organizations are governed by councils elected by all the workers.
2.03      When the economic activities of workers are of concern to others,
such as in public utilities, transport and public services (health, educa-
tion, etc.), Self-Managing Communities of Interest are established by the
organizations of associated labor in these fields and the beneficiaries of
their products or services. The communities of interest provide the frame-
work for developing, financing and regulating the activity concerned. They
are a recent development and many of them are still in the process of being
established.
2.04      The economy has grown at the high rate of 5.5%/a over the last two
decades, and GDP per capita at 4.5%/a. At the extremes wide disparities
exist between regions; compared with the national average of about US$900
(1973), per capita GDP is one-third in Kosovo and nearly double in Slovenia;
the figure for Bosnia-Herzegovina, the location of the proposed project is
about US$600. Industry, which now accounts for 40% of GDP (27% twenty years
ago), has grown at about 9%/a. Agriculture now accounts for 20% of GDP
compared with 38% twenty years ago; its growth rate has been about 2.5%/a.
The projected future trend of economic growth implies continuation of the
past high growth rate in electricity demand (see 2.16).
Energy Resources
2.05      Yugoslavia's main indigenous energy resources are lignite, coal,
and hydro power. Total fossil fuel reserves are estimated at 5.9 x 109 tons
1/   See Annex 1 for definition of the forms of organizations.



-3-
of standard coal equivalent (tce) 1/, with coal and lignite acounting for 97%
and other sources 3%. Reserves of coal and lignite (85%) are about 5.7 x
109 tce, located mainly (70%) in Kosovo and in Bosnia-Herzegovina (20%).
Annual production is about 33 x 106 t. Hydro resources represent about 60
TWh/a; existing average hydro energy capability is about 17-18 TWh/a. About
70% of the hydro potential is located in Croatia, Serbia and Bosnia-
Herzegovina, the last accounting for 27%.
2.06      National energy policy is based on restraining dependence on im-
ported fuel, particularly oil, through greater utilization of indigenous
energy sources. Since the short-run possibilities for substituting coal,
lignite and electricity for oil are limited, medium and long-term adjust-
ments are needed. Investments in the energy sector will have to rise rapidly
from the 1973 level of about $260 million to an average of around $825 million
per year during 1975-79. Most investments (about 70%) are needed in the
power sector. Financing these investments will be difficult but not imposs-
ible. In relative terms energy sector investments will have to be an estimat-
ed 10.2% of total investment and 3.6% of GDP, which was about their level
during the late 1960s.
Organization of the Power Sector
2.07      Electric power enterprises in Yugoslavia are organized on the prin-
ciples of workers' self-management. A single power plant is typically operat-
ed by a Basic Organization of Associated Labor. BOALs within a larger geo-
graphic area may form a Work Organization, which could comprise BOALs concern-
ed with transmission, research and development or support services as well as
power generating plants. Distribution units are generally organized separate-
ly but on similar lines.
2.08      All bulk supplv and transmission entities are required to be members
of the Union of Yugoslav Electric Power Industry (JUGEL). JUGEL coordinates
the major aspects of power generation and transmission in the country, but has
no executive authority over its memLers. Distribution organizations, grouped
in their own association, buy electricity in bulk from JUGEL's generation and
transmission members. Some of the larger distribution organizations have
joined JUGEL and others are expected to do so.
2.09      The decentralized nature of the sector led inter alia to a lack
of technical cooperation and difficulties in coordinating investment alloca-
tions; in the past decisions have been made on a local bAsis without due re-
gard to overall country planning and power development. This, together with
lack of funds, has already caused severe power shortages during the extremely
dry year 1973, when an estimated 5.6% of total electricity requirements could
not be met, mostly in the last quarter. The situation persisted in the early
months of 1974, occurring again at the end of the year, and early 1975, even
though hydrological conditions were good. Although in 1973/74 crash construc-
tion programs were instituted for the construction of new thermal plants
1/   1 tce = 7 x 106 kilo-calories.



-4-
aggregating some 3,000 MW, the situation is not expected to improve until
1977/78 when most of these plants will be commissioned.
2.10      The Bank is encouraging integration in the sector through lending
for the construction of a 380-kV transmission system that will provide a
country-wide electricity grid (Loan 836-YU). In connection with the trans-
mission project, JUGEL prepared a study on 'The Development of Electric Power
Production in Yugoslavia, 1972 to 1980". The study identified needed invest-
ments but did not provide priority ranking or identify financial resources;
these matters are the responsibility of JUGEL's members rather than of JUGEL
itself.
Tariffs
2.11      The present tariff structure for bulk supply from the JUGEL inter-
connected system, applicable throughout the country, was introduced by the
Federal Government on August 1, 1965. The structure reflects the philosophy
that tariffs charged should correctly reflect the costs of supply which,
given the mixed hydro/thermal character of the system, can vary widely accord-
ing to the month of the year, day of the week and time of day. In 1973, the
power to set electricity tariffs and rates was transferred to the republics.
Now, in effect, a JUGEL committee on tariffs and rates, comprising members of
each republic's power organizations, makes recommendations to a Federal Gov-
ernment Committee on prices. By agreement between the republics maximum rate
levels are set and published in the Federal Gazette.
2.12      Since 1965 the average realized bulk price of electricity through-
out the country rose from 8.42 para/kWh (USO0.53/kWh) to 18.88 para/kWh
(US01.18/kWh) in 1973, i.e. by 124%, compared with 167% for the cost of
living index.
2.13      Because the tariff structure has remained unchanged since 1965,
the Bank discussed with Federal officials during negotiations the desirability
of a study to be undertaken by JUGEL, assisted by consultants, to review the
tariff structure and rates to ensure that they correctly reflect, as far as
possible, the marginal cost of supply from the interconnected system. In the
event the Yugoslav power enterprises seek Bank assistance for financing the
second phase of the 380-kV transmission expansion, it was pointed out that
such a study should have reached an advanced stage.
Historical Development
2.14      National power sector statistical data for the period 1963-73 are
shown in Annex 2. Total production increased from 13.5 TWh in 1963 to 35.1
TWh in 1973 (trend 10.1% annually). The members of JUGEL accounted for 12.3
TWh (91%) in 1963 and 32.6 TWh (93%) in 1973, showing a trend growth rate
of 10.8%/a. Installed capacity rose from 3,081 NW (JUGEL: 2,656 MW or 86%)
in 1963 to 8,408 MW(JUGEL:  7,892 MW or 94%) in 1973.  Details of the installed
generating capacity of members of JUGEL as at September 14, 1974, are shown
in Annex 3.



- 5 -
2.15      Hydro generation averaged about 58% of total generation during
1963-1973, but the share of hydro has steadily diminished, reflecting an
increase in steam-electric plant for which financing could be obtained more
easily and which generally has a shorter construction period.
Load Forecast
2.16      Forecasts of electricity requirements in the JUGEL system are made
by its members and consolidated by JUGEL into a single national forecast.
The resulting figures for the period 1974-85 are shown in Annex 4. Sales are
projected to increase from 29.4 TWh in 1973 to 66.9 TWh in 1980, and 100 TWh
in 1985, the annual growth rate declining to 9.2% in 1980 and 8.4% thereafter.
The forecast implies that per capita consumption would rise from about 1,600
kWh in 1973 to some 4,600 kWh in 1985, i.e. to about the level attained by
Britain in 1971. No recent information is available on the percentage of the
population having access to electricity, but the country is largely electri-
fied.
2.17      The projection looks reasonable in relation to Yugoslavia's present
stage,of development and, on the supply side, in view of the present lack of
capacity.   However, major new industrial loads represent a significant pro-
portion of the forecast annual additional sales as shown in Annex 5 and it is
always possible that some of these loads may be late or fail to materialize.
Therefore, for the sensitivity analysis of the Project justification (see
5.07) annual growth rates ±15% of those in the JUGEL forecast were used,
which are judged to cover the likely range of possibilities.
Future Development
2.18      The Buk Bijela hydro station would form part of the interconnected
power system of Yugoslavia; details of the country's 1974-1980 expansion
program in generation (as presented by JUGEL, expressed in 1973 prices),
estimated to cost 69 billion dinars (US$4.3 billion), are shown in Annex 6.
This program would add a capacity of about 11 GW by 1980 to the present
installed capacity of 8 GW. In view of financing difficulties, some slip-
page appears likely. During the same period about 4,600 km of 380-kV lines
(including about 3,000 km financed under Loan 836-YU), some 2,000 km of 220-
kV lines, and about 7,000 km of 110-kV lines would be added, together with
sojne 36 GVA in substation capacity at these voltage levels.
2.19      The Bank has been urging JUGEL for some time to carry out,
through consultants, a comprehensive study for the least-cost development
of the whole power sector, which is essential for proper planning and
decision-making. A study was submitted to the Bank in November 1972, (see
2.10) and was revised in September 1973. JUGEL's consultants are now pre-
paring a new study including an overall financing plan which will clearly
define the future development program and will reflect major changes since
1973 affecting the sector. This is a major undertaking. In the event that
JUGEL seeks a Bank loan for the second phase of the 380-kV transmission ex-
pansion, this study will need to have reached an advanced stage prior to
appraisal.



3. THE BORROWER
Organization and Legal Aspects
3.01      The Borrower for the proposed project would be Elektroprivreda
Bosne I Hercegovine (BiH) Sarajevo. Elektroprivreda is a Work Organization
composed of 17 BOALs (6 hydro-plants, 2 thermal-plants, a transmission enter-
prise, a switchyard, 5 capital investment and/or support service units, a fish
farm and a worker's cafeteria) from the power sector of the Republic of Bosnia-
Herzegovina (see Annex 7). It was established when the 17 BOALs signed a
Self-Management Agreement on December 21, 1973 (Annex 8) by which it is gov-
erned. Statutes enacted in July 1974 provide for its organization, self-
management, conduct of business, use of resources and distribution of income.
3.02      Elektroprivreda was established for the following principal pur-
poses:
(i) preparation of major power development programs for Bosnia-
Herzegovina;
(ii)  pooling of all free funds to be used for capital expenditure
in the power sector;
(iii) determination of the annual and long-term power balance;
(iv)  collection and distribution of revenues to its members; and
(v) determination of electricity tariffs for the purchase and
sale of power.
3.03      Elektroprivreda operates under an Electricity Law enacted by the
Republic of Bosnia-Herzegovina on April 26, 1974 (it is summarized in Annex
9).  The law regulates power industry organization, generation, transmission
and distribution in Bosnia-Herzegovina within the framework of the Yugoslav
constitution. It provides for the establishment of a self-managing community
of interest (see 2.03) to be created by agreement between the power producers
and consumers in Bosnia-Herzegovina.
3.04      The self-managing community of interest has not yet been formed.
When it is, it will be responsible for, among other things:
(i) coordination of plans for generation and transmission through-
out Bosnia-Herzegovina, and with JUGEL;
(ii) financing of power programs;
(iii)  determination of bulk supply tariffs; and
(iv) conditions of supply.



- 7 -
There will be separate but similar "Basic Self-Managing Communities of In-
terest" for the local power distribution systems in Bosnia-Herzegovina, which
will themselves have representatives in the above self-managing community of
interests for generation and transmission.
3.05      Under Elektroprivreda's self-management agreement, the seventeen
basic organizations signatory to the agreement have adopted a 1973-80 power
development program. They have agreed to use all available free funds in
their business (equity) and depreciation funds to help finance this program.
Further, they have agreed to make available their free foreign exchange to
meet debt service payments on foreign loans. Contracts for foreign borrowing
must be signed by Elektroprivreda and the agreements approved by its Worker's
Council. Other provisions require Elektroprivreda and its basic organizations
to sign self-management agreements setting out the methods to be followed by
Elektroprivreda when distributing the income from electricity sales and for
determining the internal prices which would be paid to each basic organization
for generation or transmission of power. The last mentioned agreements be-
came law on October 16, 1974. The basic organization., Dubrovnik, which com-
prises a 216-MW hydro plant, located below the Trebinje hydro plant in Croatia,
did not sign the Self-Management Agreement with the other 17 BOALs (para 3.01)
although up to the end of 1974 it was considered part of the Bosnia-Herzegovina
power system (the statistical data, see 3.16, reflects this latter arrangement).
3.06      Although Elektroprivreda will be the Borrower, the project will be
executed by Hidroelektrane Na Drini, Sarajevo (Drina). Drina is not yet a
BOAL because it has no assets or income; it is an enterprise "under founda- "
tion". 1/ It was originally founded by Elektroprenos Sarajevo, one of the
BOAL's responsible for power transmission in Bosnia--Herzegovina, to supervise
the planning and construction of Buk Bijela and other hydro-plants on, the
Drina. On July 25, 1974, Elektroprivreda took steps to assume the founders
responsibility for Drina; it has informed the Bank that the transfer of Drina
from Elektroprenos has been completed and has been registered with the
District Court, Sarajevo.
3.07      Drina is now managed by a council of seven - four elected from its
workers and three from Elektroprivreda. The decisions of the council are
carried out by a General Manager or his Deputy.  It appears likely that work-
ers, operating a completed plant, would create a new basic organization incor-
porating this plant, the "construction" part of Drina continuing to be "in
foundation" for a still undefined time, constructing other plants on the
Drina.
3.08      Elektroprivreda has nominated a six-member commission (three from
Elektroprivreda and three from Drina) to draft all agreement between Drina and
Elektroprivreda setting out the rights and obligations between the two parties,
particularly with regard to borrowing from the pooled resources of Elektro-
privreda, use of possible IBRD loan proceeds and the manner in which debt
This is a term used to describe an enterprise in the construction stage
prior to commencement of operations.



service and other obligations to Elektroprivreda under the Bank's loan agree-
ment might be met.  The execution of the agreement in a fonm acceptable to
the Bank is a condition of loan effectiveness.
3.09      It is recommended that a Loan Agreement be signed with Elektro-
privreda and a Project Agreement be executed with Drina which would reflect
the basic undertakings agreed upon between Elektroprivreda and Drina with
respect to execution of projects in general, and would reflect in particular
the obligations for executing the Project transferred to Drina.
3.10      Assurances were obtained in the Project Agreement that should Drina,
upon completion of Buk Bijela, transfer the assets to a new basic organization
to be established at such time, it will exchange views with the Bank and such
transfer would occur under arrangements acceptable to the Bank.
Management
3.11      Elektroprivreda is controlled bv the Workers' Council which has 3
members and 3 alternates from each basic organization, assisted bv an Execu-
tive Board with 1 member from each basic organization. The board analyzes
and monitors operations, construction, application of the electricity law,
the self-management agreement, and decisions of the Council, to which it
makes recommendations requiring Council's approval. The Chief Executive is
the General Manager. He is the legal representative of the enterprise and
is appointed by the Council for a period of 4 years, which may be renewed.
The day to day operations are directed by a Deputy General Manager, an exe-
cutive with many years' experience in power utilities.
Organization and Staffing
3.12      Elektroprivreda's head office has 4 divisions:  Organization and
Legal; Dispatching, Purchase and Sale of Power; Economy and Finance; and
Research and Development. Regular staff at present number 76 at the head
office (including 9 graduate engineers) and 2,986 in the basic organizations.
Elektroprivreda's organizational chart is shown in Annex 7.
3.13      It is intended that Elektroprivreda would employ consultants, fi-
nanced from the proposed loan, for a management study of the main aspects of
Elektroprivreda's organization and administration (see 6.08 and Annex 24).
The study would also cover training and planning, for which Elektroprivreda,
in view of its recent creation, has not yet set up specific and comprehensive
programs. Either the management consultants or, in the event that the con-
sultants lack the required overall training expertise, a training expert to
be engaged by the consultants after consultation with the Bank, should invest-
igate the training needs of Elektroprivreda and its basic organizations. The
Bank's Training Advisor will assist in drafting the proposed terms of refer-
ence for the management study, and will review the training study and any
recommendations.



-9-
Tariffs
3.14      Elektroprivreda's tariff structure is that agreed upon throughout
the country (see 2.11); rates have been set at the maximum levels allowed
(see Annex 10), except that certain special industrial consumers are charged
below the scheduled rates in return for agreeing that they mav be disconnected
at certain periods at Elektroprivreda's option. Discussions are now under
way regarding the terms of supply to a new power intensive industry, aluminum
smelting.
3.15      In order to ensure that proper account is taken of the long-run
marginal costs of supply, Elektroprivreda has agreed in making power supply
agreements outside the regular tariff schedule that it will charge prices
adequately reflecting the estimated costs of supply for the contractual period
and ensure that such agreements include provisions for future price adjustments
in the light of increases in the costs of supply.
Historical Development
3.16      Historical data for 1963-73 for Elektroprivreda's supply area (i.e.
Bosnia-Herzegovina) are shown in Annex 11. During this period, electricity
consumption including the output of plant owned by distribution companies,
industry and that financed with Croatia (under special contracts that reserve
fixed amounts of power for Croatia), increased from 2,024 GWh to 6,307 GWh,
or an average of 12%/a.  The market share of the basic organizations (now
associated in Elektroprivreda and including the Dubrovnik hydro plant, see
3.05) grew from 85% in 1963 to 95% in 1973. Industrial consumption, which
was 64% of the total in 1963, decreased to 41% in 1973 (although in absolute
figures it increased an average of 7.2% annually); during the same period sup-
plies to Croatia increased from 294 GWh (15%) to 2,191 GWh (35%). Installed
capacity, 494 MW in 1963, almost tripled to 1,432 MT by 1973 (including 72 MW
financed jointly with Croatia).
3.17      Elektroprivreda's sales per consumer category are summarized as
follows:
1963     %      1973     %
Electroprivreda Sales (GWh)
Distribution Enterprises              749      44   2,576      43
Industry                              680      39   1,196      20
Interrepublican supplies (net)        294      17   2,191      37
1,723    100   5,963    100
Total Electroprivreda sales (including supply from 72 MT of hydro plant
jointly financed with Croatia under special contracts) increased at an
average of 13.2% annually. Net supplies to other republics, at an annual
growth rate of 22%, increased their share of Elektroprivreda sales from 17%
in 1963 to 37% in 1973. Hydro generation, which averaged about 55% of total



- 10 -
generation during the period, has declined steadily from some 60% early in
the period to about 50% at present (39% in 1973, an extremely dry year).
Installed capacity increased from 371 MN in 1963 (of which 222 MI hydro, or
60%) to 1,308 MW in 1973 (706  W hydro or 54%), i.e. 13.4% annually.  Maximum
demand, which was 543 MW in 1965 (no information is available on prior years)
attained 1,110 MW in 1973, when demand was suppressed due to the extremely
poor water year.  Assuming 5% suppression, annual growth of maximum demand
has been of the order of about 10% in the last 8 years, when the load factor
increased from 57% to about 64%.
3.18      Because Elektroprivreda has been created only recently, operational
statistical data have not yet been consolidated and are scant. Preliminary
information on plant characteristics and operational costs (1970-73, and
estimates in some details for 1974) are presented in Annex 12). Since prepa-
ration of meaningful operational statistical data would be highly desirable,
Elektroprivreda will include annually in its Progress Report for the Project
a set of statistical data and monitoring indicators including, to the extent
possible those for the past five years, as generally outlined in Annex 13.
In view of the lack of historical data, no meaningful monitoring targets can
be set. However, during supervision the subject should be reviewed regularly
in order to discuss and define such targets in cooperation with Elektropriv-
reda.
Load Forecast and Development Program
3.19      Elektroprivreda's forecasts for the period 1974-1980 (Annex 14) in-
dicate that sales would grow at an average of 14.5% annually over 1973. This
relatively large increase, however, is due mainly to the expected rapid devel-
opment of large industrial sales during the period, averaging about 25% an-
nually. Sales to distribution enterprises would grow some 10-11% annually,
which is in accordance with past trends. Supplies to other republics would
increase from 2,191 Ghrh in 1973 to 4,005 GWh in 1980, or an average of 9%/a.
This is due to the relatively large investments in jointly owned plants to be
made by Croatia and Slovenia in the earlier years; of the 2,468 MW additional
capacity, 599 MW (24% of the total; 99 MW hydro capacity and 500 MW thermal
capacity) would be financed jointly. Energy generated by this plant would not
be available to Bosnia-Herzegovina but would be sold to these republics under
special contracts. Installed capacity is expected to grow from 1,092 MW (45%
hydro excluding 216 MW of Dubrovnik, see 3.05) in 1973 to 3,560 MW (52% hydro)
by 1980, and maximum demand from 1,110 W to 2,981 MW, or about 15%/a. Al-
though the installed capacity would more than triple, the,plant margin would
remain low until the end of the decade, reflecting the delays in decisions on
construction of new plants.
3.20      The 1973-1980 development program would add about 1,360 MW of hydro
plant and 1,110 MW of thermal plant to the system. About 550 km of 380-kV
transmission lines would be completed in addition to the lines financed by the
Bank (Loan 836-YU), and some 2,500 km of 220-kV and 110-kV lines.



- 11 -
3.21      Total cost of the development program (Annex 15), at 1974 prices,
would be the following:
Din 106         US$106
Thermal Plant                    5,214            326
Hydro Plant                      7,471            467
Transmission                     5,238            327
Other                               70              5
17,993          1,125
of which:  Project (base cost) 2,707              169 (15% of
total)
Expected price increases, both local and foreign, would increase these costs
by about 40%.
3.22      Although the development program appears large, it is considered
reasonable because a stepped-up program is required to meet forecast demand
after several years of stagnating power development, and because the program
includes 599 MW (24% of total) of generating plant for reserved supplies to
Croatia and Slovenia, which would share part of the cost.
4. THE PROJECT
Project Description
4.01      The Project (see Annex 16) consists of:
(a)  the construction of the Buk Bijela hydro-electric station
on the Drina river, located slightly downstream from the
confluence of the Piva and Tara rivers, comprising a rock
fill dam with clay core, spiliways, intakes and pressure
tunnels, cavern type power house containing four 112.5-MW
turbo-generator units operating under a net head of 84 m,
and appropriate accessory equipment and a switchyard; a
compensating reservoir with concrete dam about 10 km
downstream near the town of Foca would regulate discharge
waters;
(b)  consulting services for special engineering studies for Buk
Bijela and improvement of Elektroprivreda's (and related
bodies) organization including administration, accounting,
and training.

Cost Estimates
4.02      The estimated cost of the Project (Annex 17), excluding interest
during construction, is US$242.5 million, of which US$85.9 would be in for-
eign exchange. Cost estimates are summarized as follows:
Dinar Millions               US$ Millions
Local     Foreign    Total  Local    Foreign   Total

Drice                 862.5       310.2   1,172.7  53.90       19.39   73.29
Total Project Cost  2,504.9    1,374.6   3,879.5 156.55         85.92  242.47
4.03      The cost estimates are based on the estimates of Elektroprivreda's
consultants, Energoinvest of Sarajevo, reflecting September 1974 price levels.
Physical contingencies, depending on the type of work, result in an overall
allowance of about 12.5% for local and 9% for foreign cost. To allow for
future price rises the official Bosnia-Herzegovina escalation scale (which was
being used by the republic's government to assess construction costs, and is
acceptable to the Bank) has been used as follows:
1975  1976  1977  1978  1979  1980
Local Cost (%)         20    16    13    10       8     7
Foreign Cost (%)       15    11      9     7      7     7
On the basis of these estimates the cost of the hydro station would be about
US$540/kW, which appears realistic.
Project Financing Plan
4.04      The Project cost is expected to be financed as follows:

A Bank loan of US$70 million financing 29% of the Project cost has been as-
sumed for a term of 25 years including a 5-year grace period subject to inter-
est at 8-1/2%/a. Interest during construction on the Bank loan of about
US$15 million will be met by the BOALs from the free foreign exchange funds
(see 3.05) or by obtaining foreign exchange from the National Bank (see 6.18).
Drina has obtained a loan for 110 million dinars from the Bosnia-Herzegovina
share of the Federal Fund 1/ for the first stage of civil works. This loan
is repayable over 20 years subject to interest at 7% and is expected to pro-
vide 3% of the cost of the Project.
4.05      Elektroprivreda is expected to make available out of the free funds
of its basic organizations 35% of the total Project cost (see 6.13), As a
condition of effectiveness, Elektroprivreda is expected to confirm that an
amount of not less than Din 1,358 million will be made available from this
source for the construction of .he Project. It will be subject to interest
at 6% and repayable over 25 years commencing after the end of the contractual
guarantee period. The remaining costs (i.e. 33% of total requirements) will
be secured through loans from industry and surcharges on the sale of power to
be arranged by the Republic of Bosnia-Herzegovina. The loans from industry
will be repayable over 15 years with interest at 4%. The surcharge will be
treated as equity or capital contributions from consumers. The adoption of
decisions by the Republic to provide these funds is also a condition of effec-
tiveness.
Engineering, Construction and Supervision
4.06      Consulting engineers for the Project would be Energoinvest of
Sarajevo, experienced consultants in the design and construction of hydro
plants, who have executed most of the extensive preliminary surveys, studies,
borings, tests, and designs for the Project, which are practically complete.
Whenever deemed appropriate by Elektroprivreda, foreign consultants would be
engaged, under conditions acceptable to the Bank, for special engineering
1/   Officially:  The Federal Fund for Crediting Accelerated Development in
the Economically Insufficiently Developed Republics and the Socialist
Autonomous Province of Kosovo.



- 14 -
services (including review of Energoinvest's st:udies of substantive import-
ance) for particular and important geological and hydro problems (e.g. flood
water waves) that may arise during construction. Elektroprivreda will con-
tinue to employ consultants whose qualifications, experience and terms and
conditions of employment shall be satisfactory to the Bank (and Elektropriv-
reda), for preparation of bid documents, evaluation of the bids, and super-
vision of construction of the Project. Construction is expected to be complet-
ed by the end of 1979 or early 1980.
4.07      Drina, the organization responsible for construction and supervi-
sion of the Buk Bijela hydro plant, is expected to largely complete its re-
cruitment of staff - scheduled to number 71 (of whom 21 would be university
graduates including engineers)-by the end of 1975. At the time of appraisal
the number of staff was 25. During the initial period Elektroprivreda will
provide the necessary guidance, together with the engineering consultants,
Energoinvest. The management consultants (see 6.08 and Annex 24) would,
inter alia, provide assistance for setting up Project administration. Also
Drina will, under arrangements satisfactory to the Bank, cause the hydroworks,
including the dams, to be inspected regularly in accordance with sound engineer-
ing practices.
Disbursement and Procurement
4.08      The proceeds of the proposed loan would finance part of the foreign
cost of construction equipment and materials required for the civil works, and
the cost of hydro-mechanical and electrical materials and equipment. Dis-
bursements would be for the c.i.f. cost of imported items or ex-factory cost
of such items supplied under contracts won by Yugoslav manufacturers, and for
the cost of related construction and engineering services, management con-
sultants and training. Savings would be allocal:ed to foreign consultant
services for development studies, or civil works. The closing date would
be December 31, 1981, to allow for unexpected delays and final payments after
expiration of the contractual technical guarantee periods. The expected dis-
bursements from the proposed loan and proposed allocation of loan proceeds
are shown in Annex 18. Contracts for equipment would be awarded on the basis
of international competitive bidding consistent with Bank Group Guidelines
for Procurement. A preference of 15% or applicable duties, whichever is the
lesser, would be granted to Yugoslav manufacturers who participate. Histori-
cally, Yugoslav manufacturers have been successful in similar bidding for
hydro plant contracts and it is expected that they will be successful in
being awarded many of the main contracts. Contracts for preliminary civil
works, which are being financed from local sources, have been awarded to
Hidrogradnsa of Sarajevo. Several contractors will be invited to submit
proposals for executing the main civil works, the bulk of which also will be
financed from local funds. Construction equipment and materials for civil
works to be financed from the loan would be purchased by Drina, using pro-
cedures in accordance with the Bank's guidelines, and then made available to
the successful civil works contractor. Bid docunents for Bank-financed con-
tracts are expected to be completed in early 1975. As agreed between
Electroprivreda and JUGEL at the time of appraisal, these documents would be



- 15 -
monitored by JUGEL. As the representative of the borrowers for Loan 836-YU,
this organization has obtained previous experience in the preparation of
bidding documents reflecting the Bank Guidelines.
Environment
4.09      The Buk Bijela reservoir and Foca compensating reservoir would flood
a comparatively small area of 1,360 ha of land, comprising 562 ha of forest,
416 ha cultivated land and 382 ha of unfertile land. A 12.5-km section of
road and a 2.5-km section of a forest railroad will be relocated above the re-
servoir level. In addition to a 4-MW private power plant, 3 schools, 3 shops
and 3 warehouses, a church and a cemetery will be relocated in the area of
Foca. About 136 houses with 610 inhabitants will be relocated, or compensated
if the owners so wish. At the time of appraisal fair agreements on indemnifi-
cations (i.e. to provide a former owqner with about the same economic situation
he had prior to flooding of his properties) had been reached with the majority
of the present owners. Provisions appear to be adequate, financially as well
as otherwise; displaced persons will have employment priority in the area (in-
cluding the Project); children will have scholarship priority and assistance
will be provided by the Foca community for buying in the area parcels of land
suitable for agricultural development, construction of new houses and reloca-
tion of some public buildings.
4.10      The ecological effects of the Project are expected to be small.
However, neither for similar projects already executed in the basin, nor for
future projects - including Buk Bijela - has there been any study of problems
for the basin's fishery resources resulting from the series of dams proposed
for the various rivers. Elektroprivreda will undertake a study of the fishery
resources of the portion of the Drina river within Bosnia-Herzegovina, assist-
ed by consultants acceptable to the Bank in accordance with terms of reference
acceptable to the Bank, as outlined in Annex 19, and discuss with the Bank
the results of the study. This study would be carried out within the context
of a separate study covering the entire Drina river basin. Consultants for
this purpose will be engaged prior to Dccember 31, 1975, for completion of the
study within one year.
5. PROJECT JUSTIFICATION
Market Growth
5.01      The Buk Bijela hydro power station would form part of the inter-
connected power system of Yugoslavia. The trend growth rate of sales in the
system since 1963 has been 10.8%/a, which is projected to decline to 9.2% in
1980, and 8.4%/a during 1980-85. Beyond 1985 the consultants assumed a con-
tinued downward trend to 7.8%/a for 1986-90 and 5.1%/a for 1991-2000.  Re-
quirements would be 240 TWh by the year 2000, compared with 105 TWh in 1985.
was assumed, in view of the uncertainties of such forecasts, that the
growth rates could be 15% higher and 15% lower than those given (see Annex 20).



- 16 -
Alternative Development Strategies
5.02      JUGEL's long term development strategy for Yugoslavia follows the
country's objectives for progressive exploitation of the country's hydropower
and lignite resources, supplemented by the introduction of nuclear power on
a growing scale from 1980 onward.  Hydropower (about 45 TWh/a and some 10 GW
in capacity) was assumed to be fully developed in the year 2000, when fossil-
fueled capacity would be about 20 GW and nuclear capacity about 19 GW.
5.03      Some 12 hydro schemes have been identified for priority development
in the various republics, and a study by the Bank of the inform.ation available
led to the conclusion that the effective choice for the next project lay bet-
ween 4 proposed schemes, including the Project. The balance of advantage
favored Buk Bijela in view of its higher storage capacitv (which would im-
prove system plant mix and overall efficiency in the long-term), its higher
power capacity and energy capability and its associated secondary benefits,
such as irrigation, flood protection., and tourism.
Comparison of Alternatives
5.04      Given that Buk Bijela was the preferred hydro scheme, the consul-
tants compared the total system costs, using the discounted cash flow method,
of meeting demand with and without Buk Bijela (see Annex 20). Two alter-
natives were considered to the "with Buk Bijela" case, based respectively on
substitution of lignite-fired plant and a mixture of lignite and nuclear
plant. Steam plant using imported oil would be less economic in view of the
high price of oil and was not included in the evaluation.
5.05      Using computer simulation methods, three sets of cost streams were
derived for the above alternatives, the main variables being capital costs,
fuel costs, and load growth, although technical requirements, foreign ex-
change costs, unskilled labor requirements, and secondary benefits were also
taken into account.
5.06      The "with Buk Bijela" program has the lowest present value up to a
discount rate of at least 13.7%.  Since the opportunity cost of capital in
Yugoslavia is believed to have a median value of some 9-10%, this indicates
that Buk Bijela represents the least cost means of meeting the forecast power
consumption on the main assumptions used for the comparison.
5.07      This conclusion was tested for sensitivity to different values for
the variables referred to in 5.05 above. The results indicate that the choice
of Buk Bijela is relatively insensitive to these changes. Thus, valuing for-
eign exchange 20% higher raises the discount rate up to which Buk Bijela is
the least cost choice to 14.4%; assuming capital costs 20% higher lowers it to
12.6/; variations of t15% in the annual load growrth assumed raises or lowers
the rate by one percent point; assuming higher lignite (+20%) and nuclear fuel
costs (+32%) raises the rate to 15%.



- 17 -
Economic Return on Project
5.08      The internal economic rate of return (IER) on the Project is esti-
mated to be at least 11.2% if benefits are measured by incremental revenues
from power sales attributable to the Project, plus the net secondary benefits
associated with the Project, and if financial costs are adjusted for taxes,
internal transfers, sunk costs and shadow-pricing of unskilled labor (see
Annex 20). However, the incremental revenues understate the benefits since
electricity prices have hitherto failed to keep pace with the rate of general
inflation and it is considered that they could be increased significantly
without reducing demand. Sensitivity tests indicated that, with 20% higher
tariffs, the IER would be 13.3%. If foreign exchange is valued at US$1 = Din
19.2 (instead of Din 16), the IER is 10.3%. Only if the capital costs of the
Project are assumed 20% higher does the IER fall below 10% (to 9.5%).
6. FINANCE
Background
6.01      Until December 21, 1973, there were six independent enterprises
responsible for generation and transmission of electric power in Bosnia-
Herzegovina. Each enterprise prepared its own accounts and managed its fi-
nancial affairs separately from the other. There was, therefore, no coordina-
tion of financial planning or consolidation of accounts at the Republican
level. As a result, the availability of historical financial information
on which to base financial projections for Elektroprivreda was limited and
dispersed among each of the former enterprises.
6.02      In the absence of consolidated historical financial accounts at
the time of the appraisal, Elektroprivreda prepared a rough consolidation of
the income accounts and balance sheets for the years 1972 and 1973 by combin-
ing the statements for each of the former enterprises. Where information was
available inter-enterprise transactions were offset to prevent double count-
ing.
6.03      Elektroprivreda's joint program of construction with its 17 associat-
ed basic organizations, estimated to cost about Din 25 billion (US$1.6 billion
equivalent), will be the first coordinated program to be financed within the
reorganized power sector in Bosnia-Herzegovina. It is being undertaken in
conjunction with the creation of the necessary administrative and legal frame-
work under the self-managing communities of interest.
Past Performance and Present Position
6.04      The income accounts for 1972 and 1973 (Annex 21) show rates of re-
turn of about 5%. Sales of electricity in 1973, a dry year, increased only
about 3% above 1972 levels while the corresponding revenues increased about
24% as a result of tariff increases of 12% in March 1973 and a further 14% in



- 18 -
August of the same year. These increases appear to have met only the increas-
ed cost of fuel in 1973 and rising costs due to local inflation.  Depreciation
averaged 3.7% of gross fixed assets in operation; the minimum rates prescribed
by federal law were applied. Interest on debt averaged about 3.3% per annum.
6.05       The balance sheet for 1973 (Annex 22) shows gross fixed assets in
operation of Din 6,384 million comprising 52% hydro plant, 17% thermal plant,
17% transmission assets and 14% remaining assets. On completion, fixed assets
are recorded at construction cost. As at December 31, 1971 all fixed assets
were revalued in accordance with federal law to reflect current market values.
Similarly, the corresponding provisions for depreciation were revalued and the
net result reflected in the business fund. In the case of imported equipment
financed by foreign currency loans, exchange rate differences arising from
changes in the par value of the Yugoslav currency were taken into account in
the revaluation of fixed assets. A new revaluation of fixed assets was made
at the end of the 1974 financial year based on revaluation coefficients pre-
pared by the Federal Statistics Institute. Annual revaluation appears likely
in the future.
6.06       Long-term debt as at the end of 1973, totalling Din 2,580 million
is repayable over an average term of 36 years. About 44% of this amount
was obtained from the Yugoslav Investment Bank prior to 1962 at rates of
interest of 1-2%, repavable over 50 years. Since 1962, long-term loans have
been provided by local banks and Federal Funds on less attractive but still
very reasonable terms (15-30 years at 2-4% interest). Future lending is
expected to be at higher rates of interest and generally to have shorter
repayment periods.
6.07       Accounts receivable represent about 83 days sales and as of October
1974 this figure had increased to about the equivalent of 90 days sales. This
is surprising in view of the 12% penalty interest rate charged on overdue
accounts and Elektroprivreda's requirement that customers pay electricity
accounts within 10 days of the account being rendered. The level of out-
standings is expected to fall in 1975 to about the equivalent of 50 days
sales which would be considered a reasonable level.
6.08       Elektroprivreda, being a new work organization, has many problems
yet to be solved before adequate financial accounting can be obtained (the
present system is described in Annex 23). No procedures yet exist for conso-
lidation of financial statements of the basic organizations. Management in-
formation systems need to be developed to provide Elektroprivreda with prompt
and regular information on operations, financial performance, and construction
costs. Up to the time of the Bank's appraisal they had not prepared financial
forecasts to show their proposed plans for financing the construction program.
Accordingly, Elektroprivreda will engage consultants (preferably as an exten-
sion to the management study being undertaken for borrowers under the trans-
mission loan 836-YU), in accordance with terms of reference and conditions
acceptable to the Bank no later than December 31, 1975, for a management study
to examine and make recommendations for the organization, training (see 3.13)
and administrative and management procedures, and to assist in implementing



- 19 -
the recommendations. Elektroprivreda will discuss with the Bank actions it
proposes to take as a result of the management study. An outline of the pro-
posed terms of reference is provided in Annex 24.
Financing Plan
6.09      Elektroprivreda's forecast sources and applications of funds for the
years 1974 to 1980 is given in Annex 25. A condensed version for the years
1974-79 covering the Project construction period, is given below:

6.10      The financing plan for the construction program including the Proj-
ect has been based on current prices using the escalation rates stated in
4.03.
6.11      The 1973-80 construction program, as adopted by the basic organiza-
tions and included in the self-management agreement establishing Elektro-
privreda (see 3.01), was considered by the Repub:Lican Executive Council on
February 8, 1973, and on December 12, 1973, the Republican Assembly accepted
the program and the recommendation of the Executive Council on the ways and
means by which it might be financed.
6.12       The financing plan is tentative and still to be confirmed by the
republican government. It shows that 33% of the funds required during the
construction period are expected to be provided from internal sources, 11%
from consumers contributions, and the remaining .56% from borrowing. The repub-
lican government has already agreed that 35% of the construction costs of
Elektroprivreda's 1973-80 program shQuld be provided from internal sources'.
For Yugoslavia as a whole it has been agreed thai: a minimum of 30% of construc-
tion expenditures to 1980 should be financed from internal sources. This
agreement between the Republics and the Federation will be reflected in legis-
lation.
6.13       Internal cash generation comprises the free funds of the basic
organizations (those that will not be needed for their own construction
programs), which will be collected and pooled by Elektroprivreda and re-lent
to its associated organizations having insufficient funds from their own
internal sources. These pooled resources will be lent over 25 years for hydro-
electric plants and over 15 years for transmission or thermal plants subject
to interest at 6%. The BOALs which contribute funds to the pool will be re-
paid over 20 years at 6%. In practice repayments to the BOALs from the pool
may be reinvested in the pool. A separate self-management agreement 1/ ac-
ceptable to the Bank containing provisions for the pooling of funds and des-
cribing the internal resources which may be pooled has been prepared by
Elektroprivreda. As a condition of effectiveness, Elektroprivreda should
confirm that a self-management agreement substanitially in accordance with the
accepted draft, has been signed by all the basic organizations.
6.14      To assist the financing of the program by increasing available in-
ternal sources of funds, the republican government has already taken the
following steps subject to the provision that the funds will be used exclu-
sively to finance the program:
(a)  income tax payable by all generation and transmission basic
organizations has been waived during the years 1974-80 in-
clusive, providing an estimated Din 500 million and
1/   "Self-Management Agreement on Pooling and Uses of Resources for Expanded
Production."



- 21 -
(b) debt service payment on 60% of existing debt (see 6.06) has
been deferred until the end of 1980, making available Din 78
million a year or about Din 549 million to 1980.
6.15      During negotiations, the Bank was informed that legislation to
provide additional funds was being considered and was to be enacted before
the end of May 1975. This legislation would comprise a surcharge of 0.1 dinars
per Wh sold within the Republic, expected to provide Din 3.6 billion by 1980,
and a tax payable by all industries (except power) of 1.4% of their business
funds, expected to provide about Din 2.7 billion. These funds are to be
pooled with the Social Accounting Service (SAS) and made available to finance
new construction in the republic in the form of loans repayable over 15 years
at 4% interest. The loans will be repayable to the industries on the same
terms and the surcharges will be retained as equity contributions from con-
sumers. These loans and surcharges are each expected to provide 11% of the
funds required to 1979. As mentioned in 4.05, the adoption of decisions by
the Republic to provide these funds is a condition of effectiveness.
6.16      Firm sources of finance are assured for the planned thermal projects
and the hydroelectric projects, Buk Bisela Trebinje II, and Capljina, and the
380-kV Transmission I. The cost overrun on the 380-kV project (Loan 836-YU)
is being financed by the Federal Republic of Germany. The two borrowers in
Bosnia-Herzegovina will receive about US$30 million on concessional terms.
Foreign currency loans- are still being sought for the hydroelectric plants:
Salakovac, Grabovica, Mostar, and the 380-kV Transmission Stage II. The first
two mentioned are already delayed because of the difficulty of obtaining
foreign currency. Suppliers' credits for Bocac, 110-kV and 220-kV transmis-
sion, dispatch system, other future transmission expansion and thermal sta-
tions have yet to be arranged.
6.17       The foreign currency loans and suppliers' credits still required
total Din 4.3 billion (US$267 million equivalent), about 59% of the esti-
mated foreign cost of the program.  Nevertheless, the republican Government,
Elektroprivreda and its basic organizations expect to find the means to com-
plete all projects in the program by 1980. In the event of a shortage in
financing, the Republic of Bosnia-Herzegovina has confirmed that it will take
all such measures as may be required to provide Elektroprivreda with funds
required to complete the Project and the balance of the 1973-80 construction
program.
6.18       Debt service on most borrowings for the program other than the pro-
posed Bank loan is deferred until the expiration of the contracted guarantee
period for each project and the completion of loan disbursements. During the
period of construction, interest accrued is added to the cost of the Project
and also to the amount of each loan. In the case of the Bank loan, and other
debt service obligations, Elektroprivreda and its basic organizations have ar-
ranged to set aside from income from electricity sales sufficient funds to
meet the debt service commitments prior to any distribution to the basic or-
ganizations. Under depreciation law, each basic organization is permitted to
use 50% of its annual depreciation allowances to obtain foreign currency from
the National Bank of Yugoslavia in order to meet debt service commitments.

Financial Forecasts
6.19      The financial forecasts 1974-80 are presented in Annexes 21, 22
and 25, and the notes and assumptions on which the forecasts are based are
contained in Annex 26. Electricity tariffs were increased 30% in April 1974
and the forecasts provide for an expected tariff increase of a further 30%
and an increase in coal prices of 40% commencing April 1975.  Thereafter
tariff increases of at least 15%/a will be necessary through 1978 to meet
expected increases in operating expenses arising from inflation and at the
same time to provide adequate internal cash generation to meet the financial
covenant in 6.22.
6.20      Electricity sales are expected to increase about 2.6 times from
an estimated 5,964 GWh in 1973 to 15,260 GWh by 1980. The corresponding rev-
enues will increase from Din 1.1 billion to Din 7.6 billion. Operating in-
come will rise from Din 404 million in 1974 to a peak of Din 1,294 million
in 1979 before declining to Din 808 million in 1980 principally as a result
of depreciation being charged for a full year onI most of the new plant which
is expected to be operating by 1980.
6.21      The total expenditure of Din 25.8 billion (including interest pay-
able during construction) on construction (Din 4.2 billion or 16% for Buk
Bijela) will increase the value of gross fixed assets in service to more
than 5 times the 1973 level to Din 34.2 million. However, after revaluation
to refleet expected increases in the general level of prices, gross fixed as-
sets are expected to be valued at Din 50.5 billion as of December 31, 1980.
Total borrowing of Din 15.1 billion will increase long-term debt to Din 15.6
billion, 6 times the 1973 level. Nevertheless, the debt/equity ratio is
expected to improve from 43/57 in 1973 to 38/62 by the end of 1980.
6.22      The forecasts show a rate of return averaging about 5%.  If the
revenue surcharges (see 6.15) are included as part of operating income the
average rate of return is about 7.5%. Further, if an adjustment is made for
the accelerated depreciation charged on assets used in two or more shifts
(Annex 26, para. 2) the average rate of return is about 9%. This latter
figure represents a reasonable rate of return and reflects more adequately
than the other calculations the true financial rate of return. Even though
the adjusted rate of return in 1980 is low (6.5%) it should not be viewed
with concern in view of the uncertainty about cash needs for future expan-
sion and because the tariff adjustment mechanism (see 6.23) is designed to
ensure a reasonable level of internal funds will be available to meet future
expansion. The forecasts show that Elektroprivreda will finance about 33%
of its expansion needs from internal sources during the "construction period
of the Project and 34% to 1980. If the revenue surcharged are included as
part of internal cash generation, the contribution to investment requirements
from internal sources will be 47% - a very adequate level. For the purpose
of preparation of the forecasts the surcharges have not been treated as rev-
enue in the income statement because they are pooled by the SAS (see 6.15)
for financing the construction program and are not available to meet operat-
ing costs. However, to the customers of Elektroprivreda they represent a
direct increase in the electricity tariffs.



- 23 -
6.23      Financial undertakings similar to those under the loan for trans-
mission (836-YU) have been repeated in the Loan Agreement with Elektroprivreda.
These provide that Elektroprivreda will apply tariffs for the sale of electri-
city at such levels as to provide revenues:
(a) sufficient to cover, in any given year, operating expenses
including wages, depreciation, and interest; and in addition
(b) to meet, in any given year, repayments of debt to the extent
that such repayments exceed the provision for depreciation,
and
(c) to produce a surplus of internal funds sufficient to cover
an average of at least 35% of the cost of expansion of the
Borrower's power facilities and interest payable during con-
struction and working capital requirements, during each plan
period of the Guarantor (currently 5 years).
The covenant would apply for the period of the proposed loan. Also Elektro-
privreda will furnish to the Bank annually, not less than 6 months after the
close of each financial year, financial statements and forecasts indicating
measures to be taken to meet these financial objectives. The Republic has
confirmed that it will enable Elektroprivreda to institute such measures.
6.24      In addition, the Borrower will exchange views with the Bank before
making any modification to the 1973-80 Investment Program which would result
in a cost variation in excess of Din 100 million.
6.25      In the context of sound financial and public utility practice
Elektroprivreda will use its best efforts to maintain a uniform depreciation
policy and is expected to resume normal debt service payments as they fall
due after 1980 (see 6.12).
6.26      Debt service coverage is expecLed to decline from a high of 4.4
in 1974 to 2.0 by 1980. The application of clauses (a) and (b) of the fi-
nancial covenant should ensure adequate debt service coverage in 1980 and
future years.
Insurance
6.27      Each basic organization of Elektroprivreda arranges its own insur-
ance with the insurance organizations established within,Bosnia-Herzegovina.
In each instance the extent of coverage is determined by the Workers' Council
of each basic organization. Insurance coverage is taken against risks normally
covered by public utility companies (machinery breakdown, fire, burglary and
public liability) and assets are insured for their full replacement value.
Contractors are required by law to carry their own insurance. Although
nsurance arrangements are considered satisfactory, the Bank advised Elektro-
privreda to review the extent of insurance coverage with each basic organiza-
tion to ensure that excessive premiums were not being paid to obtain full pro-
tection against minor claims, as compared with normal insurance practices in
Yugoslavia.

Audit
6.28      Annual financial statements in Yugoslavia are subject to audit by
the Social Accounting Service (SAS). The scope and quality of their audits
have previously been considered not adequate to meet the Bank's audit require--
ments. Most Yugoslav institutions are not audited every year and the audits
are not concerned with certain aspects which the Bank would regard as import-
ant, such as verification of assets or confirmation of accounts receivable.
The audit certificate principally confirms only the arithmetical accuracy of
the statements and that financial transactions comply with Yugoslav law. Re-
cently, however, a group of SAS auditors has received intensive instruction
and in-service training in modern auditing methods under the direction of
Coopers and Lybrand (U.K.), international auditors. This training was com-
menced largely at the Bank instigation, and progress has been closely monitor-
ed and progressively discussed with the Bank, the purpose being to create a
special audit group within SAS capable of carrying out comprehensive audit,s
acceptable to the Bank.
6.29      Elektroprivreda and Drina will request the SAS to undertake audits
of sufficient scope and quality to meet Bank requirements and to submit
audited financial statements and the auditors' report to the Bank within four
months of the end of each year for the period of the loan. Beginning with
the accounts for the year ending December 31, 1976, they will request that
the audit be undertaken by the special audit group of the SAS. Should audits
not be executed to the satisfaction of the Bank, Elektroprivreda will engage
other auditors acceptable to the Bank.
7. AGREEMENTS REACHED
7.01      During negotiations, agreement was reached on the following prin-
cipal issues:
(a) Should Drina, upon completion of Buk B-Ljela, transfer the
assets to a new basic organization to be established at
such time, it will exchange views with the Bank on such
transfer, which will occur under arrangements acceptable
to the Bank (3.10);
(b) Elektroprivreda, in making power supply agreements outside
the regular tariff schedule, will charge prices adequately
reflecting the estimated costs of supply and ensure that
such agreements include provisions for future price adjust-
ments in the light of increases in the costs of supply
(3.15);



- 25 -
(c) Elektroprivreda will include annually in its Progress Report
for the Project a set of statistical data and monitoring
indicators, including, to the extent possible, those for the
past 5 years (3.18);
(d) Drina will continue to employ consultants whose qualifications,
experience, and terms and conditions of employment shall be
satisfactory to the Bank (and Elektroprivreda), for prepara-
tion of bid documents, evaluation of the bids, and supervision
of construction of the Project (4.06);
(6) Drina will, under arrangements satisfactory to the Bank, cause
the hydroworks, including the dams, to be inspected regularly
in accordance with sound engineering practices (4.07);
(f) Elektroprivreda will undertake a study of the fishery resources
of the portion of the Drina river within Bosnia-Herzegovina,
assisted by consultants acceptable to the Bank in accordance
with terms of reference acceptable to the Bank, and to discuss
the results of the study with the Bank. The expert(s) for this
purpose will be engaged prior to December 31, 1975, for comple-
tion of the study within one year (4.10);
(g) Elektroprivreda will engage consultants for a management study,
under terms of reference and conditions acceptable to the Bank,
and Elektroprivreda, no later than December 31, 1975, and will
discuss with the Bank any actions it proposes to take as a re-
sult of the study (6.08);
(h) The Republic of Bosnia-Herzegovina has confirmed that it will
take all such measures as may be required to provide the funds
required to complete the Project and the 1973-1980 construction
program (6.17);
(i) Elektroprivreda will apply tariffs for the sale of power at
such levels as to provide revenues (i) sufficient to cover,
in any given year, operating expenses, including wages, depre-
ciation, and interest; and in addition (ii) to meet, in any
given year, repayments of debt to the extent that such repay-
ments exceed the provision for depreciation, and (iii) to produce
a surplus of internal funds to cover an average of at least
35% of the cost of expansion of the Borrowers' power facilities,
interest payable during construction and working capital require-
ments. The covenant should be applied to each successive plan
period of the Guarantor for the period of the proposed loan.
Also, Elektroprivreda will furnish to the Bank annually, not less
than 6 months after the close of each financial year, financial
statements and forecasts indicating measures to be taken to meet
these financial objectives. The Republic has confirmed that it
will enable Elektroprivreda to institute such measures (6.23);



- 26 -
(j)  Before making any modification to the Investment Program re-
sulcin,g in a cost variation in excess of Din 100 million,
Elektroprivreda will exchange views with the Bank on the pro-
posed modifications (6.24);
(k)  Elektroprivreda will use its best efforts to maintain a
uniform depreciation policy (6.25);
(1)  Elektroprivreda and Drina will request t]he SAS to undertake
audits of sufficient scope and quality to meet Bank require-
ments and to submit audited financial statements and the
auditor's report to the Bank within four months of the end of
each year for the period of the loan. Beginning with 1976,
they will request that the special audit group of the SAS be
responsible. Should such audit not be executed to the satis-
faction of the Bank, Elektroprivreda will engage other auditors
acceptable to the Bank (6.29).
7.02      Before the loan is made effective, it should be confirmed that:
(a)  Elektroprivreda's basic organizations will make available, out
of their free resources, an amount of not less than Din 1,358
billion, for the construction of Buk Bijela (4.05);
(b)  the "Self Management Agreement on Pooling and Use of Resources
for Expanded Production" of Elektroprivreda's Basic Organiza-
tions is in full force and effect (6.13);
(c)  the Republic has adopted decisions to provide Elektroprivreda
with pooled resources, secured through loans from industry
and surcharges on the sale of electricity, for construction of
Buk Bijela (6.15); and
(d)  agreement on mutual rights and obligations (particularly with
respect to execution of the Project), acceptable to the Bank,
has been duly executed between Elektroprivreda and Drina (3.08).
7.03      Subject to the conditions of effectiveness described in para 7.02,
the Project is suitable for a Bank loan of US$70 million to Elektroprivreda
Bosne i Hercegovina, Sarajevo with the guarantee of the Socialist Federal
Republic of Yugoslavia, a substantial portion of which is to be made available
to Hidroelektrane Na Drini, Sarajevo. Based on the assumed useful life for
a hydroelectric plant and the estimated construction time, an appropriate
term for the loan is 25 years including 5 years of grace.

Definitions from the Constitution of the Socialist
Federal Republic of Yugoslavia (1974 ed)
1.        Associated Labor - is a Yugoslav economic and legal category denot-
ing economic and non-economic activities performed with socially-owned re-
sources and organized on the principles of self-management.
2.        Organization of Associated Labor - is a generic term for those
economic and non-economic organizations which carry out their activities with
socially-owned resources and are organized on a self-management basis. This
is in fact what was earlier referred to as an "enterprise" (for the economic
sector) and an `institution'  (for the non-economic sector).
3.        Basic Organization of Associated Labor - is a component part of an
organization of associated labor which makes up a technologically rounded
whole, an independent economic and self-managing unit which can have the
character of a legal entity. (Basic organizations of associated labor were
earlier referred to as work units, plants, or independent departments in non-
economic organizations).
4.        Self-Management Agreements - are self-management enactments adopted
on terms of equality by workers in work organizations and working people in
local communities, communities of interest and other self-managing organiza-
tions, with a view to regulating and adjusting their interests (a more rational
division of labor, pooling of resources for the pursuance of common aims, re-
gulation of mutual relations in this cooperation, etc.). In this way the re-
gulative and intermediary role of the state concerning relations among working
people is diminished. A self-management agreement is only binding on those
who have signed or acceded to it.
5.        Self-Managing Communities of Interest - are communities formed by
working people directly or through their self-managing organizations and
communities for the purpose of satisfaction of specific common needs. Their
aim is to link the interests of those who render specific public services
with those who use these services. Under the Constitution, the assemblies
of self-managing communities of interest in the spheres of education, science,
culture, health and welfare are authorized to decide, together and on an equal
footing with the competent assemblies of the socio-political communities (com-
munes, provinces, republics), on matters falling within these spheres. There
are also communities of interests in the fields of housing construction, power
production, water management, transport, etc.



ANNEX 1
Page 2 of 2
6.        Work Organization - is an independent self-managing organization
of workers linked in labor by common interests and organized in basic organi-
zations  of associated labor of which the work organization is composed, or
workers linked together through the unity of labor process.
7.        Composite Organizations of Associated Labor - are a form of organiza-
tion of associated labor established through the merger of several work organ-
izations or basic organizations of associated labor operating within them.
Composite organizations of associated labor are also referred to as associated
enterprises.

NOTES
1.  Figures to 1980 are JUGEL projections based on forecasts of individual republics.  Figures for later years are extracted or
derived from consultants' feasibility study.
2.  Annual exports and imports are assumed to balance each other out during the period.
3.  Maximum demand figures are highest annual hourly averages.  The figures for 1981-85 assume continuance of the 1980 system
load factor of 68%.

Summary of the Law Governing the Electrical Industry
in Bosnia-Herzegovina - dated April 26, 1974
I.   General Regulations
The electrical industry in Bosnia-Herzegovina comprises the organi-
zations of associated labor engaged in production, transmission and distribu-
tion of electric power. These organizations, together with their self-manag-
ing communities of interest, due to their importance and the role they play
in the development of industry and society, are considered to be of special
social interest.
The basic organizations in the electrical industry and electricity
consumers are obliged to form self-managing communities of interest to self-
manage their mutual relationships and coordinate plans and programs for in-
creasing energy capacity.
II. Special Social Interest
- is realized by the basic organizations in the electrical industry
by obtaining the approval of the District Assemblies to their statutes and
self-management agreements, their development program and to their organs of
management.-
III. Self-Managing Communities of Interest
Electrical industry organizations and consumers are to form a self-
managing community of interest in Bosnia-Herzegovina and basic self-managing
communities of interest.
The basic self-managed community of interest is established for
a region of one or more communities and comprises representatives from:
(1) basic organizations engaged in distribution of power;
(2) basic organizations and working communities who consume power;
and
(3) citizens who are consumers.



ANNEX 9
Page 2 of 5
The self-managing community of interest of the power industry in
Bosnia-Herzegovina has a self-management agreement: and a statute which regu-
lates the tasks of the basic self-managing communities of interest, their
organization, authority, responsibility and method of election of officials.
Decisions of the self-managing community of interest in Bosnia-
Herzegovina which regulate development programs, financing of these programs,
determination of the power balance and electricity tariffs are made by dele-
gates of the electrical industry voting separately from consumers. A decision
is accepted only if it is supported by a majority of delegates from both the
electrical industry and consumers.
The self-managed community of interest of the electrical industry of
Bosnia-Herzegovina resolves matters of importance to the industry, consumers
and society particularly:
(1) the long-term program for development of generation and
transmission capacities;
(2) financing of long-term programs;
(3) determines electric power balances for Bosnia-Herzegovina;
(4) determines tariff rates for transmission and distribution;
(5) conditions for delivery of power.
If the community cannot provide all the necessary funds for financ-
ing the program, then these matters will be resolved by law at the Republican
level. If the community otherwise does not resolvre matters relating to the
power balance, tariffs etc. then they will be determined by the Republican
Assembly.
Basic self-managing communities of interest which are engaged in
the distribution of power with consumers have the following tasks:
(1)  determine long-term programs of development and plans for
construction of distribution projects for their region;
(2)  determine financing of long-term constrLCtion programs;
(3) coordinate programs of development for clistribution with
those for transmission and generation irL the region;
(4) determine contributions for connection of new consumers;,
(5) establish tariffs for distribution consumers.



ANNEX 9
Page 3 of 5
The main organ of the self-managing community of interest in the
electrical industry in Bosnia-Herzegovina comprises the Assembly, whose
delegates are the workers from the basic organizations - either in the elec-
trical industry, or consumers. The delegates are appointed 50% from workers
in the industry (1/3 from distribution organizations) and 50% from consumers
- the number of delegates depends on the value of power consumed.
The main organ of the basic self-managing communities of interest
in the electrical industry is also an Assembly constituted similarly to the
self-managing community of interest of Bosnia-Herzegovina. The self-managing
communities of interest have their own statutes which determine the other
organs of the community or association, their jurisdiction, sources of funds,
etc. The statute of the Assembly in Bosnia-Herzegovina is approved by the
Republican Assembly and that of basic communities by the District Assembly.
IV. Operation of the Electric Industry
(a) Conditions for supply of electricity -
Power is delivered to distribution and industrial consumers, in ac-
cordance with the terms of a written contract and distribution organizations
sell their power following an application by the consumer. Contracts for the
bulk consumers must be concluded each year by the 30th of November or at least
30 days before expiration of the existing contract.
(b) Connection of consumers -
Connection of a new industrial consumer, or increasing supply to an
industrial consumer, is carried out in accordance with a contract relating to
such matters. The technical conditions for supply are determined by the
supplier. The contracts to industrial consumers must be concluded or approval
obtained prior to construction. For the purpose of ensuring the safety of
the power system, its consumers and property, the electrical industry organiza-
tions are obliged by November 30 of the current year to prepare a coordinated
plan to overhaul and update power facilities.
Local communities through contributions of citizens and organiza-
tions of associated labor may construct electric power projects to electrify
their particular region.
(c) Electric Power Balance -
The electrical industry organizations prepare the annual electrical
power balances from estimates of available generation and contracts for the

Description of Project
Background
1.        Since 1969 a Drina River Basin Development Study has been in execu-
tion, financed by the three riparians (Bosnia-Herzegovina, Serbia and Monte-
negro), which is expected to be completed in 1975. Already a broad outline
of some 25 additional dams and power stations to be constructed has resulted
from this study, which would provide detailed recommendations for the overall
water use for all purposes, including power, and division between the ripar-
ians. The studv would not make recommendations for economic ranking of dams
and power stations to be completed; the riparians, each of whom would decide
on the program and timing of development within its own republic, have not
yet decided on a course of action for assessing an economic merit order.
2.        Buk Bijela would, chronologically, constitute the 6th step (and the
first to be completed in Bosnia-Herzegovina) in the preliminary long range
development plan for power developments on the Drina and its tributaries,
which would regulate practically the whole river basin (catchment area 19,750
km2). Potential developments in the basin total 3.5-4 GW and 15 TWh, compared
with Yugoslavia's estimated exploitable hydro potential of some 17 GW and 64
TW4h of which some 17-18 TWh is presently being exploited.
3.        In the basin, the following hydro plants (aggregating an installed
capacity of 622 MW and an average annual energy of 2,733 GWh) are already in
operation:
-    Bajina Basta in Serbia on the Drina river (Bank Loan 318-YU);
360 MW, 1,638 GWh, live storage 280x106m3, annual average
flow 349 m3/s.
-    Zvornik in Serbia on the Drina River; 85 MW, 471 GWh, live
storage 23x106m3, annual average flow 403 m3/s.
-    Kokin Brod/Bistrica in Serbia on the Uvac river; 123 MW,
395 GWh (in two plants, diversion to river Lim), live storage
220x106m3, annual average flow 124.5 m3/s.
-    Potpec in Serbia on the Lim river; 54 MW, 229 GWh, live
storage 25x106m3, annual average flow 80.6 m3/s.



ANNEX 16
Page 2 oL 5
Scheduled for completion in 1975 is:
-    Mratinje in Montenegro on the Piva river; 342  SW, 870 GWh,
live storage 790x106m3, annual average flow 74.4 m3/s.
4.        Studies for the Buk Bijela Hydro Develcpment were initiated about
20 years ago and extensive topographic and geological surveys, tests, borings,
pilot excavations, grouting tests, laboratory tests, etc. have been made.
Elektroprivreda and its consultants (Energoinvest of Sarajevo) have concluded
that Buk Bijela should have an installed capacity of 450 MW with an annual
generation of 1,104 GWh, as a result of a computer simulation of the monthly
operation of the projected power plants on the Tara and Piva rivers (which
together with the smaller Sutjeska river form the upper tributaries of the
Drina) based on 40 years of recorded stream flows (1925-64). Originally the
dam crest was designed at about elevation 550 m (150 m above riverbed), but
as a result of an optimization study - forming part of the overall Drina
basin study - of the three hydroplants (Mratinje on the Piva, Bijela Breg on
the Tara, and Buk Bijela on the Drina) projected near the confluence of the
three rivers, the dam crest was decreased to El 503 m. In view of the high
annual river discharges (2,350x106m3/year at Mratinje, 2,390x106m3/year at
Bijela Breg, and 5,550x106m3/year at Buk Bijela) in comparison with the res-
tricted storage possibilities, all plants will be of the peaking type. Be-
cause of the rapid operational changes, a compensating reservoir is required
below Buk Bijela to protect the river bed and the downstream town of Foca.
Description of Project
5.        Buk Bijela Plant and Reservoir - The Bulk Bijela dam would be located
334.5 km upstream from the confluence of the Drina and Sava river (which is a
tributary of the Donau), some 12 km upstream of the town of Foca; a weir-type
construction with discharge gates would be located 10 km downstream of the
Buk Bujela dam to form a compensating reservoir. The Buk Bijela plant would
comprise:
(a) a rock fill dam with clay core across the Drina;
(b) two spillways, one on the left bank and one on the right bank;
(c) intakes on the right bank connecting to two tunnels, each
bifurcating to feed two turbines;
(d) a cavern type powerhouse on the right bank witn entrance
tunnel;
(e) two tailrace tunnels on the right bank, each with an under-
ground surge tank;
(f) a drainage tunnel on the left Bank; and
(g) a 220-kV/380-kV switchyard on the left bank, 800 m downstream
from the dam.



ANNEX 16
Page 3 of 5
6.        The Buk Bijela dam will have a maximum height of 103 m and crest
at 503 m above sea level; it will require about 2,750,000 m3 of fill, and its
crest length will be about 200 m. To the maximum possible extent the dam will
use material from required excavation; other materials are available within
1.5 km of the dam site, gravel and clay are within an area of about 5 km
around the site. An inspection gallery (including all facilities for contin-
uously monitoring dam soundness and movements) will be provided running from
inside the left bank through the interface clay core/rockfill into the right
bank. The grouting curtain, which would have area of about 85,000 m2, goes
down to about 80 m below dam foundation.  The dam will form a reservoir with
the following dimensions at El 500 m, its maximum operating level:
(a)  surface area 11.8 km2;
(b)  length, some 15 km, up to Mratinje on the Piva river;
(c)  storage:  live volume 328xlO6m3 between normal operating limits
El 500 and El 460, and 85x106m3 below El 460;
(d) the spillways, will have each a control structure with two
radial gates, each 15x10 m (the latter including flap of
2.4 m) and a chute; at maximum reservoir level (El 502 m),
the spillways will have a combined capacity to discharge
4,700 m2/s, which would provide protection against a flood
occurring once in 10,000 years; and
(e)  a bottom outlet tunnel with 2 sliding gates at the passing
point with the clay core (with access tunnel at the downstream
side of the dam), steel lining in the downstream part, and a
radial gate at the outlet.
7.        The power facilities will consist of two intake structures each
with trash racks and sliding gate, two pressure tunnels each bifurcating (at
the point of passing the clay core) in two steel-lined penstock tunnels, and
four 112.5 MW units. The vertical-shaft Francis-type turbines will each be
rated at 156,000 metric horsepower (114.8 MW), 150 rpm at 84 m net head for
150 m3/s. The generators will be rated 125 MVA, 50 Hz, 15 kV and 0.9 power
factor. They will each be unit-connected to a 125 MVA, 15/410-kV, 3-phase
(Yd 5 connected), two-winding transformer, with water cooled forced oil circu-
lation. The transformers will be located in caverns at both sides of the
entrance tunnel adjacent to the power house. Two turbines each will discharge
via a surge tank to a combined tailrace tunnel with stoplog facilities at the
outlet.
8.        The transformers will be connected in pairs to the switchyard by
means of single phase 380-kV cables (800 m long). The switchyard will com-
prise a 380-kV and a 220-kV double busbar system. The 380'-kV section will
be connected to a single circuit 380-kV line to Sarajevo (Loan 836-YU) and,
at a later stage to a similar line to Zvornik; two spare line sections will



ANNEX 16
Page 4 of 5
be available for future extensions. The 220-kV section will be connected to
the 380-kV section by means of 3 (+1 spare) single phase regulating auto-
transformers 135/135/45 MVA 400 ± 5%/231/31/5 kV. Two outgoing lines will
provide connection with the existing 220-kV system at Mratinje.
Foca Dam and Reservoir
9.        The concrete dam near Foca would be constructed 10 km downstream of
Buk Bijela; it would comprise two top radial gates of 13x11 m, two bottom
radial gates of 13x9 m, together allowing for maximum flood discharge, and
stoplog facilities. The dam will form a reservoir of about 7x106m3 with a
surface area of about 1.1 km2 at the normal level of El 405 (riverbed at El
385). The future construction of a small hydroplant (about 8 MW) at this dam
appears feasible. Its principal purpose, however, is to compensate for the
rapidly fluctuating Buk Bijela discharge thus protecting the riverbed, the
town of Foca, and various facilities on the downstream banks.
Diversion Works
10.       For diversion purpose, the following facilities will be constructed;
(a) two diversion tunnes 1 (one on each bank), aLlowing for a discharge of
2,000 m2/s, which would provide protection against a flood occurring once in
20 years, (b) upstream cofferdam cresting at El 435, with impervious core,
which will be incorporated in the main dam, (c) similar downstream cofferdam
cresting at El 415 m - the level of the future entrance platform of the
access tunnel to the power house.
Environmental Impact
11.       About 1,360 ha (13.6 km2) of land will be flooded, i.e.
-    562 ha of forests
-    416 ha of cultivated land
-    382 ha of unfertile land
12.       The following facilities and people would be relocated:
-    a 12.5 km section of the road from Kapilovi to Scepan Polji,
-    a 2.5 km forest railroad,
-    a 4 MW thermal private power plant,
-    3 schools,
-    3 shops and 3 warehouses,
-    1 church with graveyard,
-    136 houses with 610 inhabitants.
3.       The legal basis for expropriations and indemnification is the Ex-
propriation Law as published in the Official Gazettte for Bosnia-Herzegovina
No. 35 of 1972. The aim of fair indemnification is to provide a former owner
with about the same economic situation he had prior to flooding of his proper-
ties. At the time of appraisal agreements had been reached with the majority



ANNEX 16
Page 5 of 5
of present owners, in which the Foca Municipality has played and will continue
to play an important role: locations will be provided for reconstructing
public buildings or housing; displaced persons will have employment priority
and children scholarship priority; assistance is provided for buying in the
Foca area properties or land suitable for agricultural development. Total
cost for acquisitions and indemnifications is expected to amount to about
Din 186 million (US$11.6 million).
14.       The upper part of the Drina, where Buk Bijela will be located, re-
presents - with respect to fish - the Salmonidian region, where trout and
amulus abound. The area has no fishing industry, but sport fishing is wide-
spread and growing particularly above Buk Bijela on the Sutjeska, Tara and
Piva rivers. The problems associated with the basin's fishery resources as a
result of the series of dams proposed for the various rivers have not been
studied, except that at Buk Bijela raising brook and lake trout in the
reservoir, as well as coregenus fish is envisaged. A spawning and fish pond
would be constructed for regular stocking of the reservoir, and it is expected
that a fish industry would develop in the area.

Buk Bijela Hydropower Project
Outline of Terms of Reference for
Drina River Fishery Investigation
1.        The construction of the Buk Bijela Hydro-power dam on the Drina
River, Bosnia-Herzegovina, Yugoslavia, poses a potential threat to the river's
sport fishery by altering the physico-chemical characteristics of the water
and thereby contributing to changes in the river's biota which may prove
inimical to the fishery; and, by constituting a barrier to the migratory habits
of part or all of the fishery, particularly the salmonids. Accordingly, a
study should be instituted by competent fishery biologists and associated
experts no later than December 1975, and completed, if possible, within one
year, in order that appropriate changes in the engineering design and/or
operating regime can be carried out, if and as needed.
2.        The study should be directed at a description of the fishery in-
cluding speciation; dynamics of the respective populations; distribution;
migrations; seasonal life rhythms; composition of food chains and feeding
interrelationships; reproduction, and relationships of the fishery to the
separate elements of the abiotic and biotic environment.
In particular, this phase of the study should, to the maximum pos-
sible extent, address itself to and utilize existing data and information,
with a view to filling in important informational lacunae through field in-
vestigations.
3.        The study should further be directed at describing the physico-
chemical composition of the fishery habitat, paying especial attention to
those parameters likely to be altered by the presence and/or operation of the
dam.
4.        The study should have as its principal objective a determination of
the probable effects of the dam and/or the operating regime on the fishery,
including recommendations as to how seriously adverse effects may be prevented
or minimized; e.g., incorporation of a fish ladder to allow unimpeded migra-
tion.
5.        Upon selection of consultants acceptable to the Bank, specific terms
of reference can be provided at that time. In general, the investigations
required will follow a protocol familiar to all fishery biologists engaged
in the study of riverine ecosystems wherein a hydro-power or flood control
dam is planned.

JUSTIFICATION OF PROJECT
1.  MIarket Growth
1.1       The Buk Bijela hydropower station would form part of the inter-
connected power system of Yugoslavia. The trend growth rate of sales in the
system since 1963 has been 10.8% p.a., which is projected to decline to 9.2%
in 1980 and 8.4% p.a. in the period 1980-85. In view of the long life of
power stations (50 years for hydro, 30 years for thermal) it was necessary
to make assumptions about the rate of market growth beyond 1985 as a basis
for system planning and comparison of alternative development programs. The
assumptions adopted by the consultants (Energoprojekt) for this purpose were
that the growth rate of electricity demand would continue its downward trend,
declining to 7.8% in the period 1986-90 and to 5.1% in 1991-2000. The resulting
projected total requirement in 2000 was 240 TWh, compared with 105 TWh in 1985.
On this basis, and assuming that population grows at 0.7% p.a. after 1985 (com-
pared with 0.8% in 1980-85), electricity consumption per capita would double
between 1985 and 2000, rising from 4,600 kWh to about 9,200 kWh.
1.2       There are clearly many uncertainties in making projections for such
long periods of time. To allow for these, alternative projections were also
made for the purpose of the economic analysis, assuming future growth rates of
demand 15% higher and 15% lower than those projected by JUGEL and their con-
sultants.
2.   Alternative Development Strategies
2.1       Past power development in Yugoslavia has been based primarily on the
utilization of the country's resources of hydropower and coal, as illustrated
by the fact that of the 1973 total installed capacity of 7,892 MW in the JUGEL
system only 381 MW (5%) uses liquid fuels. The economic case for this policy
has been strongly reinforced by the oil price explosion of the past year,
since present and projected prices for imported oil (or natural gas), on which
Yugoslavia would have to depend for additional oil(or gas)-fired generating ca-
pacity, put the latter out of the reckoning compared with the alternatives of
hydro, lignite or nuclear stations, even allowing for the lower capital costs
of oil(or gas)-fired stations.
2.2       JUGEL's long-term development strategy, therefore, is based on
progressive exploitation of the country's hydropower and lignite resources,
supplemented by the introduction of nuclear power on a growing scale from 1980
onwards. The program envisages that all the economic hydro potential will be
developed by the year 2000 and that to meet the projected growth of demand
installed thermal capacity in the system will grow as follows:

/1   All lignite/coal except for 381 MW of existing oil-fired capacity and
1,415 MW under construction or planned (including 465 MW of gas turbine
capacity).
2.3       Studies carried out by the individual republics over many years led
to the identification of 12 hydro schemes for priority development. Although
all these schemes will probably be needed to meet the forecast growth of demand
over the next 10 years, they are not all at the same stage of preparation, and
study by the Bank of the information available led to the conclusion that the
effective choice for the next project lay between four of the proposed schemes
viz. Bajina Basta (Serbia), Zur (Kosovo), Grabovica/Salakovac (Bosnia-Herzegovina)
and Buk Bijela (Bosnia-Herzegovina). A Bank preappraisal mission decided that
there were outstanding questions or problems still to be resolved with regard
to the Bajina Basta and Zur schemes and that, as between the remaining two
schemes, although the necessary information for a detailed economic evaluation
was not available, the balance of advantage favored Buk Bijela for the following
reasons:
(a)  its higher storage capacity (320 x 106xr31ive storage against
21 x 106m3 for Grabovica/Salakovac). Ihe proportion of run-
of-the-river plant in the JUGEL system is already high and
increased storage plant development would improve plant mix
and overall efficiency in the long ternm;
(b)  although the capital costs of Buk Bijela may be somewhat
higher, this disadvantage is more than offset by its higher
installed capacity (450 NW against 320 IW for Grabovica/
Salakovac) and energy capability (1122 GWh compared with
940 GWTh);
(c) there would be secondary benefits associated with Buk Bijela
(see 3.5 (g)) but not with Grabovica/Salakovac.
3.   Comparison of Alternatives                            t
3.1       Given that Buk Bijela was the preferred hydro scheme which would be
required by 1980 to meet the forecast load growth, the next step was to compare
this with alternative developments to determine which was the least-cost means
of satisfying the requirement. The feasible technical options available for
iis purpose would be lignite-fired plant and nuclear plant. The method adopted



ANNEX 20
Page 4 of 10
by the consu]tants was to conmpare the total system costs in present-worth terms
of meetina the projected power demand with and without Euk Bijela. This meant
conmparing three cases as fol]lows:
(a)  the development prograli including, Douk; Bijela;
(b)  an alternative prog;ram without Bxk ],ijela for which eniuivalent
linite-firecl plant was substituted,
(c)  another alternative in which the additionial thermal capacity
required in the "without Buk Bijela" case took the forrm of
lignite-fired plant initially (i.e. in 1980) but of nuclear
plant as soon as this became fensible; given that the first
nuclear power station is not due to be installed until 1980,
and a few years' operating experience is envisag ed before
further plants are installed, it was assumed that this would
not be until 1985.
3.2        For the comparison the consultants used a computer model which
simulatecl the operation of the JU(EL interconnected power syster in selected
years (1920, 1985, 1990 and 2000), assurmLing the build-up of hydro, fossil and
nuclear plant described above (see 2.2). Figures for intervening years
were obtained by interpolation. For the purpose of the simulation approximate
monthly load diagrams were derived, each divided into two parts, representing
primary (base-load) and secondary (peak-load) energy respectively (see Attach-
ment 1). In the basic ("with Buk Bijela") case the output, in terms of primary
and secondary energy, of the hydro plants in the system was determined using
hydrological data for the 40-year period 1925-64. The simulation procedure
then provided for the system requirements in excess of the hydro output to be
supplied by the thermal plant in the systen operated in econom!ic merit order,
with due allowance for spinning reserve, standby capacity and scheduled plant
maintenance.
3.3       Next, simulations were carried out of the system in the two "without
Buk Bijela" cases (see 3.1 (b) and (c)) to deter.mine the additional amounts
of thermal capacity and thermal. generation which would be needed in each case
to meet the load requirements if Buk Bijel.a were not installed.  The incremental
costs (capital and operating) of this additional thermal capacity and thermal
generating were then calculated for each case over a period of 50 years (the
estimated life of the Buk Bijela Project).
3.4        By this procedure three cost streams were derived, representin.g
respectively the costs (capital plus operating) associated with the installa-
tion and operation in the JUGEL system of
(a) Buk Bijela;
(b) the incremental lignite-fired capacity which would be required
in the "without Btik Bijela" case, andl



ANNEX 20
Page 5 of 10
(c) the incremental lignite and nuclear capacity which would be
required in the "without Buk Bijela" case if nuclear were given
the preference over lignite plan from 11985 onwards.
A.   Assumptions
3.5       The main variables in the comparison are capital costs, fuel costs
(lignite and nuclear) and load growth, but technical requirements, foreign
exchange, unskilled labor and secondary benefits have been taken into account.
These factors affecting the comparison are summarized as follows:
(a) Capital Costs
For the basic comparison the estimated capital costs (including.
physical contingencies) at 1974 pric(es were used. For Buk Bijela these are
given in Annex 4. For the lignite alternative, t:he consultants' estimate of
7,000 dinars/kW (US$438), which includes an allowance for standby reserve and
station supply, was adopted. The consultants' estimate for the nuclear
alternative (70% above the lignite capital cost) is based on information
about the first Yugoslav nuclear power station recently ordered and is also
reasonably in line with comparative data for 1973 in the "Market Survey for
Nuclear Power in Developing Countries" published by the International Atomic
Energy Agency (IAEA). To allow for uncertainty, the comparison of alternatives
was also made assuming capital costs 20% higher for all alternatives (Buk
Bijela, lignite and nuclear) than in the base case.
(b) Fuel Costs
The consultants adopted the current se:Lling price for lignite for
electricity generation of 51.9 dinars/million kcal, equivalent to about 82
US4/million Btu, which represents a 50% increase above the level ruling prior
to April, 1974. However it appears to be related to average costs of produc-
tion at existing mines and not the marginal costs, of supply to additional
lignite-fired generating capacity. No precise estimate of marginal costs could
be obtained but an expert from the Association of Yugoslav Coal Producers ex-
pressed the view that it was well above the present selling price. To test for
sensitivity, therefore, a cost 20% above the base figure of 51.9 dinars/million
kcal was also assumed. The specific fuel consumption rate assumed (for a 600-MW
station) was 2,450 kcal/kWh sent out.
For the nuclear alternative the consult:ants assumed a fuel cost of
0.04 dinar/kWh, equivalent to about 2.5 US mills/kWh.  This is said to be the
estimate for the first nuclear station recently ordered but it looks low com-
pared with the latest IAEA estimate, which is about 3.3 mills/kWh for a 600-MW
station. The effect on the comparison of alternatives of adopting this higher
figure was therefore also tested.



ANNEX 20
Page 6 of 10
(c) Load Growth
For the base-case comparison of alternatives the main load forecast
for Yugoslavia was used. To allow for uncertainty, comparisons were also
made assuming annual load growth t15% of the rates implied in the main
forecast.
(d) Technical Requirements
The required reserve of generating capacity on the system was assumed
to be made up of spinning reserve equal to the largest unit (hydro or thermal)
running plus standby reserve equal to 15%/ of the thermal capacity in the system.
Shut-down time for annual maintenance was taken as 1 month for
smaller units (up to 150 MW) and 2 months for units over 150 IW.
For hydro stations a 50-year life was assumed; for thermal stations,
a 25-year economic life, followed by 5 years when they were available as
spinning reserve.
For hydro stations, "90% hydraulicity" was assumed i.e. a 90%
probability that the worst possible hydrological conditions, as indicated by
data for the period 1925-64, would occur.
Annual system load factor 1/ was assumed to decline gradually from
about 72% in 1980 to 69% in 2000.
(e) Foreign Exchange
The estimated foreign exchange component (direct and indirect) of
the capital cost of a lignite station is about 70% and the same percentage has
been assumed for a nuclear station. The corresponding estimate for Buk Bijela
is 35%.
Lignite fuel costs will also contain a high foreign exchange com-
ponent, since production will be from open-cast mines using highly capital
intensive methods for which foreign equipment has to be imported. No precise
estimate of the foreign exchange component is available but it is assumed that,
directly and indirectly, it would represent about 50% of the cost of lignite.
Nuclear fuel is likely to be entirely imported in the early years
of the nuclear power program until the amount of capacity is large enough to
justify the construction of fabrication facilities in Yugoslavia. For simplicity
1/   This is not the true system load factor, since it is not based on the
instantaneous peak demand on the system but on the average power demand
during the hour in the year when maximum kWh sales were recorded. The
true system load factor would be lower than the figures given.



ANNEX 20
Page 7 of 10
it was assumed that 100% of nuclear fuel costs would be in foreign exchange to
1990 and that the percentage would fall to 50% t:hereafter.
The Yugoslav dinar is at present floating and the exchange rate at
the time of the Bank mission was around 16 dinars to the US$. This rate has
been used here for the basic comparison of alternatives but for sensitivity
testing a 20% lower value for the dinar has also been used.
(f) Unskilled Labor
There is a surplus of unskilled labor in Bosnia-Hierzegovina and this
is expected to persist over the foreseeable future. A shadow price of half
the money wage was therefore used in valuing the unskilled labor inputs asso-
ciated with each alternative.
(g) Secondary Benefits
Various secondary benefits of the Buk Bijela Project have been iden-
tified as a result of studies carried out by the consultants. These miay be
summiarized as follows:
(i) Irrigation
The Buk Bijela storage dam will be filled in spring and discharged
in summer. As a result, the water available annually for irrigation purposes
is expected to be increased by 7%, sufficient to irrigate 700 ha in 1981, rising
to 21,000 ha in 2000.  The net benefits of irrigation are valued at 810 dinars/
ha, so that the resulting stream of benefits rises from about 600,000 dinars
in 1981 to 17 million dinars in 2000.
(ii) Flood Protection
The Buk Bijela storage works are expected to reduce economic losses
from flooding on the Drina river (through damage to agriculture, buildings etc.)
by about 0.8 million dinars annually on the lower course of the river and 0.6
million dinars on the upper course, giving a total net benefit of 1.4 million
dinars/a.
(iii) Fishing
The Buk Bijela storage is expected to provide favorable conditions
for breeding of Salmonidian fish, notably brook trout, suitable for commercial
and tourist fishing. The estimated net benefit, after deducting capital and
overhead costs of breeding the fish in the storage, is estimated at 250,000
dinars/a. On the other hand, unless special measures are taken, the existing
possibilities for sport fishing for this type of fish in the river are likely
to be adversely affected by the Project. No estimate is available of the cost
of the preventive measures that would be necessary but it is assumed here that
>ey would fully offset the calculated benefits from commercial and tourist
fishing, which have therefore not been credited to the Buk Bijela Project.



ANNEX 20
Page 8 of 10
(iv) Tourism
The Project is situated in an area of great scenic beauty and studies
have suggested that the storage reservoir to be constructed will act as a
special attraction to tourists, particularly since the Belgrade-Dubrovnik road
goes past it. The net benefit is estimated at about 0.7 million dinars in 1980,
rising at 3%/a.
(v) Other
An indirect benefit specific to the thermal alternatives which the
consultants identified is a reduced risk of failure, compared with the "with
Buk Bijela" case, to meet the full forecast demand on the system. This benefit
was quantified and credited to the thermal alternatives, using estimates of the
costs of reduced supply to the various categories of consumers affected. The
value of the benefit ranges from 13 to 18 million dinars/a. There may also
be certain secondary costs (e.g. of pollution) associated with the lignite
alternative but these have not been quantified.
B.   Results of Comparison
3.6       The cost streams associated with each of the 3 development strategies,
on the basic assumptions regarding the values of the main variables, are shown
at Attachment 2. The net present values were calculated over a range of
discount rates from 6% - 18%, and the results for the range 10-16% are shown
in Attachment 2. The results indicated that the "with Buk Bijela" program has
the lowest present value up to a discount rate of 13.7%. Since the opportunity
cost of capital in Yugoslavia is believed to be in the range 6-12% with a
median value of 9%, this indicates that the "with Buk Bijela" case represents
the least cost means of meeting the forecast power requirement on the main
assumptions used for the comparison.
3.7       This conclusion was tested for sensitivity to the different values
for the variables given above. The results, which are summarized in Attach-
ment 3, indicated that the choice of Buk Bijela is relatively insensitive to
these changes.
4.   Economic Return on Project
4.1       The internal economic rate of return (IRR) on the Project is the
discount rate which equalizes the present values of the time-streams of the
attribuable costs and benefits over the Project's life. The costs are the
capital plus operating costs of the Project, as shown in Attachment 2. The
benefits comprise the following items:
(a) the revenues from the sales of power attributable to the
Project; and
(b) the net secondary benefits associated with the Project.



ANNEX 20
Page 9 of 10
The detailed figures are shown iii Attachmnent 4.  The derivation of the second-
ary benefits has been explained above (see 3.5 (g)).  'The method for cal-
culating the benefits from attributable power sales is described below.
4.2       The simulation studies carried out by the consultants using hydro-
logical data for the period 1925-1964 indicated that the average annual
generation (net of station consumption) would be 1104 GWh, made up as follows:
GWh _li%
Primary energy                 53.8        4.9
Secondary energy            1,050.2       95.1
1,104.0      100.0
The distribution of the annual output by months was also determined and hence
how much would be available in the "higher" 1/ and "lower" seasons of the year
as defined in the bulk tariff schedule (see Annex 12).  The allocation of each
month's energy output between "day" and "night" was also calculated, taking
account of the predominance of secondary energy (95%) in Buk Bijela's average
annual output. This resulted in the allocation of the output according to
season and time of day shown in Attachment 5.
4.3       The corresponding revenues at the existing tariffs (without cor-
recting for transmission losses) were then calculated as follows:
(a) Energy
Time of
Season            day             GWh             Din/kWh           Million Dinars
Higher           Day              157.9             0.270                 42.7
Night           110.7              0.162                17.9
Total           268.6                                   60.6
Lower            Day             332.6              0.0945                31.4
Night           502.8              0.0540               27.2
Total           835.4                                   58.6
Total                          1,104.0                                   119.2
(b)  Power
The demand charges for power are 134.69 dinars/kW in the higher
season and 45.80 dinars/kW in the lower season. Applying these rates to the
monthly power outputs of Buk Bijela shown in Attachment 6 gives the following
results:
1/   Higher season includes January, February, September and October.

Lower                         154.9
Total                   302.8
4.4       This results in an annual total of 422 million dinars, which was then
adjusted as follows for transmission losses and transmission costs to obtain
the net revenue from sales attributable to Buk Bijela output:
Million Digars
Unadjusted total                                     422
Less, transmission losses (3%)                        12.7
Less, transmission costs (-0.017 din/kWh)             18.8
Net revenue                               390.5
4.5       The internal economic rate of return (IRR) on the Project is
estimated to be at least 11.2% (see Attachment 4) if benefits are measured
by incremental revenues from power sales attributable to the Project, plus
the net secondary benefits associated with the Project, and if financial
costs are adjusted for taxes, internal transfers, sunk costs of about Din. 17
million and shadow-pricing of unskilled labor. Without the secondary benefits
the return would about one percentage point lower. However, the incremental
revenues understate the benefits, since electricity prices have hitherto
failed to keep pace with the rate of general inflation and it is considered
that they could be significantly increased without reducing demand. Sen-
sitivity tests indicated that, with 20% higher tariffs, the IRR would be
13.3%. If foreign exchange is valued at US$1 = Din. 19.2 (instead of Din.
16), the IRR is 10.3%. Only if the capital costs of the Project are assumed
20% higher does the IRR fall below 10% (to 9.5%).

The Accounting System
1.        Each basic organization uses the chart of accounts and financial
statement reporting forms used by all Yugoslav organizations. They have adopt-
ed the double entry system of accounts and accrue income and expenditure at
the end of the accounting period. The concept of profit (Dohodak) differs in
that it is derived before deduction of expenditure for salaries and wages,
interest on debt, insurance premiums, legal and contractual liabilities. These
expenditures are treated as appropriations of profit. Nevertheless, the form
of accounts used is readily adapted to the form of presentation which is
normally followed by the Bank when appraising public utility projects.
2.        The appropriation of profit is aimed first to meet the organization's
social obligations both legal and contractual before meeting obligations to
the employee for salary, housing, training and recreation. There are social
obligations within the Yugoslav socialist system which require each basic
organization to contribute to the cost of education at schools and universi-
ties; the Federal Fund for Underdeveloped Regions for assistance to the
Republics of Macedonia, Montenegro, Bosnia-Herzegovina and the province of
Kosovo, loans to community funds, other enterprises, and Government institu-
tions.
3.        Salaries are based on social agreements reviewed annually by the
Republican Government, the Chamber of Commerce and the unions. Rates of pay
are set for each category of worker within each industry. The agreements
take into account the need for sufficient funds to maintain the living stand-
ards of the workers and to provide sufficient funds for expanding output.
4.        Assets are not considered to belong to an organization but rather
to be entrusted to a basic organization for their management and control.
Depreciation funds may be used first to meet debt service requirements, then
to finance modernization or replacement of fixed assets, to meet social
obligations, and the remainder may be used to finance new construction.
5.        All cash and payments of accounts are regulated and supervised by
the Social Accounting Service (SAS) who are also responsible for auditing in
Yugoslavia. Each basic organization has its own account (referred to as the
Giro account) at the local bank. All business funds, reserve funds etc. are
maintained in this one account and all payments are verified by the SAS before
checks are sent.



ANNEX 23
Page 2 of 2
6.        Each basic or work organization has its own internal control unit
appointed by the Worker's Council from its members to monitor the implementa-
tion of the decisions of the Council. These units do not exercise internal
control neither do the appointees have to have any special qualifications for
the tasks, nor do they have any particular program of work. Consequently
they could not be construed to perform an internal audit function.
7.        The accounting methods and procedures are not prescribed (with the
exception of the chart of accounts and reporting forms para 1) and thus each
organization is free to develop its own internal systems and apply accounting
procedures as they see fit.  Financial statements are prepared quarterly and
closed off about the 20th of the following month. Annual accounts are closed
off about January 31 and are required to be submitted to the SDK by the end
of February.
8.        Financial planning is developed in the ferm of 5-year plans.  The
present plan expires in 1975 and the proposed 1976-80 plan is now being pre-
pared.
9.        Before a new project can be commenced, the feasibility report and
the financing plan for the project must be approved by the Board of Directors
of the Republican Bank (Privredna Bank of Sarajevo). This implies, of course,
that all sources of funds for financing of the project have been confirmed.
In addition, 5% of the cost of the project must be lodged in a special account
to meet possible cost overruns.

Outline of Terms of Reference for a Management Study
Note
These terms of reference should be considered as preliminary. The
management consultants to be engaged by JUGEL (Loan 836-YU) under their terms
of reference, would also study and make recommendations for the management,
administration and accounting procedures of the 12 borrowers (two of which
are basic organizations of Elektroprivreda). For this reason, appreciable
risks of duplication exist. On the other hand the possibility cannot be
ruled out that Elektroprivreda would engage the same consultants as JUGEL.
The intention of the guidelines below is to indicate which tasks are to be
executed for Elektroprivreda by the management consultants. Future amend-
ment can be expected following discussions with JUGEL and Elektroprivreda
on the final arrangements with respect to the engagement of management con-
sultants.
Terms of Reference
The study shall be executed in 2 stages, the first a `diagnostic"
stage, the second the "implementation' stage.
Stage 1
1.        The present organization, management, administrative, accounting,
planning, and training procedures of Elektroprivreda, and its basic organiza-
tions and Drina, shall be examined with the specific purposes of defining the
requirements for optimum procedures (including management information anu
decision procecures) for introducing concise and modern utility practices,
and for development the organizations to achieve these objectives.
2.        Particular attention should be given to the following points:
(i) Close contact shall be maintained with JUGLL (of whiich
Elektroprivreda is a mem.lber) and its management consultants
to be employed or already employed, in order to reach con-
sensus on recommendations applicable to the members of
JUGEL, and to avoid duplication.
(ii) Immediate consideration should be given to the adminiistra-
tion and accounting procedures and Project information for
the Buk Bijela hiydro Power Project, for which financing by
the International Bank for Reconstruction and Development
(IBRD) has been requested, in order to meet the usual re-
quirements for adequate and prompt recording of the progress



ANNEX 24
Page 2 of 3
of the Project, including its cost, and to identify con-
tinuously the goods and services financed by the proposed
IBRD loan.
(iii) The preparation of a set of meaningful operational statisti-
cal data and monitoring indicators, as recommended by IBRD,
but not necessarily limited to data and indicators proposed
by IBRD.
(iv) Within 6 months after initiating the overall assignment, the
training needs of Elektroprivreda and a:ll its basic organiza-
tions should be examined and recommendations made for any
identified needs, including an appropriate program. This
program should include, on the basis of 5-year manpower
projections, at least the following:
-    specific objectives of the program;
-    fields of training required for each level and
category of staff, with estimated numbers of
trainees in each;
-    methods to be used, including facilities and locations;
-    estimated cost of personnel and facilities,
local and foreign (if any); and
-    a time schedule for implementation, by phases
or segments.
Training experts acceptable to IBRD shall be made available
for this part of the assignment. A special report shall be
submitted covering the training program.
(v) Training (including seminars and lectures to be provided by
the consultants) for administrative purposes shall not await
Phase 2 of the assignment, but start at the earliest date
deemed appropriate, and to the extent considered necessary,
in consultation with Elektroprivreda.
3.        A report shall be prepared on the present conditions within
Elektroprivreda and all basic organizations, stating recommendations for
actions to be taken to achieve the objectives within a period of 1-1/2
years. The report shall include detailed terms of reference for Stage 2
of the study, based on the recommendations, for implementation of the
recommendations.
4.        Elektroprivreda, in consultation with IBRD, will prepare final
terms of reference (including schedule of actions) for the reorganization
and Stage 2 of the study.

Stage 2
5.        Elektroprivreda will institute any needed improvement in its struc-
ture, methods and procedures, in accordance with the terms of reference agreed
upon for Stage 2. The consultants shall study the details of the requirements
for changes in the organization, work methods and procedures, and prepare com-
prehensive reports and/or guidelines for each specific item for which work
rules are essential.! They are to serve as reference guidelines in actual
operations. The consultants shall assist Elektroprivreda in the implementa-
tion of the reorganization, providing on-the-job administrative training and
other training specifically required, and if necessary provide staff for
interim heading of a department while the designated chief is being trained.

Notes and Assuxmptions for Financial Forecasts
1.        The forecasts have been prepared using constant prices assuming
Elektroprivreda and its 17 basic organizations were one consolidated electricity
generation and transmission authority. All transactions between Elektroprivreda
and its basic organizations and between the basic organizations have been ignored.
The forecasts for the basic organization - Dubrovnik - which did not become
associated with Elektroprivreda but was previously a part of the former enterprise
at Trebinje have been excluded from these projections. The assets, liabilities,
income and expenditures for Dubrovnik were deleted from the figures for FY 74 onwards
but are included in the actual accounts for FY 72 and 73. All generation from the
Dubrovnik power station has been assumed to be purchased by Bosnia-Herzegovina with
the exception of 463 GWh retained for use in Croatia from 1975 onwards.
2.        Income Statements
(a)   Electricity Sales - Sales of energy have been estimated by Elektroprivreda
from expected generating capacity installed. Itisassumed exports to other Republics
will be reduced to meet increased requirements within the Republic (except from
plants jointly financed with other Republics). For the purposes of the forecasts
tariff increases of 15%0/a have been assumed an the years1976 through 1978 in addition
to the 30I increase expected to have been introduced in April 1975.  Variations in the
average revenue per kWh sold are due largely to changes in the sales mix arising from
increased sales to new large industrial consumers.
(b)   Other Onerating Revenues comprise interest received, sales of unprocessed
material and scrap. Forecasts assume a 5% increase each year plus escalation using
the official Bosnia-Herzegovina escalation scale referred to in para. 4.03 of the
Appraisal Report.
(c)   Fuel and Materials comprise lignite, oil and maintenance spares.  Forecasts
for fuel have been based on current prices as at September 1974 plus a 40?0 increase
commencing April 1975 plus escalation for 1976 and future years using the Bosnian
scale referred to in (b).
(d)   Salaries and Wages - based on personnel forecasts and current average
salary rates.  An additional 7%' has been added each year to cover merit increases
and promotions plus escalation using the Bosnian scales.
(e)   Other Operating Costs - based on average cost per kWh sold as at the end of
1973. They include insurance, statutory and other contractual obligations to the
Municipality for primary and secondary education, to the Regions for tartiary education
and to the Federation for reconstruction of the regional capital at Banja Luka.



ANNEX 26
Page 2 of 3
(E)   Depreciation - the forecasts assume that minimum rates prescribed by
Federal law will be maintained at an average rate of 3.i% of gross fixed assets
in operation, plus an additional provision of 50% above minimum rates for assets
used in two or more shifts, assumed to apply to 40% of all gross fixed assets
in operation. A new law enacted in 1974; permits increased depreciation on assets
used for one or more shifts per day. Depreciation has been assumed to-commence
from the estimated date of completion of each project.
(g)   Interest - the forecasts include interest on all existing debts except
interest deferred on about 60% of those loans for the years 1974 to 1980 inclusive.
Interest during construction is assumed to be deferred and added to the amount of
the borrowing on all loans except 5S% of foreign borrowing which includes the Bank
loans in accordance with the current practice of the Borrower. After projects are
commissioned it has been assumed that interest will be paid when due.
3.        Balance Sheets
(a)    Fixed Assets have been taken on charge on the estimated completion dates
for construction of each project. Construction costs have been escalated using the
Bosnian scale. Gross fixed assets in operation and the related provisions for
depreciation have been revalued each year and the net adjustment applied to the
business fund (equity) using the following estimated rates of inflation:  9% for
1972, 11% for 1973, and 15, for 1974 plus the Bosnian scale for 1975 to 1980
inclusive.
(b)    Cash comprises cash in hand, Giro account balances, deposits from the
reserve fund, collective consumption fund and the business fund.
(c)    Investments include deposits for investments in fixed assets, loans to
other enterprises, to community funds and the fund for underdeveloped regions.
Forecasts are based on 5% of construction expenditures.
(d)    Accounts Receivable assured to be eaual to 70 days' sales at the end of
1974 and thereafter to ecual 50 days' sales.
(e)    Inventories/Operations increased in proportion to fuel and material
expenses.
(f)    Inventories/Construction - represents 3,0 of annual construction costs.
(g)    Prepayments increased in proportion to increases in annual construction
costs.
(h)    Long-Term Debt - Existing debt as at December 31, 1973 has been increased
each year of the forecasts up to 1980 by the amount of interest deferred. Amortization
and interest payments on all long-term debts are assume.d to comrnence at the end of
guarantee period (except in the case of Bank loans and other foreign loans).
(i)    Current Liabilities - Accounts payable and accruals represent 1 1/, months
of cash operating and constructive expenditures.
