MEMORANDUN AND RECOMNENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT
OF THE IBUD TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS
ON A PROPOSED LOAN TO THE REPUBLIC OF THE PHILIPPINES
FOR A THIRD NUNICIPAL DEVELOPMENT PROJECT
1.          I  submit  for  your  approval  the  following  memorandum  and
recommendation on a proposed loan to the Republic of the Philippines for the
equivalent of US$68 million to help finance a Third Runicipal Development
Project. The loan would be made at the Bank's standard variable interest rate,
with a maturity of 20 years, including five years of grace. About US$34.4
million of the loan would be onlent to cities and municipalities through the
Government's Municipal Development Fund (NDF) for a maximum period of 15 years
including three years of grace at an interest rate based on the prevailing
weighted average interest rate on time deposits of 61-90 days plus a spread
of 2%.
2.        Bjckgrod.  Due to the population shift from rural to urban areas
which has accompanied economic development in the Philippines, th. country's
urban population increased from 18 million (37% of total population) in 1980 to
an estimated 29 million (48%) in 1990. The burden of the population shift is
being borne by cities and municipalities which must provide services,
infrastructure and facilities to meet the needs of their growing economies and
populations. However, owing to the limited financial resources and technical and
managerial weaknesses of the local governments, the supply of services and
facilities has not kept pace with the increased demand, and this has resulted in
congested roads, flooding due to inadequate drainage facilities, unsanitary
putlic markets and slaughterhouses, and uncollected garbage.
3.         Recognizing the increased importance of local governments, the
National Government has acknowledged tht - the provinces, cities and
municipalities should play a larger role in economic and social development and
is proposing to shift more responsibilities to the local levels as part of its
emphasis on decentralization. The revised Local Government Code, signed into law
in October '991, modifies many of the existing laws and regulations governing
national-local government relationships, increases resource transfer to the local
governments, and devolves some of the local functions currently undertaken by
national agencies to the local governments. With this, the role of national
government agencies would shift from direct intervention and control over local
matters to policy guidance and support of local government operations.
4.          Project Objectives.  The proposed project aims at assisting cities
and municipalities in the Philippines to expand and upgrade their infrastructure,
services and facilit'as by: (a) strengthening the National Government's
institutional framework for assisting local governments; (b) strengthening the
local governments' investment planning, financing and implementation capacities;
(c) strengthening the local governments' maintenance capacity; and (d) improving
local fiscal performance.
5.          Lessons Learned from Previous Bank Operations.  Experience under
previous Bank projects has indicated the local governments' interest in loan
financing and the effectiveness of loans in strengthening municipal management.
The Bank has three projects where loan funds are on-lent to cities and
municipalities in the Philippines. Funds under the ongoing projects are fully
committed and requests have been received for additional financing. Repayment



-2-
performance under thesa projects has been satisfactory and the Government has
initiated action to ^aduce arrears. Local executives have shown a wlllingness
to .ndew take politically unpopular reforms to increase revenues if they can show
improvem*nta iL facllities and services to their residents. The first project,
the Regional Cities Development Project (Loan 2257-PH, 1984), ls scheduled to
close in March 1992.
6.          The Bank's municipal development strategy focusses on establishing
an lnstitutional framework within the national government to provide local
governments wlth access to credlt financing and technical assistance.   Key
elements of this instltutional framework are: (a) an inter-agency Project
Steering Committee for coordination and policy guldance; (b) a project office
under the Department of Public Works and Highways (DPWH) to appraise subprojects
and assist project cities and municipallties with preparation of investment
proposals and subprojett implementation; and (c) the MDF within the Department
of Finance (DOF) to administer onlending to local governments. Project funds are
provided to cities and municipalities that qualify for inclusion in the project,
are able to prepare investment proposals, and agree to undertake necessary
fiscal, administrative and managerial improvements. This selection process has
introduced an element of competition for funds among local gover-nrncts and has
allowed the projects to include only those cities and municipalities which have
shown a willignQess and capacity to make necessary policy changes and
improvements.
7.          Rat&o9=lJe for Bank Involvemnnt.  The proposed project forms an
integral part of the Bank's municipal development strategy and would build on the
institutional framework to support such development which was established and
strengthened under earlier projects. Continued Bank involvement at this time
would be important to sustaln investment momentum and continue capacity-bulldlng
both at the national and local government levels. The project is also very
timely assisting the Government to develop and carry out its ongoing
decentralization program.
8.          Project Dscrip$Lon.  The proposed project would include:
(a) 5gJ3ojbets (about US$85.4 midllion) including construction and/or
rehabilitation of basic infrastructure and facilities, procurement of
equipment, and hiring of consultants. The subprojects are divided into:
(i) national components, investments to be funded through the national
budget and implemented by DPWH; and (ii) local components, investments to
be funded and implemented by the cities and municipalities. Bank loan
funds would be provided to the cities and municipalities through the MDF
to finance up to 90% of local component costs. The project office would
appraise each subproject, for approval by the Project Steering Committee
and the Bank.
(b)   Maintenance Prg     (about US$9.8 million) to improve the planning and
implementation of infrastructure maintenance by selected local
governments. Four-year maintenance plans, including annual requirements
for manpower, equipment and materials, would be developed by about ten
pilot cities and municipalities, under the guidance of the project office.
Bank loan funds would be provlded as a grant to the local government
through DPWH to finance 70% of the costs in the first year, 50S in the
second year, and 30S in the third year.



3
(a)                La                        (about US$14.0 million) to improve
real property tax records management and increase real property tax
collection. Bank Loan funds would be provided as a grant to the local
governments through the DOF to finance additional contractual staff,
equipment and supplies required to prepare tax maps, update and streamline
property tax records, and follow-up on collection performance.
Computerization of property tax records would be contingent on the
availab-ility of appropriate software.
(d)   Muncipal          Program (about US$3.1 million) to train local officials
in, among others, project preparation, contract management, construction
supervision, municipal finance and revenue administration, and environment
assessment through the Local Government Academy.
(e)  Te* nicUal  Afsistance  (about  US$1.3  million)  for  (i)  a  study  of
institutional options for further lending to local governments; and (ii)
an environnantal sanitation and solid waste study.
9.          While established a86 a revolving fund, the MDF has functioned
primarily as a mechanism for disbursing funds to local governments, including
funds from donor agencies other than the Bank. To improve the MDF's lending
operations, the following changes are being introduced:
(a) A separate Local Loans Account (LLA) has been established within the MDF
to cover all lending to local governments.
(b)  A MDF/LLA Policy Statement bas been developed to guide MDF lending
operations. A key provision is the shift in MDF's lending terms and
conditions toward prevailing market rates. Given the lack of appropriate
comparators, the reference market rate has been set at the weighted
average interest rate on time deposits of 61-90 days, with a spread of 2%.
This rate was agreed by the Bank and the Government for onlending of Bank
funds under any project to government financial institutions receiving
fixed interest rate loans with maturities of over eight years. Under the
proposed project, the MDF lending rate would be increased from 11% at
present to 14% in 1992 and would be increased by 1.5% each year starting
in 1993 until the rate is equivalent to the market reference rate.
(c)   DOF's Special Project Management Service which handles the MDF would be
restructured by December 1992 along functional lines to provide a clearer
focus on lending operations.
The long-term institutional arrangements for local government loan financing
would be examined through the institutional study included under the technical
assistance component of the proposed project.
10.         Total project costs are estimated at US$113.7 million, of which US$68
million would be financed by the proposed Bank loan. A breakdown of costs and
the financing plan are shown in Schedule A. Amounts and methods of procurement
and disbursement, and the disbursement schedule are shown in Schedule B. A
timetable of key project processing events and the status of the Bank Group
operations in the Philippines are given in Schedules C and D, respectively. The
Staff Appraisal Report, No. 10042-PH dated February 27, 1992, is being
dLstributed separately. A map is also attached.

11.         Project Imolementation.  The project would be implemented over a
seven-year period, 1992-98.  Under the overall coordination of the Project
Steering Committee, project implementation reaponsibilities would be as follows:
(a) DPWH would be responslble (i) through the project office, for preparation,
apptaisal and supervision of subprojects, and (ii) througb its regional offices,
for implementation of the DPIH national components of subprojects; (b) the local
governments would be responsible for preparing subprojects, implementing local
components of subprojects, and RPTA; (c) DOF for managing the MDF and RPTA; and
(4) the Local Government Academy for the Municipal Training Program.
12.         Agemes Reached.  During negotiations, agreements were reached
with the Government on: (a) the reorganization of the Special Project Management
Service by December 31, 1992; (b) Bank review of the appraisal report and on-
lending agreement for each subproject; and (c) by December 31, 1992, preparation
by DO? of an Action Plan for carrying out computerixation under the RPTA
component. Assurances were obtained from the Government on the availability of
counterpart funding and adequate staffing of the project office and the Local
Government Academy.
13.         EnXimental Aneggs.  The project is expected to have a positive
health and environmental impact. The rehabilitation and construction of public
markets with NDF financing would result in clean and hygienic conditions for the
preparation, handling, storage and display of food for human consumption,
particularly fish and meat. Improvements in flood control and drainage systems
would reduce flooding, damage to private property and infrastructure, and
disruption to economic activities and social life. Subloans for landfills with
proper disposal methods would result in reduced air pollution from burning and
possible contamination of groundwater.
14.         Program ObJective Categories. The proposed project would be targeted
at cities and municipalities outside of Metro Manila and its immediate
surrounding provinces where the poverty incidence is about 55-60%, higher than
the 1988 national average of 48%. In determining subprdject scope, preference
would be given to investments with a higher poverty impact. Public market
improvements, which are expected to account for a large part of project subloans,
would benefit the poor families who shop, and the local farmers who sell, at
these markets.    Investment planning,  contract management, property  tax
administration and other local administrative practices would be strengthened
through the proposed project.
15.         Beneflts.   The proposed project would improve the delivery of
services, infrastructure and public facilities at the local level, strengthen
local government management capacity, and improve the National Government's
ability to assist the cities and municipalities to respond to the needs of the
increasing urban population.
16.         Risks. The main project risks relate to the acceptability of moving
toward market rates for municipal lending as envisioned under the project, the
technical and managerial limitations of the local governments, the capability of
the project office to handle a larger number of cities and municipalities than
under previous projects, and the political uncertainty surrounding the upcoming
national elections. However, the proposed on-lending rates are estimated to be
affordable by the cities and financially stronger municipalities, and project
procedures are being streamlined, based on experience to date, to accommodate
larger numbers of local governments.



17.         Fggndatign. I am satisfied that the proposed loan would comply
with the Articles of ABreement of the Bank and recoimend that the Executive
Directors approve it.
