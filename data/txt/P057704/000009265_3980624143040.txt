A: Project Development Objective
1. Project development objective and key performance indicators (see Annex 1):
The project's development objective is to assist the Government in improving the efficiency of Egyptian ports
and ancillary services through regulatory reform, corporatization of sector agencies, and development of a privatization
plan for selected organization units. This is in line with the CAS objectives of promoting private sector development
and growth in exports.
The project is designed to develop regulatory, institutional and financial arrangements in the ports sector which
will enable greater private sector participation and the effective privatization of existing public sector enterprises
operating in the country's ports. The technical assistance to be provided is organized in three phases. Phase I identifies
deficiencies in Egypt's port operations and trade logistics, and develops requirements for introduction of improved
systems, including Electronic Data Interchange Systems to streamline the movement of cargo through Egyptian ports.
Phase II addresses regulatory issues and assists in the issuance of necessary regulations to implement the Government's
policy of commercialized port operations and increased private sector participation in the ports. Phase III develops the
steps necessary for corporatizing port sector entities, assists in their implementation, and develops a phased plan for
privatization of selected units and a redeployment program for surplus labor.
This is proposed as a Learning and Innovation Credit (LIC) because in the initial stages of the reform process, it
is unclear as to what regulatory and institutional arrangements would best serve the purpose of developing a
competitive framework in the ports sector. The LIC would examine a variety of options, and would recommend the
most suitable structure(s) to be implemented for a variety of activities that are on-going or proposed. For instance,
existing multi-purpose ports could be organized as "landlord" ports in which they provide infrastructure and contract
out the provision of services, whereas new specialized port facilities, such as the proposed East Port Said development,
could follow the "Build-Operate-Transfer" (BOT) type of concession arrangement. This LIC would seek to establish
the basic competitive framework under which the Bank and other donors would support future investments in ports,
such as those for East Port Said, Dikheila Port, and other ports proposed for development in the Sinai.
1.1 Key performance indicators
Key indicators for measuring progress towards achieving project objectives would include:
Phase I:     Critical deficiencies in the port's sector identified and implementable solutions endorsed through a
consultative process involving various sector agencies.
Phase II:    Effective competitive framework developed for the sector, and the adequacy of this framework will be
assessed through a consultative process involving various stakeholders from the shipping and ports
industry.
Phase III:   Blueprint for an autonomous, self-financing and competitive port industry established, corporatization
program initiated, and a privatization plan for selected units accepted by concerned agencies.
B: Strategic Context

Port Sector Reform Project                                                                                 3
2. Main sector issues and Government strategy:
2.1    Egypt's ports are critical to the Government's development strategy which, for its high growth scenario, relies
on non-oil merchandise exports growing at between 15 percent and 17 percent per annum through the year 2005. A key
obstacle to such export-led growth is deficiencies in the ports sector which reduce the competitiveness of Egyptian
exports, and most critically, affects the reliability of Egypt's trade logistics. Delays in cargo delivery times and
associated high costs to shippers are often identified by Egyptian exporters as the main areas in which the Government
could improve their prospects for growth. Key issues affecting the port sector include:
* ocean freight rates for Egyptian shippers are significantly higher than for comparable mrovements to other
countries in the area, in some cases the differential is as high as 100 percent
* cargo handling costs at Egyptian ports are also significantly higher - one study found the costs of handling
containiers in Alexandria to be about 25 percent higher than comparable ports in Cyprus, Israel and Turkey'
* container handling productivity in Egyptian ports could be increased by 20 percent to 40 percent, reducing the
need for additional investment
* customs and other clearance procedures (i.e., health, hazardous materials) at Egyptian ports delay cargoes by
5 to 20 days, as conmpared with the I to 2 days needed in more efficient ports, resulting in high storage costs
and damage to cargo
* containerization in Egypt's general cargo trade is estimated to be a low 27 percent of imports and 36 percent
of exports, as compared with international containerization rates of 80 percent of general cargo
Losses to the Egyptian economy resulting from these inefficiencies have been estimated to be on the order of one
billion US dollars annually (Egypt: Port Sector Note, World Bank, January 1998).
2.2    The port system in andl of itself is also seen by the Government as a potential strong contributor to growth. The
strategic location of Egyptian ports, located at the entrances to the Suez Canal, provide many opportunities for
transshipment services to international shipping, particularly for the Eastern Mediterranean region.
2.3    The Government has sought to seize these opportunities and address the deficiencies in the ports sector through
a number of initiatives. Primarily, these initiatives recognize the need to improve efficiency in the sector by
introducing organizational arrangements which provide incentives for efficient operation. To increase competition in
the sector, a number of franchises to private operators for various port services have already been awarded by the
Office of Maritime Transport (OMT) of the Ministry of Transport and Communication (MOT). The Government is
also examining options for introducing greater efficiencies in existing public entities, both port authorities and
operating companies, through restructuring their management and financial relationships, and the Ministry of Public
Enterprise Sector (MOPES) is embarking on a program to privatize the port operating companies. Currently, all port
operating companies are under the control of the MOPES, while the port authorities are under the control of MOT.
3. Sector issues to be addressed by the project and strategic choices:
The proposed project seeks to address those issues in the port sector which now prevent an efficient industry
that is subject to competitive pressures. These issues include: a) existence of public sector monopolies having
privileged access to various resources in the ports; b) lack of financial autonomy and a consequent loss of financial
discipline; c) an antiquated regulatory regime which is not suited to private participation in the provision of port
services; and d) lack of a consensus among key decision makers on the best approach to resolving these regulatory and
institutional problems. In developing an assistance program, it was decided to utilize the Learning and Innovation
approach since this provides for the consideration of a diversity of solutions, and a process of collaborative learning and
problem-solving, so as to improve the likelihood of reaching consensus among the various agencies and interests
involved in the sector.

2. Key policy and institutional reforms supported by the project:
The approach to port sector reform envisaged in the project is outlined below:
(i) The Ministry of Transport through the Office of Maritime Transport will be responsible for the regulation
of Egyptian ports and will seek to foster competition in order to encourage efficiency, lower costs and
improve the competitiveness of Egypt's exports;
(ii) Customs and other cargo inspection procedures will be modernized and carried out on a selective basis in
order to achieve an average one day delay to cargo;
(iii) Individual ports will be owned and administered by autonomous Port Authorities which should be self-
sustaining entities that do not receive support from the general budget, except for payments for specific
public service obligations rendered by the port;
(iv) Port operations will be commercialized, and wherever feasible, be entrusted to the private sector through
operating agreements or concessions, and Port Authorities will seek to ensure that each operating company
faces competitive pressures either from: (a) other ports; (b) internal competition within the port; or (c)
through a process of rebidding concessions after a specified period of time;
(v) Charges for port services should be set at a level designed to: (a) cover operating costs and recover capital
expenditures; and (b) encourage investment in the sector, but not result in a surplus that unnecessarily taxes
exports and imports;
(vi) Ports are free to enter into transshipment activities which do not require subsidies and which produce net
economic benefits to the country through profits generated, a reduction in freight rates, or improved quality
of services; and
(vii) As an interim step to full implementation of this policy, Government will corporatize the ports sector,
including regulatory reforms, restructuring of existing agreements between ports and port operating
companies, reviewing and rationalizing tariff regulations, restructuring the financial management systems
of port authorities, and resolving labor issues affecting efficiency in the ports.
3. Benefits and target population:
The main benefits of the proposed project are: (a) enhanced operational efficiency of Egypt's ports; and (b)
increased competition in the port sector. In turn, competitive pressures would reduce the cost of transporting goods to
and from the country. The beneficiaries of the project are intended to be all sectors of the economy which are
dependent on Egypt's external trade, particularly the exporting sectors.
4. Institutional and implementation arrangements:
Implementation period:
The project would be implemented over an 18 month period.
Executing agency(ies),
At negotiations, agreement will be sought on the establishment of a Port Sector Reform Committee (PSRC),
which is expected to be comprised of members representing the Ministries of Finance, Public Enterprise Sector,
Planning, Trade and Transport. The PSRC would coordinate the inputs from the various Ministries towards achieving
the project objectives. The Ministry of Public Enterprise Sector would assume the role of Executing Agency in order to
enable the contracting process for the appointment of the Technical Assistance Team (the Consultants) to go forward
without delay.

Procurement of Consultant Services
The appointment of the Consultants would be done according to the guidelines specified in the Bank's
publication entitled "Selection and Employment of Consultants by World Bank Borrowers," dated January 1997 and
revised September 1997. IDA staff would assist in developing the Terms of Reference for the Consultants, and in
identifying suitable experts for appointment by PSRC.
Project coordination:
The PSRC is intended to be appointed by the Prime Minister and is expected to have representation from the
Ministries of Finance, Public Enterprise Sector, Planning, Trade and Transport. The PSRC would be headed by a
Chairman appointed by the Prime Minister. A full time Secretariat Unit to support the PSRC would be established
within MOPES. The Secretariat would be responsible for coordinating the work of the Consultants among the various
ministries involved in the project.
Accounting, financial reporting and auditing arrangements:
All project accounts, including any Special Accounts, will be established and maintained according to the
Bank's publication entitled "Financial Accounting Reporting and Auditing Handbook," (FARAH) published in January
1995. During negotiations, it was agreed that the Secretariat Unit would establish, in accordance with IDA guidelines
and as part of the terms-of-reference of the Head of the Secretariat Unit consulting contract, a project accounting and
financial management system within two months of the date of the contract, and subsequently will maintain project
accounts and fulfill all reporting and auditing requirements for the project.
Monitoring and evaluation arrangements:
The Consultant's Team Leader would be responsible for furnishing the Association with detailed quarterly
reports summarizing project operations and utilization of project funds. A staff member located within Resident
Mission Cairo would maintain day to day contact with the Consultants and would keep the Headquarters project team
informed of project status. IDA supervision missions would visit Cairo about twice a year to review critical outputs.
An Early Implementation Review would be undertaken soon after project effectiveness, and in conjunction with project
launch. A draft Implementation Completion Report will be produced by the Consultants prior to the closing of the
credit.
The program envisaged is ambitious but eminently achievable provided the Association remains actively
engaged in the implementation of this credit. The Association's role as a facilitator for the reforns will require an
intensive supervision effort during implementation. We would therefore budget sufficient resources for this activity to
enable the project team to fully respond to the Government's desire to have the Association closely involved in the
reform program.
D: Project Rationale
1. Project alternatives considered and reasons for rejection:
The available alternatives considered were: (i) maintain the status quo; (ii) privatize all operating companies
over the short-term; and (iii) implement the proposed TA. The first alternative is not acceptable since to continue as is
maintains the high cost of exporting and importing goods to the country. The second alternative is not advisable due to
the present arrangements in the sector not being amenable to direct privatization of operating entities since, in most
cases, this would transform public monopolies into private monopolies. The third alternative is the most appropriate in
that it provides for an interim "corporatization" and regulatory reform phase which would eliminate monopoly
arrangements and enable privatization of port sector entities to be undertaken within a comprehensive, competitive
framework.



Port Sector Reforn Project                                                                            7
It is anticipated that as a result of the proposed LIC, a variety of mechanisms which will encourage private
sector participation will emerge and be implemented in Egypt's port sector. These mechanisms are likely to include
green-field BOT's, privatizations, management contracts and in some cases liquidation of existing, poorly performing,
public enterprises which compete with private providers. This LIC would also establish the basic competitive
framework under which the Association and other donors would support future investments such as those proposed for
East Port Said, Dikheila Port, and others.

3. Lessons learned and reflected in the project design:
A couple of important lessons learned from past work involving Technical Assistance and the ports sector in
Egypt have been incorporated into the project, mainly: building safeguards into the project's design to ensure that the
Government is strongly committed to implementing TA; appraising project risks in a realistic manner and designing
project objectives accordingly; and implementing a corporatization strategy for port entities as an interim step to greater
private participation.
4. Indications of borrower commitment and ownership:
Expressions of commitment to the project were given at the highest level, and a letter from the Minister of
Planning and International Cooperation requesting the Association to process the LIC was received on April 2, 1998.



8                                                                                    Port Sector Reforn Project
Following preparation by the Association of an ESW note on the Egyptian port sector, the Prime Minister personally
approved a request for a US$2 million Credit to assist GOE find ways to reform the port sector and increase private
participation in the sector. Such a request is indicative of GOE's desire to have the Association as a partner in the
difficult process of port sector reform. Furthermore, borrowing for follow-up projects in the ports sector has also been
approved by the Prime Minister, which will enable the Association and other donors to develop an effective program of
assistance to the sector after the implementation of this Credit.
5. Value added of IDA support in this project:
The Association has extensive worldwide experience in rehabilitating ports and port operating companies. In
addition, the Association is accustomed to working across ministerial and organizational boundaries, which is critical
now due to the joint responsibilities in the sector between various ministries and agencies, and will serve as an effective
catalyst among the various entities participating in the proposed project. GOE chose to seek the Association's
assistance for this effort, despite having access to various grant resources, in order to obtain the Association's help in
building the consensus needed for effective reform in the ports sector. The Government sees a special role for the
Association as a neutral but informed interlocutor between various agencies such as the Ministry of Transport, the
Ministry of Public Enterprise Sector (which controls the port operating companies and is trying to privatize them), the
Ministry of Finance (which is responsible for Customs and financial management issues), and other agencies involved
in the ports. The proposed LIC therefore envisages a najor learning and consensus building effort, which the project
team has already initiated during the preparation of the Port Sector Note, and which will continue during
implementation through a series of structured collaborative activities among the various agencies. The proposed inter-
ministerial Port Sector Reform Committee will play a key role in this, and the Credit will provide the resource persons
needed to build consensus behind an effective reform program.
E: Summary Project Analysis (Detailed assessments are in the project file, see Annex 8)
1. Economic:
Given the nature of a LIC, i.e. support for small, time-sensitive projects to pilot promising development
initiatives in an environment of experimentation and learning, an economic analysis was not conducted. Also, the
amount of the credit is small ($2 million), with all of the proceeds going to fund Technical Assistance.
However, it is clear that the proposed project produces significant benefits by helping change the status quo in
the sector (alternative 1 in project alternatives above), which is causing large losses to the economy, while at the same
time avoiding the problems of privatizing public monopolies (alternative 2 above), by first restructuring their
relationships with the port authorities to ensure competition prior to their privatization.

4. Institutional:
a. Executing agency(ies)
The Ministry of Public Enterprise Sector will be the executing agency for the project. It is intended that the
PSRC to be established during the project, will coordinate the inputs of other ministries involved in the ports sector. It
is critical to the success of the project that each of the participating ministries, i.e. Transport, Public Enterprise Sector,
Trade, Planning and Finance take an active role in the project and fully participate in the decisions reached by the
PSRC. The Secretariat supported by the Consultants, and IDA staff supervising the project, will need to make sure that
key stakeholders in each of the ministries and other agencies are adequately consulted and kept informed on project
progress in order to ensure there is strong ownership by these institutions in the work being undertaken.
b. Project management
The Secretariat to the PSRC, supported by the Consultants, will be responsible for project management. The
Consultants will produce and submit to the Association, within 30 days of the end of each quarter, quarterly progress
reports and financial accounts for review by IDA staff.
5. Social:
With the increased use of new technologies in the port sector, such as increased containerization, which are
unavoidable if Egypt is to remain competitive in international trade, the port sector will need to develop a well
conceived program to deal with the labor redundancies which are a natural consequence of the improvements in
productivity sought. A key concern will be to avoid social dislocations and unrest, and to deal with the labor issue in a
humane and equitable manner, with an emphasis on redeployment of surplus staff to other productive activities. As
part of the corporatization plan, a comprehensive labor redeployment plan will be developed which utilizes, to the
maximum possible, existing mechanisms such as the Social Fund for Development, to mitigate adverse impacts on
labor. It is also envisaged that USAID may be able to provide local curTency grant financing of labor redundancy
schemes.
6. Environmental assessment: Environmental Category   []A   [] B   [X] C
The project is classified as a "C" for the purposes of OD 4.01 (Environmental Assessment), because it is of a
technical assistance nature.  The project would include a study of environmental liability to identify how
responsibilities for environmental protection would be incorporated into the corporatization and privatization plans in
the sector. As part of the corporatization/privatization program, assurances would be sought that a compliance action
plan would be prepared in accordance with the Egyptian Environmental Protection Law Number 4 of 1994, and that
international treaties and agreements on the environment and international waterways, such as the London Dumping
Convention and the Barcelona Convention (if/when ratified by GOE), would be followed.
7. Participatory approach:
a. Primary beneficiaries and other affected-groups:
The project was discussed in detail with the primary beneficiaries, which are MOPES, MOT and Ministry of
Finance. In developing recommendations for sector reform, the project would seek to build consensus among various
agencies and affected groups. To this end, the project would include funding of workshops to discuss the findings and
recommendations of the consultants and to reach consensus with affected persons. Any voluntary retirement plans
would be discussed and agreed with affected labor groups prior to implementation. Recognizing the difficulties in
achieving a consensus among conflicting interests, the project would include provision of skilled facilitators and
resource persons at the workshops to be conducted under the project.

b. Other key stakeholders:
Shippers organizations, port security agencies, the local governments in port cities, labor organizations, and
shipping lines are among other stakeholders who will have a strong interest in project outcomes. It is intended that
these stakeholders' views will be sought at workshops and seminars to be organized at key points in the implementation
of the project.
F: Sustainability and Risks
1. Sustainability:
Once the project is underway, recommendations have been reviewed and an appropriate strategy identified for
improving the efficiency of the port sector, factors critical to long-term sustainability would be built into subsequent
development initiatives.
2. Critical Risks (reflecting assumptions in the fourth column of Annex 1):

Risk Rating - H (High Risk), S (Substantial Risk), M (Modest Risk), N (Negligible or Low Risk)
3. Possible Controversial Aspects:
Possible controversial issues of the proposed project include:
Corporatization of port operating companies. Corporatization will necessarily involve autonomous, self-
financing and competing port entities. This will diminish central control in areas such as tariff policy, and will also
remove the ports as a source of revenue to the Government since in principle, competitive tariffs should not generate
large surpluses which would be an indirect tax on trade.
Redeployment program for surplus labor. The project will develop a comprehensive plan to deal with the issue
of redundant labor. Such a program for the redeployment of labor will be designed in close coordination with labor
unions and local governments to ensure as much cooperation as possible. Despite these efforts, labor redundancies may
prove difficult, especially in view of the location of most ports in politically sensitive major urban areas of the country.

Proposed Learning and Innovation Credit (LIC)
Egypt: Port Sector Reform
Project Description
Egypt's ports figure prominently in the Government's long-term development strategy for the country, and
the ports sector has been identified as one which could contribute positively to economic growth and job creation.
This positive contribution would come about as a result of correcting a number of deficiencies currently affecting
operations in the sector, and through greater private participation. The project is designed to assist the Government
in its efforts to improve the efficiency of port services by restructuring the organizational and financial systems in
the sector, and by attracting private investment to manage and operate publicly-held enterprises in the sector. The
Technical Assistance (TA) has been designed in three phases, which are described below:
Phase I: Port Sector Diagnostics
Identifying deficiencies in the logistical system of Egypt's exports and imports, in particular those which
deter, or increase the cost of, containerized transport, including customs and other inspections procedures. Specific
outputs include:
a) Review of recent studies on trade logistics and the potential for container transshipment in Egyptian hub-
ports, and a recommended strategy to improve port efficiency and Egypt's competitiveness in container
transshipment.
b) Specifications, bidding documents and organizational arrangements for the implementation of an
Electronic Data Interchange System for Egyptian ports.
Upon completion of Phase I, a workshop to discuss the findings and develop consensus among various
stakeholders on the recommendations will be held under the aegis of the Port Sector Reform Committee.
Specifications and bid documents prepared for the EDI system will also be discussed at a separate pre-bid
conference.
Phase II: Regulatory Reform
This component addresses the regulatory issues surrounding the reorganization of publicly-held port sector
enterprises along commercial lines, with a view to strengthening the role of the private sector in port corporations.
Specifically, the outputs of this component include:
a) Policy framework which accommodates greater private sector participation in the port sector.
b) Regulatory framework including draft new regulations for the port sector to implement the policies
embodied in the new port sector Law Number I of 1998, which provides for private sector participation in
the sector.
At the conclusion of Phase II, the policy/regulatory package will be discussed and approved by the Port
Sector Reform Committee.

Phase m: Corporatization of the Port Sector
This component defines effective organizational structures and financial management systems, and provides
a process for implementing recommendations. Specific outputs include:
a) A proposed structure for a corporatized organization in the sector and assistance in its implementation.
b) Specification of financial management systems for port authorities and port sector enterprises to make
them autonomous and self-financing; and
c) A phased privatization plan and redeployment program for surplus labor.
At the conclusion of the project, the corporatization project, privatization plan and labor redundancy
program will be submitted for comment by the Port Sector Reform Committee to each of the concerned ministries
prior to its submission to the Cabinet for approval.

Annex 7D
Proposed Learning and Innovation Credit
Egypt: Port Sector Reform
Draft Terms of Reference for Consultant's Services
Background
1.    Efficient, high quality port operations are vital to Egypt's long term economic development.
Inefficiencies and constraints in the port sector create obstacles that increase the cost of imports and
decrease the competitiveness of the country's exports. A recent report has estimated that transport charges,
including port costs, can be as high as 40 percent of the CIF price of the exports from Egypt. Reduction of
these charges can have a dramatic impact on the competitiveness of Egypt in the global market. Likewise,
improvements in quality of service, such as availability of door-to-door delivery of containers and reduced
transit time, can also dramatically impact the competitiveness of Egyptian exports and reduce the cost of
imports.
2.    There are a number of indications that efficiency of port operations in Egypt can be improved. A
recent study has found that there is a significant price differential in shipping containers to and from Egypt
vs. comparable locations. The cost of handling containers in Egypt is higher than that of other ports in the
Mediterranean. Productivity for container handling in Egypt is lower than international standards. There is
a significant amount of unproductive paperwork and procedures associated with port clearance.
Containerization has made relatively little penetration in Egypt's overseas trade.
Task #1: Diagnostic Review of the Port Sector
Objective of the Review
3.   Inefficiencies in port operations in Egypt will be identified, the cause of these inefficiencies
determined and actions for correcting these inefficiencies recommended.
Scope of work
4.    The following specific tasks will be performed:
*         Previous studies and available information on port operations and their efficiency
in Egypt will be reviewed. A summary of key findings in previous studies concerning port
deficiencies will be made.
*         The role and activities performed by each public and major private operating
company now providing service in Egypt's ports will be evaluated.
*         A review of freight rates will be made to determine the extent to which
transportation costs to and from Egypt are comparable with costs to other locations in the
Mediterranean. The reasons for any differences in transport costs will be evaluated.
*         The logistics network available to exporters and importers in Egypt will be
evaluated, with particular attention to the availability of door-to-door service. Reasons for



Port Sector Reform Project                                                              29
deficiencies in the logistics network will be identified and recommendations for changes
made, if necessary.
*         The actual cost of handling containers in ports in Egypt will be assessed and
compared to the fees and tariffs charged. The fees and tariffs charged will be compared
with other ports in the Mediterranean with similar traffic volumes and the reasons for any
differences in total cost will be identified.
*         The indlirect cost imposed on shippers due to inefficiencies in port operations will
then be estimated. These indirect costs would include: ship waiting time, berth idle timne
and excessive cargo dwell time, as well as delays due to clearance procedures. Unofficial
charges imposed would also be estimated and the total cost of handling a container through
the port estimated.
*         Recommendations will be provided for reducing costs and if necessary for
restructuring the tariffs.
*         Productivity of ports in Egypt will be compared to that of other ports with similar
traffic volume and operating characteristics. Measures of productivity will include ratio of
berth occupancy, crane utilization, container moves per hour, rate of bulk handling, dwell
time, ship waiting time, etc. The reasons for differences in productivity will be evaluated
and recommendations provided for improving port productivity.
*         Procedures for employing labor, staffing levels and employment conditions in the
ports will be evaluated and the impact on port productivity analyzed. Recommendations for
changes in these will be made, if necessary.
*         The degree to which containerization has penetrated the trade of Egypt will be
established and compared to international and regional averages. Reasons for differences in
percentage of containerization to total general cargo trade volumes will be evaluated.
Recommendations will be made to improve the degree of containerization.
*         Transshipment activity in Egypt will be evaluated to determine the extent to which
current activity benefits the country's economy. Recommendations will be made for
maximizing the lbenefit that can be gained from transshipment hubs in Egypt.
*         Documentation flows and Customs/other clearance procedures will be studied and
the impact on port efficiency identified. Recommendations will be made for changes in
documentation flows and clearance procedures to increase port efficiency.
*         Financial control procedures in the port sector will be reviewed and changes in
these procedures recommended, if necessary.
Time Frame and Deliverable
5.    This diagnostic evaluation will be completed within three months. The deliverable will be
identification of inefficiencies now existing in the Egypt port sector and recommended actions for
correcting these inefficiencies. The results will be presented at a workshop to which key agencies involved
in Egypt's port sector, as well as representatives of shippers, will be invited to comment on the findings of
the diagnostic review. For the workshop, the Consultant shall provide skilled facilitators trained in
consensus building to direct the discussion towards a constructive and definitive outcome.

Task #2: Developing an EDI System for the Ports
Background
6.    Efficient interchange of information among port users is essential to modem port operations. An
initial review of the port sector in Egypt suggests that there is significant room for improvement in
information interchange. In particular, there is a considerable amount of unproductive paperwork and
procedures associated with imports. Quality control checks on imports involve at least seven government
agencies and, according to a recent study, many of the procedural requirements no longer appear necessary.
Customs and other clearance procedures are reported to take 5 to 21 days from day of arrival at the port,
including health and hazardous materials checks.  Utilizing modem  procedures and information
interchange, these clearances and checks could be completed in less than a day.
7.   It is possible that streamlining procedures and introduction of an EDI system could free up a
significant amount of port storage capacity that is now needed due to delays in clearing cargo through ports
in Egypt. For this reason, the government plans to install an EDI system utilizing a BOT contract
arrangement. This new system will be designed to minimize the burden of documentation in Egypt's ports
and speed clearance procedures.
Objective of the review
8.    User requirements will be identified, alternative EDI systems reviewed, specifications and bid
documents for a port sector EDI system prepared, and a plan of action recommended.
Scope of Work
9.    The following specific tasks will be performed:
*         EDI systems utilized in other ports with traffic and operational characteristics
similar to those of ports in Egypt will be evaluated.
*         Interviews will be held with port operating companies, port authorities, shipping
companies, agents, forwarders, terminal operators, government ministries and Customs to
establish user requirements for a port EDI system in Egypt.
*         Based on user input resulting from the interviews, parameters of an EDI system for
ports in Egypt will be established.
*         Alternative organizational arrangements under which the EDI system will be
established so as to allow private sector operation will be evaluated. The organizational
arrangements should take into consideration existing and recommended   future
organizational arrangements (see Task #4).
*         Specifications and bid documents for competitively awarding the EDI system
contract will be prepared and a preliminary financial analysis will be developed for the
BOT contract.
*         A time-phased plan for awarding and installing the EDI system will be developed.

Time Frame and Deliveralble
10.   This review will be completed within two months. The deliverable will be a specification and bid
documentation package for the EDI system, a financial analysis and the plan for awarding and installing the
system.
Task #3: Proposing Reforms to the Regulatory Framework
Background
11.   The present regulatory framework in the Egypt port sector is derived principally from Law No. 12
of 1964, which effectively created state monopolies in all port services. Since then, various developments
have rendered this regulatory framework obsolete. In particular, Law 1 of 1998 permits private sector
participation in ports and regulatory reforms are now needed to recognize this fundamental change in
Government policy in the sector. The Government has sought to cope with these changes through a
number of laws and decrees, many targeted at individual ports or specific services. Among these laws and
decrees are:
*         Law 203 (1991) - Establishing the public sector enterprises.
*         Law 24 (1983) - Setting fees and charges for port services, amended in 1988 and
1990.
*         Decree 161 (1974) - Allowing the private sector to perform some works related
to maritime transport.
*         Decree 98 (1986) - Providing exception from Law 12 to private sector companies
to work in the maritime sector.
*         Decree 34 (1990) -  Providing rules and conditions for private sector agency
service for ships to 400 tons.
*         Decree 40 (1990) - Providing discounts for transshipment containers.
12.   The result has been to create a complex network of laws that do not reflect the requirements of
modem port operation.
Objective of the Review
13.   The regulatory framework under which port operations now take place in Egypt will be reviewed
and revisions to the regulatory structure which reflect the needs of modem port operations and private
sector participation will be recommended.

Scope of work
14.   The following specific tasks will be performed:
*         A policy paper will be prepared outlining the regulatory structure required for a
modem landlord port under private sector operation. This paper is to provide the basis for a
statement of sector policy that would be issued by the government.
*         All existing laws and decrees impacting port operations in Egypt will be reviewed
and a matrix prepared showing the relationships among these laws and decrees.
*         Environmental Protection Law No. 4 (1994) will be reviewed to identify pro-
visions impacting port operations in Egypt.
*         Changes in the existing port regulatory structure needed to enable ports in Egypt to
transition to private sector operation will be identified.
*         Assignment of roles and responsibilities for administering port regulations will be
recommended.
*         Proposed  new  regulations will be  drafted  to  supersede  all existing
regulations/decrees impacting the port sector.
Time Frame and Deliverable
15.   This review will be completed in seven months. The deliverable will be the policy paper, a
statement of changes recommended in the existing port regulatory structure, and the proposed new
regulations to supersede the existing regulatory structure.
Task #4: Developing a Corporatization Strategy for Port Operating Companies:
Background
16.   The pace of privatization in the port sector should reflect the ability to introduce change and a
strategy for restructuring is required that is geared to the ability of the port sector to absorb changes in
organization and operations. Corporatizing port operating companies would provide an interim step toward
full privatization. While short of full privatization, corporatization sets a new pattern for operations in the
port and provides the framework for converting the ports to fully private operation.
17.   Candidates for corporatizing in Egypt include the container handling companies, warehouse
company, inland trucking company and stevedoring companies. Other activities, such as Alexandria Ship
Repair and Shipbuilding and Egyptian Navigation Company, could be either corporatized or sold
immediately to private investors.
18.   Under a corporatization strategy, each of these companies would be established as corporations that
are initially wholly owned by the government. The charter for each corporation would define the operating
activities to be performed and obligations to be assumed. The corporations would be freed from
encumbrances of government policies regarding personnel and other government restrictions not applicable

in the private sector would be eliminated. Equally important, the new corporate enterprises would no
longer have access to general government funds and will need to function as autonomous profit-making
entities.
19.   For companies that presently enjoy some form of monopoly, the corporatization program will seek
to achieve a reasonable degree of competition. Where direct competition is not a viable option, e.g. through
disaggregation into competing units, conditions that allow "competition for the market" will be introduced
by putting in place time-bound contracts which upon their expiration can be bid out for competitive tender.
Objective of the Review
20.   Candidate port enterprises for corporatization will be identified and a strategy for corporatizing each
enterprise will be recommended. In recommending a corporatized structure for the industry, the objection
will be to achieve corporate entities which are autonomous and self-financing, and which operate in a
competitive framework with appropriate safeguards against monopolistic practices.
Scope of work
21.   The following speciific tasks will be performed:
Port operating companies and other port entities considered candidates for
corporatizing will be identified.
*For each candidate, restructuring and other actions required to position the
enterprise for transition to a corporate entity will be identified and evaluated. These actions
will include establishing the rights, assets and liabilities that will convey with the entity.
For each candidate, prepare a compliance action plan to satisfy the requirements of
Environmental Protection Law No. 4, 1994. The plan is to identify responsibilities, roles
and actions to be taken to comply with the law.
*         Draft Articles of Association for each proposed corporate entity and a draft law
required to dissolve the existing legal entity will be prepared.
*         A time-phased plan for implementing the corporatization of each entity will be
prepared.
Arrange a study-tour for key decision-makers (no more than six persons) to visit
countries that have been successfully corporatized/privatized the port sector.
Time Frame and Deliverable
22.   This review will be completed in two months. The deliverable will be legal documentation required
to establish each new entity and a plan for implementing each corporatization.

Task #5: Port Labor Rationalization Study
Background
23.   Substantial reduction in port personnel requirements will take place under a fully competitive,
private sector operation and employee redundancy will undoubtedly be an issue as the port sector is turned
over to the private companies. This redundancy is in part due to the tremendous improvement in
productivity that has resulted from containerization, as handling of containers requires far fewer cargo
handling personnel than traditional breakbulk cargo. The present level of employment in the port sector has
not reflected these productivity gains.
24.   Some form of early retirement scheme and severance package must be considered for redundant
employees to ease the burden of downsizing. A retraining program should also be established to assist
current port personnel in developing skills to transfer to commercial port operating companies or other
industry sectors. This program should include development of management skills that enable port
personnel to establish small companies to bid on port contracts.
Objective of the Review
25.   A restructuring and retraining plan will be developed for redundant port labor resulting from actions
to improve port efficiency.
Specific Tasks to be Completed
26.   The following specific tasks will be performed:
*         An estimate will be developed for workers who will be made redundant as a result
of port sector rationalization.
*         Options for accommodating downsizing of labor force requirements will be
evaluated, including severance arrangements and other actions designed to minimize the
costs of dislocation.
*         A labor redundancy plan will be devised for providing an equitable severance
arrangement and the cost of implementing this plan will be estimated. This plan should
take into account existing labor laws and government programs available to assist displaced
workers.
*         A plan for establishing retraining facilities and other activities to minimize
discomfort of labor downsizing will be prepared.
*         Development of a time-phased plan for implementing the labor rationalization
program.
Time Frame and Deliverable
27.   This review will be completed within two months. The deliverable will be a proposed labor
rationalization plan, including an expenditure budget, to minimize the burden of port rationalization on the
labor force. The plan will be discussed at a workshop attended by representatives of labor groups and

concerned Government agencies. For this workshop the Consultant will provide skilled facilitators trained
in consensus building to direct the discussions towards a constructive and definitive outcome.
Task #6: Developing a Privatization Strategy for the Port Sector
Background
28.   The Government of Egypt has as a matter of policy, decided to maximize the role of the private
sector in delivery of port services. For existing ports, the Government has determined that a landlord port
authority with private competitors performing services offers the greatest potential to produce efficiencies
in port operation. Under this arrangement, the port authority would continue to have landlord responsibility
for the port, but responsibility for operations within the port would be transferred to private contractors who
would perform various services. The port authority would retain responsibility for port administration and
control - and private companies under concession agreements, leases or management contracts would
perform operating activities of the port now performed by state owned companies. For new port
developments, the Government wishes to utilize "Build-Operate-Transfer" concession arrangements, and
now there is a need to develop standard concession terms and necessary regulatory controls.
29.   However, there are difficult issues with which to contend in transitioning to private sector operation.
These issues include: (i) establishing a policy on number of competitors within each activity; (ii) setting
standards for new entrants; (iii) ensuring a private monopoly does not result; (iv) providing a level playing
field for all competitors; (v) adapting the port tariff structure to private sector operation; and (vi)
determining the appropriate mode of contracting for each type of privatization.
30.   A strategy and plan for privatization needs to be developed that addresses these issues and provides
a road map for transition of port operations from publicly owned companies to the private sector.
Objective of the Review
31.   A strategy and plan of action will be developed for transitioning from the corporatized structure to
increasingly private operations in the Egypt port sector.
Scope of work
32.   The following specific tasks will be performed.
*          Entities to be privatized will be identified, a preliminary assessment will be made
of their likely value, and issues relating to the transition of each entity to private sector
operation will be discussed.
*          A policy paper will be prepared addressing how transition issues created by
privatization of each entity will be resolved.
*          A strategy and plan will be developed for each activity to be privatized that
addresses (i) the mode of privatization to be utilized; (ii) actions required to implement the
privatization; (iii) pre-qualification criteria for investors; (iv) timing of actions needed to
complete the transactions; and (v) responsibilities for implementing the strategy and
carrying out the transactions.

*         For each candidate, responsibilities, roles and actions to be taken to comply with
Environmental Protection Law No. 4, 1994 will be identified.
Time Frame and Deliverable
33.   This review will be completed within two months. The deliverable will be a strategy and plan for
privatizing the port sector in Egypt.
Final Relport
34.   The Consultant will organize a seminar for key decision-makers to present a concluding overview of
the outcomes achieved and future plans developed as a result of the Port Sector Reform Project. A final
report reflecting the comments received at the seminar will be prepared and submitted to PSRC (20 copies)
and to the IDA (5 copies).
Estimated Man-Months.
35.   The total estimated man-months for the job is estimated at 50 expatriates and 50 local experts. The
man-months estimated is indicative only and the consultant may reduce it or increase it according to his
proposed approach to addressing the issues. The total duration of the study is estimated at 18 months
according to the attached schedule. The consultant would be required to include one car and sufficient
computers and office equipment for the Secretariat.
Evaluation of Proposals
36.   The proposals will be evaluated according to the following criteria:
* Experience in similar studies      20
* Proposed Approach                  30
* Team Experience                    50
