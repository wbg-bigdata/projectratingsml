INTERNATICNAL DEVELOPMENT ASSOCIATION
RIPORT AND RECOMMENDATION OF TEE PRESIDENT
TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS
ON A PROPOSED DEVELOPMENT CREDIT
TO THE EMPIRE OF ETBIOPIA
FOR A COFFEE PROCESSING PROJECT
1.        I submit the following report and recommendation on a proposed
development credit to the Empire of Ethiopia for the equivalent of U$ 6.3
million on standard IDA terms to help finance a coffee processing project.
PART I - THE ECONCMY
2.        A report "Current Position and Prospects of the Ethiopian
Econonny" (AE-21) was circulated on November 18, 1971. A country Data
Sheet is attached as Annex II.
3.        Virtually isolated from modern science and technology until
the middle of the twentieth century, Ethiopia is one of the least
developed of all developing countries. The per capita income is $64
a year and some 85% of the population of 25 million are peasant farmers.
Agriculture accounts for about 90% of employment, 58% of GDP, and almost
all exports. Manufacture contributes only around 5% of GDP.
4.        During the last two decades the government has made notable
efforts to accelerate the pace of development. Ethiopia is now in the
middle of its Third Five-Year Plan (TFYP). The first two plans gave
priority to the development of infrastructure such as roads, telecommuni-
cations and power, and the establishment of manufacturing industries
(mainly government-financed) based on import substitution. The third plan
emphasizes the development of agriculture and of activities such as training
and feeder road building which directly support agricultural development.
However, progress has been slow. Institutions are changing only gradually,
and the slow pace of change, such as in the land tenure system, has
inhibited rapid growth. At the same time Ethiopia has had a relatively
low and somewhat intermittent capital inflow. Coffee is Ethiopia's
principal source of foreign exchange but the world demand for coffee
increases only slowly. Moreover, export prices are changeable, leading
to large swings in export income. With respect to aid, Ethiopia, unlike
many other African countries which were formerly dependent, has had no
traditional source of technical and financial help.
5.        Over the past decade, per capita GDP grew at about 2%. Growth
might have been lower but for a 16p' annual rate of growth of the manufac-
turing sector based on import substitution. The economy has been partic-
ularly sluggish during the last two to three years. The prices of domestic
food grains have risen sharply owing to a shortage of supplies. Exports
did not grow and, at the end of 1970, external reserves were at an all-time



- 2 -
year-end low of less than four months'imports. Partly because of an
economic recession in the last two years and partly because the opportu-
nities for further import substitution had diminished, the growth of
manufactures was less rapid than hitherto and the inflow of private
capital declined. As a result of these developments the pace of invest-
ment and growth was below the planned targets. Also, while total population
grew at 2.5% a year, the urban population rose at about 7% a year and
the problem of urban unemployment and the need for systematic urban
planning became evident.
6.        It was against this background that the Bank and the Ethiopian
Government agreed to the formation of a Consultative Group for Ethiopia.
A principal purpose of the Group is to provide a forum for a dialogue
between Ethiopians and aid donors, with the hope that deeper understanding
on both sides of the development problems facing Ethiopia might lead to
some increase in the volume and effectiveness of aid. In preparation for
the unaugural meeting of the Group in May 1971, the Ethiopian Government
reviewed the progress of the Third Five-Year Plan. In general the govern-
ment reaffirmed the main strategy and policies of the Plan, which were
to give priority to the development of agriculture and allied activities.
However, within the overall strategy there was some shift in emphasis
towards the development of peasant agriculture in order to realize the
Plan's four objectives of broadening the monetization of the economy,
expanding employment in the rural areas, achieving a more favorable income
distribution, and increasing supplies of domestic food crops. The revised
strategy also recognized the need to increase and diversify exports and
to diversify the overall economy through the development of tourism,
manufacturing, and mining. In the expectation of an increase in coffee
prices based on the incipient price recovery in 1969, new investment and
growth targets were fixed and the TFYP period was extended for a sixth
year to 1973/74. Unfortunately coffee prices are now not expected to
rise, and the new investment and growth targets for the remainder of the
extended TFYP may well not be realized.
7.        Turning to the longer-term future, it is clear that agriculture
will remain the dominant economic activity and that although there is some
scope for increased production for the domestic market, the main push will
have to come from increasing exports. Possibilities include livestock,
fresh fruit and vegetables, pulses, and oil seeds. Nanufacturing is con-
strained by the small size of the domestic market, and the present lack
of competitive advantage in manufacturing for export. Although tourism
has been growing at about 14% a year it is on a small scale and Ethiopia's
tourist attractions are not such as are likely to attract mass tourism in
the near future. There are large reserves of potash but the world market
is at present well supplied, so that there appears to be little hope of
developing them, possibly until the 1980s.
8.        The Bank is taking a number of steps to support the Government's
development strategy, which appears to be sound. The proposed credit for
a coffee processing project will raise export earnings and increase the



- 3 -
value added from coffee. A mission recently visited Ethiopia to make
a comprehensive study of the whole agricultural sector. The Ethiopian
Government, with IDA assistance, has undertaken a review of the education
sector to enable it to design policies and curricula which will produce
the trained manpower needed for Ethiopia's development. The Bank is
providing technical assistance to rationalize the structure of tariff
protection and the measures to encourage investment, so as to promote
more efficient manufacturing development. The Bank is also executing
agency for a UNDP-financed study of internal air transport with special
regard for tourism development, and for a project to provide a team of
experts to help the Government in improving its planning.
9.        The Agricultural Sector Mission has concluded that the problem
of Ethiopian agriculture is one of supply, marketing and processing rather
than demand and that livestock has the best export growth potential. The
main factors constraining growth are the land tenure system, which includes
communal tenure, occupation by nomadic pastoralists, and "tenancy at will"
combined with share cropping, and the lack of research, extension, trained
manpower, credit, marketing and transport. The government is aware of
these constraints and has taken some steps to deal with them; it has
established the Agricultural and Industrial Development Bank (AIDB) and
has submitted legislation for tenancy reform to Parliament. Two main
difficulties confront the government - the shortage of resources and
institutional inflexibility.
10.       Ethiopia's capacity to plan and execute projects is improving,
although technical assistance for these purposes will be required for
some time. There is need for a more active fiscal and monetary policy
to increase domestic savings, but in view of Ethiopia's poverty substantial
external assistance will be required to finance an investment program
commensurate with Ethiopia's needs. It is projected that the Ethiopian
Government will be able to finance about 48% of public investment from
recurrent budget surpluses and domestic borrowing over the next three
years and will have to look to external assistance for the remainder.
Since many individual projects will not be able to attract foreign
assistance it follows that if external assistance is to make an adequate
overall contribution, significantly more than half the cost of other
projects will have to be financed by foreign capital. This often implies
external financing of part of the local expenditures as in the case of
the proposed project. Export prospects are unfavorable; even with the
proposed project to process coffee for export, the growth of coffee exports
earnings is unlikely to exceed 3% a year. Other major exports are likely
to take a long time to develop. Hence Ethiopia will need foreign assistance
for many years. Although Ethiopia's debt service ratio is only 11.4%,
considering that the prospects for the growth and diversification of exports
are limited, there is a need for careful management of external capital
flows and a substantial portion of capital provided in the future should be
on concessionary terms.

PART II - BANK GROUP LENDING TO ETHIOPIA
11.      Since 1950 when Ethiopia was the recipient of the Bank's first
loan in Africa, Ethiopia has had eleven Bank loans totalling US$97.8 million
and seven IDA credits amounting to US$48.9 million. Four loans are fully
repaid and four others are fully disbursed. A summary statement of Bank
loans, IDA credits and IFU'investments in Ethiopia at November 30, 1971
is attached as Annex I.
12.      Until 1969, the lending program concentrated primarily on building
Ethiopia's infrastructure of roads, powzer, and telecommunications.  In
addition there were two loans to the Development Bank of Ethiopia and one
credit for education. Aside from some small amounts for agriculture pro-
vided under the loans to the Development Bank of Ethiopia, our first lending
for agriculture in Ethiopia was the credit for the Wolamo project in 1969.
Since that time we have made two additional credits for agricultural pro-
jects (Humera in 1970 and Addis Ababa Dairy in 1971) and one for education.
This shift in emphasis in our lending program reflects both the success of
our earlier lending in meeting the most crucial infrastructural needs, and
the increased opportunity for agricultural lending brought about in part
by improved sectoral knowledge and research findings, and the heavier
emphasis on agriculture in the Government's own priorities. While the need
to finance infrastructure will continue, it is expected that the emphasis
of our future lending will be placed on agriculture and supporting activities
in manpower development, marketing, credit, and transportation.
13.      Other lending proposals for Ethiopia which may be ready for
presentation to the Executive Directors during FY1972 are a water supply
and sewerage project in the city of Addis Ababa, a development finance
company project, a road development project, and a second livestock project.
The proposed road development project will have its economic justification
based largely on the potential for increased agricultural output of the
regions to be served by the roads. The proposed development finance com-
pany project will also contain a large component for agricultural credit.
14.      There are no particular disbursement problems except for the
1963 Credit (35-ET) and the 1968 combined Loan (523-ET) and Credit (111-ET)
for highways. The remaining $700,000 of the 1963 Credit cannot be fully
disbursed until the Government and contractors have concluded arbitration
proceedings arising out of claims concerning completed road construction.
The arbitration proceedings appear to be progressing in an orderly manner.
The delay in disbursement of the 1968 Loan and Credit resulted from slow
progress in the preparation of acceptable tender documents and contractor
prequalification. The small number of responses to the first tender re-
quired a second tender with some changed conditions. Contracts were
finally signed in July and August 1969 and work is now proceeding normally.



- 5 -
15.      The International Finance Corporation has committed
US$3.1 million to the Cotton Company of Ethiopia, US$1.0 million to the
Ethiopian Pulp and Paper Company and US$9.0 million to the HVA-Netahara
sugar-growing and milling project. After deducting amounts taken up by
sub-subscribers, sales from portfolio and principal repayments, the IFC
now holds US$10.3 million for its own account.
PART III - THE PROJECT
16.      As noted above, a major goal of Ethiopia's development strategy
must be to expand export earnings to alleviate what threatens to be a
severe long-term balance-of-payments problem. This requires an effort
to develop new exports, but coffee,which currently provides about 60% of
export earnings, should not be ignored. While the International Coffee
Agreement's export quotas and the slow growth of world coffee demand pre-
vent any significant increase in the quantity of coffee exported, there
remains the opportunity of increasing export earnings by improving export
quality. The proposed project is designed to increase export earnings
through switching some exports from coffee processed by traditional sun-
drying methods into higher priced washed coffee.
17.      Ethiopia is probably the original source of Arabica coffee.
Estimates of production today 'vary from some 160,000 to 200,000 tons per
annum (about 5% of world production). Ecports are about 80,000
tons per annum (about 2% of world trade). About 60% of production is
harvested from wild coffee growing in western Ethiopia, with an additional
30-35% coming from small plots around dwellings, principally in Sidamo
Province, and the remainder from plantations in Kaffa Province. While
the intrinsic quality of Ethiopian coffee is good, the low but slowly
improving standards of harvesting and subsequent handling result in
low prices for much of it.
18.      A coffee cherry generally contains 2 coffee beans, each covered
by a parchment skin, and surrounded by a layer of pulp beneath the outer
cherry skin. About 95% of Ethiopia's coffee is processed by drying the
coffee cherry in the sun, following which the outer and parchment skins
are removed in one milling process. Washed coffee is produced by
mechanically separating the outer skin and much of the pulp from ripe
coffee beans by means of a simple machine (pulper) with the aid of running
water. After the remaining mucilage is broken down by fermentation and
washed off, the resulting bean is dried, following which the parchment
skin is removed by milling. The washing process provides a means for
controlling quality since unsuitable cherry can be more easily identified
and rejected when the cherry is ripe than after it has been sun dried.
Washed coffee production requires adequate water supply, the availability
of feeder roads (since it is necessary to bring the ripe coffee beans to
the washing station quickly before they spoil), and suitable varieties of
coffee.

19.       A report entitled, "Appraisal of a Coffee Processing Project,
Ethiopia" (PA-ll9) is being distributed separately. The proposed pro-
ject involves the construction of about 100 new coffee washing stations
(each of 100 tons seasonal capacity), improvements to about 100 existing
stations, construction of about 400 km of dry weather access roads, and
technical services for the preparation of follow-up projects, for research
into improved coffee grading and forest coffee management, and for a
survey of the Ethiopian coffee economy. The project would be located in
selected areas of the provinces of Sidamo and Kaffa, where the coffee has
been identified as particularly suitable for the washing process and where
water supply is ample during the processing season. A Credit and Project
Summary is at Annex III.
20.       The proposed project is expected to increase Ethiopia's foreign
exchange earnings by about US$2.6 million a year at full development in
1977-78 through converting some 11,000 metric tons of coffee exports per
year from unwashed to washed. In addition, the cash incomes of some
33,000 farm families would be increased by approximately 10-15% compared
to the incomes they would have earned without the project, and additional
employment would be provided for about 200 permanent and 1,000 seasonal
workers. The financial and economic results of the project do not depend
significantly on the absolute level of coffee prices, but are largely
dependent upon, and are quite sensitive to, the differential in prices
between Ethiopian washed and unwashed coffees. A simplified form of risk
analysis has therefore been carried out, based on probabilities assigned
to various differentials between washed and unwashed coffee prices. This
analysis, which was completed before recent exchange rate adjustments,
indicated that the mean economic rates of return of the proposed invest-
ments in washing stations in various locations would be between 17% and
21%, depending on the degree of road construction needed. The mean finan-
cial rate of return on investments made by private and cooperative owners
of washing stations was calculated to be about 17%. It is too early to
assess the effect of the proposed devaluation of the US dollar on coffee
prices. If the differential between washed and unwashed coffee prices
declined by the full amount of the dollar devaluation, the mean rates of
return would decline by 2-3%. However, since the main market for
Ethiopian unwashed coffee is the US while the main market for Ethiopian
washed coffee is Germany, it is not unlikely that the price differential
between washed and unwashed coffee and the resulting rates of return
will increase.
21.      While by 1977/78 Ethiopia's washed coffee production is likely
to grow from its present level of about 10,000 tons to some 27,000 tons
(inclusive of the 11,000 ton estimated output of the proposed project),
this increase would be counter-balanced by an equal reduction in the
production of unwashed coffee and thus would have no effect on Ethiopia's
obligations under the International Coffee Agreement. However, it is
also estimated that the road network to be constructed in the project
area and the improved marketing arrangements, might give rise to some new
additional production in the area - tentatively estimated at about 1,000
tons per annum by 1980/81 representing about 1% of the current Ethiopian



- 7 -
share of exports to quota markets. It would be unlikely to have any
measurable effect on Ethiopia's ability to comply with its obligations
under the International Coffee Agreement. The projected increase in
the proportion of washed coffee in Ethiopian output would be unlikely
to affect significantly the prevailing relationship between world market
prices for washed and unwashed coffees, since the resulting increase
in world trade in washed coffee would be less than 1% and demand for
washed coffee is increasing.
22.       The proposed project was identified in October 1969 by staff
of our Permanent Mission in Eastern Africa, who subsequently assisted
the Ethiopian National Coffee Board (NCB) in its preparation. Field
appraisal took place in September/October 1970. Negotiations began
in liashington on April 5, 1971. The Borrower was represented by
Ato Asnake Getachew, Executive Secretary, NCB; Ato Yelma Yemane Berehan,
Head of Production Department, NCB; Ato Teferra Haile Selassie, Assistant
Minister, Cooperative Department, Ministry of National Community Develop-
ment and Social Affairs; Ato Addis Anteneh, Head of the Agriculture
Department, Agricultural and Industrial Development Bank (AIDB);
Ato Zerobruke, Senior Attorney, AIDB; and Ato Asfaw Damte, Financial and
Economic Attache at the Ethiopian Embassy in lWashington. The proposed
organization and administration of the project were discussed during
these negotiations, but the delegation was not able to reach a decision
on this issue without further consideration in Addis Ababa. The Govern-
ment informed us of their decision in June 1971 and in late September
submitted for our agreement the draft legal instruments for establishing
the project organization. Negotiations were finally completed in December.
23.      The total cost of the project is estimated at US$10.3 million.
The proposed IDA credit of US$6.3 million would finance 61% of the total
cost; the Government and the AIDB would provide US$3.5 million; and coffee
processors would contribute the remaining US$0.5 million. To help meet
the target for starting construction of the roads and coffee washing
stations under the project (October 1972, immediately after the wet
season), the proposed project includes a provision for US$100,000 of
retroactive financing of expenditure for preparatory work - staff adver-
tisements, preparation of bid documents, and preliminary surveys -
incurred before the credit is signed. The foreign exchange component of
the project is estimated at US$40. million or 39% of the total. The
proposed credit would cover this amount plus US$2.3 million of local
expenditure. The reasons for financing local expenditure are discussed
in paragraph 10 above.
24.      The project would be administered principally by a Project
Implementation Unit (PIU), to be established for that purpose as an
operationally independent unit of the National Coffee Board. The
Agricultural and Industrial Development Bank would act as the credit
channel. Of the $6.3 million credit, (a) $2.6 million for construction
or improvement of washing stations would be relent to NCB (for use by PIU)
or to private and cooperative washing station owners through the Agri-
cultural and Industrial Development Bank acting as agent of the Government,



- 8 -
(b) $2.8 million for road construction, technical services, and prepara-
tion of follow-up projects would be passed on to NCB by the Government
as a grant, (c) $0.2 million for coffee research would be passed on to
the Institute of Agricultural Research (IAR) by the Government as a grant,
and (d) $0.7 million would be allocated for contingencies.
25.      PIU would be responsible for the construction of some 70 of the
100 proposed new washing stations which would be built along project roads
in the Sidamo Province, and which would be operated by PIU until viable
cooperatives of coffee farmers could be established to take them over.
The remaining 30 new washing stations would be owned by existing coopera-
tives and estates in Kaffa Province. The 100 stations to be improved
are owned by merchants in Sidamo Province. PIU would also, (i) stimulate
the development of cooperative societies of coffee farmers, (ii) provide
technical services for the other washing station owners financed under
the project, (iii) be responsible for the road construction program, and
(iv) prepare follow-up projects. All sub-loans made under the project
by AIDB to washing station owners other than PIU would be appraised
technically by PIU staff who would also supervise construction of washing
stations and their initial operation. NCB itself would be responsible
for the survey of the Ethiopian coffee economy, with the assistance of
the International Coffee Organization and FAO.
26.      The NCB was established as an autonomous agency of the Government
in 1957 with particular responsibility for improving the quality of export
coffee. In 1962, it assumed responsibility for ensuring that Ethiopia's
obligations under the International Coffee Agreement wTere fulfilled. NCB
has all normal corporate powers including the power to own assets, borrow
money, employ staff, carry out research, operate and control markets and
establish a coffee exchange in Addis Ababa. However, to enable NCB's PIU
to fulfill its obligations under the project, Parliament will have to
extend the powers of NCB, particularly by giving it inter alia the power
to buy coffee from farmers and cooperatives and to process and market
such coffee, to lend or provide credit to farmers and cooperatives, to
build and maintain roads and to prepare future agricultural projects
outside the coffee sector. These additional powers are to be provided
to NCB (but limited to use in the execution of the project and the opera-
tion of project facilities) in the Proclamation ratifying the proposed
Credit Agreement. Thereafter an NCB Resolution would establish PIU.
The enactment of this Proclamation and the adoption of the NCB Resolution
are pre-conditions to the signing of the Project Agreement, which will
as a consequence be signed some time after the Credit Agreement itself
is signed and ratified. Under this procedure Parliament will be able
to act at one and the same time both to ratify the Credit Agreement and
provide NCB with the additional powers specifically needed for, and
limited to, this project.



-9-
27.      AIDB is a Government-owned development Bank which was created
in August 1970 as a result of the amalgamation of the former Ethiopian
Investment Corporation and the Development Bank of Ethiopia. This
amalgamation followed the recommendations of a Financial Intermediaries
Reorganization Commission which received technical assistance from the
World Bank. A Bank Group project to finance AIDB's medium- and long-term
investment program in the agricultural and industrial sectors is currently
under consideration. It has been arranged that funds from the coffee
processing credit would be kept separate from AIDB's own accounts and
that AIDB would act as agent of the Government in making sub-loans to NCB
and to other washing station owners. The Government would open a Project
Account with the National Bank of Ethiopia to be operated by AIDB, from
which account disbursements on sub-loans would be withdrawn. Sub-loans
would carry interest at rates between 9½% and 12%. Loans to private and
cooperative washing station owners for complete washing station construction
would be for an average period of 10 years including one year of grace,
with loans for washing station improvement averaging three years including
one year of grace. Lending to NCB would be for fifteen years including
four years of grace. AIDB would deposit repayments of principal and
interest at 71M% into the Project Account, retaining the remaining interest
margin as compensation for work performed and risk assumed. AIDB would
bear the credit risk on sub-loans to private and cooperative washing
station owners. AIDB would also arrange for or provide the short-term
credit required for washing station op eation.
28.      Contracts estimated to cost over US$20,000 for road construction
machinery and equipment (us$0.8 million CIF value, including contingencies),
machinery and equipment for coffee washing stations (US$1.3 million) and
personnel-carrying vehicles for PIU (US$0.1 million) would be let following
international competitive bidding procedures organized by PIU. PIU itself
would construct the roads in Sidamo Province, in the absence of suitable
local contractors, using the imported road construction machinery and
equipment. Other contracts for machinery, equipment and vehicles, and
all contracts for the construction of PIU washing stations, for roads
in Kaffa and for bridges and river crossings in Sidamo would be let
following competitive bidding based on local advertising, since these
contracts would be too small to interest foreign bidders. Construction
of washing stations to be owned by the private sector or by existing
cooperatives would normally be organized by the washing station owners
through local competitive bidding, but some sub-borrowers may choose,
with the prior approval of AIDB, to construct their washing stations
themselves.
PART IV - LEGAL INSTRUMENTS AND AUTHORITY
29.      The draft Development Credit Agreement between the Empire of
Ethiopia and the Association, the draft Project Agreement between the
Association, AIDB, IAR and NCB, the Recommendation of the Committee



- 10 -
provided for under Article V, Section 1(d) of the Articles of Agreement,
and the text of a draft Resolution approving the proposed Development
Credit are being distributed to the Executive Directors separately.
30.      Aside from the special arrangements described in paragraph 26
above, the draft Agreements combine features which conform generally
to the pattern of recent agreements for agricultural credit projects
and for projects providing for agricultural processing facilities to
be operated by Government-owned entities. The relending of the proceeds
of the credit to NOB (for use by PIU) and to the private sector and
cooperatives through AIDB will be governed by a project financing agree-
ment, between the Empire of Ethiopia and AIDB; a subsidiary loan agreement,
between AIDB and NCB; and sub-loan agreements between AIDB and the private
sector or cooperatives. The arrangements for PIU's operation of washing
stations and for the gradual handing over of control and ownership of
washing stations to cooperatives as they develop will be governed by
an NCB Resolution. The adoption of this resolution and the execution of
these agreements (other than the sub-loan agreements with private individ-
uals or cooperatives) would be a condition of effectiveness. The execution
of the proposed Project Agreement between the Association and AIDB, NCB,
and IAR is a condition of effectiveness of the Development Credit Agreement
and will take place as soon as NCB has been given the necessary powers by
a Proclamation. Satisfactory drafts have been provided of the Proclamation
to be presented to Parliament combining the ratification of the Development
Credit Agreement and the granting to NCB of the additional powers enabling
it to carry out its obligations under the Project Agreement, and of the
NCB Resolution establishing PIU.
31.      I am satisfied that the proposed credit would comply with the
Articles of Agreement of the Association.
PART V - REOMMiENDATION
32.      I recommend that the Executive Directors approve the proposed
credit.
