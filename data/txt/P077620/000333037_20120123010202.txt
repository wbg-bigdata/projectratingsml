F. Results Framework Analysis

Project Development Objectives (from Project Appraisal Document)
The Project Development Objective of the Financial Management Capacity Building Project
(FMCBP) was to provide technical assistance and training programs to support the development
of institutional capacity to assist in the successful implementation of the government’s


                                                      ii
macroeconomic structural reform program. The project would support both the achievement of
the reform objectives and the long-term development of institutional capacity through technical
assistance, training programs and system development in selected agencies in the Lao PDR. The
project also aimed to provide a medium-term framework for Bank’s assistance. The FMCBP
was also expected to provide a comprehensive framework for consolidating and providing a
strategic focus in capacity-building activities in the country.

Revised Project Development Objectives (as approved by original approving authority)
The restructured and scaled-up project was aligned to the overall government-approved reform
programs with the bulk of its resources allocated to public finance management reforms. The
PDO was accordingly recalibrated to focus on improving the government’s budget preparation,
execution, reporting and auditing systems, strengthening the monitoring of state-owned
commercial bank operations, and improving financial management of selected state-owned
enterprises. No changes were made to the general design and implementation modalities.

1. Project Context, Development Objectives [or Global Environment Objectives] and
Design (this section is descriptive, taken from other documents, e.g., PAD/ISR, not evaluative)

1.1    Context at Appraisal (brief summary of country and sector background, rationale for
Bank assistance)

In the late 1990s, the Lao People’s Democratic Republic (Lao PDR) suffered from the adverse economic
effects of the Asian financial crisis. These were aggravated by a weakening effort in domestic reform and
macroeconomic management. GDP growth was slowing; the Kip fell in value, and inflation was triple
digit during this period. The authorities’ preliminary responses were partial and ad hoc due to a lack of
political consensus for a comprehensive program to halt the country’s economic deterioration.

In 2000, the government renewed its effort to restore economic stability and reduce poverty through its
five-year plan and the Interim Poverty Reduction Strategy Paper (I-PRSP).1 It embarked on a program of
structural reforms aiming to strengthen macroeconomic stability, reduce the drain on public resources by
the state-owned banking and enterprise sectors, attract private investment, and increase budget and
financial transparency. The program focused on the following areas: financial sector, public sector
management, and state-owned enterprise (SOE) sector. In the financial sector, the government sought to
improve the efficiency of financial intermediation, foster confidence in the sector and help strengthen
macroeconomic stability. To increase the efficiency of public expenditure management, the government
aimed to implement specific policy measures for transparent and efficient public expenditure budgeting
and execution and strengthening of revenue-generation measures. The government’s commitment to
market-based reforms and global integration required a strengthening of the enterprise sector, both state-
owned and private after previous extensive structural changes, especially in the SOE sector.

The implementation of this program required significant human and institutional capacity development, a
prerequisite for a successful and sustainable reform program. As the country faced inadequate human
resources and constraints in the public sector, especially in the areas of economic and financial sector
management, the strategy of the Lao authorities was to assign priority to sustained human resource
development and capacity building activities to assure effective management of its reform program.

The Financial Management Capacity Building Project was the Bank’s response to these needs in the Lao
PDR. The Bank’s involvement in this project was consistent with its overall assistance program as
outlined in the Country Assistance Strategy (CAS). The CAS called for better management of public
resources to support development and strengthening of the government’s institutional capacity in order to
effectively assist the implementation of its macroeconomic structural reform program as outlined in its
five-year plan and the PRSP.

1.2   Original Project Development Objectives (PDO) [or Global Environmental Objectives
(GEO)] and Key Indicators [as approved]:

The Project Development Objective of the Financial Management Capacity Building Project (FMCBP)
was to provide technical assistance and training programs to support the development of institutional
capacity to assist in the successful implementation of the government’s macroeconomic structural reform
program. The project would support both the achievement of the reform objectives and the long-term
development of institutional capacity through technical assistance, training programs and system
development in selected agencies in the Lao PDR. The project also aimed to provide a medium-term

    These documents were discussed at the Bank’s Board on April 24, 2001 (IDA/SecM/0216).


                                                     1
framework for Bank’s assistance. The FMCBP was also expected to provide a comprehensive framework
for consolidating and providing a strategic focus in capacity-building activities in the country.

The overarching key performance indicators were sustainable institutions, increased capacity for reform
implementation, and quality and sustainability of the policy reforms in the areas covered by the FMCBP.
The project’s original components are listed in Section 1.5 and Annex 2. The specific key performance
indicators (KPIs) for the three areas can be found in Annex 2 along with their results achieved at project
completion.

1.3    Revised PDO [GEO] (as approved by original approving authority) and Key Indicators,
and reasons/justification:

The restructured and scaled-up project was aligned with the government-approved reform program and
the bulk of the funding would support public finance management reforms. In accordance with this
program, the recalibrated project development objective was to improve the government’s budget
preparation, execution, reporting and auditing systems, to strengthen monitoring of state-owned
commercial bank (SOCB) operations, and to improve financial management of selected SOEs. There
were no changes to the general design and implementation modalities.

Two important developments affecting FMCBP’s implementation and operations justified and brought
about the above revision. First, the government significantly expanded the Public Finance Management
Strengthening Program (PFMSP) in order to meet the Nam Theun 2 (NT2) hydropower project's revenue
management arrangements. Second, the Asian Development Bank (ADB) and other development
partners provided significant assistance to the government for its financial sector reform program.
Accordingly, the resources required for effective implementation of the FMCBP’s public finance
management reform component were increased, while the funding need for its financial sector reform
component was reduced. The government requested, and the World Bank agreed, to redeploy FMCBP
resources to ensure better alignment with the emerging reform program. This was to be supported in two
ways: project restructuring and additional financing.

Rationale for Restructuring the Project. With the new interventions mostly related to the public finance
management sector, the remaining available funds from FMCBP would support implementation of the
PFMSP, and enhance support for the SOE restructuring program.

Rationale for Additional Financing. The additional resources would finance the interventions on the
implementation of the 2007 Organic Budget Law.2 The Law aimed to fundamentally transform the
intergovernmental fiscal framework by centralizing the National Treasury, the Tax Department, and the
Customs Department, and developing a more comprehensive intergovernmental fiscal framework that
would guide intergovernmental transfers. Significant technical assistance and systems development were
required for effective implementation of the Budget Law, as centralization was a new process for the
government and its implementing agencies.

The revised components are listed in detail in Section 1.6. The new and revised performance indicators
were approved for the project activities upon its restructuring and are included in Annex 2 with the results
achieved at project completion.


2
     The Law was approved by the National Assembly and subsequently signed by the President in February 2007.
The Prime Minister issued Decree 80 on February 28, 2007 on the new Ministry of Finance (MOF) structure and the
Finance Minister appointed a dedicated Steering Committee to develop respective implementing decrees and plans
to operationalize the Budget Law.


                                                      2
1.4      Main Beneficiaries (original and revised; briefly describe the “the primary target group?
identified in the PAD and as captured in the PDO[GEO], as well as any other individuals and
organizations expected to benefit from the project):

The targeted institutions included: Ministry of Finance (MOF) and its selected departments, Bank of Lao
PDR (BOL), Ministry of Planning and Investment (MPI, formerly Committee for Planning and
Cooperation (CPC)), various SOEs, and Ministry of Public Works and Transport (MPWT, formerly
Ministry of Construction, Transport, Post and Communication (MOCTPC)), Ministry of Justice (MOJ),
Committee for Business Development (CBD, formerly Business Promotion Office (BPO)), three SOCBs,
the National Assembly, and State Audit Organization (SAO, formerly National Audit Office (NAO)).
Building a stronger capacity for these institutions for policy formulation, implementation and oversight
would contribute to better management of the reform program and a better outcome in poverty reduction
by ensuring sustained long-term growth. The beneficiaries under the restructured project were the same
group. The interventions would help strengthen these institutions and assist with policy implementation
in public finance management, SOE restructuring, and financial sector reform.

       Component B: Public Finance Management Reform: This component would align fully its support
        to the government in the implementation of key elements of the PFMSP. The sub-components
        were: (i) Stabilization of the Government Financial Information System (GFIS); (ii) Strengthening
        External Debt Management; Support to Procurement Monitoring Office (PrMO); and (iii)
        Curriculum Strengthening and Upgrading for Training Institutes.
       Component C: SOE Reform and Business Development: This component continued to support the
        SOE reform and business development in the following three areas: (i) SOE Reform and Business
        Development Strategy; (ii) SOE Restructuring Program; (iii) Monitoring and Evaluation.

As noted earlier, the World Bank also approved additional grant financing to scale up some activities in
the FMCBP that would provide technical assistance, training, knowledge exchange visits, and goods
needed to implement some elements of the new Budget Law as follows:
   Development of a new intergovernmental fiscal framework;
   Implementation of the revised Chart of Accounts and budget nomenclature;
   Support towards Treasury centralization; and
   Strengthening external audit capacity.

1.7    Other significant changes (in design, scope and scale, implementation arrangements and
schedule, and funding allocations):

There were no other changes in design, scope and scale besides those outlined above. The
implementation arrangements would follow existing procedures already established. The additional
financing was an IDA grant of SDR 2.0 million (US$3 million equivalent), approved by the World Bank
Board in May 2007 (Section 1.6 discusses the revisions and changes, the resulting funding reallocations,
and their justification). In March 2010, there was another funding reallocation, Stage 2 Restructuring,
involving funds from the unallocated category to consultants, and from civil works (where there were
savings as the government used its own funds to rehabilitate the training center) to goods (where more
equipment was required for GFIS update).5 There were no changes in the PDO or any implementation
arrangements with this revision. The restructured and enhanced project was closed on April 30, 2011.

2.       Key Factors Affecting Implementation and Outcomes

2.1     Project Preparation, Design, and Quality at Entry (including whether lessons of earlier
operations were taken into account, risks and their mitigation identified, and adequacy of
participatory processes, as applicable):

The project’s overall quality at entry was rated moderately satisfactory.

Background and Lessons from Previous Operations. The lack of institutional capacity in the Lao PDR
was one of the major lessons from the three structural adjustment credits (SACs) financed by the Bank in
the 1990s. 6 The need to address this challenge was a compelling justification for the FMCBP to provide
the means for the government to strengthen its institutional capacity in implementing its reforms and, in
some cases, to address the inadequate staffing in many implementing units. The government also
assigned high priority to the development of its institutional capacity in order to be able to carry out its
reform program effectively. One of the alternatives to the FMCBP was to mobilize various trust funds

and grants to finance the government’s capacity building needs. However, the Bank rejected this
alternative, considering it ineffective since most trust funds would be tied to specific donors and there
would be high transactions costs for handling several funds and grants, posing considerable challenges in
ensuring timely funding availability for a comprehensive capacity building program.

Project Design Assessment. At appraisal, in light of these considerations and the country’s context, Bank
staff considered the overall framework of capacity building technical assistance under the FMCBP to be
an apposite vehicle to ensure good-quality capacity building activities, funding availability and timeliness,
and consistency and comprehensiveness of the program to meet the government needs for its reform
program. The ICR concurs with this conclusion, and considers that the project’s overall concept and
design were suitable to the Lao PDR as an initial but crucial bridge between the government’s existing
institutional capacity and its desire to carry out reforms in its transition to a market economy. A self-
standing technical assistance project would serve as an effective way to provide a medium-term
framework for capacity building and institutional strengthening for the government. The FMCBP would
also act as a logical channel for IDA to maintain a dialogue with the government on the reform program.
Capacity building activities would draw on donors’ recommendations, including ADB and IMF. Under
the circumstances at that time and from the lessons learned by the Bank on policy lending, the project’s
design was an appropriate vehicle to address directly some of the weaknesses in institutional capacity
while allowing for opportunities to adjust to and amend the newly emerging needs in this area with
flexibility toward available donor funding.

To build up the required institutional capacity, the project established detailed plans for the institutional
and implementation arrangements and management, especially with a project implementation unit and
staffing and administrative details to support implementation.7 The unit’s specially trained staff were
expected to assist MOF in the day-to-day management of the project to address the capacity and skills
demands and constraints. Flexibility of the funding and allocations were built into the project with
possibilities for substitution and reallocation between IDA and donor funds where needed. Grants from
donors could replace the project’s funding if available. This design addressed the government’s caution
in borrowing for capacity building, given its own limited resources for servicing its debts.

As noted previously, the FMCBP was also intended as a technical assistance companion project to the
Financial Management Adjustment Credit (FMAC) to support the implementation of key reform activities
committed by the government. The FMCBP was to provide immediate technical assistance to carry out
the reform program under FMAC and to ensure that these specific reform policies be carried out: “The
credit focused on strengthening the government capacity in undertaking the reform program under the
Bank’s proposed FMAC.?8 With this narrower definition, the FMCBP experienced some challenges at
the conclusion of FMAC. It also faced an adjustment in the government priorities and more availability
in grant support from donors. Subsequently, the FMCBP was restructured to effectively take account of
and adjust to the dynamic environment of a changing landscape in the development of the Lao PDR and
to address the overall need for capacity building, especially in the public sector.

Risk Assessment and Mitigation Measures. The FMCBP identified an extensive list of high risks and
measures to effectively mitigate them. The ICR concurs with the list of risks and their high rating. These
risks were adequately highlighted in Lao PDR, based on lessons learned with the Bank’s policy lending

manual and the appointment of the assistance project director as two effectiveness conditions.

                                                      5
experiences. The proposed measures under the project contributed effectively to addressing these risks
during implementation and helped advance the government’s capacity building program. The
establishment of the PIU was an effective measure which – despite its uncertain beginning and problems
with recruiting qualified staffing – contributed to the project’s satisfactory completion with the redesigned
and strengthened reorganization after project restructuring. Ongoing dialogues between the Bank and the
government and close monitoring and supervision efforts from the FMCBP team members greatly
minimized the above risks, provided timely input and advice to address a series of difficulties in the
implementation process, and brought the FMCBP to a satisfactory completion.

Adequacy of Government Commitment and Participatory Process. The Lao government showed its
serious commitment to reform with its willingness to borrow for a technical assistance credit at the time
of appraisal, underscoring its desire to strengthen its public sector capacity building to undertake the
reform program. The authorities were aware that the FMCBP could provide a strategic framework and
focus for capacity building and enable their control and ownership in implementing the capacity building
program.

During the project preparation, the Bank conducted an active dialogue with key players in relevant
agencies and ministries. Consultations with stakeholders were done through meetings and workshops on
key issues on capacity building. The Bank also maintained an active dialogue with bilateral and
multilateral donors to coordinate their assistance programs to enhance complementarities and avoid
duplication. The donor community endorsed the Bank’s efforts to consolidate all capacity building
activities into one coherent and coordinated framework with regular monitoring and evaluation as well as
forward planning. Regular consultations and inputs from bilateral donors and international financial
institutions were built into the project design. There was close cooperation and coordination between the
IMF and the Bank team in the analysis of and recommendations for the public sector reform program on
capacity building. Bank staff’s dialogues with stakeholders in the government and with the development
partners throughout the life of the project greatly contributed not only to keeping the FMCBP activities on
track but also maintaining its relevance to the government’s objectives and priorities, despite enormous
challenges due to the changing and dynamic development landscape.

2.2     Implementation (including any project changes/restructuring, mid-term review, project at
risk status, and actions taken, as applicable):

The FMCBP was implemented over a period of about nine years, with a total project cost estimated at
US$13.3 million equivalent. 9 The project was approved by the Bank’s Board on June 25, 2002 and was
declared effective on February 14, 2003. 10 MOF was the implementing agency, assisted by a stand-alone
Project Implementing Unit (PIU), later re-organized as Public Finance Management Strengthening Unit
(PFMSU) directly under MOF’s External Finance Relations Department (EFRD). The road to a
satisfactory completion of the FMCBP in April 2011 was quite long and arduous and its achievements,
while notable, were uneven among the components. The project closed with a satisfactory rating however
with all activities completed or achieved, despite numerous delays. It is useful to distinguish the two
distinctive stages of the project: (i) Stage 1: February 2003 to May 2007 (from effectiveness to
restructuring); and (ii) Stage 2: 2007-2011 (from restructuring to completion).

Stage 1: February 2003–May 2007. During this period, implementation of the project’s components was
uneven and characterized by long delays. With priority given to the activities under the FMAC, the
project’s first two years were mostly dedicated to their fulfillment. The Financial Sector Component

9
     Total project estimate was US$$8.5 million at appraisal and an additional grant of US$3 million equivalent at
restructuring. Total final project cost was US$13.3 million equivalent at project closing.
10
     The project’s three effectiveness conditions were met on February 7, 2003.


                                                         6
funded the external audits of the financial statements of the three SOCBs for 2001 and 2002. These were
completed in December 2003 and served as a useful baseline assessment to monitor SOCBs. SOCBs and
BOL were interested in continuing annual audits for subsequent years and these have been carried out
throughout the project, albeit under different funding sources. The SOE Reform Component supported
consultant assistance to develop management information and accounting systems for the MOF State
Asset Management Department (SAMD). SOE restructuring advisors assisted the Business Promotion
Office (BPO) to prepare diagnostic reviews. Nevertheless, the SOE reform and its capacity building
program which was developed in June 2004 was not approved by the Prime Minister’s Office (PMO)
despite the Bank’s intervention and recommendations through many supervision missions. The public
sector and training components made slower progress. The activities under the Public Sector Component
did not begin except for a Treasury-initiated activity to have a consultant help MOF implement its
treasury reform strategy. Some progress was recorded in development of a work program for this
component, but it was not finalized.

During this period, the PIU and its activities were driven by FMAC. At the same time, as with any newly
established organization, it was trying to establish its footing and was faced with challenges resulting from
changes in leadership and management, a lack of qualified staff and quick staff turnover, 11 and the need
for close direction and guidance from MOF in many administrative aspects. Consequently, the main task
of developing a comprehensive work program for capacity building was neglected and delayed.
Disbursements during this period were low and adversely affected by a new government decree stipulating
that grants would take precedence over concessional lending. The FMCBP was viewed as the last funding
resort for technical assistance and training activities. The project’s feature on alternative funding, noted
above, made it even more challenging to increase disbursements. At the project’s approval, nearly 40
percent of the funding was for unidentified activities; requests for new activities would need to go through
several layers of review which would involve numerous government agencies before final approval,
further discouraging the project’s disbursements.

The project appeared to stall toward the end of this period. The progress up to 2005 did not meet the
minimum level that should have been accomplished at that stage. The June 2005 ISR rated the progress
toward achieving the PDO as “moderately unsatisfactory?, implementation progress (IP) as
“unsatisfactory?; and project management and monitoring and evaluation as “moderately unsatisfactory?.
The project was classified as a “problem project? following its unsatisfactory rating.12 This affected the
overall project implementation schedule and made it clear that there was a need to assess the demand for
using the credit beyond its support for FMAC.

The government subsequently took some strong actions that eventually helped the FMCBP. First, in the
NT2 hydropower project, the government committed to significantly improving public finance
management through the high-profile Revenue Management Arrangements, and the FMCBP was
identified as the most appropriate vehicle for providing the needed technical assistance. Second, the
government adopted the Public Finance Management Strengthening Program (PFMSP). The PFMSP was
a multi-year medium-to-long term program to improve policy consistency, efficiency, transparency and
accountability in public finance management by strengthening institutional systems and capacity and
making progress toward adopting appropriate international financial management standards. The PFMSP
could reasonably provide a framework for implementing government policies and strategies laid out in the

11
     The Project Audit Report for 2003-04 noted that PIU staff lacked knowledge on accounting and the prescribed
accounting system in the Project Operation Manual (OM) was not consistently applied. The report recommended
that PIU staff be trained in financial and accounting system and made use of the OM.
12
     With regard to the project’s components, only the Financial Sector Restructuring Program Component was
rated as “moderately satisfactory? with the progress made on the audits of SOCBs. The other three components
slipped into “moderately unsatisfactory? (public sector reform and PIU) or “unsatisfactory? (SOE reform) rating.


                                                       7
“Policy Paper on Governance?, the National Growth and Poverty Eradication Strategy (NGPES), and the
National Socio-Economic Development Plan (NSEDP), 2006-2010 – and the umbrella program for
implementing the NT2 Revenue Management Arrangements. The FMCBP’s second component could
provide funding assistance to the PFMSP reform program. The project addressed three issues: (i) the
absence of a functional classification in the budget, making it impossible to determine programmatic
spending across sectors; (ii) the lack of an effective budget monitoring and execution system (the
Government Financial Information System (GFIS) was a very important first step but needed further
mainstreaming and implementation of an integrated financial management information system over time);
and (iii) the inadequate audit capacity at the SAO, which needed to develop and implement a
comprehensive capacity building program to improve its audit capacity. This component also provided
assistance to implement the new Budget Law. The FMCBP had found its niche in supporting the PFMSP.

The project’s rating was upgraded to moderately satisfactory in December 2005 for all the components
and implementation performance ratings with the exception of the monitoring and evaluation category,
which continued to be rated as moderately unsatisfactory. At this juncture, toward the end of 2005, the
government and the Bank started discussions on the possibility of restructuring the project. The Bank
appointed a new Task Manager (TM) in June 2006, who prepared and oversaw the restructuring together
with other team members in Bangkok, Vientiane, and Washington.

Stage 2: 2007-2011. In 2007, the Bank’s project team worked with the authorities on the restructuring to
realign the project toward emerging needs (Section 1.6) and possible additional financing to support the
scaled-up reforms under the public finance management component. The operation was appraised,
negotiated and approved by the Board in June 2007 with the new closing date of April 30, 2011,
effectively an extension of three years. The Additional Financing and Restructuring Project was declared
effective on October 18, 2007. The additional funding of US$3 million equivalent was in the form of an
IDA grant, which addressed the government’s concern about borrowing for technical assistance and
capacity building. The components and their changes and/or revisions are listed in Section 1.6.

The project proceeded with a new momentum under the supervision of the Bank’s TM and his team. The
FMCBP provided effective support to the Public Finance Management Component, the government’s
overall umbrella program in Public Finance Management, including activities on Treasury centralization,
budget execution and accounting related to income and expenditure management for the public sector.
The activities under the FMCBP brought about a real beginning of the Treasury centralization efforts by
the government, including training activities, workshops and consultations, culminating in the adoption of
the Decree on National Treasury in 2010. Implementing legislations included those for the Budget Law,
the Tax Law, the Accounting Law, the Decree on revenue sharing between central and local government.
The FMCBP supported three specific tasks under MOF’s Budget Department: (i) budget nomenclature;
(ii) implementing legislation under the Budget Law approved in 2006 and the decree in 2008; (iii) budget
norms; and (iv) exchange visits. The revised Chart of Accounts (COA) was endorsed for official use and
set up in all line ministries. The COA and the budget nomenclatures were aligned to meet the demand of
the Budget and the Treasury departments in the first basic stage of this activity.

The GFIS program and system acquired good basic hardware infrastructure to improve their operation
and the whole country has now been connected through the leased lines. One of the planned concrete
outputs for this activity would be the expected completion of the Financial Statements of the government
for the first time.

The management of the external debt at MOF benefitted from technical assistance from the United
Nations Conference on Trade and Development (UNCTAD), resulting in the first institutional steps
toward a more systematic monitoring and follow-up on the outstanding external public debts with trained
officials.


                                                    8
The FMCBP supported the SAO in its quest to fulfill its mandate. The campaign to raise public
awareness of the SAO’s role as an organization independent from the rest of the executive branch of the
government was carried out, providing audit reports to the National Assembly on a timely basis as well as
public disclosure in summarized form. The capacity building at the SAO (which will need to continue in
the medium-term with further assistance) was supported through training, workshops, seminars, study
tours, and consultant services. The comprehensive capacity building plan for the SAO was based on an
Audit Peer Review, also funded by the project. SAO has little by little become an important organization,
gradually being recognized by the public, and has made some early contributions to the government
objective for transparency and public accountability in the management of public resources at the
project’s completion.

For the SOE sector component, the Committee for Business Development (CBD, the tentative new name
of the BPO) received assistance to finance the preparation of the SOE strategy, the development of
restructuring plans in three phases and additional assistance for Phase 2 for four SOEs. The restructuring
plans for four SOEs were finalized and submitted to the government for consideration and action. The
draft SOE Sector Strategy was also prepared. The Strategy was adopted by all organizations concerned
and was submitted to the Cabinet for official approval in March 2011; however, because of the current
government’s reorganization, it is not yet on the Cabinet’s agenda at the time of the ICR. Nevertheless,
the SOEs have already used the restructuring plans, as this work provided useful recommendations on
better corporate management.

The quality and timeliness of delivery of outputs has been uneven, with delays throughout implementation
of the three sub-components. The FMCBP required close supervision and interventions from senior
government officials. Reasons for the delays include the fact that the implementing agencies were still
learning by doing and needed time to perform their tasks, and that processing and administrative
procedures required higher-level attention within MOF. The TM and the project team were proactive in
project management, with frequent meetings with the Chairperson of the Project Steering Committee
(PSC), the Vice Minister (VM) for Finance, to share the Bank’s concerns about the project’s slow
progress and its underlying causes. The VM was responsive and pushed the project implementation
forward, spearheading the government’s response to the Bank’s concerns at the mid-term review with a
report to address the bottlenecks in project management and presenting measures and a timeline to address
them. For the remaining period of the project to its closing in April 2011, the project implementation
benefitted from the intensive supervision by the TM and the project’s team members, and the VM’s close
attention.

A notable change in the restructured project was the reorganization of the PIU, which was fully integrated
into the EFRD and renamed the Public Finance Management Strengthening Unit (PFMSU).13 The
PFMSU managed the FMCBP and other grants for the Poverty Reduction Strategy Operation (PRSO)
series. The strengthened PFMSU strove to address the challenge of project management and the lack of
coordination with implementing agencies, as well as their lack of adequately skilled staff. The TM sought
the authority of the EFRD to empower the PFMSU to fulfill its mandate to support the implementing
agencies. All these efforts helped improve the management of the project. However, reflecting the
overall inadequate institutional capacity and the lack of delegated authority, project management in
general and the reconstituted PFMSU remained an issue for the Bank’s project team throughout the
project, necessitating close supervision by the TM with MOF senior management and by other project
team members in the areas covered under the components. This accentuated the fact that developing and

13
     The PFMSU includes a Director (government staff), technical specialist (government staff), procurement
specialist, procurement analyst, financial management specialist, two accountants, two secretaries, and a project
assistant.


                                                       9
building project management skills and institutional capacity would need to be done over time on a
continuous basis with sustained commitment from donors and government.

Reallocation of Funds - Stage-2 Restructuring. In November 2009, the government requested and the
Bank concurred with a reallocation of funds from the unallocated category to consultants; and from civil
works, where there were savings because the government decided to use its own funds to rehabilitate the
training center, to the goods category, to purchase equipment for the GFIS update and to set up the IT
room at the financial training center. There were no other changes envisaged in the PDO or the
implementation arrangements.

Project Disbursement and Arrangements. A special account was maintained in accordance with the
Development Credit Agreement (DCA) and managed by the project coordinator. Given the fact that this
was the first investment TA project for the MOF, disbursement arrangements were working and provided
effective support to the project implementation as the second stage of the project proceeded, with
continuing improvement in the PIU/PFMSU performance. A detailed monthly progress report was
prepared and included a financial statement by month, a statement on the special account, and the output
monitoring report for the components of the project. These are in the project’s files and filed in IRIS.
The project remains current with the submission of its audit reports and Financial Management Reports
(FMRs). The project also engaged the services of an international procurement advisor to strengthen
procurement capacity at PFMSU.

2.3     Monitoring and Evaluation (M&E) Design, Implementation and Utilization:

(a)     M&E Design. The original M&E framework was designed to address the government’s
inadequate institutional capacity by the establishment of a PIU to meet the project requirements. The
project was also overseen by the PSC, which provided policy direction and evaluated outcomes. The
FMCBP was built to be able to accommodate the government’s demand-driven capacity building needs.
The key indicators for the three components were kept simple and focused for ease of monitoring and
subsequent evaluation. Progress against these indicators was monitored through the collection of
information on actual adoption of key institution-strengthening measures, organization of training
programs, and technology support for the agencies and ministries supported by the project.

(b)      M&E Implementation. The indicators focused on the output or achievement of each activity. The
Bank’s project team and the government’s counterparts in all implementing agencies made great effort to
coordinate the work to ensure the gathered information’s quality and reliability. However, collecting and
tabulating data for each indicator to ensure their reliability continued to be a challenge, given the
responsible staff’s inexperience in these activities, and that the project was the first investment TA project
managed by MOF. Nevertheless, there was incremental but slow progress made throughout the project’s
life cycle on the type and accuracy of the information as the staff learned by doing, accumulating
experience in the process.

(c)      M&E Utilization. The project team collected appropriate data for evaluation and use from the
implementing agencies and sought to apply the data as a basis for decision-making and resource
allocation. The data being generated for the project’s components would serve as continuing outputs for
the implementing agencies in their reform program. For example, the GFIS has been in use with better
connectivity and stability. Government officials with GFIS training are currently working with the
system, which has been deployed in the finance departments of 37 ministries and 17 provinces with real-
time connectivity. The budget norms instituted with FMCBP help are now the basic framework for
allocation of resources to the health and education sectors. All these achievements have continued after
the project’s closure with some clear sustainability beyond the project’s life.



                                                     10
2.4    Safeguard and Fiduciary Compliance (focusing on issues and their resolution, as
applicable):

There are no social safeguard issues arising from the implementation of the FMCBP as the project was
granted a C rating. Fiduciary compliance was monitored closely throughout the project. The Bank task
team monitored the fiduciary compliance through the PIU/PFMSU and its reports.

There was one waiver during project implementation. The team sought and obtained approval from the
Bank’s Managing Director on the UNCTAD contract to supply and install the Debt Management and
Financial Analysis System (DMFAS) related to the Bank’s standard contract pertaining to anti-corruption.
A waiver was needed since the United Nations does not accept these clauses in any contract. The Bank’s
Managing Director allowed the waiver for two conditions from the Bank’s standard contract relating to
anti-corruption. The matter was resolved and UNCTAD was paid in full to install DMFAS and conduct
training.

The Bank has been working with the government and other development partners on an improved
framework for public procurement in the Lao PDR. The present public procurement framework includes
the key elements which, if implemented properly, could provide substantial benefits to the government
given that public procurement constitutes a significant part of the GDP. However, there have been
concerns about the slow pace of implementation of the procurement framework, which is not yet fully
functional due to ineffective monitoring of procurement performance and outcomes, and the procuring
agencies’ weak procurement capacity and lack of systematic verification of procedural compliance. The
Bank continues to have a close dialogue with the government, including priorities, needs, responsibilities
and time frame, working toward enabling implementation of the country procurement systems and
promoting harmonization and streamlining of procurement under foreign-assisted projects in Lao PDR,
particularly those financed by the World Bank and the ADB.

2.5     Post-completion Operation/Next Phase (including transition arrangement to post-
completion operation of investments financed by present operation, Operation & Maintenance
arrangements, sustaining reforms and institutional capacity, and next phase/follow-up operation,
if applicable):

In order to continue supporting the government of Lao PDR in implementation of the public finance
management strengthening program and supporting institutions for external accountability, the Bank is
preparing a follow-up public finance management project, building on the lessons learned from the
FMCBP. In the meantime, interventions are continuing through the multi-donor trust fund for the
PFMSP.

3.      Assessment of Outcomes
3.1     Relevance of Objectives, Design and Implementation (to current country and global
priorities, and Bank assistance strategy):

Capacity building remains consistent with the Bank’s CAS of March 2005 and continues to be an integral
part of the Bank’s priority assistance strategy for the Lao PDR, based on lessons learned from previous
Bank operations in the country. The capacity building objective, which accurately reflected the
government’s development priorities at project appraisal, was critical to the Lao PDR’s needs and
consistent with the goals and strategies identified by the government in the NGPES in 2005 and its
implementation plan, the NSEDP, 2006-2010. One of the priority pillars of the NSEDP was the strategic
approach to capacity development. The NSEDP sought to strengthen national capacity and institutions in


                                                   11
order to better implement the government’s reform program and to better manage public financial
resources and public service delivery capacities. Institutional capacity building and strengthening would
serve as an indispensable development tool to the subsequent implementation of the more comprehensive
reform strategy and program pursued by the government in its NGPES and supported by the donors and
the Bank’s PRSO series.

As noted earlier, the FMCBP’s focus on strengthening government capacity building was drawn from the
Bank’s experience with lessons from previous lending operations. However, once the project was
underway, the Bank’s project team experienced serious challenges in the implementation process despite
a careful initial design to mitigate potential risks, because of new developments with grant funding
availability and with the government’s changing emphasis on its development priorities. The restructured
project took into account the implementation experiences in the first phase and also realigned the PDOs
with the changes in emphasis for the public sector management and more concrete indicators (Section
1.6). With these revisions, the project was closely aligned with the government’s critical needs and was
brought to a satisfactory closure.

3.2     Achievement of Project Development Objectives [or Global Environmental Objectives]
(including brief discussion of causal linkages between outputs and outcomes, with details on
outputs in Annex 2):

The PDO focused on capacity building in three main areas: financial sector; public sector management;
and SOE reform. The ICR found that the PDOs of the FMCBP were achieved at the project’s closure,
contributing to the establishment of a relatively good foundation for the continuing development of
institutional capacity to support the government’s implementation of the macro-economic structural
reform program, especially in the public finance management sector. However, the achievements should
be qualified as uneven in the three areas covered by the project, as there was substantial progress in public
sector management activities but delays and slow progress in the financial sector during the
implementation period. Even within the public sector management component, some activities
experienced delays. The following section summarizes and evaluates the achievements in these areas.

Financial Sector Restructuring Program. The ICR rates the PDO achievement for this component as
moderately satisfactory. The outcome and output indicators were achieved, but the rating is moderately
satisfactory to reflect the challenges in fulfilling the indicators and the difficulties facing the BOL in
implementation of the actions. In the original PAD and in the revised Project Paper, stabilization of the
financial sector was a paramount objective of the restructuring program. The project achieved its
objective in supporting reforms to stabilize the SOCBs’ financial condition, strengthening BOL capacity
for supervision of banks through legislation and an action plan, strengthening the MIS system and
enhancing training for BOL officials. The restructured project supported completion of the Financial
Sector Strategy (FSS), provided critical means to improve data management and analysis, and brought
improvement to the BOL’s Credit Information Bureau (CIB). The FSS was completed and approved by
the government with a plan of action, albeit with delays. The BOL subsequently approved the Action
Plan for the FSS. External audits for Banque pour le Commerce Extérieur Lao (BCEL), Lao
Development Bank (LDB), and Agriculture Promotion Bank (APB) were completed in 2008 for BOL
which submitted them to MOF with BOL’s evaluation reports on these SOCBs’ performance against the
Governance Agreements. These documents provided timely information on the SOCBs’ financial
situation and contributed the first steps toward closer monitoring of this sector with the aim of
stabilization. The project strengthened the credit information capacity building, one of the building
blocks in the sector. The BOL has formed a technical peer-to-peer partnership with the CIB in Thailand.
The online CIB was launched in November 2010 and the system is now being used by commercial banks
and finance institutions. The reliability and accuracy of the data remain a great challenge for the CIB and



                                                     12
will need further care and attention to ensure continuous and sustained improvement. The work to
improve the timeliness of on-site evaluation reports has been making progress, with the cycle brought to
within 30 days.

Despite the uneven performance of the outputs in this sector, this component’s objective was met during
the project’s life cycle with the stabilization of the sector and the improvement of the BOL’s capacity in
monitoring and supervising the SOCBs. The institutional capacity in the BOL will continue to make
progress, albeit slowly, within the Bank’s supportive framework for the financial sector. 14

Public Sector Reform. The ICR rates the PDO achievement of this component as satisfactory. This
component was achieved and all the indicators completed. It is the most successful among the three
components as well as the most important component of the project, following the restructuring. Public
sector reform has received close attention and strong leadership from the MOF’s senior leadership under
the direction of the VM for Finance, who led the PFMSP Steering Committee. The project helped
establish the preliminary legal foundation for management of income-expenditure in the government
budget through key legislations such as the budget, tax, and accounting laws and their relevant
implementing decrees, which were conducted with extensive consultations and stakeholder participation.
Some key performance outcomes of the public sector reform component exceeded the project’s original
expectation in the following areas. The GFIS deployment was completed in October 2010 and the system
is now operational across the country, effectively addressing its connectivity and stability issues, though
with regular fine-tuning needs. SAO published a summary of audit findings for the FY2008/09 in the
public media. Although not a previously identified outcome indicator, the Value-Added Tax (VAT) was
implemented with the support of the project. The Treasury centralization was completed and all spending
accounts are now consolidated at the National Treasury. The technical inputs on budget norms were
completed and the application of the Budget Norms made significant progress during the last year of the
project’s life; their application has now been operationalized through the Budget Circular for FY2011/12.
The management of the country’s external debt was provided with a better means to monitor and
eventually manage the country’s external debt with the completed installation of the debt management
system and the debt database completed in October 2011. The Procurement Monitoring Office (PrMO)
was established and has begun on a preliminary basis its work in monitoring government procurement,
although it is still in the fledging stage, with very modest progress but with enormous challenges ahead.
As is the case with any new organization, the PrMO continues to chart its way to fulfill its mandate but
faces inadequate resources and the critical need to convince the rest of the government of its usefulness to
ensure transparency and fairness in public resource management. The curricula for the financial training
centers have been revised and aligned with the new requirements and responsibilities of the MOF,
consistent with the new Budget Law. Through all these activities, the project contributed to the
government’s institutional capacity building, especially the MOF. With the training centers and their
current curricula in place, the MOF will benefit from a sustained effort at capacity building and will be
empowered with the needed skills to manage the government’s reform program.

SOE Sector Reform. This component has achieved its objectives, including the development of the SOE
reform regulation and business strategy for the BPO; restructuring program for four SOEs, and building
monitoring and evaluation capacity of the BPO and the SAMD. The May 2010 completion of the audits
for all SOEs established the financial baseline information and positions for the SOE restructuring
program. Further, the audits for FY2004/05 and FY2005/06 for 14 SOES under Phase 1, 2, and 3
restructuring were completed. The project also helped achieve the formulation of the SOE sector strategy
which was finalized by the BPO by the end of 2009. The SOE financial situation has improved compared
with the baseline position, where there was no plan for restructuring loss-making SOEs and no

14
     Annex 2 presents the key performance indicators (KPIs) of this component, including those completed before
restructuring and those after restructuring at the project’s closure.


                                                       13
government strategy for the sector. In December 2010, the BPO submitted and the government approved
the restructuring plans for loss-making SOEs. Restructuring plans have been developed and
implementation has started for four SOEs. One of the outcomes of this activity contributed to the
reduction of arrears in the state-owned Electricity du Laos (EDL). The arrears, which were due to non-
payment of electricity use by government entities, have continued to be addressed each year and the
amounts have been reduced. Within the SOE strategy framework, the government has instituted budget
allocations for its electricity usage and provided adequate funds to settle these arrears to EDL.

Overall Assessment. Based on the assessment of the three components and the history of the project’s
implementation, and taking into account the achievements and importance of the these components, the
ICR rates the PDO’s overall achievement as moderately satisfactory, with the qualification that the PDO
will likely be sustained in the medium term, given the government’s continuing commitment to reforms
with a focus on capacity building as the means to achieve its strategy. The project’s PDO has been
strengthened through the Bank’s PRSO series and the NT2 project, which helped the Bank maintain an
active dialogue with the government and keep the momentum of reform. These projects have further
highlighted the need for deepening institutional capacity building and have reinforced the government’s
commitment, particularly through the MOF, to continue capacity building activities to implement their
reform program in an effective and timely way. In general, the ICR acknowledges the achievements of
the indicators supported by the project and considers them to be a good foundation to build and further
develop the government’s institutional capacity. But critical technical assistance needs to continue to
deepen these capacity building activities and to make them sustainable in the long run.

The overall ICR rating for the PDO is slightly different from the rating of satisfactory in the final ISR
because the ICR rating needs to consider the complete and overall assessment of the project, taking into
account the pre- and post-restructuring periods, with two moderately unsatisfactory ratings and two
unsatisfactory ratings for the implementation progress in the pre-restructuring period.

3.3    Efficiency (Net Present Value/Economic Rate of Return, cost effectiveness, e.g., unit rate
norms, least cost, and comparisons; and Financial Rate of Return):

Not applicable. The FMCBP was not required to undertake a NPV/REE analysis. An economic analysis
of the project’s benefit was also not applicable and was not included in the PAD due to the difficulty and
complication in defining, measuring and separating specific benefits of capacity building projects.
Nevertheless, the contribution of the FMCBP in the public management sector, in the stabilization of the
financial sector, and the strategy and restructuring of the SOEs has provided the means for the MOF and
the implementing agencies to operate more efficiently through training and other activities that improve
the skills and the capacity of public servants in these agencies.

3.4   Justification of Overall Outcome Rating (combining relevance, achievement of PDOs
[GEO], and efficiency):

Rating: Moderately Satisfactory
The project has achieved its overall objective, though with uneven speed across all components and a
restructuring, setting a preliminary but favorable stage for further capacity building activities in relevant
government institutions. The ICR’s overall rating for the PDO is moderately satisfactory (Section 3.2).

Within the country context and given the long-term needs for capacity building in the Lao PDR, the PDO
remains as relevant today as it was ten years ago when the project was appraised. The evidence so far
supports the assessment that the capacity building objective and its achievements could be sustained in
the country, given a positive environment buttressed by the government’s commitment to reform and its



                                                     14
ownership of the reform program, which has been actively supported by the Bank and the donor
community.

3.5    Overarching Themes, Other Outcomes and Impacts (if any, where not previously covered
or to amplify discussion above):

(a)     Poverty Impacts, Gender Aspects, and Social Development:

There is no direct impact on poverty, gender or social development. However, insofar as there is some
improvement in the government’s capacity to effectively manage public resources, this would result in
efficiency gains and better management of public service programs and deliveries. These would in turn
translate into better allocation of resources devoted to or relevant for the poverty reduction strategy and in
the delivery of public services to the poor and disadvantaged.

(b)    Institutional Change/Strengthening (particularly with reference to impacts on longer-
term capacity and institutional development):

The project contributed to institutional strengthening for MOF, SAO, BOL and other related ministries
and agencies as discussed above, with impact beyond the life of the project. Specifically, the MOF would
benefit from: an improved GFIS; stronger external debt management; an established PrMO; and upgraded
training institutions for its officials. SAO has further developed its auditing capabilities with more
transparency and accountability in public accounts. The project also provided support and input to the
BOL in its responsibility for monitoring and supervision of the banking and financial sector. These
institutional strengthening activities have set the stage for further long-term development activities for the
government in pursuit of its extensive reform program.

(c)     Other Unintended Outcomes and Impacts (positive and negative):

One of the outputs supported by the FMCBP was the successful introduction of the VAT in 2010, a by-
product not initially planned, both in the original design and in the restructuring project. The government
was keen on VAT implementation and requested Bank assistance to support this activity from FMCBP
resources, with technical assistance to the Tax Department along with training courses for MOF staff.
This activity was carried out successfully and the government was pleased with the results, which showed
a very positive impact on government revenue collections.

3.6    Summary of Findings of Beneficiary Survey and/or Stakeholder Workshops (optional for
Core ICR, required for ILI, details in annexes):

Not applicable.

4.      Assessment of Risk to Development Outcome
Rating: High
The risk to development outcomes remains high despite the detailed mitigation measures put in place and
implemented by the project, given the time-consuming characteristics and long gestation effects of
technical assistance. The government has been implementing some very complex reforms with limited
and constrained capacity. Although the focus on capacity building has been significant and outcomes
have been realized, key personnel risk remains high. There will be a need to offer continuing follow-on




                                                     15
support to the government to deepen the capacity building activities in order to address this institutional
challenge, and to help determine how best to organize the capacity thus far developed.

The next risk to the development outcome would be the ability for MOF to continue to coordinate within
their own departments in particular and across other ministries and agencies in general to keep the
momentum of reforms for the PFMSP. As the project involved many ministries and agencies, the ICR
rates this risk as substantial since activities that could be continued after the project would need close
cooperation between MOF and relevant ministries and agencies. In addition, staff constraints and their
capacity in these ministries and agencies would constitute an additional challenge for MOF in its
coordinating role of managing reforms pursued by the government.

5. Assessment of Bank and Borrower Performance (relating to design, implementation and
outcome issues)

5.1 Bank

(a) Bank Performance in Ensuring Quality at Entry (i.e., performance through lending phase):

Rating: Moderately satisfactory
The project design benefitted from the lessons learned by the Bank through the previous series of
structural adjustment operations and the experience gained in the design and implementation of these
quick-disbursing lending operations. The Bank highlighted appropriately the government’s capacity
building requirements and the need for the FMCBP to focus on the three identified areas for capacity
building in support of policy-making and resource management. The preparation in terms of background
studies for FMCBP and FMAC was substantial, and the participatory process in design was relevant and
extensive. The project also benefitted from the extensive work done for the NT2 project in terms of
capacity building and management of public resources.

The ICR considers the Bank performance in the design as moderately satisfactory, given the fact that the
design of the PIU, the most important factor in the project implementation, was not adequate to handle the
complexity in managing a project and the changing environment. In hindsight, the project seems to
emphasize the reliance on the PIU/PFMSU to manage and implement the project, one of the weaknesses
in design since the PIU/PFMSU itself initially lacked the skills and experience to manage the project,
despite the detailed TORs for its staff.

(b) Quality of Supervision (including of fiduciary and safeguards policies):

Rating: Satisfactory
The supervision of the project was considered satisfactory. Several quality strengths, especially after the
project restructuring, helped bring the project to a satisfactory closing with considerable institutional
development impact during the fledging but difficult stage of capacity building. These contributed to
moving the project from an unsatisfactory rating after three years of implementation to a successful
restructuring and satisfactory conclusion. The project benefitted from the continuous leadership of one
TM, the extensive contribution from the project team members in the field and from headquarters, and the
support from Bank management, especially during and after the restructuring exercise, from 2007 to 2011.
This continuity and extensive support helped build a strong working relationship between the project team
led by the TM with the government counterparts and flexibility in collaborating and adapting to the
existing capacity of the MOF and the PIU/PFMSU. The TM and the project team members spent a
significant amount of time in supervision to provide implementation support in term of capacity building
to the unit. The TM’s location in Bangkok allowed for frequent missions, ease of communications, and


                                                    16
building a strong client-oriented and flexible approach to project supervision. The Bank and the project
team members were proactive in restructuring the project, with detailed and careful preparations to
support and recommend an action plan for a comprehensive and complementary restructuring. The
restructuring reflected an appropriate balance between adaptation to the changing situation on the ground
and focus on current priorities while being supportive of the government’s needs and concerns. The
reorganization of the PIU/PFMSU helped mitigate one of the weaknesses in project implementation to a
large extent, and its continuing improvement contributed further to a satisfactory conclusion with
considerable impact, enhancing the possibility of sustainability of the activities beyond the project.

(c) Justification of Rating for Overall Bank Performance:

Rating: Moderately Satisfactory
The ICR rates the overall Bank performance as moderately satisfactory. This takes into account the
moderately satisfactory rating for quality at entry and the satisfactory rating for the Bank’s supervision,
and lastly the moderately satisfactory rating for the overall project outcome.

5.2     Borrower Performance

(a) Government Performance:

Rating: Moderately Satisfactory
During the project preparation, the government showed a strong commitment to the important objective
of capacity building by agreeing to borrow for technical assistance. The government recognized the
critical need for assistance for a comprehensive capacity building and strengthening approach to enable it
to implement the reform program in FMAC and for other projects such as the NT2. These projects would
not be brought about unless there was a serious attempt to address the inadequate institutional capacity.

However, the sustained commitment to the project objective seemed to vary among the beneficiary
ministries and agencies. The government’s coordinating mechanism – an important factor in this project
– was not strong and had not been tested enough to manage the various demands and requirements among
the concerned departments and agencies. While the authorities recognized the urgency of capacity
training, there was no strong consensus to borrow to build its capacity; the preference for grant funding
for this activity seemed to dominate senior leaders’ thinking. Taking into account the balance of the
issues discussed above, the ICR rates the government performance as moderately satisfactory.

(b) Implementing Agency or Agencies Performance:

Rating: Moderately Satisfactory
The PIU/PFMSU performance was uneven, with ISR ratings for overall project management ranging
from moderately unsatisfactory (in three ISRs) to highly satisfactory. The highly satisfactory rating was
recorded at the beginning of project implementation, but it deteriorated to moderately unsatisfactory prior
to the project’s restructuring; however, it showed an improvement to moderately satisfactory once the
restructuring was implemented, with the exception of one moderately unsatisfactory rating in the ISR of
2010 a year prior to the project closing. As noted, the PIU was initially designed with a detailed
organizational chart and specific duties to ensure consistent implementation of the FMCBP and the
FMAC. Despite the Bank team’s effort and care in the design and establishment of this unit, it was not
able to function as an independent operating unit as originally envisaged due to the staffing issue and its
delicate relations with MOF. Upon restructuring, the PIU was reconstituted as the PFMSU and integrated
into the MOF’s EFRD. With adequate capacity and leadership, it was to be the vehicle to contribute in



                                                    17
terms of human resources for the MOF to be able to deliver on the government program. In practice,
while the reconstituted PFMSU was able to improve further with learning by doing and enjoyed direct
MOF support to manage the project and close attention from MOF high-level management, it still
experienced inadequate capacity, especially in managing multiple activities in different areas,
necessitating close supervision from Bank staff. For these reasons, the ICR rates the overall performance
of the implementing agency as moderately satisfactory.

(c) Justification of Rating for Overall Borrower Performance:

Rating: Moderately Satisfactory
The ICR rates the overall borrower performance as moderately satisfactory, based on a moderately
satisfactory rating for the performance of both the government and the implementing agency.

6.      Lessons Learned (both project-specific and of wide general application)

The following lessons could be drawn from the FMCBP:

Necessity for accurate assessment of the recipient’s capacity on the ground, within and among the
existing institutional environment, when designing a capacity building technical assistance project and
the project implementing unit. The FMCBP demonstrates that the project implementing unit – even if
well designed, restructured and bolstered – is not a guarantee for a technical assistance project to be
successful, especially in a country with inadequate technical capacity and widely different degrees of
technical skills. The PIU suffers from inadequate management and poor coordination with its managing
ministry in particular and with implementing agencies in general, due to lack of able personnel and/or
lack of authority to coordinate and cooperate. The PIU/PFMSU was not able to organize and operate
effectively without skilled staff and the right skill mix even with experienced and well-connected senior
management. The Bank, in retrospect, overestimated the capacity of the country to manage a technical
assistance project through a PIU/PFMSU.

Effective organization of the implementation capacity to support the capacity building agenda in a
country with low capacity. The FMCBP highlights the experience from initially seeking a strong PIU
organization structure to compensate for low national capacity to deliver timely outputs to relying on
existing capacity for project implementation, perhaps at the expense of expediency. While a strong PIU
could deliver some outputs on time, more often than not its staff had to work within the existing low-level
capacity environment. This critical factor affected the project implementation across the board. The
FMCBP shows that a strong PIU could be effectively used to focus on certain critical areas where strong
capacity is needed to bring about timely results. But for a capacity building project in general, it is
beneficial to take into account and to work with the country’s existing capacity and given environment to
best support the capacity building agenda.

Critical needs for simplified documentation in order to help PIU staff manage project activities and to
provide effective assistance and guidance to officials in the implementing agencies. For the FMCBP,
language differences and understanding English were two bottlenecks for the PIU/PFMSU staff.
Understanding procurement documents in English was especially an enormous challenge for PFMSU staff
in their daily responsibilities. They needed to digest new and complex concepts presented in a style of
English that is open to different interpretation and translation. To aggravate the challenge, PIU staff had
to explain these concepts to their counterparts in the implementing agencies.

The guiding principles for project implementation arrangements between the project’s steering
committee, managing agency, PIU, and implementing units need to be effectively practiced and followed.



                                                   18
One of the leading causes of delays for the FMCBP remained the numerous and overlapping internal
reviews and approval procedures in the borrower’s institutions. These translated into slow progress for
the policy reforms in the PFMSP. The PSC would need to play a more active role in facilitating cross-
agency coordination and streamlining institutional procedures and give more weight to the PIU/PFMSU to
enable it to carry out its mandate.

Due to the need for intensive supervision, a technical assistance project would require adequate funding
and staffing to be able to address and manage challenges at the implementation stage, some of which were
unexpected and unanticipated. The need for intensive supervision would clearly benefit from the
continuing and close presence of the TM and the core project team. The TM, in close cooperation with
other team members in the field and at headquarters, maintained the implementation momentum for the
project through actively coordinating the trouble-shooting activities among Bank staff and government
officials for all the challenges and bottlenecks facing the project.

Given the above issues, any changes in staffing of the project, especially the TM, would adversely affect
project implementation, as the FMCBP experienced during the first few years of its implementation. For
a technical assistance project, this lesson would be critical in ensuring that the project achieved its
objectives.

The flexibility in funding resources – a special feature of the FMCBP – was meant to address the
government’ preference for grant funding in technical assistance and to respond to unanticipated demands
during the implementation stage. However, it was one of the causes for delay in implementation at the
outset, when other donor grant funds were made available and when there were still some undefined
needs for technical assistance among the implementing agencies. To minimize this delay and uncertainty,
the project could provide a clear definition of what funding flexibility would actually mean, including
concrete built-in alternative solutions and a list of specific and selected activities to be agreed with
implementing agencies identified at the design stage.

The government needs to be in the driver’s seat with clear ownership of the capacity building program.
This principle was demonstrated in the FMCBP implementation. Initially, the FMCBP was used to
support a Bank-initiated program and the FMCBP was almost half-heartedly carried out due to a lack of
ownership among the implementing agencies, accentuated further by the government’s reluctance to
borrow given the availability of other grant sources. However, as the government focused on the PFMSP,
which was a government-owned program authorized by the Prime Minister's Office, the FMCBP was
seen by the implementing agencies as an effective vehicle to carry out this program. The project was
recalibrated and quickly restructured at the request of the authorities, and was used effectively by the
implementing agencies to support the relevant policies in the PFMSP, reflecting each agency’s strong
ownership in their capacity building program.

The effective interplay among different instruments and operations would be a prerequisite factor for a
successful technical assistance program. The PFMSP was brought about by the government commitment
to fulfill the requirements of the NT2 project on revenue management arrangements and the PRSO
operations, both of which provided policy-level commitment from the authorities to conduct the reforms.
FMCBP provided the investment know-how on implementing policies called for in these operations.
FMCBP served as an effective vehicle to implement extensive capacity reforms in support of and in
coordination with the other operations and different instruments which are brought to bear together.

Within the Public Finance Management component, adequate training resources would be a prerequisite
for a technical assistance project, especially in the training of the PIU staff so that they could be effective
and proactive in project management activities. This unit would need a proper skill mix in order to be
able to “hit the ground running?, to collaborate with the implementing ministry, to coordinate among the


                                                     19
agencies involved and to spearhead project activities. Thus, a concrete sequencing or a roadmap of the
training activities for the PIU would provide a good basis for project implementation.

7.      Comments on Issues Raised by Borrower/Implementing Agencies/Partners

(a)     Borrower/implementing agencies:

In its review, the government concurs in overall terms with the Bank’s assessment of the project and the
issues which arose during its implementation. The authorities highlighted the benefits brought about by
the project, serving as a strong foundation for the government’s capacity building program to continue to
be built and expanded. During the ICR mission, officials from the implementing agencies expressed their
satisfaction with the activities accomplished under this project and their wish for further assistance from
the Bank as they wished to move to the next stage of their capacity-building program.

Annex 2. Outputs by Component

The Restructured Project Development Objective was to improve the government’s budget preparation,
execution, reporting and auditing systems, to strengthen monitoring of SOCBs operations, and to improve
financial management of selected SOEs, and the original and revised outcome indicators as well as the
intermediate outputs are listed below:

Outcome Indicator(s) - from Project Appraisal Document and Project Paper
Baseline Values from Project Outcome Indicators/Date of Value (from approval documents)

                                         INDICATORS and RESULTS
                          Financial Sector Reform
 IO Indicator 1 (FIN)     Completion of external audit of the December 2001 Accounts of three state owned
 (original indicator)     commercial banks (SOCBs) by international auditors.
                          This indicator which was the original indicator of the project has been achieved and
                          BOL ensures that commercial banks conduct external audits annually by international
                          auditors from 2002 onward. Audits for BCEL, LDB and APB as end-December 2001
                          were completed. Since then, the SOCBs undertake timely audits using their own
                          resources by internationally reputed audit companies.
 IO Indicator 2 (FIN)     Financial and operational review and restructuring of the three SOCBs.
 (original indicator)
                          This activity is completed for 2003 and 2004 for the BCEL, LDB, and APB. The
                          completed financial and operational review and restructuring of the three SOCBs
                          provided the BOL much needed information to monitor them. After several series of
                          reviews, the CAR ratio of the three SOCBs, was recorded at 7.02 percent in June 2011
                          and the NPL ratio was reduced to 2.08 percent. The government has initiated the
                          financial and operational review in order to restructure the three SOCBs in phases. The
                          first review of BCEL and LDB was completed in 2003, and followed by APB in 2004.
 IO Indicator 3 (FIN)     Development of a voluntary framework for non-performing loans (NPL) resolution.
 (original indicator)     This sub-component was supported by the TA from ADB.
                          At the restructuring of the project, this sub-component was scaled down because ADB
                          was taking the lead on the financial sector with support from a Technical Assistance
                          Grant instrument.
 IO Indicator 3A          Final on-site examination report of commercial banks to be completed by 30 days from
 (FIN) for the            on-site visitation date to commercial banks. The baseline was more than 60 days.
 Restructured Project
                          This indicator is fully achieved. The TA has helped to enhance BOL’s supervision
                          capacity and contributes to better information flow within the Supervision Department
                          for better banking environment with on-site reports down to within 30 days post-site
                          visitation. With the completion of on-site report within 30 days after visitation,
                          commercial banks can take timely actions which contribute to the result of better
                          banking environment. Final on-site examination report of commercial banks completed
                          within 30 days from on-site visitation date.
 IO Indicator 4 (FIN)     Enhancement of BOL supervisory capacity; through directed training.
 (original indicator)
                          At the restructuring of the project, this sub-component was scaled down because ADB
                          was taking the lead on the financial sector with support from a Technical Assistance
                          Grant which funded the activity towards improving data management in the Bank and
                          Financial Institution Supervision Department (BFSD) at the BOL. Banking officials
                          have received internal training with the CAMEL principles; Study tours and exchange
                          of practical experiences on the banking and financial sectors were organized.




                                                       22
IO Indicator 5 (FIN)   Establishment of policy framework and enabling environment for sustainable rural and
(original indicator)   micro-credit.
                       At the restructuring of the project, this sub-component was scaled down because ADB
                       was taking the lead on the financial sector with support from a TA Grant. Later, policy
                       support for this measure was provided through PRSOs. While it was not included in
                       the restructured project, this indicator was achieved with the establishment of
                       legislative framework governing rural and micro-credit, namely by BOL’s regulations
                       on microfinance institutions was reviewed in 2011 under PRSO-7 policy actions.
IO Indicator 6 (FIN)   Development of appropriate MIS systems to support customer service and information
(original indicator)   management in the banking sector.
                       At the restructuring of the project, this sub-component was scaled down because ADB
                       was taking the lead on the financial sector with support from a Technical Assistance
                       Grant. This activity continues under ADB assistance to the banking sector.
IO Indicator 6A        Credit Information Bureau (CIB) improvement. 50 percent of loan accounts reported in
(FIN) for the          CIB system by 2009. At the restructuring, there is no systematic reporting of loan
Restructured Project   accounts, and only large loans are reported on a random basis.
                       The online CIB was official launch on 2nd November 2010. Commercial banks have
                       used the program in order to report the loan accounts to CIB. 70 percent of the
                       information on loan accounts was captured from the whole loan accounts information
                       requirement. However, there are still challenges to make the system reliable and
                       functional and to ensure accurate input and data. To date, Commercial Banks have
                       confirmed 90 percent of loan accounts reported are complete and they have solved
                       some problems. Commercial banks must access clients’ information before
                       issuing/approving the loans to make sure that the banks have enough and accurate
                       information on the clients’ credit history. The CIB set up the credit information system
                       and requested all commercial banks to report their loan information. The banks have
                       used this credit record in their credit analysis and credit risk management process. This
                       has resulted in better quality loans with lower default rate.
IO Indicator 7 (FIN)   Training for BOL/MOJ/MOF/RMFC staff to assist with the implementation of the MIS
(original indicator)   system to be developed.
                       This sub-component was transferred to the EU and funded by the Technical Assistance
                       from EU. This activity continues through this support.
IO Indicator 8 (FIN)   Targeted training for banking personnel in Lao PDR.
(original indicator)
                       This sub-component was transferred to the EU and ADB and funded by the Technical
                       Assistance from EU and ADB. The training under this activity was funded and
                       continues under EU and ADB support.

                       Public Expenditure Reform
IO Indicator 1 (PER)   Budget Planning - establishment of guidelines and methodologies for future recurrent
(original indicator)   costs of investment projects and dissemination of guidelines through workshops and
                       seminars.
                       This indicator is completed during the first phase of the project. However, the
                       establishment of these guidelines and methodologies would need to be followed up
                       with implementation, some of which were being carried during the restructured project
                       (please see the additional indicator below).
IO Indicator 1A        Allocation of resources to health and education made on the basis of a set of Budget
(PER) for the          Norms by FY2009/10.
Restructured Project
                       This indicator is completed. Allocation of resources to health and education made on
                       the basis of a set of Budget Norms by FY2009/10. This indicator was achieved despite
                       a lag of two fiscal years due mostly to the protracted discussions within the government



                                                    23
                        on norm applications. Norms for health and education sector operationalized through
                        budget circular for FY2011/12.

IO Indicator 2 (PER)    Revised budget classification to allow identification of expenditures by ministry,
(original indicator)    province, and service.
                        This activity was completed, albeit with some delays. The Minister of Finance
                        approved the revised budget classification in April 2007. The challenge would be the
                        actual implementation of the budget classifications in the government annual exercise
                        on budget preparation and execution. Some of the follow-up activities were factored in
                        the restructured project (please see below).
IO Indicator 2A         Revised budget classification deployed for the Budget by FY2008/09 allowing for
(PER) for the           information on functional classification of the budget.
Restructured Project
                        This action is completed. Revised budget classification approved by the Minister of
                        Finance in April 2007 and deployed through the GFIS for FY2008/09. Revised budget
                        classification deployed for the budget by FY2008/09 with information on functional
                        classification.
IO Indicator 3 (PER)    Extension of pilot accounting system and computer systems to all line ministries and
(original indicator)    larger provinces.
                        GFIS rolled-out to all provinces and ministries by January 2006 and completed by
                        October 2006. This activity has been completed, albeit with two-year delay. Further
                        enhancement and strengthening of the system have also been made under the
                        Restructured Project (please see below), enabling the GFIS to serve the whole country.
                        Training was provided through training for the trainer and for the user of the system.
IO Indicator 3A         Budget execution reports prepared in time for the National Assembly presentation of
(PER) for the           the budget starting with FY2007/08, by stabilizing the GFIS environment, and
Restructuring Project   increased training in its usage and improved connectivity.
                        GFIS software was revised and a new chart of accounts was implemented through the
                        system and approved for official use. GFIS environment has been stabilized and there
                        has been increased training in its usage and improved connectivity. This action is
                        completed and contributed to the government strategy to enhance the management of
                        its public resources and budget planning and execution exercises. GFIS rolled-out to
                        all provinces and ministries by January 2006 and completed by October 2006 (please
                        see above). GFIS is now functional across all provinces and capable of producing in-
                        year budget reports.
IO Indicator 4 (PER)    Completion of an expenditure tracking survey in education sector.
(original indicator)
                        This activity was completed as scheduled. The survey was completed and several
                        workshops were organized to disseminate the findings. These helped improve the
                        monitoring of education expenditure in the Ministry of Education and contributed to the
                        work on budget norms at the MOF
IO Indicator 5 (PER)    Completion of comprehensive review and adoption of recommendation of oversight
(original indicator)    bodies, i.e., National Audit Office (NAO), State Inspection Agency.
                        This action is completed with the new Audit Law submitted to the National Assembly
                        in July 2008. The Law grants autonomy to SAO from the Executive branch with the
                        mandate to submit audit reports for the preceding fiscal year to the National Assembly
                        at the June session. After the approval of the Budget Law and the Audit Law in 2008,
                        audit reports have been submitted to the National Assembly nine months after the end
                        of the fiscal year and are subsequently published in summary form in newspapers.
IO Indicator 5A         Improve audit quality by supporting a comprehensive capacity-building plan for the
(PER) for the           State Audit Organization (SAO --formerly NAO) based on an Audit Peer Review by
Restructured Project:   December 2010.
                        This action is completed. The Audit Law grants autonomy to SAO from the Executive



                                                    24
                       branch with the mandate to submit audit reports for the preceding fiscal year to the
                       National Assembly at the June session. After the approval of the Audit Law and also
                       the Budget Law, audit reports have been submitted to the National Assembly nine
                       months after the end of the fiscal year and are subsequently published in summary form
                       in newspapers. Audit Peer Review completed and audit quality improved.
                       SAO is now an autonomous agency from the Executive Branch and reporting its audits
                       to the National Assembly on an annual basis.
IO Indicator 6 (PER)   Adoption overtime of streamlined international public sector accounting standards.
(original indicator)
                       At the restructuring of the project, this sub-component was transferred to the ADB and
                       was supported by the Technical Assistance Grant from ADB which would assist the
                       government in the process to adopt streamlined international public sector accounting
                       standards. This activity is on-going.
IO Indicator 7 (PER)   Establishment of a Procurement Monitoring Office (PrMO) to monitor procurement
(original indicator)   procedures.
                       This action was completed. The Procurement Monitoring Office (PrMO) established in
                       2008/09. Standard bidding documents for procurements have been prepared but not
                       widely used. However, PrMO is still working to make a meaningful contribution to the
                       procurement work of the government and faces numerous challenges ahead.
IO Indicator 7A        Standard bidding documents for procurement operation operationalized for use by the
(PER) for the          government.
Restructured Project
                       This action was completed. Standard bidding documents were issued in April 2010. A
                       procurement web site has been established. As noted previously, the PrMO is working
                       toward recognition and acceptance among ministries and agencies.
IO Indicator 8 (PER)   Launch a government wide training program for procurement monitoring and financial
(original indicator)   management.
                       This activity was launched and the process was on-going throughout the project
                       lifecycle. The Restructured Project provided resources for follow-up activities (see
                       below)
IO Indicator 8A        New curriculum aligned to new MOF responsibilities as per new organic Budget Law
(PER) for the          adopted, increased computer-user ratio, increase in library material access and
Restructured Project   improved infrastructure of MOF training centers – as per the PFMSP.
                       This activity has been accomplished. MOF prepared a comprehensive Human
                       Resource Management Strategy with support from JICA. Curricula of MOF financial
                       training centers have been updated and teacher training have been accomplished. MOF

                       Master Plan prepared by MOF, the curriculum of MOF training centers has been
                       reviewed and revised to be suitable with the new Budget Law. Other donors are
                       continuing to provide support to this work.

                       technical assistance through the Multi-Donor Trust Fund managed by the World Bank.
                       Advisors worked with the government to devise a treasury centralization masterplan
                       and a human resource master plan. Workshops, seminars and exchange were
                       organized.

                       continuing training demand in these areas for more staff and more members and the
                       government will need to maintain a continuing training program to maintain and
                       upgrade the institutional capacity that would enable the government to keep the
                       momentum on management of the reform program.

                      Norms for the health and education sectors have been operationalized through budget circulars for
                      FY2011/12.

                      envisage that the audit report would be published in newspapers.
                      The government has drafted concept notes for budget norms to phase in for the FY2012 budget.
                      Technical work on the norms is completed and the MOF is expected to operationalize norms through
                      budget circular for FY2011/12 budget after government discussion with provinces.
                      In addition, the new Budget Law was promulgated in 2006 and has progressively been implemented
                      since then with FMCBP support. Other legislations approved by the National Assembly and their
                      implementing decrees by the government have contributed to and served as the foundation for the

               Comments       The online CIB was official launch on 2 November 2010. Commercial banks have used the
    (incl. % achievement)     program in order to report the loan accounts to CIB. 70 percent of the information on loan
                              accounts was captured from the whole loan accounts information requirement. However, there
                              are still challenges to make the system reliable and functional and to ensure accurate input and
                              data. To date, Commercial Banks have confirmed 90 percent of loan accounts reported are
                              complete and they have solved some problems. Commercial banks must access clients’
                              information before issuing/approving the loans to make sure that the banks have enough and
                              accurate information on the clients’ credit history.

achievements such as the GFIS and Budget Norm for allocation of resources to the health and


                                              46
education sectors have been continuing after the project’s closure with clear sustainability
beyond the project’s life. Some lessons learnt were learnt through implementation of the project
as follows:

3.1 Project Management:
    - The Project Steering Committee and External Finance Department had always provided
       supervision and support to the project for the successful implementation.
    - All the Implementing Agencies had always been in cooperation with the PFMSU to
       fulfill their implementation.
    - The Project Task Team and the mission from the World Bank were in close supervision
       with the government’s counterparts in all the implementing agencies to ensure quality
       and reliability of the information obtained.

3.2 Financial Management:
    - A using of regulation on expenditures related to training activities was very complicated
       due to a using both of Government and World Bank’s guidelines which made confusing
       to IAs. Therefore, WB team should decide to use only one regulation.
    - Lack of FM’s staffs that has knowledge and experience concerning the World Bank’s
       guidelines and accounting software.

3.3 Procurement Management
    - Some procurement of goods and consultant services has been delayed due to a long
       process and the use of procurement method such as using International Competitive
       Bidding (ICB) and National Competitive Bidding (NCB) took more than six months.
       This process should be improved.
