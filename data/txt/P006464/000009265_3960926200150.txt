MEMORANDUM AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT
OF THE INTERNATIONAL BANK FOR RECONSTRUCTION AND DEVELOPMENT
TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS
ON A PROPOSED LOAN
TO THE FEDERATIVE REPUBLIC OF BRAZIL
FOR THE FOURTH AGRO-INDUSTRIES CREDIT PROJECT
1.       The following memorandum and recommendation on a proposed loan to
the Federative Republic of Brazil for US$300 million is submitted for
approval. The proposed loan would be repayable in 15 years on a fixed
amortization schedule, including 5 years of grace, at the Bank's standard
variable interest rate and help finance an agro-industries credit project.
2.       Background.  In Brazil there are essentially two credit systems:
the official system in which interest rates are controlled and credit is
administratively allocated; and the commercial system in which credit
markets are largely uncontrolled and credit is supplied voluntarily at
market determined rates. At present, official credit comprises the bulk
(nearly 90Z) of all rural credit to farmers. The principal sources of
official credit for industry, including agro-industries, have been: (i) the
federal development bank (BNDES); and (ii) Central Bank discounts (often
with assistance from bilateral and multilateral funds). In the case of
agriculture (i.e. farmers), the p.incipal sources have been: (i) Government
funds channelled mainly through the federal commercial bank -- Bank of
Brazil (BB); (ii) Central Bank discounts; (iii) the compulsory application
system in which commercial banks (federal, state and private) are required
to apply a fixed percentage of their sight (demand) deposits to rural
credit at official (subsidized) rates; an', (iv) more recently (since
1987), the interest-bearing rural savings deposits held in BB and a few
other federal and regional banks. Under today's extremely uncertain
economic and political conditions, voluntary term (investment) lending in
Brazil for any purpose has disappeared. Consequently, all term or
investment credit is currently being supplied by the official system.
3.       The agricultural sector's heavy dependence on official credit has
not only distorted resource allocation decisions and imposed a significant
fiscal burden on the Government, but, contrary to stated objectives, it has
not benefitted the small producers. Faced with major fiscal problems and
being unable to sustain large credit subsidies, the present Government is
prepared to undertake agricultural credit reforms and, for this purpose,
has asked the Bank for assistance, of which the proposed project is an
essential component. The Government, for its part, has prepared a program
to contract the supply of official credit to the agricultural sector,
including agro-industries, over the three-year period 1988-1990 and is now
implementing it. This program includes real reductions in official credit,
which in 1990 compared to 1987 (a year in which official credit had already
been substantially cut in real terms) amount to 22Z for long-term
(investment) rural credit, 12% for short-term (inputs and marketing) rural
credit, 19% for agro-industrial investment credit supplied by BNDES, and
the complete elimination of the Government's discount facility for
supplying subsidized agro-industrial credit. The Government's own resource
contributions to long- and short-term official rural credit in 1990



compared to 1987 are planned to be cut by 80% and 15Z, respectively.  This
program will be updated annually, with a view to achieving deeper cuts, and
is intended to become a three-year rolling plan, with the final objective
of limiting official credit only to those special cases where credit
subsidies can be wvll justified and targeted. Purthermore, in its efforts
to exercise greater control over the supply of official credit, the
Government recently enacted a decree which transfers the management of all
official credit lines to the Treasury (STN). In addition, all such credit
lines will now be included in the Government's fiscal budget -- a measure
aimed in part at more effectively controlling, ad well as increasing, the
transparency of credit subsidies.
4.       Rationale for Bank Involvement.  The Bank's overall strategy in
Brazil is to support macroeconomic adjustments that contribute to
sustainable economic growth. An important element in that strategy is the
reduction of the fiscal deficit, which is needed to control inflation,
restore business confidence and provide a generally favorable investment
climate. The proposed project, which is aimed at transferring dependence
from the official (interest rate-controlled) credit system to voluntary
commercial lending in the agricultural sector, should contribute
significantly to reducing the fiscal deficit as well as to improving the
efficiency of investment decisions. The Bank's involvement in this process
is crucial, both from the standpoint of supplying long-term commercial
credit during the present difficult period when private term finance
(whether domestic or external) is not available, and in providing the
support needed by Government to maintain its program for permanently
contracting the supply of official credit.
5.       Since the first agro-industrial credit project was approved in
1973, the Bank has made three agro-industrial credit loans totaling US$504
million. The third loan for US$400 million, which was approved in 1983, is
now almost totally committed and is expected to close on schedule at the
end of 1988. Over the years, steady progress has been made in these
projects towards making Bank funds available in Brazil on totally
commercial terms. In the proposed project, this progression towards
commercial lending of Bank funds would be completed in full, while the
Government contracts the official credit system in the agricultural sector.
6.       A proposed credit operation for farmers (the Agricultural Credit
Project) has been prepared in parallel with the proposed project. 'While the
Bank's objective is to move as quickly as possible to a single credit line
for the entire agricultural sector, at this stage, two lines of credit,
which is already a substantial improvement over past practice, is judged to
be necessary in view of the politically more sensitive nature of farm
credit. Historically, farm credit in Brazil has been a subsidized
activity, supported by strong political constituencies. If the farm credit
line were combined with the agro-industry line at this stage, it might
subject the latter to the same political risks. However, after these two
projects, in which the advantages of relying on commercial credit have been
demonstrated and supporting constituencies created, all future Bank
assistance for credit in the agricultural sector is envisaged to be
channeled through a single agricultural credit line. Together the proposed
project, and the Agricultural Credit Project represent an important part of
Brazil's attempt to reform its financial sector, an endeavor in which the
Bank is integrally involved.

7.       Project Objectives.  The main objectives of the project are to
promote productive agro-industrial investments and contribute to the
liberalization of agricultural credit by facilitating the expansion of
commercial credit and the simultaneous contraction of official credit.
8.       Project Description.  Bank loan funds would be used by the
Government to refinance subloans made by accredited participating banks
(PBs) to agro-industrial enterprises to finance their fixed investment and
associated working capital requirements. The refinancing terms have been
designed to enable the Government to recover from the PBs the full costs,
including foreign exchange risks, of the Bank loan, plus the administrative
costs. The onlending terms to final subborrowers would be a market outcome
as these would be the result of negotiations between the PBs and their
customers. All banks in Brazil which are accredited by the Central Bank
(CB) as being financially sound and having satisfactory loan appraisal/
management capability would be eligible to participate. The Bank's funds
would finance up to 50Z of subproject investment and associated working
capital costs, with the balance being negotiated between the PB and the
subborrower. Hence, no Government counterpart funds would be needed. With
a Bank loan of US$300 million, the total cost of the project would be
US$600 million. Project costs and the financing plan are shown in
Schedule A.
9.       The demand for agmr-industrial investment credit is potentially
very large. A review of the pipelines of only four major banks, undertaken
by the CB at the request of the Bank, revealed an agro-industrial
investment demand of over US$1 billion equivalent that would appear to be
eligible for financing under the project. In addition, surveys of
pro.pective investors conducted by Bank staff in late 1987 and early 1988
indicate that there is considerable interest in the proposed credit line.
10.      Loan funds are expected to be disbursed over a four-year project
implementation period. Amounts and methods of procurement and of
disbursements, and the disbursement schedule are shown in Schedule B. The
principal and perhaps most important coordination and management functions
would be performed by the PBs, which would review and approve subloan
applications and monitor investment and repayment performance after the
subloans are given. The Treasury (STN) would manage the refinancing of
subloans and be responsible for monitoring overall project performance,
reporting progress to the Bank, answering queries from interested parties
in Brazil and generally solving problems and removing bottlenecks should
they arise. A timetable of key project processing events and the status of
Bank Group operations in Brazil are given in Schedules C and D,
respectively. The Staff Appraisal Report, No. 7200-BR, dated May 23, 1988
is attached.
11.      Agreed Actions.  During negotiations, assurances were obtained on
the following actions: (a) the Government would prepare and submit to the
Bank quarterly reports on the status of implementation of its program to
contract official credit to the agricultural sector, including agro-
industries, and m.eet with the Bank on an annual basis to review and update
this program; (b) the CB would accredit PBs on the basis of agreed criteria
with respect to financial soundness and loan appraisal/management



-4-
capability; (c) below a free limit of US$5.0 million, PBs would be solely
responsible for approving subloans for refinancing; subloans at or above
that limit would require the approval of the Bank; (d) refinancing terms
would be set in order to enable the Government to recover from the PBs the
full costs of the Bank loan, plus administrative costs; and (e) agreed
internal procedures for disbursing credit funds to PBs and for repaying the
Government would be adopted.
12.      Benefits.  The major benefits that would derive from the project
are the reduced fiscal burden and improved efficiency in resource
allocation resulting from the liberalization of credit as well as the
additional income and employment growth in the agro-industrial sector and
the stimulus this would provide for primary agricultural production.
13.      Risks.  The main risk to the project is a further erosion of
investor confidence due to uncertainty in the economic environment. Should
this happen, credit uptake, hence disbursements, would be slowor than
estimated. However, recent Government commitments to reducing the fiscal
deficit in its efforts to stabilize the economy and the renewed dialogue
with the IMF are encouraging developments. Another risk is the resurgence
of official credit which could also reduce the demand for the project's
tommercial credit funds; however, the Government is committed to reducing
the supply of official credit and has begun to implement a program aimed at
contracting the supply of official credit to the agricultural sector. This
program would be carefully monitored and the Bank would meet with the
Government on an annual basis to review and update the program (para. 3).
14.      Recommendation.  I am satisfied that the proposed loan would
comply with the Articles of Agreement of the Bank and recommend that the
Executive Directors approve the proposed loan.

Procurement and Disbursements
Procurements The range of good.t to be financed under the project would be
varied. Vehicles and computers, Wding reserve procurement, would be
excluded from Bank financing. In the case of most subprojects, the items
to be financed under the project would not be suitable for bulk
procurement. Accordingly, procurement for most subprojects would be in
accordance with etandard practice for loans of this type and would follow
the normal commercial practice of private sector enterprises -- the
ultimate berificiaries of the proposed loan. The Brazilian construction
and capital goods industries are highly developed, and there is a
*ignificant foreign participation in these industries. A small minority of,
subprojects would be likely to involve substantial investment. Thus,
international competitive bidding procedures would apply in the case of
contracts of US$5 million or more. Brazilian contractors and suppliers
would receive a 152 preference over foreign suppliers.
