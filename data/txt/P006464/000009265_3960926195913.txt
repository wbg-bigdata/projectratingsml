BRAZIL
FOURTH AGRO-INDUSTRIES CREDIT PROJECT
I. LOAN AND PROJECT SUMMARY
Borrower:          The Federative Republic of Brazil.
Beneficiaries:     Accredited participating banks.
Loan Amounts       US$300 million equivalent.
Termss             Repayable in 15 years on a fixed amortization schedule,
including 5 years of grace, at the Bank's standard
variable interest rate.
Onlending Terms:   The terms of onlending between the Government and the
participating banks (PBs) have been designed to enable
the Government to recover from the PBs the full costs,
including foreign exchange risks, of the Bank loan plus
the administrative costs. The onlending terms to final
subborrowcrs would be a market outcome as these would be
the result of negotiations between the PBs and their
customers.
Proiect
Obiectives:         To facilitate an expansion of commercial (0nsubsidized)
term credit to finance productive agro-industrial
investments and, at the same time, enable the Government
to contract the supply of official (interest rate-
controlled) credit which is exacting a heavy fiscal toll
on the Government.
Proiect
Description:       Bank loan funds would be used by the Treasury (STN) to
refinance (discount) subloans given by participating
banks (PBs) to agro-industrial enterprises to finance
their fixed investment and associated working capital
requirements. All banks in Brazil which are accredited
by the Central Bank (CB) as being financially sound and
having the appropriate loan appraisal/management
capability would be eligible to participate.  World Bank
funds would finance up to 5O0  of subproject investment
and associated working capital costs; PBs and
subborrowers would finance the balance, with their
respective shares being negotiated between them.



-2-
Risks:             The main risk to the project is a further erosion of
investor confidence due to uncertainty in the economic
environment. Should this happen, credit uptake, hence,
disbursements, would be slower than estimated. However,
recent Government commitments to reducing the fiscal
deficit and the renewed dialogue with the IMF are
encouraging signs. Another risk is the resurgence of
official (subsidized) credit which could also reduce the
demand for the project's comercial credit funds;
however, the Government is committed to reducing the
supply of official credit and has begun to implement a
program to contract the supply of official credit to the
agricultural sector -- a program that will be regularly
monitored and reviewed annually with the Bank.

U1. THE SECTOR CONTEXT
A. Agriculture in the Economy
2.01     During the 1970s the total area planted to crops in Brazil rose at
3.3Z per year and sectoral GDP grew at an annual average rate of 62. This
high growth rate was fueled primarily by the development of export crops
(soybeans, citrus, tobacco, coffee and cocoa) and, 4n the latter part of
the decade, by sugarcane production for the alcohol program. Total
agricultural exports rose from US$2.09 billion in 1970 to US$9.43 billion
in 1980. Production was particularly dynamic in the expanding frontier
states of the Center-West (Goias, Hato Grosso do Sul and parts of Minas
Gerais) but also grew steadily in the traditional agricultural states of
the South.
2.02     After 1980, the sector entered a period of relative stagnation and
slow growth, caused in part by sector-specif.ic Government intervention
(trade and price controls), overall macroeconomic management difficulties
and by falling world commodity prices. The total area planted to crops in
Brazil grew at only 1.72 per year between 1980 and 1986 (compared to 3.3Z
in the previous decade), and the output of many basic food crops (wheat,
maize, cassava, potatoes, rice, beans, meat and milk) remained relatively
constant and rose only modestly in 1984 and 1985, with the result that per
capita food production declined significantly and food imports increased.
Agricultural exports exhibited a similar pattern, with virtually little or
no growth since 1980, except in 1984 when coffee and orange juice were
aided by favorable price movements. In 1987, rising domestic agricultural
prices, coupled with favorable weather conditions, contributed to a record
grain harvest of 65 million mt. Presently agriculture accounts for about
122 of GDP, 302 of employment and 33Z of exports.
B. Agro-Industry
2.03     Agro-industrial enterprises play an important role in the
Brazilian economy, accounting for about 50X of the total industrial
establishments in the country and 312 of the labor employed in the
manufacturing sector (Annex 1, Table 1). These enterprises also account
for about 262 of the total value addled by the manufacturing sector.  To
support these enterprises, Brazil has advanced engineering and construction
industries and an extensive commercial banking system. In recent years,
several agro-industries, including soybean products, orange juice and
poultry, have demonstrated their ability to compete in world narkets.
2.04     Agro-industry in brazil may be divided into the following major
categories: food processing, beverages, textiles, timber, paper and
cardboard, natural rubber, leather and tobacco, of which food processing
clearly dominates, accounting for about 59Z of the total number of
establishments and about 39Z of the total value added (Annex 1, Table 2);
most of the food processing establishments are small to medium in size. In
general, the geographical distribution of agro-industries conforms closely
to the location of primary agricultural production, with the Southeast
accounting for 552 of the total number of agro-industrial establishments,



-4-
the South approximately 232, the Northeast 182, the North 32, and the
Center-West 12 (Annex 1, Table 3).
2.05     The value of agro-industrial production in real terms over the
first half of the 19709 grew at an annual rate of about 142. Since the
mid-70s that growth has slowed to arou.nd 72 (Annex 1, Table 3). This
growth pattern generally reflects the overall performance of the economy,
and of the agricultural (paras. 2.01 and 2.02) and manufacturing sectors
during this period. Export earnings from agro-industry throughout the
first half of the 1980s have remained fairly constant, both in absolute
terms and as a percentage of total Brazilian exports (about 50x) (Annex 1,
Table 4).
C. Banking and Credit
2.06     Brazil has an extensive and well developed banking system.  There
are about 100 banks in Brazil, of which about 80 are private and 20 are
owned by the federal and state governments. Supervision of the banking
system is the responsibility of the Central Bank (CB). The CB has improved
the quality of its supervisory work in the last several years by focusing
attention on the overall solvency positions of the banks and not just on
their compliance with CB regulations. Further progress is needed, however,
in providing improved regulations for the classification of loans by
default risk, for the provision of potential loan losses and for the
treatment of interest accruals on doubtful loans. In addition, financially
troubled state banks often do not comply with CB regulations. These
weaknesses have been identified in the context of the Bank's current sector
work and are intended to be addressed in a proposed financial se'ctor
operation now under preparation.
2.07     All credit in Brazil is of two major typess *officials which is
interest rate-controlled and administratively allocated and, therefore,
subject to various political pressures; and *commercial* which is supplied
voluntarily at market determined rates. Official credit comprises nearly
902 of all rural credit to farmers. The principal sources of official
credit for industry, including agro-industries, have been: ti) the federal
development bank (BNDES), which supplies subsidized credit funds to
industry either directly or indirectly through other financial
intermediaries; and (ii) the discount facilities of the Central Bank (CB),
often with the assistance of bilateral and multilateral funds. In the case
of agriculture (i.e. farmers), the principal sources have been: (i)
Government funds channelled mainly through the federal commercial bank --
Bank of Brazil (BB); (ii) Central Bank discounts; (ili) the compulsory
application system in which commercial banks (federal, state and private)
are required to apply a fixed percentage of their sight (demand) deposits
to rural credit at subsidized (official) rates; and, (iv) more recently
(since 1987), the interest-bearing rural savings deposits held in BB and a
few other federal and regional banks. Under today's extremely uncertain
macroeconomic conditions, commercial term lending in Brazil for any
purpose, including agro-industry, has virtually disappeared. Consequently,
most medium- and long-term credit is being supplied by the official system.



-J.
2.08     The volume of official credit to the agricultural sector by source
for the last couple of years is shown in Annex 2, Table 1. Recent real
levels of official credit ha-i been relatively low (US$8.2 billion in 1987
-- a decrease of 412 in real terms compared to 1986), owing to the reduced
availability of funds (sight deposits) for compulsory applications and the
erosion of credit portfolios in the banks during most of 1986 and the early
part of 1987 when indexa'ion of financial assets was suspended for a short
time, and, after it was applied, fell well short of inflation. The
country's heavy dependence on official (interest rate-controlled) credit
has not only distorted resource allocation decisions and imposed a
significant fiscal burden on the Government,l but, contrary to stated
objectives, it has not benefitted the small borrowers.
2.09     Faced with major fiscal problems and unable to sustain large
credit subsidies, the Government is keenly interested in reducing this
burden and has indicated it would welcome Bank assistance at this time to
help liberalize credit markets in the agricultural sector, where credit
subsidies continue to exact a large fiscal toll on the Government. To this
end, the Government has requested Bank assistance in expanding the supply
of commercial credit to the agricultural sector (the proposed project being
a first step), while the Government does its part to reduce permanently the
supply of official credit to the sector. With regard to the contraction of.
official credit to the sector, the Government has begun to implement a
program which is detailed in Annex 2, Table 2.
2.10     As can be seen from Annex 2, Table 2, the Government's program to
contract official credit to the agricultural sector over the next three
years (1988-1990) represents a significant move in the right direction,
with cuts in real terms in 1990 (compared to 1987 -- an already relatively
low base year) reaching 22Z for long-term (investm'ent) sural credit, 122
for short-term (inputs and marketing) rural credit, 192 for agro-industrial
investment credit supplied by BNDES and the complete elimination of tne
Government's discount facility for supplying subsidized agro-industrial
credit.  The Government's own contributions to long- and short-term
official rural credit in 1990 compared to 1987 are planned to be cut by 80Z
and 152, respectively.  This program will be updated annually, with a view
to achieving deeper cuts, and is intended to become a three-year rolling
plan. Assurances were obtained at negotiations that the Economic
Secretariat of the Ministry of Finance (SEAE) would prepare and submit to
the Bank quarterly reports on the status of this program's implementation
and the Government would meet with the Bank each year to review and update
the program.
2.11     In its effort to exercise greater control over the supply of
official credit, the Government recently transferred the management of all
1/  In 1986 and 1987, the cost to the Government (calculated as the
difference between controlled interest rates and the yield on
Government Treasury bonds multiplied by the volume of official rural
credit supplied by the Government) is estimated to have been
approximately US$557 million and US$285 million, respectively. In 1986
these interest subsidies accounted for about 62 of the fiscal deficit.
Furthermore, the official credit resources channelled through the
Government-owned banks are not being recovered by the Treasury.



-6-
official credit lines to the Treasury (STN), including those previously
administered by the Central Bank (CB). The newly established Credit Limit
Committee (CLC), comprised of a representative from the CB, STN and SEAE,
now makes all credit allocation decisions for official credit currently
administered by STN. In addition, all such credit lines will now be
included in the Government's fiscal budget instead of the monetary bud6et
as was the practice in the past -- a measure aimed in part at more
effectively controlling, as well as increasing the transparency of credit
subsidies.
D. Agro-Industrial Credit Demand
2.12     The demand for agro-industrial investment credit is potentially
very large. A review of the pipelines of only four major banks, undertaken
by the CB at the request of the Bank, revealed an agro-industrial
investment demand of over US$1 billion equivalent that would appear to be
eligible for financing under the project. In addition, surveys of
prospective investors conducted by Bank staff in late 1987 and early 1988
indicate that ;here is considerable interest in the proposed credit line.
E. Experience with Bank Lending
2.13     To date, the Bank has made 47 loans totalling US$3,652 million for'
agricultural and rural development in Brazil. These loans includes two
sector operations -- the Agricultural Credit and Export Loan for US$303
million, approved in October 1983, and the Credit and Marketing Reform Loan
for US$500 million, approved in June 1986; supplemental financing of US$31
million under the Special Action Program; three loans totaling US$504
million for agro-industrial credit; three loans totaling US$112 million for
livestock; one loan for US$18 million for grain storage; two loans totaling
US$100 million for agricultural research; two loans totaling US$255 for
agricultural extension and training; one loan for US$100 million for land
tenure improvement; one loan for US$49 million for forestry development;
and 32 loans totalling US$1,681 million for various settlement, irrigation
and rural development projects.
2.14     The first of the three agro-industrial credit projects financed by
the Bank was approved in 1973. The third loan (Loan 2268-BR) for
US$400 million, which was approved in 1983, is now almost fully committed
and is expected to close on schedule at the end of 1988. Over the years,
these projects have expanded the range and variety of the activities
financed as well as the types of financing available. In the third loan,
financing has covered a wide range of activities including: primary
processing of foodstuffs such as soybeans, oranges, meat, fish and poultry,
as well as hides and fibers such as cotton; vertically integrated
operations, extending back to primary production or forward to secondary
processing (e.g., textiles, margarine and soap); the production of
agricultural inputs such as fertilizers and implements; and storage
facilities, packaging materials and other marketing operations.
2.15     With respect to the terms of financing in these agro-industrial
credit projects, there has been a steady progression towards commercial
lending. Under recent amendments to the Third Agro-Industries loan, the
full cost of the Bank loan, with the exception of the foreign exchange risk



-7-
and the commitment fee, which are borne by the Government, are being passed
on to the participating banks and, through them, ultimately to the final
subborrowers. Under the proposed project, the progression towards
commercial lending terms would be fully completed.
III. THE PROJECT
A.  Origin and Rationale for Bank Involvement
3.01     The proposed project originated with the approaching full
commitment of Loan 2268-BR (Third Agro-Industries Credit Project) and with
the continuing demand from agro-industrial enterprises for investment
finance. Such term finance has virtually disappeared under the present
uncertain economic conditions. Term credit for industry, including agro-
industry, is being supplied largely through the official system in which
interest rates are controlled and credit is administratively allocated
(para. 2.07). This dependence on official subsidized credit results in
large distortions in credit (investment) allocation decisions, a heavy
fiscal drain on Government and highly regrecsive income distributional
effects.
3.02     The proposed project is an integral part of a strategy aimed at
transferring dependence from the official credit system to voluntary
commercial lending in the agricultural sector. The Bank's involvement in
this process is essential, both from the standpoint of supplying long-term
commercial credit during the present difficult period when private term
finance (whether dome.stic or external) is not available, and in providing
the support needed by Government to prepare and implement a program for
permanently contracting the supply of official credit (para. 2.10).
3.03     While the proposed line of credit is reserved for agro-industries
and in another proposed credit operation (the Agricultural Credit Project),
the line of credit is reserved for farmers, the Bank's objective is to move
as quickly as possible to a single line of credit for the entire
agricultural sector. The intention is to approach this objective in a
series of discrete steps -- the first step being to consolidate all Bank
support for agricultural credit into only two credit lines -- one for
farmers and one for agro-industries and to discontinue the practice of
financing a multiplicity of credit lines through credit components in
larger projects in which credit is earmarked for specific investment
purposes (e.g. irrigation), or for particular farmers (e.g. as in the
region-specific rural development projects). At this stage, two lines of
credit, which is alrehdy a sabstantial improvement over past practice, is
judged to be preferakle to one in view of the politically more sensitive
nature of farm credit. Historically, farm credit in Brazil has been seen
as a subsidized activity, a position supported by strong political
constituencies. Consequently, introducing a commercial credit line for
farmers is a major political as well as economic reform which, if combined
with the agro-industry line at this stage, might subject the latter to the
same political risks. However, after these two projects, in which the
advantages of relying on commercial credit have been demonstrated and
supporting constituencies created, all future Bank assistance for credit in
the agricultural sector is envisaged to be channeled through a single
credit line.



-8-
B. Project Objectives
3.04     The main objectives of the project ire to facilitate an expansion
of commercial (unsubsidized) term credit to finance productive agro-
industrial investments and, at the same time, enable the Government to
contract the supply of official (interest rate-controlled) credit.
C.  Sumnary Description
3.05     Bank loan funds would be used by the Government to refinance
subloans made by accredited participating banks to &gro-industrial
enterprises to finance the latter's investment and associated working
capital requirements. The terms on which the Treasury (STN) of the
Ministry of Finance would refinance these subloans would be designed to
enable the Government to recover from the participating banks (PBs) the
full costs of obtaining and administering the Bank loan. The terms on
which the PBs would lend to their customers would be a market outcome and,
therefore, based essentially on the PB's refinancing costs plus a spread as
determined by the market.
D. Detailed Features
1. Accrediting Participating Banks
3.06     All banks in Brazil would be eligible to apply to participate in
the proposed program,, but only those which are accredited would, in fact,
qualify to participate. This accreditation procedure is of critical
importance because the PBs would perform the basic line management function
under the project (para. 3.21).   Accreditation, therefore, has been
designed to ensure that only those banks which are financially sound and
able to appraise agro-industrial subloans would participate. The CB would
be responsible for accrediting PBs under the project. Assurance was
obtained at negotiations that the CB, in accrediting the PBs, would apply
the following criteria:
(i)  the existing Operational Limits required by the CB covering debt
to equity ratios, exposure to individual loans and foreign debt
borrowing and lending (agreement was obtained at negotiations that
the Government would promptly notify the Bank of any change in the
Operational Limits);
(ii)  arrears as a percentage of the total outstanding loans would not
exceed 1OX, with arrears defined as either principal or interest
which is overdue for six months or more, including those overdue
payments that have either been capitalized, refinanced or rolled
over into a new loan; and
(iii) the number and qualifications of staff for appraising and managing
agro-industrial subloans would be judged satisfactory.



-.9-
2. EligibilitZ and Approval for Refinancing
3.07     The types of investment activity which would be eligible for
refinancing would includes
(i) any primary and subsequent transformation including storage,
cleaning, grading, processing and packaging of an agricultural raw
material from the time it is harvested until imuediately before
retail; and
(ii)   the manufacture of farm inputs, equipment and machinery, including
tools, silos, tractors and combines.
3.08     In addition, the working capital costs associated with the above
types of investment, up to 50? of the investment coct to be financed by the
Bank loan, would also be eligible for refinancing. Also a single
subborrcw#er would not be permitted to borrow in total more than 52 of the
Bank loan (i.e., not more than US$15 million). Assurance that all of the
above eligibility criteria would be followed was obtained during
negottations.
3.09     For subloans below prescribed free limits (US$5.0 million),
accredited PBs would have the sole right of approval. The PB would only
need to inform STN that the subloan has been made by submitting the
appropriate subloan documentation and, at the appropriate time, submit a
request for disbursement of the credit funds. Therefore, no agency in
Government would nee4 to exercise any discretionary authority in approving
subloans for refinancing. This is c)nsistent with one of the main
objectives of this operation which is to eliminate administrative
allocation decisions and to rely instead on the banks' and subborrowers'
willingness to pay market interest rates as the basis for determining who
does and does not receive credit. Second-guessing of the market result is
neither needed nor desirable. However, for those few subloans at or above
the free limit, the PB's, through STN, would submit proposals to the Bank
for approval. In addition, STH would send to the Bank for its review, the
documents on the first four subloans made. Assurances that the above
procedures would be followed were obtained during negotiations.
3. Refinancing Terms
3.10     The refinancing terms are the terms under which the Governnent
would refinance PB subloans. These terms have been designed to enable the
Government to recover from the PBs the full costs, including foreign
exchange risks, of the Bank loan, plus the administrative costs to the
Government.
3.11     Foreign Exchange Risk.  The easiest and most straightforward
method for treating the foreign exchange risk is to have the PBs assume
this risk in exactly the same form that the Government borrows from the
Bank. Under the Bank's currency pooling system, IBRD borrowers like Brazil
receive loans denominated in a basket of currencies which the Bank uses for
disbursement purposes. Variations in the value of the basket (which
depends on relative changes in the value of the different currencies in the
basket and on the currency -nmposition of the basket) are then used to



-10-
adjust the outstanding principal owed the Bank by the borrower. Hence,
IBRD bcrrowers assume a cross-currency, as opposed to a single exchange
rate risk. This system has definite advantages for IBRD borrowers, but it
also, at the same time, poses difficulties in passing this foreign exchange
risk on to financial intermediaries and ultimately to final subborrowers.
If the cross-currency or basket risk is included in the refinancing terms,
some subborrowers, particularly the smaller and financially less
sophisticated ones, may be discouraged from borrowing.
3.12     Generally PBs and their customers will incur risk in a form in
which they are reasonably familiar and against which they believe they can
hedge. Therefore, in order to make the proposed credit line as marketable
a product as possible, a few alternative options for denominating the
refinancing terms have been developed. Each option has been designed to
yield approximately the same cost (in present value terms over the life of
the average subloan) as the basket option. The PBs would be given the
choice of denominating their refinancing terms in one of the following
three forms:
(1)   in the Bank's basket of currencies, in whi-!h case the PB would
take the foreign exchange risk in exactly the same form that the
Government does, and the apolicable interest rate would be the
six-month adjustable interest rate the Bank charges IBRD borrowers
(currently 7.72X); or
(ii)   in US$, thus taking the Cz$-US$ exchange rate risk as compared to
the basket or cross-currency risk in (i) above, in which case the
interest rate in (i) above would be adjusted either upward or
downward to compensate for the difference in foreign exchange risk
between these two options; the differential between the weighted
average market yield on Bank bonds denominated in the currencies
of the basket and the market yield of US$ Bank bonds (based on
publicly traded bonds with a remaining maturity of 5 to 10 years)
would be used to reflect the difference in risk and added to or
subtracted from the interest rate in (i) above; for the
calculation of the weighted average market yield on the basket,
bonds denominated in five currencies (the US Dollar, Deutsche
Mark, Swiss Franc, Japanese Yen and Netherlands Guilder) would be
used, as these currencies comprise over 901 of the Bank's currency
pool; the proportions that these currencies represent in this
subset of the Bank's total pool would be used to weight the
respective yields; (applying the above methodology at today's
yields results in approximately a 3 percentage point premium which
would need to be added to the basket interest rate); the frequency
of interest rate adjustments would be the same as in (i) above;
and
(iii)   in cruzados, with the principal adjusted in accordance with the
National Treasury Bond (OTN) index,2 in which case the applicable
interest rate would be as in (ii) above, plus not less than 0.8
percentage points and not more than 2.5 percentage points
2/ The National Treasury Bond index is used for the purpose of indexing
financial contracts to take account of inflation.



depending on the difference by which depreciation of the cruzado
vis-a-vis the dollar exceeds changes in OTN over the preceding six
months; this adjustment is to offset the higher risk in option
(ii) that dollar/cruzado exchange rate adjustments will exceed
inflation as reflected in the OTN index (historically, over the
medium- and long-term, exchange rate adjustments have exceeded the
rate of inflation by about 2Z per annum on average).
3.13     In order to launch the proposed credit line in Brazil, the first
year of the project would be treated as a promotional period during which
the interest rate at which the Government would onlend funds to the PBs
would be somewhat lower than that prescribed by the above methodology.
Specifically, during the first year the premium to be added to the basket
interest rate in order to obtain the dollar interest rate would be set at
1.5 percentage points. After the first year the methodology described in
para. 3.11 (ii) above would be applied in full.
3.14     The other refinancing terms for the PBs would include:
(i)   0.25 percentage points interest annually to cover the costs to the
Government of administering the Bank loan;
(ii)   0.25 percentage points interest annually to cover the average
costs of the commitment fee which the Government pays on the
undisbursed balance of the Bank loan; and
(iii)   grace and anmortization periods which would be the same as those
adopted in the subloans, with a maximum term and grace period of
12 and 3 years, respectively.
3.15     If calculated today, based on the above terms, the interest rate
at which the Government would refinance (i.e. discount) PB subloans under
each of the three currency options (basket, dollar and OTN cruzado) would
be 8.22, 11.22 and 12Z, respectively, with the dollar and cruzado interest
rates being discounted to 9.7Z and 10.5Z, respectively, during the first
year promotional period (para. 3.13). At negotiations, assurance was
obtained that the refinancing terms referred to in paras. 3.12 through 3.14
above would be followed. As previously mentioned (para. 3.05), the final
onlending terms to subborrowers are intended to recover the PB's cost of
borrowing funds and would be a market outcome based on the negotiations
between PBs and their customers.
4. Transmission and Repayment of Credit Funds
3.16     The process of channelling credit funds to subborrowers and making
loan repayments would work as follows:
(i)  after contracts between suppliers and subborrowers are signed, the
latter would request the PB to pay the supplier or himself
directly;
(il') the PB would then request reimbursement from STN; to affect this
disbursement, STN would authorize the CB to credit the reserve
account of the PB and transfer funds from the Special Account
(para. 3.26) to the Government's account;



L-
(iii) when repayment of the subloan is due, the subborrower would pay
the PB which would take its spread and repay the Government (in
accordance with the refinancing terms, paras. 3.12-3.14; the
repayment would be affected by STN authorizing the CB to debit the
PB's reserve account and correspondingly credit the Government's
account.
3.17     Assurance was obtained during negotiations that these internal
procedures for disbursing credit funds to PBs and for making loan
repayments would be followed.
E. Proiect Cost and Financing
3.18     Bank loan funds would be used by the Government to provide a
commercial credit line to PBs to refinance up to 502 of the investment and
associated working capital costs of each subproject approved for
refinancing; the balance would be freely negotiated between the PB and the
subborrower and could involve various possible combinations of PB,
subborrower and other (financial intermediary) finance; hence, no
Government counterpart funds would be needed, unlike in the past, when the
unavailability of such funds substantially delayed subloan approval.
Assurance that these financing arrangements would be followed was obtained
during negotiations. The project cost and financing plan are given in
Annex 3. Table 1 and summarized belowt
Table 1: Project Cost and Financina
JS$ million           I
Total Cost of Investments              600              100
Financed by:
Bank                                 300               50
PBs, other lending institutions
and Subborrowers                 300               50
3.19     Because of the range and variety of investments eligible for
project financing, the foreign exchange and tax components are impossible
to calculate with any degree of accuracy. It is, however, estimated that
the foreign exchange component is likely to be in the order of 10-151 of
the total costs (most machinery and equipment components are domestically
manufactured) and taxes to be about 5Z (tractors and agricultural equipment
are exempt from tax).
3.20     The borrower of the Bank loan would be the Government.  Although
the refinancing terms (paras. 3.10-3.14) have been designed to enable the
Government to recover from the PBs the full costs of the Bank loan, there
could be some discrepancies between the Bank's lending terms and the
refinancing terms with regard to the treatment of exchange risks (as PBs
have one of three options and although they may be equal over time, they do
have different cash flow characteristics), commitment fees (as the method
chosen is only an approximation of the cost to the Borrower) and graco and
amortization periods (as these will conform to the subloans). Implicit in
this formulation is the fact that the Borrower (i.e., the Government),
would account for any difference; however, these discrepancies are expected
to be small.



F. Coordination and Management
3.21     The principal and perhaps most important coordiration and
management functions would be performed by the PBs themselves. These are
the institutions which would review and approve subloan applications and
monitor investment and repayment performance after the subloans are given.
The experience of the Third Agro-Industry Credit Project indicates that the
banking system as a whole has the capability and expertise to do the job
well. To ensure that the individual banks which participate in this
program have this capability, each participating bank would need to be
accredited (para. 3.06j.
3.22     The CB, on behalf of the Government, would manage the Special
Account (para. 3.25) including the crediting and debiting of PB reserve
accounts (para. 3.16(ii) and (iii)). Within the CB this function would be
performed by the Department of International Organizations and Agreements
(DEORI). Information needed for the accreditation of PBs would be
maintained by the CB's Department of Banking (DEFIB) which would make this
information available to the CB's Department of Industrial Credit and
Special Programs (DESE) which, based on the agreed criteria, would be
responsible for actually accrediting PBs under the project.  In addition,
DESPE would coordinate all of the activities to be performed by the
different CB departments under the project and would be responsible for
communicating directly with PBs, including informing them every six months
of changes in the cost of refinancing (interest rates and outstanding
principal) based on the different refinancing options (para. 3.12).
3.23     In addition to authorizing the CB to credit and debit PB reserve
accounts, STN would be responsible for monitoring overall project
performance (para. 3.27), reporting progress to the Bank (paras. 3.27 and
3.28), answering queries from actual and prospective PBs and subborrowers,
and generally solving problems and removing any bottlenecks should they
arise. The unit in STN recently set up to administer all official credit
lines (para. 2.11) would carry out the above functions for the project. At
present this unit comprises 20 staff, 12 of whom were recently transferred
from the CB. A computer program linking STN with the CB and the banks
would be used to affect all official credit transactions, including those
under the project. Assurance was obtained at negotiations that STN would
carry out supervision of the project, in a manner satisfactory to the Bank,
with management and staff adequate in numbers, qualifications and
experience and utilizing appropriate financial control systems.
G. Procurement
3.24     The range of goods to be financed under the project would be
varied. Vehicles and computers, being reserve procurement, would be
excluded from Bank financing. In the case of most subprojects, the items
to be financed under the project would not be suitable for bulk
procurement. Accordingly, procurement for most subprojects would be in
accordance with standard practice for loans of this type and would follow
the normal commercial practice of private sector enterprises -- the
beneficiaries of the proposed loan. The Brazilian construction and capital
goods industries are highly developed, and there is a significant foreign



-14-
participation in these industries.  A small minority of subprojects would
be likely to involve substantial investment.  Thus, international
competitive bidding procedures would apply in the case of contracts of US$5
million or more.  Brazilian contractors and suppliers would receive a 15Z
preference over foreign suppliers.  During negotiations, the Government
provided assurance that the above procurement procedures would be followed.
H. Disbursements
3.25     To facilitate Bank disbursements, a Special Account would be
opened in US dollars in the CB and operated under the same general
procedures applicable to other special accounts in the CB.  The Special
Account would be opened with an initial deposit of US$30 million.  Similar
accounts have been established under a number of previous Bank loans in
Brazil and are working satisfactorily. The advances would be used to
finance only the Bank's share of the project costs. The proceeds of the
proposed loan wonld be disbursed to the PBs on the basis of 1002 of the
amount disbursed for subloans (which would be up to 502 of the total
subproject costs) and would be made against statements of expenditure
(SOE). The documents in support of these SOEs would be retained by the CB
and made available for inspection by the Bank during project supervision
missions and would be subject to annual independent audit (paras. 3.30 aBd
3.31). During negotiations, the Government provided assurances on these
disbursement matters. In addition, receipt by the Bank of the signed
refinancing agreement between the PB and the Government and the approval of
the Bark for subloans at or above the free limit (para. 3.09) would be
conditions of disbursement.
3.26     Consistent with the disbursement profile for the Third Agro-
Industrial Credit Project, disbursements from the proposed Bank loan are
estimated to take place over a four-year project implementation period and
would be as follows:
Table 2:  Disbursements
(US$ Million)
FY89        FY90        FY91       FY92
Annual              60          75         80          85
Cumulative          60        135         215         300
The estimated project completion date would be June 30, 1992.
I. Monitoring and Reporting
3.27     Monitoring and reporting on the overall program of financing would
be the responsibility of STN; the progress of individual subprojects would
be the responsibility of the PBs. Each month STN would submit to the Bank
a summary report based on information provided by the PBs setting forth for
each PB: (a) the number and principal amounts outstanding of new subloans;
and (b) the total amount disbursed to, and repaid by, each PB during the
relevant month.
3.28     Each quarter, the PBs would submit to STN a summary of the
progress made in making subloans, including information by subloan



regarding the number and principal amounts outstanding and disbursements
to, and repayments made by subborrowers, classified by region and state and
by type of activity and investment financed. STN would submit a summary of
these reports to the Bank. On completion of the project, STN would prepare
a completion report.
3.29     During negotiations, the Government provided assurances on the
monitoring and reporting arrangements described above.
J. Auditing
3.30     The CB, on behalf of the Government, would maintain the Special
Account, which would be audited annually by independent auditors acceptable
to the Bank. After the audit and not later than six months after the close
of its fiscal year, STN would transmit to the Bank certified copies of
these audited accounts, together with a certified copy of the auditor's
report, which would include a description of the audit procedures followed.
3.31     The auditors would, during the course of their annual audits,
carry out such test checks as were, in their professional judgement,
required of the internal controls over project transactions and of the
implementation of these controls. The test checks would specifically
include the preparation of statements of expenditure supporting
disbursement requests from the PBs and would confirm that the expenditures
at the subborrower level have been made for the stated purpose.  The
auditors would include in their long-form reports such comments or
observations as they judged necessary on project transactions.
3.32     During negotiations, the Government provided assurance on the
audit arrangements described above.
K. Environmental Impact
3.33     One of the major factors contributing to the degradation of the
environment is the divergence between the private costs perceived by
individuals and enterprises and the total social costs, including those to
the environment, associated with investment decisions. In Brazil, the
availability of highly subsidized credit has kept the private costs
associated with many investment decisions substantially below the social
costs, often contributing in pact to the excessive exploitation of natural
resources. This can be seen most graphically in the more ecologically
fragile parts of the country (e.g. Amazonas) where various incentive
schemes (tax shelters and cheap credit) have made otherwise unattractive
investments more promising and contributed to an unsustainable rate of
settlement. By helping to remove these credit subsidies in the
agricultural sector, the project is expected to contribute to greater
husbandry and efficiency in the use of the country's limited natural and
other resources.
3.34     The environmental impact of specific subprojects financed under
this operation would be subject to evaluation by state-level environmental
authorities (SEPAs), which are responsible for the enforcement of national
and state environmental control legislation. The National Environmental



Agency (SEMA) provides technical backstopping to the SEPAs. Full
responsibility for such enforcement was decentralized to the SEPAs only in
1986, and in most states, they do not have the staff nor the technical
capacity to fully assume responsibility for effective environmental
protection. Also, the legislative and regulatory frameworks are deficient
in many states. Nevertheless, in the larger and more advanced states,
where most subprojects are likely to be located, there is adequate capacity
-- Sao Paulo, Rio de Janeiro and Parana all have well-staffed and
.;echnically competent SEPAs. In addition, under the Sao Paulo Second
Pollution Control Project, the Bank is financing programs to strengthen the
pollution control capacity of SEPAs in states other than Sao Paulo. This
reflects the Bank's strategy in Brazil of concentrating its efforts on
helping to build a Brazilian institutional and legal capacity to deal with
environmental problems. Under the proposed operation, however, the Bank
would itself be reviewing and approving all larger investment proposals
(subloans at or over $5 million) and would be in a position to identify
potential environmental issues and assure that they are referred to the
appropriate authorities.
L. Financial and Economic Benefits
3.35     While the investment decisions of individual entrepreneurs and
risk bearing financi&l intermediaries cannot be predicted, the economic
impact of the proposed loan is expected to be substantial. There would be
investments of some US$600 million in new plant and equipment, and on the
basis of experience with earlier projects, some 25,000--30,000 new jobs are
likely to be created.. Indirect benefits would accrue to agriculture from
an expanded market for its products and from the supply of improved inputs.
The rate of interest to be charged ensures the probability of obtaining
satisfactory financial rates of return on most subprojects. In addition,
the further liberalization of agricultural credit would contribute to
improved efficiency in resource allocation and reduce the Government's
fiscal burden.
M. Risks
3.36     The main risk to the project is a further erosion of investor
confidence due to uncertainty in the economic environment. Should this
happen, credit uptake, hence, loan disbursements, would be slower than
estimated. However, recent Government commitments to reducing the fiscal
deficit in its efforts to stabilize the economy and the renewed dialogue
with the IMF are encouraging developments. Another risk is the resurgence
of official credit which could also reduce the demand for the project's
commercial credit funds; however, the Government is committed to reducing
the supply of official credit and has begun to implement a program aimed at
contracting the supply of official credit to the agricultural sector. This
program would be carefully monitored and the Bank would meet with the
Government on an annual basis to review and update the program (para.
2.10).



-17-
IV. Summary of Agreements and Recommendations
4.01     During negotiations, assurances from Government would be sought
thats
(a) SEAE would prepare and suLnit to the Bank quarterly reports on the
status of implementation of the Government's program to contract
official credit to the agricultural sector, and the Government
would meet with the Bank on an annual basis to review and update
this program (para. 2.10);
(b) participating banks would be accredited by the CB according to
agreed criteria concerning financial soundness and loan appraisal
capability (para. 3.06);
(c) refinancing of subloans would be confined to eligible types of
investment activity and associated working capital costs
(paras. 3.07-3.08);
(d) a single subborrower would not be able to borrow in total more
than 5Z of the Bank loan (para. 3.08);
(e) for subloans below the free limit of US$5.0 million, accredited
PBs would have the sole right of approval and for subloans at or
above the free limit, the PBs. through STN, would submit them to
the Bank for approval (para. 3.09);
Cf) the refinancing terms described in paras. 3.12 through 3.14
would be followed (para. 3.15);
tg) the internal procedures for disbursing the credit funds to PBs and
for making loan repayments to the Government as described in
para. 3.16 would be followed (para. 3.17);
th) the proceeds of the Bank loan would be used to refinance up to 502
of the investment and associated working capital costs of a
subproject (para. 3.18);
(i) STN would carry out supervision of the project, in a manner
satisfactory to the Bank, with management and staff adequate in
numbers, qualifications and experience and utilizing appropriate
financial control systems (para. 3.23);
(j) procurement arrangements outlined in para. 3.24, including the use
of ICB in the case of contracts of US$5 million or more, would be
followed;
(k) suitable arrangements would be made f!r the establishment and
operation of a Special Account in the CB (para. 3.25);



(1) STN would prepare and submit to the Bank monthly (para. 3.27) and
quarterly (para. 3.28) progress reports (para. 3.29); and
(m) the audit arrangements described in paras. 3.30 and 3.31 would be
followed (para. 3.32).
4.02     Receipt by the Bank of the signed refinancing agreement between
the PB and the Government and the approval of the Bank for subloans at or
above the free limit would be conditions of disbursement (para. 3.25).
4.03     With the above assurances and conditions, the proposed project
would be suitable for a Bank loan of US$300 million equivalent at the
standard variable rate, with a term of 15 years, including a 5-year grace
period.
