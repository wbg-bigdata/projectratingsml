INTERNATIONAL BANK FOR RECONSTRUCTION AND DEVELOPENT
REPORT AND RECOQMMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT TO THE EXECUTIVE
DRECTORS ON A PFOPOSED LOAN TO COMISION FEDERAL DE
ELECTRICIDAD (CFE) AND NACIONAL FINANCIERA, S.A.
WITH THE GUARANTEE OF THE UNITED MEXICAN STATES
FOR TH4E FOtlRTH POWER SECTOR PROGRAM
1.        I submit the following report and recommendation on a proposed
loan to Comision Federal de Electricidad (CFE) and Nacional Financiera,
S.A. with the guarantee of the United Mexican States for the equivalent
of $125 million, to help finance the continuing expansion program of the
power sector of Mexico. The loan would have a term of 20 years including
five years of grace, with interest at 7-1/h percent per-annum.
PART I - BANK LENDING TO MEXICO
2.        My report and recommendation (P-1036) dated April 19, 1972,
which was distributed in connection with a proposed B;;nk loan for a ports
project, gave recent information on the Mexican economy and its prospects
(for the relevant sections of that report, see Annex II). As of April 30,
1972 the Bank had made 26 loans to Mexico totalling $1,074 million net
of cancellations, of which the Bank held $839 million including $157 mil-
lion not yet disbursed. In the meantime the ports, railway and industrial
fund loans have been approved aggregating $130 million.   A suwmary of Bank
loans and IFC investments and a report on project execution is attached
as Annex I. Country data are at Annex II.
PART II - THE PROJECT
Background
3.        From 1965 to date the Bank has made three loans totalling
$325 million to help finance the programs of the entire power sector,
having previously made seven loans from 1949 to 1962 totalling $255 mil-
lion, net of cancellations, to finance projects of the two main power
companies. The sector programs have included the installation of new
generating, transmission and distribution facilities under a long range
expansion plan, which is reviewed-periodically by the Bank and SOFRELEC,
one of CFE's consultants.



-2-
The 1972-74 Program
4.        The fourth power sector project follows the general pattern of
the three previous sector projects in that it consists of the investment
program expected to be carried out over a specific period, in this case
the three years 1972-7T. The total cost of the 1972-74 investment program
is estimated at the equivalent of $1,368 million with a foreign exchange
cost of $650 million. Of the total some 60 percent is for generation,
transmission and substations, 23 percent for distribution, 6 percent for
village electrification, 8 percent for overhead and 3 percent for frequency
unification, consultants and miscellaneous. Major generation equipment
includes 3,015 MW of hydroplant, 3,900 MW of steam-turbine plant, 670 MW
of nuclear plant and 500 MW of gas-turbine plant. The transmission
program envisages the construction of 3,000 km of h00 IcV lines, 2,900 km
of 220 kV lines and 5,600 km of 69-161 kV lines; furthermore, 17,000 MVA
of main stations and 300 MVA of small substations will be constructed.
The distribution networks, including village electrification, will be
expanded at an annual cost of $120 million. Further details are shown in
Annex III.
5.        Investment in the power sector has been increasing rapidly in
recent years and is expected to continue to increase substantially to
assure the generation and distribution capacity necessary to meet
Mexico's rapidly growing power demand. Actual investment in 1970/71 was
35 percent higher than had been projected by CFE in 1969 because of
increasing prices in world markets and the need for major additions to
the program, particularly gas turbines, as a result of more rapid growth
of demand than had been expected, as well as delay in the implementation
of frequency unification, which is discussed in paragraph 18 below. The
annual investment now projected for 1972-74 is h0 percent higher at
current prices than the average for the past two years as a result of
the growing demand, the general increase in prices and the inclusion in
the program of Mexico's first nuclear plant, which has a relatively long
installation period.
Financing Plan
6.        The 3harp increase which has occurred in physical investment
and prices has led to much larger borrowing than had been expected; as
a result, debt service in 1971 absorbed the bulk of internal cash genera-
tion of the power sector plus contributions by the Government and power
users. In 1970-71 these resources financed only 12 percent of the
investment program instead of the 35.percent projected at the time of
appraisal; even though the sector has been earning the 8 percent return
on its assets required under the last loan. With tariffs remaining at
their present level practically all of the 1972-74 investment program
would have had to be financed from borrowing and the heavy debt burden
of the power sector would have been further increased.



-3-
7.        The Mexican Government has recognized that a substantial in-
crease in tariffs is essential for the sound financing of the fourth
power sector program and its Energy Policy Committee has recommended an
average tariff increase of 17-1/2 percent. A revision in the rate
structure providing for an average increase in excess of this percentage
has now been worked out by the Federal Electricity Commission and the
procedural steps required in Mexico to initiate power tariff changes are
now being taken. The revision provides for substantial increases in
rates charged industrial, commercial and larger residential users, with
reductions in those charged smaller consumers in line with the Government's
general aim. of reducing income inequalities in Mexico. Several months
will be required to take all of the steps needed to implement the rate
changes, which the Government plans to bring into effect before the end
of the current calendar year. This timing is part of a phased program
for increasing public enterprise tariffs, including those for petroleum
products and urban water supply without interfering with the recovery
of the economy from the industrial recession in 1971.
8.        To avoid delay the Government has requested that the Bank
proceed with the loan without waiting for the increase in power tariffs
on the understanding that the documentation necessary for loan effective-
ness will not be submitted until the tariffs have been raised. My
recommendation is that we proceed on this basis; a letter from the borrow-
ers and the guarantor incorporating the understanding would be signed
simultaneously with the loan documents. To help to assure on a continuing
basis the sound financing of the power sector the Guarantee Agreement
(in Section 3.03) specifies that net internal resources shall cover at
least 18 percent of investment expenditure in 1973 and 25 percent in 197h
and subsequent years.
9.        These understandings are reflected in the financing plan for
the 1972-74 con5truction program which is set out below. The borrowing
necessary to complete the plan is summarized in the following paragraphs.

Total Financing         1,368              100
Export Financing
10.       The financial plan for the fourth power sector program reflects
a transition from joint financing, used for the first three Mexico power
sector projects, to parallel financing. A total of $1L8 million of orders
qualified for joint financing under the third power sector program by
December 31, 1971, which was established as the cutoff date for such orders.
These orders are being covered on a 50-50 basis by the Bqnk and joint
loans from equipment-supplying countries; disbursements under the latter
are expected to total $68 million during 1972-74.
11.       The joint financing system has been based on the participation
of all developed countries supplying substantial amounts of electrical
equipment to Mexico and the shift now contemplated to parallel financing
was an outgrowth of a decision by the United States not to continue its
participation. CFE has selected a list of major equipment in the 1972-7h
program totalling about $120 million (Note: figure subject to revision)
to be reserved for competitive bidding among countries which are prepared
to provide parallel financing for orders won by their suppliers. In view



-5-
of the time needed to place orders and for delivery of equipment, disburse-
ments under the parallel loans are projected at about $50 million during
1972-74.
12.       The list of equipment for parallel financing excludes the steam
supply system for Mexico's first nuclear power plant. This sytem will
be financed through supplier credits under separate arrangements, since
the manufacturers of nuclear equipment are ready to offer financing with
terms of at least 15 years and at reasonable interest rates. In case
CFE decides to procure the turbogenerator separately, it would request
its inclusion in the part of the program to be financed by parallel loans.
The Proposed Bank Loan
13.       The proposed Bank loan would cover payments on the following
items:
$ Millions
Equipment eligible for Joint financing           35
Other equipment                                  73
Civil works (foreign exchange component          15
only)
Consultants                                       2
14.       Equipment to be financed under the Bank loan is being procured
through international competitive bidding with a maximum preferential
margin of 15 percent for Mexican firms. If orders are won by Mexican
firms the loan would finance the full ex-factory price. There are no
preferential tariffs affecting the goods tc be financed under the loan.
There would be a substantial amount of equipment in the program reserved
for procurement in Mexico, but this would not be financed by the Bank.
Civil works contracts with an estimated value greater than Mex$20 million
($1.6 million) would, as under the four previous power loans to Mexico,
be awarded on the basis of international competitive bidding.
15.       The term of the Bank loan would be 20 years following the
pattern of past power sector loans. However, the grace period lould be
five rather than four years in view of the heavy burden of debt service
on the power sector during the next five years.
Other Borrowing
16.       To complete'the financing required to carry out the 1972-7h
program, substantial amounts, in addition to the Bank loan and the export
credit financing described above, will have to be borrowed from commercial
banks and by bond issues and other means, both from within Mexico and
abroad. The scale of the borrowing required will decrease as internal
cash generation by the power sector increases after 1972. The proportion
of the construction program financed by borrowing of all kinds is expected to
decline from 94 percent in 1972 to 60 percent in 1976. Total debt service



-6-
coverage by internal cash generation is projected to increase from 0.9
times in 1972 to 1.L times in 1973. Since the interest coverage covenant
is not expected to be met through 1973, however, the Bank's consent would
be needed for borrowing to finance the construction program.
Sector Performance
17.       Performance of the power sector in recent years has been generally
satisfactory. Longer range planning of the sector's generation and trans-
mission facilities is called for, however, and the methods for putting this
into practice will be worked out during 1972-7l by CFE's planning department,
assisted by SOFRELEC, under terms of reference to be discussed with the Bank.
CFE has also undertaken to make further improvements in its load fore-
casting. A computerized control system for the sector's investment program
and budget will also be introduced,
18.        The major failure in performance during 1970/71 was in carrying
out the first phase of frequency unification to match the existing 50-
cycle Centro system with the 60-cycle system of the rest of Mexico, as
had been agreed in connection with Loan 659-ME and the two previous loans.
While various master plans have been prepared, no action has been taken,
mainly because of opposition'by the management of Centro and its labor
union. After a thorough review of the merits of frequency unification in
August 1971, President Echeverria signed the decree directing that a
program of frequency unification be formulated and completed by 1977.
The issue of a second decree creating the entity to 'carry out the conversion
was, however, delayed because it became bound up with highly controversial
Jurisdictional disputes involving the three labor unions in the power sector.
This jurisdictional problem has now been resolved and the second decree
was issued in May, which will enable work on frequency unification to
proceed without further delay.
Economic Evaluation
19.        The power sector project is well justified.  It is designed to
meet the power needs of Mexico's rapidly growing economy, as well as to
expand electrification in rural areas. In the annual reviews of
its program CFE studies all practical alternative methods of meeting
its peak load and energy requirements, subject to a minimum standard of
dependability.  The economic return on the 1972-7h time-slice of
investment is about 1 percent. The assumed benefits include bnly
directly attributable revenues. The full value of the economic return,
which would reflect the extent to which Mexican consumers would be prepared
to purchase more expensive privately generated power, would undoubtedly be
higher.

PART III - LEGAL INSTRUMENTS AND AUTHORITY
20.       The draft Loan Agreement between the Bank and Comision Federal
de Electricidad and Nacional Financiera, S.A., the draft Ouarantee
Agreement between United Mexican States and the Bank, the Report of the
Committee provided for in Article III, Section h(iii) of the Articles of
Agreement and the text of a Resolution approving the proposed Loan are
being distributed to the Executive Directors separately.
21.       I am satisfied that the proposed Loan would comply with the
Articles of Agreement of the Bank.
PART IV - RECOMMENDATION
22.       I recommend that the Executive Directors approve the proposed
Loan.

C.   FROJBCTS IN EXECUTION
Loan 659ME: Execution of Bank financed projects is on the -whole
satisfactory. Freouency unification, to be executed under a covenant
of Loan 65RiE has long been delayed. The Presidential decree establish-
ing the unit responsible for the frequency change in custaners' installa-
tions has been signed in May, 1972 and there does not arpear to be any
further obstacle for the implementation of the prcgrarl. The financial
position of the power sector is also a matter of concern. Under the fourth
power sector loan Mexico is undertaking to increase tariffs as a condition
for declaring the loan effective. With the proposed tariff increase the
power sector would again be able to contribute a significant portion to
the cost of plant expansion0
528I'E/695mE:  Minor delays have been occurring in disbursements of
the third and fourth road loans because of deceleration in awarding
contracts and presenting loan applications to the Bank.   Actior to improve
project executior is being discussed by a supervisidn mission that is
presently in the field.
45IE/527I'E: Construction under irrigation project loan $5CME

8.        iexico, with a GDP of around ;"35 billion a year, ranks closely
behind Brazil as the Bank, s second largest borrower in terms of loans
outstanding. Its economy is comparable in size to Brazil and larger than
that of any other country to which the Bank Group is lending except India.
Lexico bas been remarkably successful in sustaining a 6-7 percent annual
growth rate over a period of 15 years, with only a moderate increase in
the general price level. This achievement is attributable to a unique
combination of historical and geographical factors, intelligent economic
and financial policies (exhibiting a high degree of pragmati8m and freedom
from economic dogma) and a continuity in economDLc management unparalleled
elsewihere in Latin America. Taxation has been kept low (around 9 percent
of GDP), but private savings have been encouraged, and a considerable
proportion of these savings has been channelled into the public sector
tlrough the banking system. IF.ational savings have been maintained at
close to one-fifth of GDP, and although there has been a significant
increase in the external deficit on current account since 1968, this
still constitutes less than 3 percent of GDP.
9.        T'here is another side of the picture to which attention has
been drawn in my previous reports on Lexico. Of all countries in the
world *ith populations of comparable size, riexico has the fastest demogra-
phic gr-wth rate. `.hile per capita. income at current prices has risen
from i200-250 a year in the middle 1950's to about {700 a year today, the
increase in income has been very unevenly distributed. Wthile organized
workers and the graring middle class have shared in the benefits of
economic development and a few people have become yery rich, relatively
little has been done to alleviate rural poverty. Some 40 percent of the
population still depends on agriculture for a living, but agriculture
acccunts for only 11 or 12 percent of the national income. IJithin the
agricultural sector itself there is a sharp contrast between the prosper-
ous conditions of the larger private farms, particularly in the irrigated
north and along the coast of the Gulf of ijexico, and the desperate poverty
of the small farmers in the central plateau and along the central and south
Pacific Coast. glural education and health have not been given much at-
tention; and away from the main roads, communications in mDst parts of
the country are still quite primitive.
10.       The Administration of President Echeverria, dhich took office at
the end of 1970, has laid great stress on the need to improve the conditions
of the poor and .to correct inequalities in income. At the same. time, hot-
ever, the Government has beenlbroed to recognize the cmstraints imposed
on- the groath of the econory by the widening gap betw-een imports and ex-
ports and the increasing external debt which has kept the debt service
ratic above 20 percent in recent years. .irst priority has accordingly
been given to changes in economic-policy and improvements in economic
management required to maintain a satisfactory overall growth. As noted
in rW last report on iiexico, a series of newt tax measures tJas enacted in



Annex IV
Page 2
late 1970, sugar prices were increased, and steps were taken to strengthen
central control of public borrowirLg.  At the same time, nae emphasis was
given to export promotion, and a scheme uas introduced under which manu-
factured exports are entitled to tax rebates up to 10 percent of export
value. A second fiscal package tas adopted early this year, including
a nan tax on income from fixed-interest securities, an increase in mar-
ginal rates oI' personal income tax and tax incentives for industrial in-
vestment. There is also a nesw tax, equivalent to 5 percent of enter-
prise payrolls, the proceeds of which are to be used to finance workers'
housing through a 1lational Housing Fund. The two tax paclages together,
excluding the housing tax, are expected to increase, federal tax revenues
by about 10 percent and should raise the ratio of taxes to GDP by approxi-
mately one percentage point.
11.       Public investment w^xas deliberately held down in 1971 to protect
the balance of payments, and thia was one reason why the real grorth of
GDP slowed dowM to 3 or 4 percent, producing something of a recession from
uhich industry may now be slowly recovering. On the more positive side,
there appears to have been a net reduction in medium and long-term ex-
ternal public indebtedness during 1971, made possible in part by a small
improvement in the current balance of payments, but more importantly by
a large inflow of short-term funds. International reserves increased by
$200 million durin; the year and now stand at well over 4l billion.
12.       Iniproved extemal debt management has been reflected in the
terms on which the ;exican authorities borrowed in internatianal capital
marlke s during 1971. For example, loans xith maturities of 1 - 5 years,
which accounted for over 40 percent of total external public borrowing
in 1970, made up only 12 percent of such borrowzing during the first 9
months of last year. Ttio major operations concluded with consortia of
foreign banks for a total of j220 million carry final maturities of 8
and 10 years from signing, with a grace period of 4 years in each case.
The public issue of D.;100 million in Germany in . ovember 1971 had a term
of 15 years, including 5 years of grace. Another issue of 940 rmillion
MLarketed in i  Yew York a short time ago has a tem of 15 years. This im-
provement in the tenas of borrowinrg from private sources taill malce it
easier for .dxico to support a continued high rate of economic expansion
without endangering its credit standing abroad. There is, however, little
prospect of the country obtaininZ all the external capital it needs on
extended termis ithout substantial contributions from the IB3RD and the
IDB which are the only official lending agencies in a position to offer
development assistance on non-commercial terms.
13.       Public savihgs in idxico must'also be increased if expenditures
on rural development and social services are to be raised to more adequate
levels, and this has been a constant theme of the Baiik's economic reports.
As a result of the tax measures already described, there does appear to
have been same increase in federal government savings during 1971, and
the savings of the F"ederal District also improved slightly. On the other
hand, there. has been a decline in the total savings of the three major
public enterprises (the national petroleum company, the federal power com-
mi9sion and the railroads) from i,x;3 billion in 1970 to iexU2.1 billion
in 1971, and this trend needs to be reversed - a matter of special concern
to the Bank in vief of the proposed lbans for railrays and power.

14.       The primary objective of Bank lending to 1ieidco has always bemn
to support the growth of the economW by providing long-term capital for
projects that can both benefit from the Bank's special expertise and
promise high developmental returns. At the same time, in the case of
the power program and the steel project now under consideration, both of
ihichi have large import components, Bakc participation helps iXexico to
organize financing from other scurces on the basis of broad international
competitive bidding. The Bank has been associated with the powner sector
since 1941, and while the federal power commission, with the Bank's
encouragement, now looc0e to export credits to meet a significant propor-
tion of its external capital requirememts under joint or parallel fin-
ancing arrangeri,ents, the l.exican authorities attach great importance to
a continuation of Bank lending for power, particularly for financing
the forei&n exchange costs of civil uorl;s and equipment for transmission
and distribution. The iLexican Government has also sought the Bank's
financial and technical assistance for the development of the transport
sector, initially mainly for roads, but since the 1970 sector stucdr, for
ports and raiblays as well.
15.       PowJer and transport apart, the Bank is giving special emphasis
to projects uhich directly lhelp to strengthen the balance of payments,
since the balance of payments is liable to be'a critical constraint on
economic devalopmient in an economy tied to free convertibility of its
currency and heavily dependent at the margin on private capital inflow.
This ha3 been an important consideration in past lending for irrigation
(cottc,.,) and totxrism and in the lendin- now proposed for a new industrial
fund. Additionally, now that it is the declared policy of the 1Iexican
Government to give more attention to the quality of economic develop-
rient, especially in rural areas, the Dank is interested in giving izhat
support it can to programs for education and rural development, and a
considerable amount of staff time is currently being devoted to the
identification of possible projects in these two sectors. However, the
capital expenditures involved are likely to be quite small.  Finaly,
in view of the great potential scarcity of water in ilexico, plans are
going ahead for a national wtater study to be carried out witlh the Bank's
help, possibly with some financing froia the UIIDP, and a project for the
supply of water to 'iexico City and adjacent urban areas is scheduled
for appraisal shortly.
16.       The choice of 3ank projects in :,exico is naturally governed to
an i;gportant extent by the priorities of the iiexican Government and by
the availability of financing froma other sources. Since in the past the
Inter-American Development 3ank has been able to provide soft loans for
projects of a social character, and has also been more liberal,in
financing local costs, iexico has sought its assistance in preference to
that of the I3RD for such projects as feeder roads and minor irrigation
works.s  he main contribution to the external financingp of industrial
development in .esxico has come from export credit agencies and private
sources. Over the period 1966-70, the 3Jac accounted for 11 percent of
the flow of medium and long-tenm capital to iexxico and the D3 for 5 per-
cent. 'These proportions are likely to be sigiificantly higher in future



Annex IV
Page 4
in conformity wJith the ilexican Governmentts aim of improving its extermal
debt structure, but the greater part of the capital wrhich iexico requires
from abroad will continue to come from private financial institutions
and export credit agencies. "'
