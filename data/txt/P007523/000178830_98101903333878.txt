MEXICO
APPRAISAL OF FOURTH POWER SECTOR PROGRAM (1972-1974)
SUMMARY AND C(NCLUSICNS
i.        This report covers an appraisal of the power sector's continuing
investment program and the financial position during 1972-1976 of Comision
Federal de Electricidad (CFE) and Compania de Luz y Fuerza del Centro, S.A.
(Centro), the two main entities that comprise Mexico's public power sector.
A Bank loan of US$125 million is proposed to help finance the foreign exchange
cost of generation, transmission, and distribution facilities needed to meet
Mexico's increasing power demand. In recent years aggregate peak load has
been growing at a rate of over 12% per year; it reached 5,720 M' in 1970.
ii.       The Bank has made ten loans for power in Mexico for a total of
US$580 million. The proposed loan would be the fourth to the power sector
as a whole. The previous sector loans (436-ME, 544-ME, and 659-ME) were
made in 1965, 1968 and 1970 for US$110 million, 90 million and 125 million,
respectively. As of April 30, 1972, US$27.5 million remained to be disbursed
from the latest loan. This amount is expected to be fully disbursed during
the second half of 1972. The Bank's experience with the sector has generally
been satisfactory, although parts of previous programs have suffered sub-
stantial delays or have not been executed (e.g., frequency unification).
iii.      The Borrower would be CFE which is responsible for the planning and
the finances of the sector. As for the previous loans to the sector, Nacional
Financiera, S.A. (NAFIN) would be the co-borrower. Under a subsidiary agree-
ment, CFE would make funds available to Centro for expenditures eligible for
Bank financing.
iv.       The merger of Centro into CFE would be the final step in the con-
solidation cf the Mexican power sector. The liquidation of Mexlight, the
holding company which owns Centro and which itself is owned by CFE, is expected
to be completed by the end of 1972. The full institutional integration of
Centro into CFE is underway; however, progress is modest because of the
reluctance of Centro's labor union, which has long enjoyed higher wages and
more benefits than CFE's unions, to give up its vantage position.
v.        The Bank project is the 1972-1974 slice of the investment program.
Total cost of the project is estimated at US$1,368 million; Bank financing
for these expenditures is assumed to amount to US$172 million or 12% of total
expenditures (US$47 million from Loans 544-ME and 659-ME, and US$125 million
from the proposed loan ).  The balance of the project would be financed as
follows: US$68 million by loans made jointly with past Bank loans; US$50
million by loans to be made by foreign export financing institutions parallel
to the proposed loan; US$69 million by foreign suppliers; US$282 million by local
suppliers and financial institutions; US$404 million by foreign financial
institutions and through bond issues w(including US$208 million expected to be
rolled over); and, US$323 million by net internal cash generation and contri-
butions by the Government, the States and the consumers.



-ii -
vi.        During 1972 the Government and CFE expects to work out an agreement
on parallel financing with the main potential supplier countries. These
countries will be asked to finance 100% of the foreign exchange component of
selected large equipment contracts won by their nationals on the basis of
bidding restricted to these countries.
vii.        Items to be financed by the proposed Bank loan would be procured
on the basis of international competitive bidding with a maximum preference
margin of 15% for Mexican manufacturers. The following would be eligible
for financing: (i) 50% of payments still to be made for contracts placed
before January 1, 1972 under Joint financing agreements, (ii) 100% of the
cif cost of contracts won by local and foreign firms for items not covered
by joint or parallel loans, and (iii) the foreign exchange component of
civil works contracts. Orders for about 27% of the investment program would
be restricted to local bidding, and financed by the sector.
viii.     Although the sector has earned returns in excess of the 8% minimum
agreed with the Bank under previous loans, it finds itself in a difficult
financial position because of high debt service charges resulting from
excessive reliance on high-cost, short-term credit. The Government has
agreed it would allow the sector to generate (a) at least 18% of investment
in 1973 and 25% in following years from its net internal resources, and
(b) a rate of return on net fixed assets of at least 8%. In order to comply
with these requirements the sector has applied for a 22.5% tariff increase
in one step. An increase of at least 17.5% before the end of 1972 is a
condition of effectiveness of the proposed loan. If only this minimum is
implemented it might have to be followed by a further increase in 1974.
ix.       The power sector has not met its obligations in past agreements on the con-
version of its 50 cycle Central system to 60 cycles.  However, in July 1971 the
President of the Republic signed a decree ordering the sector to carry out
frequency unification. A second decree defining the financing of the operation
and creating the organization which will implement the changeover of customers'
installations was signed in May 1972. This will allow the sector to begin the
actual changeover by the beginning of 1973, and to complete it by 1977.
X.       On the basis of the agreements reached, the project is suitable for
a Bank loan of UIS25 million for a term of 20 years, including a 5-year
grace period.



APPRAISAL OF
FOURTH POWER SECTOR PROGRAM (1972 - 1974)
MEXICO
1. INTRODUCTION
1.01      The Government of Mexico has asked the Bank for a loan to help
finance the Mexican power sector's continuing investment program. Comision
Federal de Electricidad (CFE) would be the borrower and--as with previous
Bank loans to CFE--Nacional Financiera, S.A. (NAFIN), the Government develop-
ment bank, would be co-borrower. A loan of US$125 million is proposed. A
portion of the loan would be relent to CFE's subsidiary, Compania de Luz y
Fuerza del Centro, S.A. (Centro), through an arrangement satisfactory to the
Bank.
1.02      The Bank has made ten power loans in Mexico for a total sum of
US$579.8 million. Of this amount, US$475.7 million or 82% has been lent to
CFE and US$1041. million or 18% either to Centro or the Mexican Light and
Power Company, Ltd. (Mexlight). Annex 1 lists the amounts, dates and
beneficiaries of these loans. Over the past twenty years, the Bank has
helped to finance the bulk of the sector's new generating capacity, as well
as large amounts of transmission and distribution. The Bank's experience
with the sector has generally been satisfactory, although parts of previous
programs have suffered substantial delays or have not been executed (e.g.,
frequency unification, discussed in paragraphs 4.02 and 4.03).
1.03      The loan now proposed would be the fourth in a series of power
sector program loans for Mexico. The third power sector loan (Loan 659-ME) of
US$125 million is not yet fully disbursed and the closing date of June 30,
1972, will undoubtedly have to be extended by several months. On April 30,
1972, US$27$5 million of the loan remained, and this amount is not expected
to be drawn down until late this year. Disbursement of Loan 659-ME has been
slow mainly because the Government insisted on protecting Mexican industry
by restricting the tendering for many items of equipment to Mexican firms,
thus orecluding the financing of these contracts by the Bank loan. Loan
659-ME was planned to cover 25% of the sector's capital expenditure during
a two-year period; actually it will cover about 17% during a two and a half
year period.
1.04      Funds from the proposed loan will be required by the second half of
1972. Expenditure on generation, transmission, and distribution during mid
1972 - end of 1974, the expected period of disbursement of the loan, will
amount to some US$1,150 million, of which the proposed loan would cover about
11%.  In connection with the three previous loans, the Bank, Mexico and major
equipment supplying countries had arranged "joint" financing. These arrange-
ments provided that equipment orders of at least US$200,000 procured under
international competitive bidding and awarded to a supplier of a country
participating in such an arrangement, would be financed jointly by that



-2-
country and the Bank. The latest arrangement provided for 50/50 joint
financing by the Bank and ten supplying countries. Because of the need for
participation by all major equipment-supplying countries in Joint financing
arrangements and the decision of the United States not to do so in the future,
no joint financing is expected for contracts let after January 1, 1972, the
cutoff for orders to be financed under the present joint financing arrangement.
However, it is expected that contracts already awarded, and for which payments
are due after this date, would continue to be financed jointly - the Bank share
being provided first from the undisbursed amount of Loan 659-ME and then from
the proposed loan.
1.05      In order to continue the mobilization of foreign finance in
connection with Bank lending for the Mexican power sector, specific large
equipment contracts to be let after January 1, 1972 would be financed under
a "parallel" financing scheme. This arrangement would call for the export
credit agencies of the participating countries to finance the full foreign
exchange component of contracts won by their nationals. Participation
in the bidding for this equipment would be restricted to firms from countries
which make a prior commitment to provide finance.
1.06      This report is the result of an appraisal mission to Mexico during
the second half of November 1971, carried out by Messrs. R. A. Ribi,
E. C. Wessela and J. A. Martinez, and an updating mission by MessrE. Wessels
and R. du Mee in January 1972 to review the latest financial information.

2. THE SECTOR
2.01      During the first half of this century, an increasing number of
scattered enterprises provided the public power supply in Mexico.  Until
1939, when the Mexican Government created CFE, all of these utilities were
privately-owned, and generally provided reasonably good service. However,
during the fifties the private utilities restricted their new investment in
anticipation of the nationalization of the sector. Consequently, in many
systems the quality of the service declined until, in 1960, the Government,
after acquiring a majority of shares of the private power companies,
nationalized the sector. This measure opened the way for a progressive
merger of the smaller companies into the two main entities which, from then
on, formed the power sector, CFE and Centre. At present, Centl'o is a sub-
sidiary of CFE (see paragraph 3.04). In parallel with these mergers, which
improved the operational efficiency of the sector, a large program of inter-
connections between formerly isolated systems was carried out,which also
helped improve the general quality of service. During the sixties, annual
energy production grew at increasing rates averaging over 10%, with a maximum
of 15% in 1969. In this same period, the sector purchased more and more
electrical equipment from the fast growing local industry.
2.02      By early 1971, public power supply reached 96% of the urban
population of 30 million and 37% of the rural population of 21 million--
urban population being defined as the population of centers of more than
2,500 inhabitants. At the same time Mexico's installed generating capacity
was 7,297 MW. Of this total, 1,206 MW was captive industrial plant. The
remaining 6,091 MW served the ten major systems and the various isolated
centers of the power sector; CFE owned 5,41 MW, Centro 667 MW and several
small utilities operated a total of 10 MW of plant. Annex 2 gives details
of growth of capacity and output in the past.
2.03      Centro sells energy to consumers in and around Mexico City; all of
its sales are retail. It generates with its own plant, but also purchases
in bulk from CFE about 2/3 of the energy it sends out; in 1970, the purchases
amounted to 6,400 GWh. Centro's network, and those of CFE's generating plants
which supply it, operate at 50 Hz; all other public supply is at 60 Hz. CFE
generates and distributes energy to consumers in virtually all the rest of
Mexico.
2.04      The joint installed capacity of CFE and Centro at the beginning of
1971 was 6,081 MW and consisted of:
Hydro-electric plant              3,194 MW
Steam-turbine plant               2,307 MW
Gas-turbine plant                   339 MW
Diesel plant                        241 MW



- 4 -
Transmission lines, at the same date, consisted of:
400 kV           2,008 km
220 kV           2,368 km
161 kV           1,258 km
150 kV             375 km
138 kV             286 km
110 kV           7,312 km
2.05      In 1970, sales of energy were 12.9% higher than in 1969; this
compares with the average rate of increaae over the period 1965-1970 of
12.3% per year. Principal figures for 1970 were:
Energy generated (gross)                26,239 aWh
Energy sent out (net, including
110 5Wh imported from the U.S.)        25,410 awh
Energy sold                             21,828 GWh
Station losses                           3.3% (of gross)
Transmission and disbribution losses   14.1% (of net)
Losses were reasonable; the tranamission and distribution losses of 14%
compare with 15.2% and 9% respectively for regional systems in Argentina
and the U.S.. Past sales to consuers and forecast sales are given in
Annex 3; Annex 4 lists sales and revenues by categories of consumers.
2.06      The sector's plant is generally in good working condition.
However, maximum demand has been growing rapidly (the average load growth
for 1967-1970 was 12.8% per year) and there have been delays in commission-
ing important new generating facilities and in the start of frequency
unification   In 1971 power shortages occurred in three large systems
and, since the delays will not be made up before 1973 at best, such short-
ages are likely to recur in 1972. As a result, maintenance in these
systems will undoubtedly continue to be less thorough than desirable-for
the next year or so. While the delay of frequency unification has been due to
slow Government action in establishing the legal basis for the change-
over (paragraph 4.03), the delays in plant coimiasioning are sainly due to
poor performance in procurement and to low estimates of construction times.

3. THE BORROWER
Comision Federal de Electricidad (CFE)
3.01      CFE, the borrower, was founded in 1937 as a branch of the Mexican
Government. In 1949, it became an autonomous public enterprise. It is
controlled  by a Board of Directors consisting of (a) the Secretary of
Commerce and Industry; (b) the Under-Secretary of Finance; (c) the Director
General of Petroleos Mexicanos (PEMEX); and (d) the Director General of
NAFIN. The Board of Directors appoints the Director General (who is the
chief executive) and the Sub-Director General.
3.02      CFE is divided administratively into 14 divisions and geographically
into ten regions. At present, it has about 22,000 employees and supplies
3.7 million customers. Thus CFE has about 1 employee for 170 customers, which
is a reasonable ratio for its market characteristics.
3.03      The Government exempts CFE from most taxes, and also refunds 87%
of the import duties paid by CFE.
Compania de Luz y Fuerza del Centro, S.A. (Centro)
3.0h      Centro is owned by the Mexican Light and Power Company, Ltd.
(Mexlight), which was founded as a Canadian corporation in 1902. CFE now owns
about 93% of Mexlight's total share capital and hence controls Centro.  Three
members of CFE's Board, namely, the Secretary of Commerce and Industry, the
Under-Secretary of Finance, and the Director General of NAFIN, are also on
the Board of Centro.
3.05      Centro has about 14,500 employees and serves about 1.5 million
customers.  Thus Centro employs about one person for every 105 customers, which
is rather a poor ratio, given the high density character of its market. This
is mainly because Centro's trade union insists that Centro's personnel be used
instead of contractors for practically all of its construction work.  The manage-
ment disagrees with the union on this point, but, in the short run, is unlikely
to be able to modify the current practice.
Integration of CFE and Centro
3.06      Although the power sector was nationalized in 1960, institutional
integration has been slow, primarily because of opposition from the trade unions.
It was only in 1967 that the 19 subsidiaries of CFE were merged with CFE, after
the two unions representing the personnei of CFE and the subsidiaries had
agreed to the gradual introduction of identical conditions of contract.



- 6 -
3.07      During 1968 CFE acquired a majority of the shares of Mexlight.  In
1969 management of the sector's debt and funds was centralized with CFE, and
Centro's union pledged its support for integration of the sector. Presently,
CFE's Director General, Sub-Director General, and the heads of its Controller's
and Legal departments hold corresponding positions in Centro; CFE coordinates
system planning and procurement; a unified system of accounts is being
established; and Mexlight's Toronto office has been closed. Integration of
the sector will be complete when Mexlight is liquidated and Centro becomes
a division of CFE. By the end of 1972, the first of these objectives should
have been achieved and all of Centro's shares transferred to CFE. Several
recent changes in Centro's top echelons are further steps towards the second
objective. However, full institutional integration cannot take place until
Centro's union, which has long enjoyed higher wages and more benefits than
CFE's unions, accepts job changes such as abolishing the post of Centro's
Director General and replacing the position of Sub-Director General with a
divisional manager's post under CFE's Manager of Operations.
Organization and Management
3.08      CFE's Director General is usually replaced every aix years, when a
new Government takes office. The last change occurred in December 1970, and
was followed by an unusually large number of new managerial appointments, which
have probably improved CFE's administration. But they have not as yet resolved
CFE's problems of internal coordination.  While CFE's operating divisions and
Centro's departments are each reasonably well managed, the organization of CFE '
head office in Mexico City has not kept pace with its rapid growth of responsi-
bilities. There is little cooperation between departments, and control and
budgetary information are inadequate.
3.09      Between 1966 and 1970, CFE's data processing section completed a
system of computer programs called SAI--Sistema de Administracion de Inversiones--
to improve management's control of the program of construction by providing data
on the status and the program of procurement and construction, and on expendi-
tures for and costs of investment. However, SAI has not yet been implemented,
mainly due to lack of cooperation between the departments concerned and because
the system is rather sophisticated for a first step in computerized investment
control. CFE's data processing section is also preparing a budget control
system narrowly related to SAI but essentially providing data on the cash flow
into, within and out of the sector and emphasizing the comparison between
allocated funds for given items and time periods (for which SAI would produce the
basic data) and actual expenditures for these items and periods. The imple-
mentation of SAI (or a similar system) and of computerized budget control appears
to be the only way to provide the sector management in the next few years with
the tools required to control and adequately coordinate the sector's various
activities and the parts of its organization responsible for these activities.
CFE plans to consult Electricite de France and SOFRELEC (France) in order to obtain
an outside judgment on the sector's short and long term needs for investment and
budget control systems. During negotiations CFE agreed to prepare by late 1972
a timetable for the implementation of such systems.



-7-
Training
3.10        The quality of training of lower and medium echelon personnel appears
satisfactory. At the higher echelons substantial improvement is needed, in
particular, the training of specialized personnel for the operation of generating
plants (including plant managers) and the grooming of future division and depart-
ment managers. CFE planned to start in 1972 a program of improved training of
plant personnel including the use of a plant simulator. Bank supervision missions
would periodically assess the results of this program and would also review the
steps taken by the present managers to train successors.
Load and Energy Forecasting
3.11        CFE's forecasts of peak power demand (MW) and energy requirements
(GWh) are generally satisfactory, though the methods used need further improve-
ment. CFE prepares the projections annually, system by system (Annexes 9 & 10).
In some systems only global extrapolations are made. In others, large
industrial loads are separated; then the other categories are extrapolated,
and existing and projected industrial loads are added to the extrapolation of
the other categories. In still other systems CFE prepares global extrapolations
for the various subsystems and aggregates them taking into account diversity
factors derived from experience. During negotiations CFE agreed to improve
further its forecasting methods in connection with the implementation of long
term planning for its generation and transmission systems (paragraph 3.12). It
would, in particular, use more aggregations of demand extrapolations for areas
and/or consumer categories; as a further step, it would carry out--at least for
the largest systems--market studies relating the future demand to the expected
demographic and economic development. The Bank would continue to review the
forecasts from time to time.
Investnent Planning
3.12        CFE's planning department works with a rolling 10-year investment
program; the first five years of which are projected item by item, and the
last five years in less detail. The program is revised at least once a year.
CFE's consultants, SOFRELEC, reviewed and approved the main points of the
September 1971 revision of the 1972-1981 program, on which this appraisal is
based. CFE is also continuously improving the computer programs it uses to
establish the 10-year plan. However, the time has come when CFE should also
begin to plan for a longer period. CFE acknowledges the need for long term
planning and has agreed to study and implement a system for the long term
planning (horizon at least 20 years) of the sector's generation and transmission
facilities. This work would be carried out in the period 1972-1974 by CFE's
planning department assisted by the French consultants, SOFRELEC, on the basis
of terms of reference to be discussed with the Bank.  These terms of reference
should ensure that the planniitg is coordinated with the work of a study group
formed by the Government early in 1971 to formulate short term and long term
national policies for all energy usage. CFE expects  to let the contract to
SOFRELEC during the third quarter of 1972.
3.13        Development of distribution networks is planned in a generally
satisfactory way by CFE's Operations Department and Centrots Planning Section.
However, since the planning of large urban distribution networks (Guadalajara,
Monterrey, etc.) is at a rather short term, CFE, during loan negotiations,
agreed to extend the planning horizon for these large networks from the present
two or three years to at least five years.



-8-
Auditors
3.14      The Secretaria del Patrimonio Nacional is the supervisory agency
for Government-owned enterprises and appoints independent accountants to audit
the financial statements of CFE and Centro. The firm of Manuel Resa which is
qualified and follows generally accepted accounting standards audited both
undertakings in 1969 and 1970, and will continue the audit of Centro's books
for 1971. A new firm, Suarez del Real y Valle Orozco, has been appointed to
audit CFE's accounts from 1971. The credentials of CFE's new auditors are
acceptable, although the firm does not have experience with a public utility
of CFE's size and complexity. Two meetings with the partner responsible for
CFE's audit indicated a willingness to comply with the Bank's requirements,
and the firm has agreed to prepare consolidated financial statements for the
sector.

4. THE SECTOR PROGRAM
The Project
4.01       The Bank project is the sector's continuing investment program. The
purposes of the program are to enable the sector to meet the expected growth
in demand, and to maintain an adequate standard of servide. The project
includes facilities under construction by January 1, 1972 or to be started prior
to the end of 1974 and comprises:
(a)  3,015 MW of hydro plant,
(b)  3,900 MW of steam-turbine plant,
(c)  670 MW of nuclear plant,
(d)  500 MW of gas-turbine plant,
(e)  150 NW of geothermal plant,
(f)  15 WN of diesel plant,
(g)  3,000 kim of 400 kV transmission lines,
(h)  2,900 km of 220 kV transmission lines,
(i)  5,600 km of 69-161 kV transmission lines,
(J)  17,000 MVA of main substations,
(k)  300 MVA of small substations,
(1)  the expansion of distribution networks and village electrification,
costing annually about US$120 million, and
(m) the first phase of frequency unification costing about US$3 million
annually.
Annex 5 is a list of the major facilities included in the project.
Frequency Unif icat io
4e02       Of the sector's total installed capacity of 6,091 MW in 1971, 2,380 MW
in the Central system operated  at 50 Hz and 3,711 MI at 60 Hz. The Mexican
Government has decided that the national frequency would be 60 Hz and the power
sector is planning the conversion to 60 Hz of the above 50 Hz generating plant
in the Central system, plus the conversion or replacement of frequency-sensitive
equipment which consumers in the area now have in use.  CFE, assisted by its
consultants, Bechtel (U.S.), now estimates the cost of conversion to be about



- 10 -
Mex$1,600 million (US$128 million). The estimate appears reasonable; it is
based on the actual costs of a similar operation in Caracas (Venezuela),
which was completed in 1970. As compared to the development of independent
50 and 60 Hz systems, frequency unification and the subsequent development
of a single 60 Hz system in southern Mexico is still the least cost solution
for discount rates up to at least 12%.
l.03      Although the three previous loans had covenants specifying time-
tables for the first phase of frequency unification, the actual changeover
has not yet started. Several master plans were prepared, each of which, in
turn, became obsolete when the Government did not take the steps necessary to
implement them. In August 1971, the President signed a decree directing
that the work should be done.  A second decree, creating the entity which
would convert customers' installations, and stipulating the respective costs
to be borne by the Government, CFE, and the consumers, was signed by the
President in May 1972.  On the basis of these two decrees, frequency unifi-
cation is finally expected to go ahead. Actual conversion is to start in
January 1973 and to be completed in 1977. During negotiations, agreement was
reached on a timetable for implementing the first stage of frequency unification
consisting of the changeover by September 1974 of frequency sensitive equipment
corresponding to a maximum non-coincidental demand of about 600 MW.
Nuclear Plant
4.04      In 1968-1969, CFE assisted by NUS Corporation (U.S.) prequalified
eight firms, which were asked to submit bids for the nuclear steam supply
system, including fuel, for a 670 MW power station to be installed near Veracruz.
As an alternative, the bidders could offer a "package" including the turbo-
generator and further equipment of their choice, up to a complete installation.
Seven firms submitted bids, which CFE opened in January 1970. CFE, together
with the U.S. consultants, Burns & Roe, evaluated the bids which showed, in
particular, that the nuclear plant was economically justified and therefore had
a place in CFE's 10-year program. However, as a result of improper bidding
procedures by some bidders, no contract was awarded. Late in 1971, bidders
were asked to update their proposals; one other manufacturer was also permitted
to submit a proposal. CFE opened the new bids in March 1972, and plans to award
the contract during the second half of 1972, and to commission the plant in 1977.
4.05      Based on the 1970 offers, CFE has estimated the cost of the plant at
US$130 million or US$195 per kW excluding engineering, overheads, and interest
during construction, which is about 20% below the estimated cost of similar plants
presently under construction in other countries.  This estimate might have to be
revised when the new offers are analyzed. However, the possible changes are not
likely to affect substantially the forecast total annual investments of the
sector in the period 1972-1974.
4.06      Since the manufacturers of nuclear equipment are ready to offer
financing with terms of at least 15 years and at reasonable interest rates, the
nuclear steam supply system (or the "package") would be financed through
supplier credits. If CFE decides to procure the turbogenerator separately, it
would ask for its inclusion in that part of the program to be financed by
parallel loans (see paragraph 6.17). The rest of the conventional equipment
might be included in a future Bank loan.



- 11 -
High Voltage Interconnections
4.07      The Puebla-Veracruz system (Map 1) is presently interconnected
with the Michoacan-Chapala-Guanajuato system through a 220 kV link to
constitute the Southern Interconnected system. In the North, the Falcon-
Monterrey, the Torreon-Chihuahua, and the Durango systems (see Map 2) are
now interconnected through 220 kV lines.  In connection with the installation
of the nuclear plant near Veracruz and of two 900 MW conventional thermal
plants in the areas of Tampico on the east coast and Mazatlan on the west
coast, CFE is planning successively to interconnect the Northern system with
the Sonora-Sinaloa system at 220 kV and then this enlarged Northern system
with the Southern system at 400 kV, both in the east and the west. Thus,
by about 1977 (when the frequency changeover in the Central system should
be completed), Mexico's main systems except for those of Tijuana-Mexicali
and Yucatan will be interconnected; this will undoubtedly result in more
economical operation, in particular from the use of larger, relatively less
expensive generating units.
Village Electrification
4.08      Early in 1971, when public power supply reached about 7.8 million
people in rural areas (i.e., about 37% of the rural population), the President
announced that during his 6-year term, CFE would bring electricity to about
5.3 million more people in 9,000 small towns and villages. Thus, by 1976,
about 13.1 million people, or nearly 55% of the rural population, would have
electricity. This program would require an investment of about Mex$350 million
(US$28 million) per year--less than 7% of the sector's annual investment
(Annex 7). Budget constraints caused CFE and the Secretaria de la Presidencia
subsequently to reduce the corresponding amounts in the sector program to
Mex$250 million (US$20 million) for 1972, and to Mex$150 million (US$12 million)
per year from 1973 onward. However, pressure from other sectors of the Govern-
ment and from the States, which finance 33% of the program, may well induce CFE
to carry out more of the program than it presently plans. To provide for this
contingency, the estimates in this report include an annual allocation to
village electrification of Mex$350 million.
Cost Estimates
4.09      The sector's estinated construction expenditures for the 5-year
period 1972-1976 are set out in Annex 8. Summarized belowi is the cost of the
program for 1972 through 197h:

8,9B1   8.123  17L104    718      650   1,368    100
4.10      Estimates for equipment are based on current international and
Mexican prices; estimatea for civil engineering works are based on the cost
of works of a similar nature that have been completed recently. As in the
past, each item in the program includes an overall allowance of about 10% for
all contingencies, which is rather low.
4.11      The capital costs of steam plant (ex4luding overheads and interest
during construction) range from US$110 per kW for the 300 MW units to US$170
per kW for the 37.5 MW unite; gaa turbines range from US$99 per kW (35 MW
units) to US$110 per kW (14 MW unita).  Costs of single-circuit transmission
lines are about US 30,000 per km for 00 kV lines, U$20,000 per km for 230 kV
lines, and US$12,000 per km for 115 kV lines.  Distribution expenditures are
as projected by CFE, in detail for 1972 and globally for subsequent years;
they correspond to about 60% of investment in generation and appear to be
reasonable.
4.12      In the past, costa of individual projects have always overrun CFE's
estimates. During the past two years, and particularly in 1971, CFE's manage-
ment has improved the quality of its estimating and its control of costs, but
the estimated costs of some of the items for generation and transmission still
appear to be rather low. Nevertheless, CFE's estimates of annual expenditure
have not been increased in this appraisal because (i) the sector's projected
average annual expenditures for the period 1972-1974 are about 30% higher than
the actual 1971 investment, (ii) the planned invesBtment is close to the sector's
physical capacity to install new facilities, making it unlikely that more than
the planned facilities can be carried out (it is even doubtful whether the
sector will be able to complete as much as it plans), and (iii) the amounts
planned for distribution and village electrification are essentially global



- 13 -
allocations; the size of this investment can be adapted to the financial
circumstances and in fact, these items are considered as budget blancing
items by both the sector and the Secretaria de la Presidencia, which approves
the sector's budget each year.
Amount of the Loan
4.13      A Bank loan of US$125 million is proposed, to be disbursed during
the period mid 1972 to end of 1974 against eligible items in the program.
Procurement and Disbursement
4.14      The loan would cover:
a)  50% of payments due on contracts placed before January 1,
1972 under the joint lending agreements of Loan 659-ME;
b) the full CIF cost of equipment procured abroad on the basis
of international competitive bidding, provided there is
neither joint nor parallel financing (paragraph 6.17) for
such equipment;
c) 100% of the cost (less identifiable taxes) of equipment
contracts won by Mexican manufacturers on the basis of
international competitive bidding with a 15% local preference;
and
d) 35% of the cost of civil engineering works, this percentage
representing the estimated average foreign exchange component;
international bidding, as under previous loans, would be
required for contracts over Mex$20 million (US$ equiv. 1.6 million).
Bids for equipment would be compared on the basis of cost at the place of
delivery exclusive of duties (i.e. preferential treaties would not be reflected
in the comparative costs) but taking into account the 15% preference for
Mexican manufacturers.
h.15      The following table indicates the sources from which the program is
expected to be financed through 1974, and the amounts each source is expected
to contribute to each of the categories listed in paragraph 4.14 above:

This table and Annex 11 which gives a breakdown by years of the above figures
are based on:
a) actual orders placed;
b) an assumed pattern of award of equipment contracts to Mexican
and foreign firms similar to that experienced in the past; and



- 15 -
c)   the assumption that about 20% of the estimated cost of the
program would be for contracts awarded to Mexican suppliers
either directly or on the basis of local bidding; this percentage
is lower than the actual value for the past two years but is
realistic in view of the present Government's policy of
encouraging international bidding in order to improve the
competitiveness of the Mexican industry.
4.16      It is expected that about US$17 million from the new Bank loan will
be applied to civil engineering works and consultants' fees, leaving about
US$108 million for equipment. During loan negotiations, the Bank and CFE
agreed on a final list of items CFE will procure during 1972-1974 by inter-
national bidding with a 15% preference for Mexican bidders. This list
includes a sufficient number of contracts large enough in value to make
reasonably sure that payments during the period mid 19 7 2 -third quarter
of 1974, eligible for reimbursement by the Bank, will amount to at least
US$108 million. CFE would finance payments for those items which exceed
US$108 million from internal cash generation, through commercial bank
loans, or bond issues.
4.17      It is estimated that CFE would relend about US$15 million from the
proposed Bank loan to Centro to cover the cost of Centro's contracts eligible
for Bank financing.
4.18      The closing date for the proposed loan would be December 31, 197h
which should give enough time to process applications for reimbursement and
allow for some slippage in the program. A schedule of disbursements is shown
in Annex 12. Since the loan would help to finance a continuing program, the
Bank should consider extending the closing date for a reasonable period if
any funds remain undisbursed by the closing date.
Design and Supervision
4.19      Arrangements for engineering are satisfactory.  CFE's and Centro's
engineering staffs are designing the small generating plants, the transmission
lines and the distribution expansion. Consulting engineers have been engaged
to design and supervise the construction of thie major new steam plants. BICA,
an association of Bechtel of the U.S. and Ingenieros Civiles Asociados of
Mexico, is designing the 300 MW fourth unit at Valle de Mexico power station
and the first two 300 MW units at Tula power station. Burns & Roe (U.S.) with
Bufete (Mexico) are supervising the installation of the fourth unit at Valle de
Mexico; Diplan, an association of Black and Veatch (U.S.) and Alen (Mexico),is
designing and supervising the 82 MW extension of Monterrey power station; and
Gibbs & Hill (U.S.) is designing and supervising the 300 MW third unit at
Salamanca. SOFRELEC of France is carrying out a feasibility study for the
Chicoasen-Sumidero-Copainala hydro-electric development (about 2,000 W) on the
Rio Grijalva in south-eastern Mexico. A Board of International Consultants,
which was appointed by the Bank in the early 1960s to review the design of thin
arch dams financed by the Bank, and whose services CFE has retained since that
time, will continue to review major hydro-electric projects. CFE has also
engaged several foreign engineers for assistance with special problems.

5.  JUSTIFICATION OF ThE PROGRAM
5.01      Since World War II the Mexican economy has evolved from a basic
dependence on agriculture and mining to a more balanced semi-industrialized
economy, and has maintained an annual rate of growth of GDP of about 7% over the
past ten years. A reliable supply of electricity has been among the most
important of the basic services supporting this impressive economic performance.
Sales of electricity have been increasing by 13% annually in recent years,
almost double the rate of growth cf GDP. As a result of a sharp deceleration
in growth in 1971, the Government is giving much attention to expanding exports
and increasing public savings. Substantial increases in fuel prices and
electricity tariffs are to be a major ingredient of the program to increase
public sector savings.
Forecast of Demand
5.02      Sales of electricity increased by only about 10% in 1971 in step with
the slower economic growth. However, increases in sales of about 12% in 1972
and 14% in 1973 and 1974 are forecast on the assumption that: (i) a quick
recovery of the economy will take place, (ii) several large industrial loads
will be connected in 1973 and 1974, and (iii) there is a backlog of demand in
three systems which will also be met in 1973 and 1974 (paragraph 2.06). These
projections appear reasonable.
5.03      The table below shows the maximum gross demand forecast through 1976.
Demand in the 50 Hz Central system will decline towards zero as this system
becomes integrated with other systems through frequency unification.    The
brackets indicate when these other systems will be interconnected.

Least Cost Alternatives
5.04      In the annual review of its program (paragraph 3.12), CFE studies
all practical alternative methods of meeting the same peak load and energy
requirements, given a minimum standard of dependability. Presently the
sector uses as a planning target, a loss of load probability of 0.3 days
per year (see boxes in the charts of Annex 9), which is a rather high standard.
However, except for some isolated smaller systems, the sector will not be able
to reach this standard for some time. In any event, the justification of this
standard will be reviewed in connection with the proposed long-term develop-
ment study (paragraph 3.11).
5.05      The alternatives are compared with the help of a series of computer
programs which take into account such factors as the probabilities of runoffs
at the intakes of hydro-electric plants, scheduled maintenance, frequencies
of outages, etc. Whether or not any given project is to be included in the
program is decided on the basis of an analysis of the present-worth of its
total capital and operating costs, using a discount rate of 10%. The program
details are not sensitive to small increases in the discount rate to reflect
a higher estimate of the opportunity cost of capital. If the discount rate
were increased to 11 or 12%, most of the least cost solutions would remain
the same. In some cases, an alternative different from that chosen might
appear preferable, however, the difference between the present-worth of the
alternatives is likely to be within the margin of error of the estimates.
Economic Returm
5.o6      The internal economic return on the 1972-1974 time-slice of invest-
ment as calculated in Annex 13 is about 14%. The assumed benefits
include only directly attributable revenues. The full value of the internal
economic return, which would reflect the extent to which Mexican consumers would
be prepared to purchase more expensive privately generated power for industry,
lighting etc. would undoubtedly be higher.

6. FINANCES
6.01      Since Loan 659-ME was made early in 1970, the sector's finances have
deteriorated. Expenditure on construction has been more than expected. In
1970 and 1971, gross fixed assets grew by 27%, compared with a projected 20%;
about 87% of this expansion was financed by borrowing. Although the return
on the sector's rate base for the past several years has equalled or exceeded
8%, net internal cash generation after debt service has been able to cover
only a small part of new investment because debt service has been high as a
result of heavy use of medium-term credits from foreign financial institutions.
The Government's study group on energy policy has recommended tariff increases
which would considerably improve the sector's finances.
Financial Performance
6.02      Consolidated income statements for 1969-1971 are shown in Annex 15.
Net income before interest has been practically constant since 1969, but the
rate of return declined from 9.9% in 1969 to 8.0% in 1971. As a consequence
of increased borrowings, annual debt service in 1970 and 1971 was covered
only 1.3 and 1.1 times respectively by internal cash generation, well below
the figures of 1.5 and 1.7 times forecast in the appraisal for Loan 659-ME.
6.03      The 87% of the sector's expenditure on construction during 1970 and
1971 financed by borrowing was a sharp increase from the 65% forecast in the
appraisal for Loan 659-ME. Due to poor control, construction expenditures
exceeded the amount planned by 28%, or Mex$2.5 billion, and disbursement of
Loans 544-ME and 659-ME was slower than expected. Heavy borrowing on 5-10
year terms at high rates of interest was necessary to bridge the gap. The
result was very rapid growth in debt service, which absorbed practically all
the funds generated by operations in 1971. In early 1971 maturities totalling
Mex$2.1 billion of the sector's debt to NAFIN which fell due in 1970-1974 were
rescheduled (Annex 17, paragraph 20) and the sector's debt management was
centralized in CFE, but despite these measures the sector is no longer able to
meet the interest coverage test required by the existing loans.
6.04      The debt-limitation covenant of Loan 659-ME, which has been renewed
in connection with the proposed loan, consists of two debt/asset tests and an
interest coverage test (Annex 17, paragraph 14); all three tests must be
passed before debt can be incurred without the Bank's consent. The debt/asset
tests have been met. The interest coverage test stipulates that actual net
income before interest must be not less than 1.6 times the maximum interest
payable on consolidated debt in any future year. Interest coverage on an annual
basis declined from 2.0 times in 1969 to 1.4 times in 1971, partly due to the
heavy reliance on borrowings mentioned above. The sector is not expected to
meet the interest coverage test through 1973, and the Bank's authorization
will thus be required for debts contracted in connection with the project.
Financial Position
6.05      The sector's 1969-1970 consolidated balance sheets are shown in
Annex 14, together with an estimated balance sheet for 1971, which is sum-
marized below. On December 31, 1971, about 45% of long-term capitalization
was equity and 55% long-term debt.

37.4              3.01
6.06      The sector's fixed assets are valued at historical cost; there is
reason to believe that they may be undervalued. Calculations based on a
recent economic survey undertaken by the Central Bank show, that at December 31,
1967, the replacement value of the sector's gross fixed assets was in the region
of Mex$28 billion while the book value was Mex$23 billion. CFE has been asked
to carry out a study of the replacement cost of the sector's fixed assets. If
this study shows that fixed assets are substantially undervalued, practical
arrangements for their revaluation will be discussed.
6.07      Of the long-term debt, about 37% is owed to NAFIN and other agencies
of the Mexican Government, 28% to the Bank and joint lenders, 25% to foreign
private financial institutions, and 10% to bondholders and suppliers. Details
are in Annex 17, paragraph 12.
6.08      Inadequate control over inventories and the collection of receivables
contributes to the sector's lack of liquidity.
6.09      The sector's inventories increased from Mex$l,616 million on
December 31, 1969, to Mex$2,213 million on September 30, 1971. CFE's divisions
exercise little control, and there is a universal lack of method in inventory
management according to an investigation undertaken by CFE's new Materials
Manager. This is confirmed by the external auditors, who have repeatedly
qualified their opinion on CFE's financial statements regarding inventories
(see Annex 17, paragraph 10). A program has been drawn up for the reduction
in value of inventories by Mex$300 million by September 1972, with a further
reduction of Mex$200 million by March 1973. These reductions are to be achieved
by using older materials in rural installations and reducing the volume of
materials held in stock. The program involves the gradual introduction of
analytical inventory control techniques in the divisions, and of centralized
authorization for any movement of inventories between warehouses. The targets
appear reasonable and the implementation of this program was agreed upon
during negotiations.



- 20 -
6.10      The sector's receivables for electricity sales (see Annex 17,
paragraph 8) increased from Mex$896 million or 60 days' sales, on December 31,
1969, to Mex$1,130 million  or 70 days' sales, on September 30, 1971, when
governmental and private consumers' accounts more than three months overdue
exceeded Mex$200 million. CFE has drawn up a program to improve collections
and to write-off uncollectable accounts. During negotiations CFE agreed to
implement this program and to submit quarterly reports which will allow the
Bank to monitor its implementation.
Tariffs
6.11      The guarantee agreement for Loan 659-ME stipulates that the sector
shall earn a return of 8% on the rate base, consisting essentially of net
fixed assets in operation (Annex 17, paragraph 7). At the time that loan
was appraised, a return of 8% was chosen to enable the sector to make a con-
tribution of about 35% towards financing future construction, but although
the sector has met this covenant, less than 5% of the sector's developnent
was financed by net internal resources in the period 1970-1971. If tariffs
are not increased this year, debt service will exceed net internal resources
by about Mex$160 million.
6.12      Since it is not feasible to reduce the power sector's debt service
burden in the short run, the Government's only option is to resolve the
sector's financial difficulties by increasing tariffs, which have not changed
since 1962. The study group on energy policy recommended in November 1971:
(i) an electricity tariff increase, yielding 17.5% more gross revenue, on
average, per kWh and (ii) a 50% increase in fuel prices, including the fuels
used by the power sector.
6.13      During negotiations it was agreed that the loan will not become
effective until a tariff increase yielding at least 171  more revenue is
introduced. The amount and timing are not yet definite, but the increase is
to take place by the end of 1972. The covenant requiring an 8% rate of
return is to remain in force; however, it was agreed that the sector will
contribute, out of internal resources, at least 18% of the sector's invest-
ment in 1973 and 25% in the subsequent years. If tariffs are increased
1719 on January 1, 1973, labor costs rise by 9% annually and fuel prices go
up 50% on July 1, 1973, the sector's contribution to investment out of internal
resources will be 18% in 1973, 21% in 1974, 12% in 1975 and 24% in 1976. A
further tariff increase would then be necessary in 1974 for the sector to
meet the contribution covenant. In May 1972 CFE submitted to Secretaria de
Industria y Comercio an application for a 224 tariff increase by January 1,
1973, based on the assumptions that (i) fuel costs would increase by 50%
on January 1, 1973, and (ii) labor costs would rise by 12% per year.  The
financial projections set out in Annexes 14 to 16 are based on those assumptions.
According to the projections, the sector's expected contribution to invest-
ment out of net internal resources is 20% in 1973, 26% in 1974, 21% in 1975
and 32% in 1976. Thus the sector would comply with the contribution covenant
provided some of the 1975 debt service peak can be spread into 1976.



- 21 -
6.14      Average revenue from each category of consumers and the distribution
of sales between such categories have been stable since 1966 (Annex 4).
Overall average revenue is about Mex$0.28 (US02.24) per kWh. Large industrial
concerns are substantial consumers, and some of them receive special con-
cessions instead of being billed at the standard industrial rate; the number
of these special contracts, which now account for 14% of sales but only 5.5%
of total revenues, increased sharply, frmn 68 in 1969 to 1,404 in 1970. CFE,
in its application to the Secretaria de Industria y Comercio, proposes sub-
stantial increases in the rates for large residential and coamercial consumers,
moderate increases for industrial consumers and slight reductions for small
consumers. It is also proposed to reduce the number of special contracts
to about twenty-five.
Financing Plan
6.15      The sector's projected sources and applications of funds for the
years 1972-1976 are shown in Annex 16. Expenditure on construction during
the three-year period 1972-1974 is estimated at US$1,368 million (Annex 8). Fi-
nancing thereof by borrowing is projected to decrease from 87% in 1970-1971
to 70% in 1972-1974. This is still high, but is probably the best that can
be expected until the sector succeeds in reducing its medium-term debt. The
terms of the proposed Bank loan of US$125 million have been assumed to be
7.25% over 20 years, including 5 years of grace. In addition to rolling over
US$208 million of Eurobonds and medium-term loans from foreign commercial banks
the sector will need to borrow US$632 million: It is projected that the sector
will obtain US$85 million in joint and parallel loans from the major supplier
countries; there should not be undue difficulties in raising supplier's credits
Us$69 million) and local funds (US$282 million); the remaining funds required
to complete the financing plan comprise additional Eurobond issues of US$12
million) as well as Us$184 iillim i in the form of fresh borrowings Trom foreign
commercial banks normally for terms of 5 to 10 years at 1¼% to 1½ per ,mtage
points above the London six months' interbank rate for Eurodollars. YThe plan
for financing is swuuarised as follows:
1/ Interest rates on these loans are usually revised every six months. Major
fluctuations in the Eurodollar rate, which is currently about 6%, could be
an important factor in the sector's future finances.

6.16      Whether or not the whole financial plan can be successfully
negotiated will depend largely upon the state of foreign money markets and
the credit standing of CFE and of the Mexican Government. The standard
guarantee will therefore be required so that in case of difficulties in
obtaining the projected funds, the Government will arrange for surh funds
to be made available to CFE on terms satisfactory to the Bank. The terms
of the sector's existing and proposed borrowings are stated in Annex 17,
paragraphs 12 through 20.
6.17      As mentioned in paragraphs l.04 and 1.05 a change is expected from
the existing joint financing to parallel financing during 1972 besause the
United States declined to extend the present arrangenents. During 1972 CFE
expects to initiate a procedure for obtaining parallel financing from equip-
ment-supplying countries and to continue to receive financing from joint
lenders to cover the balance of their 50% share of contracts awarde,d under
Loan 659-ME. About US$35 million of the Bank's share of these ordocrs will
still remain unpaid when that loan is fully disbursed. The Bank Nmld meet
its 50% share of such outstanding contracts as a first call on the proceeds
of the proposed loan.
Fi.nancial Forecast
6.18      Projected income statements for 1972-1976 are shown in Annex 15.
A tariff increase of 22.5% and a simultaneous 50% fuel price increase have
been assumed on January 1, 1973. As already mentioned in paragraph 6.13
the projections also assume that the annual increase in labor costs, which
account for about half of operating expenses, will not exceed 9% in 1972,
and 12% in 1973-1976. This rate of increase is higher than the 9% experienced
in 1971 but lower than the 15% increase of 1970.
6.19      As a result of increased internal cash generation, the projected
balance sheets and sources and application of funds (Annexes 14 and 16) show
some improvement in the sector's finances after 1972. Annual debt service
coverage is projected to increase from 0.9 times in 1972 to 1.4 in 1973.
The proportion of the construction program financed by borrowing is expected
to decline from 94% in 1972 to 60% in 1976. Medium-term borrowing from
foreign private institutions is assumed to decline from Mex$1.3 billion
(US$104 million) in 1972 to Mex$650 million (US$52 million) in 1976 (see
Annex 17, paragraph 19). However, even if financing is successfully negotiated
as planned, the sector will continue to carry a very heavy burden of debt,
largely as a result of the high cost of local borrowing (5-10 year loans at
12-14%).

7,   AGREEMENTS REACHED AND RECOMNENDATION
7.01      During negotiations, the following principal agreements were
reached:
(a)  CFE will implement a computerized control system for the sector's
investment program and budget (paragraph 3.09);
(b) CFE's planning department assisted by consultants will study
and implement a system for the long-term planning of the sector's
generation and transmission facilities (paragraph 3.12);
(c) the Government and the sector will start implementing frequency
unification on the basis of an agreed timetable (paragraph 4.03);
(d)  the sector will carry out a study of the replacement value of
its fixed assets; if these are undervalued, the sector and the
Bank will discuss procedures to revalue them (paragraph 6.06);
(e) the Government will allow the sector to set power rates at such
levels that the sector's net internal resources (excluding con-
tributionsfrom Government, States, and consumers) contributes
18% to investment in 1973 and 25% in following years (paragraph
6.13);
7.02      It has been agreed that the evidence required to make the proposed
loan effective will not be submitted to the Bank unless average power rates
are increased by at least 17.5% not later than December 31, 1972 (paragraph
6.13).
7.03      With these agreements ;a power sector program provides a suitable
basis for a Bank loan of US$12' million equivalent for a term of 20 years
including a 5-year grace period.

ANNEX 7
MEXICO
Village Electrification
1.        OFE defines village electrification as the electrification of
population centers of less than 2,500 inhabitants. CFE is in charge of village
electrification in Mexico through its "Departamento de Juntas de Electrifi-
cacion", which is a section of its organization. This section carries out
its program in cooperation with the "Juntas de Electrificacion" of the states
of the Republic.
2.        CFE started the National Rural Electrification Program in 1952.  By
1970 it had brought electricity to over 10,000 population centers with nearly
10 million inhabitants (about 53% of the rural population) at a cost of about
US$200 million equivalent. The states financed about 25% of this amount
through contributions to CFE. In recent years the states' percentage has
increased and reached 33% in 1971. CFE expects it to continue at this level.
3.        CFE allocates funds to the different state juntas on the basis of
(i) a qualitative judgement of the regions where the return on investment is
highest and (ii) social and political considerations. Within each state the
funds are allocated to the various projects essentially on a least cost per
consumer basis, which is acceptable.
4.        In early 1971, the President of the Republic approved a program which,
during his 1971-1976 presidential term, would bring electricity to 9,000 more
villages with 5.3 million inhabitants. This program would cost about US$170
million equivalent.  However, in the course of the latest revision of CFE's
investment program, technical officers of the Secretariat of the Presidency and
CFE reduced the allocation to US$92 million of which UJS$42 million would be
invested in 1971 and 1972. This reduced program would brin- electricity to
3,400 villages with about 3.0 million inhabitants. Pressure from other narts of
the Government and the States may induce CFE to carry out more of the program
than it presently plans. However, the cost of the program would not in any year
exceed 7% of the sector's investment.

1/  Growth rates are negative for the periods prior to 1975 because the
number of isolated small systems decreases due to interconnections;
the systems still isolated by about 1975 are likely to remain so                           H
for some time because they are too remote to be interconnected with
large systems in the short run.

INTERNAL ECONOMIC RETURN
The internal economic return of the Project han  been taken as
the 'liscount rate which equalizes the costs and revenues attributable to
the Project over its economic life, which has been taken as 30 years.  The
Project under consideration is the 1972-1974 time-slice of the investment
program for the Mexican power sector. Within this time-slice there will
be a cross-section of plants. For some plants the investment included in
the time-slice will be the final installment of the total investment for
that plant, whilst for some other plants the exact opposite will apply,
i.e., the investment included in the time-slice will be only the initial
installment of the total investment for that plant. Mostly there will be
plants in between these two extremes. For the purpose of this calculation,
due to the magnitude of the uncertainties involved in doing it any other
way, it has been assumed that the opposing effects on the internal economic
return of the time-slice due to the two extreme cases mentioned above, will
cancel each other out, and that the investment containea in the 1972-1974
time-slice can be treated as though it corresponds to plant whose invest-
ments are started and completed within the period 1972-1974.
On a mixed hydro-thermal generating system, such as the system
being considered here, generating plants are installed within a least-
cost strategy (paragraphs 5.04 and 5.05) at a point in time to meet the
maximum system demand with adequate provision for reserves in plant capaci-
ty and electrical energy requirements. Once new generating plant is in-
stalled it will be operated to minimize the annual system total (fuel plus
other) operating costs consistent with meeting the consumers requirements
for electricity. New hydro-electric plant (up to the limit of its total
electrical energy generating potential) and new thermal plant which has a
lower total operating cost per kWh of electrical energy produced than
some existing plant, will both make a savings in the total system operat-
ing cost in that existing plant will operate fewer hours in the year. Thus,
besides contributing towards meeting an increase in the system requirements
for meeting electrical energy, once a new generating plant is installed, it
will very often enable existing plant to be operated few hours in any year.
The multiple effect that installing the new plant has on the system ("system
with new plant" case ) is (a) the annual additional investment costs of the
new plant, (b) the annual additional operating costs of the new planl, (c)
the annual savings in operating costs of the existing plant and (d) the
annual increase in system sales (kWh) and therefore revenues; all compared
with not installing the new plant ("system without new plant" case).
Analogous cases to the above can be made with respect to new trano-
mission and distribution plant and to a nrw time-slice of generation, trans-
mission and distribution plant.



ANNEX 13
Page 2 of 2 pages
The calculation of the internal economic return of the 1972-1974
time-slice of the development program for the Mexican power sector is a
"with the time-slice" compared to "without the time-slice" type of calcula-
tion and therefore must incorporate the four elements mentioned at the end
of the last paragraph but one. The time stream of these elements has been
taken over the lifetime of the project. However, the effect of decisions
about future time-slices in the development program upon the time-slice
presently being considered is highly conjectural at this stage. Decisions
concerning the installation and choice between future time-slices will take
into consideration the existence of the time-slice presently being consider-
ed. Meanwhile, for the exercise of calculating the internal economic re-
turn of the presently considered time-slice, the figures for the four ele-
ments (less the capital cost element) mentioned earlier in this paragraph
for 1974 have been used for the rest of the life of the time-slice.
lth these assumptions, the internal economic return was calculat-
ed to be about 14%. If revenues were increased or decreased by 10%, the
return would increase or decrease by about 2.6 Percentage points. If the
costs of the program were increased or decreased by 10%, the return would
increase or decrease by about 1.9 percentage points.
Shadow prices for fuel were not used because the future fuel price
assumed for these computations appeared to be reasonably near the economic
equilibrium value. Labor shadow costs would have been lower than actual
costs for unskilled labor and higher for skilled labor. These differences
were likely to compensate for one another within the margin of error of the
calculations. No shadow price was given to foreign exchange.

Notes on Financial Statements
Revenues
1.        Estimates for 1971 are based on actual results through September.
2.        Power revenues are mainly derived from sales of electricity and
the po-er consumption tax, which is a surcharge presently levied on all
power saLes, mining and public lighting excepte, at a rate of i5% for large
commercial anri industrial loadsand 10% for othiers. By law, the proceeds
of this tax are invested in CFE's equity and they can therefore be consiaered
as a part of the sector's revenues.
3.        Projected revenue is based on the forecast of sales discussed
in paragraph 5.02 of the report and the assumed 1710 tariff increase. The
decline in average revenue per kWh from 0.324 in 1973 to 0.321 in 1976 is
due to the increase expected in the proportion of sales to industry. (See Annex 4).
4.        Other operating revenues are minor.  Tney are derived from sales
of water (Tijuana desalination plant) and gas (Konterrey).
Fixed Assets and Depreciation
5.        Fixed assets are valued at cost expressed in NIexican pesos less
straight-line depreciation. Their estimated useful lives are quite long,
especially wizen compared with normal practice in othler developing countries.
As a result, depreciation charges for the sector averaged only 2.24% of
gross fixed assets in 1970.  Sensitivity analysis has shown, Inowever, that
a reduction in the lives of fixed assets would hiave only a marginal effect
on the rate of return over the nextfEve years if accumulated depreciation
were adjusted in th.e same proportion to reflect insufficient charges in
prior years. If the sectorts net fixed assets as of the end of 1972 were
revalued by 20%, the rate of return on the sector's rate base would be
as follow,:
1973     1974     1975    1976
Return on rate base (,)
Revalued                                     9.07    10.21    10.87   11.15
Without revaluation                        114.3    12.49    12.88   12.96
Interest Charges
6.        Interest payable is net of trhe portiorn of interest on acquisition
debt that is paid by the Government (see paragraplh 12 belowv) (in MIex$ million):

ANNEX 17
Page 2 of 10 pages
Interest during construction is based on the average cost of borrowing applied
to the average value of work in progress.
Rate Base and Revenue Requirement
7.        The rate base is defined in the Guarantee Agreement for Loan 659-I4E
as tihe sectorts net fixed assets in operation at the beginning of the year,
increased by a notional 4% to allow for completion of plant during the year.
Should operating income fail to produce a rate of return of at least 8% on
this rate base in any given year, the shortfall can be deducted from accumu-
lated excess funds or made up in the following year. Accumulatsd funds are
the difference between earnings in excess of 8% in preoious years and acqui-
sition debt service (see paragraph 13 below).
Current Assets
Accounts Receivable
8.        On September 30, 1971 accounts receivabls from the public and
Government for power sales totalled Mex$1.1 billion.  Of these, 63.8% were
less than 30 days old, 11.5% betwseen 31 to 60 days, 5.9% between 61 and
90 days, and 18.8% over 90 days old.
9.        Other receivables for the sector included loans made by CFE for
various purposes, such as financing of suppliers, sales of appliances to
rural consumers, advances to employees and trade unions, etc. totalling
about Mex$0.5 billion on September 30, 1971.  It is doubtful whether all
of the latter are really current assets. Some are obviously more in the
nature of investments; others may be difficult to collect.
Inventories
10.       The external auditors have repeatedly qualified their opinior. of
CFE's financial statements, claiming they were not able to verify CFE's
materials and supplies inventory accounts because of the absence of
necessary records and control procedures. CFE's internal auditors have
also frequently complained of difficulties in the audit of warehouses,
due to transactions being recorded late or not at all, and general lack
of organization.
Other Assets
11.       This account is principally composed of loans to employees for
housing and other purchases wtLich are required under CFE's and Centro's
labor contracts (l4ex$986 million in 1970).  The balance consists of other
investments (iMe:l102 million in 1970), deferred expenses (1Ix$92 million
in 1970) and suspense accounts (Mex$371 million in 1970) containing debits
not yet fully processed through the accounting system. The latter figure
was close to that for 1969, and it is probably inevitable in a highly
decentralized accounting system like CFE's in which each division keeps
separate accounts.

Long-Term Debt
12.       The tableson the next 3 pages are a list of the sector's debt
on December 31, 1970 with original maturity of over one year. It is broken
down into the categories defined in the Loan Agreement for Loan 659-14E:
a.   Acquisition debt, i.e. debt incurred to purchase the assets
of entities included in the power sector.
b.   Medium-term debt, i.e. debt having an original maturity of up
to five years, not included in a.
c.   Other debt having an original maturity of ma e than one year.
The sum of b and c is referred to as "consolidated debt".

ANNEX 17
Page 7 of 10 pages
13.       In connection with Loans 544-ME and 659-ME it was agreed that
acquisition debt may only be serviced from excess funds set aside if the
rate of return of the sector is higher than 8%. At the end of 1970 excess
funds were stated by CFE to be Mex$72h.5 million.  However, the figure
actually may be less than Mex$300 million according to the Bank's latest
calculations. Included in acquisition debt are two NAFIN loans totalling
Mex$1.3 billion obtained to finance assets owned until 1960 by the American
and Foreign Power Company (A&FP). They are repayable over a period of
twenty years beginning in 1973. Interesthat the rate of 8% is paid by the
Government. In 1978 CFE will review with the Government whether it will
be able to reimburse the interest paymentg on a long-term basis.
14.       The debt limitation covenant for Loan 659-ME is unusually complex.
It replaced a conventional borrowing test covenant in previous loans,
providing for debt-service coverage of at least 1.4 times, a test that the
sector had consistently failed to meet. The new covenant provides that
the sector will not incur debt without the agreement of the Bank if:
a.   net income before interest is less than 1.6 times maximum
interest on consolidated debt (see paragraph 12 (c)) in any
succeeding year; or
b.   the sum of net fixed plant in operation and work in progress
is less than 1.5 times the consolidated debt; or
c.   medium-term debt (see paragraph 12 (b)) is more than one-tenth
of the sum of net fixed plant in operation and work in progress.
15.       The sector has had little difficulty in complying with the second
and the third of the above tests. The ratio of net fixed assets to
consolidated debt at the end of 1971 was about 1.9 times, and medium-term
debt was about 9.6% of net fixed assets. The definition of medium-term
debt though rather artificial, was useful in the sector's negotiations
with lenders, who were persuaded to increase the maturity of their loans
from 3-5 years to 6-8 years.
16.       The very high cost of local borrowing (the nominal rate of about
12% is increased by various discounts and commissions by up to 2%) and the
sharp increase during the 1969-1971 monetary cTisis of the short-term rates
on which many of the sectorts foreign lenders base their interest charges,l/
have resulted in a rapid rise in the sector's interest costs: from Mex$800
million in 1967 and to mIex$1.4 billion in 1971. Coverage of interest by
net income before interest has declined steadily,and the sector is presently
unable to meet the first of the tests described in paragraph 14.

NAFIN Refinancing
20.       In connection with Loan 659-ME, N-AFIT  and the Government agreed to,-
assist the sector in refinancing about Mex$2.1 billion of 1970-1974 maturities
on the sector's debt to NAFIN.  This has now been done, but the resulting
lightening of the sector's debt service burdern has been less than expected.
The high (11.25%) interest charged by NAFIN offsets to a considerable degree
the positive effect of stretching out repayments over a twenty-year period.
Amortization payments in 1972-1974 are net of the following amounts agreed to
by refinanced by NAFIN (in Mex$ million):

Other Liabilities
21.       This account includes mainly the pension reserve, which is credited
with the difference between actual pension and severance payments and the
corresponding charges to income. The latter are equal in each year to one-
tenth of the estimated payments over the next ten years.
