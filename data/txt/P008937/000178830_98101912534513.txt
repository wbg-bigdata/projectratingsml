I. INTRODUCTION
1.01      The Government of Turkey has requested a Bank loan of US$110 millic7
to finance the Fertilizer Industry Rationalization and Energy Saving Project
(the Project). The Project has four components: (i) improvements at the
Kutahya II and Samsun plants of Azot Sanayii T.A.S. (AZOT), the Tutunciftlik
plant of Istanbul Gubre Sanayii A.S. (IGSAS), and the Yarimca plant of Gubre
Fabrikalari T.A.S. (GUBRE); (ii) expansion of training facilities of AZOT and
IGSAS; (iii) technical/management services to improve corporate and plant
level management; and (iv) consulting services for a Fertilizer Marketing and
Pricing Study. The Project is expected to increase annual fertilizer produc-
tion by about 623,000 product tons which at 1980 prices is worth about US$168
million.
1.02      In the case of Kutahya II, Samsun and Yarimca, the Project aims
principally at rationalizing existing operations to remove capacity-limiting
bottlenecks. In addition, one new sulfuric acid plant will be established at
Yarimca to substitute sulfuric acid imports. This plant will be initially
based on imported sulfur but could be converted in the future to use local
pyrites if and when pyrites of the required quality become available in
adequate quantity. In the case of IGSAS, the main objective is to reduce the
consumption of naphtha (as feedstock) and fuel oil (used for steam generation
in boilers) by substantial substitution of platformer gas and refinery off-gas
for naphtha feedstock and fuel respectively from the adjacent IPRAS refinery,
which has been expanded since the Bank-financed IGSAS plant was completed at
the end of 1977. As naphtha and fuel oil prices have increased steeply since
the 1973 world oil crisis and as refinery gas production has increased, it has
become economically attractive to carry out the above-mentioned switch-over.
The total financing required for the Project is estimated at US$236.6 million
including US$131 million in foreign exchange.
1.03      The proposed Bank loan of US$110 million includes US$105.6 million
for improving the operation of the four plants and the remaining US$4.4
million for the other three Project components. The technical/management
services component of the Project aims at upgrading the financial management
and accounting systems as well as improving the corporate level management,
mainly of AZOT. The Fertilizer Marketing and Pricing Study will analyze the
existing system to identify the measures needed to improve the efficiency of
fertilizer marketing in Turkey. The Training Program will expand training
at the plant and headquarters level supplemented by training of selected
personnel abroad.
1.04      The proposed loan will be the second Bank operation in the fertilizer
sector in Turkey. The first loan (US$24 million) followed by a supplemental
Loan (US$18 million) was for the IGSAS Fertilizer Project (Reports No. P-1062,
of April 28, 1972 and P-1600-TU, of April 2, 1975) which was commissioned in
1978 and last year (1980) was operating at 84% capacity.
1.05      The Project was preappraised in  March/April 1980 following prepara-
tion of project reports by the companies concerned. As the mission identified
the need for additional project preparation to carry out the appraisal, the
Government requested and the Bank agreed to provide US$600,000 in June 1980
from the Project Preparation Facility to complete project preparation using
foreign consulting firms. These firns carried out a substantial amount of
preliminary engineering to define the scope of the Project and enable the
preparation of adequate capital cost estimates. Following completion of
studies by those firms, the appraisal was carried out in December 1980 by a
mission consisting of Messrs. Y. T. Shetty (Chief), L. Borin, and R. Bhan of
the Industrial Projects Department and Mr. T. Ogmen (Consultant).

II. THE INDUSTRIAL SECTOR AND FERTILIZER INDUSTRY
A.   Industrial Sector
2.01      During 1950-1977, the Turkish economy grew at an impressive pace and
underwent marked transformation. As a result of the country-s strong commit-
ment to growth and modernization, the Gross Domestic Product (GDP) rose, on
average, by more than 6% a year. Rapid industrialization led to substantial
changes in the structure of the economy: the share of industry in GDP in-
creased from 10% to 23% while the share of agriculture declined from 52% to
21% during the same period. However, the striking economic progress had been
punctuated (in 1958, 1970 and 1977) by severe balance of payments crises,
mainly because of Turkey's inability to develop a strong export base coupled
with heavy debt service on foreign borrowings, mostly short and medium term.
Particularly, the economic crisis which started in mid-1977 proved a serious
one. Real GDP increased 3.1% in 1978, stagnated in 1979, and increased by
only 1.5% in 1980.
2.02      Turkey's planned development strategy has given high priority to
industrialization and the development of the regions outside the major urban
centers. The Government promoted industrial investment in priority industries
through incentives including investment allowance, tax and tariff exemptions
or deferment. As a result of these incentives, supplemented by protection
against competition from imports, Turkey had achieved a high level of invest-
ment in industry and, during the last three Five-Year Plans (1963-77),
industrial output grew at an annual average rate of about 10%. Due to the
economic crisis during 1977-80, industrial output grew at an annual rate of
only 3%. Textiles, iron and steel, fertilizers, chemicals, paper, sugar,
cement, plastic and machinery have been the main growth industries. Industry
now accounts for about 13% of the total employment in the country.
2.03      Under the Turkish system, the State Economic Enterprises (SEEs)
play an important role in industrialization. In addition to SEEs, the
public sector consists of a few autonomous companies which are indirectly
owned by the Government but run largely along lines of private sector com-
panies. Public sector companies aim to invest mostly in projects of national
importance and in projects normally not taken up by the private sector due to
size, profit and/or risk considerations. The present Government is shifting
emphasis away from the public sector towards a more market-oriented economy.
The private sector is being encouraged in many fields, and foreign investments
are now being actively encouraged, especially when they introduce new and
advanced technology, help with energy problems, or promote exports.
2.04      Operational SEEs today account for about half of the country-s
production in mining and manufacturing. A number of problems are affecting
them in varying degrees. They include frequent changes in management, over-
staffing, low salary scales, high turnover of experienced staff, lack of
imported materials, slow application of modern business practices, and
lack of cost control systems. Some of these problems arise from the Govern-
ment-s use of the SEEs to achieve various social objectives such as the
development of backward areas, the provision of employment and the sale of
essential goods at low prices; others are largely due to administrative
inefficiencies.



2.05      Reform of SEEs--in organization, management and manpower develop-
ment--remains crucial for improvement in the performance of SEEs.  Over
the years, SEEs have earned low profits, necessitating increasing budgetary
transfers to meet their current and investment needs.  Especially since 1973,
there has been a serious deterioration in the financial situation of SEEs.
Successive governments, in an effort to slow down inflation, held SEEs  price
increases below the rate at which costs were rising, while, at the same
time, the scale of their investment was increasing sharply. The net effect
was a very rapid widening of the gap between SEEs savings and investment.
With the substantial budgetary allocations required for SEEs, the overall
public sector def cit rose from TL 13.5 billion in 1974 to TL 395.8 billion
in 1980. Most of this increased deficit was financed by borrowing from the
Central Bank. This situation, combined with cost-push factors such as the
powerful labor movement, the farmer-oriented agricultural price support policy
and, above all, excess demand put an upward pressure on the country-s price
levels, with inflation reaching a rate of about 100% in 1980.
2.06      In January 1980, Turkey adopted a Stabilization Program which
included a move toward a more market-oriented system for SEEs, introduction of
a crawling peg exchange rate system, raising of interest rates to i-nduce
savings, increasing ex-factory prices of SEE products to international levels,
and reducing SEE access to the budget. Now further measures are being pursued
including removing SEE management from political interference, restricting
hiring of personnel in public enterprises which are overmanned, raising
professional and managerial salaries to more competitive levels, and further
reduction in public subsidies. Progress made under these measures is monitored
under the Structural Adjustment lending to Turkey.
B.   Fertilizer Industry
2.07      Turkey's fertilizer production started in 1939 on a small scale
at Karabuk Iron and Steel Works with the production of ammonium sulfate as a
by-product based on coke oven gas. Seventeen other plants by ten different
companies have since then been set up, including the Tutunciftlik ammonia/urea
project of IGSAS financed by the Bank (Map IBRD-13625R). There are six
companies producing exclusively fertilizers. Of these, two--AZOT and IGSAS--
are in the public sector and operate seven plants; two--Gubre Fabrikalari and
Akdeniz Gubre--are in the joint sector and operate four plants; and two--Bagfas
and Ege Gubre--are in the private sector and operate three plants. In addition,
three public sector companies--a petrochemical company (Petkim) and two steel
companies (Karabuk and Isdemir)--are producing ammonium sulfate fertilizer as
a by-product in three plants. A new company, Toros Gubre, in the private
sector in expected to start fertilizer production in 1981.
2.08      The various operating plants, their annual capacities and recent
production are given in Annex 2. The total annual capacity of the plants is
about 5 million product tons equivalent to nearly one million tons of nitrogen
(N) and 850,000 tons of phosphorus (P) nutrients. The public sector companies
account for 47% of total fertilizer capacity; the joint sector accounts for
27%; and the private companies for the remaining 26%. The following table
summarizes the trend of capacity utilization during 1976-80 by the operating
companies:

a/   Weighted average.
2.09      In 1980, the average capacity utilization in the fertilizer industry
was 53% for N and 45% for P. Low capacity utilization is mainly due to the
following factors: (i) technical bottlenecks arising from design deficiencies
and poor maintenance; (ii) inadequate availability of imported raw materials,
intermediate products and spare parts; (iii) deficiencies in the supply of
local raw materials and utilities (poor and uneven quality and unreliable
supply of lignite, pyrites, rock phosphate, etc., and power and water short-
ages); (iv) working capital problems; (v) organization and management defi-
ciencies; and (vi) lack of trained manpower. The Project is part of Turkey's
efforts for overcoming technical bottlenecks, power and water shortages, and
organizational and manpower problems. Together with it, the Government is
giving priority in the allocation of foreign exchange to fertilizer inputs
rather than finished product imports. This import program is supported by the
Bank's structural adjustment lending.
2.10      To alleviate local raw material and utility supply problems, the
Government is now giving more attention to coordination between fertilizer
producers and their raw material suppliers to improve the quality and quantity
of local raw materials. Furthermore, fertilizer producers are planning to
install facilities at the plants to handle and use the raw materials of poor
and uneven quality (e.g., facilities for mixing low, medium and high quality
lignite at plant site; facilities for drying pyrites before use; facilities to
grind rock before use, etc.). One of the projects being considered for
financing in FY1981 under a separate Bank operation (through the State
Investment Bank, DYB) will increase raw material supply to the existing copper
smelters in Turkey, helping them to produce more copper as well as by-product
flotation pyrites and sulfuric acid which are used for the production of
phosphatic fertilizers. Under the Project, a sulfur burner will be installed
at the pyrites-based Samsun sulfuric acid plant to enable it to operate on
sulfur in case it cannot get adequate pyrites of the right quality. The



- 5 -
working capital problem arising from delayed payment from the marketing
organization is being addressed by the Government by increased allocation from
the budget for this purpose.
2.11      Organization and management problems, which are particularly serious
in AZOT, will be dealt with under the Project through the Management Improve-
ment Program and technical assistance for plant operations and maintenance, and
project implementation. The training component will help ease the problem of
trained manpower. Further, in order to facilitate a concerted bid to increase
capacity utilization, agreement has been reached that AZOT will introduce a
control and monitoring system by December 31, 1981 to establish monitorable
efficiency criteria and to review performance against unitwise monthly produc-
tion targets. Such systems are already in operation in IGSAS and GUBRE.
2.12      Of the eighteen fertilizer plants, seven were identified by a Bank
preappraisal mission and the Government as high priority, suitable for possible
Bank financial and technical assistance to remove technical bottlenecks and
improve capacity utilization. Of the remaining plants, some are small and old
operations in which scope for increasing capacity utilization is limited. In
some others, capacity utilization could be increased easily (mainly private
sector companies) if they are provided with adequate foreign exchange to
import raw materials. Further, one of the new plants of AZOT--the calcium
ammonium nitrate plant at Gemlik--was not included as it is still within the
guarantee period and the engineering firms which built it are trying to
resolve its technical problems. AZOT is currently building at Gemlik a 1,000
tpd ammonia plant with US$41.5 million buyers- credit from the U.K. and
France. Work on this plant started in 1977 and almost all the equipment is at
site ready for erection. Meanwhile, naphtha-based ammonia plants in general
have become uneconomic because of sharp increases in world naphtha prices.
AZOT has already invested US$90 million equivalent on this plant and needs
another US$40-50 million to complete it. It has been agreed with the Govern-
ment and AZOT that AZOT will prepare and furnish to the Bank a report on the
Gemlik ammonia plant after reviewing: (i) its economics in the context of
sunk cost and additional investment needs, and (ii) the possibility of modify-
ing the plant to use other feedstocks. The study will also confirm that the
additional investment required for the Gemlik plant will not impair AZOT's
ability to carry out its obligations with respect to the Project.
2.13      As noted previously, the Bank provided US$600,000 from the Project
Preparation Facility (PPF) in June 1980 to the Government to complete the
preparation of the seven fertilizer sub-projects identified by the Government
and preappraisal mission for rehabilitation. Four engineering firms--Krupp-
Koppers, Uhde and Davy International (Federal Republic of Germany, F.R.G.),
and Heurtey (France) were subsequently hired to complete the preparation of
those projects. Though the preparation covered seven fertilizer projects, it
was agreed with the Government that their rehabilitation would have to be
carried out in two phases, as the task is complex and foreign exchange funds
required far exceed the amount the Bank can make available for this purpose at
this time. Accordingly, four projects have been selected for inclusion under
Phase I, based on their priority in terms of local resource use, energy
savings and other economic priorities. Based on the above criteria, Kutahya
II and Samsun (of AZOT), Tutunciftlik (of IGSAS), and Yarimca (of GUBRE) have
been selected for inclusion under Phase I; Mersin (of Akdeniz), Iskenderun (of
Gubre Fabrikalari) and Foca (of Ege Gubre) would be included under Phase II
which is expected to be implemented starting from 1982/83. Further, the new



- 6 -
sulfuric acid plant proposed at Samsun would be postponed to Phase II as the
foreign exchange funds available at present are not adequate to include it
under Phase I. The Government gives high priority to the implementation of
both phases to increase local fertilizer production and decrease fertilizer
imports which cost US$483 million in 1980.
C.   Raw Material Base
2.14      Turkey depends heavily on imported raw materials--including hydro-
carbon products, rock phosphate and sulphur--for its fertilizer production
as the known local resources are limited and mostly of poor quality. As a
result, during 1979 and 1980, the country imported US$236 million worth
of materials for fertilizer production.
2.15      Hydrocarbon Feedstocks:  Oil derivatives (naphtha and fuel oil) and
natural gas are the usual sources of hydrocarbon feedstocks for nitrogenous
(N) fertilizer production. Turkey's domestic crude oil production of about
2.5 million tons accounts for hardly one-fifth of its annual consumption.
This leads to direct and indirect imports of the main inputs for N fertilizer
production. Reserves of natural gas, the most efficient feedstock for N
production, have been found recently at Thrace in the northwest and at Camurlu
and Dodan in the southeast (MAP, IBRD-13625R). However, it will take some
time before adequate drilling is done, and reliable estimates of proven gas
reserves and their composition are available. Currently, the country relies
mostly on oil-based hydrocarbon inputs (naphtha and fuel oil) from the
refining of imported crude oil, and on imported ammonia for the production of
N fertilizers. In recent years, Turkey has been importing 100,000-150,000
tons of ammonia annually.
2.16      Aware of its lack of oil-based hydrocarbons, Turkey is seeking to
base its future ammonia production partly on its extensive lignite (brown
coal) deposits estimated at about 6 billion tons. AZOT has, therefore,
developed plans to establish a lignite-based ammonia/urea plant at Soma. AZOT
already has two lignite-based ammonia plants in operation, but one (Kutahya
I) is small in size, and the second (Kutahya II), though of a larger size, has
not been operating well because of technical and operational problems.
2.17      Rock Phosphate:  Turkey has phosphate rock deposits in Mazidagi,
Aydin-Mugla, and some other regions; but so far only limited geological,
mining and beneficiation tests have been conducted. The Elazig plant of AZOT,
built to operate on local phosphate rock, has encountered mechanical difficul-
ties in its use.  Most of Turkish phosphate deposits are low in phosphorus (P)
content and also contain carbonates which have to be calcined before they
could be used in phosphatic fertilizer production. Further, most of the
deposits are located in remote regions with limited transportation infrastruc-
ture. As a result, about 80% of total phosphate fertilizer production is
currently based on imported phosphate rock. The Bank is discussing with the
Turkish authorities the prospects for exploring and exploiting local rock
phosphate deposits.
2.18      Sulfur:  Due to its relatively small deposits and the small pro-
duction of sulfur as a by-product of oil refinery operations, Turkey can meet
only a minor portion of its sulfur requirements for fertilizer production.
However, Turkey has large deposits of pyrites (iron sulfide), often along with
copper pyrites, though they are not as economical or easy to use as sulfur in
the production of sulfuric acid. Many of the existing sulfuric acid plants of



fertilizer companies based on local pyrites are experiencing technical
problems, mostly due to the poor quality and high moisture of pyrites.
2.19      In the long term, as technology further develops, prospects are good
for Turkey to maximize the use of local materials such as lignite and pyrites.
In addition, oil and gas exploration efforts have been stepped up to increase
hydrocarbon production. In the short and medium term, the country is planning
to resort to other materials, in particular to substitute naphtha with refinery
gases and to increase sulfuric acid production based on imported sulfur while
increasing the production of local pyrites. Sulfur-based sulfuric acid plants
could be modifie-` for the use of pyrites when adequate local pyrites become
available.
III. THE COMPANIES
3.01      The Fertilizer Industry Rationalization and Energy Saving Project
includes three companies--AZOT, IGSAS and GUBRE, which account for about 56% of
Turkey-s production capacity. AZOT and IGSAS are in the public sector whereas
GUBRE is a joint sector company with 31% private ownership.
A.   Azot Sanayii T.A.S. (AZOT)
1.   History and Organization
3.02      AZOT was formed in 1954 to build and operate a nitrogenous fertilizer
plant at Kutahya, in central Anatolia, utilizing lignite as its raw material.
The first plant, Kutahya I, was completed and commissioned in 1961. A second
lignite-based fertilizer plant, Kutahya II, was built adjacent to Kutahya I
and was commissioned in 1968. Subsequently, AZOT established a triple super-
phosphate (TSP) plant and a diammonium phosphate (DAP) plant in 1970 and 1974
respectively at Samsun, on the Black Sea Coast in the north. These plants
were followed by a single superphosphate (SSP) plant in 1970 at Elazig, in
Eastern Turkey, and a calcium ammonium nitrate (CAN) plant in 1978 at Gemlik,
on the Marmara Sea Coast. AZOT is now the largest fertilizer company in Turkey
accounting for 33% of the N capacity and 29% of phosphate capacity.
3.03      AZOT was formed initially as a private company according to the
Commercial Code of Turkey. However, the Company is regulated by the laws
applicable to a State Economic Enterprise (SEE), since its entire capital is
provided directly by the Government. This has affected the Company's manage-
ment and decision-making process, resulting in overcentralization of authority
at the corporate and ministry levels (AZOT is under the Ministry of Industry).
3.04      The direction and management of AZOT is exercised by a Board of
Directors. The Chairman and two of its five members are General Manager and
Assistant General Managers of the Company, respectively. The General Manager
is appointed by the Council of Ministers. The Board normally meets every week
to formulate policies and control day-to-day operations of the Company.
3.05      The present General Director of AZOT is capable and experienced.
The plants are managed from the Company's Central Office in Ankara. Despite
the conscientiousness and dedication of its present management, AZOT is not
currently equipped to manage effectively the operation of its units located in



-8-
different parts of the country. While some of the general problems are being
addressed by the Government s proposed SEE reforms, in conjunction with this
Project, AZOT management wishes to improve coordination between the Central
Office and the various plant managements, and to correct, with Bank assistance,
deficiences in a number of critical areas of operation particularly for: (i)
production and maintenance planning; (ii) development of training programs;
(iii) inventory control and management; (iv) organizational structure and
compensation system; and (v) financial management with emphasis on management
information system, capital budgeting, standard costing, and financial plan-
ning. Under the Project, AZOT will engage the services of a competent manage-
ment firm to make a detailed study of the management and operation of the
Company including financial management (terms of reference enclosed as Annex
3-1), and prepare an action program for overcoming the deficiencies. The
short list of firms and the terms of reference for the study have been agreed
with the Bank and the firms will be selected under Bank guidelines not later
than December 31, 1981. The program will be prepared by December 31, 1982 and
implemented in consultation with the Bank by December 31, 1983. Financing for
such a study and its implementation program is included under the Project. In
addition, the Government plans to take steps to enable AZOT to have the
necessary autonomy to effectively manage the operations. In this context,
agreement was reached with the Government and the Company that the Board of
Directors of AZOT will delegate authority and responsibility to the General
Director regarding particularly personnel, investment, contracting and
purchasing matters and he, in turn, will delegate adequate authority and
responsibility to Plant Managers.
2.   Production Performance
3.06      AZOT has six operating plants with a total capacity to produce
306,000 tpy of N and 243,000 tpy of P. The plantwise design capacities
and recent production performance are summarized in the following table:

3.07      While Kutahya I, a small lignite-based plant, is operating at high
capacity, all the other five plants of AZOT are operating at low capac-
ity (7-52%) for reasons mentioned earlier (para 2.09). The lowest capacity
utilization is in the Elazig plant, which is based on local materials (rock
phosphate and sulfuric acid) not available in the required volume and quality;
transportation of imported materials to make up the deficit is not economically



- 9 -
feasible because of the plant-s remote location and the lack of adequate
transport infrastructure. Further, the Gemlik plant is new (commissioned in
1978) and has been experiencing prolonged commissioning problems. The
engineering firm which built the plant is helping to overcome those problems.
A brief description of the Kutahya II and Samsun facilities which are the only
AZOT plants included under the (Phase I) Project, is given below.
3.08      Kutahya II:  The lignite-based Kutahya II plant, commissioned in
1968, consists of a 340 tpd ammonia plant, a 610 tpd nitric acid plant and a
1,026 tpd CAN plant. The plant was engineered and constructed by a consortium
of firms--Krupp-Koppers and Pintch Bamag (FRG) and Kaltenbach (France). They
use the Koppers-Totzek process for lignite gasification, the Casale process
for ammonia synthesis, the Oswald process for nitric acid production and the
Kaltenbach prilling process for CAN production. Lignite is obtained from a
nearby mine at Seyitomer, some 26 km from the site, and transported by rail to
the factory. The other raw material--dolomite--is also obtained locally.
The plant requires approximately 27 MW of power which is obtained from the
national grid. However, interruptions in power supply and voltage fluctua-
tions in the power grid constitute a serious problem at Kutahya. This problem
could be overcome either by installing a direct power line from the Seyitomer
Thermal Plant to Kutahya or by installing a captive power plant at Kutahya.
Agreements have been reached that AZOT will study these alternatives and
submit a report to the Bank by September 30, 1981 on the steps to be taken to
solve the power supply problem along with an implementation schedule and firm
financing arrangements. This will be a condition for disbursement of the loan
portion to AZOT for Kutahya II equipment.
3.09      Following its acceptance tests in 1968, Kutahya II has not been able
to operate at high capacity due to low ammonia production. During the last
four years, capacity utilization has been as follows: 36% in 1977; 46% in
1978; 24% in 1979; and 22% in 1980. The major factor limiting capacity
utilization has been mechanical failures at the ammonia plant arising from
the uneven quality of lignite supplied by the Turkish Coal Company (TKI); the
quality of deliveries while averaging over the year the required specification,
fluctuates frequently, causing operational problems. The plant has also
suffered from poor operation and maintenance practices. In 1980, the plant
was down for about 2,155 hours due to mechanical problems, 315 hours due to
power failures, and 260 hours due to insufficient steam availability. Under
these conditions total production for 1980 was only 84,150 tons of CAN, 25% of
the design capacity. Krupp Koppers have studied the problem of Kutahya and
have prepared a program of investments aimed at overcoming the difficulties
caused by lignite of uneven quality and improving inadequate plant sections
(para 5.03). With these improvements and and proposed measures to solve the
power supply problem (para 3.08), the plant is expected to increase capacity
utilization to 85% by 1987.
3.10      Samsun Plants:  The plants are located some 14 km east of Samsun, on
the Black Sea Coast, next to the copper smelter of Karadeniz Copper Works
(KBI), a public sector undertaking, which supplies by-product sulfuric acid
from the smelter to the fertilizer plant. The Samsun Complex has three
processing plants with the following design characteristics:

The sulfuric acid unit was built by IPRAN (Romania) under the license of Lurgi
and uses the Contact process. Other Samsun I and II facilities were built by
Chemiebau, predecessor of Davy International, using the dihydrite process
for phosphoric acid, and the Olin Mattheisson process for DAP production. The
Complex has a jetty to unload phosphoric rock, but pyrites imported to make up
the deficit in local availability are unloaded at the Samsun harbor and
trucked to the site. Ammonia is imported through the jetty; and sulfuric acid
from the nearby smelter is transported by pipeline. Total power requirement
of the complex is 11.5 MW; of this, 5 MW is obtained from the process and the
rest is purchased from the national grid. Fresh water is obtained mainly from
two sources: wells within a radius of 3 km; and river reservoir, about 5 km
away. Water from these sources is not enough to meet the demand of the
complex especially in summer months. This is one of the bottlenecks limiting
capacity utilization. AZOT will construct as part of the Project a new water
supply line from Yesilirmak river to the site (about 25 km) to increase water
supply to the Samsun plant.
3.11      The capacity utilization in Samsun in recent years is summarized below:

a!   Capacity utilization.
Due to the limited availability of flotation pyrites and sulfuric acid from
the nearby copper smelter of KBI, reliance on the imports of such materials
had to be increased greatly during the period. The KBI sulfuric acid plant
with a rated capacity of about 1,000 tpd is operating only at about 10%
capacity due to:  (i) inadequate local copper ore supply; (ii) low S02
content of gas which is vented to the atmosphere; and (iii) inadequate power
supply. The availability of copper ore is expected to increase in the future,
as the Government has plans to increase production from the copper deposits at
Kure and Cayeli. Samsun's own sulfuric acid production is also low. Since
the existing 650 tpd sulfuric acid plant at the Samsun fertilizer complex is



- 11 -
based on flotation pyrites from the KBI copper smelter, and since the smelter
is operating at low capacity, adequate flotation pyrites are not available to
the Samsun sulfuric acid plant. Imported flotation pyrites from Cyprus are
being used to supplement local supply, but this could meet only part of the
shortfall as the export from Cyprus are declining, and as importation from
other further away places is less economic due to high transportation costs.
Sulfuric acid production at Samsun is further hampered by the high moisture
content of the KBI flotation pyrites, which makes them difficult to screen and
use. A drying system, along with a lump crusher, to dry the flotation pyrites
before screening is necessary at Samsun for efficient use of the pyrites.
Further, the installation of a sulfur burner at Samsun would provide the
flexibility to use sulfur for acid production if adequate flotation pyrites
are not available.
3.12      With these facilities, which are included under the Project, the
Samsun plant can increase its sulfuric acid production to about 160,000 tpy
(compared to the current production of about 37,250 tpy). At the KBI sulfuric
acid plant, sulfuric acid production would increase to 1.40,000 tpy or more if
the copper ore supply is increased to KBI as planned and and if KBI installs a
sulfur burner to increase the concentration of the smelter gas with low SO2
concentration (which is currently flared) as planned under the proposed State
industrial financing project. Even with the above schemes, the acid supply
to Samsun would reach only about 300,000 tpy, which falls short of the Samsun
requirements by about 240,000 tpy. Therefore, it is proposed to install a new
economic-sized, sulfur-based acid plant under Phase II. This plant can be
easily modified in the future to use local pyrites instead of sulfur when the
local supply of pyrites increases and the quality is improved. Until the new
sulfuric acid plant is built, the Samsun complex will import phosphoric acid
to make up the shortfall in local production. Facilities for unloading and
piping phosphoric acid from the plant jetty to the phosphoric acid units are
included under the Project.

3.14      The financial position of AZOT improved significantly last year.
AZOT had been showing losses during 1977-79, partly due to low capacity
utilization and partly due to low ex-factory prices fixed by the Government.
However, in 1980, the Government increased ex-factory prices close to interna-
tional levels (para. 4.23), and, as a result, the Company showed substantial
profits (TL 1,952 million). Both Kutahya and Samsun units showed profits in
1980 after losing continuously during 1977-79. The equity base of the Company,
which was eroded because of accumulated losses until 1979, improved appreci-
ably in 1980 due to significant profit from operations in 1980 and about
TL 5.1 billion increase in share capital of the Company with funds from the
Government (the shareholder). As a result, during 1979 and 1980, the debt/
equity ratio of AZOT improved from 98/2 to 50/50 and the current ratio from
1:1 to 1.7:1, both of which are now satisfactory.
4.   Accounting and Financial Management
3.15      Modern financial management and accounting practices are not ade-
quately used in AZOT at plant and corporate levels. Therefore, AZOT needs
help to develop and establish cost centers, management information systems,
financial planning, capital budgeting, and cost accounting and control. The
proposed management improvement program will also cover these aspects, along
with the training needs. Further, the auditing system of AZOT is not satis-
factory with respect to timing. AZOT's accounts are audited by the High
Control Board of the Prime Minister's Office. The reports are usually
published 9-12 months after the end of the fiscal year. Agreement has been
reached that AZOT will have its accounts prepared promptly and satisfactorily
by training more accountants and using external accounting firms if necessary
so that the High Auditing Board could finalize the audit within four months of
the end of the accounting period.
B.   Istanbul Gubre Sanayii A.S. (IGSAS)
1.   History and Organization
3.16      IGSAS was established in March 1971 under the Commercial Code with
TPAO (Turkish Petroleum Corporation), a SEE and Turkey's leading petroleum
company, and IPRAS, a fully-owned subsidiary of TPAO, holding 60% and 40%
of the share capital, respectively. IGSAS operates a Bank-financed ammonia/
urea plant at Tutunciftlik, utilizing naphtha from the adjacent IPRAS refinery.
The plant was mechanically completed in June 1977. Initially, many technical
commissioning problems were encountered, including an explosion in one of the
two auxiliary boilers caused by leakage of naphtha, rupture of the hydrogen
compressor, and damage of the rotor of the syngas compressor. These problems
were partly due to design shortcomings and partly due to lack of operating
experience by local employees. Subsequently, repairs and modifications were
carried out and the plant was commissioned at the end of 1977. Since then,
the capacity utilization of the plant has increased gradually as the operators
gained experience, reaching 84% in 1980. IGSAS is presently managed more
efficiently than other public sector fertilizer companies in Turkey and shows
the highest capacity utilization in the industry.
3.17      The articles of association of IGSAS specify that the Company will
be managed as a private company, and the Loan Agreement with the Bank (845-TU)
stipulates that any changes in the Company's by-laws and statutes need prior
Bank approval. The relatively good performance of the Company can be
attributed substantially to its legal status which allows its management



- 13 -
flexibility in effectively managing the Company. Although the Government has
clearly indicated that it favors continuation of the present IGSAS status, ttie
increasing dependence of the Company's shareholders (TPAO and IPRAS) on
government funding could result in steadily growing pressure to treat IGSAS
as a SEE. This could have long-term negative implications on its performance.
Therefore, the existing covenant that any change in the status of the Company
will not be made without prior Bank approval was reconfirmed during negotiations.
3.18      The IGSAS Board consists of five members.  Besides, two auditors
selected by the shareholders (TPAO and IPRAS) attend Board meetings. In
recent years, board members have been appointed directly by the Ministry of
Energy to which IGSAS reports. Executive management of the Company is vested
in the General Manager who is the chief executive of the Company for the
day-to-day operations. He attends Board meetings but is not a member of the
Board. The General Manager of IGSAS was changed two times during the last
three years because of political changes, though both appointees have been
experienced and competent. However, such changes also lead to turnover at
lower levels of management and the resulting instability has adverse effects
on company performance. In order to assist in maintaining basic conditions
conducive to effective management, satisfactory understandings have been
reached with the Government and the Company that qualifications and experience
of individuals appointed for key positions would be consistent with the job
requirements. Similar understandings were also reached with respect to AZOT
and GUBRE.
2.   Plant Facilities
3.19      The plant is located at Tutunciftlik, some 15 km from Izmit, and
has a 1,000 tpd ammonia unit and a 1,550 tpd urea unit with related utilities
and offsite facilities. The plant was engineered and built by Uhde (FRG).
Naphtha and fuel oil are obtained for the complex from the adjacent IPRAS
refinery through pipeline. Power requirements are met from an 8 MW in-plant
turbo-generator supplemented by the national grid. Fresh water require-
ments are obtained from facilities developed for the IPRAS refinery. Sea
water is used for cooling. The plant has 80,000 tons bulk urea storage,
equivalent to 50-day production capacity.
3.20      After resolving the initial teething problems, IGSAS has stabilized
production, but the economics of the Project has been adversely affected
by the sharp increases in naphtha price. Under the proposed Project, IGSAS
will use platformer gas and refinery off-gas from the IPRAS refinery as
feedstock and fuel respectively to decrease naphtha consumption by 40% and
the fuel oil used for steam generation by 22%. To further improve the
economics of the plant, energy saving measures and modernizations will be
carried out under the Project (para 5.04).
3.   Production Performance
3.21      Capacity utilization by IGSAS has shown an improving trend, with
total urea production reaching 420,000 tons, 84% of design capacity, in
1980. Design capacity and the trend of capacity utilization are summarized
below:

a/   Capacity utilization
The capacity utilization in 1978 and 1979 was affected by shortages of naphtha.
This problem was overcome in late 1979 with increased supply of naphtha by the
IPRAS refinery, and the current capacity utilization is the maximum achievable
at present considering the technical constraints the plant is facing. The
main technical constraints are the lack of steam due to higher-than-design
consumption of steam per ton of product, frequent downtime for cleaning the
naphtha exchangers, corrosion problems in ammonia condensers, syngas compressor
failures, excessive hydrogen content in the carbon dioxide stream from the
ammonia plant, and longer than normal maintenance downtime due to inadequate
maintenance facilities. The proposed Project aims at correcting these
deficiencies.

Because of delays in stabilizing production which are not unusual for plants
of this type, IGSAS was not able to operate profitably during 1977-78. As a
result, the Company showed losses of TL 128 million and 161 million in 1977
and 1978, respectively. However, in 1979, the Company showed a modest profit.
The following year, IGSAS profitability improved substantially partly because
of increased capacity utilization and partly due to the fixing of ex-factory
prices to levels close to international prices. As a result, the Company's
financial situation reached a satisfactory level with the current ratio



- 15 -
increasing to 1.3:1 and the debt/equity ratio reaching 45/55 because of higher
retained earnings. Considering its satisfactory cash flow position and its
ability to operate at high capacity, the Company is expected to be able to
finance the local cost of the proposed energy saving and modernization sub-
project from internal cash generation (para 7.13). Further, the financial
situation of the Company is expected to improve significantly under the
Project which is expected to raise IGSAS capacity utilization to 95% by
helping to utilize the excess design capacity in the urea plant (which would
be capable of reaching 110% after the Project). 1/
3.23      Satisfac-ory accounting and financial management practices are
followed in IGSAS. Auditing is done by two auditors appointed by the share-
holders. In addition, the High Auditing Board reviews the Company's
operations and financial results and reports to the Prime Minister's Office.
C. Gubre Fabrikalari T.A.S. (GUBRE)
1.   History and Organization
3.24      Gubre Fabrikalari T.A.S. (GUBRE) is a joint-sector company estab-
lished in 1953. Currently, three state-owned organizations--T.C. Ziraat
Bankasi (Agricultural Bank), AZOT and T.C. Zirai Donatim Kurumu (DONATIM) own
34% of the shares; agricultural cooperatives and insurance companies own 35%;
and private enterprises and general public own the remaining 31%. The Company
has two complexes, one at Yarimca, in northern Turkey, for the production of
TSP and NPK fertilizers, and the other in Iskenderun, in southern Turkey, for
the production of TSP.
3.25      The direction and management of GUBRE is exercised by a Board of
Directors. The Board has seven members and three auditors. Executive
management of the Company is vested in the General Manager who is the chief
executive for the day-to-day operations. He attends Board meetings but is
not a member of the Board.   Top management staff are headquartered in Istanbul
and are able and experienced. Headquarters staff are organized under two
deputy general managers, one technical and the other administrative. The
operations, planning and investment departments report to the Technical Deputy
Manager; and the accounting/finance, commerce, marine transport, personnel and
office services departments report to the Administrative Deputy General
Manager. The plant managers at Yarimca and Iskenderun are capable and they
report through deputy general managers to the management.
2.   Production Performance
3.26      Design capacities and the recent trend of production of the Company
are summarized below:

3.27      In 1980, the capacity utilization at Yarimca was 62% for the TSP
plant and 65% for the NPK plant. At Iskenderun, capacity utilization was 66%
for the TSP plant. Though these facilities are operating better than many
other fertilizer plants in Turkey, there is room for substantial improvement
through rationalization of the existing facilities included under the proposed
Project. As a result of this rationalization, the capacity utilization is
expected to go up gradually to 90%, which is close to the levels achieved in
1976.
3.28      The Yarimca Complex, 20 km from Izmit, was originally built as a
SSP plant in 1961 and was expanded by the addition of a 75,000 tpy phosphoric
acid plant (based on Rhone Poulenc process of France) in the early 1970s, to
help switch-over from the production of SSP to TSP, a higher-analysis fertil-
izer. The TSP plant was based on the following processes: Broadfield Den for
reaction and Profabril for granulation. The engineering contractor for the
conversion was Woodall Duckam (U.K.), which has been subsequently acquired by
Davy International. The TSP plant operated at relatively high capacity until
1977. Since then, capacity utilization has been low mainly due to difficulties
with the TSP mixer and granulators, which will be replaced under the Project.
The Yarimca facilities were expanded in 1977-78 by the addition of MAP and NPK
units.
3.29      The Complex depends on imported rock phosphate, sulfuric acid and
potassium chloride, local ammonia and urea (from the IGSAS plant 4 km away).
The importation of sulfuric acid is uneconomic because of high transportation
costs. Therefore, a new 710 tpd sulfuric acid plant will be established under
the Project. The high pressure steam from the sulfuric acid plant will be
used to produce power by installing a 4.5 MVA turbine-driven power generator.
This power supply will meet about 50% of the power needs of the Yarimca
complex. This will help the facilities to reduce the downtime to a minimum due
to power failures and cut offs from the national power grid. Any temporary
surplus of sulfuric acid from the new unit would be shipped to Iskenderun
where the sulfuric acid production is not adequate to meet its needs. The
Company owns a 3,000-ton sulfuric acid ship to transport acid.
3.30      Certain parts of the phosphoric acid plant have deteriorated,
affecting capacity utilization. Those parts will be replaced under the
proposed Project. Further, the disposal of by-product gypsum is a serious
problem in Yarimca. Currently, two barges (each of 500-DWT capacity) carry



- 17 -
the gypsum for disposal at sea. Under the proposed Project, a new 500
DWT barge will be procured, an additional pier will be installed and the
gypsum loading system will be remodelled to facilitate faster disposal of
gypsum.
3.31      The Yarimca facility has a municipal water supply pipeline with a
capacity to supply up to 230m3/hr. The plant requirement ranges from 60-
70 m3/hr. However, water shortages occur especially during summer months
when the demand for municipal water in the city increases. This bottleneck
will be overcome with the completion of a new water pipeline completed recently
for supplying additional water to the city.
3.   Operating Results and Financial Position

3.33      Gubre Fabrikalari has been showing profits every year during the
last four years partly due to its higher capacity utilization than most
other fertilizer companies. Net profit has increased sharply during 1979-80
partly due to higher ex-factory prices fixed by the Government. The Company
has a sound debt/equity ratio (33/67) and a current ratio of 1.1:1 which,
under the present high inflationary situation in Turkey, is satisfactory but
would be low in normal conditions. The Company is expected to be able to
finance from internal cash generation the local cost of the rehabilitation
sub-project for Yarimca (para 7.13).
IV. FERTILIZER MARKET, MARKETING AND PRICES
A.   Agricultural Situation
4.01      About 60% of the population of Turkey is dependent on agriculture
for its livelihood. The agricultural sector accounts for 23% of Gross Domestic



- 18 -
Product (GDP) at factor cost. The country is largely self-sufficient in
its food and fiber requirements, 1/ and agricultural commodities--particularly
fruits and nuts, cotton, tobacco and wheat--are its major exports (which
accounted for 62% of total merchandise exports in 1980).  The ability to
maintain a strong agricultural production base to support its population of
over 45 million, which is increasing at an annual rate of 2.5%, is crucial to
Turkey's development.
4.02      Since the beginning of the First Five-Year Plan in 1963, the per-
formance of agriculture has been satisfactory by international standards, with
an average annual growth rate of nearly 3% during 1963-1980, just ahead of
the population growth rate. Output increases up to 1963 have been mainly
due to expansion in the area under cultivation. Since then, because of
the limited scope for increasing further the cultivated area, the emphasis
has changed from extensive to intensive cultivation. Various government
programs have been developed to encourage intensive cultivation, including
expansion of irrigation works, mechanization, feeder road network, extension
services, farm credit, marketing infrastructure, farm price support program,
and more intensive use of agricultural inputs like fertilizers.
4.03      Of the total land area of 77.8 million hectares (ha), only 25
million ha--a little less than one-third--are cultivated, and of that some
16.5 million ha are sown with the rest being left fallow. Considerable
efforts have been made in the last 15 years in developing major irrigation
projects. Currently, 2.8 million ha of land have access to irrigation although
only 2.3 million ha are actually irrigated. By 1995, the area under irriga-
tion is expected to be increased significantly. Although the use of irriga-
tion water is not very efficient at present (because those who have access to
it often use it excessively), its supply and the availability of other modern
agricultural inputs such as tractors, pesticides, high-yielding seed varieties,
and fertilizer, have created a trend towards intensive agriculture in Turkey.
4.04      Foodgrains predominate in land use, accounting for nearly 14 million
ha or over 85% of the sown area. Intensively cultivated crops like fruits and
nuts, vegetables, cotton, sugar beets, sunflowers, and tobacco occupy much
less land than foodgrains but surpass the foodgrains both in terms of value of
production and in terms of consumption of modern agricultural inputs, including
fertilizer. About 40% of fertilizer consumption is now accounted for by
foodgrains while the remaining 60% is accounted for by industrial and other
cash crops.
B.   Past Growth of Fertilizer Consumption, Production and Imports

4.06      From a low base, N consumption increased at an average annual rate
of 26% during 1965-72. During the same period, phosphate and potash (K20)
consumption grew at average annual rates of 18.5% and 24%, respectively.
The annual growth, however, began tapering off after 1972. Consumption
actually declined in 1974 and was virtually stagnant in 1975 because of an
increase in fertilizer retail prices with effect from January 1, 1974. Faced
with this situation, the Government reduced the prices at the end of 1975
which were held steady until 1979 (para. 4.22)--and this resulted in sharp
increases in consumption during 1976, 1977 and 1978, except for that of
K20 which has remained small and has been showing an erratic trend. 1/ In
1979, nitrogenous fertilizer consumption stagnated mainly because of supply
constraints. The following year, N consumption declined by 22% because of
250-400% increases in retail prices in February 1980 and an additional 10-40%
increase in September 1980. It is expected that consumption will resume its
upward trend in 1981 and onwards as farmers realize that in spite of recent
increases in retail fertilizer prices (i.e., the urea retail price has gone up
from US$60/ton in 1979 to US$160/ton in 1980, which is about 53% of the c.i.f.
landed price as shown in para 4.23), the ratio of fertilizer/crop prices are
still favorable for increased fertilizer application. This is also based on
the assumption that the fertilizer supply situation will improve in the future
with increased foreign exchange allocation for the import of fertilizer raw
materials and finished products and the proposed debottlenecking of existing
fertilizer plants.
1/   Agronomic studies of the Government show that the soil in Turkey does
not at present need much potash except for cash crops such as tobacco.

Source:  FAO, Annual Fertilizer Review, 1978.
The latest FAO statistics available show that in 1977 fertilizer consumption
per ha of arable land in Turkey was hardly 26% for N and 36% for P205 of
the European average. Comparable consumption levels in 1977 in the neighboring
countries such as Greece, Italy, Yugoslavia and Romania were 2-3 times higher
for N and about twice as much for P205.
4.08      Fertilizer production has been lagging behind consumption and
considerable imports have been necessary (Annex 4-1). Imported fertilizers
since 1972 have comprised nearly 65% of the N supply, 40% of P205, and 100%
of the K20 supply. Fertilizer imports cost Turkey US$317 million in 1979
and an estimated US$500 million in 1980. As noted previously, in addition
to the imported finished fertilizers, Turkey also relies on imported fertilizer
raw materials and intermediates such as phosphate rock, phosphoric acid and
sulfuric acid (which cost the country an additional US$230 million in 1980)
and most of the local production of ammonia is derived from imported hydro-
carbons. It is more economical for Turkey to import the raw materials and
produce most fertilizer domestically than to import the fertilizer itself, as
shown by the satisfactory economic rate of return of the fertilizer projects.
This is partly due to the existence of sunk costs on fertilizer plants, and
the use of by-products (from refineries and copper smelters). The recent
discovery of natural gasfields, the plans for natural gas exploration, and the
development of the local low-grade phosphate rock and lignite and pyrite
deposits in the country, point to the potential for Turkey to become less
dependent on imports in the future (paras 2.14 and 2.15). In the short term,
Yiowever, the fertilizer industry can derive greater benefits from the more
intensive use of the existing capacity, from the substitution of locally
available lower cost feedstocks like refinery gas for higher-value naphtha,
and from increased production of intermediates such as sulfuric acid initially
based on imported sulfur but ultimately using domestic pyrites. It is,
therefore, crucial for the fertilizer industry to receive adequate foreign
exchange required for these imports from the Government.

C.   Fertilizer Demand Projections

a/   Established in 1976 by the State Planning Organization to prepare a
background report for the development of the fertilizer industry during
the Fourth Five-Year Plan (1978-1982).
b/   As given in AZOT's feasibility study for the Mazidagi Fertilizer Project
prepared in 1977.
4.10      The demand forecasts prepared by AZOT in 1977 for the period 1981-87,
based on a linear projection of past trends in the growth of fertilizer
consumption from a low base, seem very optimistic. The forecasts of the
Special Commission, prepared the same year, have also proved optimistic for
the 1977-82 period. The consumption increased at an annual rate of 8% during
1977-79, reaching 779,000 tons of N in 1979 and declined by 22% in 1980
because of sharp increases in fertilizer retail prices to farmers. The
Ministry of Agriculture has projected that the consumption would reach about
814,000 tons of N in 1981. This represents an increase of nearly 35% over the
consumption in 1980 but an increase of only 4.5% over the consumption in 1979.
Even though the crop:fertilizer price ratio is still favorable for fertilizer
use, it is unlikely that there would be a major jump in fertilizer consumption
in 1981, considering the various constraints (e.g., foreign exchange avail-
ability). The Bank projection assumes that consumption would increase at an
annual rate of 15% during 1981 and 1982 from the low base of 1980; for the
1982-87 period, the growth rate is likely to average 9% considering the
country's medium-term agricultural development plans.
4.11      There is scope for increasing the sown area by reducing the fallow
area (7-8 million ha) and for increasing the area under irrigation. It is
estimated that hardly 20% of the irrigation potential has been realized so
far. Further, as noted, the application of fertilizers on cereal crops is
much below the recommended levels, even though the application rates on
industrial crops are comparatively high. Therefore, there is scope for



- 22 -
sharply increasing the application rates on cereal crops which currently
account for about 70% of the area under cultivation but only for 40% of total
fertilizer consumption.
4.12      Agronomic studies also show that the most favorable N: P: K ratio
for Turkey is approximately 4:3:0.08, which, in fact, is not very different
from the actual ratio already attained. Applying this ratio to the Bank
forecasts for N fertilizer needs, the following demand projections for P205
and K20 are derived:

D. Capacity and Production Forecasts
4.13      The total annual capacity of N and P205 in the country was 364,300
tons and 575,000 tons, respectively, at the end of 1977. Since then, six
new projects were either commissioned or undergoing start-up tests. With
these projects in operation, the annual capacity has increased to 928,300
tons for N and 850,000 tons for P205.
4.14      The production forecasts (Annex 2) are based on the assumptions that
after the completion of the proposed Project, the rehabilitated plants will
gradually reach capacity utilization rates of 85% in Kutahya II, 90% in Samsun
and Yarimca plants, and 95% in IGSAS. 1/ The forecasts are also based on the
assumption that the Government will make all the required foreign exchange
available to the fertilizer industry so that there would be no constraint for
the import of raw materials. Further, it is assumed that the plants of Akdeniz
Gubre and Ege Gubre, and the Iskenderun plant of Gubre Fabrikalari would be
debottlenecked under Phase II during 1982-86, and thereafter gradually increase
their capacity utilization to 90%. The private sector plants are expected to
increase their capacity utilization to 60%, 70% and 90% during 1981-83 if
adequate imported materials and spares are made available to them, since these
plants are not facing significant mechanical problems.
4.15      On the basis of the above assumptions, the gross total production
of N and P205 is expected to reach 884,000 tons and 720,000 tons, respectively,
by 1987. However, discounting the domestically-supplied urea which would
be used by the local NPK plants, the net production of N would be 809,000
nutrient tons in 1987 compared to 191,000 tons in 1977.
1/   Considering that the IGSAS plant is slightly overdesigned, it should
reach 95% of design capacity after the Project.

1985                 753       1,040      287          686         782        96
1986                 786       1,135      349          712         853       141

The above table shows that in spite of the increasing local production,
the demand will exceed production continuously , with the deficit averaging
about 35% and 23% for N and P205, respectively, in 1987.
F.   Input and Output Pricing
4.17      As noted previously, at present fertilizer production in Turkey is
based on naphtha and fuel oil, imported raw materials such as phosphate
rock and pyrites, and imported intermediate products such as ammonia and
sulphuric acid. Companies are allowed to import their raw materials and
intermediate products for fertilizer manufacture after getting the necessary
import licenses from the Ministry of Commerce on recommendations of the
Ministries of Industry and Agriculture.
4.18      As for domestic inputs (e.g., naphtha, fuel oil) for fertilizer
production, they are supplied by the local refineries which are in the public
sector. Refinery product prices are controlled by the Government with a view
to keeping the prices of products used by the low income group (e.g., kerosene
for lighting) at lower levels compared to the prices of products used by the
higher-income group (e.g., motor oil, lubricants, etc.) and those used as
industrial inputs. Petroleum product prices are now regularly being adjusted
to rising crude oil prices and changes in the value of the Turkish Lira (TL).
Naphtha and fuel oil used by the fertilizer industry are priced close to
international prices.
4.19      As for fertilizer product pricing, Turkey follows a system under
which ex-factory prices for fertilizer producers and the retail price for
consumers are established separately and controlled by the Government. Under
the current fertilizer pricing system established in January 1980, ex-factory
prices for each fertilizer plant are determined every six months based on the



- 24 -
average c.i.f. dollar price of comparable products imported by DONATIM, the
main fertilizer marketing agency, during the previous six months. From the
c.i.f. import prices of fertilizer products, the c.i.f. dollar value of direct
raw material imports per ton of fertilizer produced is deducted and the
balance dollar amount (domestic value added equivalent) is valued at a shadow
exchange rate (US$1 = TL 130) 1/. The FOB dollar value of direct raw material
imports are valued at the current exchange rate (US$1 = TL 78.6) applicable
for imports of all fertilizers and fertilizer raw materials, freight and
insurance are valued at normal exchange rate (US$1 = TL 91). This formula aims
at providing an incentive for local fertilizer producers to increase domestic
value added in fertilizer production by investing the necessary facilities to
use local raw materials and manufacture intermediate products for fertilizer
production locally, thereby reducing dependence on imports.
4.20      The main shortcomings in this formula are: (i) the ex-factory prices
may fluctuate widely as international input and output prices fluctuate over a
wide range; and (ii) the shadow exchange rate used to value domestic value
added is determined arbitrarily and is subject to change causing uncertainty
to investors and producers. The first shortcoming could be overcome by using
a moving average of international fertilizer prices (landed cost at Istanbul)
and the second could be overcome by establishing a fixed relationship between
the official exchange rate and the shadow rate to value domestic value added.
The Government is considering changes along these lines.
4.21      The ex-factory prices currently received by the fertilizer producers
are in line with c.i.f. landed prices (para 7.02). For example, for calcium
ammonium nitrate (CAN, 26% N), the nitrogenous fertilizer most widely used
in Turkey (Annex 4-2), the c.i.f. landed price is US$210/ton, and the local
ex-factory price is US$246/ ton (17% higher) at the exchange rate of TL 91
per U.S. dollar. This differential is partly due to the fact that the inter-
national fertilizer prices are still below the long-term equilibrium prices
even though they have increased significantly since the sharp decline in
1976/77 due to cyclical reasons. The differential is expected to narrow as
the international price rises to the long-term equilibrium level.
4.22      Fertilizer retail prices are set by the Government taking into
account the cost/benefit ratio to the farmer, including the relative prices of
fertilizers and crops. However, the overriding concern in recent years has
been to keep prices of agricultural inputs, including fertilizers, at a low
level to encourage increased farm production. As a consequence, fertilizer
retail prices remained low from the mid-1960s to the early 1970s, but
increased steeply in 1974 following the quadrupling of the international
fertilizer prices. However, as noted, fertilizer retail prices were again
reduced sharply in 1975, mainly to reverse the slump in consumption, and were
held at this level until 1979. In 1980, however, to reduce the burden of
fertilizer subsidy on the budget, the Government increased retail prices
twice. The following table and graph compare the trend of the ex-factory
and retail prices of selected fertilizers in Turkey since 1972 for CAN and
urea, another important N fertilizer used:
1/   Turkey currently has a dual exchange rate which is adjusted periodically.
At the end of 1980, the official rate of US$1=TL 91 applied to most of
the transactions. For agricultural exports and imports, the exchange
rate applied was US$1 = TL 78.6.

4.23      The following table compares the prices and subsidy on imported
and local CAN and urea:

Despite the increases in retail prices in 1980, the subsidy element is still
high. For example, in 1980, the farmers' fertilizer subsidy on imported CAN
and urea were about 66% and 53% respectively, while on local CAN and urea,
they were slightly higher at 70% and 56% respectively.
4.24      A study made by the Bank in January 1979 based on 1978 data showed
the following relationships between the farmer fertilizer price and the actual
cost of delivered fertilizer:

The above table shows among the four countries shown, the subsidy amount was
the highest in Turkey. In spite of the significant increases in retail prices
in Turkey in 1980, the subsidy element has remained at about the same level
(as shown in table in para 4.23).
4.25      The total amount of compensation payment on account of fertilizers
is estimated at over US$500 million in 1980. The Government intends to
gradually reduce the subsidies for agricultural products and inputs, including
fertilizers, but recognizes that such phasing of subsidies would have to be
gradual over the next five years in order to avoid an adverse impact on agri-
cultural output or fertilizer use. Along with the elimination of fertilizer
subsidies, the Government, over the long term, intends to allow producers to
set ex-factory prices on the basis of market forces. The Government's strategy
regarding fertilizer pricing and farmers- fertilizer subsidies will be analyzed
under the fertilizer marketing and pricing study (para 4.36).

G.   Fertilizer Marketing and Distribution
1.   Distribution System
4.26      To ensure orderly distribution in as wide an area as possible and
also to prevent black marketing during the periods caused from time-to-time by
inadequate foreign exchange to meet the full demand, fertilizer distribution
is done through two public sector companies--DONATIM and Turkiye Seker
Fabrikalari A.S. (Turkish Sugar Company, SEKER). DONATIM is by far the
largest fertilizer distributor accounting for about 90% of the fertilizer--
both local and imported--distributed in the country. SEKER accounts for the
rest (10%) of the fertilizer distribution and is also responsible for the
production and marketing in Turkey of sugar (mostly based on sugar beets) and
its by-products. SEKER is operating efficiently and beet farmers generally
apply 100% of the recommended fertilizer dosage. DONATIM and SEKER are also
the only authorized fertilizer importers.
4.27      DONATIM is a State Economic Enterprise (SEE) under the Ministry
of Agriculture. It is autonomous in its basic function of supplying the
main agricultural inputs to farmers, including fertilizers, pesticides and
high-yielding seeds as well as animal feed and farm equipment. It also manu-
factures farm equipment (e.g., tractors) and warehouse structures (e.g., steel
frames). It has a staff of 5,000 and operates through its headquarters in
Ankara and 22 regional offices and 300 branches. The branches, in turn, work
through about 3,100 dealers, mostly cooperatives. The main departments of
DONATIM are: (i) commercial (purchasing and distribution); (ii) agricultural
affairs; (iii) agricultural equipment; (iv) manufacturing; and (v) accounting.
The agricultural affairs department has separate divisions dealing with the
distribution of fertilizers, pesticides, seeds and animal feeds. The fertili-
zer division is responsible for determining the country's requirements,
examining sources of supply including imports, ensuring stock control, storage
and distribution and in helping the Government determine ex-factory and retail
fertilizer prices. DONATIM is not involved in sales promotion and extension
services. These services are provided by the Ministry of Agriculture's exten-
sion services which are fairly widespread in Turkey.
4.28      Fertilizer sales have accounted for 30-50% of DONATIM's sales in
recent years, and this activity absorbs a major portion of its manpower. The
volume of fertilizers distributed by DONATIM has increased from about 535,000
product tpy in 1972 to 2.5 million tpy of product. Complete financial data
are not available for DONATIM. On fertilizer sales, it loses heavily. These
losses, to be compensated by the Government, occur because the fertilizer
retail prices (fixed by the Government) are much lower than DONATIM's purchase
price of local and imported fertilizers plus transportation and distribution
costs. Since government compensation payments to cover the difference in the
past were not made in time, DONATIM has itself been slow in making payments to
fertilizer producers, creating a working capital problem for the producers who
have to rely on short-term borrowings with interest rates around 50% to meet
their cash requirements.
4.29      For companies importing raw materials and spares under the Bank's
Structural Adjustment Loan, the Government has been making local currency
funds available from the Budget against receivables of those companies from
DONATIM to buy the necessary foreign exchange. Further, the Government has



- 28 -
been consolidating the receivables and payables of fertilizer and petroleum
companies and DONATIM from time to time. Under the present system, funds
are to be made available to DONATIM and SEKER from the Price Stabilization
Fund (PSF) to cover the difference between the fertilizer price it buys from
the producers and the price at which it sells to farmers through DONATIM and
SEKER. Money for PSF comes from part of agricultural export earnings, i.e. from
a levy on the export earnings from key agricultural commodities. (The levy is
based upon the margin between the international and local support prices for
those commodities.) In addition, the inventory gains of traders and producers
due to changes in official prices are to be credited to PSF. Though
theoretically all inventory profit is to go to PSF, the actual collection is
only a part of the total. Further, PSF is used to make compensation payments
for a number of products. Therefore, PSF does not always have the resources
it needs for its payment to DONATIM.
4.30      The Government has recently taken measures to settle the receivabes
of fertilizer companies from DONATIM and SEKER outstanding for more than four
months. Further, agreement was reached with the Government that it will
review the operation of the PSF under the proposed Fertilizer Marketing
and Pricing Study, and adopt administrative procedures that will ensure
release of compensation payments to distributors within a reasonable period of
presentation of sales invoices so that the distributors will be able to pay
the producers within at least four months of sales.  Over the medium-term, as
fertilizer subsidies are eliminated (para. 4.25), DONATIM would be able to
have the required funds to pay producers, since it will not have to rely on
payments from the PSF.
4.31      So far, DONATIM has been doing a fairly good job in the physical
distribution of fertilizers through its network of outlets developed for the
distribution of not only fertilizers but also other agricultural inputs.
However, as it handles increasing amounts of fertilizers and other products,
it will need to continually appraise its efficiency and effectiveness in
serving its suppliers and customers, the Turkish farmers. Particularly, it
will need to review its dealer network with a view to appointing more private
dealers and establishing adequate retail outlets at convenient locations.
This will, in turn, require that its warehousing capacity be adequately
expanded, warehouses be strategically located and stocked with the right
products, and these products be lifted from the producers continuously
and be made available to farmers in a timely manner without straining the
truck industry-s capacity to cope with the demand for services in the peak
season. Inability of DONATIM to lift the fertilizer produced by local plants
at times causes production stoppages, as there is limited storage space at the
plants. DONATIM should also consider ways of making greater use of rail and
sea transportation. Also, in a virtual monopoly situation where there is
no competition, costs could get out of hand, and the need for government
compensation payments increases, thus straining government resources. There-
fore, DONATIM needs to pay increaseA attention to effective financial
management and explore methods to reduce transportation and warehousing costs
and improve handling efficiency. In this context, as subsidies are eliminated
aAi retail prices reach international levels, the Government could consider
introducing competition in fertilizer distribution by allowing fertilizer
producers to distribute part or all of their products as the gap between
demand and supply narrows with increasing local production. These matters
require the carrying out of a comprehensive review of the sector which will be
done under the proposed Fertilizer Marketing and Pricing Study (para 4.36).



- 29 -
2.   Warehousing
4.32      DONATIM has covered storage for over 1.5 million tons of fertilizer
accounting for about 46% of its current sales. DONATIM is currently implement-
ing a plan to increase its warehousing capacity by building new warehouses
and/or hiring storage space from private companies in order to raise the total
capacity to 4 million tons of bagged fertilizers. (It does not normally
handle bulk fertilizers.) The warehouses are located at main ports of entry
for imported fertilizers, near fertilizer marketing plants, and at the branch
offices. These warehouses are basic modules of 1,500-ton capacity each.
Each warehouse has at least two such modules. The construction of additional
warehouse capacity is concentrated in potential areas of increased fertilizer
consumption. The present warehousing capacity is adequate. The future needs
as well as the progress made in implementing the warehousing expansion plan
will be reviewed by the Fertilizer Marketing and Pricing Study.
3.   Credit
4.33      The main source of both general agricultural credit and credit for
fertilizer is T.C. Ziraat Bankasi (TCZB), the Agricultural Bank of Turkey.
Fertilizer credit has generally been 15% and 20% of all agricultural credit
extended by TCZB. Since 1970, agricultural credit has been growing rapidly at
over 30% per year. Part of the growth is due to the refinancing of uncollected
previous credits. The collection rate for agricultural credit has improved
from 45% in 1970 to about 70% at present but is still low.
4.34      TCZB finances the fertilizer requirements as determined by the agrono-
mists it maintains in most of its branch offices. TCZB has 900 branch offices
of which 800 make agricultural and fertilizer loans (the other 100 providing
banking and commercial services) and has been in existence for 135 years.
Credits are usually rolled over when circumstances beyond the control of the
farmer make it impossible for him to repay the loan. Legal action is taken
only when the farmer has the financial ability to repay but does not do so.
4.35      The availability of credit for fertilizers does not at present appear
to be a significant constraint to fertilizer consumption in Turkey. Besides
TCZB, other institutions--such as SEKER--also provide credit for fertilizer
and other agricultural inputs.
4.   Need for Marketing and Pricing Study
4.36      Though the present fertilizer marketing and distribution system
through DONATIM and SEKER has shortcomings, the Government believes that there
is need to continue it as long as the country-s domestic supply of fertilizers
falls short of demand. Further, the present distributors have a network of
dealers and warehousing facilities in various parts of the country developed
for not only fertilizers but also other agricultural inputs they distribute.
Considering the various issues in the fertilizer pricing, distribution and
marketing system, an agreement was reached with the Government that a ferti-
lizer marketing and pricing study will be carried out. The short list of firms
and the terms of reference (Annex 4-3) have been agreed with the Bank and the



- 30 -
firm will be selected according to Bank guidelines for the selection of
consultants by October 31, 1981. Following the study, the Government will
prepare and furnish to the Bank by June 30, 1983 a detailed plan for carrying
out the recommendation of the study and implement the plan by June 30, 1984 in
consultation with the Bank. Such a study would require the services of five
specialists--an agronomist, one transportation specialist, a marketing expert,
a pricing specialist, a macro-economist and a credit expert. This study is
included as a part of the Project (para 5.11).
V. THE PROJECT
A.   Project Objectives and Scope
5.01      The Project aims at improving the performances of selected fertilizer
plants in Turkey through rehabilitation and modernization. It consists of
four components: (i) rehabilitation of existing plants to remove capacity-
limiting bottlenecks and improving economies of the plants by energy and
feedstock-saving measures (Rehabilitation and Energy Saving Component); (ii)
provision of training facilities to ensure availability of skilled staff to
operate and maintain plant facilities (Training Component); (iii) reorganiza-
tion at corporate and plant levels to establish efficient and modern manage-
ment systems to ensure effective direction and control of the operations
(Management Improvement Component); and (iv) a fertilizer marketing and
pricing study.
5.02      The Project is the first phase of the rationalization plan which
eventually will cover the whole fertilizer industry in Turkey. The Project
covers three companies, AZOT, IGSAS and GUBRE, and four plants: the Kutahya
II and Samsun complexes of AZOT; the Tutunciftlik plant of IGSAS and the
Yarimca plant of Gubre Fabrikalari.
B.   Project Description
1.   Rehabilitation and Energy Saving Component
5.03      Kutahya II:  The  rehabilitation requirements of Kutahya II were
identified jointly by Krupp Koppers, Linde, Babcock--all original suppliers
of the major sections of the plant--and AZOT. The work to be carried out
as part of the proposed Project (Reference B4: Project File) covers: (i)
installation of equipment to facilitate processing of lignite, including
lignite dryers, gas cleaning, lignite mixing and storage facilities; (ii)
modifications and extensive repairs to rehabilitate badly eroded/corroded
equipment and machinery including waste heat boilers, gas compressors, and
steam boilers; (iii) major repairs and improvements of inadequate plant
sections particularly the air separation unit; (iv) improvements to the
utility systems including power supply; and (v) improvements to process and
operation control systems.
5.04      IGSAS Plant:  IGSAS requirements were reviewed by the plant manage-
ment with Uhde (FRG), original designer and constructor of the plant, to
confirm technical and economical viabilities of the proposed modifications
and additions. The work to be carried out as part of the proposed Project
(Reference B5: Project File) covers: (i) modifications of ammonia condensers
and converters, and installation of a purge gas recovery unit to improve
ammonia production and energy efficiency; (ii) modifications in the ammonia



- 31 -
plant to replace part of the naphtha feedstock and fuel with platformer gas
and refinery off-gases, respectively; (iii) rehabilitation of the urea
desorption system and the C02 purification system; (iv) modifications in the
refrigeration system to eliminate excessive corrosion and clogging problems
related to sea water cooling; (v) improvement in the utilities system and the
installation of a new N2 generation unit; and (vi) improvements in bagging,
product storage, handling and shipping systems.
5.05      Samsun Plant:  The requirements of Samsun complex were reviewed by
plant management with Davy International (FRG), successor of the original
designer/constructor, Chemiebau (FRG), for the phosphoric acid, TSP and DAP
units; and Heurtey (France), in collaboration with Lurgi, licensor of the
sulfuric acid plant, for the sulfuric acid plant to identify the measures
necessary to rehabilitate the complex. The work to be carried out as part of
the proposed Project (Reference B6: Project File) covers: (i) revamping the
existing sulfuric acid plant through modifications in the drying tower, S02
blower and economizer; installation of a pyrite crushing and grinding
facility; and addition of a sulfur injection system (to give the plant
flexibility to operate on sulfur if adequate pyrites of the required quality
are not available); (ii) modification to the phosphoric acid concentration
units and building of two new phosphoric acid tanks with pipeline connections
to the existing jetty so that the plant could use imported phosphoric acid to
supplement its own production; (iii) improvements in the existing TSP and DAP
plants including a new handling and storage system and a new bagging unit (for
DAP); and (iv) construction of a new 25 km pipeline to overcome water
shortages (para 3.10).
5.06      Yarimca Plant:  The requirements of the Yarimca complex were identi-
fied with the cooperation of Heurtey and Gubre Fabrikalari. The work to be
carried out as part of the proposed Project (Reference B6: Project File)
covers: (i) adding a new sulfur-based sulfuric acid plant to avoid uneconom-
ical importation of the same and to decrease the plant dependency from external
sources of energy by using high-pressure steam from the sulfuric acid plant
for power generation; (ii) rehabilitation of the existing phosphoric acid
reaction and filtration sections with new rock grinding and pumping facilities;
(iii) modifications in the phosphoric acid concentration section including
replacement of heat exchangers and a new phosphoric acid storage to disaturate
acid before concentration; (iv) rehabilitation of the TSP plant including the
installation of a new TSP mixer and a new TSP granulation and drying section;
(vi) additional facilities for disposing by-product gypsum (e.g., purchasing a
new barge, building a new pier and remodelling the existing loading facilities).

The Project will help increase annual fertilizer production by about 623,350
tons. It will also help substantially increase production of intermediate
products for fertilizer production, and will release annually 88,000 tons of
naphtha and 56,000 tons fuel oil for outside use by substituting for them 80
million Nm3 of platformer gas and 46 million Nm3 of refinery off-gas,
respectively. Further, because of the decrease in specific material
consumption per ton of product after rehabilitation, there will be significant
savings especially in the consumption of sulfuric acid, rock phosphate and
ammonia. Besides, the power problems at Samsun and Yarimca will be alleviated
due to the Project.
2.  Training Component
5.08     The United Nations Development Program (UNDP) is financing a training
center at Kutahya near the AZOT fertilizer complex there.  In addition, AZOT
is developing training facilities at Ankara and Samsun, and IGSAS at Tutunciftlik
for short-term training of professionals. These training facilities need
strengthening to meet the growing needs of AZOT, IGSAS and GUBRE as well as
other fertilizer companies.  Provision has been made in the Project for US$2
million for this purpose mainly for: (i) development of a training program;
(ii) training of trainers; (iii) additional equipment and training aids
required for the training facilities; and (iv) expansion of physical facilities.
In addition, the component will also include expatriate assistance in the
preparation and implementation of the training program. The Training Component
would help vitalize and modernize the training efforts and facilities of AZOT
and IGSAS with the long-range aim of serving all the fertilizer plants in Turkey.



- 33 -
5.09      Further, one of the causes for the low capacity utilization in the
existing fertilizer plants is inadequate preventive and operational maintenance
programs and inadequate trained manpower. To overcome this problem particularly
in the AZOT plants included under the Project, expatriates will be hired to
fill key positions when local specialists are not available. Those specialists
will organize on-the-job training of local people in areas such as preventive
and operational maintenance, etc. Selected local personnel will be sent
abroad for specialization.
3.   Management Improvement Component
5.10      As noted, management and organizational problems are particularly
serious at AZOT. Therefore, a comprehensive study of the management and
organization of AZOT, the leading fertilizer company, will be carried out
under the Project by a a competent firm (para 3.05). Subsequently, the firm
will help AZOT prepare and implement a plant operations and financial manage-
ment improvement program with particular reference to: (i) organizational
changes to increase efficiency of operation; (ii) delegation of authority and
responsibility to plant level management; (iii) better inventory control and
maintenance; (iv) better energy management; (v) better transportation manage-
ment; (v) improvement in wage policy to minimize turnover of professionals;
(iv) introduction of modern financial management techniques (e.g., establish-
ment of cost centers, management information system, standard costing,
financial planning and capital budgeting, etc.)
4.   Fertilizer Marketing and Pricing Study
5.11      The Fertilizer Marketing and Pricing Study (para 4.36) will examine
and recommend the necessary measures to improve the efficiency of the fertil-
izer transportation, storage and distribution system, and analyze the
fertilizer pricing system. A Steering Committee with representatives from
State Planning Organization (SPO), the Ministry of Agriculture, the fertilizer
industry, DONATIM, SEKER and Agricultural Bank will be appointed to supervise
the study. This group will meet at least quarterly. Further, a Project Unit
will be established within SPO to help supervise and coordinate the study and
implement its recommendations. Agreement to this effect has been reached
with the Government.
C.   Project Management
5.12      Implementation of the Project for each plant will be the responsi-
bility of the individual companies owning these plants. Companies have formed
project teams for each plant to be rehabilitated/modified and these teams are
staffed with experienced senior engineers. The teams in IGSAS and GUBRE are
adequate to supervise and expedite the implementation work to be done with the
help of established foreign engineering firms. In the case of AZOT, services
of consultants will be required for project management as AZOT has a limited
in-house expertise in this field and also for improving plant operations. The
consultants will strengthen the Project Teams for rehabilitation sub-projects
of AZOT using to the extent possible, talent and experience available within
the company organization and supplementing local personnel with expatriate
experts as necessary. These experts will work as part of the Project Teams
and will also train company personnel during project implementation and
provide technical assistance for improving the existing plant operations. The
basic objective of such arrangement is to create project management expertise



- 34 -
in AZOT to serve their plans for future investment projects and to improve the
existing operations. It has been agreed that AZOT will hire as a condition of
disbursement of the loan portion for AZOT at least four experts--one for
operation, one for maintenance, one for training and one for project implemen-
tation. (Similar arrangements are not required for IGSAS and GUBRE as these
companies do not require technical assistance for operations and imple-
mentation.)   Other experts needed to strengthen the operating and project
implementation teams of AZOT will be appointed on the recommendations of these
four experts who will help AZOT to prepare a staffing plan by March 31, 1982.
AZOT will implement the staffing plan by June 30, 1982 in consultation with
the Bank. A Coordination Unit has been established by AZOT at its headquarters
in Ankara for coordinating the work under the proposed Project. Procurement
of equipment and materials will be handled by the Project Teams with the help
of the main contractors and the existing procurement organizations of the
companies concerned.
D.   Project Schedule
5.13      Considering the urgency of implementing the rehabilitation Project
as quickly as possible and because of process considerations, the companies
concerned intend to start negotiations with the firms who originally designed
and constructed the plants and sign contracts with them. The project schedules
for the plants are determined by two factors: (i) the speed with which the
companies can finalize the engineering arrangements for each individual plant;
and (ii) the need to carry out the modifications with minimum production
interruptions and, therefore, mostly during scheduled annual maintenance.
From the date of engineering contracts, Kutahya II would take 25 months for
completion; Samsun and Tutunciftlik, 29 months; and Yarimca, 36 months. For
Kutahya II and Tutunciftlik, the contracts are expected to be signed in May,
1981; and for Samsun and Yarimca in January 1982. Project implementation
schedules are given in Annex 5.
E.   Ecology
5.14      Presently, the plants included in the Project are meeting local
environmental standards. The plant facilities to be rehabilitated/modified
will adopt international standards for pollution control. In addition,
measures will be taken to ensure better safety and health standards. The
proposed Project does not include investments to improve the overall ecology
of the facilities not included in the Project. Satisfactory agreements have
been reached with the companies that project facilities will meet satisfactory
environmental standards.
F.   Raw Materials
5.15      One of the constraints for increasing capacity utilization is the
unreliable supply of local inputs such as lignite, pyrites, rock phosphate
etc., with respect to quantity and quality. The companies producing those
materials have not been taking adequate measures to improve the quality
of those materials to meet the needs of the fertilizer producers. To alleviate
this situation, the concerned fertilizer producers, their local raw material
suppliers and the Government agencies have reviewed their mutual problems
and the Government has asked the suppliers to take steps to improve the
quality and increase the quantity of materials supplied to fertilizer produ-
cers. Satisfactory agreement has been reached that the Government will
establish a Coordination Committee with representatives from the fertilizer



- 35 -
producers, fertilizer raw material suppliers, the SPO and appropriate
ministries which will periodically review fertilizer raw material supply
problems and evolve solutions.
5.16      After rehabilitation, the requirements of imported raw materials,
especially of the Samsun and Yarimca plants, will go up. Satisfactory
assurances have been obtained from the Government that adequate foreign
exchange will be made available to Samsun and Yarimca plants to meet their
full requirements of imported raw materials following rehabilitation.
G.   Employment and Productivity
5.17      Since the Project is basically a rehabilitation/modification of
the existing plants, the additional employment created will be limited to
100-150, consisting of additional personnel who will be hired for the new
sulfuric acid plant at Yarimca and for additional unloading, handling, and
shipping operations following rehabilitation of the plants included under
the Project. After rehabilitation, the labor productivity in those plants
is expected to increase substantially, partly as a result of the Training
Component of the Project to vitalize and modernize the training efforts
and facilities of AZOT and IGSAS with the long-range aim of serving the
entire fertilizer sector in the future.
VI. CAPITAL COST, FINANCING PLAN AND PROCUREMENT
A.   Capital Cost
6.01      The total financing required for the Fertilizer Industry Rationaliza-
tion and Energy Saving Project is estimated at US$236.6 million, including
US$131 million equivalent in foreign exchange. The capital cost estimates are
detailed in Annex 6-1 and summarized below:

companies  and engineering firms  estimates.  Physical contingencies are
calculated at 10% of the base cost estimate. Price escalation for foreign
costs are based on the forecast of international inflation rates in dollar
terms for 1981, 9%; 8.5% for 1982; and 7.5% for 1983 and onwards. The same
international rates have been used for local equipment and materials, civil
works and erection assuming that the difference in the domestic and inter-
national rates will be accounted for by adjustments in the foreign exchange
rate. Incremental working capital requirements are estimated at US$4.6
million equivalent, excluding the cost of spare parts for two years included
under the Project.

6.04      About 97% of the total financing required (except interest during
construction and working capital) is estimated to be needed for the reha-
bilitation component, and the remaining 3% for the training, management
and marketing improvement components. The Project includes US$20.4 million
for about 1,500 man-months of service by specialists. The average cost of
these services including subsistence expenses is estimated at about US$13,000/
man-month.

a/   Allocation of the Bank loan by companies is shown in para 6.13.



- 38 -
6.06      The Project would be financed with 47% debt and the remaining 53% by
equity. The proposed Bank loan of US$110 million will cover 84% of the total
foreign exchange requirements. The rest of the requirements (to meet mainly
the working capital requirements and part of the interest during construction)
amounting to US$21 million will be covered from foreign exchange sources of
the Government. Of the Bank loan, US$10 million would be for financing
interest during construction on the loan portion to AZOT whose cash flow
is unsteady.
6.07      The Bank loan would be extended to the Turkish Government for 17
years, including 4 years of grace at the prevailing rate of interest. The
Turkish Government would onlend the amount to AZOT, IGSAS and GUBRE with the
companies bearing the foreign exchange risk. The terms for onlending will be
12 years, including 4 years of grace, at an annual interest rate 10% above the
present standard Bank lending rate of 9.6%. Signing of satisfactory subsidiary
loan agreements between the Borrower and the Companies concerned will be a
condition of Bank loan effectiveness.
6.08      No problem is foreseen for IGSAS and Gubre Fabrikalari in meeting
their local currency expenditures from internal cash generation as the plants
of these companies are operating at a higher capacity than many other plants
in Turkey and as their cash flow situation is expected to remain sound
in the future as well. Under the present pricing formula, AZOT's Kutahya
II and Samsun plants and also AZOT as a whole showed profit in 1980 after
showing losses continuously for three years. Considering the significant
variation in capacity utilization in AZOT plants and the level of internal
cash generation, it is assumed that only about US$39 million equivalent
(about 26% of the total) would be financed from internal cash generation and
an additional US$40.0 million equivalent will be provided or caused to be
provided by the Government (the shareholder) either as share capital or
loans from the State Investment Bank and/or commercial banks within the
overall 60/40 debt/equity ratio for the company (after revaluation of assets)
and the debt service coverage of 1.5 times. Of this amount, the Government
has agreed to provide or cause to be provided to AZOT US$25 million equivalent
in 1982 and US$15 million equivalent in 1983 when the investment requirements
of AZOT are high. Besides the general cost overrun guarantee from the Govern-
ment, an agreement was also reached with the Companies that if the internally
generated funds are inadequate for the equity financing of their sub-projects
and/or if the Project should experience a cost increase, the Companies will
borrow and/or increase share capital within the overall 60/40 debt/equity
ratio and the 1.5 times debt service coverage. For purposes of this under-
taking, the Project will be considered complete when Kutahya II, Samsun and
Yarimca facilities operate at 80% capacity and the Tutunciftlik plant operates
at 90% capacity over three consecutive months.
C. Procurement
6.09      All equipment and materials to be financed by the Bank loan will
be procured from prequalified suppliers in accordance with Bank procurement
guidelines. International competitive bidding (ICB) will be used for equipment
and materials, except for US$27.5 million of proprietary and critical items
and small items costing US$100,000 or less to be procured under limited
international tendering (except for proprietory items which would be procured
on a negotiated basis). Local suppliers, for purposes of bid evaluation, will
receive a preference of 15% or the amount of the customs duty, whichever is
lower.



- 39 -
6.10     Because of the existing process licensing agreements between the
companies and the engineering firms which originally engineered and built the
plants, the rehabilitation/modification of those plants will be carried out
with the help of the same engineering firms and/or those firms which do not
use or market processes competing with those used in such plants. But those
firms will be asked to hire as sub-contractors specialized firms acceptable to
the companies and the Bank in certain critical areas where the lead firms
require expertise support. The following firms are being considered as lead
firms: (i) Krupp Koppers for Kutahya II; (ii) Uhde for IGSAS; and (iii) Davy
International for Samsun and Yarimca. Bids will be invited from a short list
of qualified firms approved by the Bank for the new sulfuric acid plant at
Yarimca, and for the new purge gas recovery unit at IGSAS and contract awarded
in accordance with criteria agreed with the Bank.
6.11     Civil engineering, civil works, erection contracts and some equipment
which is expected to be procured locally will be financed by the companies
with Turkish Lira funds. All these contracts and/or purchase orders will be
awarded after competitive bidding among local contractors and/or suppliers.
The capabilities of local contractors and suppliers are considered adequate
for timely and efficient completion of this part of the works.
6.12     Considering the urgency of implementing the rehabilitation Project as
quickly as possible, the companies concerned plan to start negotiations with
the proposed lead firms and sign contracts as soon as possible. Also, in the
case of IGSAS, in some areas where engineering work is already completed, pro-
curement activities can be initiated immediately. The Government and companies
have requested that the Bank consider retroactive financing of down payments in
foreign exchange made to engineering firms and equipment suppliers prior to the
signing of the loan. The amount proposed to be retroactively financed under
the loan would be up to US$4 million. Such retroactive financing will help
advance the implementation schedule of the Project.
D.  Allocation and Disbursement of Bank Loan
6.13     The Bank loan will be allocated by the Government as indicated in

6.14      For expenditures eligible for Bank financing, disbursements would
cover 100% of f.o.b. cost of equipment, materials and spares; 1/ 100% of the
cost of services and of the ex-factory cost of equipment supplied by local
firms winning in international competition (excluding local taxes); 100%
of the foreign cost of services for training and management improvement
programs; and 100% of foreign expenditures or up to 60% of total costs of the
Fertilizer Marketing and Pricing Study. Disbursement (Annex 6-2) is expected
to be completed by December 31, 1985. Local firms are expected to win about
US$10 million of equipment and services under international competitive
bidding.
VII. FINANCIAL ANALYSIS AND RISKS
A.   Project Revenue
7.01      The financial analysis of the sub-projects is done in current
terms in US$ and the major assumptions, detailed in Annexes 7-1, 7-2 and 7-3,
are summarized below.
7.02      As noted, the ex-factory fertilizer prices are set by the Government
every six months in consultation with the local producers and the main ferti-
lizer marketing agency, DONATIM, and are based on the import prices paid by
DONATIM during the previous six months. The following table shows the prices
fixed by the Government for the second half of 1980 for products of AZOT,
IGSAS and GUBRE:

Turkey are 8%-17% higher than the c.i.f. landed price for comparable products.
As the international prices are still below the long-term equilibrium level,
they are expected to increase in real terms up to 1985. As the international
prices increase in real terms, the gap between the local ex-factory prices
and the c.i.f. landed prices is expected to narrow. For revenue projections,
it is assumed that the ex-factory prices will remain constant at 1980 levels
up to June 30, 1984, when the Government is expected to revise its pricing
policy following the proposed Fertilizer Marketing and Pricing Study. For the
period beyond June 30, 1984 the financial accounting prices are assumed to be
the same as the economic accounting prices used in project analysis. Agreement
has been reached with the Government that prices for locally-produced
1/   According to Turkish regulations, equipment and materials have to be
transported in Turkish ships. Therefore, freight cost will not be
eligible for Bank financing.

fertilizers will at least be at levels comparable to the c.i.f. landed prices
of similar imports as long as the Government sets exfactory prices for
fertilizers.
B.   Production and Production Costs
7.03      The capacity utilization in the plants included under the Project
was as follows in 1980: Kutahya II, 22%; Samsun, 45%; Tutunciftlik, 82%;
and Yarimca, 65%. The capacity utilization in Kutahya II could increase
from 22% to 28% and in Samsun from 45% to 55% even before the rehabilitation
project is completed if the external raw material supply situation improves
as Kutahya II gets uniform quality lignite through proper mixing at the mine
or the plant site, and as Samsun gets more sulfuric acid from local and/or
foreign sources. Further increases in capacity utilization could come only
from major rehabilitation work. As a matter of fact, it would be uneconomic
to operate Kutahya II beyond 1984 without revamping. In the case of
Tutunciftlik and Yarimca plants, they are currently operating at their maximum
attainable capacity and need debottlenecking to increase capacity utilization
beyond 80% in the former and 65% in the latter. Besides, in Yarimca as well
as in Samsun, it is likely that their capacity utilization would decline by
1988/89 without rehabilitation even if they face no constraints with respect
to external supply of raw materials.
7.04      While evaluating the impact of the rehabilitation project on the
increase in capacity utilization, the above factors are taken into account
and only the increase in production over and above what could be achieved
by ensuring adequate raw material supply to those plants are attributed
to the Project. On this basis, it is assumed that the capacity utilization
could increase as follows in the four plants: Kutahya II, from 28% to 85%
by 1986; Samsun, from 55% to 90% by 1985; Tutunciftlik, from 80% to 95% by
1985; and Yarimca, from 65% to 90% by 1986. As noted, because of the adequate
provision for revamping, training and operational assistance, the attainment
of the above capacity utilization levels is considered realistic.
7.05      Price of local lignite has increased by 160% in 1980, reaching TL
875 (US$9.6) per ton. Prices of local naphtha and fuel oil are close to
international prices. Imported raw materials for fertilizer production are
valued at the c.i.f. import price using the lower exchange rate (lUS$ = TL
78.6) under the system of the dual exchange rate followed in Turkey. The cost
of imported raw materials is expected to increase during 1980-85 in real
terms and this is taken into account in the projections. Labor cost are based
on past payroll costs of the companies concerned. Utility costs are based on
prevailing unit rates in Turkey. Maintenance costs are estimated at 2.5% of
the equipment and civil works for five years after debottlenecking/modifica-
tions, rising to 3.5% from 1989 and onwards as the project facilities get
older. Depreciation is calculated on a straight line basis on the assumed
10-year life after rehabilitation.
C.   Financial Projections for the Project
7.06      In order to reflect a reasonably accurate picture of the Companies
financial obligations, cash generation and liquidity situation before and
after debottlenecking/modifications, the financial projections are made in
current US$ terms. The output price as well as production costs in current
terms are projected to increase at an average rate of 9% in 1981, 8.5% in
1982, 7.5% in 1983 and onwards.

b/   After Rehabilitation.
c/   It is assumed that Kutahya II would be closed in 1985 if it is not
rehabilitated.
7.08      Total incremental sales from the Project are estimated at US$243
million in 1985, rising to US$310 million in 1987 (the first year of optimum
production). The Project shows a net profit of US$51 million in the first
year after rehabilitation/modifications in 1985 and the net profit rises to
US$68 million in 1987 as the production builds up. The Project is expected
to generate from the first year after rehabilitation/modification enough cash
to more than meet its debt service.
D.   Financial Rate of Return
7.09      The cost and benefit streams for the incremental financial rate
of return are expressed in real 1980 terms as shown in Annex 7-6. The
return is satisfactory at 49% before and 33% after taxes.  Results of the
sensitivity tests are summarized below:

7.10      The above sensitivity tests indicate that even under adverse
circumstances, the Project shows very satisfactory rates of return. The rate
of return is more sensitive to changes in sales revenue than in operating and
capital costs. A one-year delay in project implementation, combined with a
10% capital cost increase and the eventual attainment of 10% less capacity
utilization than assumed would reduce the return to nearly 41%. However, the
likelihood of this happening is low, particularly because of the involvement
of experienced engineering firms and the provision for a comprehensive training
program.

a/   The increase in sales between 1980 and 1981 is mainly due to the expected
increase in production in AZOTs new plant, Gemlik.
b/   The decline in net profit is due to increase  in corporate income tax
from 25% to 50% as of January 1, 1981.



- 44 -
7.12      The projections for the Companies show that during 1981-87, total
sales and net profit of AZOT will increase by 186% and 268% respectively;
of IGSAS, by 73% and 165% respectively; and of GUBRE, by 112% and 105%
respectively. Net profits increase faster than sales in the case of AZOT and
IGSAS because of the increase in the efficiency of operation and spreading of
the fixed costs over a higher volume of production. However, in the case of
GUBRE, which produces phosphatic fertilizers based on imported raw materials,
in spite of the effect of the above factors, the net profit of the company is
expected to increase at a slower rate than the rate of growth of sales due to
the projected increases in the prices of raw materials in real terms during
the next five years from the current depressed levels.
7.13      The projections show that the cash generation for all the three
companies should be adequate to finance local costs of their rehabilitation
under the assumptions mentioned earlier with respect to prices and the
removal of external constraints to capacity utilization. Though IGSAS and
Yarimca have stabilized production at currently attainable levels, AZOT
production performance has been unsteady and the commissioning problems
in its new plant, Gemlik, are yet to be overcome. Therefore, it is assumed
that only 50% of the local cost needs for the rehabilitation of its plants
(Kutahya II and Samsun) would come from internal cash generation and the
rest from borrowings and/or share capital from the Government.   If the cash
generation in AZOT materializes as projected, the Government as the shareholder
is expected to take surplus cash from the Company by way of dividends.
F.   Financial Covenants
7.14      The current ratio of all the three companies is at or above 1.1:1
and their debt/equity ratio is below the 60/40 level. Section 4.07 of the
Loan Agreement for the Tutunciftlik Plant of IGSAS stipulates that at the
completion of the Plant, the current ratio of the Company should reach 2:1.
This is a rather stringent stipulation particularly at times of inflation.
Under the proposed project, this provision has been changed to the effect that
IGSAS will maintain a current ratio of at least 1.3:1 at all times. This
covenant applies to GUBRE, too. However, in the case of AZOT because of its
unsteady performance, the Company will be required to maintain at least a 1:1
current ratio during Project implementation (1981-85) and 1.3:1 from 1986
onwards. Further, the following covenants similar to those in the IGSAS legal
documents will apply to AZOT and Gubre Fabrikalari: (1) maintain a debt/equity
ratio of 60/40; (ii) not incur additional debt if, by so doing, the projected
debt service coverage would fall below 1.5 times; and (iii) without Bank
consent, not declare dividends nor make any other cash distribution if after
such payments the current ratio falls below 1.4:1. Further, it was agreed
that during Project implementation AZOT will not invest annually more than
US$7 million, except for the Gemlik ammonia plant under construction, and
IGSAS and GUBRE will not invest more than US$5 million each on works other
than those included under the Project without prior approval of the Bank. It
has also been agreed with the companies that they will periodically revalue
their assets for memorandum account on the basis of replacement cost and in
accordance with sound accounting principles.
G.   Auditing and Reporting Requirements
7.15      As agreed under the IGSAS loan, AZOT and Gubre Fabrikalari will
also be required to submit to the Bank annual reports audited by independent
auditors acceptable to the Bank within four months of the end of the fiscal



- 45 -
year. The Companies will give prompt attention to audit recommendations. In
addition to the annual audit reports, the Companies will submit quarterly
financial statements within 45 days after the end of each quarter and monthly
project progress and procurement status reports within three weeks of the end
of each month. Finally, within four months after the loan closing for the
Project, the Companies will prepare and furnish to the Bank a completion
report on the Project dealing with its implementation, initial operation, and
the costs and benefits derived and expected to be derived therefrom.
H.   Risks
7.16      Risks associated with project technology, start-up and operations
are moderate as the Project is based on commercially proven technology, and
adequate arrangements have been made under the Project for training personnel
for operation and maintenance. However, commissioning problems after rehabi-
litation and difficulties in attaining and maintaining a high operating rate
cannot be ruled out. Considering the involvement of experienced and established
engineering firms in the design, engineering and commissioning of the Project,
the risk of abnormal problems, shut-downs and low operating rate is not,
however, considered serious.
7.17      The main risk facing the Project is the possibility of delays in
implementation and inadequate cost controls due to management deficiency.
However, this risk will be reduced with the strengthening of the operational
staff and project team of AZOT with expatriate specialists; the involvement of
the engineering firms for project design and implementation; and the under-
standing reached that qualification and experience of individuals appointed
for key management positions will be consistent with the job requirements.
However, the management aspect will require continuous monitoring by the Bank
to avoid problems.
7.18      No commercial risk is foreseen.  Even on the basis of a conservative
market forecast, the country will continue to be deficit in fertilizer even
after the Project is completed. The financing plan assumes that approximately
US$15 million for the IGSAS subproject, US$32.6 million equivalent for the
GUBRE subproject and US$39 million for the AZOT subprojects will come from
internally generated funds; this depends on the Government allowing them
adequate ex-factory fertilizer prices. Measures have already been taken by
the Government in this direction.  Should the internally generated funds fall
short of the requirement, the shareholders will meet the deficit and there
is a back-up agreement with the Government to ensure it.
7.19      The operational foreign exchange requirements for the Project for
procuring raw and other materials will increase after rehabilitation. This
will be more than fully compensated by the foreign exchange saved by reducing
the finished fertilizer imports as a result of increased production from the
Project. The commitment by the Government to provide adequate foreign exchange
for raw and maintenance materials (para 5.16) should give further assurance in
this respect.
VIII. ECONOMIC ANALYSIS
A.   Economic Justification
8.01     Kutahya II, Samsun, Tutunciftlik and Yarimca fertilizer plants
account for approximately 40% of the total fertilizer nutrient capacity in



- 46 -
Turkey. Of these, three--Kutahya II, Samsun and Yarimca--have been operating
at low capacity (22-65%) since 1976, mostly due to technical and management
problems. The proposed Project would help Kutahya II, Samsun and Yarimca to
increase capacity utilization by 15-55%. It will also help prevent the
deterioration in capacity utilization from 1985 onwards through adequate
replacement investment during 1981-84.
8.02      The Tutunciftlik plant, which is a new plant now operating efficiently
(at 84% of urea capacity in 1980), is based on a feedstock (naphtha) whose
price has increased sharply following the 1973 oil crisis and which commands a
premium in the world because of the rapid expansion of the naphtha-based
petrochemical industry. Under the proposed project, various cost and energy
saving modifications and/or additions will be implemented at the plant to
reduce its energy costs and increase production. By using refinery platformer
gas as naphtha feed supplement and refinery offgas as reformer fuel naphtha
supplement, naphtha feedstock consumption per ton of ammonia will be reduced
from 0.735 ton to 0.440 ton, which in absolute terms at full design capacity
corresponds to a total saving of 97,350 tons of naphtha worth US$34 million a
year. Further, fuel oil consumption per ton of ammonia will be reduced from
0.22 ton to 0.17 ton, corresponding to an annual saving of 56,000 tons of fuel
oil. The substitution will help reduce part of the refinery gases that will
otherwise be flared after the IPRAS refinery expansion which is far advanced
and is expected to be completed in 1981.
B.   World Prices of Fertilizers and Inputs
8.03      Past experience shows that world fertilizer prices have strong
cyclical fluctuations. This is mainly because of overinvestment in fertilizer
production facilities when international prices are high and the postponement
and/or cancellation of investments when prices fall. Fertilizer prices peaked
in mid-1974 and prices remained high until mid-1975. Subsequently, they
declined sharply during 1976/77 due to the reduced imports of fertilizer by
countries which had accumulated substantial stocks during the panic buying of
1973-75 in anticipation of further price increases, and the substantial
investments stimulated by high prices in the early 1970s. From the low levels
of 1976/77, fertilizer prices have been rising but have not yet reached the
long-term equilibrium level. According to the projections made by the Bank
Commodities Division, fertilizer prices (f.o.b. exporting countries) are
expected to reach the long-term equilibrium level by 1985--US$270/ton for
urea, US$240/ton for TSP and US$420/ton for DAP in 1980 terms.
8.04      Based on these f.o.b. prices, insurance and local port handling of
US$40/ton (assuming Turkey would be importing fertilizers from Europe and the
Middle East if it does not expand local production), the projected long-term
landed price of bagged fertilizer in Turkey (excluding import duties) is used
as the economic accounting price. Economic accounting prices for imported
inputs are also calculated on the same basis. The locally supplied input is
valued at its f.o.b. value if the input is in surplus with respect to the
country's needs; if the input is in short supply, it is valued at the landed
CIF price. On this basis, local naphtha is valued at f.o.b. price as
Turkey is surplus in this product and fuel oil is valued at c.i.f. price as
the country is short of fuel oil and this situation is expected to continue.
Non-tradeable items are valued at their financial costs excluding taxes and

C.   Economic Rate of Return
8.05.     Annex 8-1 gives the assummptions used and Annex 8-2 the investment,
operating cost and revenue streams used in the economic rate of return calcu-
lations.  The incremental benefits from the Project come from:  (i) the
increase in production volume (over and above what could be realized by making
adequate foreign exchange available for imported raw materials and spares);
(ii) prolongation of the economic life of the plants through necessary replace-
ment investments; and (iii) the decrease in the energy consumption and other
operating costs (realized from switch-over to more economic feedstocks and
fuel, and adoption of energy-efficient production techniques).
8.06      On the basis of input and output prices calculated on the assump-
tions explained in paras 8.03 and 8.04, the sub-projects show economic rates of
return ranging from 68% for Tutunciftlik, 39% for Yarimca, 39% for Kutahya II
and 35% for Samsun. For the Project as a whole, the return would be about 43%.
8.07      The following table shows the results of the sensitivity analysis
on the incremental economic rates of return:

As shown in the above table, the economic rate of return for the Project is
sensitive to changes in fertilizer prices, capital and operating costs, delays
in construction, and capacity utilization. A 10% drop in revenue would
reduce the return of the Project to 35% and a 10% increase in operating costs
would reduce the return to 39%. A one-year delay in implementation combined
with a 10% capital cost increase and the ultimate attainment of capacity
utilization of 10% less than assumed would reduce the returns to 35%. There-
fore, even under conceivable adverse conditions, the Project yields high rate
of return.
8.08      In considering the basic justification for rehabilitating the
existing facilities, it is important to consider, in addition to the incre-
mental returns, the economic viability of the facilities after the rehabili-
tation. Therefore, the economic rates of return for the entire facilities at
the four locations have also been calculated before and after the proposed
Project treating the past investment on those plants as sunk costs but taking
their salvage values into account. Salvage values of the old plants at
Kutahya, Yarimca and Samsun are estimated at US$15 million, US$40 million and



- 48 -
US$40 million respectively at 1980 prices. The salvage value of IGSAS (which
has been in operation for only three years) is assumed at 70% of the original
investment expressed in 1980 prices (i.e., US$180 million). The results of
the economic analysis based on the above assumptions are summarized below:
Economic Eate of Return for Entire Facilities (%)
Before Rehabilitation          After Rehabilitation
Kutahya II                   28                              37

Yarimca                      11                              23
a/   The return would be 12% if the entire investment on the IGSAS plant is
taken into account.
The above table shows that after rehabilitation, all the four complexes
included under the Project will be economically viable and their continued
operation justified.
8.09      The IGSAS plant shows a satisfactory economic rate of return in
spite of its being based on naphtha because of the following factors: (i) its
capital cost in real terms (expressed in 1980 prices) is substantially lower
than what it would cost to build such a plant now as the cost of building
fertilizer plants has gone up in real terms by more than two times since
1973-74 when most of the equipment for it was already purchased; (ii) it
achieved high capacity utilization (about 80%) fairly quickly in three years
and is expected to improve its capacity utilization further in the future;
and (iii) the economic value of its naphtha feedstock is valued at the f.o.b.
export price as naphtha produced locally is in surplus and is expected to
remain so since many of Turkey's petrochemical projects have been postponed
indefinitely; and (iv) with the substitution of platformer and refinery
off-gases for part of the naphtha used by IGSAS, the economic rate of the
project went up significantly.
8.10      In the case of Samsun and Yarimca, further analyses have been
done to find out the economic rates of return under the following assumptions:
(i) establishing no new sulfuric acid plant at Yarimca; (ii) closing the
sulfuric acid plant at Samsun; and (iii) closing phosphoric acid units at
both locations and relying completely on imports to meet their phosphoric
acid needs for the production of phosphatic fertilizers. Based on those
assumptions, the economic rates of return for Samsun and Yarimca would be
15% and 17% respectively. As these rates are lower than the rates with the
new sulfuric acid plant at Yarimca and continued use of the existing acid
producing facilities at Yarimca and Samsun, as shown above, the approach used
under the Project to establish a new sulfuric acid plant at Yarimca, debottle-
neck the existing sulfuric acid plant at Samsun, and rehabilitate the existing
phosphoric acid plants at both locations and keep them operating is econo-
mically more attractive. From the social point of view also, this approach is
a better one as it helps avoid the closing of the sulfuric acid plant at
Samsun and the phosphoric acid plants at Samsun and Yarimca and throwing at
least 500 people out of work.

D.   Foreign Exchange Benefits
8.11      In 1987, when the project reaches the forecast production levels,
the domestic production would increase by 623,000 tons which would save an
estimated gross import cost (c.i.f. Turkish ports) of US$168 million in 1980
prices (Annex 8-3). Net of foreign debt service, the Project would still
generate foreign exchange savings of US$118 million in 1987. The foreign
exchange cost of the Project would be more than covered with the net foreign
exchange savings of one year after Project completion in 1985.
E.   Other Economic Benefits
8.12      Under the Project, fertilizer use and marketing would be improved by
new measures expected to result from the proposed marketing and distribution
study. The overall management and organization of AZOT, the leading public
sector fertilizer corporation, would be improved as a result of the imple-
mentation of a program to that effect, following the proposed management study.
The project implementation capability of AZOT and Gubre Fabrikalari would be
improved as a result of the technical assistance proposed. The productivity
gains which are expected to result from better fertilizer availability would
help increase total agricultural output and improve farmers income.
8.13      Through the Project, the Bank will be working closely with the State
Planning Organization (SPO) to help increase the capacity utilization in the
fertilizer sector as a whole and with DONATIM to improve the fertilizer
marketing system. Further, as a part of the institution-building effort,
training facilities of AZOT at Kutahya and Ankara would be expanded and
strengthened, and a new training program would be started for IGSAS
and Gubre Fabrikalari. The unquantifiable economic benefits of training
as well as technical assistance, and assured supplies of fertilizer add to
the attractiveness of the Project.
IX. AGREEMENTS

(iii) study the alternatives and submit a report by September
30, 1981 on the steps to be taken to solve Kutahya II power
problem along with an implementation schedule and firm
financing arrangements (para 3.08);
(iv)  prepare the annual accounts promptly and satisfactorily by
training more accountants and using external accounting firms,
if necessary, so that the High Auditing Board could
finalize the audit within four months of the end of the account-
ing period (para 3.15); and
(v)  prepare with the help of technical consultants a staffing plan

portion to AZOT will be the appointment of four consultants (para 5.12).
Further, the condition for disbursement of the loan portion to AZOT for
Kutahya II equipment will be the preparation of technical and financial
arrangements satisfactory to the Bank to solve the power problem at Kutahya
(para 3.08).
9.03      Based on the above agreements reached, the Project is considered
suitable for a Bank loan of US$110.0 million equivalent.

ANNEX 3-1
TURKEY: FERTILIZER RATIONALIZATION AND ENERGY SAVING PROJECT
AZOT MANAGEMENT IMPROVEMENT PROGRAM
TERMS OF REFERENCE
Background
1.        Azot Sanayii T.A.S. was formed in 1954 to build and operate a
nitrogenous fertilizer plant at Kutahya, utilizing lignite as its raw
material. The first plant, Kutahya I, was completed and commissioned in
October 1961. A second coal-based fertilizer plant, Kutahya II, was built
at the same site, and started up in September, 1968. A third plant--now
for phosphatic fertilizer--was built at Samsun and started up in November
1971. Azot has also constructed another nitrogenous fertilizer plant at
Gemlik, which was commissioned during 1980. Another large coal-based
fertilizer project at Soma may be taken up in the near future.
2.        Azot was formed in 1954 as a private company according to the
Commercial Code of Turkey. Although the affairs of the Company are
carried out in accordance with its Article of Association and as per the
provisions of the Commercial Code, the Company has assumed with time the
status of a State Economic Enterprise (SEE) since its entire capital has
been provided by State institutions. As a result, the Company has become
subject to the requirements and restrictions of the Laws related to SEEs
in the formation of Board of Directors, appointment of the General Manager,
audit by State High Auditing Board, and employee status as "civil servants."
This dual status has affected restrictively the Company management and
decision-making process, resulting in over-centralization of authority and
thereby adversely affecting the efficiency of the operations.
3.        Possibly, under the influence of the dual status, many essential
process plant operation management functions such as process engineering,
production planning, maintenance planning, inventory management and control,
inspection, internal auditing, cost accounting and control, training have
with time become either non-existent or confused with other functions.
Furthermore, line, staff and service functions at the plant level are not
delineated clearly which is causing confusions in the exercising of authority
and responsibility by the personnel.
4.        These organizational and management inadequacies, over the years,
have resulted in insufficient operation practices, neglected maintenance and
rehabilitation efforts and low production level. The proposed rehabilitation
project, covering AZOT's Kutahya II and Samsun plants, will remedy essentially
the technical inadequacies. To derive the full benefits of the project it
is essential that the organizational and management improvements are also
taken up simultaneously.



- 54                            ANNEX 3-1
Page 2
5.        AZOT intends to obtain expert assistance for the design and
implementation of process plant operation management methods, including
financial control and accounting systems. The scope will also include
corporate-level improvements as necessary.
Objectives
6.        The purpose of the technical and administrative assistance is:
(i) To study the nature and type of powers and responsibilities
of AZOT's Board of Directors, General Manager and the Govern-
ment, and recommend measures to bring about the necessary
changes to make the company management responsible for day-
to-day operations. While the Government will monitor the
performance of the management against selected targets.
(ii) To design an effective corporate level organization and assist
AZOT in implementing the new organization and management
practices.
(iii) To reorganize plant level organization to establish missing
essential elements such as process engineering, project
engineering, inspection, etc. Expatriate experts could be
provided to fill certain positions if required experience
and talent are not readily available within AZOT organiza-
tion, but the ultimate aim should be to train AZOT personnel
for these positions.
(iv) To develop and institute efficient management systems and
practices with special emphasis on management reporting,
financial accounting, internal auditing, cost accounting and
control, personnel management, long and short-term corporate
planning, etc., consistent with local and legal considerations.
(v) To combine the "project implementation group", formed for the
rehabilitation project using to the extent possible talent
and experience available within AZOT organization and supple-
menting with expatriate experts as necessary, into the permanent
organization to manage AZOT's future investment projects.
Scope of Work
Reorganization at Corporate Level
7.        To effectively function as a multiple plant operation company,
reorganization at corporate level is also necessary. However, such reorgan-
ization may have restrictions and the implementation may require legislative
action.
8.        In this context corporate level reorganization work will cover:
- A thorough study and understanding of the legal and institutional
framework (Law 440 covering SEEs; Law 657 covering personnel
management, Law 468 covering accounting and reporting etc.,)



- 55 -                        ANNEX 3-1
Page 3
governing the formation and operation of SEEs. Also a
thorough study of the AZOT's formation and transformation
through the years and present status as well as proposed
changes.
-  After this study is completed a detailed report will be
prepared to establish and assess the present status and
problems and to recommend changes and/or reforms required
for effective functioning, suggesting alternative arrange-
ments for restructuring.
-  Review and discuss this report with AZOT General Management,
and if so required with Ministries of Industry and Finance
as well as State Planning Organization and establish accepted
and practicable principles, requirements and goals to form
the basis of the re-organization work.
-  Based on this principle prepare a detailed re-organization
proposal and clearly delineate and explain all line,
service and staff functions keeping in mind the proposed
plant level reorganization.
-  Present, review and discuss these proposals with AZOT's General
Management and if necessary with other authorities and/or
institutions to establish an acceptable solution.
-  Based upon the accepted organization scheme prepare or help
to be prepared by the personnel job descriptions, job evalu-
ation, procedures and standards clearly indicating line of
authorities and responsibilities.
Reorganization at Plant Level
9.        To ensure effective and efficient plant operations, plant-level
reorganization will be carried out to establish adequately the functions and
their inter-relations as a modern chemical process plant organization, to
provide experts where local talent and expertise is not readily available
and to train AZOT personnel to replace the expatriates in the shortest
possible time.
10.       In this context the reorganization will:
- Study and analyze the existing plant organization for better
understanding of constraints and improvement needs of the present
organization.
- Prepare a report reviewing the present status and problems and
assessing changes required to improve the organization.
- Review this report with involved plant staff and AZOT General
Mlanagement to establish agreed basic principles upon which the
new organization should be built.



- 56 -                         ANNEX 3-1
Page 4
- Based on this principle, prepare a detailed organization sheme,
delineate and explain all line, service and staff functions and
indicate their inter-relations in different alternative solu-
tions.
- Based on this organization scheme, prepare job descriptions, job
evaluations, lines of authority and responsibility for senior
and middle management.
- Guide and direct the preparation of work procedures and/or
standards in the areas of operation, maintenance, engineering.
personnel, accounting etc., to ensure harmonious inter-relation
of all daily activities.
- Develop an efficient management information system to facilitate
the control and decision making process of the management.
- With the participation of accounting experts (see para. 11 below),
develop, design and implement a financial control and accounting
system. Such system should be designed as to properly and timely
reflect the Plant's operations and activities during rehabili-
tation project implementation as well as at the normal operation.
It should be capable of accurately recording the various cost
inputs from all aspects of the Plant's operations and should readily
provide the wide range of data needed to assist management in its
operations and financial decisions.
- In developing the financial control and accounting system, a
careful review of Turkish laws and regulations as well as AZOT's
internal requirements is required to avoid solutions which may
not be compatible with local laws and conditions.
Development of Financial Control and Accounting System
The task of the accounting experts will be as follows:
- Develop and help implement a "Cost Accounting System" with accounts
classification into variable and fixed costs and direct and indirect
costs, detailing cost centers. The cost accounting system should be
able to generate information for assigning responsibility, measure
labor and input productivity against norms, analyze and control
cost variances from the norms, and for determining the level of
profitability at plant level so that fertilizer prices can be fixed
by the goVernment with the full knowledge of costs. The system
should also include payroll accounting and procedures.
- Develop and help implement a "Standard Financial Accounting System"
and genral accounts classifications detailing balance sheets, income
statements, cash flow statements, etc., together with related
policies, systems procedures, principles of accounting recommended,
follow up methods, and definitions.
- Develop and help implement a system of "Financial Planning" including
the introduction of operational objectives and the planned alloca-
tion of resources in the form of Operating Expense Budgets and



- 57 -                           ANNEX 3-1
Page 5
Capital Expenditures Budgets to be incorporated in the
consolidated company budget. The budgeting system should
be co-ordinated with the financial accounts in order to
reconcile budget variances with financial figures.
- Help implement the use of related analytical techniques
for recording, planning, control and evaluation of the
"Operational Activities", including production inventories,
deliveries, store management, transportation, personnel,
etc., and evaluate their financial implications.
-  Help implement "Internal Auditing Systems" through internal
audit procedures and built-in internal checks especially
for the handling and accounting of cash, payroll, purchasing,
inventories, etc.
- Recommend and help install an "Organizational Structure" for
the most efficient conduct of the accounting and finance
functions within the context of the overall organization
structure, determine communications channels, and write job
descriptions for financial and accounting staff.
- Design and help implement the use of "Standard Forms" for
recording and controlling all transactions; implement systems
of "Management Reporting" including documentation procedures
for the development of information in a frequency and amount
as may be needed for decision making and corrective actions at
different management levels.
- Prepare an "Accounting Manual" to be used by the Company to
assist supervision in ensuring the adequate accounting of all
transactions, the timely and accurate presentation of informa-
tion, and the training of staff.

TURKEY:- FERTILIZER RATIONALIZATION AND ENERGY SAVING PROJECT
TERMS OF REFERENCE FOR FERTILIZER MARKETING AND
PRICING STUDY
A. Introduction
1.        The Fertilizer Industry in Turkey is undergoing a period of rapid
growth and development. There are at the present time eight fertilizer
companies in operation in Turkey. Four of these companies are in the
public sector, three are in the joint sector and one is in the private sector.
There are two other companies planning to produce fertilizers in the near
future. The present eight fertilizer companies operate a total of 17 fertilizer
plants and there are five plants under commissioning, plus six additional
plants planned to be in operation by 1987. It is estimated that the production
of N and P205 will increase from 308,000 tons and 346,000 tons respectively
in 1980 and 842,000 tons and 716,000 tons respectively by 1987.
2.        The Government of Turkey wishes to undertake a detailed study of
fertilizer marketing and pricing system now in use in order to evaluate the
need to streamline and expand it to handle future requirements.
B. Oblectives
3.        The objectives of the Marketing and Pricing Study will be:
a)    To  review the fertilizer production centers, their locations,
products and quantities produced, including those which will
come on-stream during the period 1981-1987;
b)    To determine the domestic market for all types of fertilizers up to
1987, based upon appropriate assumptions for fertilizer application
rates and to recommend the optimum system for maximizing consumption
of fertilizers to secure increased crop production;
c)    Depending upon the outcome of the information developed from
(a) and (b), determine which products may be needed for importation
including recommendations for improving the present procurement
system for greater efficiency and effectiveness;
d)    Based upon the estimated supply and demand, determine and
recommend the optimum system for handling, storing and
delivering by sea and land transport, the total quantity of
fertilizer from the producing and/or importing points down to
the village level;
e)    To determine the optimum system for marketing the products
within the existing market areas and expand and extend marketing
to new areas and for establishing a mechanism within DONATIM to
continuously explore and devise new methods and techniques for
ensuring a ready supply of fertilizers to farmers throughout the
country at the right time, at the right place, at the least cost; and



- 67 -
ANNEX 4-3

(i) Fertilizer Production
4.        Making use of already existing information, review the past five
years of domestic fertilizer production, plant locations, products, quantities
produced, production costs, ex-plant price, types and quantities of raw materials
used from what sources and locations and costs and mode of transport to the
plant sites.
5.        Present production plus the production from already announced
plans for new plants has already been projected for a period of ten years;
this information should be utilized as the base case domestic production
input for the study.
(ii) Fertilizer Demand
6.        Making use of already existing information, review the past five
years of fertilizer consumption, by quantities, products, by geographical
area (regions, districts, provinces, counties) by crop use, cultivated land,
planting seasons, the use of recommended and actual fertilizer application
rates, fertilizer prices, farm produce prices, farm size, extent of irrieation
facilities and other cultural practices. (In this context, trie cuiisultants
will coordinate their work with the pricing and land use study being financed
by the Bank under the Turkey Grain Storage Project.)
7.        Taking into consideration the above factors and the projected
fertilizer consumption for 5 years by nutrient and by products, by
geographical areas (regions, districts, provinces, counties) on the basis
of assumed fertilizer application rates, by crop and share of cultivated
land taking into account probable cost/benefit relationships, this information
should be utilized as the domestic consumption input for the study.
8.        An analysis should be prepared specifically on the projected
end-use of various types of fertilizers by geographical sub-divisions.
(iii) Supply-Demand Balance
9.        On the basis of the information secured in (i) and (ii) above,
review the past supply-demand balance (nutrients and products), the quantities
imported, c.i.f. prices of imported products, sources of imported products,
receiving ports and any constraints experienced in securing adequate supply
to meet expected demand.
10.       On the basis of the projected production and demand and the resulting
supply-demand balance for 5 years, make recommendations which will ensure
efficient and effective procurement of adequate quantities to meet the projected
import requirements (products and nutrients) indicating receiving ports, possible
sources and probable c.i.f. prices.

operate on a sound financial basis, that revenues being generated are distributed
effectively and promptly in order to avoid unnecessary borrowings for either
capital investment or operating purposes.
(xvii) Timetable
29.       Considering the present system and any recommendations prepared
for incorporating into the system, prepare a time schedule indicating when
each addition or modification should be made. This should indicate the
beginning time for each item and the time when such should be completed
and in operation. The firm will prepare a mid-term draft report four months
from the start of the study.
(xviii) Investment Plan
30.       Determine the investment cost of all assets to be acquired as
recommended in the marketing and distribution plan, broken down into local
and foreign exchange costs. The annual operating costs including that
of personnel and annual investment plans to augment and/or replace assets
should be established. This calculation should cover a five-year period
in detail and for the next ten years in outline.
31.       This would include a financial analysis to provide the cost
per ton of fertilizer distributed together with income and expense accounts,
cash flow statements, and balance sheets for the organization and system
proposed. Appropriate allowance for the inventory of fertilizer in the
system should be made and for all proposed capital investments.
(xix) Economic
32.       In connection with (v) and (vi) above, review the methods used to
finance fertilizer production and distribution, assess the extent of subsidy
and credit needs of fertilizer sector, review credits provided by public and
private banks for fertilizer use, and examine and recommend appropriate crop/
fertilizer price ratios for Turkey by making a cross-country comparison.

TURKEY: FERTILIZER RATIONALIZATION AND ENERGY SAVING PROJECT
ASSUMPTIONS FOR FINANCIAL ANALYSIS
A. Basis for Projections
The financial rates of return for the Project are calculated in
real 1980 terms, but the cash flow projections are done in current
US$ to reflect the actual financial position of the Companies using
projected international inflation rates of 9% for 1981, 8.5% for 1982
and 7.5% for 1983 and onwards.
The assumptions used for capacity utilization before and after
the Project and the incremental production due to the Project are
detailed in Tables 1 and 2.
B. Production Build-up
The rehabilitation/modification of Kutahya II is expected to be
completed December 1983; Samsun, June 1984; Tutunciftlik, December
1983; and. Yarimca, September 1984. The capacity utilization in those
plants is expected to increase as follows:
Percentage (%)
1983     1984      1985     1986      1987      1988
1.  Kutahya II           45        57        80       85        85        85
2.  Samsun               65        80       85        90        90       90
3.  Tutunciftlik         80        90       95        95        95       95
4.  Yarimca              70        75        85       90        90       90
The capacity utilization in Samsun will start going up before the sub-
project is completed because a phosphoric acid unloading and piping
facility at the plant (a part of the subproject) will be operational by
1983, helping Samsun import phosphoric acid directly (instead of rock
phosphate and sulfuric acid) and increase production of TSP and DAP.
C.  Variable Production Costs
Prices of imported raw materials are adjusted for expected real
increases up to 1985, when their prices are assumed to reach the long-
term equilibrium level.  The projected annual real increases for main
imported materials are given below:
1981     1982      1983     1984      1985
Rock Phosphate                     6.0       6.0      5.5       5.0      4.0
Sulfur                             1.7      4.0       4.7       4.5      4.3
Sulfuric Acid                      1.7      4.0       4.7       4.5      4.3
Phosphoric Acid                    4.0       3.6      3.5       3.7       3.6
For local materials, prices are expected to increase at 2% a year in
real terms up to 1985 and beyond that period it is assumed that there
would be no real increase.

D. Fixed Costs
Maintenance costs are estimated at 2.5% of new investment on plant
equipment and civil works during 1985-1990, rising to 3.5% subsequently.
On the existing facilities, the current maintenance costs are assumed
to continue at the present level in 1980 prices.
Depreciation: The Project life is assumed to be 10 years after
rehabilitation. Straight line depreciation has been used over that
period.
Interest on Long-term Debt: It is assumed that the Bank loan will
be onlent to the Company by the Government at an annual interest rate
of 12%.
Payroll (including fringe benefits): No increase in employment is
expected in Kutahya II, Samsun and Tutunciftlik. For Yarimca there would
be marginal increase in the number of employees because of the new sulfuric
acid plant. No real increase in wages and salaries are expected.
Other Costs: Assumed to be 0.5% of the Project installed cost.
E. Legal Reserves
According to Turkish Law, legal reserves are calculated at 5% of net
profit, until these reserves reach 50% of the paid-up share capital.
F. Taxes
The financial projections take into account: (i) the existing
corporate tax rate of 50% on profits; (ii) the financial equalization
tax of 3% of the income tax after the corporation tax.

ANNEX 8-1
TURKEY: FERTILIZER RATIONALIZATION AND ENERGY SAVING PROJECT
ASSUMPTIONS FOR ECONOMIC ANALYSIS
A.  General
The economic rates of return for the Project are calculated
in real 1980 dollar terms. Project life is assumed at 12 years
with 5% terminal value credited to the Project in addition to the
recovery of working capital. Duties and taxes are excluded from
all cost and benefit streams. The assumptions for increase in
capacity utilization and incremental production due to the Project
are explained in Table 1 of Annex 7-1.
B.  Benefits
Product prices used in the economic analysis are based on the recent
Bank projections. 1/ Currently, the international fertilizer prices are
depressed and they are projected to reach the long-term equilibrium level
in 1985. These long-term equilibrium prices expressed in 1980 terms are used
to calculate Project revenues. The following table shows the economic
accounting prices used for fertilizer products:

C. Operating Costs
Economic input costs are also based on projected long-term
equilibrium prices expected to be reached in 1985 expressed in
1980 dollars. Labor, maintenance and other operating costs are
based on those used for financial analysis. The following table
shows the economic accounting prices used for main inputs;
