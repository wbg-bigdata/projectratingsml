MEMORANDUM TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS AND THE PRESIDENT
SUBJECT:   Project Completion Report on Argentina
Righwav Sec.tor Proiect (Loan 2296-AR)
Attached is a copy of the "Project Completion Report on Argentina -
Highway Sector Project (Loan 2296-AR)", prepared by the Latin America and the
Caribbean Regional Office. The report draws on an earlier draft and includes
Part II, both contributed by the borrower.
The project sought to develop transport sector institutions, promote
road traffic safety and enhance government-Bank dialogue on sector policies.
Main components designated for Bank financing were civil works, road traffic
counters and technical assistance.  The project was conceived as a "sector"
project and at appraisal as a subset of a time slice (four years) from a long-
term sector program.  Total project costs were unspecified and the "sector"
format was seen as less prone to disbursement delays which had afflicted earlier
highway lending.
Civil works (the principal component) suffered substantial
implementation delays, caused by a lack-luster performance of executing agencies
and unfavorable macro-economic conditions. In mid-1993, five and one-half years
after the appraisal-projected completion date and three years after actual loan
closing, various project-financed roads were still under implementation. Loan
disbursement were delayed by two and one-half years.   Most works actually
completed to date had good economic rates of return. Project contribution to
road safety is unclear. Institutional achievements were mixed. Government and
Bank had a sector policy dialogue.
On balance, the project had a satisfactory outcome, and institutional
development was partial. Sustainability is likely because of an improved macro-
economic situation and ongoing Bank lending. PCR quality is acceptable. No
performance audit is currently planned.

HIGHWAY SECTOR PROJECT
PROJECT COMPLETION REPORT
PREFACE
This is the Project Completion Report (PCR) for the Highway Sector
Project in Argentina for which Loan 2296-AR in the amount of US$100 million
was approved on May 31, 1983. The Loan was closed on May 29. 1990. two
years and five months behind schedule, when US$90.36 million was disbursed
and US$9.64 million was cancelled.
The PCR was prepared by the Infrastructure and Energy Operations
Division of the Latin America and Caribbean Country Department IV. The
Borrower sent a brief PCR in October 1992, and it has been contemplated in the
report. On May 27, 1993, the Borrower sent a letter with comments on Parts
I and III of the final draft of this PCR. The letter is included in Part II of this
report.

HIGHWAY SECTOR PROJECT
PROJECT COMPLETION REPORT
EVALUATION SUMMARY
1.    Objictives
1.1   The main objectives of the project were largely achieved. The project
comprsed civil works in the national and provincial road system, and a
technical assistance program for strengthening the government entities
responsible for transprt (para 3.01). By linking significant investments in the
national and provincial programs to important institutional changes for the
improvement of the policy planning and operational capabilities of the National
Directorate for Transport Planning and Programming (DNPT), the project laid
the foundations for the implementation of a comprehensive strategy for the
tansport sector.  The DNPT was subsequently converted into the Sub-
Secretariat of Transport Planning (SSTP). The large number of small but
imporant studies conducted under the Technical Assistance Program helped
begin the definition of a long term plan for the reorganizaticn of the highway
sub-sector and to clarify the strategy for restructuring the railway system (para
5.06).
2.   Implementation and Results
2.1   There were substantial delays in the implementation of the Civil Works.
These were caused initially by the slow progress in the evaluation and start up
of the various subprojects and later by problems in obtaining counterpart funds,
mainly for the provincial works, some of which remained uncompleted (para
5.02). As a result of the delays, the loan closing date had to be extended twice
and the loan was closed 2 1/2 years later han the date foreseen at appraisal.
2.2   The overall cost of the project was 16.5%  higher than appraisal
estimates, the increase being largely on account of the inflation in dollars (para
5.08). The economic re-evaluadon of the individual national road sub-projects
(para. 6.04) shows ERRs greater than 12% (except in one case, which shows
an ERR of 10%), ranging from 14% to over 50%. In the expost evaluation of
provincial roads (para. 6.04) sixty five percent of the evaluated sub-projects
have ERRs greater than 12%, ranging from 12% to 43%. In the rest, the
provincial roads show ERRs in the order of 8-10%, with one exception that has
an ERR of only 3%. The broad geographic distribution of the subprojects
ensured that the benefits of the road improvements were dispersed and widely
distributed despite the delays in the execution of the works. The fact that the
loan had a Sector format (parm 4.01 and 5.02) and consequently was not tied to
predetewmined projects, minimized the adverse effects of the restrictions in the
road investment budget, caused by the economic difficulties in the country.
3.    Sustainability
3.1   Much of the Project as originally conceived was sustaimble as the civil
wors iunproved the deterioratng sections of the road network in Argentina.

HIGHWAY SECTOR PROJECT
PROJECT COMPLETION REPORT
Several of the institutional goals were achieved. and the project provided the
start of a long term program followed up in subsequent highway/transport sector
projects.
4.    Fmdings and lessons learned
4.1   This was the first transportation project in the Bank with a sector format.
It established the advantages of the sector concept in as much as it allowed a
greater range of justifiable projects to be financed (para 5.02). The preparation
and execution of this project set a pattern for future sector projects in the
Transport Sector, notably the Fifth Railway Project for Mexico in 1984, and the
Road Maintenance and Rehabilitation Sector Project for Argentina in 1993.
4.2   Although project implementation was delayed (para 2) the objectives of
the project were largely achieved (para 1), and the economic re-evaluation
shows a satisfactory rate of return on the investments (para 3). However, the
rather extended appraisal process appears to indicate, albeit with the benefit of
hindsight, that the project was appraised prematurely (para 2.03). Secondly,
project results highlight the importance of the macroseting and show how
changes in Government, and inappropriate fiscal and budgetary policies can not
only delay the preparation of a project (para 2.03) but also its implementation
(para 5.01 and 5.02). Thirdly, the poor perfonnance in the provincial
component showed up the importance of strengthening the capability of the
provinces. The weaknesses in the program for the transfer of technology and
responsibility to the provinces, revealed during the implementation of the project
(para 5.03) focussed attention on the problems of the provinces (para 6.02).
The requirement of passing a provincial law in each province to authorize the
commitment of funds was a major cause of delay (pam 5.02). Finally, it also
became evident that the duplication of responsibilities among national and
pro'!incial agencies for similar highway activities resulted in inefficiencies in the
subsector. These issues were recognized in the Bank's Transport Sector Work
(October 1988) and later embodied in the Argentine Governments's decree
616/92 (April 1992). This decree eventually resulted in the reorganization of
the roles of the National Highway Directorate (DNV) and the Provincial
Highway Directorates (DPVs). A program of assistance for the implementation
of this change has been included in the Road Maintenance and Rehabilitation
Sector Project of 1993.

2.    Background
2.1   Argentina has a diverse and extensive transport network to integrate its
2.7 million kmn2 of territory, and to serve the needs of its population of 33
million. The network covers 38,000 kan of national roads and 180,000 kan of
provincial roads, 34,115 km of railways, 17,000 km of pipelines, 46 ports and
terminals and 65 commercial airports.  Following the worldwide trend,
highways represent increasingly the dominant mode of internal transport, (69%
of interurban freight, 83% of interurban passe1,gers, 100% of urban freight, and
88% of urban passengers). The railways share is a modest 10-12 % of each of
the three businesses (interurban freight and passengers, and urban passengers)
in which it participates. Pluvial and coastal shipping carry 21% of interurban
freight and air tansport handles about 7% of interurban passengers. As far as
international traffic is concerned, ships and airlines catry m.ost of the foreign
trade and passenger traffic respectively.
2.2   Argentina's economic and political difficulties over the past few decades
significantly affected the transport sector, and in the mid seventies traffic
declined on much of the highway network. After 1976 traffic regained its
previous level, resuming regular growth at 4-6% per year until 1981-1982 when
the economic tecession again affected it. Transport budgets, by and large, have
also tended to fluctuate with the economy. However despite the ups and downs
caused by the economy, the basic national road network is in place, although not
quite to the stdards required, and sorely in need of maintenance to keep it
going.

HIGHWAY SECTOR PROJECT
PROJECT COMPLETION REPORT
2.3   Prior to the pmparation of this project the Bank had been extensively
involved in the transport sector through four highway projects, two railway
projects and a port project.  These projects played an important role in
supporting sectoral planning and strategic investments. n reinforcing the
ransportation network in generai, and the highway netwo.   particular. The
preparation of this project started in September 1980 durin4 the supervision of
the Fourth Highway Project, and the First Project Brief was issued on October
28, 1980. This was followed by a Bank mission in January V)81 to specially
look into the safety aspects of Road Traffic in Buenos Aires, La Pampa, Rio
Negro, Neuquen and Bahia Blanca. A Project Brief update, issued on January
20, 1981, highlighted the main issues as being the imiposition of appropriate
Road User Charges, the development of program plamning in the DNV (the
National Highway Directorate, the role of the DNPT, (the National Directorate
for Transport Planig and Programmg) and the need for decenralization of
responsibility to the Provinces. In addition, there was an undercurrent of
concern reprding the impending changes in the government, expected in March
1981. Appraisal of the Project took place between Febnruy 21, 1981 and
March 6, 1981 and was followed by a rather large Bank mission in April 1981,
to review the progress of the various studies initiated under the auspices of the
National Transport Plan financed by an earlier Highway Project. This was
folowed by a Pbst-Appraisal mission in May 1981. Although invitation to the
Borrower to negotiate was sent in August 1981, d mission in November decided
to reconsider whether the timing for the project was appropriate. Fiscal deficit
and high inflation in Argentina, resulting in lack of budgetary funds, made it
difficult to assure financing for the project. Negotiations were first postponed
to March 1982, then to May 1982 and finally, with another few missions in
between, to April 1983. Board approval was given on May 31, 1983 to a loan
of $100 million for financing a Highway Sector Project to be based on the 1983-
1986 investment program. Considering the long time taken between appraisal
and Board Approval (over two years) it would seem that the project was
appraised prematurely.
3.    Project Objectives and Description
3.1   Project Objectives. At the time this project was appraised there was as
yet no single agency that controlled all transport undertakings viz; the highways,
railways, airways, ports, pipelines etc., and responsibility was so diffused
between the ministries of Economy and Public Works and Services that it was
impossible to establish balanced investment and operational, pricing and
regulatory policies for the transport sector. Studies conducted under the
National Transport Plan (NTP) enabled the formulation of a comprehensive
straegy for the transport sector and for ivestment and policy planng. The
proessive imp      ion of this strategy became the primary focus of this
project, which likd investments in the DNV's and the provinces' programs,
to Technical Assistavce aimed at strengthening the operational investnent and
policy planing capabilities of the sector. Specifically this was planned to be

HIGHWAY SECTOR PROJECT
PROJECT COMPLETION REPORT
(a)   The establishment, clarification and strengthening of the role of
the DNPT, witi: a sector wise perspective.
(b)   The efhctive pursuit and implementation of the recommendations
of the NTP on Sector-wide issues, such as road user charges,
passenger transport regulation, role of the railways etc;
(c)   The reorganization and strengthering of DNV's Planing
Department and improvement of its operational procedures for
updating the investment program;
(d)   The progressive decentralization of the DNV's activities through
the transfer of some of its responsibilities to the provinces;
(e)   The definition of appropriate road maintenance systems and
budgetary requirements for their implementation; and
(f The improvement of DNV's traffic safet, program.
3.2   To a considerable extent therefore, the success or failure of this project
should be measred against the implementation of the above-mentioned
objectives.
3.3 Project Description. The Project was formulated to assist the Borrower
in the financing of parts of DNV's Four-Year Investment Program, for the years
1983 dtough 1986, road investments in the Provinces during the same period,
and technical assistance to DNV and DNPT. The main components of the
Project were:
(a)         Execution of a approved civil works sub-projects in the
national road system which had a high priority for the
economic and social development of the Country (para
3.04);
(b)   Execution of approved civil works sub-projects in the provincial
road system of a high priority for the economic and social
development of the Partcipant Provinc  and the Borrower (para
3.04);
(c)         A technical assistance program to improve the planning,
progammina   and  operation  of DNVs  activities,
including, 1irS.0Iia, road and bridge design, traffic
engineering, spcial types of ma        operations,
mainteance costing and dministA'on, traffic satt, and
investment p        :;and

IIIGHWAY SECTOR PROJECT
PROJECT COMPLETION REPORT
(d)   A technical assistance program to strengthen DNV and DNPT's
capabilities for a broad range of issues related to the execution of
the NTP and the definition of transport sector policies.
The civil works program was broad-based and comprised a variety of
subprojects ranging from road marking, installation of road signs and betternent
projects, to reconstruction of existing road sections and constuction of urban
beltways and access roads. The national program. covered a total of 1,564 kms.
of roads in 150 different sections (table 4) and the provincial program 668 kms.
in 27 sections (table 5). Procurement of traffic counters was included to help
DNV upgrade a comprehensive traffic count system, set up in 1971 with
technical assistance from the U.S. Federal Highway Administration. Technical
Assistance to DNV and the DNPT was intended for employment of high level
experts for studies to be carried out as part of the program for the
implementation of the recommendations of the NTP. The Project was expected
to be completed by December 31, 1987.
4.    Project Design and Organization
4.1 Taking ituo account the Bank's long association with Argentina in
general, and with DNV in particular, a sector loan format was considered
appropriate for the project. In such program any sub-project within the time
slice chosen (1983 to 1986) could be a potential candidate for financing, as long
as the economical evaluation brought out clearly the justification for the sub-
project. Whereas this placed the onus for preparing the justification on the
borrower (by now considered mature enough to prepare an acceptable economic
evaluation), it was expected that disbursement delays encountered in earlier
projects would be reduced.
4.2   The accent during appraisal was, therefore, on analysis of the 1983-1986
program as a whole and, having determined that it was justified, on the
methodology for selection of the individual sub-projects to be financed. DNV
would prepare for each sub-project, a technical and economic justification in a
basic data sheet which would include inbrmation on the rationale of the
proposed works, the design standards, the alternatives considered, the cost and
results of the economic evaluation, and the proposed tenderiDg schedule. A
minimum rate of return of 12% was required unless otherwise agreed by the
Bank. Acceptance of a sub-project as eligible, therefore, meant that the Bank
would, in principle, finance contracts related to it. Budget funds were allotted
by the Borrower, and the tender process was carried out in accordance with
Bank guidelines.
4.3   An analysis of the DNV's total investnent program showed that during
the years 1983 to 1986 an investment of $1,340 million would be made. Of
this, roughly $500 million was uncommitted, from which $470 was taken in the
Bank project, and, adding an investment of $90 million on provincial roads, a

program of $560 million was available over the 1983-1986 period. From this
sub-projects were selected for financing from the Bank loan. as detailed below:

4.4   The foreign exchange component of the 1983-1986 program, representing
about 45% of the total cost, was estimated at $250 million. The Bank loan of
$100 million was thus proposed to pick up 40% of the F.E, cost, or 18% of the
(1983-1986) program of $560 million.
4.5   The execution of the project was entrusted to the DNV, which would
also serve as the intermediary in the technical preparation, evaluation and
supervision of the provincial sub-projects. Each subproject would be governed
by an agreement ("convenio") between DNV  and the provinces.  Loan
repayments and interest from the provinces to DNV would be regulated under
this agreement, with the provision that DNV would have the right to deduct the
necessary amount from user taxes assigned to that province, if there was a
default in repayments to DNV.
4.6   A Special Account in Argentina, subject to audit by the Auditoria
General was made available for financing the Bank's share of the project cost.
ks against a Standard Disbursement Profile of a seven and one-half year period
prepared by the Bank for Argentina, a disbursement period of four years, was,
optimistically, considered appropriate for this project.

HIGHWAY SECTOR PROJECT
PROJECT COMPLETION REPORT
S.    Project Implementation
5.1   Loan Effectiveness and Project Start Up. The project was appraised
in February-March 1981, negotiated in April 1983 and approved by the Board
on May 31, 1983 (para 2.03). The Loan Agreement however was not signed
till January 31, 1984. The delay occurred mainly because elections were
scheduled in November 1983 and the goverunent was reluctant to proceed with
the loan signing. After the new government came into power, a presidential
decree was issued in December 1983 approving the loan documents and
authorizing the Transport minister to nominate a representative to sign the loan.
However, the Bank had already started sending missions to expedite matters,
and actually four short missions were fielded from Board approval date in May
1983 to Loan Effectiveness in August 1984. These missions supervised the
ongoing Fourth Highway Project and also reviewed the status of the Road User
Charges Study, initiated as part of the recommendations of the Nauonal
Transport Plan. The missions began to look at the first editions of the
evaluation sheets of proposed sub-projects and to give suggestions to make the
evaluations more meaningful. As a result, by April 1984, economic evaluations
of 22 road sections of the national program were ready, of which 21 vwere
approved in the field. In addition, eight sections for the provincial program
were evaluated.
5.2   Project Eecution.  In as far as the road betterment program  is
concerned, a chronological account of the important steps in the execution of the
civil works is given in Table 4 for the national program, and Table S for the
provincial program. It is noted from these tables that in some cases there were
substantial delays in the execution of the civil works. Initial delays occurred
due to the borrower's untfimliarity with the process of preparing evaluations for
the investments, and because DNV took some time to understand the difference
between a project loan and the sector fornat which required a different approach
and preparation. Once the advantages of the Sector format, which permitted
financing of all economically justifiable projects falling partly or entirely within
the 4-year time slice, were appreciated, it proved very effective. It allowed
DNV to qualify for financing from the loan, during the period in question, a
larger portion of works than the loan could accommodate if the entire value of
these contracts were to be financed by the loan. Thus the National Road
component was disbursed larely on schedule, even though some contracts were
delayed. A major cause of delay in the provincial works was the requirement
(not foreseen at appraisal) of passing a provincial law in each province to
authorize the commitment of funds. Later, delays were caused due the lack of
availability of couwerpart funds for the National Works, and in case of the
provincial progrm, for paucity of funds as well as for delays in the transfer of
klowhow from the DNV to the provincial authorites. For the national works,

out of a total of 44 works 36 were completed by the time the PCR was written,
whereas the remainng 8 were in various stages of completion, rated at above
70%. Fourteen works out of 36 completed were finished approximately within
the time forecast, whereas 10 were completed within an additional period of
10%. 6 between 50% and 100% additional time, and 6 in 100% or more
additional time.
5.3   For the provincial works only 2 out of 27 works were completed in time
(one ahead of time) whereas the rest were finished with considerable delays
ranging from 50% to 300%. Out of a total of 27 subprojects in the 13
provinces, which decided to participate in the project, 20 were completed up to
the time of writing of the PCR, 3 were completed 70% or above, and of the
remaining 4, one was reinitiated in 1992 (outside the scope of this project)
whereas 3 were cancelled. Most of the funds not utilized pertain exclusively to
provincial works. The poor performance in regard to provincial works was due
to:
(a)   Inadequate capacity of some of the provinces to underake the
project civil works in time;
(b)   Lack  of familiarity  in  the  provinces  with  regard  to
implementation of Bank projects;
(c)   Delays in the preparation of economic evaluations data for the
candidate projects;
(d)   Delays in the authorization of provincial loans to implement
projects;
(e)   Marked deterioration in the economies of the provinces,
particularly during the later stages;
(f)   Dastic reductions in budgetary allocations as a consequence of
the deterioration of the national economy; and
(g)   Impact of hyper-inflation and uncertanties in the rate of
exchange.
5.4   The Bank  supervision missions noticed  the delays in project
implementaion due to insufficient unde g of the sector concept and
iadequate tansfr of  nical knowhow to the provinces. To improve the
tansfer of technology to the provinces, a seminar suggestd by the Bank was
arranged in which staff and officials of the provinces were insucted in project
evaluauion and implementation as appl3ed to sector projects. This improved
matters somewhat but performance and implemenaion of Part B of the project
pertaining to provincial works remained poor due to the deteriorating conditon
nf tbhe eDnnmv of the countrv in aeneral- and the provinces in particular.

HIGHWAY SECTOR PROJECT
PROJECr COMPLETION REPORT
5.5   The Program for the procurement of equipment. although a relatively
minor component of the project ($1.0 million) was not implemented. Initially,
difficulties surfaced in regard to the preparation of specifications for the
procurement of traffic counters and related equipment such as dynamic scales.
as the Bank was in favor of specifying molern "state of the art" equipment
whereas the Argentine authorities wanted to procure locally manufactured
equipment. When specifications were finally agreed upon and bids invited, only
two offers were received and the tender was cancelled. Later, this program
became a victim of the deteriorating economy of the country, and procurement
action was shelved, due to shortage of funds.
5.6   The technical assistance part of the project had two components: (i) the
strengthening of the DNV; and (ii) assistance to the DNPT, subsequently
reorganized and renamed the (SSTP). The program for the DNV started slowly
but three important studies were conducted dealing with the improvement of
bridges, maintenance systems for highways, and a study dealing with monitoring
of maintenance concessions. The seminar to improve the transfer of technology
from the DNV to the provinces (para 5.04) was also financed from the Bank
loan. The Technical Assistance Program for the DNPT/SSTP aimed at
implementation and follow-up of several of the recommendations of the NTP,
was more an adequately implemented  and included, inter alia a group of
studies related to the transport of grains, the port of Bahia Blanca, several
studies related to urban transport in major cities, and a study concerning
financing of the transport sector. The technical assistance program was effective
in as much as the studies (Table 7) highlighted actions to be taken in regard to
several of the principal issues in the transport sector, helped define a long term
plan for the highways and clarified the strategy for restructuring the railway
sysrem.
5.7   Project Costs. In a sector project of this type in which a part of a time
slice of the country's highway program is financed, the project cost varies as it
depends upon the number and costs of projects eventually selected for financing.
Therefore, the real test of whether the project was well executed, is to check
whether the individual t.omponents had adequate rates of reurn, and to see how
the final costs compared with the original estimates as foreseen on the date of
evaluation, given the state of the economy, the inflation rates, etc. The
estimated and final costs for the national and provincial vorks are given in
Tables 4 and 5. Thiese tables also give some indication of the work done, and
the estimated time versus the actual time taken. A summary of project costs
indicating the actual costs vis-a-vis the appraisal estimates (in this case the sum
of the costs of the evaluated sub-projects) is given below:

PROJECT COMPLETION REPORT
5.8   Analysis of costs in Argentine is a difftcult task not only because of high
inflation rates but also because the parity between the US Dollar and the Peso
or Austral was unevenly maintained, with marked fluctuations in certain years.
As a result, due to the hyper-inflation in Argentina during the project period and
the distortions introduced while converting Argentine Pesos/Australs into US
Dollars, the actual costs given in the above table can only be treated as
indicative. Nevetheless, it is seen from the above that considering the overall
position of the project, the actual costs were 16.5% higher than appraisal
estimates, the increase being largely on account of the inflation in dollars. For
the civil works alone, costs were 16.7% higher, being 22.5% higher for the
natonal worls, and 4.4% higher for the provincial works. Considering that
these cost increases were largely on account of the inflation in dollars, these can
hardly be considered to be cost-over-rns. Bank participation at $90.36 million
was 24.7% instead of 28.9% when the projects were evaluated.
5.9   Disbursement. Table 3 gives the Estimated and Actual Schedule of
Disbursements. Disbursements actually started in the first half of FY85, ending
December 31, 1984, against the appraisal estimated start nearly one year earlier.
By the initial Closing Date of December 31, 1987 only about $ 69.8 million out
of $100 million had been disbursed. Tw extnsions of the Loan Closing date
were made, first to December 31, 1988 and then to December 31, 1989.
Delays in disbursements were largely due to an overoptimistic implementation
scheduled in the SAR, budget constraints and the special factors that delayed the
implementation of the provincial program (para 5.03). The final disbursement
was made on May 29, 1990. Of the loan of $100 million, $90.36 million was
disbursed,. and $ 9.64 million cancelled.
6.    Project Results
6.1   Project Objectives. The main objectives of this project were largely
achieved in as much as the progressive implementation of a comprehensive
strategy for the tansport sector was started by linking investments in the DNV's
and provinces' road investment programs to technical assistance aimed at
strengtening the operational and policy planning capabilities of the DNV and
DNPTISSTP. The major part of the imvestments in the national highways were
well ex cuted, albeit with delays. These delays were caused largely by the
economic problems faced by the country and the frequent changes in the
government which made it difficult for the project to be pursued in a susained
and consistent manner.
6.2   The provincial component of the project, however, although inadequately
implemented for reasons detailed in para 5.03, focussed attention on the
problems of the provices. These were taken up in the Provincial Development
Project (Loan 3280-AR) appraised in November 1990, and in the follow up
highway project. From the institutional viewpoint, it was learnt during the



LOAN 2296-AR                  - 13 -
HIGHWAY SECTOR PROJECT
PROJECT COMPLETION REPORT
project that the prevailing duplication of responsibilities for similar highway
activities between the National and Provincial agencies, managing separate
networks. was inefficient, and led to improper planning, and non-optimal use
of resources and installed capacity. These issues were recognized in the Bank's
Transport Sector work published in October 1988, and the Government
embodied most of the recommendations of the Bank in its current sector policies
as reflected in Decree 616/92 issued on April 10, 1992. This decree basically
established that the role of the DNV would henceforth be one of technical
leadership, planning, allocation of financial resources, supervision of
concessions, research and standardization, training, etc. The actual execution
of the national road works and related activities would be delegated to the
DPVs. A program for the implementation of this change was included in the
Road Maintenance and Rehabilitation Sector Loan appraised in 1992. It is
important to note that although the provincial component of the project was not
executed well, its lack-lustre implementation, in itself, led to serious
reorganization of the institutional set-up, and a gradual improvement of the
highway operations through decentalization and delegation of more work and
responsibility to the provinces.
6.3 Economic Re-evaluation. As the project had a sectorial nature (para.
4.01), during project implementation, DNV prepared for each national as well
as provincial subproject, a technical and economic evaluation, summarized in
a basic data sheet agreed at negotiations. This data sheet included information
on the rationale of the proposed works, the design standards, the alternatives
considered, the cost, and the results of the economic evaluation. During the
course of the project, the Bank reviewed these evaluations and if found
acceptable (an estimated ERR of 12% was rquired as a minimum), the
subproject was declared eligible. The ex-post evaluation was carried out using
the same data sheet and original methodology (Tables 8 and 9) but, as there was
no economic evaluation at the time of apprisal of the individual road sections
eventually included in the program, the ex-post results of each subproject were
compared with the evaluation carried out at the time that subproject was
declared eligible.
6.4  In the ex-post evaluation of national roads, all sections, except one (ERR
= 10%) if time's savings are included and two (ERRS = 6% and 9%)
otherwise, show ERR's greater than 12%, ranging from 14% to 50%. Three-
quarters of the national subprojects which were evaluated, rsulted in higher
economic indices of the ex-post evaluation as compared with the original one.
In the ex-post evaluation of provwincial roads, sixty-five percent of the
subprojects evaluated have ERRs greater than 12%, ranging from 12% to 43%.
In the rest, the prvincial roads show ERRs in the order of 8 - 10% with one
exception that has ERR of only 3 %. Fifty percent of the prvincial subprojects
which were evaluated showed ex-post economic results better than the original
evlation. Atble 8 presents the geal results of the economic re-evaluation
for the National Works and Tlble 9 for the Provincial Works. These results are
grouped into two general categores:  orginal evaluation, at the time the



LOAN 2296-AR                    - 14 -
HIGHWAY SECTOR PROJECT
PROJECT COMPLETION REPORT
subprojecEs were selected, and ex-post evaluation, and in each category
benefit/cost ratios and economic rates of return. both with and without road
user's time savings, are included.
6.5   For the economic analyses, reliable traffic data was used for national
roads. as DNV carries out proper traffic counts all over the national network.
Out of 44 national subprojects, seventy percent (31 subprojects) showed in 1988
positive traffic growths averaging 1.5% to 3% per year, while the rest had
significant declines. During project implementation, it became evident that
trafflc data for provincial roads had, in general, various deficiencies, and the
technical assistance program of the Road Maintenance and Rehabilitaiior Sector
Project (para. 9.02) aims to appropriately strengthen this important area for
provincial road planning.
7.    Sustainability
7.1   Although the period of implementation of this project was marked by
severe economic problems and political instability which led to delays in the
execution of the project, the macroeconomic and political conditions have tended
to improve and stabilize during the last few years. The major institutional
reforms which have been introduced during this period (para. 6.02) also augur
well for the realization of the full potential benefits of the project. Thus, as
long as timely financing for road maintenance is available, and good road
maintenance management continues, the level of net benefits through the
economic life of the project would remain acceptable. With the $756.0 million
Road Maintenance and Rehabilitation Project appraised in 1992, covering the
four year tranche, from 1993 to 1997, of extensive periodic road maintenance
and works, as well as providing for contractual routine maintenance and
significant amount of technical assistance for institutional improvement, the
perspective is positive.  A significant amount of technical assistance for
institutional imnprovement of the DPVs is expected to improve their maintenance
capabilities which would tend to also preserve the investments made on
provincial roads.
8.    Bank Performance
8.1 With 153 staffdays spent in the field on the preparation and appraisal of
the project, and 300 staffdays on the supervision (Table 11), this was a carefully
prepared and vigorously supervised project. Review of supervision reports
indicates particularly intense supervision missions from 1986 onwards, and
greater attention to the lagging subprojects in the provinces and the technical
assistance component. In general, throughout project implemenation the Bank's
operational staff in the field, supported by divisional and departmental
management, performed well, suppordng the Borrower's executing agencies
who expenenced considerable difficulties due to economic and politcal
problems. The provincial program remained inadequate in implementation, but
was fruitful in regard to the lessons drawn from it in respect of the insdtutional



LOAN 21296-AR                 - 15 -
HIGHWAY SECTOR PROJECT
PROJECT COMPLETION REPORT
and organizational set-up of the highway administration at the centre and the
provinces (para 6.02).
9.    Borrower's Performance
9.1   Borrower performnance was mixed. This was the first sector project in
the highway sector in Argentine and therefore, its preparation and
implementation was substantially different to the conventional transport projects.
Secondly, the project had a national component and in addition a significant
provincial component in which the provincial and regional offices were required
to play an important role. Thirdly, in the aftermath of the NTP, significant
policy and institutional changes had to be introduced in regard to invesUnent
planning, road user charges, and the organizational set up of the DNV, and
DNPT/SSTP in the centre and the DPVs in the provinces. Finally the macro
economic conditions of Argentina affected implementation adversely.
9.2   During implementation, the Borrower was initially slow to react to the
sector format of the project, in as much as there were delays in the preparation
of sub-project evaluations and the execution of civil works (para 5.02).
Although these problems were overcome for national projects, delays and hold
ups continued for the provincial projects in which a substantial part of the loan
remained undisbursed (para 5.07). These latter delays were due not only to
economic difficulties leading to delays and cuts in budget allocations, but also
due to inadequate transfer of technology and knowhow to the provinces from the
centre. The political and economic problems began to resolve after the Menem
Government took charge in July 1989 and introduced its reform programs in
1991, with the aid of the IMF and the World Bank. The policy and institutional
reforms started during this project weie continued in a series of projects,
notably the Bank's Transport Sector Public Enterprises Project (October 1988),
the Provincial Development Project (November 1990), and the Road
Maintenance and Rehabilitation Sector Project (presented to the Board in June
3, 1993).
10.   Project Relationships
10.1 This project was implemented during a period of eight years during
which both the Bank's project officers and the borrower's officials, notably the
General Administrator of the DNV and the responsible under secretary in the
Govermnent changed several times. Some delays in processing documents and
unexplained interruptions are noticed in the project files. However these were
relatvely minor, and, by and large, the dialogue between the Bank and the
Borrower was maintained. The relationship between the Bank on one side and
the DNV, SSTP and the DPVs was generally good and was strengthened by the
regular bank missions which generally sought to resolve difficulties and hold
Ups.

HIGHWAY SECTOR PROJECT
PROJECT COMPLETION REPORT
11.   Consulting Services
11.1 Technical assistance was slow in starting but the various studies (Table
7) were completed with the full participation of the Bank in providing comments
and reviews of wGrk done by consultants. These studies, each limited in its
scope, helped define policy and priorities in regard to the improvement of
transport activities in Argentina, to work out long term plans for the highways,
and to clarify the strategy for restructuring of the railway system.
12.   Project Documentation and Data
12.1 The Staff Appraisal Report was the basis for framing the legal documents
and provided the take-off point for the detailed terms of reference for the
consulting services and for the supervision of the civil works. Given the
eventual duration of the project, the changes in Bank supervision teams, changes
in the Government and the Borrower's management, the SAR also provided, in
a sense, the frame of reference concerning the project origins, and for
additionslalterations to the project content which ensured that the basic scope
and format of the project were maintained.
12.2 Periodic reports from the Borrower were received regularly although
often with delays. These have been useful for observing the progress of the
project. As most of the Borrower's officials and staff who worked on the
project have since retired or left, it has been difficult to obtain some of the data
required. However, the notes and tables concerning the project provided by the
Borrower in October 1992 and later in February and March 1993 give some of
the importan infbrmation pertaining to the project, which together with the
supervision reports and the corresondence in the project files, enabled the
preparation of a composite picture of the project for this report.

Dear M. Sanchez:
I am pleased to tansmit to you my comments on Sections I and m of the
Fifth Sectoral Project, sent on Apdl 23, 1993.
There is a general coincidence regrdig the performance of each stage.
Particularly, I want to emphasize the coinience regarding:
(a)  the degree of performance achived in each stage, despite the econonmc
and polidcal difficulties the country went dough during the Loan period;

(b)   the reasons for the delays at the beginning of the works;
(c)   the results obtained. among which deserve mentioning the guidelines for
the Argentine road sector reorganization, outlined in Decree 823/89 for road
Reconversion, and Decree 616/92 redefining the organization, missions and
functions of the National Highway Directorate;
(d)   the prospects of political and economic improvement, through the reform
started by the National Government at the end of 1989.
I also interpret that one can infer from the document that the tasks
performed under this Fifth Loan have left a highly positive balance for all
parties concerned: the World Bank and, especially, the Provincial Highway
Ditorates and the National Highway Directorate since all of them have
received valuable lessons for their organization and functioning. On the part of
this Agency, the experience will permit facing with greater optimism and drive
the responsibilities of the Sixth Loan whose negotiation is soon to be finalized.
Finally, I wish to express my satisfaction for the high evaluation made
of the results obtained in this Fifth Loan and, particularly, for having come
ftom such highly qualified professionals.
