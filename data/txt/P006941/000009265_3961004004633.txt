MEMORANDUM AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT
OF TEE INTERNATIONAL BANK FOR RECONSTUCTION AND
DEVELOPMENT TO TRE EXECUTIE DIRECTORS
ON A PROPOSE LOAN TO TIE NCOSTARRICENSE DE
ACUEDUCTOS Y ALCANTARILLADO (AyA) WTfH TIHE GUARANTEE OF
THE REPUBLIC OF COSTA RICA
FOR THE SECOND WATER SUPPLY AND SEWERAGE PROJECT
1.    I submit for your approval the following memorandum and recommendation on a proposed
loan for US$26 million equivalent to the Instituto Costarricense de Acueductos y Alcantartilado (AyA)
with the guarantee of the Republic of Costa Rica. The loan would be repayed over 17 years
including 4 years of grace at the Bank's variable interest rate and standard charges.
2.       houd: 'Me Govemment of Costa Rica has embarked on an ambitious restructuing
program to lay the basis for sustained economic growth. In pursuit of this goal, the Government's
development strateg focuses on: (i) accelerating integration into the world economy; (ii) streamlining
and restructuring the public sector to improve its efficiency, strengten its financial base, and reorient
it away from activities that can be carried out more efficiendy by the private sector; (iii) improving
efficiency and competition in labor, financial and capital markets; (iv) improving nfastructure and
encouraging private sector imvestment to accelerate growth and diversify the economy's export base;
(v) caneling social spending and programs to those in greatest need, while improving coverage and
efficiency; and (vi) protectng natural resources.
3.    In the water and sewerage sector, Costa Rica has made significant progress in the past two
decades in cxpandin its water supply and sitation services and this is reflected in very high service
coverage levels that rank among the highest in Latin America. Nevertheless, there are still major
issues in the sector that the Government is commited to address in coherence with the above
development strategy. Among them are: (i) improving sector efficiency; (d) strengthening the
sector's financial base; and (iii) sector decenalization, seeking expanded prvate sector participation.
TO achieve these objectives, it is necessary to define an appropriate regulatory fiamework and
improve the organizational and operational arrangements for the provision of water and sewerage
services so as to avoid unnecesary duplications and overlap of responsibilities between sector
agencies (AyA is the most important sector agency serving 70% of the ttal population); improve
productivity, particularly by reducing water losses and personnel; define and implement sound
investment and cost recovery policies to sengthen sector finances, reducing dpendence on
Govemment subsidies and fincing; and improve the operation of the existing water and sewerage
systems. The proposed project would support achieving all these objectives.
4.    In November 1991, the Bank completed a Water Supply and Sanitation Sector Overview
(Report No. 10070-CR) which identified the above sector issues and included recorans for
improving AyA's operational and finacial efficiency.  h rveport was disssed with Govenmen
authorities and a seminar was held in March  992 wiparticipation of allentities involved in the
water sector. As a result of these dicsions and as a basis for project impltat    the
Govenment has pred to the Bank a National Water Supply and Saiation Policy Statment
outlining sector policies and goas, Institutional reform goals, watet quality taget, financing poicies,
and the goals of improvement and expansion of water and seragoe sevice.
S.    The Government has also been ttying to improve AyA's operational efficiency and promote
its financal sef-sufficieancy. Thus, AyA initiated in 1990 a program to reduce its high lvels of water



10880 (UFW) mainly in the San Jose Metropolitan Area (SJMA) of 49% and AyA has been reducing
the number of employees by restricting new entries and cuttng 200 positions through a labor
reduction program.
6.    Sector investments requirements during 1993-2001 will more than double historical averages
(0.6% of GDP), mainly to address sanitation and environmental issues, and since Governent
participation in the grant financing of sector investments is likely to ebb (param 3), a more aggressive
strategy to recover costs and imprcwe efficiency of opeaions will be implemend under the project.
In the past, virtustly all sector investment have been fimded with Government grants or foreign
loans, mainly from hnter-American Development Bank (IDB). Setting a sound cost recovery policy is
very important, both for AyA's financial soundness and access to future fncing, and to lay the
basis for future private sector involvement in the sector.
7.    Untl 1991, tariffs were insufficient to cover AyA's operating and mabienance expenses and
debt service obligations. In December 1991, AyA with Bank assistamce prepared a proposal for tariff
increases which was approved by the Servicio Nacional de Electricidad (SNE), the regulatory body,
in March 1992. Under this program, by July 1993 tariff will have been increased by 35% in real
terms over their levels of April 1992. These tariff levels, adjusted annually to offset inflation, would
permit AyA to cover its opeaional costs and debt service, as well as to generat sufficient cash to
contribute about 22% to its 1993-2001 investment program, provided the envisaged project
pefmane and cost control mesures are also implemented.
8.    Rainale      r Banl  mnt: The Bank assistance strategy for Costa Rica seeks to
consolidate an ongoing process of sLtjcaual adjustment, now focusing on public sector reform, to lay
the basis for private sector led growth, and to support the continmed implemention of poverty
alleviation and environmental programs. Coniuing Bank involvement in the sector would assist the
Govenment define more precisely its development policies for the water and sanitation sector, as well
as to implement the required policy and insional reforms. In addition, it will spport the
im provement of efficiency and finances of sector instituions, in order to reduce their depndce on
Govenment subsidies, at a ime when investment requirements are high and govement resources
are limited. Since the sector would condinue to rely significanty on EDB financing, Bank involvement
would conenrt on helping to define sound sector policies, financig invesmes and technical
assistance fbr the overall improvement of AyA's opertonal efficiency, and insttional s _trngthening
and improvement of the water supply and sewerage services in the SJMA. Finally, hough its
chairmansip of the Consultaive Group for Costa Rica the Bank would ampt to coordinate bilateral
and multlatea asistance to the sector and promote the achievement of the Governmens objecives.
9.    Eojc QbjeBiva: The proposed project has four major objectives: (a) help the Government
and AyA to strengfthn the institonal famework for the provision of water and sewerage services in
the country, including promotion of private sector participation and develop and implement sound
sector policies; (b) support AyA in carrying out an instuional and finacial restruct     strateg, to
increase effliciency in operations and achieve and consolidate financal viability; (c) improve the
quality of water supply operations in the SJMA; and (d) improve the SIMA sewerage service, mainly
in poor areas.
10.   Pro1eWM Desc igtion: lhe project would include the following     ofiv mponents: (a) Xa
iNWOnW2"      ni   g i gam  (9% of total project cost) cludes tecni  assistance, equiPIet
and staff training for: (i) developing and implemendng Improved sector policies and insonal



-3 -
framework for the sector; (ii) improving AyA!s financial management and corporate planning; and
(iii) decentralizing AyA's actvities taking into account private sector partiipation and possibilities for
operating costs reduction; (b) the Unacued-for-Water pnrogam    (42%) includes technical
assintce, eq I  and staff taining mainly for: (i) metering; (ii) commercial system
improvement; Oii) updating of consumer and pipes cadastres; and (iv) operational control of the
SJMA water system; (c) th SJMA water sippy and distdbtiion     n    (33%) includes civil
works, equipment and consultancy services for the construcdon of four wehs, pipe distribution
facilities, storage tanks and pumping stations; (d) the SJMA rehabilitaion sneage mpnt (10%)
includes civil works, equipment and consulancy services for: (i) the rehabilitation of sewage
collectors and pumping stations; and (ii) construction of sewage collectors in a poor neighborhood of
the SJMA to improve its environmental conditions; and (e) the gpesaons and -mga_ee
(6%) includes civil works, equipment and technical assistance for: (i) operation and maintenan  of
sewerage systems; and (ii) rehabilitation of the Orosi pipeline (financed under Loan 1935-CR).
11.   The total project cost is esimaed at US$40.0 million equivalent, with a foreign exchange
component of US$26.0 million equivalent (65%). The proposed Loan would finance the foreign
exchange portion of total project cost, net of taxes with the remaining funding coming from AyA's
internal cash generation. Schedule A shows a brekdwn of project costs and the finaning plan.
Amounts and methods of procurement and of disbursement, and the disbursement schedule, are shown
in Schedule B. A timetable of key project processing events and the Stawus of Bank Group operatons
in Costa Rica are given in Schedule C and D, respectively. The Staff Appraisal Report No. 11440-
CR dated May 25, 1993 is also attached. To avoid delays in implemention of high priority
technical assistance, retroactive financing of up to US$0.3 million, eqivalent to 1% of the loan
proceeds, is recommended for expenditures incurred after September 30, 1992.
12.   Proec: The proposed project is expected to be implementd in six years.
The execuing agency will be AyA. Detailed designs are available for most of the works included in
tht projec. The overall coordination and supervision of project implementation would be carried out
by the Planning Department (PD) of AyA. A set of operational and financial targets, as well as
performance indicators to assess project progress and AyA's performance have been agreed during
negotiations and would be monitored during annual and mid-term reviews.
13. Project Sustainabilit: Project sustainability would depend on Government and AyA's
continued commi  to: (i) strengthening the institutional framework for the provision of water and
sewerage services in the country, including promotion of private sector participation and developing
and implementig sound sector policies; (ii) increasing efficiency in operations and achieving and
consolidating finmca viability; and (iii) implementing a sounder regulatory framework for public
utilities which the proposed project supports in coordination with the recently approved third
Structura Adjustment Loan (Loan 3594-CR). Upfront actions already taken should strengthen
sustainability prospects.
14.   Lessognsr m Past Exeri     Bank involvement In the sector has been limited so far to the
San Jose Water Supply Project (Loan 1935-CR approved in 1980), which financed the construction of
the Orosi water scheme that has solved the problem of water rationing in the SJMA. The Project
Completion Report (No. 9166 of November 1990) shows that while the physical targets of the project
were achieved with some delays, the project did not achieve all insional objectives, mainly
because of major managerial problems. Nevertheless, the Project helped identify the causes of the



- 4-
high levels of UFW, thus faciliatng the fonmulation of the UFW program to be suppoiied under this
proposd project.
15.   The Bank's experience in the w-.t and sanitation sector In Costa Rica and in other counties,
indicates that for a successful project: (i) a sound connection between the insutional and physical
objectives of the project should be established; (ii) demand and productivity projectons should have a
sound basis; and (iii) special attention should be placed on cost recovery and cash generation issues to
ensure expected revenues and linkage with the operational performance. The proposed project's
design addresses all these lessons.
16.   Actions Aregd:        2"atio, nnSagreements were reached: (A) with the Goverm t
and AyA on: (a) sectoral goals and policy objectives; (b) the terms of reference and timetable for the
study and implemenation of the investmeat and cost recovery policies; (c) the terms of reference and
timetable for the study and implementation of the institutional framework for the GAM; and (d) the
tems of reference and timetable for the study and imple on of the isitutional framework of
the sector; and (B) with AyA on: (a) mantaning at all times senior managers whose qualifications
and experience shall be satisfactory to the Bank; (b) the timetable for the preparation and
implementation of a decentralization model including 100% subcontracdng with the private sector in
all areas or functions identified in the mentioned model; (c) the timetable for the study and
implementaion of the o tional and engineering measures to protect the 0rosi pipeline; (d) the
timetable for the study and implemention of the commercial system; (e) project performance would
be evaluated in accordance with agreed operational and fnancial targets and defied monitorg
implementing dates; (t) the timetable for the study and implementation of the accounting system; (g)
the following, which would be reviewed during annual an mid-term reviews: (i) AyA's financa
projections for the following six year period; and (ii) AyAls six-year investment plan and the
project's investment program; (h) not approve or commit any new investment in excess of US$
500,000 equivalent without supportng evidence satisfactory to the Bank; (i) mantaning the PD with
unctions, structure and staffing satisfactory to the Bank; 0) maintaig the Technical Committee of
UFW and its secretaria pmaey with functions and staffing satisfictory to the Bank; (k) holding
annual reiews and a mid term review in September of every year and by no later than September 30,
1996, respectively, of the progms made in achieving the project objectives and, if necessary, prepare
and execut, to the sasfacdon of the Bank, remedial actions and as a consequence of these reviews
and if the Bank shall so recommend, submit to SNE a proposal for tariff adjustmens and take any
corrective actions; and 0) speci provisions to be followed regarding ICB and LCB procedures.
Condidos lffgl&nW    would be: (a) satisfactory implementaion of AyAs water program of
monthly tariff increas; (b) the appointment of adeqate staff in the PD would have been completed;
(c) signature of the agreement between AyA and PAHO; and (d) completion of the   rdie
bidding docume. Eves ofht would be that: (a) SNE shall have not reviewed and gaed
approval witin 75 days to AyA's tariff requests; (b) Government shall have not enacted legislation,
adopting a comprehensive regulatory framework for public services in Costa Rica and the regulations
related to such legislat  and an action plan to restructre SNE in accordance widt its new functions;
and (c) SNE's resuctuing plan has not been implemented in accordance with its terms and
timetable.
17.   E.wionmental A     : Ihe project is rated B. The environmental impact assment caried
out for the proposed project does not idendfy negative impacts, apart from minor dsubances durng
work construction. In order to minimize these effects migating measures wil be included in the
constuction contracts. According to this assessment, the project will have important positive



- 5 -
environmental impacts as it will reduce the pollution level in the rivers and streams that ru through
San Jose, and greatly improve the aesthetic and sanitary enviromnent of approximately 27,000 people
in low-income areas through the provision of sewerage services. The project wiU also cover
sewerage works that are integred within the GAM Sewerage Master Plan (PLAMAGAM) which is
designed to control waste water pollution in the GAM in the near fture.
18.   Pover; Alluviatin: The proposed project will have a positive poverty alleviation Impact on:
(i) low-income segments of the San Jose population through the construction of sewerage in areas
where earnings of almost 90% of the population are below the legal minimum wage; and (ii) the
lowest income households in non-urbanized areas located along the river and creek banks, as it will
reduce the pollution levels in these streams.
19.   Poect Benefits The project would seek to achieve a framework of clearly defined and
sound sector policies and institutional arrangements to enhance its sustainabity. It would yield
important economic, financial, environmental and health benefits. Economic benefits include: (i)
decreased operational costs resulting from the increase of staff productivity, the optimization of the
production capacity and the reduction of water losses (physical and commercial); (iH) reducing the
isks to which the Orosi pipeline is exposed; and (iii) increased revenues from water and sewerage
saes, resulting mostly from additional connections as well as from increased rates. Financial
benefits would arise from an improved tariff structure and better collection that will reduce AyAs
dependence on Government transfers at a time when Government is strapped for funds.
Environmenta and health benefits will be achieved by alleviating the pollution of rivers and streams
that run through the SJMA and by improving the enviromental conditions of low-income areas.
20.   Poiect Risk: The main risks lie outside the project itself and are linked to possible slippage
in the governments commitment to re.orm the public sector and to implement a sounder regulatory
framework for public utilities, particularly after a new Administration takes office in May 1994. To
reduce this risk, significant actions were sought before appraisal and Board presentation. To reduce
the risk of future slippage, annmul reviews of project implementation would be undertaken with the
participation of authorities responsible for public sector reform. Specific project-related risks arise
from AyAls institutional weaknesses that constrain its ability to improve rapidly its overall operational
performance. To reduce this risk, specific operational and financial targets to measure AyA's
performance will be closely monitored. A potential additional risk arises from possible access to
extnl financing without adequate attention to the need of improving sector performance. To
address this issue, the Bank is mamaining a close dialogue with the IlDB, the other major multilateral
donor in the sector, to coordinate positions on sector policies and priority issues.
21.   Recommendadon: I am satisfied that the proposed loan complies with the Articles of the
Agreement of the Bank and recommend that the Executive Directors approve it.
