MEMORANDUM AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT
OF THE INTERNATIONAL DEVELOPMENT ASSOCIATION
TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS
ON A PROPOSED CREDIT
TO THE PEOPLE'S REPUBLIC OF CHINA
FOR THE SHAANXI AGRICULTURAL DEVELOPMENT PROJECT
1.        The following memorandum and recommendation on a proposed Credit of
SDR 78.8 million (US$106 million equivalent) to the People's Republic of China
is submitted for approval. The proposed Credit, which would help finance the
Shaanxi Agricultural Development Project, would be on standard IDA terms, with
35 years maturity.
2.          Background.   Agriculture in China,  including crops,  livestock,
forestry and fisheries, provides sustenance to over one billion, people, is a
major source of income for some 190 million farm families, and accounts for
about 35Z of the country's GDP. Major revisions in farm policies since 1979,
most importantly, a shift from collective to household-managed farming and
substantial increases in farm prices, have led to rapid growth and
diversification in agricultural production. Over the period 1980-85, production
increased by 102 per year compared to an average of 32 per year in the preceding
23 years. Grain output reached a record 407 million tons in 1984, 342 greater
than in 1978, despite a reduction in area sown to grain. In 1985, the Government
begun a new phase of reform, replacing mandatory procurement quotas with
voluntary contracts, adjusting procurement prices, and greatly enlarging the role
of the market. These measures, and the price fluctuations resulting from them,
contributed to a decline in grain and cotton output and hectarage as farmers
shifted production into higher-priced cash crops and livestock. Grain production
fell from the 1984 high to 379 million tons in 1985 and 391 million tons in 1986.
3.        Objectives for agriculture during the 7th Five-year Plan (1986-1990)
are to maintain per capita grain consumption at current levels while continuing
to diversify the overall output structure to accommodate changing consumer
preferences.   This means increasing food grain output  to match population
growth, boosting production of fruits, vegetables, meat, poultry, fish, and cash
crops, and expanding output of processed products. To achieve sector growth,
Chinese planners are supporting a series of systemic reforms which include: (a)
creating a regulatory framework consisting of price, taxation, credit, and legal
mechanisms to guide development of the rural economy; (b) allowing diverse forms
of enterprise ownership; and (c) over the medium term, reducing the scope of
contract procurement, reducing consumer subsidies, and increasing the role of
the market.  Emphasis is also being given to improvements in technology and
management which would lead to increased productivity of existing cropped areas
and efficient development of unused or underutilized land. Consistent with this
approach, water resources development policy has given priority to increasing
the efficiency of existing irrigation systems through completion and
rehabilitation of irrigation and drainage structures and improved water
management.   The Ministry of Water Resources and Electric Power projects
expansion of irrigated area by about eight million ha by the year 2000, mostly
through additions and improvements to existing schemes.



-2 -
4.        The Bank Group's strategy for lending in China's agricultural sector
has been to support the Government's objectives outlined above (para. 3).
Lending to date has included 18 operations involving a total assistance of about
US$1.6 billion for land development; support services including agricultural
training, research, credit and seed production; development of specialized
product subsectors including rubber, forestry and fisheries; and area development
projects combining crop and livestock production with locally operated agro-
industry investments to maximize value-added and employment. Implementation of
these projects is generally on schedule.   Future Bank Group lending would
continue to support projects in large and diverse subsectors, e.g. large scale
water resources development, livestock, afforestation and rural credit.
5.          Rationale for IDA Involvement.  The proposed project would aim to
raise farm production and income in one of China's poorest provinces.   This
would be achieved through expansion and improvement of irrigated area, raising
crop yields, increasing livestock and fish production, and developing the
agro-processing sector through pilot projects. The croject would also seek to
alleviate health problems through improved water Apply for human and animal
consumption. Apart from resource transfer, the major Bank Group contribution
to the project would be assistance in introducing state-of-the-art pump
technology and system layout, in designing and equipping large-scale poultry
operations,  and in setting up modern processing facilities.   Bank Group
involvement would also provide access to international experience in management
of large irrigation areas, varietal and breed improvement pr'grams, and product
marketing methods. Project- sponsored training and overseas study tours would
enable Chinese technicians and project staff to study firsthand alternative
technologies in irrigation, animal and plant breeding, and agribusiness.
6.          Proiect Ob1ectives.   The main objective of the proposed project
would be to boost farm production and incomes in the Shaanxi Province through
a program of investments in irrigation, other rural infrastructure, and in
agricultural services. Project activities would focus on 39 counties in the
central region which offer a broad spectrum of development opportunities. The
project would also provide secure and safe drinking water to some 130,000 people
in the northwestern county of Dingbian, one of the worst affected parts by poor
quality water of an otherwise poor province. Project objectives are in line with
the Government's strategy of making more efficient use of land and water
resources, diversifying primary production and improving the standards of rural
life.
7.             Project Description.   The proposed project would expand and
rehabilitate irrigation facilities, mainly for cultivation of grains (wheat,
corn, barley, etc), oilseeds, cotton, vegetables, fruits, and alfalfa. A seed
production and testing component aims to improve the availability of superior
seeds.  The project would develop freshwater fish culture in low-lying areas
along the Yellow and Wei Rivers. It would introduce large-scale poultry farming
and a genetic improvement program for swine and rabbits. Small agro-processing
facilities would be established to demonstrate proper methods to organize, manage
and finance upgraded processing, handling and storage facilities. The project
would also construct a new water supply system in Dingbian where contaminated
water has caused crippling disease. The main features of the projec* are:



-3 -
(a)   improvement  of irrigation ser-ing 123,000 ha and provision of
supplemental water supply for 156,000 people ir the Central region (Donglel II
area) through installation of 37 major pumping stations and construction of a
network of canals and drains;
(b) construction of potable water supply for 140 villages (130,000 people)
and irrigation systems (4600 ha) in Dingbian county, including installation of
three pumping stations and village level reservoirs;
(c)   establishment of 2,100 ha of fist, ponds, including. provision of
reliable water service, drainage, power supply. roads and, supporting facilities
such as hatcheries, feed mills and marketing and supply centers;
(d) establishment of 8 breeding farms and 5 commercial farms for poultry
and one breeding farm each for swipe and rabibits;
(e)   construction of nine seed pr3cessing and testing laboratories,
provision of modern processing and testing equipment, and supply of fertilizers
and other inputs; and
(f) construction and equipping of three agro-processing plants for meat,
fruit, and honey products and one cold storage facility.
8.         The project cost is estimated at US$237.5 million, with a foreign
exchange component of US$88.4 million (37.2%). The project, to be carried out
over 5 years, provides funds for civil works; pumping plant, transformers and
electrical equipment; poultry, seed processing, specialized transport and
construction equipment; fertilizer, steel and lumber; and technical assistance
and training. A breakdown of costs and the financing plan are shown in Schedule
A. Amounts and methods of procurement and of disbursements, and the disbursement
schedule are shown in Schedule B. Retroactive financing of up to US$7.0 million
would be made against expenditures made after January 1, 1989. A timetable of
key project processing events and the status of Bank Group operations in China
are given in Schedules C and D, respectively. A map is also attached. The Staff
Appraisal Report, No. 7475 dated March 1, 1989, is being distributed separately.
9.         Agreed Actions. To ensure effective implementation of the project,
the Government has agreed to the following: (a) an annual plan for provision
of chemical fertilizer would be prepared and submitted for review prior to
November 1 of each year; and (b) all effluents from agro-processing would be
treated and the Provincial Environmental Bureau would clear the final designs
of the treatment plants; the Bureau wvould set up a monitoring system to ensure
that effluent quality is maintained through the life of the project.
10.        Other actions that the Government would take  are as follows:  (a)
the provincial government would   present a plan acceptable to IDA for the
collection of water charges in Donglei and Dingbian areas at rates which would
recover all operations and maintenance costs and a portion of the capital costs;
(b) the provincial PMO would complete a review of Phase I of the poultry program
by December 31,1991 and would consult with IDA while planning for Phases II



and IIIt and (c) water quality would bo monitfred using standard health bureau
practices to observe the impLuvelmenlts in dLinking water supply.
12.         Benefits and Justiticat ion. At full development, the project would
inerease annual production by atbiut 300,000 tons ot wheat and other 3rains,
13,000 tons of oilseeds, 11,000 tons of cutton and cottonseed, 156,000 tons of
vegetables, apples and melons, 25,000 tons of fodder, 64,000 tons of eggs and
10,000 tons of poultry and oLher meats.  It would benefit 180,000 families,
provide an additional 65,100 full-time jotis and raise annual per capita incomes
of farm families from an average of Y290 to about Y800 and of full-time employees
engaged itn animal husbandry or agro-processing to about Y1000.  In addition,
fluoride-free water supply would enable 75,000 people who are suffering from
skeletal fluorosis to fully or partially recover from the crippling effects of
this disease.
13.         Risks. The project faces no unusual technical, organizational or
financial risks. For the irrigation and water supply components the agricultural
and water resources agencies involved in the project have had considerable
experience with irrigation and land developmenit projects including the nearby
Donglei I irrigation project.  The Shaanxi project office has performed well
during project preparation. The Shaanxi Water Conservancy Bureau is adequately
staffed with competent engineers and managers and has had several decades of
experience with construction, operation and maintenance of large-scale water
managem,nt systems. In addition, local farmers have considerable experience with
the crops to be grown and livestock to be raised. Markets are well organized
and reasonably efficient, demand seems to be strong and with the on-going price
reforms, prices have been rising and are unlikely to fall given the strong demand
situation. For the aquaculture component, the Division of Fisheries and Aquatic
Products within  Shaanxi's Bureau of Water Conservancy has demonstrated its
capability in implementation of similar projects in the province. The Shaanxi
Animal Husbandry Bureau has also demonstrated its capability to implement poultry
breeding schemes and its ability to train specialized households who are already
achieving high egg production yields.   The agro-processing technology to be
introduced for the cold storage and meat packing is of standard design and the
project should not pose major problems. To ensure effective technology transfer
for processing equipment, the project would have a program of local and overseas
training included in the project.
14.         Recommendation.  I am satisfied that the proposed Credit would comply
with the Articles of Agreement of the Association and recommend that the
Executive Directors approve the proposed credit.

/b As eredits are denominated in SDRs (since IDA Replenishment VI), undisbursed SDR credit
balances are converted to dollars at the current exchange rate between the dollar and th
SDR. In some cases, therefore, the undisbursed balance indicates a dollar amount greate
than the original principal credit amount expressed in dollars.
Note:  The status of the projects listed in Part A is described in a separate report on all
Bank/IDA financial projects in execution, which is updated twice yearly and circulate
