SUMMARY
    This Restructuring Paper (RP) introduces changes to the National Program Support
for Tax Administration Reform (NPSTAR) Project Appraisal Document (PAD) and its
accompanying legal document: loan agreement L7431-PH. The proposed changes are to:
i) include the revised results matrix with revised/reformulated project indicators and
targets; and ii) extend the closing date from December 31, 2011 to June 30, 2013. The
revision of some of the project indicators is to ensure that the performance of project
interventions is properly captured by relevant and available data sources (please see
section C below).


PROJECT STATUS
    During the first years of project implementation, progress in tax administration
reform was slow, in part due to frequent turnover in commissioners and an unsupportive
political environment. In mid-2009, project disbursements began to pick up and they have
accelerated substantially since a new administration took over in July 2010. A total of
US$1.58 million had been disbursed by end-2010. Twenty procurement packages have
been procured or are in the process of being contracted by end of December 2011. The
estimated cost of the 20 packages is US$5.7 million.

    Currently, actual disbursements stand at US$ 3.28 million. However, adding the
disbursed amount as of the end of 2010 and the contracted amount by end of 2011, the
total of disbursements and commitments as of end-December 2011 is projected to be
US$7.28 million, amounting to 66 percent of the loan amount of US$11 million. The
remaining uncommitted amount for the proposed extension period up to June 2013 would
be about US$3.72 million or 34 percent of the loan amount. The team is satisfied with the
performance of the BIR procurement system and is confident that it will be able to
complete the remaining packages as enumerated in the revised procurement plan
projected to June 2013 (see below).

       The project components remain as they were: a) tax compliance; b) tax
enforcement and control; c) human resource development and management; and d) BIR
management, change management and project management. Improvements in all these
four dimensions are needed and the activities to be funded from NPSTAR should
contribute to the achievement of the project’s development objective of improving


                                           4
compliance by enhancing the efficiency and effectiveness of BIR. For a list of activities
projects to be funded, please see Table 1 below.

PROPOSED CHANGES
Project Development Objectives

The PDO remains unchanged. It is “to increase taxpayer compliance by increasing the
efficiency and effectiveness of the BIR, and to prepare the BIR for a sustainable and long-term
reform.?


                                                  11
(a) Results/indicators. While the PDO is unchanged, some project indicators are now
    reformulated to better align to available data sources and incorporate a new agency-
    level Key Performance Indicators (KPI) on arrears management. Since the project
    timeline is now extended by additional 18 months, new targets are also included (See
    Annex 1 for a full list). In particular, the following changes are proposed:

(i)     Increase in commonly-shared internal and external expectations of reform
        accomplishments has been dropped and substituted with the following data
        available from BIR taxpayer surveys:

        •   Percent of respondents who said that BIR services have met their expectations
            in the ease of conducting transactions (target: 82 percent in 2012 from 79.5 in
            2010);

        •   Percent who said that BIR services have met their expectations in generating
            satisfying results (target: 87 percent in 2012 up from 85.2 in 2010);

(ii)    The target of “80 percent of staff indicates high level awareness and
        understanding of the reform? has been changed to “90 percent of BIR staff
        awareness of the projects involved in tax reform;?

(iii)   The target of “80 percent of taxpayers have correctly registered? has been
        changed to “registered taxpayers amount to 47% of the active labor force;?

(iv)    The indicator on “increase in the number of stop filer cases arising from
        erroneous/invalid registration information eliminated from registration database?
        has been changed to “percentage of filers over total registered taxpayers;?

(v)     The (2010) target of “80 percent of taxpayers in database file returns the
        following year? has been increased to 85 percent for 2012;

(vi)    The indicator on outstanding arrears has been supplemented with one on
        collections in a particular year or “year n? as a percentage of potentially
        recoverable arrears in the preceding year or “year n-1?(defined as those of three
        years and less maturity in line with the agency KPI) to improve performance
        measurement and align with a new agency-level KPI;

(vii) The “increase in the use of output and outcome indicators in internally
      management reports? has been changed to “use of operational indicators in BIR
      quarterly reports and of agency-level KPIs in BIR annual report.?

(b) Closing date. The new proposed closing date is June 30, 2013. This is the project’s
    first extension.

(c) Implementation schedule The Bank and BIR have agreed on an implementation cum
    procurement plan for the period of the proposed project extension. The plan includes
    mainly ICT and capacity-building activities. These are fully consistent with the
    project’s objectives and with BIR’s Strategic Plan (See Table 2 below). Support on
    institutional change and business process re-engineering will continue being
                                             12
    provided through the companion Public Revenue and Expenditure Review. The
    International Monetary Fund and the Millennium Challenge Corporation are also
    providing technical assistance to the reform program and the Bank team is working
    closely with them.


APPRAISAL SUMMARY
      In 2011, the Bureau of Internal Revenue (BIR) has adopted a sound medium-term
strategic plan for reform and a set of agency-level key performance indicators
conforming to good international practice and covering all phases of the tax compliance
cycle as well as overall compliance rates. Because of this as well as an improvement in
project and overall reform management and disbursements record, the NPSTAR team
upgraded the project rating.

      Progress toward the achievement of the project’s development objective is now
moderately satisfactory and progress in project implementation satisfactory. However,
most of the progress so far is in reform planning and monitoring systems and in the
purchase of ICT packages. On the other hand, changes in BIR human resource
management and business processes including internal controls and internal audit have
yet to take place.

      It is still too early to tell whether the implementation of (politically and
administratively) difficult reforms in regulations, business processes and human
resources needed to ensure improved governance and enhanced tax compliance will take
place. Similarly, without changes in tax policy, especially in tax incentives, it will be
difficult to significantly enhance compliance.

      As mentioned above, the proposed activities for the project extension period are
fully in line with BIR’s strategic objectives as well as the project objectives. The ICT
packages and other activities included in the loan, however, are only likely to result in
substantial progress toward the achievement of project objectives if accompanying
management, regulatory changes and business process re-engineering take place.

       Therefore, as discussed above, the three conditions for closing date extension are
fulfilled: (a) project objective continues to be achievable; (b) the performance of the
borrower and implementing agency is satisfactory; and (c) the borrower has prepared a
specific action plan acceptable to the Bank to complete the project (see section C).

      The procurement performance of the project is Satisfactory and the 2010 Annual
Procurement Performance Indicators have been submitted and accepted by the Bank. The
financial management performance of the project is Moderately Satisfactory and the
Bank has received the 2010 Audited Financial Management Report for the project as well
as the unaudited Financial Management Report for January through September 2011.
