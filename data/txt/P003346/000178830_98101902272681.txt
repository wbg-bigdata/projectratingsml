REPORT AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT
OF THE INTERNATIONAL DEVELOPMENT ASSOCIATION
TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS
ON A PROPOSED CREDIT TO THE
SOCIALIST REPUBLIC OF THE UNION OF BURMA
FOR A SECOND PORTS PROJECT
1.        I submit the following report and recommendation on a proposed
development credit to the Union of Burma for the equivalent of US$10 million
on standard IDA terms to help finance a project for deepening the Rangoon Port
Sea Access Channel, the improvement of cargo handling equipment for the
Rangoon Port, procurement of spare parts for existing equipment and vessels,
and materials for replacement of pontoons. The proceeds of the credit would
be relent to the Burma Ports Corporation (BPC) at an interest rate of 9.0% per
annum, repayable over 15 years including 3 years of grace.
PART I - THE ECONOMY
2.        The latest economic report entitled "Development in Burma:    Issues
and Prospects" (1024-BA) was distributed to the Executive Directors on July 27,
1976. Country data are provided in Annex 1.
3.        Burma, the largest country on the Southeast Asian mainland, is rich
in natural resources, much of which have yet to be developed. At present,
the population is about 30 million and the per capita income is US$110.
World War II and the struggle for independence in 1948 economically devastated
the economy and divided Burma politically. The fifties were a period of tur-
bulence, both political and economic. When the present Government came to
power in 1962, its major objectives were to unify the country and complete the
social transformation of the economy which had begun in the forties.
4.        After 11 years of government by the Revolutionary Council, a Consti-
tution was adopted in a nationwide referendum in December 1973. The People's
Assembly is vested with supreme executive, legislative, and judicial authority.
The People's Councils, which extend down to village tracts, are the primary
means of governing the nation. During the recess of the People's Assembly,
the Council of State, which consists of the President and high ranking Govern-
ment officials, exercises power on its behalf. On the whole, there has been
little change in government personnel. The Burma Socialist Program Party is
the only authorized political party.
5.        By and large, the Government has made notable progress in the attain-
ment of its social and political objectives. Insurgency is still a problem,
particularly in the hills and border areas; but there is probably greater
stability now than at any time since independence. Nationalization of all
major sectors has been accomplished. Although the ownership of land is

-2-
vested in the State, the agricultural sector is almost fully operated by
individual farmers. Efforts have also been made to reduce inequalities in the
distribution of income and widen the scope of education and health services.
6.        However, efforts in social fields have been constrained recently by
inadequate financing as a result of slow economic growth. During 1965-75,
real GDP grew at an average annual rate of 2.3%, i.e., hardly above population
growth which was 2.2% annually. Output of productive sectors increased even
more slowly. Stagnation of agricultural production, combined with the growth
of population, led to a steady dwindling of the export surplus. Specifically,
rice, the dominant crop, displayed zero growth between 1963 and 1975 which in
turn resulted in a steady decline in rice exports from 1.6 million tons in
1963 to less than 0.2 million tons in 1975, an average annual decline of 19%.
Although the export price index improved considerably after 1972 and now
stands at over twice the level of 1965, export earnings in 1975 were less
than half those of 1965. The stagnation of agricultural output directly
affected the industrial sector which is largely agro-based. Similarly, due
to the decline in exports, this sector was deprived of much of its basic
import requirements. Over the last decade, industrial production increased
by only 1.4% per year.
7.        Slow economic growth has been largely due in part to the neglect of
agriculture, forestry, mining, and transport. Agriculture, which accounts for
36% of GDP, received on average only 7% of public investment during the last
five years, equivalent to 2% of its value added. Inadequate public invest
ments in agriculture were not offset by private investments. As a means of
ensuring the desired pattern of income distribution, prices for compulsory
delivery to the Government of many agricultural commodities were set at a low
level. Farmers, especially paddy farmers, were left with little incentive to
produce marketable surpluses and with inadequate savings for maintenance and
investments.
8.        Traditionally, the Government budget derived a large part of its
revenues from its rice exports. The diminishing rice export surplus had an
adverse impact on Government income. The related scarcity of foreign exchange
necessitated a marked contraction of imports (reducing customs revenues) and
led to a very slow growth of industrial production (and related revenues).
There was also a substantial loss of Government revenue because the national-
ization of large scale private firms led to reduction in private income taxes.
This was not compensated by an increase in Government revenue from taxes and
surpluses transferred by Government enterprises.
9.        The current revenue/GDP ratio declined from 16.5% in 1963 to 14% in
1973 and below 10% in 1975. The index of current revenue (in real terms) fell
from 100 in 1970 to 68 in 1975. Despite substantial cuts in maintenance and
capital expenditures (in real terms), the budget deficit, almost entirely
financed through bank borrowing, increased so much that the money supply
doubled between 1972 and 1975. The deterioration of the budget was primarily
responsible for the sharp inflation which ran at a yearly rate of over 30%
in 1975.



- 3 -
10.       The Government, in recognition of these problems, has implemented
a series of reforms beginning late 1973: (i) procurement prices of major
agricultural commodities have over the last few years been increased sub-
stantially; (ii) management and organizational reforms of the State economic
enterprises have been introduced, including specific guidelines directing
these enterprises to operate along more commercial lines; (iii) there has
been a shift in the investment strategy which now accords priority to agri-
culture, livestock, forestry, transport, fishery, and mining in contrast to
the past emphasis on industry; (iv) finally, in April 1976, a major tax reform
was enacted, which substituted a new Commodity and Service Tax, with substan-
tially higher rates, for most of the indirect taxes. The tax reform is ex-
pected to increase Government revenues by 40% in 1976/77. An important by-
product of the new tax measures has been a comprehensive recalculation of costs
of production which should manifest itself in terms of realistic prices and
improved financial performance of the State economic enterprises. If success-
ful, these efforts to mobilize more resources for development, reduce infla-
tion, and improve economic management should clear the way for more rapid
growth of investment and production.
11.       The economic situation in 1975/76 showed a marked improvement over
the performance in the previous decade. Though the recent reforms may have
played a part, this was primarily due to favorable weather conditions and the
resulting excellent harvest. Real GDP growth was 6%, the highest since 1968.
Furthermore, investment in 1975/76 increased by about 20 to 25% in real terms;
and this was achieved with a 40% reduction in the budget deficit. As a
consequence, of the improved fiscal situation inflation has now been reduced
to an annual rate of about 20%.
12.       Despite these favorable developments, problems still remain.     It
will be some time before the recent reforms are fully implemented and begin
to have a significant impact. If pursued vigorously and supplemented with
further measures aimed essentially at raising the level of domestic savings
and diversifying and increasing exports, the Government's new policy orien-
tation could lead to a significant acceleration of economic growth. In this
context, substantial foreign transfers of resources into Burma would be help-
ful in complementing domestic efforts. Given Burma's low income level and
the scarcity of foreign exchange, these transfers should be on concessionary
terms and should, in addition, help finance part of local cost requirements
which cannot, at present, be covered adequately by domestic savings alone;
local cost financing is particularly needed for the development of the agri-
cultural sector where most investments have a relatively low foreign exchange
component.
13.       During the last five years, aid commitments averaged US$60 million
a year, mostly on concessional terms. Total external debt as of March 1975
was US$537 million, including an undisbursed balance of about US$217 million.
The debt service ratio has increased recently to about 20%, partially as a
result of the poor performance of exports, but is expected to remain below
20% in the next five years. Burma's gross foreign exchange reserves were
estimated at US$134 million in July 1976, equivalent to about six months'
imports, based on the provisional 1975/76 import levels.



- 4 -
14.       Burma's development potential is considerable.    The Burmese popula-
tion is well educated. Production potential in agriculture is excellent,
especially for paddy. Exploitation of forest wealth is under way and could
be expanded further. Mineral resources are not yet identified sufficiently,
but they are likely to be substantial. The Bank Group, in close cooperation
with the IMF, is pursuing discussions with the Government regarding further
improvement in economic policies which would help develop Burma's promising
potential for economic development. At the Government's request, the Bank has
organized a Burma Aid Group to assist the Government in meeting its development
objectives. The first meeting of this Group was held on November 30, in Tokyo.
PART II - BANK GROUP OPERATIONS-/
15.       Burma became a member of the Bank in 1952, of IFC in 1956, and of
IDA in 1962. Between 1956 and 1961, the Bank made three loans totalling
US$33.1 million, all for transportation projects. A loan for the Port of
Rangoon helped finance the reconstruction of cargo berths and storage
facilities, and the purchase of cargo handling and port equipment. Two loans
helped finance the postwar reconstruction and dieselization of the railways.
All three projects were satisfactorily completed and the loans fully disbursed
by FY68. No lending was requested between 1962 and 1973. Since 1973, IDA has
made seven credits totalling US$132.5 million. IFC has made no investments in
Burma, nor are any planned. Annex II contains a summary statement of Bank
loans and IDA credits as of October 31, 1976, and notes on the execution of
on-going projects; implementation of these projects is proceeding without
major difficulties. In addition, the Bank is Executing Agency for a UNDP-
financed multi-sectoral preinvestment and technical assistance project aimed
at the development of a pipeline of priority project suitable for external
assistance.
16.       The Bank Group strategy is aimed at easing the most immediate
constraints to growth and particularly at increasing and diversifying
production for export in order to alleviate the shortage of foreign exchange.
To achieve this, the Bank Group is placing primary emphasis on the develop-
ment of agriculture, forestry, and mining. The Bank Group is also financing
infrastructure improvements such as transportation and telecommunications,
mainly to rehabilitate facilities whose inadequacy has been increasingly
impeding economic development. The proposed credit, the second Bank Group
lending for the Port of Rangoon, would be the sixth Bank Group lending opera-
tion in the transport sector.
17.       A mining project was appraised in March 1976.    This project would
comprise rehabilitation and expansion of small-scale tin mining.      A fourth
railways project is scheduled for appraisal in January 1977. Other projects
under active preparation include an irrigation project in Upper Burma, a
cereal seeds project, a forestry project, and a fertilizer project.
1/   This section is substantially the same as the corresponding section
of the President's Report on a proposed Credit for a Paddyland
Development Project, dated June 3, 1976 (P-1861-BA).



18.       The Bank Group presently accounts for about 15% of Burma's total
external debt outstanding and about 5% of debt service. In five years, the
Bank Group's share in the total external debt is projected to rise to about
20% and its share in the debt service to fall to about 2-3%.
PART III - THE TRANSPORT SECTOR
19.       Burma has always depended on its rivers to provide a natural means
of transportation. Historically, coastal and inland water transport have been
the most important elements of the transport sector. With the development of
international trade and shipping, the Port of Rangoon was established as a
Port Authority in 1879. Simultaneously and complementary to the inland water
system, the railway construction was started, resulting in the creation of a
second major transport system, linking other important centres with Rangoon.
Later, other smaller coastal ports were developed (see map IBRD-10044R1); and
roads were constructed to complement the existing system. Burma is served by
about 2,000 miles of railway and about 17,000 miles of roads.
20.       The reconstruction and rehabilitation of the transport infrastructure,
which was seriously damaged during World War II, was assisted by Japanese War
Reparations and also by the Bank Group (para. 15). However, little has been
added to the transport infrastructure since World War II. The present poor
condition of the transport infrastructure, transport fleet and other facili-
ties, is reflected in a low level of efficiency in the various transport
entities. The problem is the result of inadequate repair and maintenance
facilities, lack of spare parts, and insufficient procurement of replacements.
This applies, in particular, to the Rangoon Port, which could become a
serious bottleneck to economic recovery unless the proposed replacement
and rehabilitation works are undertaken to avoid a further deterioration in
the cargo handling equipment and Port facilities. A necessary corollary
of this program of rehabilitation is the deepening of the Rangoon Sea Access
Channel to permit use of the Port by larger vessels resulting in greater
efficiency and lower costs. In other modes of transport, problems are being
alleviated through the two on-going IDA supported projects for inland
waterways and railways. While the earlier Bank projects in the transportation
sector were completed satisfactorily, the most recent projects for the inland
waterways and railways have both been subject to some delay resulting from
slow procurement procedures; these problems have now been overcome. The Bank
is also acting as the Executing Agency for a UNDP-financed study of the road
sub-sector, which may result in a project or projects suitable for interna-
tional financing. Together with the proposed Second Ports Project, the Bank
will have provided assistance within all major modes of transport in Burma.
These will, however, help to remedy only the most immediate deficiencies;
further development work will be needed over the longer term within all of
these modes.
21.       The transport sector, excluding highway planning and construction,
is under the authority of the Ministry of Transport and Communication (MOTC).
Highway planning and construction is under the Ministry of Construction (MOC).



-6 -
The MOTC is responsible for enforcing Government policies. Following indepen-
dence and particularly since 1962, the Government policy has been to progres-
sively nationalize the transport sector and to increase its control over the
sector, principally by abolishing the financial autonomy of transport agencies
and by regulating the movement of government-controlled goods (e.g. rice,
oil, coal, cement, fertilizer).
22.       Transport planning and coordination is undertaken within the con-
text of the overall national planning system. Planning is essentially target
oriented as established by the Party Congress for a 20-year plan. Within the
terms of reference given in the 20-year plan, the Party outlines objectives
and targets for a four-year plan. The administration does not appear to play
an active role in plan formulation. The separation of responsibility between
plan formulation and implementation results in unrealistic targets for the
plan. However, some improvements have been introduced both at the central
Government and agency level. A new division was established within the Minis-
try of Planning and Finance (MOPF) in early 1976 for progress reporting and
project evaluation.
23.       The allocation of government-controlled freight traffic is made
through the Central Movement Coordination Committee (CMCC) within MOPF by
utilizing the available public sector capacity and satisfying remaining de-
mand through private operators, who are also free to carry other commodities,
mainly foodstuffs for local consumption. The state-owned transport organ-
izations catered for about 11% of the total transport volume in 1974/75
(compared with about 13% in 1961/62), while private operators handled the
remaining 89%. Spare parts for private operators are made available through
the Ministry of Trade (MOT) but allocations have been insufficient to provide
for proper maintenance of private sector vehicles and craft, which are general-
ly old and in poor condition. However, the role of the private sector will
remain important in the foreseeable future, as the public sector is likely to
be short of capacity and the private sector continues to carry a substantial
part of the traffic.
The Burma Ports Corporation (BPC)
24.       BPC has a high level of autonomy in conducting its affairs, but its
annual budgets on revenue and on capital accounts must be approved by the
Government. However, the Government is in the process of reintroducing great-
er autonomy to all State economic enterprises and requiring them to operate
on a commercial basis. The operational details of these commercial guide-
lines are currently being worked out. The management and senior officials
of the BPC are competent and well qualified, the level of general efficiency
is higher than other State enterprises in Burma. BPC currently employs 8,831
regular staff including 139 officers. BPC has the freedom to increase staff
within the sanctioned establishment (11,038), but BPC's present labor force
is already about 40% greater than that required for current traffic volume.
The GOB and BPC's management are aware of the overstaffing problems and BPC
has informed the Association that it intends to restrict the hiring of new
staff and estimates that the labor force will be reduced by about 3% per annum
as a result of natural wastage. On this basis BPC estimates that their excess



- 7 -
labor force in 1982 would be reduced to not more than about 15% of the
strength needed to deal with the ancipated traffic volume.
25.       BPC is keen to further improve its planning capabilities by
strengthening the planning unit attached to the office of the Managing
Director (the Chief Executive Officer). Provision has been made in the
proposed credit for training of suitable planning personnel.
PART IV - THE PROJECT
26.       The project was identified by the Association and prepared by a
UNDP-financed study in 1974-75, for which the Bank acted as Executing Agency;
and it was appraised in June 1976. A report entitled "Burma: Appraisal of
a Second Ports Project" (No. 1276-BA) dated December 8, 1976 is being circu-
lated separately to the Executive Directors. A credit and project summary
is attached in Annex III. At negotiations held in Washington in November
1976, the Government was represented by a delegation led by U Myo Myint,
Deputy Minister, Ministry of Planning and Finance.
Project Description
27.       The project, the sixth Bank Group lending operation to the transport
sector and the second 1/ involving the Port of Rangoon, is designed to prevent
the Port of Rangoon from becoming a serious bottleneck for the economy. It
comprises most of BPC's planned investment program for the fiscal years
1976-1982, including the expenditure of US$10.0 million equivalent in foreign
exchange out of an estimated foreign exchange requirement of US$11.0 million
equivalent for those years. The project would involve long overdue replace-
ments and rehabilitation works, stabilizing and deepening of the access
channel between the sea and the Port of Rangoon, and improvements in cargo
handling equipment, procurement of spare parts for existing equipment and
vessels, and materials for replacement of pontoons. No expansion of Port
infrastructure is envisaged; the existing berthing facilities would accommo-
date the forecast increase in exports and imports with the proposed improve-
ments in cargo handling facilities.
28.       The project components are:
A.   The rehabilitation/repair of and provision of spare parts for:
(a) A suction dredger which will be utilized for deepening
and maintaining the Rangoon Access Channel to 15 ft.
below datum.
(b) A bucket dredger for maintaining the required dredged
depths at the Port berths and in the Port as necessary.
1/   The first loan for BPC in 1956 (para 15) was completed satisfactorily
and experienced no major problems.



- 8 -
(c) Pilot vessel, survey vessel, buoy tender, and grab
dredgers for Port services.
(d) Cargo handling equipment (including forklift trucks,
mobile cranes, tractors, and trailers).
B.   The purchase of:
(a) New cargo handling equipment (including mobile cranes,
forklift trucks, tractors, trailers, and low loaders)
to replace worn out and unrepairable equipment.
(b) Position-finding equipment and navigational aids for
precision dredging of channels and the accurate mark-
ing of such channels.
(c) Steel, mooring chains and plant, machinery and
ancillary equipment for replacement and/or repair of
steel pontoons, sponsons, and bridges at riverside
berths.
(d) Workshop machinery and tools to improve facilities for
repair and maintenance of cargo handling equipment and
vessels.
C.   The provision of services for:
(a) Preparation of documentation for dredger rehabilita-
tion/repairs and supervision.
(b) Training of dredger crews.
(c) Training of (i) planning personnel and (ii) workshop
technicians in the use of new machinery and in new
maintenance procedures.
D.   The dredging of the Rangoon Sea Access Channel to a depth
of 15 feet below datum and its maintenance at that depth.
Project Execution and Implementation
29.       The BPC will be responsible for the execution of the project.    To
further improve the organizational structure of the dredging operation, BPC
intends to appoint a Dredging Manager in January 1977, after consultation
with the Association; the Manager will direct all dredging activities and
dredger maintenance. In addition, BPC has agreed to appoint a dredging ex-
pert or experts to advise on the rehabilitation of dredgers, to train dredger
crews and to assist in improving the working efficiency of the rehabilitated
dredgers (Section 3.02 of the Development Credit Agreement). Specialists will
also be employed to provide training for personnel engaged in the maintenance
of equipment (Section 4.06 of the Development Credit Agreement). The project
will be implemented over a period of three and one half years.



-9-
Project Cost, and Financing
30.       The estimated cost of the project is US$16.1 million equivalent,
with a foreign exchange component of US$10.0 million equivalent. The local
cost component of US$6.1 million equivalent includes about US$2:9 million
equivalent for import duties and taxes. The proposed IDA credit of US$10.0
million equivalent would finance the entire foreign exchange component or
about 76% of total costs net of import duties and taxes. The total proceeds
of the credit would be relent to the BPC at an interest rate of 9.0% per
annum, repayable over fifteen years including three years of grace (Section
3.01(b) of the Development Credit Agreement). The local cost of the project
would be financed from BPC's internal cash generation. It has been agreed
that the BPC will not incur new debts up to 1981/82 unless debt service
payments are covered 1.5 times by internal cash generation (Section 4.05(a) of
the Development Credit Agreement). In addition, the BPC's investment program
up to 1981/82 shall not be changed without the Association's pr[or consent
(Section 4.03 of the Development Credit Agreement).
Financial Position of BPC
31.       The financial position of the BPC is sound, although maintenance
of satisfactory financial results is to a large extent attributable to sub-
stantial demurrage revenue. The proposed investment will, of course, result
in higher charges for depreciation and loan interest, which will necessitate
some tariff increases to ensure adequate earnings. During negotiations, it
was agreed that tariffs will be adjusted to ensure that earnings from Port
operations starting 1977/78 should be not less than 6% of average net fixed
assets in use (Section 4.04(a) of the Development Credit Agreement). This is
adequate to provide the BPC with sufficient funds to meet its debt service
payments and to provide for any future capital needs which may be reasonably
foreseen. The projected decline in demurrage income will be more than offset
by revenue from increased traffic and tariffs.
Procurement and Disbursement
32.       Dredger rehabilitation will be on the basis of international bidding
from prequalified shipyards. All other items to be purchased by BPC and
financed by the Association will be procured through international competitive
bidding in accordance with IDA guidelines, with the exception oE about US$0.75
million for spare parts for existing equipment and for replacement engines
where it is not feasible to fit a replacement unit of a type other than that
already in use.
33.       The proposed credit would be disbursed against 100% of the CIF
value of imported equipment, spare parts and materials, and the foreign
exchange cost of vessel rehabilitation and/or repairs, consultant services
and training.
Benefits and Justification
34.       In past years, Burma was faced with a severe shortage of foreign
exchange which in turn resulted in inadequate allocations for essential



- 10 -
spares and replacements. Thus, the equipment and installations of the Port
of Rangoon have degenerated into an unsatisfactory condition. The proposed
investment is intended to rectify this situation. The primary objective of
the project is to ensure that Port facilities do not seriously constrain the
country's expected growth in exports as well as increased import activities.
Quantifiable project benefits are mainly (i) reduced ship-waiting times
and (ii) reduced shipping costs from the use of larger and more efficient
ships and improved cargo handling equipment.
35.       The economic rate of return of the project investment, based on
conservative assumptions, has been calculated at 37%. Most of the project
benefits will be passed to the Burmese economy since about 90% of Burma's
foreign trade is carried by the State-owned Burma Five-Star Shipping Corpora-
tion (BFSSC) or by vessels chartered by it, and all of the foreign trade-
related activities are in Burmese ownership. Sensitivity analysis indicates
that even with a 20% increase in project costs (which already includes contin-
gencies) coupled with a 20% reduction in benefits, the economic rate of return
would be 25%.
PART V - LEGAL INSTRUMENTS AND AUTHORITY

C.   Projects in Execution 1/
Cr. No. 413     Inland Water Transport Project; US$16.3 Million Credit of
July 2, 1973; Effective Date: September 17, 1973; Closing
Date: June 30, 1977
Procurement was slow in the beginning because the Inland Water
Transport Corporation's management was not familiar with IDA procedures.
However, procurement has picked up in recent months and at October 31, 1976
US$7.1 millions equivalent had been disbursed. The implementation of the
project has been affected by high tender prices for certain equipment, and as
a result the scope of the project has been reduced and certain equipment will
now be procured locally.
Cr. No. 414     Third Railways Project; US$16.7 Million Credit of July 2,
1973; Effective Date: September 17, 1973; Closing Date:
December 31, 1976
The physical execution of the project has made good progress since
the arrival of material and equipment procured under the credit. A large
maintenance backlog of motive power and rolling stock continues to be the
major constraint on BRC's carrying capacity. As of August 1976, US$15.7
million equivalent is committed which completed the procurement under the
project. The remainder, about US$1.0 million equivalent, is to cover trans-
portation and insurance costs of items procured. At October 31, 1976 US$3.5
million equivalent had been disbursed The volume of traffic which had declined
drastically in the past three years has begun to show signs of recovery;
and in 1975/76, the net tons carried increased by 4% over the previous year.
Passenger traffic continues its increasing trend in long-distance travel.
The passenger miles increased in 1975/76 by 9% over the years 1974/75. In
spite of increases in traffic, tariffs, and railway's control of labor and
material costs, BRC's 1975/76 financial performance was poor, with an operat-
ing ratio of 99.2% and a net deficit of kyats 15.1 million. This was primarily
due to a 98% increase in fuel cost which, in turn, was due to huge increases
in prices of imported coal and furnace oil used for steam traction. The
revised estimates indicate an improvement in the financial performance for
1976/77 due to an increase in traffic and a 13.4% (5.4% effective rate)
increase in passenger fares beginning July 1, 1976.
1/   These notes are designed to inform the Executive Directors regarding the
progress of projects in execution and, in particular, to report any prob-
lems which are being encountered and the action being taken to remedy
them. They should be read in this sense and with the understanding that
they do not purport to present a balanced evaluation of strengths and
weaknesses in project execution.

Cr. No. 483    Lift Irrigation Project; US$17.0 Million Credit of June 21,
1974; Effective Date:   August 6, 1974; Closing Date:   Dec-
ember 31, 1978
The project has made a very good start. Within three months of the
signing of the Credit Agreement, the Project Committee was established and
functioning effectively; procurement actions were initiated for US$12.6 million
equivalent of equipment and spare parts. The contract for procurement of
10,000 pumps was awarded in January 1975. By June 30, 1976, 4,000 pump had
been delivered, and 2,600 pumps had been sold to farmers. The program for
the repair of Irrigation Department construction equipment is under way,
but suffering delays owing to a shortage of key spare parts to be purchased
under the Credit. The program to rehabilitate and extend flood embankments
was set back by the monsoon coming early in April this year. Despite these
problems, it is still possible that the project will be completed on schedule.
At October 31, 1976 a total of US$7.6 millions equivalent had been disbursed,
and US$12.6 millions equivalent had been committed.
Cr. No. 493    Forestry Project; US$24.0 Million Credit of July 10, 1974;
Effective Date: February 27, 1975; Closing Date: March 31,
1981
The date for project effectiveness was postponed three times because
of difficulty in hiring the necessary engineers. However, the four specialists
appointed to assist in project implementation took up their posts in March
1975, bid invitations for most of the equipment were issued in June/July,
and the first awards were made in November of 1975. Orders for the first batch
of extraction equipment on nine ICB tenders valued at about US$5 millions were
placed in February 1976. Some success has now been achieved in reducing the
stocks of girdled teak at forest sites, but problems in recruiting technicians
has delayed the rehabilitation of sawmills and the construction of logging
access roads. A contract has been signed with consultants to make feasibility
studies of future development. At October 31, 1976 US$4.8 millions equivalent
had been disbursed.
Cr. No. 551    Telecommunications Project; US$21.0 Million Credit of May 30,
1975; Effective Date: July 23, 1975; Closing Date: June 30,
1980
The project has had a good start and procurement of equipment items
and coordination with Burmese construction agencies for construction works
under the project are on schedule. Bids for most of the equipment to be
procured under the project have been received and are being evaluated. Cost
over runs of between US$3 millions and US$5 millions seem likely and the pos-
sibility of bilateral assistance is being actively explored by GOB and the
Association. Telecommunications have consistently earned a good return on
assets employed, and new tariffs introduced in April 1976, as well as improve-
ments to the accounting system, are likely to maintain this record.

Cr. No. 597    Livestock Project; US$7.5 Million Credit of December 30,
1975; Effective Date: March 26, 1976; Closing Date:
March 31, 1981
The Livestock Development and Marketing Corporation (LDMC) and the
Project Policy Committee have both been established, and a Project Coordinator
appointed. Under the Credit, two consultants have studied existing training
programs in animal health and livestock technology and their report and recom-
menations for future action have been favorably reviewed by both the Bank and
GOB. Further project work depends upon the appointment of twelve consultants
to provide technical assistance. To date, GOB has not appointed any of these
consultants, and a supervision mission at present in Burma will assist GOB in
this next step.
Cr. No. 642    Paddyland Development Project; US$30.0 Million Credit of
June 21, 1976; Effective Date: August 20, 1976; Closing Date:
June 30, 1983
The Project Implementation Committee and the Project Unit have been
established. Lists of equipment and supplies required for the aerial photo-
graphic survey were reviewed in Burma by Bank consultant, in November 1976.
