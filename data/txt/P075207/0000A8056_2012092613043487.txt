                         The additional financing became effective on December 16, 2008, 18 months afterthe board approval. Main reason for delay in effectiveness was elections in the country that took
                         place after the BoardApproval.During this period, the priorities for rehabilitation on the main and regional road network changed, and the roads proposed earlierwere rehabilitated

                         using the budget of Public Enterprise “Roads of Serbia? (PERS). The length of road to be rehabilitated in theIBRD project has increased from 112.5km to 156.6 km, which required a
                         change in the amount of the IntermediateOutput for thiscomponent in the Results Framework. Good implementation progress of the Project has continued since the last full
                         implementationsupport mission in July – August 2012. Work on eight of nine sections undergoing rehabilitation and all agreed accident black spotimprovements have been completed
                         and work on the remaining road section is progressing well. All consulting services under theproject have been completed successfully.

                         All contracts under IDA have been completed successfully.Unfortunately, due to theheavy fluctuations of the exchange rates, US$ 1.3 million equivalent of IDA funds has been
                         canceled.

                         As of September 5,2012,disbursements amounted to 90 percent (US$104.0 million) of the total loan and credit funds within the project.IDA credit hasclosed on June 30, 2011. Of the
