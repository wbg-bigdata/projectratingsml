I. Disbursement Profile
1. Project Context, Development Objectives and Design

1.1 Context at Appraisal

1.1.1 Regional conflicts in the 1990s led to a significant deterioration in the physical,
social and institutional infrastructure within the country. The transport sector was
particularly affected, and became inadequate to contribute to the recovery of the national
economy or facilitate the reintegration of the country into the regional economy.

1.1.2 At the time of project preparation and appraisal, transport assets in Serbia were in
a poorer condition than in most of its neighboring countries and the initial discussions
with the Government were to have the project cover the transport sector overall.
However, it was later decided to focus on the road sector due to its critical importance
and substantial needs. The Project was initially designed for the State Union of Serbia
and Montenegro. However, the sole client of this the actual Project was only Serbia.

1.1.3. The Republic of Serbia Road Directorate’s (SRD) responsibilities extended over a
network of about 14,000 km of arterial and regional roads, out of a total network of
approximately 40,000 km. About 25 percent of the main and regional roads were in good
condition, 19 percent in fair condition, and 56 percent in bad or very bad condition. The
comparative figures for Croatia were 32 percent, 46 percent, and 22 percent respectively.

1.1.4 According to the PAD, Bank involvement in the Project was justified for the
following reasons: (i) the Bank would be able to provide substantive assistance to the
Government in designing and implementing sustainable policy and institutional reforms,
based on the Bank’s broad experience in the transport sector and the trust resulting from
its long involvement in Yugoslavia prior to the 1990s; and (ii) the Bank was uniquely
placed to help the Government and the sector’s main agencies gather information from
countries experiencing similar challenges, and connect with centers of expertise in the
transport sector worldwide. More generally, the Bank was expected to use its broader
experience, particularly its analytical and advisory assistance, to help the Government
coordinate its transport sector reforms with complementary reforms in other sectors.

1.1.5 The Project supported priorities two and four expressed in the Transitional
Support Strategy (TSS) Update, February 18, 2004 for Serbia and Montenegro: Priority
two was “to stimulate near-term growth and create the basis for a sustainable supply
response?; Priority four was “to improve governance and build effective institutions?.
Those objectives were to be reached through: (i) the rehabilitation of 240 km of highway
and the introduction of competitive tendering of winter and routine maintenance for two
regions; and (ii) the development of the capability of the SRD to plan, budget, and
monitor road expenditures, and to use road maintenance funding more effectively. These
two initiatives were expected to contribute: (i) to a sustainable reduction in vehicle
operating costs and time expenditures; and (ii) to the economic development in the
country and the region. The Project was also conceived to complement ongoing or
planned projects by other international financing agencies (particularly the EIB and the

                                            1
EBRD), which had, traditionally, provided substantial financial support for road transport
infrastructure, but with only limited emphasis on the more challenging issues of public
resource management and efficiency at the sector level.

1.2 Original Project Development Objectives (PDO) and Key Indicators (as approved)

1.2.1 The PDO, as defined in the Project Appraisal Document (PAD), was to improve
the effectiveness of SRD policies for road maintenance and rehabilitation by: (i)
introducing new contracting arrangements with the private sector in two pilot districts;
and (ii) enhancing the sustainability of the use of network analysis in the selection of road
rehabilitation segments. The definition of the PDO was slightly broader in the PAD than
in the Development Credit Agreement 1 . The Implementation Completion and Results
Report (ICR) used the broader PDO definition from the PAD for evaluation of the Project
achievements, not only because this was the standard Bank practice but also because this
definition was more consistent with the scope of the Project.

1.2.2 At appraisal—in 2004—the results framework had a different format than the one
being used currently. The main text of the PAD highlighted only three key performance
indicators, while Annex 1 “Project Design Summary? of the PAD was comprised of 14
indicators of different levels: sector indicators, outcome/impact indicators, output
indicators, and inputs. Annex 2 of the ICR contains a complete list of Project indicators.
The six outcome/impact indicators in Annex 1 were monitored by the Bank’s and
Borrower’s teams during Project implementation and will be used for the evaluation of
the original PDO:

         (a)   Average road roughness at pilots - Macva and Kolubara (m/km);
         (b)   Average road roughness in road segment rehabilitation (m/km);
         (c)   Improved road safety: number of deaths per 10,000 vehicles;
         (d)   Number of competitively awarded and implemented contracts;
         (e)   Perception of road conditions in the Macva and Kolubara regions; and
         (f)   Perception of road safety in the Macva and Kolubara regions.

1.3 Revised PDO (as approved by original approving authority) and Key Indicators, and
Reasons/Justification

1.3.1 The Project had an Additional Financing (AF) Loan in 2007, which also involved
a Level-1 Restructuring. At the time of the AF, the PDO was amended to ensure a better
fit with the scope and nature of the activities in the expanded Project. The Bank Project
team (Team)—which had changed by the time of the AF—amended the PDO to read as
follows: “to assist the Government of Serbia in reducing road user 2 costs and improving
safety for road users through: (a) improving the condition of selected road sections of the
main and regional road network; (b) improving the effectiveness of road maintenance

  The part “enhance the sustainability of the use of network analysis in the selection of road rehabilitation segments?
was truncated to “the introduction of network analysis to selected road rehabilitation segments in the Republic of
Serbia? in the Development Credit Agreement.
2
  “Road user? is missing in the PDO in the Results Framework of the AF.

                                                          2
through the introduction of performance-based contracting in two pilot regions; and (c)
introducing safe road design principles, road safety audits, and targeted improvement
measures.?

1.3.2 The old Results Framework (RF) was replaced with monitoring indicators better
reflecting the changes in the Project activities and its scope. It was implicitly understood
that the old RF indicators were dropped. The main text of the Project Paper (PP) of the
AF outlined the following key performance indicators to monitor progress towards the
revised PDO:

           (i) Reduction in road user costs on the rehabilitated road sections;
           (ii) Reduction in unit costs for routine and winter maintenance activities in the
           two pilot regions;
           (iii) Improved capacity in the Public Enterprise “Roads of Serbia? (PERS) 3 to
           manage road maintenance and rehabilitation programs, reflected by the
           establishment of the Road and Bridge Database; and
           (iv) Improved road safety, reflected by the length of road subjected to road safety
           audits, and the number of addressed ‘black spots’.

1.3.3 The RF Annex of the PP included the first, second, and fourth Project indicators
above, which are used for the assessment of the revised PDO achievement in this ICR.
The third indicator was omitted in the PDO, but included and incorrectly listed as “Road
Accident Database established and operational? in the list of intermediate outcome
indicators in the RF of the PP. Overall, the RF was comprised of three Project outcome
indicators and six intermediate outcome indicators. Annex 2 of the ICR provides further
details on inconsistencies in the definitions of the indicators in the main text of the PP
and the RF Annex of the PP.

1.3.4 The substitution of the priority road sections for rehabilitation during the level-
two restructuring in March 2010 increased the length of road to be rehabilitated from 113
km to 157 km—which changed the amount of the Intermediate Output for Component 1
in the RF.

1.4 Main Beneficiaries

1.4.1 The parent Project PAD highlighted several target groups including: (i) transport
operators—through reduction in transport costs on the road network; (ii) producers and
consumers of goods transported by road—through partial transport cost reductions; and
(iii) transport users—through access to a wider and less expensive range of transport
services. The Project was also bringing indirect benefits to the entire population by
reducing the cost of goods and services in Serbia, making a positive contribution to
economic growth and poverty reduction.

    By the time of the AF, the SRD had undergone an institutional reform and become a public enterprise.

                                                      3
1.4.2 The SRD was another beneficiary of the Project—through strengthening of its
institutional capacity (Component 1). The Project was expected to assist the SRD in
bringing the main sector issues to the forefront of its agenda and in developing solutions
to these issues. The Project also had an overall ambition of helping the SRD to improve
harmonization of standards and specifications with the EU for roads and road transports.

1.4.3 The AF was expected to continue benefiting the same target groups as the parent
Project, by improving road conditions through: (i) performance-based maintenance; (ii)
rehabilitation of seven sections of the primary road network; and (iii) road safety
improvement activities. The AF was also expected to benefit the PERS 4 through
improved resource usage in road maintenance, improved design processes in the PERS,
and continued use of road network analysis for selecting and prioritizing investments.

1.5 Original Components (as approved)

1.5.1 The Project was approved by the Board on May 25, 2004. The Project consisted
of two components:

A. Strengthening of the SRD Institutional Capacity (Estimated Costs – US$7.85
million; IDA Estimated Share – US$6.41 million). This component included technical
assistance, training, services, and provision of goods. The objectives of Component 1
were to: (i) strengthen the SRD's Information Center, including the improvement of its
computerized road and bridge databases for the road networks, and the establishment of a
computerized system for contract management; (ii) strengthen systems and procedures
for planning and budgeting road expenditures based on economic appraisal
methodologies; (iii) improve the procurement and supervision of road works; (iv) provide
consultancy services for supervision of road maintenance and rehabilitation works; and
(v) provide equipment, materials, and supplies for improved road management capability
in the SRD.

The first component was expected to be complemented by a separate activity, involving
an arrangement between the SRD and the Swedish National Road Administration
(SNRA) funded by the Swedish International Development Agency (SIDA). The SIDA
funding was to be a parallel financing for the Project. The SIDA grant—equivalent to
US$1.5 million—was aimed at strengthening the SRD's ability to manage routine and
winter maintenance, define and implement a strategy to improve road safety, and
manage the environmental impacts of road projects.

B. Enhancement of Road Maintenance, Rehabilitation, and Safety (Estimated Costs –
US$53.4 million; IDA Estimated Share – US$48.59 million). This component supported
priority rehabilitation needs on: (i) seven main road network sections; and (ii) main and
regional road maintenance by contract, on a pilot basis, in the regions of Macva and
Kolubara. These two contracts were expected to introduce the applicability to Serbia of

 By the time of the AF, the SRD had undergone and institutional reform and had been transformed into
Public Enterprise “Roads of Serbia’? (PERS).

contractually-based, competitively tendered routine maintenance, as now implemented in
a number of West European countries. They also include measures to improve traffic
safety. The experience gained through these contracts would help develop a model that
could be replicated throughout the country.

1.6 Revised Components

1.6.1 The scaling up of the TRP under the 2007 AF increased the Project components
from two to four in line with the revised PDO:

(a) Component 1. Performance-Based Road Maintenance. Estimated costs – EUR10.7
million (US$14.60 million equivalent), of which EUR 9.65 million (US$13.14 million
equivalent) was from IBRD Loan, and EUR 1.07 million (US$1.46 million equivalent)
was from Borrower financing. This component was to support the PBC in the pilot
regions, Macva and Kolubara, for 3 additional years, covering 660 km and 517 km of
main and regional roads. The contracts that were under execution at that time were
amended to include more routine maintenance activities on an output, rather than input
basis.

(b) Component 2. Road Rehabilitation. Estimated costs – EUR 26.6 million (US$36.2
million equivalent), of which EUR 23.93 million (US$32.58 million equivalent) was
from IBRD Loan, and EUR 2.65 million (US$3.62 million equivalent) was from
Borrower financing. This component financed the rehabilitation of 7 additional sections
of the primary road network selected by using network analysis, with a total length of 113
km.

(c) Component 3. Assorted Consultant Services. Estimated costs – EUR 2.21 million
(US$3.01 million equivalent), of which EUR 1.81 million (US$2.47 million equivalent)
was from IBRD Loan, and EUR 0.39 million (US$0.54 million equivalent) was from
Borrower financing. This component financed consulting services for supervision of
maintenance and rehabilitation works and environmental monitoring.

(d) Component 4. Road Safety Improvement. Estimated total costs – EUR 1.54 million
(US$2.1 million equivalent), of which EUR 1.33 million (US$1.82 million equivalent)
was from IBRD Loan, and EUR 0.20 million (US$0.28 million equivalent) was from
Borrower financing. This component supported road safety activities, including
elimination of dangerous spots on the main road network and road safety audits of the
rehabilitated sections and in the pilot districts.

1.6.2 Because the AF was a Level-One restructuring, all changes to the Project were
approved by the Board.

1.7 Other Significant Changes

1.7.1 During its seven-and-half-year life, the Project underwent a total of five
restructurings. The summary of restructurings, major changes and reasons for those
changes are presented in the table below.

1.7.2 Schedule. The Project closing dates were extended four times, which brought the
total extension period to three years and nine months, and the total implementation period
to seven and a half years. More details on the extensions are given in Table 1.7.1.

1.7.3 Funding Allocations. The amount of the Project increased from US$55 million to
US$105 million after the approval of the AF (IBRD loan) in the amount of US$50
million on June 20, 2007. Those US$50 million were re-allocated between the four
components that were devised under the AF (see Section 1.6), while the original US$55
million was expected to be fully spent on the original two components of the parent
Project.

1.7.4 The June 2011 restructuring involved reallocation of some funds from consulting
services to works under both IDA credit and IBRD loan, and retrospective change in the
financing parameters. The latter was requested by the Government and agreed to on an
exceptional basis as a response to the impact of the economic crisis. More details are
given in Annex 2.

1.7.5 Implementation Arrangements. The implementation arrangements remained the
same throughout all restructurings. However, the SRD—the implementing agency (IA)—
was transformed into a Public Enterprise “Roads of Serbia? (PERS), as a result of the
institutional reform in 2006.

2. Key Factors Affecting Implementation and Outcomes

2.1 Project Preparation, Design and Quality at Entry

2.1.1 Soundness of the Background Analysis. The TRP was the first credit for a
transport project in Serbia in over a decade, and Project preparation was lengthy
stretching from 2002 to 2004. The final Project design drew upon eight major lessons
from transport projects in Central and Eastern Europe and the Former Soviet Union.
These were: (i) limiting the complexity of the Project’s design; (ii) focusing on
Borrower real priorities issues; (iii) having a committed, trained, and stable counterpart
team in the Government; (iv) involving local consultants and technical institutes with
users in Project design and implementation; (v) disseminating worldwide experience in
the transport sector; (vi) carrying pilot activities whenever possible to do so; (vii) giving
detailed attention early on to procurement and other Project implementation issues; and
(viii) maintaining flexibility to facilitate Project implementation. The Quality Assurance
Group (QAG) noted an adequate knowledge of the sector—coming from the work carried
out by other agencies and international financial institutions (IFIs)—but this was not well
documented in the PAD. (See paragraphs 1.1.4 and 1.1.5 for the rationale of the Bank’s
intervention.)

2.1.2 Assessment of the Project Design. The final Project design was simple in terms of
components, geographic coverage, novelty, involved organizations, and safeguard policies
triggered. During preparation, the Project focused on the transport sector as a whole.
However, during the February 2004 negotiations, the Project design was significantly

                                             7
simplified to address the road sub-sector—which was of the highest priority to the
Borrower. There were only two components: (i) institutional capacity strengthening; and
(ii) implementation of physical works (maintenance, rehabilitation and road safety works).
When the Project was re-negotiated in April 2004, its scope and credit size increased
(from USD25 million to USD55 million), but the design was kept the same.

2.1.3 To simplify implementation, the Project was concentrated in three neighboring
regions. At the initiative of Serbia, the Project promoted the piloting of performance-
based maintenance contracting making it the first country among the Bank’s client
countries in Europe and Central Asia to do so. To further the institution building goals,
the SRD’s internal structure was used to implement the Project instead of establishing a
Project Implementation Unit (PIU).

2.1.4 There were no co-financiers involved in the Project. However, the Swedish
National Road Administration (SNRA) and the SRD signed Twinning Arrangements—
complementing the TRP—in the middle of 2004, for a three year period. The Bank was
involved in the quality review and supervision of the SNRA-funded activities, as the
TRP’s Project activities depended on the quality and timing of the activities under the
Twinning Arrangements.

2.1.5 The rehabilitation and maintenance works on existing road alignments triggered
the environmental safeguards policy. The SDR environmental capacity was strengthened
through the Twinning Arrangements.

2.1.6 Adequacy of Government’s Commitment. The substantial commitment of the
Government at the Project entry included (i) a “Road Management and Maintenance
Policy Letter? (prepared by the MOCI and the SRD), demonstrating the Government’s
commitment; (ii) the progress achieved in the contracts for maintenance; and (iii) the
successful award to the lowest evaluated foreign bidder of an ICB contract despite the
protests of a local firm. The interactions between the SRD and the Bank remained at a
very positive level. The SRD carried out the consultations with road users and local
community associations. A Rapid Social Assessment was undertaken that focused on
rural communities and their role regarding rural road connections, bus stop locations, rest
stops, and a proper demarcation of local farmer market sites along the regional roads.
During the design phase these associations provided feedback on the works designs—and
their needs were accommodated as much as feasible.

2.1.7 Assessment of Risks. Eight risks were identified at appraisal of the parent TRP,
three of which were rated substantial and the rest moderate. All risks discussed in the
Risk table of the PAD were properly identified and mitigation measures were adequately
developed. In the end, none of those risks either negatively affected Project
implementation or hindered the achievement of the PDO, because they did not either
materialize or because the proposed mitigation measures were effectively applied. The
Bank Team was candid in highlighting in the PAD the risk to the sustainability of the
institutional and regulatory reforms—which would stem from potential rapid turnover of
staff and related institutional disruptions. As mitigation measures, the Bank would

                                            8
disseminate information on international best practices and the benefits from change,
monitor the change process, and support domestic efforts to define a coherent transport
policy and strategy, encompassing the reform process. The Team also underscored the
sustainability of maintenance funding as a risk. However, it was anticipated that the
improvements in road monitoring and budget formulation would demonstrate the benefits
of adequate maintenance funding, and strengthen the case for the provision of a secure
flow of funds. The overall Project risk in the original TRP was rated as substantial.

2.1.8 Appraisal of the AF identified two main risks. The first was related to the capacity
of the Project Implementation Team (PIT) within the Road Directorate/PERS to manage
a large number of activities and ensure timely procurement and disbursements under the
loan. This risk was mitigated by hiring additional procurement support for the PIT. The
second risk involved potential delays in implementation and disbursements related to the
weaknesses in the engineering design process within PERS. This was addressed by
piloting a new process for all sections planned for rehabilitation under the AF (see
paragraph 2.2.7 for details). The PP of the AF did not, however, update the overall
Project risk rating.

2.1.9 Quality at Entry Assessment. In May 2005, the Quality Assurance Group (QAG)
rated quality at entry as Satisfactory (S). However, the QAG Panel rated the Bank Inputs
and Processes as Moderately Satisfactory (MS), because it believed there was some scope
for improvement with missed opportunity in the Quality Enhancement Review (QER)
and Project documentation for greater clarity. The QAG noted the lack of a sector
financing plan. This posed the risk that—whereas the Project itself might be implemented
as expected—other maintenance and rehabilitation works outside its scope might be
vulnerable to counterpart funding shortages. The ICR Team concurred with the QAG’s
Satisfactory rating for the quality of the Project and MS rating for the Bank’s
performance at entry. More detailed discussion is provided in Section 5.1.

2.2 Implementation

2.2.1 Implementation was rated as S or MS in the Bank’s Implementation Status and
Results (ISR) reports throughout the Project life—except in late 2009, when it was rated
moderately unsatisfactory (MU). A number of factors, most of which beyond the control
of the PERS, resulted in long delays and required restructuring:

2.2.2 Political Economy. In the spring of 2007—before the elections—the Government
and the Bank prioritized the preparation of AFs in several sectors. The TRP was among
four projects that received an IBRD loan through an AF. The AF effectiveness date was
extended twice—the AF became effective 18 months after the Board’s approval. This
delay was caused by three elections and the formation of a new Serbian government.
When the AF became effective, the road sections originally proposed for support under
the AF had been rehabilitated, and the PBCs in the Macva and Kolubara regions were
renewed for an additional three years—in both cases, using the GOS’s own budget.
Another restructuring replaced those road sections and ensured that the GOS—not the
IBRD loan—would continue financing the renewed PBC, and that the Bank would only
provide the PBC implementation supervision (See Table 1.7.1).
                                            9
2.2.3 Economic Crisis in Europe. Because of the economic crisis in Europe, three
contracts had to be terminated due to the insolvency of two contractors working on three
Project road sections—despite their having met all required financial and technical
requirements at the time of the contract awards. The contracts were re-tendered and the
closing date of the Project was extended by five-and-a-half months (from December 31,
2011 to June 15, 2012), to ensure the completion of the remaining works.

2.2.4 Weather Conditions. Extremely harsh weather conditions precluded the
successful completion of the Project as planned on June 15, 2012. The declaration of an
emergency by the Government in February 2012, and heavy, persistent rain during the
spring prevented contractors from performing the works within the agreed time frame. A
three and a half month extension—the fifth and final Project restructuring—was given to
complete the remaining works.

2.2.5 Frequent Change of Top Management and Weak Capacity of the PIT in the
First Years of Project Implementation. The Project experienced slow progress during
the first two years of implementation, because there were three different Project
Coordinators and a continuous shortage of capacity within the PIT of the SRD/PERS.
These problems were addressed by: (i) splitting managerial responsibilities for the TRP,
and Twinning arrangements between two people to more effectively manage both
projects; and (ii) creating a PERS Project Steering Committee to oversee the TRP
implementation and the Twinning Arrangements. To increase capacity, three additional
specialists—an assistant Project manager, a procurement assistant, and an engineer—
were hired to assist the PIT.

2.2.6 Systemic Weaknesses in the Engineering Design Process. In the earlier stages of
implementation, the rehabilitation of several Project road sections faced serious
difficulties. Those deficiencies resulted from systemic weaknesses in the engineering
design process, namely: (i) very poor guidelines in the design Terms of Reference
(TORs); (ii) insufficient surveys of existing road conditions, drainage systems, bridges,
and culverts, (iii) insufficient investigation of the bearing capacity of the soil, and (iv) too
long of a period between the survey and the start of civil works. As a result, the
construction periods had to be extended to accommodate design amendments, and issues
of cost-overruns had to be resolved with the contractors. During a supervision mission in
March 2007, it was agreed to apply a new design process to all sections to be
rehabilitated under the AF on a pilot basis. From that point on, the design TORs were
sent to the Bank for a formal no objection before being issued. For all ongoing road
sections that already had an existing design in place, a systematic safety audit of the
design was undertaken at the Bank’s request and the recommendations were forwarded to
the Bank. The business plan of PERS for 2007 included the hiring of a consultant to
undertake safety audits.

2.2.7 Unavailability of Counterpart Funding for PBC Scaling Up to the Rest of the
Country. The GOS realized substantial cost savings in using PBCs as compared to
traditional unit-based contracts—especially for winter routine maintenance. The GOS
intended to scale this approach up to the rest of the country. Every year the PERS sought
                                              10
a budget from the MOF to implement PBCs nationwide, but the attempt never succeeded.
This is being addressed in the Road Rehabilitation and Safety Project, that is currently
under preparation, by linking the implementation of PBC contracts to payments for the
rehabilitation of road sections under the project.

2.2.8   Two factors that contributed to the strong implementation were:

2.2.9 Sector Reform. On January 1, 2006, the Serbian Road Directorate (SRD) became
a Public Enterprise “Roads of Serbia? (PERS). This reform incentivized the staff to learn
and adopt more modern practices to perform more effectively in managing
implementation of this and other projects.

2.2.10 Continuity and Commitment of the PIT Staff. While many PIT staff enhanced
their capacity and skills through training and study visits financed by the parent Project
and the AF, they did not move to the private sector. The PIT was also proactive in
identifying weaknesses and mistakes, and in correcting them (the engineering design
process-see paragraph 2.2.6- is a case in point.) The PIT saw the Bank Team as a genuine
partner and maintained close collaboration.

2.3 Monitoring and Evaluation (M&E) Design, Implementation and Utilization

2.3.1 In the parent TRP, the outcome/impact indicators identified as PDO indicators
were well defined and encompassed most of the Project activities. However, the PDO
indicators did not capture the PDO well. The Level-1 Restructuring/AF modified the
PDO and Project indicators to better reflect the Project activities—and better linked the
PDO and the indicators. However, one indicator was incorrectly listed in the Results
Framework as “Road Accident Database? instead of “Road Database Established and
Operational?. The Bank Team did not take advantage of any further restructurings to
address this issue.

2.3.2 Prior to November 2009, the ISRs provided no reporting on progress towards
target indicators in the Aide-Memoires (AMs). However, the ISRs did regularly provide
updates on five out of nine indicators. The ISRs began reporting on the following
indicators after the 2007 public opinion survey was completed: (i) “Number of
competitively awarded and implemented contracts?; (ii) “Perception of road conditions in
the Macva and Kolubara regions?; and (iii) “Perception of road safety in the Macva and
Kolumbara regions?. The following indicators were met in the first year of Project
implementation: (i) “Planning and budgeting road expenditure methodology? (through
using a network analysis based on HDM-4); and (ii) “Contracts issued to private
contractors in two pilot regions?. Despite the AF in 2007 and the amended indicators, the
ISRs continued reporting on progress towards the original Project. The ISRs started
reporting on the new set of indicators only in May 2010.

2.3.3 The PIT was responsible for monitoring Project indicators. Except for the length
of roads rehabilitated, none of the other indicators was used in the PERS annual
monitoring activity. In the RRSP, which is currently under preparation, the PIT and the
Bank Team carefully reviewed the Project indicators, in particular those that monitor
                                           11
progress of Project activities. The indicators to be used in the new Project include: (i)
“Reduction in road traffic accidents with fatalities on the improved roads? (from 100
percent to 90 percent as a unit of measurement); and (ii) “PBMC Contracts in
Implementation? (“km length coverage? instead of “experience with approach? as a unit
of measurement).

2.4 Safeguard and Fiduciary Compliance

2.4.1 Environmental Safeguards. The Project was an Environmental Category B
(Partial Assessment) Project, with minor negative impacts on the environment. In
compliance with the World Bank OP/BP 4.01 Environmental Assessment and Serbia’s
national legislation related to environmental protection, the Environmental Management
Plan (EMP) included a mitigation plan, a monitoring plan, institutional strengthening
needs, and a record of public consultations. During Project preparation, consultations on
environmental aspects were carried out. Public hearings were held near the communities
located close to road sections to be rehabilitated under the Project, to ensure that those
most directly affected by the Project could—by voicing their opinions and suggestions—
increase the quality and efficiency of the works design. Mitigation measures specified in
the EMP were incorporated as requirements in the bidding documents for the civil works,
and suggestions from local communities—such as additional accesses or drainages—
were incorporated into designs.

2.4.2 The Level-1 Restructuring did not affect the environmental category of the
Project, because the Project continued to provide support to rehabilitation and
maintenance of the existing roads. The Level-1 Restructuring/AF continued to require the
implementation of the EMP. The mitigation and monitoring plans were similar to the
original ones, and adequate for the AF. Once the level-2 restructuring took place, the
same principles of environmental management were applied and similar EMPs were
developed and adopted for the newly suggested Project road sections.

2.4.3 In 2003, an Environmental Unit—with a civil engineer and a geographer—was
established in the Roads Directorate in accordance with the requirements of the EMP for
the TRP.

2.4.4 In the earlier implementation stages, the Project faced difficulties in
environmental management, due to a lack of the contractors’ experience in applying
environmental protection measures. To address this issue, the SRD clarified requirements
under the relevant contract provisions and provided on-the-job training. As the civil
works contracts under the Project continued increasing, both consultants and contractors
became more knowledgeable in environmental safeguards, and their performance
improved.

2.4.5 Social Safeguards. During the preparation stage, the Bank confirmed that OP/BP
4.12 Involuntary Resettlement was not triggered.

2.4.6 The SRD carried out consultations with road users as well as local community
associations during Project preparation as described in 2.1.6.

                                           12
2.4.7 The Project generated a number of jobs for local persons, and improved access to
houses and agricultural fields, and other services. In some cases, service roads were
constructed at the request of local persons (see more on benefits in Section 3.5). There
were no complaints received from the local persons during the construction period; the
contractors performed the works with due respect to the local community, and did not
cause any major obstacles to life comfort and performance of activities along the roads.

2.4.8 Procurement. The Project was classified as high risk based on the Country
Procurement Assessment Review (CPAR) at Project preparation. Procurement was
mainly carried out through International Competitive Bidding (ICB), which enabled prior
review by the Bank and mitigated potential risks. The QAG noted that the two pilot
performance-based contracts had a rather complex system of penalties, which could open
a door for potential corruption, and would therefore require careful oversight. However,
this risk never materialized.

2.4.9 The management of procurement activities was the responsibility of the PIT,
which was staffed with two full time procurement staff and supplemented by external
experienced consultants (firm or individuals) when needed. The procurement of works,
goods and consulting services was carried out in accordance with the World Bank
Procurement Guidelines. Procurement of all works contracts, including PBCs, was done
using ICB.

2.4.10 Limited Competitive Bidding (LCB) and Direct Contracting (DC) were used only
when the contracts of two contractors needed to be terminated due to financial insolvency.
The PERS provided adequate justifications to the Bank, and the Bank concurred. LCB
was used in order not to lose the remaining period of construction season, and complete
the unfinished works. Before the beginning of winter—due to safety considerations and
urgency of works—the PERS requested permission, on an exceptional basis, to use DC to
procure a contractor active in the vicinity of the construction for the completion of
emergency works. The Bank provided its no objection. As of the closing date of the
Project, there were no unresolved procurement issues.

2.4.11 Financial Management. There were no major issues in financial management
(FM). The PIT was adequately staffed for carrying out the FM functions. FM was
handled by a qualified finance officer and a finance assistant. The interim financial
reports submitted to and reviewed by the Bank during implementation were found to be
satisfactory, in a format acceptable to the Bank, and with minor or no issues identified.
Annual audit reports were received on time, and the auditor’s opinion was unqualified.

2.4.12 The total amount of the IBRD loan (IBRD-74630) and IDA credit (IDA-39090)
was US$105 million (SDR 74.3 million). The IDA-39090 Credit in the amount of
US$55.71 (SDR 36.66 million) was disbursed. Approximately US$1.3 million (SDR 0.83
million) out of US$55 million (SDR 37.5 million) of the IDA Credit was cancelled and
was closed on December 14, 2011. The final total in USD value exceeded the original
value in USD of the IDA Credit, due to the fluctuations in the exchange rate between the

                                           13
US Dollar, Special Drawing Rights and Serbian Dinar from 2004 through 2011. As of
February 17, 2013, US$47.39 million (SDR 35.76 million) was disbursed out of US$50
million (SDR 36.8 million) of the IBRD-74630 Loan. The remaining amount of US$1.42
(SDR 1.04) was cancelled, and the loan was closed on February 20, 2013.

2.5 Post-completion Operation/Next Phase

2.5.1 All newly rehabilitated sections are under routine maintenance contracts and are
implemented by regional contractors. Road sections under pilot PBCs in the Macva and
Kolubara regions are still under PBCs. However, the overall PBC framework including
bidding documents will be modified and improved, and further capacity of the public and
private sectors will be strengthened under the forthcoming WB-funded RRSP. The new
RRSP will finance rehabilitation of about 35-40 road sections, totaling over 800 km in
length, and will support the maintenance of 3000 km of national roads under PBCs.

3. Assessment of Outcomes

3.1 Relevance of Objectives, Design and Implementation

3.1.1. The original PDO was relevant to the CAS for FY05-07—which was effective at
the time of the approval of the AF/Level-1 restructuring—and to the following two
government strategies: (i) Stabilization and Association Process; and (ii) the Poverty
Reduction Strategy Paper (PRSP). It contributed to two CAS pillars: (i) “the creation of a
smaller, more sustainable, more efficient public sector? through improving the
effectiveness of the SRD policies for road maintenance and rehabilitation; and (ii) “the
creation of a larger, more dynamic private sector? through supporting new contracting
arrangements (PBCs). The original design, in terms of Project components and
implementation arrangements, was consistent with the original PDO. Both Project
components sought to contribute to improvement in “the effectiveness of SRD policies
for road maintenance and rehabilitation? through strengthening the institutional capacity
of the SRD in many areas, and enhancing road maintenance, rehabilitation and safety
practices. Implementation arrangements were appropriately chosen to facilitate effective
implementation of the components. At the time of the preparation of the original TRP, the
decision was made to rely on the SRD’s internal structure through creating and using a
core team—the Project Implementation Team. The choice of the lending instrument—a
Specific Investment Loan (SIL)—was appropriate to support rehabilitation, maintenance
and road safety activities. Thus, the original PDO design and implementation remained
relevant and important at the time of the approval of the Level-1 restructuring.

3.1.2 The revised PDO remains relevant to: (i) “Strategy and Development Policy for
Industrialization for the Republic of Serbia?; (ii) “Development Strategy of Railroad,
Road, Air and Intermodal Transport in the Republic of Serbia for the period 2008-2015?;
and (iii) the Bank and IFC’s CPS for Serbia for FY12-FY15. The CPS is closely aligned
with the EC’s Europe 2020 Growth Strategy. As outlined in the CPS, the Bank’s
interventions in Serbia are designed to advance the EU agenda of smart and inclusive
growth. The TRP contributed to promoting competitiveness through improved and safe


                                           14
road connectivity, thus encouraging economic development in regions not directly linked
to the main transport corridors.

3.1.3 The revised design of the Project after the Level-1 restructuring is relevant, as the
Project components are found to be consistent with the revised PDO. The Road
Rehabilitation Component contributed to the achievement of the PDO through improving
the condition of selected road sections. The Performance-based Road Maintenance
Component contributed through extending the scope of performance-based maintenance
contracts in two pilot regions for three additional years. The Road Safety Improvement
Component contributed through supporting implementation of road safety improvement
activities. Implementation arrangements remained the same as under the parent TRP. The
choice of a lending instrument—a SIL—was again appropriate to support investment in
the road sector and implementation of road safety measures.

3.1.4 The revised PDO, design and implementation of the Project remain important and
relevant to the global priorities of improved road safety and prevention of road traffic
deaths—which are reflected in the UN Decade of Action for Road Safety, 2011-2020 and
Serbia’s 2009 Road Safety Law.

3.2 Achievement of Project Development Objectives

3.2.1 The Achievement of the Original PDO was Rated as Moderately Satisfactory. The
rating was based on the evaluation of the achievement of the PDO, its indicators and
outcome targets as of the date of approval of the revised PDOs as part of the Level-1
Restructuring that was also the AF (not the date of the effectiveness of the AF). This
methodology was adopted as per advice of the World Bank OPCS. The effectiveness of
the SRD policies was improved through:

(i) Introduction of new contracting arrangements with the private sector in two pilot
districts. It was fully achieved, and it is demonstrated through:

   (a) Improved maintenance systems in two pilot districts within fixed budget envelopes.
   This was fully achieved. The SRD successfully introduced and implemented two
   three-year hybrid performance-based contracts (PBCs) on 1,200 km of roads in two
   pilot Macva and Kolubara districts. At the time of the AF approval, these two
   contracts were implemented within fixed budget envelopes, with no cost or time
   overruns. Moreover, the SRD found the PBC approach more cost-effective than a
   traditional input-based contracting approach. Significant reductions were noted in
   resource use (e.g., salt consumption per ton/km) and unit costs for winter
   maintenance in the two pilot districts as compared with elsewhere in Serbia in the
   winter seasons during 2005-2007. At that time, the SRD intended to extend those
   contracts for an additional three-year period and scale the PBC approach up to the rest
   of the country.

   (b) Lower costs and improved quality and safety in road segment rehabilitation
   projects following competitive procedures. This was partially achieved. Adequate
   packaging and the ICB option contributed toward increasing competition, but they
                                            15
   were not major factors affecting final costs. Only one contract (the Kragujevac-Ravni
   Gaj road section) was completed within the contract period and budget by the date of
   the approval of the Level-1 restructuring/AF. The rest of the rehabilitation contracts
   that were either under implementation or in the bidding process were thought to have
   time and cost overruns due to systemic weaknesses in the design process (see Section
   2.2). Improved quality in the Project road sections was not claimed, because only one
   contract was completed by that time (in October 2006). Though it was possible to
   assume the condition of this road section (in terms of IRI) improved, no actual road
   condition survey had been carried out to confirm that assumption. Safety in the
   Project road sections seemed to have improved by the approval date of the Level-1
   restructuring/AF, but this achievement could not be fully attributed to the Project. The
   road fatality rate declined from 6 deaths per 10,000 in 2003 to 3.45 deaths per 10,000
   in September 2006. Road safety-related activities planned on the Project road sections
   were not fully completed by the date of the approval of Level-1 restructuring/AF. The
   safety audit of the only completed road section (Kragujevac-Ravni Gaj) carried out in
   early November 2006 revealed a number of serious safety issues. Most of the safety
   audit recommendations were addressed shortly after the AF approval date.

   (c) Increased capability of the SRD to procure road works competitively and
   objectively supervise their implementation. This was fully achieved. The overall
   procurement capacity was enhanced through the assignment of a procurement
   assistant to the PIT in the SRD, and training this assistant on World Bank
   Procurement Guidelines. All rehabilitation works contracts and PBCs were procured
   through open competition. The objective supervision of the works was ensured
   through outsourcing of supervision services of civil works, without directly involving
   the employer/PERS in the supervision.

(ii) Enhancement of the sustainability of the use of network analysis in the selection of
road rehabilitation segments. This was fully achieved. The SRD actively used a network
analysis based on the HDM-4 as a main tool to select road sections for its rehabilitation
projects, whether financed from the budget or external sources. The HDM-4 was also
used to identify and select candidate road sections for the Additional Financing/Level-1
Restructuring of the Project.

3.2.2 The Achievement of the Revised PDO was Rated as Satisfactory. The rating took
into account achievement of the key outcome targets set at appraisal, and the ones
associated with the revised PDOs. Reduction in road user costs and improvement in
safety for road users were achieved through:

   (a) Improving the condition of selected road sections of the main and regional road
   network. This was partially achieved. Improved condition of the Project road sections
   was demonstrated through a substantial reduction in vehicle operating costs (VOC)
   for road users, by car. VOCs were reduced by 8.1 percent (8.3 percent for IDA-
   financed road sections and 7.8 percent for IBRD-financed sections) which was almost
   half the target indicator set at appraisal of the AF/Level-1 Restructuring (15 percent).
   Improved conditions of the Project road sections were achieved through carrying out

                                           16
    the rehabilitation of 321 km (total of IDA- and IBRD-financed road sections). About
    164 km of these were completed under the IBRD-financed Loan which exceeded the
    target indicator of 113 km by 45 percent.

    (b) Improving the effectiveness of road maintenance through the introduction of
    PBCs in the two pilot regions of Macva and Kolubara. This was fully achieved. The
    PBCs demonstrated substantial cost-effectiveness compared to traditional unit-based
    contracts used for road maintenance in the rest of the country. On average, the PERS
    estimated the cost effectiveness of PBCs at 46 percent during the period of 2005-2009
    (see Table 3.2.2) and 52 percent as of the closing date of the Bank-funded Project
    (Borrower’s Contribution to the ICR. January 2013, p. 82).

    (c) Introducing safe road design principles, road safety audits, and targeted
    improvement measures. This was fully achieved. Around 2007, the PERS introduced
    requirements to apply safety features in road works designs, to carry out systematic
    safety audits of all designs, and to implement the recommendations of road safety
    audits. This requirement is now a common practice under all projects, regardless of
    their source of financing. In total, 254 km of road sections under IDA- and IBRD-
    funding were covered by the road safety audits—which exceeded by 154 percent the
    target indicator of 100 km. In addition, the Project addressed 25 accident black
    spots—which exceeded by 67 percent the target of 15 blackspots.

3.3 Efficiency

3.3.1 Strictly speaking, efficiency in achieving the original PDO cannot be determined,
because no economic analysis was carried out at the time of the approval of Level-1
restructuring/AF. There was only one road section completed; the rest were either under
implementation or in the bidding process. However the fact that these road sections
when completed after the Level 1 restructuring/AF demonstrated satisfactory Economic

                                                 17
Internal Rates of Return (EIRR) (see paragraph 3.3.2), indicates that efficiency was
achieved.

3.3.2 Efficiency in achieving the revised PDO in terms of EIRR was rated as
Satisfactory because the ex-post EIRR for all fifteen roads was 38.7 percent, which is
above the 12 percent threshold and within the range of the ex-ante EIRR (20.4 percent-
94.3 percent) estimated at appraisal. The overall ex-ante EIRR for the seven roads
estimated at appraisal was 46.5%, and the overall ex-post EIRR for those seven roads was
46.3%. The results of the ex-post economic evaluation showed that the Project had a
robust economic justification. The full economic analysis—together with ex-ante and ex-
post EIRR for the 15 roads—are given in Annex 3

3.3.3 The economic analysis of the Project was undertaken at appraisal employing a
standard cost-benefit approach using the HDM-4, comparing VOCs, time expenditures
and accident cost savings in the ‘do-something scenario’, where the road is rehabilitated,
against the ‘do-minimum scenario’, where there is no intervention except the
continuation of the current maintenance regime. The ex-post evaluation was conducted
using the same HDM-4 model and the same main assumptions adopted at appraisal, but
taking into consideration actual road works costs and the actual traffic growth rate
observed from 2004-2011.

3.3.4 The appraisal economic evaluation conducted in 2004 evaluated the rehabilitation
on seven key sections of arterial highways—totaling 240.3 km—which accounted for 70
percent of the estimated total Project costs. All seven roads had an EIRR ranging from
20.4 percent – 94.3 percent. The ex-post economic evaluation was done for fifteen
Project road contracts—totaling 295.6 km and US$77.66 million of rehabilitation
expenditures—for which current traffic and actual road work costs were obtained.

3.3.5 The efficiency of the Project was negatively affected by the time overrun: the
Project closed three years and nine months later than originally planned. However, it was
positively balanced by the actual construction costs, which were on average 5 percent
lower than the contract costs—with a range of actual costs being 35 percent lower to 25
percent higher than the contract costs. Despite the European economic crisis in 2008 and
a series of major disruptive political events in the country in 2008-2009, the Project did
not experience substantial cost overruns. In addition, efficiency was positively affected
by significant achievements due to the SRD transformation into a public enterprise with
more modernized management practices. In particular, efficiency was achieved through
strengthening the capacity of the PERS in maintenance planning and programming based
on the HDM-4, harmonization of technical standards with EU standards, and road safety
management—and spreading the effects of these achievements beyond the Project’s
boundaries.

3.4 Justification of Overall Outcome Rating

Rating: Satisfactory

3.4.1 The achievement of the overall outcome was rated as Satisfactory. The overall
outcome against the original PDO was rated as moderately satisfactory. Efficiency was
not rated, because the works were not yet completed at that time, although a reasonable
argument can be made for a satisfactory rating on efficiency against the original PDO
(see paragraphs 3.3.1 and 3.3.2). The overall outcome against the revised PDO was rated
as Satisfactory. Both outcomes were weighted in proportion to the share of actual credit
and loan disbursements made before and after the approval of the Level-1 restructuring.
The final rating was Satisfactory, after rounding up to the nearest whole number. The
summary of the assessments is provided in table 3.4.1.

3.5 Overarching Themes, Other Outcomes and Impacts
(a) Poverty Impacts, Gender Aspects, and Social Development

3.5.1 The Project provided social and economic benefits to the rural and municipal
communities living close to the Project road sections. Road users benefited from travel
time and cost savings, more comfortable travel, lower pollution and noise levels, safer
roads, and improved access to private buildings. In addition, the Project realized
economic benefits to the local communities: employment of local population,
engagement of local suppliers for provision of materials and equipment required for the
works, and increased trade activities in local surroundings of the sites. Details are
provided in Annex 5 and Table 5.1.




                                                    19
(b) Institutional Change/Strengthening

3.5.2 The major institutional changes could be grouped into five categories: (i)
institutional sector reform; (ii) introduction of systematic maintenance planning and
programming based on a network analysis (using the HDM-4); (iii) piloting of PBCs for
maintenance of roads, (iv) harmonization of technical standards with EU standards; and
(v) introduction of a new Traffic Safety Law and road safety capacity building.

3.5.3 On January 1, 2006, the SRD was transformed into a Public Enterprise “Roads of
Serbia? (PERS) with six departments: (i) Investment; Maintenance; (ii) Planning and
Design; (iii) Quality-Safety-Environment; (iv) Finance (including toll collection); and (v)
Legal. The transformation helped strengthen the management capacity through the
introduction of greater managerial autonomy and more modernized design-making
processes, increase of salaries, and an independent financing stream dedicated to road
maintenance and investment.

3.5.4 The TRP supported better planning by establishing the national road asset database,
and introducing systematic maintenance planning and programming based on sound
economic efficiency criteria (using the HDM4). In addition, condition surveys for the
entire National Road Network were conducted under TRP in 2008, and were used in the
preparation of RRSP.

3.5.5 Serbia was the first of the World Bank client countries in the Europe and Central
Asia region to pilot a PBC approach. While this project cannot take credit for introducing
the PBC approach in the country, it did support the actual application of PBCs and the
implementation of two contracts in two pilot regions. See Annex 2 for more details on
PBCs.

3.5.6 The PERS and the overall Serbian road sector substantially benefitted from
Consulting Services for Innovation/Harmonization of Technical Standards with the EU
Standards. This Consultancy produced for the Republic of Serbia: (i) a manual for road
design; (ii) identification of Technical conditions for constructing roads; (iii) standard
drawings of road details; (iv) instructions for road maintenance; and (v) a manual for the
supervision of road works. It resulted in a series of legislative proposals to achieve better
harmonization with the EU standards.

3.5.7 The TRP substantially contributed toward building the PERS’s capacity (through
trainings and study visits) in carrying out road safety audits and inspections. This
eventually led to the establishment of a stand-alone road safety engineering unit in the
PERS. In addition, the GOS took advantage of the Bank’s presence in the country and
requested the assistance of the Global Road Safety Facility—administered by the Bank—
to undertake a road safety management capacity review (RSCR). The review was
completed in 2008. The results of the review contributed to the formulation of a new
Road Safety Law, adopted in May 2009. The Law represented the first major update in
legislation since the 1980s, and addressed many aspects of the EU Transport Acquis
Communautaire. As a follow-up to the RSCR, the ongoing Bank-funded Corridor X
Highway Project (CXHP) is supporting: (i) road safety capacity building, (ii) the creation
                                             20
of a road safety performance framework, (iii) the development and launching of a
national road safety strategy, and (iv) the preparation and piloting of multi-sectoral road
safety projects.

(c) Other Unintended Outcomes and Impacts (positive or negative)

3.5.8 The Project supported the development of a Communication Strategy to establish
a dialogue between the PERS and the general public on the benefits of PBCs in the
Macva and Kolubara regions. Later on, the PERS built upon this experience and scaled
up its Communication Strategy to cover the entire country. While the benefits have not
fully realized yet, RRSP looks to capitalize on this strategy in supporting the further use
of PBCs.

3.6 Summary of Findings of Beneficiary Survey and/or Stakeholder Workshops

Not applicable, because this is a core ICR.

4. Assessment of Risk to Development Outcome
Rating: Moderate

4.1      The risk that the achieved development outcomes would not be sustained was
rated as moderate. The sustainability of road investments, the effectiveness of sector
institutions, the plans for improvement and scaling up of PBCs, and the mainstreaming of
road safety improvement activities in Serbia’s road sector management are most likely to
continue receiving attention and support from the GOS, the Bank, EIB and EBRD.
However, anticipated further shrinking of the European economy may affect the
Government’s priorities—and this increased the rating from Low/Negligible to Moderate.

5. Assessment of Bank and Borrower Performance
(relating to design, implementation and outcome issues)

5.1 Bank Performance
(a) Bank Performance in Ensuring Quality at Entry

Rating: Moderately Satisfactory

5.1.1 The Bank performance in ensuring the quality at entry was rated as Moderately
Satisfactory. The Bank Team prepared a Project with a simplified design and re-
negotiated the Project within a month to accommodate a more than two fold increase in
the credit size and substantial scope expansion, and met all minimum Bank requirements
despite a quick Project preparation. However, there were some missed opportunities in
the QER and some deficiencies in the quality of the documentation (e.g., PAD) and
definition of the PDO.

5.1.2 During Project preparation, the Bank Team had difficulty in clearly prioritizing
the needs of the GOS in the transport sector, because the country was recovering from a
long-term conflict, and its needs were immense. By targeting a large number of sub-

                                              21
sectors, the original Project design was overly ambitious. The Project preparation took
longer than expected—by about 2 years. The Project Team changed, the design was
simplified to focus solely on the road sector, and the Project was delivered within a 6-
month period. It was even re-negotiated within a month, as the credit size increased from
$25 to $55 million and the Project scope expanded.

5.1.3 The ICR Team concurred with the QAG’s conclusion and rating of the Bank
inputs and processes as moderately satisfactory due to some scope for improvement with
missed opportunities in the QER and Project documentation for greater clarity. The
Project Team was commended for (i) “seeking simplicity in Project design; (ii) trying a
new modality that relied on the private sector (maintenance by contract) on a pilot basis
in two regions—thus, providing Serbia the opportunity to assess the benefits and
potential problems of the new approach; and (iii) introducing network analysis, which
should result in a better prioritization of investment in the future.?

5.1.4 The QAG noted that (i) the PAD lacked “a forward-looking discussion of the
sector finances in more depth?; and (ii) the PAD “did not reflect fully all the changes in
Project design? after the credit was increased and the Project was expanded in scope. In
several places there were still references to the older Project concept, and even to the
early intention to address transport sector issues in general. The other two deficiencies
were that: (i) the PDO definition was too narrow in focusing on two major activities
rather than fully encompassing all Project activities; and (ii) the monitoring indicators
were not very well linked to the PDO. While the Bank Team is to be commended for the
preparation and renegotiation of the Project at short notice in order to double the size of
the credit and expand a number of Project activities, it is plausible that most, if not all, of
those inconsistencies and deficiencies were mainly due to the accelerated preparation
schedule.

(b) Quality of Supervision
(including of fiduciary and safeguards policies)
Rating: Satisfactory

5.1.5 The quality of the Bank’s supervision was rated as Satisfactory, because the Bank
Team was proactive and collaborative during Project implementation and made a
substantial contribution to ensuring the relevance of the PDO, achievement of the PDO
and successful implementation of the Project. When the rehabilitation contracts started
running into cost and time overruns, the Bank Team arranged an intensive stand-alone
supervision mission to identify the source of the problems. The recommendations were
immediately taken on board as soon as the designs of new road sections were initiated for
the preparation of the AF. The SNRA needed to help build the road safety capacity of the
PERS through the Twinning Arrangements. The PERS turned to the Bank for its
expertise in this area, and this led to an increased financing of new road safety activities.
When the Bank Team found out that additional works had been executed without the
PERS having first sought the Bank’s no objection, it insisted on implementing new road
safety measures within the GOS’s budget to reduce the increased risk of road traffic
crashes.


                                                   22
5.1.6 The AF/Level-1 Restructuring could have easily been classified as a completely
stand-alone Project (with a different PDO, different set of indicators, 4 instead of 2
components, and an IBRD loan instead of an IDA credit). While this AF complicated the
ICR preparation, the Bank is nevertheless to be commended for taking the risk of
preparing the AF under a very uncertain political situation in the country—and thereby
contributing to scaling up the benefits of the Project.

5.1.7 The Bank Team could have given more sufficient attention to M&E—reporting in
the AMs and ISRs on indicators was inconsistent and irregular. There was also some
minor differences in the definitions of the indicators in various Project documents. The
Project Papers for two Level-2 Restructurings should have referred to the revised PDO,
rather than the original one. However, these were relatively inconsequential shortcomings
that did not affect the successful implementation of the Project.

(c) Justification of Rating for Overall Bank Performance
Rating: Moderately Satisfactory

5.1.8 The MS rating was based on the Bank’s moderately satisfactory performance in
ensuring quality at entry, and on its satisfactory performance during Project
implementation.

5.2 Borrower Performance
(a) Government Performance

Rating: Satisfactory

5.2.1 The Borrower’s performance was rated as Satisfactory. During Project
preparation, the GOS demonstrated a high level of commitment to the Project and to
reforms in the road sector. The GOS initiated the two pilot PBC contracts, and secured
the Bank financing for them. The Borrower co-financed all Project activities: 10 percent
for all goods and works, and 20 percent for all services. However, the Sector Ministry
and the MOF did not help the Bank in determining key priorities/needs for the Project—
which led to an overly ambitious original design and a lengthy Project preparation.

5.2.2 During the seven-and-half-year Project implementation, the GOS and the Minister
of Finance changed five times—however, this did not cause major disruptions. In
addition, the GOS demonstrated a high level of commitment to the Project: it did not wait
for the AF to become effective to rehabilitate—with its own budget—the road sections,
and extend for an additional 3 years the PBCs included in the AF.

(b) Implementing Agency (IA) or Agencies Performance
Rating: Satisfactory

5.2.3 The performance of the Implementing Agency—the SRD/PERS—was rated as
Satisfactory. The SRD/PERS demonstrated a very high commitment by: (i) ensuring
continuous capacity building and continuity of the PIT; (ii) quickly admitting its
unintentional mistakes and incorporating lessons learned; and (iii) financing some of the

                                            23
Project activities from its own budget rather than waiting for the AF. Despite the frequent
change of the top management of the SRD, the core team remained the same and even
enhanced its professional capacity. However, it was beyond its control to affect the sole-
source award of PBCs to regional contractors (see Section D in Annex 2).


(c) Justification of Rating for Overall Borrower Performance
Rating: Satisfactory

5.2.4 The overall S rating was assigned due to the S performance of the Borrower, as
described above.

6. Lessons Learned

6.1     The Borrower’s/IA’s initiative has a greater chance to succeed than one
promoted by IFIs. PERS’s commitment to the introduction of PBCs was critical to the
early success of the intervention. When such ownership and commitment exists, the
Bank should work closely to support the government. In this case, the Bank, together
with EIB and EBRD who have showed commitment to the same agenda, should continue
helping the GOS realize that the cost-effectiveness of PBCs can be achieved through: (i)
breaking up the monopoly of regional contractors who receive routine maintenance
contracts under traditional unit-based contracts without competition; and (ii) introducing
more output-based services in the PBCs. Given the current presence of the Bank with the
ongoing Corridor X Project and the RRSP, which is under preparation, the Bank should
continue to monitor the implementation of PBCs, and to support the GOS in improving
the PBC bidding documents and strengthening the capacity of the public and private
sectors.

6.2 Recommendations of road safety audits should be directly incorporated into the
road designs at the earlier stages of the design process. This has become a requirement
and was regularized in Serbia’s new Traffic Safety Law, which became effective in 2011.
Designs should also incorporate forecasts for further deterioration of conditions before
the actual construction starts. The forthcoming Bank-funded RRSP is designed to ensure
that road safety considerations are incorporated into road designs, and ultimately
institutionalized in design standards.

6.3    Contractors should have staff specifically responsible for implementation and
monitoring of EMPs, in order to ensure compliant environmental safeguards
implementation. In case of incompliance, penalties should be introduced to enforce the
contractors’ environmental obligations.

6.4     Closer collaboration with the ministries responsible for utilities should be
achieved prior to the start of the civil works. Timely relocation of utilities in road
projects without creating hazardous situations could be done either through: (i) an MoU
between the sector Ministry responsible for the road project, the implementing road
agency and the sector Ministry and subordinate Government agency responsible for the
concerned utilities; or (ii) the involvement of a high-level management representative
                                            24
from the Government agency in charge of the concerned utilities in the Project Steering
Committee.


7. Comments on Issues Raised by the Borrower/Implementing Agencies/Partners
(a) Borrower/Implementing Agencies

7.1     On January 25, 2013, the Borrower/IA submitted to the Bank “Borrower’s
Contribution to the ICR for the TRP (update received on March 6, 2013) . The 161 page
report presents great details of each civil works contract and consultancy service, and the
other chapters on the PDO. Project components are summarized in Annex 2 of the ICR.
The chapters on “Assessment of the Outcomes of the Project, Relevance of Project
Objectives and Goals, Lessons Learned, Borrower and Bank Performance? and tables
with Project Progress Indicators without editing are enclosed in Annex 7. The Borrower
also commented favorably on the Bank’s ICR. The Borrower’s entire report together
with its attachments (annexes) is available in the Project files.

B. A Complete List of Project Indicators of the Original TRP

As the TRP was appraised in 2004, its results framework followed a different results
framework format than the one which is used by current projects. The main text of the
PAD lists three key performance indicators:
    (i)    Improved maintenance systems in two pilot districts within fixed budget
           envelopes;
    (ii)   Lower costs and improved quality and safety in road segment rehabilitation
           projects following competitive procedures; and
    (iii) Increased capability of SRD to procure road works competitively and
           objectively supervise their implementation.

Annex 1 “Project Design Summary? of the PAD is comprised of 14 indicators of
different levels: sector indicators, outcome/impact indicators, output indicators and inputs.

                                            30
For the purpose of the PDO evaluation in this ICR, only outcome/impact indicators were
used. A complete list of the original project indicators is given below:

 (i) Sector indicators:
        (a) Reduced transport costs;
        (b) Level of performance of SRD;
(ii) Outcome/Impact Indicators:
        (g) Improved routine and periodic maintenance systems in two pilot districts
             within fixed budget envelope;
        (h) Lower costs and improved quality in road segment rehabilitation projects
             following competitive procurement procedures;
        (i) Improved road safety condition; and
        (j) Increased capability of SRD to procure road works competitively and
             supervise objectively their implementation;
(iii) Output Indicators:
        (a) The SRD’s Information Center data base for road and bridge condition, traffic
             and accidents is computerized and operational;
        (b) A methodology for planning and budgeting road expenditures is in place;
        (c) About 20 staff of SRD have been trained;
        (d) Post construction audits indicate compliance with agreed road standards and
             approved designs;
        (e) All routine and periodic maintenance at pilots are carried out by a three-year
             contract; and
        (f) The number of accidents has been reduced by 5 percent;
(iv) Inputs (budget for each component):
        (a) US$6.41 million; and
        (b) US$48.59 million.

The same Annex 1 had a table with specific definitions for:
(i) Outcome/impact indicators:
        (a) Average road roughness at pilots Macva and Kolubara (m/km);
        (b) Average road roughness in road segments rehabilitation (m/km);
        (c) Improved road safety: number of deaths per 10,000 vehicles;
        (d) Number of competitively awarded and implemented contracts;
        (e) Perception of road conditions in Macva and Kolubara regions (1= very poor,
5= very good); and
        (f) perception of road safety in Macva and Kolumbara regions (1= very unsafe, 5=
very safe) ;
(ii) Output indicators:
        (a) SRD’s IC data base computerized and operational (percent of completion);
        (b) Planning and budgeting road expenditure methodology (percent of
             completion); and
        (c) Number of SRD staff trained.

The project had an Additional Financing (AF) Loan in 2007 which was also a Level-1
Restructuring. At the time of the AF, the PDO was amended to ensure a better fit with the

                                           31
scope and nature of the activities in the expanded project. The Bank project team which
had changed by the time of the AF felt that the original PDO did not really do justice to
the activities of the project. The PDO was amended to become “to assist the Government
of Serbia in reducing road user 5 cost and improving safety for road users through: (a)
improving the condition of selected road sections of the main and regional road network;
(b) improving the effectiveness of road maintenance through the introduction of
performance-based contracting in two pilot regions; and (c) introducing safe road design
principles, road safety audits and targeted improvement measures.?

The old results framework (RF) was replaced with a new one to have monitoring
indicators better reflecting the revised PDO and changes in the project activities and its
scope. The main text of the Project Paper (PP) of the AF outlined the following key
performance indicators to monitor progress towards the revised PDO:

            (i) reduction in road user costs on the rehabilitated road sections;
            (ii) reduction in unit costs for routine and winter maintenance activities in the two
            pilot regions;
            (iii) improved capacity in the Public Enterprise “Roads of Serbia? (PERS) 6 to
            manage road maintenance and rehabilitation programs, reflected by the
            establishment of the Road and Bridge Database; and
            (iv) improved road safety, reflected by the length of road subjected to road safety
            audits, and the number of addressed ‘black spots’.

The RF Annex of the PP included the first two indicators and the fourth one as project
outcome indicators, which are used for the purpose of the assessment of the revised PDO
achievement in this ICR. The above third indicator was omitted in the list of the PDO
indicators, but incorrectly spelt as “Road Accident Database established and operational?
in the list of intermediate outcome indicators in the RF of the PP. Overall, the RF was
comprised of three project outcome indicators and six intermediate outcome indicators.

The definitions of the indicators were slightly different in the RF than in the
Arrangements for Results Monitoring Matrix (Matrix). The difference was that
definitions for some indicators (see below indicators 1, 6, 8, 9) were rather general in the
RF but more specific and detailed for the same indicators in the Matrix. There was no
consistency in the definition for the indicator related to output and performance based
contracts (indicator 2 in the RF) in the RF and the Matrix: the definition in the RF was
concentrated on reduction in unit costs, while the one in the Matrix on satisfactory
piloting (no experience vs solid experience). Moreover, indicator 2 in the RF was closer
by its definition to intermediate outcome indicator 6 in the RF and indicator 6 in the
Matrix. Indicator 7 in the Matrix did not include “action plan produced? as it was
mentioned in the definition of the same indicator 7 in the RF.

As a result of the substitution of the priority road sections for rehabilitation during the
level-two restructuring in March 2010, the length of road to be rehabilitated increased
from 113 km to 157 km which resulted in a change in the amount of the Intermediate
Output for Component 1 in the RF.

C. Funding Allocations

The amount of the project increased from US$55 million to US$105 million after the
approval of the AF (IBRD loan)/Level-1 restructuring in the amount of US$50 million on
June 20, 2007. Those US$50 million were re-allocated between the new four components
suggested under the AF, while the original US$55 million were expected to be fully spent
on the original two components of the parent Project.

The June 2011 restructuring involved reallocation of funds and retrospective change in
the financing parameters. The latter was requested by the Government and agreed on an

                                              33
exceptional basis as a response to the impact of the economic crisis. The changes
included:
(i)    Within IDA Credit:
        (a) SDR 200,000 was reallocated from the category of Consulting Services to the
            Category of Works, with the revised amount of SDR33,340,000 for Works,
            and SDR 3,470,000 for Consulting Services;
        (b) a retroactive increase in the disbursement percentages for categories of
            Works, Goods and Consultant services from 91%, 90% and 80% respectively
            to 100% for all eligible payments. This change was introduced for all eligible
            payments for the years 2009, 2010, and 2011. The proposed disbursement
            percentages were completely within the approved country financing
            parameters for Serbia;

(ii)   Within IBRD Credit:
       (a) a retroactive increase in the disbursement percentages under all categories to
           100% for all eligible payments. For eligible payments, this change was
           expected to take effect from the date of effectiveness of the Financing
           Agreement, December 16, 2008. The proposed disbursement percentages
           were completely within the approved country financing parameters for Serbia;
       (b) a reallocation from the category of Goods to the category of Works in the
           amount of EUR 600,000, because the planned computer equipment had
           already been funded from other sources;
       (c) a reallocation from the category of Consulting Services to the category of
           Works in the amount of Euro 390,000.

D. Implementation of Performance Based Contracts in Two Pilot Regions

The TRP supported hybrid Performance Based Maintenance Contracts (PBMC) for about
1,100 km on the National Road Network in the Macva and Kolubara regions which
resulted in significant savings in comparison to the unit price approach described above
and demonstrated the potential of this contracting approach. The Bidding Documents
were developed through the Twinning Arrangements with the Swedish Road
Administration (SRA); the award of the contracts was done through open competition.
Routine maintenance in the PBMC pilots consists mostly of winter maintenance and such
summer maintenance works that do not require significant civil works. Pothole patching
usually is included in routine maintenance but larger repaving works are not.

PBMC pilots introduced savings of up to 40 percent in winter season and demonstrated
other advantages over the standard input based contract. These include:
    • Providing PERS with financial certainty of the final costs of the provided
        services;
    • Increasing competition among bidders and making the contract implementation
        process more transparent;
    • Increasing the responsibilities of the contractors on their service obligations and
        empowering them to play a more active role in the preservation of road assets;
    • Simplifying PERS’s role in the control of quality and quantity of the executed
        works which requires less resources; and
    • PBMC significantly reduces the costs of routine maintenance; decreases
        consumption of salt and solvents for winter maintenance due to the use of road
        weather information system.

While Serbia’s National Transport Strategy is to reform public road maintenance, the
PBMC pilots were scaled back once funding from the TRP ended. During the 18-month
period of waiting for the effectiveness of the AF, the GOS extended implementation of
two PBC to regional maintenance contactors not on a competitive basis, but on a sole-
source basis.

The GOS and the World Bank are finalizing the preparation of a new project which will
support improving PBMC documents, capacity of the PERS and contractors. At the close
of the Project, a target 2,000 km of national roads is expected be under implementation
using PBMC and an additional 1000 being tendered. Expanding PBMC would increase
efficiency and transparency in Serbian maintenance practices and enhance the
sustainability of road investments. The PERS has recently submitted an application for a
€1.5 million IPA grant to the EC to finance the development of a strategic plan for the
wide application of PBMC and the preparation of associated tender documents.
Tendering is expected to start in late 2014. Contracts will be 3 to 5 years long. Given the
importance of expanding competitive and modern maintenance contracting arrangements
to Serbia, the new project will support the implementation of PBMC and supplement the
funding of the EC if necessary. In addition, the Project will fund the PBMC training for
staff of private contractors and the PERS.

Annex 3. Economic and Financial Analysis
(including assumptions in the analysis)

The economic analysis of the project was undertaken at appraisal employing standard
cost-benefit approach using the Highway Development and Management Model (HDM-
4), comparing vehicle operating costs, time expenditures and accident costs savings in the
‘do-something scenario’, where the road is rehabilitated, against the ‘do-minimum
scenario’, where there is no intervention, except the continuation of the current
maintenance regime.

The appraisal economic evaluation done in 2004 evaluated the rehabilitation on seven
key sections of arterial highways, totaling 240.3 km, which accounted for 70 percent of
the estimated total project costs. The seven roads evaluated at appraisal are given in the
table below.

The appraisal economic evaluation adopted an appraisals period of 11 years and a
discount rate of 12 percent. Traffic was forecasted to grow at 6 percent per annum for
passenger cars in the first year of the project, declining to 4.3 percent per annum in the
final years of the project. The comparable rates for buses and truck are 3.5 percent and
3.0 percent, and 4.0 percent and 4.3 percent, respectively. The results of the appraisal
economic evaluation showed that the seven road sections performed well with regard to
the standard criteria for measuring the performance of the investment. All the seven roads
had an Economic Rate of Return (ERR) above the 12 percent threshold, with ERR
ranging from 20.4 to 94.3 percent.

The ex-post economic evaluation was done for fifteen project roads contracts, totaling
295.6 km and US$ 77.66 million of rehabilitation expenditures, for which current traffic
and actual road work costs were obtained. The ex-post evaluation was done using the
HDM-4 model, adopting the same main assumptions adopted at appraisal, but
considering actual road works costs and the actual traffic growth rate observed from 2004
to 2011. The table below presents the road sections for which an ex-post economic
evaluation was done for the ICR.

Most of the project roads are Asphalt Concrete roads that were in fair to poor condition
before the road works. The average roughness of the road sections before the road works
was 4.5 IRI, m/km. The table below presents the basic road sections characteristics.

The table below presents the observed Average Annual Daily Traffic (AADT) on the
project roads from 2004 to 2011. The observed annual traffic growth rate per year from
2004 to 2011, on the project roads, varies from -7.3 to 5.9 percent per year, with an
average of 0.5 percent per year. Thus, on average, the traffic on the project roads grew
from 2004 to 2011 at a slower pace than what was estimated at appraisal (4.3 percent per
year for cars and truck and 3.0 percent per year for buses).

The ex-post economic evaluation was done considering the actual costs of the road works
per road section and the actual observed traffic annual growth rate from 2004 to 2011.
The ex-post economic evaluation shows that the fifteen roads have an ex-post ERR above
the 12 percent threshold and the overall ex-post ERR of the project is 38.7 percent. The
overall ex-ante ERR for the seven roads estimated at appraisal is 46.5 percent, while the
overall ex-post ERR is 46.3 percent. The results of the ex-post economic evaluation show
that the project had a robust economic justification.

Annex 5. Beneficiary Survey Results

The PERS collected the data through the concerned contractors to determine the social
and economic benefits the project provided to the rural and municipal communities living
close to the project road sections. As a result of improved road conditions, road users
benefited from travel time and cost savings, more comfortable travel, lower pollution and
noise levels, safer roads as a result of improved road safety infrastructure (provision of
road signs, bus stops, sidewalks, etc.), improved accesses to private buildings, and others
In addition, the project realized the following economic benefits to the local
communities: employment of local population, engagement of local suppliers for
provision of materials and equipment required for the works, and increased trade
activities in local surrounding of the sites. Please see Table 5.1 for more details.

In five listed above contracts, a total of 500 local workers were employed and generated
1,882 man months of employment during the construction period. In addition, these
roads provided inter-connection to about 60 local roads, approaches to 211 houses and
other facilities such as gas stations, restaurants, villages, schools, Police station, estates,
etc. access to 20 agriculture fields and 18 other improvements such as repairs near
schools pedestrian paths, drainage, fixing protective ramps, etc. In addition local people
also benefitted from renting out their houses to the contractors and their employees, and
their vacant spaces for the storage of the construction materials, which thus supplemented
the household incomes.

The Borrower/IA submitted to the Bank “Borrower’s Contribution to Implementation
Completion and Results Report (ICR)? for the TRP on January 25, 2013 and an update on
March 6, 2013. The report contains 161 pages. The report consists of several chapters,
including Introduction; PDO, Project Components and Economic Analysis; Project
Implementation; Financial Data; Assessment of the Outcomes of the Project; Relevance
of Project Objectives and Goals; Lessons Learned; Borrower and Bank Performance; and
four Attachments (Annexes). Since the Contribution presents great details of each civil
works contract and consultancy services, and the other chapters on the PDO, project
components are summarized in Annex 2 of the ICR, and it was decided to enclose the
chapters on “Assessment of the Outcomes of the Project, Relevance of Project Objectives
and Goals, Lessons Learned, Borrower and Bank Performance? and tables with Project
Progress Indicators without editing in this Annex. The Borrower’s entire report together
with its attachments (annexes) is available in the Project files.

The Borrower commented favorably on the Bank’s ICR:

“5. Assessment of the Outcomes of the Project

Generally speaking, implementation of the Project brought numerous benefits. Road
rehabilitations contributed to the development of local communities and municipalities
where the road was located. Besides obvious positive outcomes for road users such as
shorter and more comfortable travel time, reduced travelling costs, lower pollution and
noise levels, improved signage and safer roads for use, additional benefits were achieved
from the social point of use – the rehabilitation works also covered construction of
accesses to private buildings along the rehabilitated sections, employment of local
population, engagement of local suppliers for provision of materials and equipment
required for the Works, increased trade activities in local surrounding of the sites. Part of
the supervision activities under the IBRD Loan also covered reporting on the social
aspect of the Project, which was also a novelty applied on this Project. For example, for
the purpose of Pavement rehabilitation-upgrading of the regional road R-101, section:
Obrenovac – Ub out of total of 130 workers engaged on the Works, 30 were locals
(workers from communities located along the section that were not previously employed
by the Contractor), i.e. 23.1% of the workmanship was outsourced; 4 local companies
were additionally engaged for rental of machines, transport of materials and supply of
materials, while more than 60 accesses were treated (simple Works, on short segments,
asphalt surfacing). On the Gladnoš – Inđija section (M-22.1) during the Works
implementation out of 114 workers, 39 (34.2%) were workers from communities located
along the section that were not permanently employed by the Contractor and more than
20 accesses were treated.

Considering the environmental safeguard, closer attention was paid to environmental
monitoring, as the obligation of this monitoring was placed both on the Contractor and
the Supervision. The Contractor was obliged to mitigate the negative effects of the Works
on environment and to keep them within the stipulated limits, but also to prepare the

                                             46
EMP before the commencement of the Works and comply with the items stated therein.
On the other side, the role of the Supervising Consultant was to control the
implementation of measures stated by the accepted EMP and to perform constant
measurements to follow the effects of the works on environment. Although at the initial
stage of the Project with had some difficulties as the Contractors were not well
acquainted with appliance of environmental protection measures in accordance with the
stated policies and rules, and Supervision did not initially understand the seriousness of
requirement for environmental monitoring, the Employer’s approach and clear definition
of requirements under the relevant contract provisions facilitated the whole process and
gave “on-job? training. As number of contracts and procurements under the Project
increased, both Consultants and Contractors (construction companies) got more interested
in their obligations towards this aspect and therefore their performance increased.

The Pilot project of routine and winter maintenance represented one of the most
important components of the Project as almost 20% of the TRP estimated value referred
to the Pilot project. The road maintenance concept previously applied in maintenance of
Serbian roads, which is still dominant in Serbia, represents the outdated concept. The
Pilot project was to determine the adequate road maintenance model on one side and to
verify a new concept for contracting the maintenance works which would be acceptable
for developing countries.

The maintenance contract represented a combination of standard type of contracting the
works which was usually applied for contracting the civil works for road reconstruction
and rehabilitation, which implied payments based on actually performed quantities and
contacted unit prices and a new concept of contracting a road maintenance work applied
in modern counties which was based on performance of the contractor and quality of the
service from a road user’s view point where the payment is to be made based on
determined lump sum amounts.

The applied type of contract was hybrid and unique in the world and as such was
classified as Pilot project.

The first two years of Pilot project implementation brought unquestionable positive
results. From the employer’s point of view, the costs of routine maintenance were
reduced; the bidding process was based on market principles and was transparent, at the
same time stimulating participation of the private sector.

New method of measurement and payment of the maintenance works reduced the
supervision costs and also provided contractor with possibility to increase its own profit.

The new maintenance principle also required introduction of new technologies and
information systems which stimulated the contractors to increase their own knowledge on
new technologies and modern equipment for the maintenance works. The contractors,
thorough these contracts, were also stimulated to improve their own efficiency as their
own organization of work and timely reactions were crucial for the gaining the profit.



                                            47
The quality of the works was checked thorough the contractor’s unit for internal control.
In this way the contractor partially took over the role of supervision (controlled itself) and
in this way the contractor guaranteed the quality of the service.

Quality verification, based on which the payments were made, was performed by a small
number of the engaged supervision staff and with significantly reduced supervision costs
paid separately by the employer. Reduced payments for the works of poor quality or the
works that were not completed within the stated time were calculated by appliance of
demerit points. Demerit points were stated as a measure to motivate the contractor to
react timely and in organized manner and to perform the works of good quality.

well as unit cost of winter maintenance during the period 2005-2011.

Besides the transfer of knowledge on maintenance, cooperation with Swedish expert
brought numerous positive experiences as employees of the PERS (SRD at that time)
were introduced to basic principles of PBC contracts. Training organized on the premises
of the PERS was used as the opportunity to acquaint the stakeholders in Serbia with a
new maintenance principle applied through a Pilot Project. Additionally, the Twinning
Agreement also brought a joint work with PERS staff on Road Safety Inspection for
some of the sections completed under the IDA Credit. This enabled better understanding
of traffic safety requirements during the phase of design preparation, but also during the
road construction work and in the post-construction phase. We believe that the positive
experience from this cooperation together with further development of PERS staff in this
issue will have its most obvious outcomes under the new Project where consideration of
traffic safety requirements will be

Most of designs based on which rehabilitation works under the IDA credit were done
were prepared several years before the rehabilitation (2000-2003) and these designs did
not separately treat the traffic safety aspect.

After the completed rehabilitation on two road sections in total length of 44 km, RSI was
implemented on these sections during 2006 and 20007. Road Safety Inspection was
realized as training of multidisciplinary teams under the Twining Agreement. The teams
were composed of traffic engineers, civil engineers, representatives of police, relevant
ministries and design institutes. Special attention was paid to the requirement that the

                                                     49
team composition need to be gender sensitive i.e. both men and women were selected as
team members.

After the RSI, correction of observed deficiencies from the traffic safety aspect was done
wherever possible as the rehabilitation works were completed and there were some
financial limitations for the measures to be applied. Some of the observed issues were
improved by construction of pedestrian crossing, improvement of lighting, placement of
guardrails and fences on certain dangerous locations, removal of remained material from
the road and removal of temporary signage that stayed after the section opening to traffic.

Based on the experience with appliance of road safety inspection after the road
rehabilitation, it was noted that it is necessary to have the RSA introduced during the
design preparation phase.

As the TRP extension became effective and as designs for pavement rehabilitation on the
TRP sections were completed, it was not possible to have the full procedure for RSI and
RSA implemented. Although the IDA credit Procurement Plan included the item of
Consulting Services for Road Safety Audit, and although the procedure was started, due
to different opinions on level of certification required for the Services and available
budget, the procurement was cancelled. The Road Safety Inspection for app. 210 km was
done as part of the Consulting Services for Supervision of Road Rehabilitation Works
and Environmental Monitoring through increasing the scope of initially contracted
Services and after the approval of the World Bank. The experienced staff was engaged
and their CVs were sent to the World Bank for approval before the performance of the
RSI task.

In 2009, during the TRP implementation, new Law on Traffic Safety was enforced and it
brought novelties in regards to appliance of road safety audit and road safety inspection
on all national roads. This law also brought some changes in requirements for traffic
signage placed on roads of different categories.

The result of these changes brought by the law was that before contracting the Works on
the section Gladnoš - Inđija on M-22.1, the PERS had to amend the existing traffic
signage design to correspond to the requirements of the new law. For this particular case,
we had a chance to apply the Road Safety Audit during the phase of amendment of
design for traffic signage and road furniture. The presence of the audit and compliance
with stricter requirements of the new Law resulted in better quality design which did not
have deficiencies from the traffic safety point of view.

Although there were some difficulties under the Consulting Services for Road Data Base
resulting from internal disputes of partners in JV (Consultant performing the Services),
the result of the Services was good – the contracted surveys were completed and the
Road Data Base was updated. The data from this base were used in preparation of some
new Projects and for planning of new investments in Serbian road network.




                                            50
The Contract for IC Services of Program Analyses and Performance Indicators was
successfully completed and provided the Employer with the input data for planning of a
new Project.

The Contract for the Consulting Services for Innovation/Harmonization of Road
Technical Instructions/Guidelines According to EU Standards was very important for the
Enterprise as after the satisfactory performance of the Consultant it resulted in series of
proposals for improvement of current regulations to make them better harmonized with
EU standards. From the aspect of intention of the Republic of Serbia to join the EU, the
Services are given even greater significance especially when the fact that the Consultant
performing the Services originated from the EU member country. Additionally, the
outcome of the Services was also joint work of stakeholders from various state
institutions (Ministries, faculties, design companies, etc) and the Consultant which
resulted in prepared set of instructions/guidelines in the field of designing, construction
and road maintenance, as well as supervision of construction and maintenance Works.

Successful realization of procurement of goods such as road weather information systems,
specialized software, traffic counters, etc. enabled modernization of the road management
process and PERS employees were trained for work with use of modern information
technologies.

A sequence of training enabled development of greater number of PERS employees and
their improvement in many aspects of their work – contract management, project
planning and implementation, cost analyses for future Works, use of modern equipment
and new technologies, but also provided them with more detailed knowledge of
procurement policies and rules of various financing institutions, dominantly World Bank.

6.     Relevance of Project Objective and Goals

The PDOs initially stated for the IDA part of the Project implied improvement of the
effectiveness of the policies of SRD for road maintenance and rehabilitation through the
introduction of new contracting arrangements with the private sector in two pilot districts,
and, enhance the sustainability of the use of network analysis in the selection of road
rehabilitation segments and had to be amended because they did not explicitly mentioned
the rehabilitation of road segments or improvement of road safety. Therefore, the PDOs
were amended to better reflect the Project activates and scope of the Project.

Whilst a small minority of the project items were not eventually achieved this does not
mean that the project objectives or goals are diminished by this incompletion. At the end
of the Project life it is the Borrower’s opinion that the project objectives and goals were
all relevant.

7.     Lessons Learned

Total number of procurements started under the Project amounted to 46 and involved 160
bidders, consultants and suppliers. Total number of kilometers rehabilitated under the

                                            51
project amounted to app. 330 km. The works were performed by 15 different construction
companies that acted independently or through a joint venture. Considering the size of the
country and number of domestic companies where it should be kept in mind that most of
the foreign construction companies acted with use of local branch offices, equipment and
staff, it may be said that knowledge of WB procurement rules and implementation of
internationally financed contacts was widely spread throughout Serbia.

Initial difficulties at the early stage of the Project and consequent delays resulted from the
fact that significant number of bidders who became contractors for the first time faced the
contracting according to the procedures of the World Bank. The time estimated for the
period between the contract signing and site position in most cases was exceeded because
contractors were unprepared to act in accordance with the rules of the procedure. This
particularly refers to provision of performance guarantees and insurance policies which
was even more difficult at the time of economic crises when commercial banks and
insurance companies expanded their requirements for issuing these documents.
Considering this issue, the procurement processes for the future projects will be more
closely defined and adjusted to fit Serbian context, especially when discrepancies of
insurance requirements for consulting services and the rules of insurance companies are
taken into regard.

In significant number of cases it was noted that the contractor was delayed or did not
fully performed its obligations related to regular reporting and preparation of requested
documents. We learnt that in addition to better description of requirements in regards to
form and contents of the documents that represent the contractor’s obligation we should
also insist on better organization of the contractor’s technical and administration
departments.

We believe that regarding the environmental, social and traffic safety issues significant
improvements were also made by the Project implementation. Previous practice of the
contractors was that these areas were given a minimum of attention since they were
treated as not so important. Clear definition of requirements for environmental
monitoring, road and traffic safety with constant consideration of social welfare benefits,
instructed contractors to pay closer attention to these aspects and consequently improved
their performance in regards to these issues. The supervision also played a very important
role as besides testing of quality of the works they were also responsible for controlling
the implementation of the contractor’s mitigation measures and compliance with
safeguard policies and plans. In order to make additional improvement in this field, our
proposal would be for the contractor to have staff appointed exclusively for
environmental and social issues that would be present at the site, while the person
nominated for the traffic safety should have a more active role during the process of
construction. For the employer’s point of view introduction of penalties for the contractor
in case of contractor’s failure to comply with these specific requirements could be
introduced in order to force the contractor to pay closer attention to the mentioned areas.

The biggest problems during realization of contacts for rehabilitation works related to
quality of the design documents. In significant number of cases there were discrepancies

                                             52
of conditions stated by the design and the ones actually present in the field. As these
discrepancies were dominant for increase of costs beyond the contacted values and
extension of the contracted periods for the works, we learnt that it is necessary to improve
the process of preparation of designs as well as monitoring of this process. The contract
for designing should also include a provision that would oblige a designer to be available
during the works execution. Thus, the designer could assist and facilitate resolution of all
possible problematic issues in regards to implementation of design. The time between the
design preparation and works execution should not be long so that circumstances present
at the time of design preparation are not significantly changed by the time of
implementation of the works.

Upon the detailed analysis of all the road sections, upon the grouping of the problems, it
was concluded that timely implementation of the Road Safety Inspection will solve
majority of the problems. This means that RSI must become a necessary part of the
preliminary phase of the Project, in order to perceive all the problems regarding the
safety aspect. This is the only approach that could resolve problems in advance. Avoiding
solving the problems in the phase of exploitation, would mean traffic safety from the first
day of exploitation as well as saving the irrational expenditure of funds in this phase.

Special area of concern that should be addressed in future contracts is subcontracting as
in some of the cases under the TRP this was also a problem. Share of subcontracting of
the works should be better defined as well as stricter control on the site in order to avoid
problems present with contractors acting as managers.

Considering that under the TRP three contracts were terminated and significant amount
of time was lost for contract termination procedure and repeated procurement procedure,
in case when demanding contracts are present, better definition of triggers for termination
of contracts and clear definition of employer’s actions should be provided within the
bidding documents. Increase of value of performance security would be also a possible
measure to prevent the negative effects of contractor’s nonperformance on the employer.

The experience and knowledge gained during the preparation and implementation of the
Project will serve for future projects financed by the World Bank where some of the
mentioned experience has been already incorporated as suggested improvement of
standard bidding documents for the new project which is now in the preparation phase.

8.     Borrower and Bank Performance

Overall progress of the Project varied from moderately satisfactory to satisfactory where
the downgraded rating was precautionary as slight delays in regards to the original
implementation schedule happened, primarily reflecting changes in the Project
Coordinator, ongoing institutional reform of the SRD, limited capacities of PIT at that
time, as well as changes in the Government and delayed administration and bureaucracy
actions, financial crises and problematic business performance of contractors’ companies
due to insolvency, problems in privatization process, etc. It should be noted that from the
time of the Project preparation 5 Project Coordinators were appointed. From 2004 to

                                            53
2010 three formal replacements on this position were made. Additionally, during the
Project life there were 5 different Governments and as many Ministers of finance. All
these changes required the implementation of procedure for depot signature change
which always took a certain period of time.

The Borrower considers that the Bank performed very well throughout the period of the
Project. PIT staff in particular is very appreciative of the help, work and advice given to
them by the Bank’s staff during the implementation of the Project. The contribution and
work of Task Team Leaders, Mr. Cesar Queiroz, Mr. Martin Humphreys and Ms.
Svetlana Vukanović together with their teams and supervision missions have contributed
greatly to the final success and achievements of the Project.?
