                                      ANNEX 1:
                                   Proposed Changes

1.      The proposed project restructuring is needed to extend the project closing date
following a request from the Government of the Republic of Serbia received in a letter
dated October 10, 2011. With the proposed restructuring, the project closing date will be
extended from December 31, 2011 to June 15, 2012. The proposed restructuring does not
entail any changes to the project’s development objectives.

2.      An IDA Credit in the amount of US$55 million equivalent was approved by the
Bank for the Transport Rehabilitation Project on May 25, 2004. The original closing date
for the IDA Credit was December 31, 2008. On June 20, 2007, the Bank approved
additional financing for the Project in the amount of US$50 million through an IBRD
loan; the closing date for the IBRD loan was June 30, 2011 and the closing date for the
IDA Credit was extended to June 30, 2011. The IBRD closing date was extended once in
March 2010 to December 31, 2011, and a second extension is being requested in this
memorandum. The IDA Credit has closed.

3.      This request for an extension of five and a half months in the closing date of the
project reflects delays in project implementation resulting from the negative impacts of
the world economic crisis on the Serbian economy, and in particular on companies
engaged in construction and rehabilitation of roads. The insolvency of two contractors
working on the project and their inability to fulfill their contracted obligations, despite
meeting all required financial and technical requirements at the time of contract award,
led Public Enterprise Roads of Serbia (PEPS), the implementing agency for the project,
to terminate their contracts. A new contract was awarded on August 25, 2011 and the
civil works are progressing well. The civil works are expected to be completed by June
15, 2012.

4.     No changes have been made with regard to implementation agencies, there are no
outstanding audits, financial management reports are satisfactory, and the project is
progressing satisfactorily. The project’s objectives continue to be achievable within the
extended closing date period.        The performance of the borrower and project
implementing agencies continues to be satisfactory. Disbursements as of November 10,
2011 amounted to about 46 percent of the loan funds (US$ 22.83 million disbursed out of
US$ 50 million IBRD Loan).

5.     The proposed restructuring does not involve any other changes. However, the
disbursement projections will be updated to reflect the expected disbursement profile
agreed with the government, in which approximately 60 percent of the IBRD loan will be
disbursed by the end of 2011, and the rest by July 2012. The table below provides a
summary of the completed and the remaining civil works contracts, as well as the
forecast disbursements.
