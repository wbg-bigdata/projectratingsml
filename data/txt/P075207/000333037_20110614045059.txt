If, yes, please explain:

   income.

If, yes, please explain:
    All works for the proposed sections for rehabilitation will be done within the existing
    ROW. There will be no road widening outside the existing ROW, no changes of
    curvature etc. The sections do not encroach on any areas of cultural significance, or
    protected areas. The proposed changes are not expected to present any unusual or
    difficult environmental safeguard issues, and environmental management for this
    extension is entirely within the capacity of the PEPS organizational structure. The
    mitigation plan and monitoring plan will be similar to the current Environmental
    Management Plan.
