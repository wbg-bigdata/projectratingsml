                         Implementation Status Overview
                         PBS 2 was approved in 2009, for a total of USD 540 million. Additional financing of USD 420 million was approved in 2011. At this time the results framework was revised.

                         PBS is the major aid instrument supporting improved and more accountable decentralized basic services in Ethiopia. While significant gains were made under the PBS 1 period, the
                         gaps in service delivery remained large and development outcomes low. In addition, disparities persisted across gender, income groups, and regions. PBS 2 set out to sustain the
                         momentum built under PBS 1 and to support the expansion of service delivery and supplement it by improvements in the efficiency and quality of services. The PDO for PBS 2 is
                         similar as that for PBS 1, but with an emphasis on improving both access and quality of basic service delivery, in recognition that decentralized service delivery under PBS 1 and
                         before had been very successful in enhancing coverage and access, but should now work more with complementary sectoral operations to delve deeper into quality issues. The
                         objectives of the operation were highly consistent with the Bank country assistance strategy and with the development priorities of the Government. The relevance of PBS 2
                         objectives is assessed to be High.

                         PBS 2 was designed based on the implementation experience and lessons learned from PBS 1, building on the successful implementation of that program. In PBS 1, the block grants
                         contributed to the expansion in delivery of core basic services in education, health, agriculture and water/sanitation. Under PBS 2, the block grants component covered the same
                         basic sectors as in PBS 1, with the addition of rural roads. PBS 2 also supplemented the block grant with other high-impact pro-poor activities, including expansion of contraceptives
                         for women and intensification of the fight against malaria through the provision of critical health commodities to front-line service providers. To enhance citizen engagement and
                         oversight, PBS 2 focused on both the supply-side and demand-side of accountability around public budgets and services, catalyzing new levels of openness in the public budget
                         system and engagement between local councils and citizens.

                         For Sub Program A1, funding the Basic Services Block Grants, the basic structure from PBS 1 was continued under PBS 2, but with some important changes, including the “SAFE?
                         approach—Sustainability in additionality, Accountability including fairness, Fiduciary standards, and Effectiveness. The “SAFE? principles formed an overarching framework to assess
                         progress for all Sub-Programs under PBS 2. The results of the SAFE performance assessment of any year were a key basis for deciding on disbursements under Subprogram A for
                         the following year.

                         Lessons learned from PBS 1 were also incorporated into the other PBS 2 subprograms on capacity development and systems strengthening. The overall design features remained
                         similar to the first phase. Since, as anticipated, capacity constraints were evident in the decentralized delivery of services in the PBS 1 period, efforts to further develop capacity and
                         strengthen country systems were undertaken in PBS 2 for fiduciary aspects, and accountability and transparency activities under the FTA. Social Accountability continued efforts
                         started in PBS 1 and was designed flexibly to allow for decisions over the roll-out to be made following an external evaluation of the PBS 1 experience.

                         Through PBS 1, the program modality had proven to be an effective vehicle to highlight bottlenecks and policy issues related to decentralization, local level governance and service
                         delivery in Ethiopia. Thus, in the design of PBS 2, the DPs and Government decided that PBS should continue as a medium-term instrument in Ethiopia’s aid architecture, and that a
                         Sector Investment Loan (SIL) was the appropriate instrument. The SIL as deployed under PBS 1 had allowed significant flexibility to the Bank and its co-financiers in terms of
                         providing a financing vehicle where the level of disbursements can be adjusted subject to performance on agreed criteria. There was a question on whether a transition from SIL to
                         DPL should be considered for PBS 2. However, it was decided that the choice of a SIL was critical to supporting capacity building at the sub-national government (especially woreda)

                         level, particularly on PFM and transparency/accountability aspects. It also allowed the use of associated Bank fiduciary safeguards, which also facilitated co-financing from donors,
                         who strongly supported the use of a SIL for PBS 2. Further, a multi-sector SWAp was adopted, whereby existing sector coordination mechanisms and policy frameworks defined the
                         sub-programs supported under PBS 2, with activities and expenditures focused at sub-national levels. It was agreed that given the multi-sector SWAp nature of the PBS, as well as
                         its use of country systems for service delivery, financial management, etc., it should be regarded as a Program which contributes to the Government’s broader sector development
                         programs in the relevant sectors.

                         The Additional Financing in 2011 included no fundamental changes to the PBS 2 design and implementation approach, as the appropriateness and relevance of the objectives and
                         designed were reexamined. Rather, Additional Financing resources were sought to fill financing gaps in the Basic Service Block Grants Sub-program A1 and the Health MDGs
                         Support Facility Sub-program B. The additional financing further extended PBS 2 operation for one year, from December 31, 2011 to January 7, 2013, to allow for continued progress
                         on capacity-building sub-programs. As part of the continual effort to strengthen Monitoring and Evaluation Sub-program D, the DPs and Government also updated and revised the
                         Results Matrix. During this process, indicators were modified to align them with the IDA Core Indicators for the PBS sectors. Further, the results framework was aligned with the
                         Government targets for basic service delivery in the Growth and Transformation Plan. While the team felt that the new targets were ambitious, there were important advantages in

                         setting targets which were fully consistent with the Government’s Plan. Relevance of design is rated as High.

                         Efficiency: Throughout PBS 2, the Government has successfully met the SAFE principles, showing efficient and fair allocation of resources to basic service delivery. Overall, regional
                         governments have increased their allocations to the five basic service sectors: EFY2004 saw them spend almost 67 percent of their budgets on basic services, up from 63.5 percent

                         in EFY2003. The Government has also made significant progress in the capacity and system strengthening; for example shown in the timely submission of IFRs and QERs
                         throughout the project period. PBS 2 has provided a broad range of support to strengthen national systems for data collection, analysis, and strengthening data quality. It has also
                         supported the development of quality databases and information systems. The use of a SIL, as described above, provides a unique opportunity to achieve efficiency through
                         effectively combining finding for block grants with capacity development and systems strengthening. In addition, the program has allowed for important dialogue with the Government
                         on policy issues related to decentralization, service delivery, and macro environment, amongst others.

                         The economic and financial review of past PBS interventions undertaken as part of PBS 3 design, indicates that the program (i) generates good value-for-money; and (ii) has allowed
                         the expansion of basic services without endangering the sustainability of the macro framework. It concludes that PBS 1 and 2 have contributed to the substantial expansion of
                         decentralized basic services, and to the associated observed improvement in indicators in the targeted sectors. In turn, analyses by DfID (2011) and the EU (2012) indicate that PBS
                         has not only led to improvements in social indicators but also has done so in an operationally efficient and effective way. Since the expansion in the social sectors has been costly (on
                         average above 1.5 percent of GDP between 2006 and 2012), in the absence of concessional financing, this expansion would have been either difficult or have put significant fiscal
                         pressures on the country. Based on the overall high return to the investment, allowed through an instrument combining these three crucial aspects of service delivery support
                         (financing, capacity and systems strengthening and policy dialogue), efficiency is rated as Substantial.

                         Implementation: PBS 2 progress and implementation status has been reviewed through semi-annual Joint Review and Implementation Support (JRIS) missions, with participation
                         from all Development Partners, Government officials at federal, regional and woreda levels, civil society organization, and other stakeholders. These missions determine whether
                         government continues to meet its responsibilities under the SAFE principles ("Sustainability in Additionality", "Accountability and Fairness", "Fiduciary Standards", and
                         "Effectiveness") and allow for implementing agencies to provide an update on all aspects of implementation. The November 2012 JRIS rated the overall project progress as
                         satisfactory and concluded that the Government has fulfilled all the SAFE principles. This was the last JRIS mission for PBS 2, which closed on January 7, 2013.

                         Overall, PBS 2 has delivered impressive results and contributed to the strong overall progress in the basic services sectors in Ethiopia. Progress in the results indicators was
                         significant both before and after the results framework was revised during the design of additional financing in 2011. The appraisal mission for PBS 2 additional financing undertook a
                         comprehensive review of the PBS program performance, and in terms of progress towards Development Objectives and Implementation Progress, PBS 2 was rated Satisfactory. The
                         PBS 2 results are summarized below. Most of the figures presented in this ISR as of June 2012, which is the most recent data available.

                         Health: In the health sector, the Ethiopia Demographic and Health Survey shows that contraceptive prevalence increased to 29% from 15% between 2005 and 2010. The number of
                         children immunized jumped by almost 50% to 2.1million. Similarly, remarkable achievements were observed in the under-5 mortality rate, which declined from 123 (per 1000 live
                         births) in 2005 to 88 in 2010. The expansion of Health Extension Workers (HEW), who are financed via the PBS-funded block grants, to almost all kebeles in the country has
                         significantly contributed to these impacts. In 2010, over 63% of household had received basic health training from HEWs.

                         Education: PBS financing has also helped to hire more than 100,000 additional primary school teachers, which has been accompanied by impressive results – in grades 1-8 net

                         enrollments rose from 68.5% in 2004/05 to 85.3% in 2010/11, and primary school completion (grade 8) increased from 34% to 49.4%.

                         Agriculture: PBS has supported the agriculture sector through the hiring of more than 45,000 Development Agents (DAs), whose role is to provide agricultural extension services for
                         crops, livestock, and natural resources management, animal health professionals and cooperative promoters at the woreda and kebele levels.

                         Water and sanitation: As a complement to sector specific operations, PBS has supported an increase in the number of woreda-level water supply, sanitation and hygiene staff to
                         oversee local access and quality of water supply.

                         Roads: Through provision of recurrent budgets for local staff costs, the PBS program has supported the establishment of 500 woreda road desks that provide a platform for these
                         improved rural transport services.

                         Pilot Local Investment Grant (LIG): The objective of pilot LIG component was to increase the quantity and improve the quality of local-level capital investment consistent with the aim
                         of protecting and promoting delivery of basic services by sub-national governments while deepening transparency and local accountability in service delivery. The pilot LIG was
                         implemented in 99 woredas (51 in Phase I and 48 in Phase II) in the nine regions between 2008/09 and 2010/11. Through the Pilot, new national systems for local-level participatory
                         planning and budgeting, financial management and procurement, environmental and social impact screening, and monitoring and evaluation of capital projects were developed and

                         tested. Analysis of the expenditure data of the sample woredas, conducted as part of the LIG Evaluation in July 2011, showed that the share of capital expenditure in the total
                         expenditure of the woredas increased significantly from pre-LIG period to post-LIG period for all woredas. According to an assessment by a qualified engineer during the quarterly LIG
                         implementation supervision missions in 15 weredas, the technical quality of the LIG sub-projects was deemed to be satisfactory with an average rate of more than 80 percent.

                         Health component. Progress under sub-program B has continued throughout the project period, especially with regards to the important community-based health insurance pilot
                         program and the implementation of the Human Resource Policy and Learning Management Plan. Several health commodities have been procured and distributed through this sub-
                         program, including 4.2 million long-lasting insecticide treated bed nets; various types of essential drugs; 19.8 million doses of contraceptives (Implanon); and numerous vaccines and
                         syringes. Challenges were encountered in the Health Management Information System.

                         The capacity development aspects of the program have also delivered significant results. The Financial Transparency and Accountability activities have expanded significantly under
                         PBS 2. Since the last JRIS, a further 51,206 citizens have participated in the budget literacy training, bringing the total trained to 171,017. Approximately 92% of woredas now post
                         budget and expenditure data using customized templates. And almost half of all citizens reported they now have knowledge about their woreda’s budget, compared to less than one
                         out of ten before the Project’s start. In the Social Accountability sub-program, over fifty Ethiopian Civil Society Organizations, reflecting a good mix of PBS-supported sectors and
                         representing nine regions, were short-listed to receive funding under ESAP-2. With the funds available at this time, agreements have been signed with 30 CSOs for social
                         accountability work in 143 woredas.

                         Accomplishments in improving the quality of local public financial management systems have been significant. PBS 2 has supported a set of activities to strengthen local level
                         fiduciary and oversight capacity, rolling out of automated financial management software from regions to woredas, and financed activities to strengthen internal and external auditing,
                         cash management, budget and account reforms, federal and regional procurement system strengthening. A few examples of the system strengthening achieved by this component is
                         the following: simple and easy to use accounting and budgeting system is now running in over 1500 locations (up from less than 200 at the start of PBS 2), over 41,000 government
                         officials have been trained in various aspects of financial management against a target of 17,000 and hardware has been upgraded in all regions and in all 1000 woredas.

                         Sub-program D on Monitoring and Evaluation has supported the capacity to collect and use improved decentralized data. It has supported the introduction of a data quality
                         assessment framework and assessed the systems to collect results data. Further, it has supported improved management information systems for these sectors and conducted
                         targeted studies to investigate constraints to service delivery results. Completion of two Data Quality Assessment frameworks, in the roads and education sectors, as well as the
                         approval of the Ethiopian Data Quality Assessment Framework by the National Statistics Council were important achievements in strengthening the data quality. However, some
                         studies under sub-program D were not completed by the closure of PBS 2. These include a socio-economic survey, staff tracking assessments in the agriculture and education
                         sectors and facilities surveys in the health and education sectors. To improve implementation of these and other important studies in PBS 3, Government and Development Partners
                         agree there is need to improve engagement and ownership of across line ministries and strengthen procurement capacity in all implementing agencies.

                         While control of inflation is not an objective of the program, PBS has monitored the macro environment as part of its policy dialogue with the Government, given the importance

                         inflation has for the real size and impact of the block grants. The high inflation noted in the previous to JRIS mission has abated, as evidenced by a fall in the inflation rate to 15.8% in
                         October 2012. These persistently high levels of inflation, however, and low levels of foreign reserves must be continuously watched to ensure that the objective of maintaining high
                         economic growth in the longer term is achieved.

                         Government has made good progress in its efforts to restructure the Channel One Programs Coordinating Unit, which has resulted in improvements in the timeliness and quality in
                         the submission of government financial reports. These efforts will be further consolidated during the start-up of PBS 3.

                         Throughout PBS 2, the program has been a strong example of the development effectiveness principles outlined in the Paris, Accra and Busan agreements. The program has
                         enjoyed strong country ownership and alignment by supporting an existing and credible government program. Development Partner Funding complements Government resources for
                         the program, and PBS provides a forum and mechanism to bring together several donors' financial contributions to support overall program goals. Further, because Government and
                         DPs agree on the overall PBS objectives and jointly support them, PBS has provided a productive forum to discuss challenges and constraints to meeting those objectives. Because

                         most of the major donors to Ethiopia are PBS partners, PBS discussions are taken very seriously by DPs and the Government. PBS 2 has further demonstrated harmonization
                         through dedicated resources for coordination and streamlined donor processes through the PBS Secretariat. Beyond the Government and IDA, 10 other DPs have contributed to PBS
                         2.
