Recent Economic and Social performance
As a small island economy, Samoa's development is constrained by a very small internal market, distant external
markets, a narrow production base, high unit costs of infrastructure from low utilization rates, and vulnerability to
external economic shocks and natural disasters. The economy is dominated by its primary sectors (40% GDP), is
structurally narrow and heavily dependent on foreign aid flows (17% GDP) and remittances from expatriate Samoans
(20% GDP). GDP per capita in 1997 was $US1,150.
The Samoan economy has long been characterized by low productivity and low growth. Following the adverse
economic shocks of the early 1990s, including two severe cyclones, the taro leaf blight and financial crisis linked to
Polynesian Airlines, economic performance has improved considerably during the mid- 1990s. This reflects a recovery
in agricultural production, reconstruction of infrastructure following the cyclones, a rebounding of tourism, and a tight
fiscal stance. Real GDP increased by about 10 percent in 1995 and by a further 6 percent in 1996 to reach its pre-
cyclone level of 1989. The country now enjoys a healthy international reserve position, a moderate rate of inflation,
and a relatively stable exchange rate. Macroeconomic stability has been achieved, inter alia, through sharply shrinking
the fiscal deficit, rebuilding private sector confidence and maintaining political stability and continuity in Government
administration.
Samoa's 167,000 people are concentrated on two main islands, with 53 percent of the population living in small,
coastal villages. Their standard of living is relatively high and uniforrn, reflecting the Samoan commitment to
community and social institutions. Over the past several decades, Samoa has improved the health status of its
population by providing basic health services and has increased access to education.
In Samoa, as elsewhere in the Pacific, the indigenous culture and tradition are the fundamental parameters which guide
national life. While modified by historical and colonial experience, the traditions exert significant control over natural
resources and have profound influences on national policies. The chiefly matai (clan head) system controls all local
government and extends into high political offices. Over 80% of land is under matai control, sustaining nearly 70% of
the active population and about half of GDP. There are about 300 villages in Samoa, each with 20-40 matai
representing an extended family ('aiga) in the village council (fono). Matai titles are ranked, often superseding ranks in
the business or political domains and may, for example, dictate employment or other business obligations.
The overarching framework for economic and social development in Samoa is set by the Government's Statement of
Economic Strategy (SES). The Strategy, which was first announced in January 1996, is focussed on creating an
enabling environment for the private sector, liberalizing the financial sector, strengthening human resource
development and reforming the public sector. The SES has been updated on two occasions, with the 1998/99 SES
published in May 1998. Progress with the reform agenda has been significant. Fiscal and monetary policies have been
sound in recent years, leading to improved outcomes for inflation and the external position. Import tariffs and the tax
system have been rationalized and the financial sector liberalized. While a start has been made on public sector
reform, progress has been slower than envisaged.  The recent announcement by the Prime Minister of the

establishment of an independent National Reforn Commission, with a charter to bring a wider cross section of
government and civil society into the refonn process, will strengthen commitment to the reform agenda.
Comparative Advantage and Partnerships
The main sources of development financing for Samoa have been the Asian Development Bank, Japan, Australia and
New Zealand. This is not expected to change. The World Banks' program in Samoa has been relatively modest, with
Samoa receiving 10 IDA credits since 1975. The lending program has had a strong focus on the infrastructure sector,
specifically roads, power and telecommunications. Other sectors where the Bank has been involved includes
agriculture and the finance. The Bank's lending experience has generally been mixed, with institutional strengthening
aspects of a number of past projects proving problematical. This has been particularly so where inadequate account
was taken of the social and cultural setting or the project was based on an over-estimation of the capacity of agencies
to absorb institutional strengthening. In terms of non-lending services, the main focus has been on public sector
expenditure, health and education. The interventions in the health and education sectors have provided useful inputs to
the development of Government of Sarnoa strategies in those sectors. More recently the Bank has supported work
focussed on the social fabric of Samoa. A study of stakeholder participation has provided insight on the linkages
between the traditional, public and private sector domains and has provided important background for the preparation
of this project.

Project Appraisal Document                  Page 5                     Title: Infiastructure Asset Management Project
Country: Samoa
The strategy of the Bank in Samoa is to support the Government in its goal of achieving a more efficient and cost-
effective public sector and to develop stronger and more effective participation of the private sector and other
stakeholders in civil society. This will involve a continuing but modest level of lending focussed on key sectors,
supported by a continuing program of non-lending economic and sector analysis. Priority will be attached to donor
coordination and consultation.
The infrastructure sector has provided the core focus of Bank support for Samoa to-date. The Infrastructure Asset
Management Project builds on the successful experience of the Emergency Road Rehabilitation Project and will
maintain the Bank's involvement in this key sector. The economic and sector work undertaken in the health and
education sectors provides the basis for further Bank involvement. The Bank's priority of bringing broader civil
society into the development process means that it is well placed to respond to the Government of Samoa request to
assist in the establishment of the National Reform Commission.
The lending services will continue to be supported by a program of non-lending economic and sector work that will
expand on these themes. The non-lending services are flexible and remain responsive to the Government of Samoa's
reform program.
2. Main sector issues and Government strategy:
The SES has focused on improving the environment for private sector growth by reducing the size of the public sector,
downsizing government activities and transforming state-owned enterprises (SOEs). SOEs are a major drain on public
financial resources and since 1986, the Government has privatized or liquidated its equity holding in a large number of
enterprises. Its objective for the remaining SOEs is to secure progress towards more commercially-oriented and
financially viable operations. Infrastructure SOEs are prominent, including the Electric Power Corporation (EPC),
Airport Authority (SAA), Water Authority (SWA), and the Special Project Development Corporation (SPDC), none of
which is financially self-sufficient at present. The small domestic markets and limited scope for economies of scale
pose significant constraints on development and on market competition. Other support to private sector development
comes from financial sector liberalization, tariff review, outsourcing of government services, and stimulus to small
enterprises.
In addition, the Government has an active public sector reform program including: i) performance budgeting, adopted
in mid-1996, which requires departments to focus on, and be held accountable for, the outputs they produce; ii)
gradual devolution of financial control and personnel management to line departments as systems are put in place; iii)
decentralizing planning and policy formulation, by introducing strategic and corporate planning in line departments;
iv) requiring project appraisal, monitoring and evaluation of all public investments - additional external borrowing is
only to be incurred for capital investment projects which are clearly in line with national strategies, have been fully
appraised, are economically viable, and are sustainable in technical, human and financial resource terms; and v)
strengthening the information systems for performance and monitoring.
3. Sector issues to be addressed by the project and strategic choices:
Three priority areas were identified by the Government for attention: i) changing the delivery of public works and
infrastructure services to focus on managing assets, and ensuring economic appraisal of investments; ii) urgent
rehabilitation of the key international air transport infrastructure which is vital to the country's economy and in danger
of reaching marginal service standards; and iii) meeting priority needs of road safety, coastal protection and road
development. The issues in the three subsectors include the following:
a) Airport Infrastructure
Samoa's national income is highly dependent on international trade, remittances from overseas and aid flows.
Air services and supporting airport infrastructure are vital to these flows, especially for tourism. The major



Project Appraisal Document                  Page 6                     Title: Infrastructure Asset Management Project
Country: Samoa
international air service routes to Samoa are centered on Faleolo International Airport, which is operated and
managed by the SAA, a SOE that is required to be commercial oriented. However, given the technical need to
provide capacity for large jet aircraft but also the thin markets for air services to Samoa, Faleolo is a high fixed
cost asset with low utilization. The airport supports a major share of the country's economic activity yet is not
able to achieve full cost recovery from user charges alone at present traffic levels.
As an international airport, Faleolo is required to satisfy strict international safety standards, as set by the
International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO). Strict adherence to these standards is reinforced given
Samoa's exposure to adverse weather conditions, especially cyclones. The existing condition of the runway,
taxiway, apron, and emergency equipment indicates the need for timely rehabilitation and urgent replacement.
In addition, the existing terminal building performs unsatisfactorily; there is congestion, spillover airside and
landside, and severe limitations to increasing concession revenue. Addressing each of these issues involves a
combination of essential civil works, facility improvements and capacity building of the SAA. Not too
surprisingly, the SAA incurs financial losses. Establishing an appropriate approach to cost recovery is a key
policy and management issue. Present losses stem, in part, from Government intervention in the operations
and management of the SAA (for example, in constraining airport charges and in imposing requirements to
provide three small airports, largely as community services). An adequate degree of autonomy to enable the
SAA to pursue its commercial obligations is therefore an important institutional issue which also calls for early
attention. At the same time, there is scope for cost efficiencies in a number of areas. Improving the capacity of
the Authority, particularly in financial management, will assist improved cost recovery.
b) Road System Assets
The road infrastructure asset has been improved considerably by the donor-supported post-cyclone restoration
effort, which restored and upgraded the road system so that the peripheral road network is complete on both
main islands to all-weather paved standard, with key waterways and coastal protection now designed to handle
extreme storm events. However, bridges and geometric standards on other parts of the network have become
obsolete through age and traffic growth - a medium-term plan prepared by the 1996 PWD Institutional
Strengthening (PWDIS-2) study showed that 37% of the 373 km primary road and bridges required
improvement and a 3-year budget requirement of WST 27.6 m. The growth of motorized traffic is now high
at over 10 % p.a. and has doubled since 1989 to about 11,000 vehicles or 66 vehicle per 1000 population.
Consequently, this is a period of social adjustment from a predominantly non-motorized community-based
transport environment where the primary modes of transport are slow-moving village-enterprise bus services
and pedestrian traffic, to one with higher-speed modem vehicles that can be dangerous on narrow winding
roads designed for low speeds. An excellent road safety program has been initiated in response to the pilot
program  funded under the Emergency Project.  However, vehicle and driver registration records are
incomplete and inadequate for road transport administration and cost recovery. Also, PWD lacks a systematic
basis and the tools for monitoring road needs, evaluating options and priorities, and preparing either annual
programs or a medium-term plan based on economic need. Thus, the priorities are: i) to establish the basic
tools for road asset management for preparation of prioritized annual programs and monitoring system
performance, and ii) to establish a planning process for road development to extend access to rural areas and
tourist developments and improve capacity where and when warranted, with due attention to appropriate
design standards, and to social and environmental impacts.
c) Coastal Infrastructure
Samoa is subjected to frequent cyclones, and Cyclones Ofa and Val in 1990 and 1991, which were 50- and
100-year events, caused a total of $440 million of damages (four times the GDP) and 23 fatalities. Substantial
lengths of seawall, beach replenishment and water-crossings were constructed for coastal protection of road
assets and village property under the IDA and ADB funded cyclone restoration projects. This work has
continued recently under Government budget to protect some village communities at risk. Rock seawalls tend
to be preferred by communities for their perceived protection, but they have high physical and visual impact



Project Appraisal Document                  Page 7                    Title: Infrastructure Asset Management Project
County: Samoa
on the beach environment and can be counter-productive. Alternative 'soft' solutions of beach replenishment
had mixed performance under Cyclone Val but were not well established. While the seawalls afford basic
protection for a 10- or 20-year event, damnage will be sustained by some parts of the infrastructure, and could
be substantial in the case of still worse events. Normal coastal and waterway erosion also pose risks to
communities and infrastructure in the coastal zone. Activities such as local reclamation and wall construction,
sand-mining, discharge of water, etc. disturb natural currents and deposition processes, potentially exposing
parts of the coast to greater risk. Risk exposure will continue to rise if economic and social activities are
allowed to expand uncontrolled into areas subject to natural hazards. The strategic questions include: i) the
standard of protection which is economically and strategically justified; ii) the responsibilities for cost
recovery and physical management of the coastal protection infrastructure when the protected assets are both
public and private; iii) the mechanisms for controlling adverse land-use and construction activities; iv)
appropriate procedures for preservation of environmental assets, environmental management, and engineering;
and v) the consultative, participatory and institutional framework.
d) Institutional Strengthening of Infrastructure Asset Management
The delivery of public works for roads, coastal and other engineering works, as well as government building
services, has been undertaken almost entirely by the Public Works Department (PWD). The private sector for
engineering and construction is small, but participation has been increasing steadily over the past 5 years in
response to SES and under the IDA Emergency project. Still, with only a few domestic firms available, the
private sector is generally lacking in quality, skills and depth. With a thin market it has proven difficult to
retain good skills either in PWD or private sector, so resources are often drawn from the wider region. Two
previous institutional studies made for the Public Works Department (PWDIS-1, -2), analyzed the options for
reform of PWD and designed a program for implementing reform. The chosen plan retained PWD as a
government department initially, with substantial restructuring, privatization of non-core functions and assets,
transfer of staff to the private sector, and further increased outsourcing to the private sector, so that PWD is
transformed into a manager role with a strongly phased down provider role. Later, when the necessary
financial systems are in place and performance requirements are being met, the government would consider
the long-term preferred option for corporatizing PWD as a statutory authority. PWD are embarking on the
reform program through local resources and internal consultation. PWD needs the tools for its new role of
policy advice and asset management, e.g., a road asset management system, financial management systems,
and environmental management, and supporting guidance on the restructuring, re-skilling, change
management, and the privatization transactions. Asset management is the generic approach already applied
successfully for decision-support in the road sector and commercial business. The establishment of systematic
monitoring and evaluation of the performance and expenditure needs of all infrastructure assets in the country,
based on inventory data, will be a key factor to achieving the Government's goals of performance-oriented
business. In lands and environment, DLSE has a vital role in coastal and natural resource issues but suffers
from severely deteriorating institutional capacity. Some consideration has been given to separation of
conservation and regulatory roles, but review and identification of appropriate reform is needed.
C: Program and Project Description Summary
la. Program Description (see Annexes 1 and 11):
The national Infrastructure Asset Management Program (IAMP) will help change the role of govemment in the
delivery and management of infrastructure services in the three priority sub-sectors, namely air transport, road
transport and coastal protection, in line with the SES. It will also meet high priority physical investments in these sub-
sectors needed to support and protect national economic growth and quality of life. Since the pace and direction of
public sector reform in this traditionally large sector have significant social, financial and political implications, the
reforms need to be developed within the particular cultural context of Samoa and require progressive implementation
over a sufficient period of time to allow effective participation and consultation. The Program is scheduled for an 8-
year period, to be undertaken in two Phases of 3 and 5 years respectively.

Country: Samoa
The Government's Program is being administered through a multi-departmental IAMP Steering Committee established
in 1997. It is jointly supported by IDA for the full 8-year period through an Adaptable Program Loan, and by annual
grant funding from the Australian Agency for International Development (AusAID), which is specifically supporting
the institutional reform of the Public Works Department through the 3-year period of Phase 1 and tentatively for 2
years of Phase 2 (IAM-2). The New Zealand Overseas Development Administration (NZODA) which has previously
supported the Department of Lands, Survey and Environment (DLSE) is likely to provide some additional support for
DLSE institutional reform through parallel grant funding - while these activities will be directed by the IAMP Steering
Committee, the funds have not been directly incorporated in the Program scope. GoS will fund nearly half of the local
costs in the first phase, while it absorbs the revenue impacts of the major 1998 tariff reforms, and is expected to
finance full local costs in the second phase
IAMTP Phase 1 (3 years): Meeting Vital Priorities and Improving Management
a) Timely rehabilitation and upgrading of the Faleolo International Airport landside and airside infrastructure and
services to satisfy international safety and operational requirements for the next 15 years;
b) For road infrastructure, priority works including replacement of six vulnerable road bridges, and construction
of pedestrian facilities and safety improvements on the main road corridor (Apia-Faleolo).
c) In the coastal zone, the development and introduction of a strategy for participatory management of coastal
infrastructure (CIMS) integrating environmental and storm hazard considerations, priority investments in
coastal protection, and the updating of land information and maps;
d) Strengthening the management of infrastructure assets through: i) reforming the delivery of public works,
through the first major stage of restructuring and business improvements in PWD, increasing private sector
capacity and participation, introducing asset management and preparing medium-term investment plans; ii)
establishing protocols for asset and information management for government departments; iii) improvement of
road transport administration and continuing implementation of a comprehensive road safety program; iv)
evaluating reform options for the administration of lands and environment (DLSE); and v) improved business
practices in the SAA to advance towards substantial financial autonomy, and to manage airport assets and
services.
IAMP Phase 2 (5 years): Investing in Sustainable Growth and Protection:
a) Support for warranted priority development of the road network, consideration of environmental sustainability,
economic priority and social impact in appraisal of public expenditures, to meet priority needs for access and
economic development and to improve safety and operation of the main arterial road;
b) Extension of the coastal asset management strategy to the entire coastline, support priority protection
investments and support the reform action plan for DLSE; and
c) Consolidation and continuation of progressive reform of public works delivery, including commercialization
or privatization of appropriate aspects, performance-oriented management of all related infrastructure assets;
safer and more efficient road transport, implementation of new environmental management processes in public
and private sectors including new oversight role for DLSE; and improved financial sustainability of airport
operations and assets.

2. Key policy and institutional reforms supported by the project:
The project supports key policy and reform objectives of the Government's SES, specifically for the selected
infrastructure subsectors, e.g.:
public sector reform  - better-defining the role of public agencies (for PWD  and DLSE); continuing
government withdrawal from direct provision of goods and services; improving financial control and
accountability; introducing project appraisal, performance monitoring and evaluation.

County: Samoa
*  private sector development - increasing participation in delivery of infrastructure works and services;
strengthening private sector capacity;
* promoting cost recovery from users, and guiding SOE's towards financial autonomy (SAA)
3. Benefits and target population:
The benefits from the project will derive from its outcomes in four areas:
a)     Air transport services will operate under strengthened safety, improved reliability and efficiency, and
enhanced quality of service . The rehabilitation of the existing airport facilities, including the runway,
terminal and control tower, and a small increase in capacity and safety margins, will satisfy international safety
and performance standards for the next 10-15 years. This will permit full wide body jet operations (B 747 and
B767 aircraft) in emergency and peak traffic conditions, reduce the risk of closure and also provide for
development of future potential long haul services. Principal economic benefits will derive from increasing
volume of trade, and associated foreign exchange earnings, especially tourism. Improved business practices
and commercial orientation in the SAA including revised user charges and improved cost recovery will
promote efficiency and strengthen financial sustainability in the provision of airport services;
b)     There would be real resource savings (including foreign exchange) in total road transport costs
through reduction of life-cycle road infrastructure costs, reduction of accident costs, and lower road user costs.
Both roadside communities and road users would benefit from improved safety and constraint of the adverse
impacts of growing traffic volume, speed and emissions. Where road transport is provided by intermediate
service suppliers (public bus operators, taxis, freight hauliers), the user savings can be expected to be passed
on to the final users (passengers, shippers, businesses, government agencies) since the markets for road
services are quite competitive.
c)     Public and private assets in coastal hazard zones would have improved resilience to natural disasters,
through improved control of drainage and flooding, physical protection, or control of activities, which will
lessen the expected damage from events with a 10-yr. return frequency to non-critical levels, and from worse
events to restorable levels. An estimated 120 (40% of the 300) village communities which are in coastal
hazard zones will have lower risk to their livelihood and assets. Natural resources such as fish populations and
sand materials could return to sustainable levels with appropriate infrastructure design and management; and
d)     There would be general socioeconomic benefits and fiscal savings deriving from streamlined public
service, a strengthened and expanded private sector, increased community participation, and sustainable
management of, and investment in, infrastructure.
4. Institutional and implementation arrangements:
Implementation Period: The overall APL program extends over eight years, with the initial project implementation
period being three and a half years from Board presentation, covering January 1999 - June 2002.
Institutional Arrangements: Four agencies are involved in project implementation:
Oversight will be provided by the Treasury Department of the Ministry of Finance, which is the representative of the
Government of Samoa for the project. A Steering Committee was established by the government representatives
during project preparation and this will continue as the Program Steering Committee (IAM-PSC) during Project
execution to guide and monitor the progress of both Projects and the Program.

D.5  Business improvement of SAA         SAA
Coordination:  During project preparation, a consultant was employed to assist the Steering Committee and the
various agencies with coordination. This proved to be very successful, and the Government will establish a Project
Management Unit (PMU), reporting to the Program Steering Committee, to continue to assist with coordination during
project execution.
Implementation Arrangements
A Borrower's Project Implementation Plan was developed during project preparation. This is a comprehensive
document covering the implementation schedule and agencies responsible for each activity, procurement plan,
disbursement schedule, performance indicators and monitoring of the overall project. The final BPIP, as agreed at
negotiations, will be updated annually, although the implementation schedule will be updated quarterly.
Project Management: The PMU will be headed by the Project Manager (PM). SAA, PWD and DLSE will each
appoint a Project Component Manager (PCM) to manage activities under their respective components. The civil works
on the airport will be conducted under a partnership charter between the employer's representative (the SAA-PCM will
fill this role), the construction supervision consultant and the contractors. For the NCB civil works on roads, bridges,
traffic safety and coastal protection, the Director of Works is designated as "the Engineer" and the construction
supervision consultants as the "Engineer's Representative". The PMU will also be responsible for: i) ensuring that the
IDA procurement guidelines and rules are strictly followed throughout the project, to avoid misunderstandings, disputes
and possible mis-procurement; ii) monitoring and evaluation; iii) coordinating consultations, and providing public
information and liaison; and project accounting and reporting. In general, project management will be drawn from local
consultants with the aim of encouraging sustainable private sector partnerships and experience.
Civil Works: The airport services have been defined in detail, and began in February 1999 under retroactive financing.
The three-year programs of works on bridges, pedestrian facilities and coastal protection to be supported by 1AM-1
have been defined and design and procurement documents are under preparation for the first year. Subsequent annual
PWD programs of road, bridge, traffic safety, and coastal protection works will be defined by the asset management
programs to be implemented under the project. All road, bridge and coastal works are packaged for NCB to stimulate
and develop the domestic private sector.
Institutional Development: A major consulting assignment will assist the implementation of the PWD reform,
adoption of asset management, development of the private sector, and preparation of medium-term road plan. The
supply of hardware and software for the implementation of the asset management systems (RAMS and AIMS) will be
contracted separately. A separate international consulting assignment will provide services for developing the coastal
infrastructure management strategy, strengthening environmental management, and DLSE institutional development,
in conjunction with local firms for implementation. Smaller consulting services will help the TCB improve traffic

administration and extend implementation of the road safety action plan. Engineering and supervision services for the
.road and coastal works are packaged to stimulate the domestic private sector.
Mid-term Review: In addition to normal IDA supervision, a formal mid term review of the project will be carried out
after 18 months, about September 2000.
Accounting, Financial Management and Auditing
Under the oversight of Treasury, the PMU will operate a dedicated project accounting and reporting system. The
accounting system will be established prior to Credit effectiveness (see G. 1 Conditions), and it will be compatible with
the current financial management and accounting guidelines of Treasury and of IDA. However, it will not be eligible
for PMR-based disbursements initially and will be reviewed periodically with the aim of satisfying all PMR
requirements by June 2001, as set out in an action plan (agreed during negotiations). Based on the accounting review
study and discussions with Treasury, the Project accounting system has been defined (see Annex 13) and is being
installed during February 1999. Each IA-PCM will process invoices for certification by the responsible manager in the
IA, submit the original documents to the Project Accountant (PA) who will record and log the transaction in the
system, and pass it to Treasury for payment from the Special Account, budget account or by direct application to IDA
(for large transactions).   The accounting system will use customizable commercial software and the unique
procurement identification which relates each action to the Project design and to the specific contract. The system will
be designed to generate the monthly, quarterly and annual accounts statements in the formats required by IDA, for
inclusion in the monthly reports and quarterly Project Management Reports (PMRs). The PA will provide back-up
support to the PCM's and IA's to ensure smooth operation of the accounting and financial transactions. Treasury will
be responsible for operation and replenishment of the Special Accounts for the IDA Credit and AusAID Grant. The
annual project accounts will be audited in a timely fashion by independent auditors acceptable to IDA and furnished to
IDA in a certified copy no later than six months after the end of the fiscal year. The assessment of financial
management capabilities and details of the financial reporting framework are provided in Annex 13.
Monitoring and Evaluation
The IA-PCMs will be responsible for regular monitoring and reporting of key performance indicators, and evaluating
trends against the targets, in accordance with guidelines provided in the BPIP. The PMU will be responsible for
facilitating the monitoring process and for compiling and reporting performance indicators to the IAM-PSC and IDA at
least annually or as specified in the BPIP, in a format acceptable to IDA. The IAM-PSC, on behalf of GoS, will be
responsible for directing whatever actions are required for achieving compliance with performance targets of the
Project.
D: Project Rationale
1. Project alternatives considered and reasons for rejection:
The project provides an integrated, systematic and consistent approach to the provision and management of
infrastructure in three areas that are crucial to the economic and social well being of Samoans. A separate piecemeal
approach to each subsector was considered inefficient on development assistance grounds.
Institutional reform in the delivery of public works became a priority after the two IDA-funded PWD studies in 1995
and 1996 identified the need for PWD to focus on asset management and to involve the private sector in provision, in
line with the Government's Statement of Economic Strategy (1996). When AUSAID, who had funded PWD
strengthening efforts from 1990-96, was unable to do this due to funding changes, the Treasury requested IDA in 1997
to consider financing a broad program of infrastructure support, including the airport rehabilitation, part of the road
and bridge program, and the PWD reforms. Initial considerations included water supply and waste management,
however, these and urban development were to receive support from other donors. The focus on asset management

arose from Treasury's introduction in 1996 of output-based performance budgeting and the requirement for line
agencies to justify expenditures through appraisal, monitoring and evaluation. Coastal protection was added when it
was recognized that PWD and DLSE lacked the means for appraising the viable alternatives for the additional
protection being requested by coastal communities, while also preserving the natural environment. The scope was
restricted to primary transport (road networks and airports) and coastal infrastructure because of their crucial
contribution to economic resilience against the high exposure of the country to natural and economic shocks. In order
to allow the restructuring and reform of PWD and DLSE to evolve effectively and adjust to the social and economic
constraints of the very thin market, the original project period of 5 years was transformed to an 8-year adaptable
program.

3. Lessons learned and reflected in the project design:
Experience from the Emergency Road Rehabilitation Project showed: i) the crucial link of infrastructure to the
country's ability to respond to natural shocks, and the need for standards and management that are appropriate and
sustainable in the small economy; ii) an institutional environment that is responsive to improving business practices
and asset management; iii) that effective participation and growth of the private sector, in the thin market that exists,
could be developed through selective use of joint-venture arrangements, the use of small-to-moderate contract



Project Appraisal Document                  Page 14                    Title: Infrastructure Asset Management Project
Country: Samoa
packages, and training in procurement and contract procedures, attracting a combination of national and regional firms;
iv) the need to manage coastal hazards more strategically, with full involvement of local communities to find
protection solutions that harmonize with natural coastal processes and are socially and environmentally sustainable. A
few severe contractual problems that arose under the ADB Cyclone rehabilitation project and the co-financed Multi-
sector Project, show the importance of developing sound contract practices and control in the particular social and
political context of Samoa. The Multi-sector Project (involving roads, agriculture, industry and power), which had
mixed and partially unsatisfactory performance, showed that the aggregation of objectives for the purpose of fiscal or
lending efficiency could be carried too far, and that sound preparation, demonstrable economic viability, and effective
project supervision must be built into the project design.
These lessons are reflected in the project design by the selection of the infrastructure sector, the common element of
public asset ownership among the infrastructure subsectors, and the unifying themes of institutional reform, through
reducing the role of government in the provision of infrastructure, increasing private sector capacity, and adopting an
asset management approach. While there are four implementing agencies, the common element is the operating
relationships with PWD, which are being affected by the public sector reform program.
4. Indications of borrower commitment and ownership:
The Government has shown strong commitment to the project throughout preparation. They appointed a Steering
Committee, task teams for each component and a Preparation Coordinator, which actively prepared and developed the
content of the Project. Treasury allocated sufficient funding (WST 700,000) for project preparation beginning Jan.
1998 as a priority over other urgent needs. Treasury worked effectively to resolve institutional issues as they arose
during preparation, and much of the leadership for the reform is now coming from within PWD and the Ministry. The
Cabinet enacted tariff revisions for the Samoa Airport Authority in July 1998 which already achieve a large part of the
cost recovery objectives identified for the project and have promised more when implementation of the airport
component begins.
5. Value added of Bank support in this project:
Continuity of Bank support, together with AusAID (who have supported PWD much in the past) for the reform of
PWD and the development of private sector capacity in infrastructure is likely to be crucial to sustainability, where
other donor-supported efforts (in power, water, etc.) have been transient with mixed results. The Bank has established
experience and technical leadership in the region for road asset management and knowledge management which will
ensure that the systems implemented will be appropriate and sustainable in a small administration, and integrated
effectively across subsectors.
E: Summary Project Analysis (Detailed assessments are in the project file, see Annex 8)
1. Economic (supported by Annex 4):
[X] Cost-Benefit Analysis:       []Cost Effectiveness Analysis:
[X] Other
Cost-benefit analysis is applicable to the roads/ bridges and coastal protection works components of the project.
Specific sub-projects for these components will be proposed by GoS during each phase of the project.
Road Assets: For bridge replacement works, the cost-benefit analysis evaluated savings deriving from removal of
load restrictions, accident reduction, elimination of delays through the widening from one- to two-lane capacity, and
avoiding the need for detour due to closure of the bridge at the end of its structural life. The benefit:cost ratio of the
bridge works averages 13 and ranges from 4.6 to 64. For the road safety and pedestrian facilities works, the cost-
benefit analysis assesses the expected savings deriving from reduction in accidents, fatalities and injuries, and
evaluates switching values of these savings relative to the cost of works. The proposed program is justified based on
expected accident savings alone, as the switching value at which schemes would become uneconomic is a low value of



Project Appraisal Document                  Page 15                   Title: Infiastructure Asset Management Project
Country: Samoa
WST 7,800 (USD 2,600) per statistical accident. The proposed program has a benefit:cost ratio conservatively
estimated of at least 13. Cost-benefit analyses of specific road sub-project proposals for IAM-2 will be a product of
the National Road Planning Study as well as a proposed specific feasibility study of road upgrading for the Apia-
Faleolo Airport West Coast Road.
Coastal Infrastructure: Major coastal protection works will be assessed along largely conventional cost benefit lines.
However, the probabilistic nature of the "hazard events" (mainly cyclones), poses some difficult empirical problems.
The methodology calls for balancing the capital (and maintenance) costs of alternative protection works against the
expected related savings in asset loss from exposure to various severe weather events. The use of customary land,
including reclaimed land, introduces complicating factors involving potential externalities and moral hazard.
Outcomes, and net benefits, will hinge on community consultation, participation and cost responsibility. Potential
options may include no protection works, and in other locations, control of land use and in particular, restrictions on
private/village development. Experience in other countries of applying cost-benefit analysis to coastal protection,
similar to the Samoan context, appear very limited. Accordingly, the methodology breaks new ground and, while
innovative, it should be seen as preliminary and subject to further refinement during the course of the Program.
A combined technical-economic analysis was made for two pilot sites proposed for Phase I of the Program (see Annex
4). These results indicate that "Improved Protection" is warranted at both the Fagili'i and Faga sites, as it yields a
positive net present value of WST 2.28 million and WST 0.338 million respectively, at these sites (the corresponding
IRRs are 132 per cent and 25 per cent, respectively). These results are most sensitive to the lowest intensity cyclone
(high frequency) for which "damage vulnerability" becomes negligible. (A ten year return period was adopted,
however a 15 year return period in both cases drops the NPV to a negative level.) This indicates the need for more
technical work on establishing "tight" estimates of this factor. The pilot analysis applied omits some benefits and costs
- savings from prevention of disruption to road traffic and other public and private services/activities, and the cost of
"disturbing" the amenity value of the natural coastline. Approaches to valuation of these other aspects will be
developed as the CIMS and its evaluation is progressed beyond this preliminary stage during Phase 1.
Airport: Conventional cost-benefit analysis of alternative designs is not directly applicable to the airport component,
although there are some aspects where benefit-cost trade-offs are assessed or least cost solutions used (see Annex 4).
Airports, overall, and the individual facilities and equipment at airports, are subject to strict safety and technical
standards, governed by international and individual country aviation authorities. These standards basically operate as
constraints and are paramount in airport facility design , for example, runways, aprons, emergency equipment and air
traffic control. While there are different levels (categories) of airport operation associated with these standards, the
range of choice of "standard" may be very limited on technical if not economic grounds; given its location as a remote
island in the South Pacific, this is the case in Samoa.
2. Financial (see Annex-4 & 5):
Samoa has very recently reduced and harmonized the levels and structure of its tariffs and other taxes. Based on these
changes, the Samoan Treasury advice is that the average conversion factor to estimate project economic costs from
financial costs is 0.85. The overall Financing Plan for the project is set out under Project Financing Data on the cover
page. Of the total project cost of US$18.8 million (including taxes and contingencies), US$3.1 million or 17% will be
funded by GOS (including estimated taxes amounting to US$2.4 million), US$14.4 million or 76% will be financed by
the IDA Credit, and US$1.3 million, or 7 %, by grant funding from AusAID. It is estimated that the IDA Credit will
finance approximately 56 % of local costs, which total about US$8.1 million.
While there are no user fees specifically related to the project components, direct user charges in the form of aircraft
landing and related charges, airport building rentals, and passenger departure fees, apply to use of the airport facilities
as a whole and these revenues will be used by the SAA to repay the lending from Treasury for the airport component
(at a total cost of US$7.4 million).



Project Appraisal Document                  Page 16                    Title: Infrastructure Asset Management Project
Country: Samoa
The recommendations of a recent review of airport fees and charges have been accepted by the Government, with the
exception of an increase in the passenger departure fee (from WST20 to WST30). However, Government has
indicated its willingness to also adopt this increase, once work on the airport terminal building starts. The airport is a
relatively high fixed cost asset with low utilization, and full cost recovery from user charges can only be approached in
the medium term (see Annex 4). However, with modest traffic growth (5% p.a.), and by implementing a number of
cost reductions, the SAA should be able to fully cover the annual loan repayments (WST3.6 million p.a.), beginning in
FY 2004. Overall accounting profits of the SAA are estimated to become positive in FY 2010.
User charges associated with the road/bridges component (fuel tax, vehicle registration fees, driver licenses) will be
subject to further review and addressed under Phase 2. For coastal protection, the case for, and feasibility of, select
user charges will be explored within the project.
Fiscal impact:
The impact of the project on government income/receipts is expected to be small. (Of course, continued growth of
airport activity and visitor expenditures will expand VAT revenues.) The impact of the project on govemment
expenditure is relatively modest: Cost recovery for the airport component is within the range of the recommended
(and already, in part, adopted) fee increases, including an allowance for maintenance. The net additional long term
capital and maintenance costs of the road/bridge and coastal protection works will require accommodation within the
existing government budget envelope.
3. Technical:
Studies of the technical requirement/options, existing condition, forecasted demand and physical setting have been
carried out during preparation. The most important of these are:
Airport Component           - ICAO Safety Audit
- Review of Terminal Building Rehabilitation (Chapter
8 of SAAFIA report)
Roads and Bridges Component  - Recent capital plan, and PWD Institutional
Strengthening Study, Phase II.
Coastal Protection Works  I- Coastal Hazard Mapping
The ICAO Safety Audit of Faleolo International Airport established a set of recommended actions associated with
intemational safety standards for the operations involved at Faleolo, currently and forecasted over the next 10-15
years. All outstanding recommendations that were assigned a "high priority" status by ICAO have been incorporated
into the project. These include runway, taxiway, and apron overlay with small capacity extensions, a new control
tower/fire station and new fire tenders.  The Review of the termninal building development re-examined the
recommendations of a study of the Faleolo International Airport Terminal undertaken in 1994. By and large, this
Review endorsed the earlier recommendations, which were based on reconfiguration/ refurbishment of the existing
terminal structure to improve performance of passenger, baggage, and air freight processing. Some minor changes that
were recommended by the Review related to staging options for redevelopment and floor space allocations for some
activities. These two technical studies supported the terms of reference for the engineering design for the proposed
airfield, equipment, and terminal works. Detailed engineering and stakeholder consultation are bein g conducted under
retroactive financing.
4. Institutional:
a) Executing agencies: The Treasury and PWD have previous experience in implementing IDA-financed
projects, and during project preparation have become conversant with current procurement procedures with the
PPF. Both have little spare staff capacity for additional responsibilities - which contributed to some execution
delays in the latter stages of the previous project - so establishment of the PMIU is crucial to smooth
implementation. The SAA and DLSE, which have not had previous experience with IDA, have become



Project Appraisal Document                Page 17                  Title: Infrastructure Asset Management Project
Country: Samoa
familiar with IDA procedures during preparation and will be fully supported by the PMU. While accounting
procedures are being strengthened in Treasury (under AusAID funding) and PWD have a costing system from
previous AusAID assistance, there remain inadequacies in financial management. Financial management and
other business processes will be strengthened in both PWD and SAA under IAM-1, while accounting for the
Project will be interfaced but separate (see Annex 13). The evolution of PWD from a provider role to asset
manager under the restructuring will be supported by a substantial program of works and services contracted to
the private sector which PWD will manage and thus develop a sustainable capacity for technical management.
b)  Project management:  The three tier structure of project management functioned well during project
preparation and greatly contributed to ownership and input by all executing agencies. However, for
implementation, the project manager has to have a stronger role than coordination, with responsibility on
behalf of the Program Steering Committee (IAM-PSC) for maintaining compliance with all implementation,
legal, financial and technical requirements of the project. Accordingly, the PMU will be responsible to the
IAM-PSC for giving direction and support as necessary to the PCMs in the various implementing agencies.
With the support of appropriate information technology being provided under the Project, these arrangements
are considered fully adequate for ensuring smooth implementation of the Project and Program.
5. Social:
Since Samoa's population comprises almost entirely indigenous people, OD 4.20 applies to the entire project. As per
policy recommendations, an initial social assessment was made to identify the pertinent social and cultural issues to be
taken into account. Subsequent social analyses as required will accompany individual components throughout the life
of the project. The initial social assessment also provides a framework for the participatory approach and consultative
framework which will be in place throughout the project. In this project, there is no resettlement and no expected land
acquisition. Since the cultural context has such a dominant influence on the approach to achieving the Project
objectives, salient aspects are summarized here.
Civil Society:  In Samoa, as elsewhere in the Pacific, the indigenous culture and tradition are the fundamental
parameters which guide national life. While modified by historical and colonial experience, the traditions exert
significant control over natural resources and have profound influences on national policies. The chiefly matai (clan
head) system controls all local government and extends into high political offices. Over 80% of land is undermatai
control, sustaining nearly 70% of the active population and about half of GDP. There are about 300 villages in Samoa,
each with 20-40 matai each representing an extended family ('aiga) in the village council (fono). Matai titles are
ranked, often superseding ranks in the business or political domains and may, for example, dictate employment or
other business obligations. All disputes over both land andmatai titles are handled by the Lands and Titles court. The
village fono has jurisdiction over the use of customary land and most aspects of village life and some functions, such
as sanitation and water, are delegated to the women's committee. Thus, the development of a coastal zone
infrastructure strategy involving controls over land use and economic assets must involve the villagefonos who would
administer it in the first instance at the local level. Thefono is also the key to disputes over land acquisition and some
locations have been disputed for generations.
Modem Samoan society reflects overlapping sociopolitical "domains'", in which socioeconomic status, especially
formal education and employment, cuts across political, administrative, private and traditional domains. Alongside
private enterprise, there is a particularly active "traditional enterprise" comprising economic activities supporting the
well-being and reputation of extended families, churches, villages and chiefs - these comprise significant resources,
provide primary social integration, and are embodied in the national constitution. The business and political domains
have a rich blend with the traditional domain which is continually evolving, andfa'a Samoa, the Samoan way of life,
permeates all activities with pride. The highly educated level of key middle and senior civil servants is also conferring
a progressive spirit to government in Samoa which is reflected in its active reform strategy and economic growth. An
emigrant population in the Pacific Rim totaling at least 60% of the domiciled population of 160,000 is a major and

Country: Samoa
crucial source of social support and revenue through remittances, and VFR travel comprises about 30% of international
travel.
Social Impacts: The primary social impacts of the project components are:
a) Airport - mainly positive, through better terminal facilities with comfortable space for the large family
groups that usually attend arrivals and departures of VFR travelers, a traditional cultural theme reflecting
national styles, and international standard processing performance; and marginal change in noise level from
lengthening of runway has negligible adverse impact on the nearest dwelling 150 m laterally distant.
b) Road - the road safety program aims to reduce accidents and fatalities by one-third to regional comparator
levels despite traffic growth of about 10-12% annually. The past rise in accidents to 23 fatalities in 1995, of
which 70% pedestrian and 50% children, was stemmed by the initial program 1996-97 and the impact on
children was halved. The potential impacts of PWD's proposed future road development program will be
studied under IAM- 1, comprising improved access for the rural poor and minor possible resettlement.
c) Coastal - the potentially significant social impacts of rock seawall structures on access to and use of beach
areas appear to be outweighed by the desire for protection from storm damage and natural erosion in the minds
of the village councils. The success of achieving 'soft' natural solutions instead of 'hard' will depend crucially
on the consultative process and participation of village council and women's groups.
d) Institutional - primary impacts are the employment-related effects of reform in, first, PWD which has a
large 'casual' labor force of about 360 and, second, DLSE later under IAM-2. The original proposals of the
PWD-IS2 which called for substantial downsizing have been shelved in favor of restructuring without
redundancy, but the broader prospect of a shift from public to private sector employment needs to be
assimilated by agency staff and the considerable extended families that they help support. In the absence of
official policies for redundancy and pension, PWD needs to pioneer means of handling the staff who leave
voluntarily for the private sector, and focus on re-skilling those staff who will form the residual business units
and those senior staff who assume new roles as asset managers. A highly participatory approach has already
been adopted, and also is proposed to be followed for DLSE.
6 Environmental assessment:  Environmental Category    [ ] A   [X] B  [] C
The first phase project, IAM-1, is expected to have no significant impacts on the environment and involves no
resettlement. The minor and moderate impacts potentially associated with civil works on the airport, road, bridge and
coastal protection components are expected to be appropriately mitigated through the application of standard operating
procedures from the Code of Environmental Practice. However, this is not yet in place and thus the endorsement by
DLSE and PWD of a Code of Environmental Practice (COEP) for civil works, acceptable to the Association, is
required during the first year, by September 30, 1999. The rating of Environmental Category B has been confirmed on
this basis.
In compliance with requirements for IDA-financed projects, a Project Environmental Analysis (EA) was conducted
(see Summary in Annex 12) The key elements include:
a) The most important environmental issues are associated with the development of a coastal infrastructure
management strategy (CIMS). Local CIM Plans (CIMP) will aim for appropriate control over damaging
activities such as sand-mining, private construction of coastal structures such as jetties, protective walls and
reclamation, changes to drainage and flood systems, disturbance of coastal ecosystems such as mangroves, etc.
and to preserve natural coastal processes as much as possible. A fully participatory approach is planned which
is essential because of the complexity of the institutional setting. The village councils have a high degree of
autonomy, and DLSE at present has limited powers in relation to environmental impact assessment (EIA) and
mitigation pending enactment of the draft EIA regulations of 1998. The provision of works is made by either



Proiect Appraisal Document                  Page 19                   Title: Infrastructure Asset Management Project
Country: Samoa
PWD under GoS budget or a private contractor. Detailed guidance, education and training to communities and
private sector firms on EIA, evaluation of alternatives, design, construction and monitoring will be provided in
through Coastal and Environmental services. A Coastal Infrastructure Management Guide (CIMG) to be
prepared and applied under the Project.
b) Generic issues on environmental management are being addressed for IAM- 1 through: i) requiring the
draft Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA) regulations to be mandatory for Project activities, and assisting
DLSE administer that; and ii) the adoption and application of Codes of Environmental Practice (COEPs) for
civil works by PWD and DLSE. The COEPs will be compatible with the DLSE draft environmental
regulations, and are intended to improve the standard operating procedures of both public and private agencies
in respect of mitigating environmental damage in planning, design and construction activities. They will be
mandatory for all civil works financed by the Project, and an action extending their use to all works
implemented by or through PWD will also be required during the project. The COEPs are expected to be
prepared by July 1999 (based on successful similar work in Fiji) for clearance with IDA and endorsement by
DLSE.
c) Specific works under the project which will require EIA clearance by DLSE and IDA before bidding
include:  i) Faleolo International Airport rehabilitation, specifically  seawall construction, drainage
improvement, and fuel spillage aspects; and ii) coastal protection works at Fagali'i and Faga. These
requirements are being incorporated into the scope of engineering services in each case.
7. Participatory approach [key stakeholders, how involved, and what they have influenced; ifparticipatory approach
not used, describe why not applicable]:
a) Primary beneficiaries and other affected groups:
The beneficiaries of the airport works - passengers, greeters, air cargo shippers, airlines and concessionaires -
were consulted during a 1995 preparatory study, shippers and airlines were consulted during project
preparation, and all stakeholders are being consulted through public meetings during the design and
implementation phases. The beneficiaries of the road, bridge and safety investments - the traveling public,
agricultural and industrial producers, consumers and local communities - have representation on the Transport
Control Board, and local communities participate directly in the safety awareness programs which provide
feedback on program effectiveness. The beneficiaries of the coastal protection works - village communities -
were broadly consulted during preparation of the coastal component, and will participate centrally in the
consultative framework that will be established around the villagefono as part of the CIMS. An overall
participatory and consultative framework for project implementation has been established through the social
assessment study.
PWD employees have participated since late 1997 in a series of day-long workshops (severally for senior
managers, supervisors, and permanent and casual staff) to discuss and provide input to the proposal and
options for reform of PWD business, and were previously consulted during the development of the present
restructuring plan.  Likewise, private sector groups (contractors, suppliers and professional engineers)
participated in, and were consulted through, a workshop in July 1998.
b) Other key stakeholders:
For institutional reform: the relevant government agencies and Ministers , including the Cabinet, Public
Service Commission, Treasury Departnent, Minister of Works, and Minister of Lands, Survey and
Environment have reviewed stage proposals and will authorize key steps, so must be continually informed and
involved during implementation. For coastal strategy, the villagefonos and komitis and the Ministry of
Internal Affairs, will participate through consultations that are part of the traditional council processes to

ensure sustainability. For aviation matters, the Minister of Transport was consulted continually during
preparation.
F. Sustainability and Risks
1. Sustainability:
Capacity-building for improved systematic management of key infrastructure assets (airports, roads and bridges,
coastal protection structures) is the core institutional component of the project. For each sub-sector, the key project
provisions determining sustainability are as follows:
Airport infrastructure: (i) improved business planning and financial management; (ii) partnership with a world-class
aviation authority; and (iii) GoS recognition of the importance of corporate autonomy and commercial orientation to
the financial sustainability of the SAA. As part of the business plan, a facilities management system would be
introduced later in this, or a subsequent, phase to maintain all airport assets in a sustainable condition.
Road System Infrastructure: (i) restructured focus of PWD on core functions of policy advice and asset management;
(ii) improved business processes and re-skilling of PWD staff; (iii) adoption of systematic road asset management,
with resultant quantitative basis for annual budget allocation and work prioritization and systematic evaluation of asset
condition and level of service; and (iv) sustained participation of the domestic private sector and openness to regional
competition.
Coastal Infrastructure: (i) the updated mapping information will provide an accurate basis for valuing assets at risk,
and for the long-term monitoring of physical changes and effectiveness of CIM strategy; (ii) conservation of the
natural shoreline environment will be dependent on the acceptance and appropriate application of soft solutions for
coastal protection where appropriate under the CIMPs, and on environmental management exercised by community
citizens; (iii) the sustained protection of public and private assets in the coastal hazard zones will depend on the
success in motivating the traditional leaders and private contractors to control land uses in some hazard zones in
accordance with the CIMS, and on constructing protective structures only in accordance with the CIMPs; and (iv) a
considerable extent of the coastline, including the most vulnerable areas, is already protected for a 20-year storm
through previous investments and aid. Sustainability is thus critically dependent on successfully modifying the
behavior of local leaders, citizens and contractors through consultation and participation based on the CIMS and
CIMPs.
Capacity-building: In the delivery of public works, on (i) the considerable progress already made in private sector
participation (30%) and active consultation of staff and stakeholders on the reformn process; (ii) the reform-oriented
present leadership of PWD, and progressive support under subsequent phases of the IAM Program; (iii) strategic GoS
support for public sector reform; and (iv) the readjustment in Phase I which slows the pace of reform in PWD to allow
further development of support from key stakeholders in GoS.

Project Appraisal Document                Page 32                  Title: Infrastructure Asset Management Project
Country: Samoa
Annex 2: Project Description
Component A: International Airport Infrastructure - US$7.4 million (total cost of component)
OUTPUTA: Capacity for safe handling of international air traffic increased and SAA financial viability improved.
This component, utilizing 41 % of the Project resources, will focus on upgrading Faleolo International Airport to have
adequate capacity for the next 15 years and to meet all applicable ICAO standards, some of which are increasing in
2000. The timing is dictated by the need for rehabilitation of the runway pavement, obsolescence of the emergency
equipment, and inefficiencies in the operation of the terminal and control tower facilities. GoS wishes the upgrading to
be complete in time for the 'millennium' celebrations in December 1999 since Samoa will be the last country to see the
New Year. The investments comprise the following four subcomponents:
Al. Rehabilitation and extension of the runway, taxiway and apron, lights, drainage, seawall ($2.84 m total cost):
The existing 2,700 m long runway will be resurfaced with hot-mixed asphalt, and extended by 300 m to the east to
improve landing in adverse weather conditions and allow an additional 5-12 tons payload - this is over an existing
paved stopping area that requires strengthening and surfacing. As intense tropical rainfall and wind-shear conditions
occasionally occur during the wet season, the new asphalt surface will be grooved to increase skid resistance.
Navigational lighting must be extended and recabled. Surface drainage at the eastern end will be improved, including
repair of a broken outlet to the sea. The rock seawall protecting the eastern end, damaged during the 1990-91
Cyclones, will be repaired. An additional taxiway will be built to the east to allow entrance from the runway extension
and allow free movement when more than one wide-body jet is at the terminal. The parking apron will be extended to
permit servicing of three aircraft (two wide-body B-747/B-767/DC- 10, and one B-737).
A2. Improvement of terminal building, and new fire-station and control tower facilities ($2.53 total cost): The
existing terminal building, built in 1987 is inefficient in its handling of baggage and passenger processing, especially at
peak periods, and has very poor amenity value. The interior will be redesigned to provide cover for baggage handling,
free-flow of processing, improved greeting space (which is a cultural priority) and marked with cultural motif to
engender national pride - the Level of Service will be raised from IATA Level D-E to Level C. The control tower,
which was too low to see the west end of the runway, will be raised and relocated outside the total runway strip width
for obstacle clearance in conformity with ICAO recommendations. Most probably, it will be combined with a larger
garage facility to house the new emergency fire equipment although the design will also consider separating the two
facilities. An EC grant is supplying USD 1.02 million worth of new traffic control equipment due to be delivered late
in 1999, including replacement VHF communications, VOR transmitter, tower refurbishment, hand-baggage X-ray
machines, rescue boats (2), runway and approach lighting, and other communication and computer equipment.
A3. Supply of two fire emergency vehicles ($1.38 m total cost): The two existing vehicles are 22 and 25 years old,
mechanically unreliable and very difficult to service. The new vehicles will be procured together to capitalize on
efficient service. The garage facility needs to be enlarged and relocated, as noted in A2.
A4. Engineering and architectural services for design and construction supervision ($0.75 m total cost): One
contract is being let for the engineering and architectural design and construction supervision. Initially, a design-build
option was considered for the pavement works which are relatively straight-forward. However, the combination of
services required for the whole component and the pressure to achieve the completion schedule led to the selection of
operation under a partnership charter. A partnering charter, pioneered in New Zealand and UK, is an agreement
between the contracting parties - engineer, contractors and client - which is intended to minimize disputes and lead to
optimal execution of the contracts. The services have been procured under advance procurement, and mobilized in
early February 1999, with the aim of awarding the works contracts by July 1999.

Country: Samoa
Component B - Road.System Infrastructure: -US$4.7 million (total cost of component)
OUTPUTB:  Reliability and safety of road system assets is improved
As considerable investnent in the road system was made through the previous IDA and ADB emergency projects, the
primary road system is in reasonably good physical condition. Emerging capacity and access issues will be addressed
in the second phase, IAM-2. This first phase concentrates on replacement of obsolete bridges, providing facilities for
the extensive amount of pedestrian traffic, and improving road safety blackspots, as follows:
B 1. Bridge rehabilitation and replacement ($3.15 m total cost): Six bridges, ranging in age from 29 to over 60 years
and all either single or one-and-a-half lane width, have been selected from the five-year replacement plan because they
are vulnerable to storm and truck damage (see Annex 4, Table A4-2 for details), i.e.:
*     B1.01      Tua'efu bridge
*     B1.02      Lelata bridge
*     B1.03      Saleia bridge
*     B1.04      Falevao bridge
*     B 1.05     Fagali'i ford replaced by bridge
*      B31.06    Falefa bridge
One, Saleia Bridge, was washed out in 1997 and the others are severely deteriorated with between 0 and 10 years of
remaining life. Replacement raises all these to two-lane and full-load standard with pedestrian facility. As a means of
developing the capacity of the domestic private sector, the design and supervision of the bridge works will be handled
through separate design contracts for each bridge, supervision contracts for each pair of bridges, and separate works
contracts for each bridge. Quality assurance will be provided through PWD and the PWD institutional consultants.
B2. Road rehabilitation ($1.30 m total cost): Localized rehabilitation and road safety improvements will be designed
and implemented for some key blackspot areas on the Apia-Faleolo West Coast Road corridor. These will comprise
construction of traffic calming zones, widened surface to separate traffic and pedestrian flows, and increased safety
markings and lighting.
B3. Road safety and pedestrian facilities ($0.25 m total cost): As the level of motorization is still low, and social
activity focuses around village settlements, there are substantial levels of pedestrian traffic. On the urban roads in
Apia, pedestrian traffic is concentrated around school, hospital and market areas, and some of these have significant
accident levels. Out of a larger program of 16 km of footpath construction, PWD has selected a priority program of
4.7 km of footpaths in either concrete or gravel surface construction at four locations (see Annex 4, Table A4-3 for
details), i.e.:
*     B3.01      Beach Road, 1,000 m.
*      B3.02     Lelata-National University of Samoa (NUS), 1,700 m.
*      B3.03     Convent Street, 700 m.
*     B3.04      Fugalei Street, 2,300 m.
It is intended to combine the paths with traffic calming measures to create distinctive safe environments for the
interaction of motorized and pedestrian traffic, and thus to introduce new pattems of driver and pedestrian behavior to
urban road traffic. The works will be designed and supervised by a local consultant.



Project Appraisal Document                Page 34                  Title: Infrastructure Asset Management Project
Country: Samoa
Component C: Coastal Infrastructure: --- US$2.3 million (total cost of component)
OUTPUT C:  Environmentally and socially sustainable management of coastal infrastructure is initiated.
Cl. Coastal and environmental management strengthening ($0.90 m total cost): Advisory services will help to
develop a national strategy and methods for managing infrastructure in the coastal zone that preserves environmental
assets, involves local stakeholders and provides justifiable levels of protection to economic assets from storm damage.
This has a number of related objectives:
* the development of a coastal zone management strategy to ensure that economic growth, construction of
infrastructure, and the use of natural resources within the coastal zone is sustainable and does not cause
significant adverse environmental effects; and
* to ensure that infrastructure assets in the coastal zone, including coastal protection systems, are designed and
constructed according to sound practices taking account of: the nature and severity of the natural hazards, the
economic benefits/costs, and environmental effects.
There are some 140 villages in coastal zones of the two main islands, comprising about 53% of the population. The
village councils (fono) administer the use of customary land and resources and thus must be directly involved in the
development and implementation of any management processes. New draft national Regulations for environmental
management therefore have to be interpreted and applied at local levels to be effective. The services will achieve the
objectives through the following tasks:
a)    Defining the coastal hazard zone (CHZ) around both main islands, which assesses the inland
penetration of potential storm damage based on aerial photographic surveys and surface cross-
sectional surveys - extending the method developed during pilot surveys in 1998;
b)    Defining a national coastal infrastructure management strategy (CIMS) which meets the objectives
above;
c)    Facilitating the preparation and implementation of a Coastal Infrastructure Management Plan (CIMP)
that controls the use of natural resources, construction of infrastructure and economic activities in a
District, with the effective participation of the village inhabitants and endorsement of the villagefonos,
for selected coastal Districts.
d)    Guiding and training public and private proponents of works in the application of environmental
impact assessment (EIA) techniques, methods for monitoring environmental impacts, and mitigation
methods, e.g. consultants, contractors, village groups, departments; and
e)    Developing guidelines and encouraging improved practices in Samoa for the design and management
of coastal protection, including the evaluation of alternatives such as beach replenishment, rock walls,
land reclamation, etc.
C2. Updating of geographic information ($0.60 m total cost): In order to improve the quality of land and geographic
information available to asset managers and the public, this component will produce the following:
*     C2.01 - Aerial photographic survey, producing i) a series of 1:50,000 scale orthophotographs for the
publication of general topographic maps, and analysis of river systems and land use; ii) a series of 1:5,000
scale orthophotographs for use in coastal management and the design of coastal infrastructure; and iii) a
new series of countrywide topographic and land-use maps.
*     C2.02 - Supply and implementation of a geographic information system (GIS) computerized database and
software, for the storage, retrieval and management of land-related data and information, to be
administered by DLSE and made available for access by public and private users.



Project Appraisal Document                Page 35                  Title: Infrastructure Asset Management Project
Country: Samoa
C3. Extend coastal protection to warrantedpriority areas ($0.8 m total cost): Two coastal sites designated by GoS
based on community requests were selected for evaluation under the pilot surveys during Project preparation, namely:
*     C3.01      Fagali'i, est. construction cost $74,000 (WST 223,000);
*     C3.02      Faga, est. construction cost $100,000 (WST 298,000).
These subprojects will be used to refine and demonstrate the new approach to coastal management and protection,
involving environmental, consultative, hazard-based engineering and economic evaluation. Coastal transect profile
surveys were conducted to define the coastal hazard zone (CHZ), and site details and the economic evaluation are
given in Annex 4, Table A4-4. Local engineering firms will do the EIA, design and supervision under the oversight of
the Coastal, Environmental and Institutional Services consultants (CI) in order to develop local capacity, the
communities will participate throughout the process in a consultative role, and local contractors will undertake the
construction.
Project Component D: Institutional Development-US$3.1 million (total cost of component)
OUTPUTD:  Management of infrastructure assets is becoming service-oriented, involving public, private and
community stakeholders.
Dl.   Reform of public works delivery, private sector development and road asset management and planning ($2.0
m total cost): Comprehensive assistance will be provided to PWD through an international firm for achieving the first
major stage of restructuring from the role of direct service provider into a role more oriented to asset management and
policy advice, building on the 1996-97 PWDIS studies. This will include: (a) Based on continuing in-house
consultations with staff, PWD will identify business centers and costs, the mode schedule and extent of private sector
involvement, develop training and reskilling support for staff, introduce financial management and information
technology systems, and improve procurement and supervision on outsourced activities; (b) Programs to strengthen
the capacity, contract procedures and quality in the private sector; (c) Implementation of a road asset management
system, including inventory and condition monitoring of the network and production of performance-based road and
bridge preservation programs for the annual budget; (d) Preparation of a medium-term expenditure plan for the road
sector; and (e) Review of the structure of the road transport sector, including organization and cost recovery. The
reforms will be staged in 18-mth and 12-mth periods. Also, feasibility studies and appraisal will be conducted of road
upgrading subprojects from the medium-term plan, applying the new methods under guidance for the PWD ITS, for
implementation under IAM-2 and the GoS capital development budget. Related contracts include:
*     Dl.01      PWD institutional and technical advisory services
*     Dl .02     Supply of road asset management system and monitoring equipment
*     D1l.03     Supply of information technology for PWD
*     D1.04      Local consulting services for appraisal of road upgrading subprojects.
D2.   Adopt asset and information management approach ($0.21 m total cost):   While PWD is introducing
computer-based asset management for roads, bridges and pedestrian facilities under its control (see DI), a small
amount of advisory services will be provided to GoS to coordinate and establish the technology protocols for the
computer systems, information and data standards, the communication networks, quality control, and the storage,
retrieval and access privileges needed to make all infrastructure information available to stakeholders, including the
public where appropriate. The linkage with the DLSE land, terrain and demographic data to be managed on the GIS
system (see C2) is particularly important, including access to relevant environmental and other studies which often
previously have been unobtainable or kept offshore by the sponsoring agency.
D3.   Improve traffic administration and road safety ($0.32 m total cost):  Under management by the Transport
Control Board (TCB), this will cover: (a) Updating and computerization of vehicle registration, driver licensing and
accident records; and (b) Support for implementing the Road Safety Action Plan, including extended road safety

Country: Samoa
education, vehicle inspection and testing, driver training and testing, accident records, traffic enforcement, and public
awareness raising. There will be effective links to the road safety civil works in B2 and B3.
D4.   Institutional strengthening of Lands, Survey and Environment ($0.34 m total cost):   Associated with
internally-led DLSE discussions, an institutional analysis of DLSE by an international firm (under the contract for C1)
to assess current strengths and weaknesses, identify the core and non-core roles, functions and business processes, and
evaluate options for the reform and restructuring of DLSE. This output would be thoroughly reviewed and discussed
by GoS and key stakeholders later in IAM-1, and used to develop an implementation and financing plan. NZODA is
expected to support facilitation of the internal discussions with separate grant funding during IAM- 1. On GoS request,
parts of the implementation plan may be supported through IAM-2.
D5.   Samoa Airport Authority Business Improvements ($0.18 m total cost): Advisory services will help SAA to:
(a) Strengthen financial management and upgrade the accounting system; (b) Prepare business and corporate plans;
(c) Reduce operating costs and enhance revenues to achieve cost recovery objectives; and (d) Evaluate the three minor
airports with respect to operation, management and financial obligations.
Project Component E: Project Management-US$1.3 million (total cost of component)
El.   Project Preparation ($0.26 m total cost):  A Project Preparation Coordinator was retained for 16 months
(March 1998 to May 1999) to assist preparation of IAM-1, facilitate advance procurement, and manage
implementation until establishment of the PMU. Studies for the airport component (SAAFIA and ICAO reports) and
financial management were also funded.
E2.   Project Management ($1.04 m total cost):  A three person PMU will be established from May 1999 to
December 2001, comprising a Project Management Engineer (PME), Project Accountant (PA) and communications
facilitator. The PNMU will coordinate delivery of the Project and, with the IA-PCMs, be responsible to the Steering
Committee for facilitating and monitoring procurement, monitoring and evaluation of the physical and development
monitoring indicators against the targets, project accounting, facilitating consultations, information disclosure and
media communications, reporting monthly statements on Project progress to IAM-PSC, preparing quarterly progress
reports (and eventually PMR's), preparing the implementation completion report, and helping to prepare IAM-2.

Annex 4: Economic Analysis Summary
1.     Overview
The three sets of physical components involved in this project, namely: (i) airport rehabilitation; (ii) roads and bridges,
and (iii) coastal protection works, differ substantially in the bases appropriate for their economic assessment. Only for
the roads and bridges component does the economic assessment involve a straightforward conventional cost benefit
analysis methodology. For the airport component, strict safety and technical standards, governed by international and
individual country aviation authorities, apply and there are limited technically feasible alternatives. For the coastal
protection component, the probabilistic nature of the "hazard events" (mainly cyclones), poses challenging cost benefit
methodological and empirical issues.
A summary of the economic assessment of these components together with the key findings is set out below. A more
comprehensive documentation is available in the Project Files (See Annex 8, B.5).
2.     Airport Component - Faleolo International Airport
2.1    Objectives
The Faleolo airport component involves both civil works and institutional strengthening of the Samoa Airport
Authority (SAA). Both of these sub-components serve directly the overall development objectives of the project. The
runway, apron and taxiway works, together with the replacement of obsolete emergency equipment, are essential to
ensure continuation of safe, reliable and efficient operation of a key infrastructure asset, in accordance with
international aviation safety requirements. In addition, the terminal works are designed to provide a level of terminal
performance and quality of service that is consistent with airport industry standards, appropriate to Samoa, its
circumstances and its own development strategy.

Country: Samoa
The objective of the institutional component is to improve the capacity of the SAA in the financial management,
strategic business planning, and human resource development. This sub-component also serves directly the
institutional development objective of the project, including improved physical and financial management of the
country's major infrastructure assets.
2.2    Basis of Assessment
Worldwide minimum acceptable safety/technical standards for airports are established and governed by ICAO
(International Civil Aviation Organization), an organization affiliated with the United Nations. Most countries are
members ("contracting states") of ICAO, and its specified standards are universally recognized as a requirement for
"'unconstrained" international air services. Although Samoa is a member of ICAO (since 1996), it has outsourced the
certification of its airports/aviation facilities to a neighboring state (New Zealand), which is a full member of ICAO.
For the rehabilitation of the interior of the terminal building, the primary basis of assessment is "minimum acceptable"
service levels, also based on industry standards as applicable to small international airports. For terminal facilities
levels (categories) of service are recommended by the International Air Transport Association (IATA). IATA is the
summit organization of the world's scheduled international air carriers. Apart from security provisions, quality of
service at airports is primarily governed by passengers and baggage processing times and the capacity (floor space) of
queuing/holding areas for check-in, outwards immigration, departure lounge, arrivals immigration, baggage claim, and
customs inspection, all based on the "forecast busy hour".
2.3    Significance of Faleolo International Airport
Market Context
As a small island State in the South Pacific, Samoa is located at relatively large distances from its international
markets. Air and sea transport provide connections that are vital to the sustainable economic growth and social well
being of the country's resident population. Efficient and adequate qualityaviation services and enabling infrastructure
are especially important for Samoa to develop its export-oriented sectors in the increasingly competitive international
environment of the Pacific Rim and beyond. This is especially so for tourism and its associated infrastructure, which
are a central part of the Government's development strategy. As the country's only international airport for jet air
services, Faleolo is crucial for connections to major trading partners and for foreign tourist visitors. At the level of the
whole Samoan economy, a substantial share of economic activity is related, directly and indirectly, to the airport.
The airport also contributes towards the maintenance of strong social ties between the large number of Samoan citizens
who live overseas (comparable in numbers to the resident population), especially in New Zealand, Australia, and USA.
Not only do these ties serve a strong cultural role but they also are associated with a very large source of income by
way of remittances from abroad -- a form of foreign capital transfers (variously estimated to be of the order of one-
quarter of national income).
The historical record of aircraft and passenger movements at Faleolo from 1991-1997 are shown in Figures A4-1(a)
and (b). Traffic has fluctuated in recent years, partly due to two recent cyclones and diversion of non-jet aircraft to
Fagali'i (primarily serving America Samoa). However, traffic studies suggest a low scenario forecast of 4 per cent per
annum growth in passenger movements over the next 10 - 15 years. On this basis, forecasted passenger movements in
year 2005 and 2015 are 230,099 and 340,603, respectively.
Economic Contribution of Faleolo International Airport to the Samoan Economy
Good air services to Samoa's major international partners (especially, New Zealand, Australia, USA, and Fiji) are vital
to the Samoan economy. A recent study lapplied an updated input-output tableaux to the Samoan Economy which

allowed indicative estimates to be made of various economy-wide aggregates. The study estimated that (a) the direct
and flow-on effects of tourism account for an estimated 5.5 % and 10%, respectively of gross national product (est.

WST 393m.), and 1749 jobs or 14.1% of (formal sector) national employment; (b) the direct and flow-on effects of
Faleolo airport activity on turnover (excluding tourism) represents WST 88 million or 13.6% of gross national output
(est. WST646 m) and 1,334 full time jobs (10.8% of national formnal employment); and (c) temporary closure of
Faleolo airport - interruption of operations for a period of one month - would result in a loss varying from
approximately 1% (December or January) to 0.5% (April) of gross national product, based on a very conservative loss
(only 75%) of foreign tourists.
These findings' indicate the extent of the impact, and adjustments that would be imposed on the Samoan economy, if
the airport had to be closed, even temporarily, as a result of failing to maintain the airport infrastructure, at the
necessary international operational and safety standards. In brief, even though a full cost benefit analysis of Faleolo
airport - with and without major international air services - is neither possible nor warranted, there is strong evidence
supporting justification of maintaining the present role of the airport.
Assessment of Individual Airport Sub-components
A comprehensive safety audit and review of operations at all four of SAA's airports was conducted by ICAO. The
findings are presented in the Report Safetv Audit and Operational Review of Samoa Airport Authoritv Operations at
Faleolo International Airport and at Fagali 'i. Maota. and Asau Airports, June 1998 (in Project File). The key finding
of the safety audit is that all airports conform to ICAO Annex 14 requirements (with allowable exceptions). However,
the ICAO Report recommends that at Faleolo International "a bitumen overlay of the existing runway pavement
surface (should) be taken up urgently and also that the runway extension, apron widening and new connecting taxiway
should be carried out", as proposed under the project. All facilities and equipment identified as first priority by the
ICAO safety audit are proposed under the project, with the exception of navigational aids and communications
equipment, for which it is understood assistance from.EU has been agreed. An overview of assessment issues for each
subcomponent is noted below. A detailed justification and assessment of the individual airport subcomponents based
on the recommendations of the ICAO Safety Audit is in the Project Files (see Annex 8 B.5).
Existing Runway, Taxiway, and Apron - Overlay With Grooving: The only real alternatives involve delaying overlay
strengthening until closure is declared and then either undertaking the overlay works or downgrading the pavement
surface and hence the level of operation of the airport, for example, with use restricted to small, turboprop aircraft.
Both these alternatives would essentially eliminate temporarily the role of Faleolo as Samoa's direct international air
The findings will involve an over-estimation of the impact of airport closure - in the medium term to long term as adjustments will take
place, but less so in a short period, such as one to two months. It should also be stressed that the magnitude of any activity's share in
national output does not imply a correspondence with social net benefit of that activity.

link to countries with which it has substantial economic, social and political ties. As noted above, the consequences of
this would be very substantial and politically entirely unacceptable. Given the present age of the pavement (12 years),
and the risks of unplanned closure and the forecasted traffic demand, there is a clear justification for undertaking the
proposed overlay investment as soon as possible. The economic life of this investment is expected to be 15 years.
Runway, Taxiway and Apron Extension: This proposed sub-component involves surfacing an existing 300 meter
stopway at the eastern end of the runway with a 75 mm asphalt overlay and providing a short linking taxiway (to allow
immediate exit from the runway). The estimated cost of US$ 270,000 is small as the subgrade and stopping pavement
are already in place and the cost is incremental to the main asphalt overlay work on the existing runway, which
includes a high establishment cost. There are two main benefits: (i) an enhanced safety margin, for wide-bodied jet
aircraft landings, given the severe weather conditions that occur in the region, especially heavy rainfall; and (ii)
additional aircraft pay load capacity and apron accommodation. Both the capacity increases are tied to future service
demands. However, there are considerable economies if introduced in conjunction with the resurfacing of the existing
runway, compared to undertaking the extension separately later, say in ten years (2009). In this case, these economies
amount to a savings of 60 per cent - US$ 270,000 vs. US$ 693,000 if the extension was carried out separately. An
analysis of alternative timing supports their provision as part of the proposed runway works (see Annex8, B.5 in
Project Files).
Rehabilitation of Existing Terminal Building: The existing terminal building is the result of a major development in
1987 and a series of extensions/modifications since. Although the terminal was intended to be designed to handle
"satisfactorily" a single B747 aircraft, this is not the case; the terminal is subject to substantial congestion in many
areas imposed regularly by B767 aircraft with high load factors, and especially B747 aircraft during the December-
January peak season. While the existing building is structurally sound, an assessment of its overall condition (BECA
Report, 1996 and SSAF/Air Plan Report, 1998) documents many shortcomings including: internal and external
appearance "unattractive/uninviting" and general amenity poor; inadequate space for baggage and cargo
processing/breakdown; passenger congestion/confusion and inadequate holding space with queue overflows (at
departure into the "farewelling zone" and on arrival onto the apron, and past customs on to the kerb/road); poor
opportunities for commercial concessions airside and landside.
Against these conditions a study of upgrading options for the terminal was conducted by BECA (Faleolo Terminal
Study Final Report, June 1996) and a current review of this Report was undertaken as part of the SAAFIA Report in
1998 (by Air Plan, Pty, Ltd.), as preparation for the present proposed project. Full details of the assessment and the
review of alternative terminal designs and their phased development are contained in these two reports (On Project
File). The objectives of this sub-component are to improve quality of service/performance levels provided by the
terminal facility (passenger and baggage processing time, security and safety, comfort and amenities, reduced damage,
reduced spill over, congestion to adjacent facilities), and improve the prospects for enhanced concession
revenue/rentals. Selection of the target levels of performance adopted was guided by a balance between standards
judged appropriate to Samoa in the context of neighbor States in the South Pacific region, and their achievement at
least investment and maintenance cost. A major constraint on costs was retention of the existing terminal building
structure: the primary thrust of the rehabilitation is redesign/reallocation of the existing floor space to improve terminal
performance.
Other Airport Sub-components: Additional proposed investments are modest in size, but are considered sufficiently
important, given their recommended adoption by the ICAO Safety Audit, to include under the project. All outstanding
high priority recommended investments have been included in the proposed project.
2.4    Benefits and Target Population
Benefits: In as much as not doing the proposed works would involve curtailment or closure of the airport, the benefits
of continued safe operation, are pervasive and substantial throughout the Samoan economy, especially through the
airport's key role in facilitating tourism. More directly, ensuring continuity of airport operation confers benefits on
existing and future airport users; both Samoan citizens and overseas visitors. It is noteworthy that just over one half of



Project Appraisal Document                  Page 42                    Title: Infrastructure Asset Management Project
Country: Samoa
the benefits accrue to Samoan citizens. The high propensity (and financial ability) of Samoan to travel (principally to
New Zealand, excluding American Samoa) is driven primarily by the large Samoan populations resident in New
Zealand, Australia and the USA, and the high level of remittances from these sources. Indeed, the preservation of these
strong social connections with good air services underpins the flow of remittances into Samoa with substantial
improvement in local consumption of "discretionary" goods and services and "insurance" income. Linkages to the
various sectors of the Samoan economy (accommodation, various services, food and beverages, etc.) have substantial
positive employment effects, although significant leakage to imports. Given the Samoan social structure these indirect
income effects are likely to be quite pervasive. However, their impact on poorer households is not evident.
2.5    Cost Recovery, User Charges, and Financial Sustainability
As a wholly state-owned enterprise under the Airport Authority Act, the SAA is obliged to secure progress towards
operating on a greater commercial and self-financing basis. However, the SAA has been constrained in pursuing its
commercial objective from four principal sources: (i) Government reluctance to approve increased user charges, (ii)
Government imposition of non-commercial investments/operations (these include the three small airports), (iii) limited
size of the market for air services to Samoa, and (iv) limited pursuit of cost reduction opportunities. Against these
circumstances, the SAA has incurred annual operating losses in the order of WST 1.5-2.0 million (USD 0.5-7 million)
over the last few years.
The low level of aircraft and passenger movements at Faleolo highlights one of the major financial difficulties of many
modern airports. Due to location/stage length and air service aircraft economics, these airports need to be designed to
accommodate large wide-body jet aircraft, yet are able to generate only modest traffic levels, and hence, low
utilization, and a substantial fixed cost burden on the airport authorities operating these airports. Such airports may be
justified on economic grounds but unable to meet full cost recovery through normal direct user charges (primarily
aircraft landing fees and passenger levies). Accordingly, realistic cost recovery targets need to be set for such airports,
which include Faleolo, while at the same time ensuring that the level of investment and its use is efficient.
Although the GoS is implementing reform for the public sector and increased private sector participation in
infrastructure these changes are progressing in line with accommodation to cultural factors. Therefore, Faleolo airport,
through the SAA, can be expected to remain squarely in the public sector for the foreseeable future. However, this
heightens the need to foster efficiency in the operation of the SAA.
A recent review of airport charges - Va'ai and Associates, Airport Tariff and Revenue Study, 1998 (see Annex 8, C .c
on Project File) - recommended increases in airport landing charges, building rentals, ground handling and the
passenger departure charges, largely to bring charges in line with other airports in the region and improve cost
recovery. These recommendations were accepted by the Government, with the exception of the passenger departure
charge (an increase from WST 20 to WST 30). However, during project preparation the Government indicated a
willingness to adopt this increase, on the Bank's recommendation that it would be timely if introduced after the
proposed improvements to the airport terminal had been commenced.
Although the SAA faces low utilization of Faleolo Airport and the scope to influence traffic is limited and outside the
control of the SAA, there is potential for the SAA to enhance its revenue base; (i) through increased concession
income following the terminal rehabilitation, (ii) annual review of airport user charges (including monitoring of the
charges at neighbor airports as benchmarks, (iii) raising user charges at the small airports, especially Falali'i, (iv)
charging interest on overdue airline accounts, and (v) leasing of airport land.
Financial reporting within the SAA falls short of requirements, due in part to factors outside the SAA's control,
including GoS audit processes. However, financial management within the SAA does have a number of weaknesses,
including: (i) lack of capacity to implement standard accounting packages, (ii) accounts not up to date, (iii) fixed asset
register not current, (iv) capital expenditure decisions not fully analyzed for rate of return, future maintenance
obligations, or financial impact, and (v) lack of information at a functional disaggregate level to enable sound asset
management -- especially separate cost and revenue information for aeronautical/non-aeronautical activities, and for

Country: Samoa
operations as each of the four individual airports. The proposed institutional strengthening/capacity building sub-
component for the SAA is directed at addressing these problems during the early part of IAM- 1.
In combination with deepening the financial management capacity of the SAA, there are a number of areas with
potential for cost reduction efficiencies, including internal organization and outsourcing, particularly in areas (for
example, security and cleaning) and operations at the three small airports. The latter involve functions which are non-
commercial (financial loss-making) but which the SAA is obliged to provide. At present, these functions are, in effect,
financed by cross-subsidization (in part, by other SAA revenue sources, but essentially by government cover of
operating losses). It would be desirable for these functions to be separately treated and funded explicitly and directly
by the Government. In addition, there appear to be options for reducing the cost of the services associated with the
three small airports. Accordingly, it is proposed that a study of the economic, social, and financial aspects of these
small airports be undertaken early in IAM-1.
A final issue for assessment is the financial impact of proposed Faleolo Airport infrastructure investments on the SAA.
As a total package the proposed investments amount to WST$22.2 million (US$ 7.4 million). These new investments
represent a major increase in fixed costs (depreciation and interest). On the basis of estimated SAA financial
statements for FY1997, the financial impact of undertaking the proposed investments in FY1999 has been explored
under several future traffic growth, income, and cost reduction scenarios. This impact also explicitly recognized an
allowance of WST 1.7 million per annum for other SAA fixed assets (see SAAFIA Report, Chapter 5). The key
finding is that the SAA should be in a position to break-even in FY 2010, including coverage of annual loan
repayments for the proposed airport works, provided the recommended increase of WST 10 in passenger departure fee
is adopted, cost reductions are introduced, and traffic growth is in the 4 - 5% range. A separate examination of the
recommended passenger departure fee increase of WST 10 and the recently introduced aircraft landing charge of WST
10 per 1000 kg (of aircraft max. take-off weight) reveals that these increases can be forecast to generate SAA revenue
increases of WST 12.3 million and WST 7.7 million , respectively, in present value terms , based upon passenger
growth at 4 per cent p.a. and aircraft movements at 1.5 per cent p.a.. i.e., a total increase of WST 20 million. This
indicates that 90 per cent recovery of the WST 22.2 million cost of the proposed investment can be achieved. (Note
that if there was no growth in traffic, these user charge increases can still be expected to generate a total of WST 15
million for 75 per cent cost recovery.)' The prospects for recovery of the SAA's overall costs will be addressed in the
financial and business management assistance for the SAA proposed in LAM-1.
2.6    Fiscal Impact
The fiscal impact of the airport investment component is primarily through potential demands on government
expenditure to cover any increase in the SAA operating deficit. The impact on government revenues through any
increase in net expenditure associated with the airport investments, in particular, terminal improvements and
concession sales, is expected to be modest. Net increase in value added tax receipts is likely to be negligible. The
impact on government expenditure is tied to the full implementation of the recommended increases in airport charges -
- i.e., approval of the increased passenger departure fee, as well as other revenue sources. A number of potential cost
efficiencies (as detailed in the SAAFIA Report) will also reduce the prevailing deficit cover. Notwithstanding the
prospects for achieving positive fiscal impact from strengthening SAA's ability to improve its commercial position, the
main factor conditioning the fiscal impact will be future traffic levels. These are driven directly (for overseas visitors)
and indirectly (for Samoans) by the country economic conditions of Samoa's major trading partners.
3.     Roads and Bridges Component
3.1    Objective and Benefits
The major objective of the proposed civil works for roads, bridges and pedestrian facilities is to improve the efficiency
and safe operation of the road transport system, in the context of increasing motorization and traffic growth. The road

works proposed in IAM-1 emphasize safety improvements for which the benefits are decrease in road accidents
(including pedestrians) and travel time savings. Some possible road upgrading in locations where new scenic coastal
vistas are opened, are expected to generate tourist traffic and enhance tourism net benefits. For bridge works, the
benefits accrue in the form of increased safety and reduced accidents (especially from narrow one lane bridges),
increased load bearing capacity, smoother traffic flow and time savings, and lower life cycle infrastructure costs.
3.2     Basis of Assessment
Roads and bridges proposed under the project will be assessed within a programmatic framework. Typically, proposed
road works will be assessing using conventional HDM analyses. For bridge replacement works, the cost-benefit
analysis will focus on savings deriving from removal of load restrictions, accident reduction, elimination of delays
through the widening from one- to two-lane capacity, and lower VOC and time costs from avoiding the need for detour
due to closure of the bridge at the end of its structural life. All proposed bridges replace narrow, single or 1.5-lane
facilities with significant corrosion to the steel or concrete structures. Given the safety considerations, rehabilitation of
the single lane structures is not cost effective. Half the bridges are on key road links that carry substantial traffic
volumes (above 1,000 veh./day) and others provide the only basic road access to villages. The key characteristics of
the IAM- I bridge program are set out in Table A4-2.

For the pedestrian facilities, the cost-benefit analysis assesses the expected savings deriving from reduction in
accidents, fatalities and injuries, and evaluates switching values of these accident savings relative to the cost of works.
The proposed program, shown in Table A4-3, comprises 4.7 km of pedestrian facilities serving about 30,000
pedestrians daily at a cost of WST 700,000. The program is highly justified based on expected accident savings alone
(assuming that effectively connected accidents are reduced by 50%), as the switching value at which schemes would
become uneconomic is a low value of WST 7,780 (USD2,590) per statistical accident. The proposed program has a
benefit:cost ratio conservatively estimated at 30:1

4.     Coastal Protection Infrastructure
4.1    Objective and Benefits
Samoa is exposed to severe hazardous weather, especially cyclone events. These events damage the natural coastline
as well as man-made assets located in a coastal hazard zone. The overall objective of this component is to provide
integrated and environmentally sustainable planning and management of coastal infrastructure assets. A coastal
infrastructure management strategy, including adoption of rigorous assessment of design alternatives in combination
with local community consultation and awareness, can be expected to yield a more socially, environmentally, and
economically sustainable outcome for the very valuable natural and man-made assets located in Samoa's coastal areas.
For individual sites where a possible protection intervention is proposed, the principal benefits aresavings in expected
physical damage/repair costs to assets (such as road infrastructure, schools, churches, and fales) from future cyclones
as well as savings in the avoided costs of the ensuing social and economic disruption (typically until damaged facilities
can be repaired/restored). In addition, there are benefits, or possibly disbenefits, associated with a site's environmental
assets. Some protective interventions, such as rock walls, may impair the local environmental amenity and
attractiveness --- this may have a negative economic (and financial) impact through reduction in exports (foreign
tourism). These disbenefits need to be factored in to a full cost benefit analysis of intervention alternatives. Indeed,
ironically, without due care, a rock wall may provide high protection to the road and buildings at a beach resort, but so
change the site as to eliminate the (natural shoreline) main source of the demand for the resort. In such a case, the
expected losses (or possibly insurance premiums) with an unprotected site (or at least not with rock walls) become a
business expense; the commercial sustainability of the site hinges on whether it remains profitable.
Quantification of environmental amenity benefits and estimation of the savings in disruption costs from (typically
temporary) loss of an asset, such as a road section or church have also been set aside at this early stage. Further
development and refinement of the assessment methodology is planned to be progressed through Phases 1 and 2.
4.2    Assessment Methodology
The economic justification of major protection civil works is based primarily upon aneconomic cost benefit analysis.
The methodology calls for balancing the capital and maintenance costs of alternative protection works against the
expected savings in asset loss from exposure to various severe weather events. Behind this basic approach there is a
need to characterize the severity of rare weather events (specifically cyclones) in such a way as to enable the
probability and degree of damage of their impact on specific coastal sites to be estimated, contingent upon investment
in particular protection structures. The technical/coastal engineering analysis of alternative designs and the bases of
damage prevention and capital and maintenance/replacement costs of protection are set out in Appendix A to the
Coastal Component Implementation Plan. Accordingly, the implementation of the methodology developed here for
economic appraisal is "experimental" and based on five steps:
Step 1: For each specific site proposed for protection, an inventory of all existing assets (road section,
houses, community fales, schools, churches, retail stores, commercial activity, other) in the hazard zone
is established and a valuation assigned to each asset, normally its current replacement cost.
Step 2: A set of alternative protection designs is formulated, for example, rock sea wall, breakwater, or
beach nourishment. The capital and maintenance cost of each alternative is estimated, together with its
protection performance at a specific site for various cyclone events, by return period. The "Do Nothing"
alternative is adopted as the base alternative.
Step 3: For each alternative protection design, the spatial pattern of intrusion - "hazard impact area" -
for various levels of cyclone intensity (return period) and associated probability is estimated. (In the
preliminary approach, this impact area was fixed at a 30 meters strip along the coastline.)

Country: Samoa
Step 4: The impact of each protection intervention on the coastal natural environment is identified and,
as appropriate, loss/gain in environmental amenity associated with each protection alternative. These
valuations should draw on local transferability of valuation associated information about similar
amenities, to the extent that it exists. In general, these are not available, in which case switching
valuations (as benefits or disbenefits) may be used to guide design. (In the preliminary approach,
environmental evaluation will be addressed by a separate approach, involving village consultation.)
Step 5: The best protection structure is identified by a balance between additional capital works and
maintenance cost (together with any environmental disbenefits) and increased savings in expected asset
(and service) loss, i.e., that protection alternative which provides the highest expected net present value
of benefits less costs, relative to the do nothing alternative. In some locations, only a very limited
number of alternative structures may be technically feasible and practical; this is often the case with sea
wall design. In other locations, it may be optimal to introduce no protection works, while in others,
control of land use and, in particular, restrictions on private/village development of the land and the
foreshore may warrant negotiation. The latter warrants serious attention in situations where local actions
(for example, establishing a auto service station, removing beach sand, or constructing groynes ) impose
negative externalities. In all cases including customary land intervention will hinge on consultation and
agreement with local villages.
Two specific coastal protection sub-projects, advanced by GoS for the Phase 1 works program, have been assessed on
economic grounds. Details of application of the methodology and data used are documented in the Project file. These
sub-projects will serve as pilots to test the overall coastal management strategy, including consultation. Details of the
technical basis for design of protection alternatives, including estimation of their capital and maintenance (partial
replacement) costs, and characterization of a vulnerability index and estimation of damages prevented, are set out in
the Coastal Protection Component BPIP, particularly Appendix A. The results of the combined technical-economic
analysis for two pilot sites, proposed for Phase 1 of the Program, are summarized in Table A4-4.

These results indicate that "Improved Protection" is warranted at both the Fagili'i and Faga sites, as it yields a positive
net present value of WST 2.279 million and WST 0.338 million respectively, at these sites. (The corresponding IRRs
are 132 per cent and 25 per cent, respectively.) These results are most sensitive to the lowest intensity cyclone (high
frequency) for which "damage vulnerability" becomes negligible. (A ten year return period was adopted, however a 15
year return period in both cases drops the NPV to a negative level.) This indicates the need for more technical work on
establishing "tight" estimates of this factor.
As noted above, this pilot analysis applied omits some benefits and costs. Protection will also provide savings from
prevention of disruption of road traffic and disruption of the services associated with buildings. On the cost side, the
protection works "disturb" the amenity value of the natural coastline. Approaches to valuation of these other areas will
be developed as the CHZ Strategy and its evaluation is progressed beyond this preliminary pilot stage during Phase 1.
4.3    Aspects of Bank Experience in Post-Cyclone Reconstruction and Mitigation
The Bank has been involved for over 20 years in a number of projects involving reconstruction and mitigation
associated with cyclones. In many cases the impact extends far beyond coastal areas; often it involves large regions of
a country. A summary overview of Bank experience in cyclone related projects has been prepared and is available in
the Project Files. Work in other countries has demonstrated that impacts can extend across many sectors and that this
allows the impacts of such devastating events to be traced, especially on the poor.
Increasing emphasis is being placed on (i) the sustainability of restoration and the prevention of future losses (rather
than simply the repair of current losses which remain just as vulnerable to potential damage as before); (ii)
environmental sustainability issues, and (iii) social issues as ecosystems and natural forms of coastal defense are
threatened by rapid expansion of cities including land reclamation in coastal areas.

Annex 6: Procurement and Disbursement Arrangements
1.    Procurement of works and goods will follow IDA Guidelines dated January 1995, revised in January and
August 1996, September 1997 and January 1999. Standard Bidding Documents (including standard prequalification
and bid evaluation documents) will be used for all IDA financed procurement. Procurement of consulting services will
conform to IDA Guidelines dated January 1997, revised in September 1997 and January 1999. A Procurement Plan,
providing a timeline for each step in the procurement process is included in the PIP, and will be updated quarterly.
Procurement methods (Table A)
2.    The project costs by procurement arrangement are shown in Table A. Works with a contract value estimated
to cost over $1 million, including the airport runways and terminal, will be procured by International Competitive
Bidding (ICB). Works with a contract value estimated to cost less than $1 million, including bridges, roads, coastal
protection and traffic safety, are small and scattered and will be procured by National Competitive Bidding (NCB). Of
the works financed under the credit, 51% will be ICB. The NCB procedures have been reviewed: the documents are
based on New Zealand S 3910-1989, which is itself based on FIDIC IV, and are broadly consistent with Section I of
the Guidelines and acceptable to IDA.
3.    Goods with a contract value estimated to be more than $ 100,000 will be procured by ICB, with the exception
of specialized asset management equipment which, with an estimated contract value of up to $ 130,000, will be
procured by Limited International Bidding (LIB). Goods with a contract value of less than $ 100,000, generally
consisting of computing, office equipment and some traffic safety items, will be procured by NCB in order to ensure
after-sales-service. At the request of the borrower, a margin of preference may be provided in the evaluation of bids for
goods manufactured in Samoa, as provided in par. 2.54 and 2.55 of the Guidelines. ICB will be used for 80% of the
value of goods procured under the project.
4.    Consultants will be appointed following IDA Selection of Consultants dated July 1997, revised April 1998.
Firms will be appointed for most services, as shown in Table Al, using QCBS, with the exception of the Technical and
Economic Review of SAA which was carried out during project preparation, for which the same consultant was used
who had carried out Phase I of the study, and for which a single source procedure was used. Individuals were or will
be appointed for the services of Project Preparation Coordinator, Project Management Unit, and short term advisors to
PWD and SAA. All consulting assignments with a contract value estimated to cost more than $ 200,000 will be
advertised in Development Business.
Prequalification
5.    Contractors for ICB works, which have an estimated contract value of more than $1 million, will be
prequalified in accordance with IDA guidelines. Contractors for NCB works are registered according to class with
PWD, but foreign contractors who wish to bid are permitted to do so and are post-qualified.
Prior review thresholds (Table B).
6.    The thresholds for procurement by ICB, NCB and LIB are shown in Table B. The thresholds for prior review
are the same, with the exception that the first two contracts for NCB procurement of the annual program of works will
be subject to prior review. The threshold for prior review of ICB works is US$ I million equivalent and for prior
review of goods US$ 100,000 equivalent. Prior review would apply to 79% of the total value of works and goods
procurement under the project. Ex post review would cover 100% of contracts not subject to prior review.

Allocation of loan proceeds (rable C).
7.    The allocation of credit proceeds is shown in Table C, together with the disbursement percentage proposed in
each category.
Use of statements of expenses (SOEs).
8.    For Civil Works contracts valued at less than US$1,000,000 equivalent and Goods contracts valued at less than
US$100,000 equivalent, applications will be supported by Statements of Expenditure (SOEs). For Civil Works
contracts valued at US$1,000,000 equivalent and over, for Goods contracts valued at US$100,000 equivalent and over,
for Specialized Asset Management Equipment and all consulting service contracts, withdrawal applications would be
supported by full documentation and signed contracts.
Special account
9.    In order to facilitate disbursements for local and small expenditures, two Special Accounts will be established
in a bank acceptable to IDA and on terms and conditions acceptable to IDA. The accounts will be established in the
Central Bank of Samoa and managed by the Departmnent of the Treasury, Ministry of Finance. One account would be
maintained in US dollars, with an authorized allocation of USD 500,000.00 equivalent, an initial deposit of USD
250,000.00 equivalent and the balance to be withdrawn when the amounts disbursed and committed total USD
2,000,000.00 (SDR 1,450,000) equivalent. The second account will be maintained in Australian dollars for
disbursement of the AusAID grant funds, with an authorized allocation of AUD..., an initial deposit of AUD ..., and
the balance to be withdrawn when the amounts disbursed and committed total AUD ... equivalent. The borrower
would submit a replenishment application for the Special 1kccount on a monthly basis or when the account is drawn
down by 30 percent of the initial deposit, whichever occurs first. Replenishment of the Special Accounts would follow
IDA procedures. The Special Accounts and the Project accounts would be audited annually by independent auditors
acceptable to IDA.
Retroactive Financing
10.   In order to finance implementation activities not covered under the Project Preparation Advance, retroactive
financing in an amount up to SDR 1,000,000 (9.7 percent of the IDA Credit amount) will be provided. Payment made
for consultant services, civil works and goods for Component A, International Airport Infrastructure and Component
B, Road System Infrastructure, procured in accordance with the provisions above and expended after July 1, 1998,
shall be eligible for retroactive financing. This provision allows the most urgent physical investment priorities, which
include the design, runway works and emergency equipment procurement for the safety improvement at the airport,
and urgent bridge engineering and works, to proceed on schedule prior to the expected Credit effectiveness date of
May 1999.

Dear Mr Rohland,
I wish to advise that in considering the proposed Infrastructure Asset Management Project, my
Govemment submits herewith for your Management's approval, the details as set out as follows.
Letter Of Development Program
Introduction
1. After recovering from the impact of natuwral disasters and economic slowdown in the past
decade, the Govenmment of Samoa has embarked on a national strategy to strengthen the economy
against external shocks, change the role of Government in the delivery and management of
services and stimulate the private sector. In this context, the Government is actively pursuing a
national program to improve the management and provision of its infiastructure assets. The
primary goal of the Infrastructure Asset Management Program (LAMP) is for transport and
coastal infrastructure assets to be managed by an effective partnership of all stakeholders to
perform reliably under the prevailing rsks with the least appropriate participation of Government.
In the short-term, the IAMP will address vital infastructure priorities in order to ensure
continuity in the provision of safe air and surface transportation. In order to build for the longer-
term objective, the IAMP will introduce and strengthen asset management practices including
new strategies and national policies for the management of infrastructure in the coastal zone that
preserve environmental assets. The national IAMP will help change the role of government in the
delivery and management of infrastructure services in the three priority sub-sectors, namely air
transport, road transport and coastal protection.
2.   The IAMP is a national program established to rn over a period of 8 years from 1999 to
2007. Implementation of the program has been organized into two phases to allow the
progressive accumulation of asset management skills and institutional capabilities at different
rates in the three implementing agencies. The investment components focus on the airport
infrastructure in the first phase, and on road and coastal infrastructure in the second phase



Project Appraisal Document                  Page 65                   Title: Infrastructure Asset Management Project
Country: Samoa
applying the skills and capabilities developed in the first phase, including in particular road
planning and the environmental and coastal management strategies.
3.   The IAMP draws primarily on extemal assistance through two sources. About 75% of the
financing would be by IDA for the full 8-year period through an Adaptable Program Loan.
About 4% has been confirmed through annual grant funding from the Australian Agency for
Intemational Development (AusAID) for the first phase, and more may be available in the second
phase. The Government would fund the remainder, comprising 18% of Phase I and up to 30% of
Phase II, through budget allocation. The New Zealand Overseas Development Agency (NZODA)
has expressed intention to provide some additional support through parallel grant funding.
The Program
Goal and Development Objective
4.   The ultimate goal of the IAMP is for transport and coastal infrastructure assets to perform
reliably under the prevailing risks to the satisfaction of all stakeholders, in support of national
economic growth and quality of life. Three infrastructure subsectors, namely air transport, land
transport and the coastal zone, have been selected as priority subsectors because of their
vulnerability to natural disasters, their high costs and impact on the economy, and their potential
for greater private sector participation.
5.   The goal will be reached through development objectives which will: a) strengthen the
management of infrastructure assets, to be information-based and performance-oriented; b)
improve the the delivery and provision of infrastructure services by public and private sectors,
with a change in the role of government; c) address vital infrastructure investment priorities in a
timely sustainable manner; and d) optimize the economic, environmental and social sustainability
of all infrastructure expenditures in support of economic growth.
Phasing
6.   The Program has two consecutive, related phases: IAM-1 'Meeting Vital Priorities and
Strengthening Management' (years 1-3); and IAM-2 'Investing for Sustainable Growth and
Protection' (years 4-8).
Components
7.   The program implementation is structured around four components, comprising one for
physical investments and supporting services in each of the three infrastructure subsectors and
one for institutional capacity building in the four implementing agencies (PWD, TCB, DLSE and
SAA), i.e.: A) Airport Infrastructure, B) Road Infrastructure, C) Coastal Infrastructure, and D)
Institutional Strengthening.
8.   In IAM-1, the primary physical investment is required in airport infrastructure to maintain
safety and operational capacity for the crucial intemational gateway (36%), and smaller
investments in priority works for road infrastructure (bridge, road safety) and coastal protection
(29%). Equal emphasis is placed on key policy and institutional developments, appropriate to the
situation of each agency (29%). The key policy aspects comprise the development of a
participatory strategy for managing coastal infrastructure (involving villages, coastal hazard
zones and environmental management), and introduction of an asset management approach (with
supporting information and systems). The major institutional focus is on the first stage of reform



Project Appraisal Document                  Page 66                   Title: Infrastructure Asset Management Project
Country: Samoa
of the delivery of public works, involving PWD and the private sector. There are smaller
resources for identifying the direction of reform for Lands, Survey and Environment (DLSE),
road safety actions, review of the road transport sector, and moving the SAA toward financial
sustainability.
9.   In IAM-2, the priority for physical investment is the road sector, where extension of the
network to provide access to remote villages and to address rising capacity and safety issues on
the main artery will make use of the planning and asset management tools developed in IAM-I
(60%). For coastal infrastructure, the management strategy will be extended from pilot coverage
to full implementation. For institutional development, the focus will be on progressive
implementation (20%): i) asset information and management systems will become the primary
programming and budgeting tools for PWD and part of DLSE, and the protocols will be
considered by Treasury as a model for other agencies and sectors; u) PWD reform will progress
to a final phase of implementation;  iii) recommended reforms on road transport will be
implemented; iv) DLSE will implement the first phase of a reform plan to be agreed from IAM-
1; and v) SAA progress will be monitored.
Detailed Program Description
lAM-1
10.  With the vision of 'Meeting Vital Priorities and Improving Management', the development
objectives of the first phase, lAM-1, will be: i) strengthen the management of infrastructure
assets, to be information-based and performance-oriented; ii) improve the delivery and provision
of infrastructure services by public and private sectors, with a change in the role of government;
and iii) address vital infrastructure investmnent priorities in a timely sustainable manner. The
main outputs will include:
a)     For airport infrastructure, timely rehabilitation and minor expansion of runway,
terminal and air traffic control facilities, and urgent safety upgrading, of Faleolo
Intemational Airport to satisfy safety and operational requirements for the next
15 years,
b)     For road infrastructure, replacement of six vulnerable obsolete bridges,
implementation of road safety action plan works (including remedial treatments
for accident black spots, village and area treatments, etc.), and pedest'rian traffic
facilities;
c)     For coastal protection, updating the geographic knowledge base (including
production of countrywide maps), the initiaion of a strategy for participatory
management of coastal infrastructure (CIMS) in at least three districts, improve
the appraisal and design of coastal protection schemes, and implement priority
coastal protection investments;
d)     For institutional strengthening,: i) in PWD, a restructuring and business process
improvement plan for the delivery of public works, strengthening of the private
sector to develop greater capacity, systems for infrastructure asset management,
and preparation of a national road sector plan and medium-term development
program; ii) in the implementing agencies, appropriate protocols for asset
management and information management; (iii) in the Ministry of Transport,
improved road safety and administration of road transport; (iv) in DLSE,
identification of a reform program and strengthened environmental management;



Project Appraisal Document                Page 67                   Title: Infrastructure Asset Management Project
Country: Samoa
and (v) in SAA, improved financial management and business processes with
progress towards substantial financial autonomy.
IAM-2
11.  To meet the objective of IAM-2, Investing for Sustainable Growth and Protection, the
project will provide:
a)    Support for modest development of the road network, applying new appraisal
criteria for environmental sustainability, economic priority and social impact, to
meet priority needs for access and economic development in three corridors, and
to address safety and congestion on the main arterial road linking Apia to the
Faleolo Intemational Airport;
b)    Extension of the coastal infrastructure management strategy to the entire
coastline, support for priority protection investments and support for the reform
action plan for DLSE;
c)    Consolidation and continuation of progressive reform of public works delivery,
including commercialization or privatization of appropriate aspects, and applying
asset management to all related infrastructure assets; and possible support for
further strengthening of the business management of the SAA.
Expected Outcome
12. The expected outcomes of the IAM-1 Project will be:
a)    Increased capacity for safe and efficient handling of international air traffic, and
improved financial viability of Samoa Airport Authority (SAA).
b)    Existing primary road system assets in economically sustainable condition and
safer operation.
c)    Coastal hazard zones fully defined, initial experience with Coastal Infrastructure
Strategy evaluated, and geographic baseline data widely available in GIS
electronic format.
d)    Business-oriented management and private sector partnership for provision of
public infrastructure established in PWD, road network development plan, road
asset management system, road transport sector review, institutional reform plan
for DLSE, Road Safety Action Plan second phase (RSAP-ll).
13.  The expected outcomes of the IAM-2 Project, and thus the IAM Program, will be:
a)    Extended road access and safer roads for poverty alleviation and economic
development;
b)    Environmentally sustainable protection and resource use in the whole coastal
zone;
c)    The management of the environrnent, natural resources, and lands by the local
residents will be conservation-oriented and the quality of the coastal zone will be
enhanced;



Project Appraisal Document                Page 68                   Title: Infrastructure Asset Management Project
Country: Samoa
d)     Results reported by Asset management systems demonstrate that airport, road
and coastal infrastructure assets are performing well and are economically and
financially sustainable.
Organization
14   The IAM Program is overseen by a multi-departmental steering committee for the duration
of both phases. For IAM-1, in order to ensure effective management of implementation a project
component manager (PCM) appointed in each implementing agency (PWD, DLSE, SAA) will in
turn report to the Project Manager in the PMU. Procurement will be conducted under World Bank
guidelines and national procedures, with stringent monitoring and linkage to the financial
management system.  Accounts transactions will be generated through the implementing
agencies, processed in the PMU Project Accounting system, and processed through Treasury for
payment, under streamlined procedures. In IAM-2, it is proposed that implementation will be
taken over by the Director of each agency and coordinated by a Project Implementation Unit that
reports to the Project Steering Committee.
Criteria For Moving To The Second Phase (IAM-2)
15.  The following eight key criteria are being adopted as triggers for progressing from IAM-I
to IAM-2:
a)    Faleolo Intemational Airport operation has increased degree of compliance with
ICAO standards (notably, by relocation of the control tower and fire station), and
satisfies all applicable ICAO standards at December 2000.
b)    SAA level of cost recovery based on full costs (including economic depreciation
of replaceable assets) increased from the baseline as of June 30, 1998 by a
minimum of five percent increase in the level of cost recovery (Baseline value to
be established during IAM-1).
c)    Road Sector Plan (RSP) endorsed by Cabinet and cleared by WPA.
d)    PWD financial and cost accounting systems fully operational.
e)    PWD new asset manager and policy role and functions endorsed by Cabinet and
cleared by IDA and AusAID.
f)    DLSE reform plan endorsed by Cabinet and cleared by IDA.
g)    Asset inventory, topological maps, and coastal hazard information at least 60%
complete and publicly available.
h)    Participation in the Coastal Infrastructure Management (CIM) strategy,
comprises: a) at least three districts with CIM Plans being developed after
effective community consultation, education and awareness-raising; and b)
effective implementation in at least one of the Districts.
16   The progress on these and other performance indicators will be measured and reported in
the first instance by the PCM, monitored and evaluated by the IAMP Project Manager (1PM) and
Steering Committee, and reported in the quarterly Project Progress reports. Compliance with the
trigger criteria will be assessed by the three financing agencies (GoS/Treasury, IDA, AusAID),

Annex 12: Environmental Analysis: Executive Summary
Background
1.    An environmental analysis (EA) of the issues and mitigating actions regarding the proposed Infrastructure
Asset Management Program (IAMP) was conducted. The project will be financed for the Government of Samoa
(GoS) by the International Development Association (IDA) and AusAID. The EA was one of the project preparation
requirements of the World Bank, as set out in Operational Directive (OD) 4.01 and the primary GoS environmental
legislation, the Lands, Surveys and Environment Act, 1989.
2.    The analysis was undertaken by a combined government and consultant team in July - August 1998 and
finalized, after GoS review and feedback, in November 1998.
3.    The purpose of the study was to:
* Identify and assess the environmental issues associated with the project;
* Indicate any adverse environmental impacts of the proposed activities; and to
* Evaluate the need for further in-depth studies, reviews and environmental mitigation plans under the project.
Project and Program Highlights
4.    Environmental Management: The key elements of environmental management that are considered to be
important under the project are:
a)    Application of site specific environmental assessment procedures to each sub-project.
b)    The development and application of Codes of Environmental Practice (COEP) that will set minimum
standards and describe good environmental management practice for routine design, construction and
maintenance activities.
c)    Training, education and mentor support to be provided to sub-project proponents (e.g. PWD and
SAA), private sector consultants, contractors and DLSE to assist them carry out their respective roles
in environmental management.
d)    Recognizing that the coastal zone is an environmentally sensitive area in Samoa, the project
incorporates:
*  the preparation of Coastal Hazard Zone Maps that will identify areas vulnerable, and the degree of
sensitivity, to the effects of coastal storm hazards; and
*  the development of a Coastal Infrastructure Management Strategy (CIMS) leading to the development
and application of location specific Coastal Infrastructure Management Plans (CIMPs) supported by
extensive government, public and village community consultation, and public awareness raising and
education programs.
e)    Undertaking sub-project specific monitoring to ensure compliance with any conditions of consent
arising from the environmental assessment procedures, and more general environmental monitoring to
develop baseline information and changes to the baseline in the long term.
5.    Procedures for the implementation of the EIA process are described later in this executive summary and in
more detail in section 3.1 (see full report). The procedures are practicable and customized to the needs of different
types of sub-projects, ranging from those with no or negligible environmental impacts that will be adequately covered



Project Appraisal Document                Page 71                   Title: Infrastructure Asset Management Project
Country: Samoa
by the COEP, to those involving significant potential impacts requiring formal EIA assessment and independent
review.
6.    It is recommended that the draft EIA Regulation procedures be adopted for all works under IAM- 1 except that
the provisions relating to the Environment Board, Ministerial consents and Penalties should not apply. For the
purposes of the project, it is recommended that Ministerial Consents under the draft EIA Regulations be issued by the
Director DLSE, and that matters intended to be handled by the Environment Board, and top level enforcement of the
regulations, be handled by the IAMP Steering Committee.
7.    Recognizing that DLSE and proponents such as PWD will need time to develop the skills and resources
necessary to effectively meet the EIA requirements, it is recommended that:
a)     DLSE and all government sector proponents (e.g. PWD, SAA) will meet the full requirements of the
draft EIA Regulations (except as noted above) for all works under the project by the end of the second
year of LAM- 1;
b)    DLSE and all government sector proponents involved will meet the full requirements of the draft EIA
Regulations (except as noted above) for all works under their respective departmental budgets by the
end of the third year of lAM- 1;
c)     Fulfillment of (i) and (ii) above be conditions for the continuation of the works under IAM-2.
8.    Codes of Environmental Practice (COEP): In order to improve the environmental management of all publicly-
financed works, in the planning, design and implementation stages, a set of codes of good practice (COEP) for civil
works and services is being introduced during project preparation. Since the environmental category rating of B
depends on these standard operating procedures being in place for the Project works, the COEP should be introduced
and implemented before the first phase works begin - thus the introduction of the COEP should be made a condition of
effectiveness.
9.     The COEP needs to be consistent with the draft EIA Regulations. The COEP need to be presented in a manner
that is not too prescriptive so that professional judgement can be applied to site specific situations.
10.    Specific Sub-project EIA:  The COEP is the general basis for identifying, designing and constructing
developments within certain terrain's or environmental settings, and regarding specific activities. Some works will
require an Environmental Mitigation Plan (EMP) to take cognizance of the particular values or sensitivities of the
setting in which the works are proposed where these are not adequately covered by the COEP. The preparation of such
plans is the responsibility of the proponent for each component of work should be an integral part of the normal design
process. The effectiveness of any environmental impact 3mitigation measures will be independently evaluated and
tested in accordance with the draft EIA Regulation procedures.
11.   Coastal Infrastructure Management Strategy (CIMS): Developed and implemented under the Project, the
CIMS will include appropriate procedures for preservation of environmental assets, integrated and environmentally
sustainable planning and management of infrastructure assets, and procedures for consultation and local participation,
all embedded in an appropriate institutional framework. The development and implementation of the CIMS and
associated Coastal Infrastructure Management Plans (CIMPs) will be supported by public and village sector
consultation, education and awareness raising.
12.   Knowledge Base: The accessibility of environmental information will be enhanced through the installation of
an GIS-based information system. Coastal Hazard Zone surveys will be completed covering the entire coastline.
These surveys will be supported with aerial photography, preparation of up-to-date topographical maps also available
in GIS form that can be adapted to a variety of uses by a number of government departments. Guidelines will be
prepared on good practice for the selection, design and construction of coastal defense (hard and soft), as well as a
summary of EIA procedures, use of the COEP, economic evaluation and other procedures. These guidelines will refer
to, and sit along side, other internationally recognized or locally established good practice manuals (e.g.



Project Appraisal Document                 Page 72                  Title: Infrastructure Asset Management Project
Country: Samoa
"Environmental Impact Assessment in Samoa: A Practice Guide for DEC Officers"). Implementation of the guidelines
will be supported by training and information seminars delivered to project staff, private sector consultants and
contractors.
Environmental Description
13.   Environmental assessment of sub-projects is proposed to be undertaken in accordance with the procedures set
out in the draft EIA Regulations. These regulations have been developed as an output from the Cabinet approved
National Environment and Development Management Strategies (NEMS), but have not yet been officially endorsed.
14.   The environmental assessment procedures, comprising a cascaded screening of potential impacts, are
summarized in the figure below. Three types of sub-project are visualized for the purposes of environmental
assessment, each requiring a different level of investigation, reporting and independent review reflecting the
significance of the potential impacts, as follows:
a)    Sub-projects that have no, or low, adverse environmental impacts may be waived from the further
requirements of the draft EIA Regulations. Ordinarily the COEP will be adequate to cover the
environmental management requirements on such projects.
b)    All other sub-projects will be subject to environmental assessment.  This commences with a
Preliminary Environmental Assessment Report (PEAR) that is prepared by the proponent. The project
may proceed if, after review, the Director DLSE concludes there are will be no significant adverse
environmental impacts.
c)    Projects for which there are potential significant adverse environmental impacts will be subject to a
full EIA process. The EIA, prepared by the proponent, must consider altematives and mitigation
measures. The EIA is reviewed by DEC. Affected communities must be consulted and there may be
formal public meetings. DEC may request further information and, if approving the works to proceed,
may set special conditions that must be met by the proponent.
These procedures are presented diagrammatically in the following figure.
15.    The draft EIA Regulations require proponents to consult with and keep informned any local communities
affected by the sub-projects. The draft EIA Regulations emphasis early communication between the proponent and
DEC to ensure that procedures are streamlined. The Regulations also require DEC to prepare and publish guidelines
on EIA procedures to proponents.
16.   Because the draft EIA Regulations are not yet enacted by Cabinet, a number of features in the Regulations
cannot realistically be adopted (e.g. Ministerial approvals, functions of the Environment Board, and application of
penalties). For the purposes of the IAM Project, suitable altemative delegations for these aspects have been suggested
that keep the actions within the IAMP team.

Note 1: Projects that have a classification of B in terms of the World Bank Operational Directive 4.01 may still require an EIA
under the draft EIA Regulations. This is likely to be the case for most seawall and coastal defense systems.
Monitoring
18.    Two areas of monitoring will need to be established in support of environmental management as follows:
a)     Monitoring on sub-projects to ensure that the scope of works does not differ from the scope that was
approved under the draft EIA Regulations, compliance with any COEP provisions or conditions of
EIA approval. In some instances appropriate baseline environmental information may need to be
gathered and submitted with the EIA. Such preparatory monitoring should be identified in the
implementation plan for the sub-project. This will permit the evaluation of impacts over time
compared with baseline data.
b)     Critical areas such as the coastal hazard zone should be monitored to identify the long-term trends of
natural processes and so quantify changes in the baseline conditions.
Institutional Arrangements
19.    The draft EIA regulations clearly set out the steps and who is responsible for each stage of the environmental
assessment process, including the proponent, regulator and oversight functions, viz:
a)     Proponents of a sub-project such as PWD, SAA (or a private developer when the EIA Regulations are
passed into law) are responsible for liaising with and informing DLSE, preparing all environmental
assessment submission documents, developing mitigation measures and alternatives, and ensuring
affected communities are consulted and informed.



Project Appraisal Document                Page 75                   Title: Infrastructure Asset Management Project
Country: Samoa
b)    The Regulator, DLSE, is responsible for independently reviewing an application for environmental
assessment and giving the appropriate approval or not, as the case may be, or referring the application
to a higher stage in the EIA process.
c)     Oversight to the whole process is provided from the Minister LSE (who has the ultimate responsibility
for EIA approvals) and the Environment Board (who deal with appeals).
20.   Neither the PWD and SAA as proponents, and DLSE as regular, currently have the institutional strength to
undertake all aspects of the EIA process as contemplated under the draft Regulations. It is recommended that PWD
and DLSE enter into an understanding, perhaps expressed through a Partnering Agreement, committing each to an
increasingly higher level of achievement of the EIA requirements, identifying progress milestones against an agreed
time frame within two years.
21.   A high level of expectation will also be placed on private sector consultants, and on construction contractors,
to implement environmental management practices. Training and support on environmental management practices and
procedures will be provided during IAM-1 with the appointment of a Coastal Engineering/Environmental Adviser
attached to the Project Management Unit (PMU).
Consultation
22.   Under the draft EIA Regulation proponents are responsible for consultation with, and keeping informed, all
communities affected by each sub-project development. The Director DLSE is responsible for arranging a public
meeting for the purpose of facilitating public involvement in the EIA process for those sub-projects that are deemed to
potentially have significant adverse environmental impacts.
23.   Consultation with Village Fonos will generally need to be done through the services of a Talking Chief and
will involve ceremony and the exchanging of gifts. The Ministry of Internal Affairs will also have a role to play in this
process, especially in their relationship with the Pulenu 'u representing the Village and through whom consultations
may commence.
24.   The development of a CIMS and CIMPs, to be undertaken by DLSE, will involve extensive village
consultation in up to three districts as part of IAM-I. These sub-projects will also involve public education and
awareness raising that will be implemented through public meetings, the distribution of pamphlets and booklets, and
advertising through the newspaper, radio and television.
25.   A framework for consultation with stakeholder, including village communities, is set out in the parallel social
assessment study by O'Meara (1998). A significant amount of lead time will be required for such consultation for
project planning as well as environmental assessment purposes.

Annex 13: Financial Management, Accounting And Reporting
Capability Of Executing Agencies
I.    The implementing agencies were reviewed to assess their capabilities in financial management and accounting,
and ability to comply with the IDA reporting requirements.
Samoa Airport Authority (SAA)
2.     The SAA is a wholly-owned government corporation which is operated in a commercial manner. At the
moment, the accounting transactions are being processed on a manual basis. Because of the absence of a computerized
accounting system, significant time is incurred in processing the related accounting infonnation. This is especially
evident for the payroll processing function where there are approximately 198 employees. Previous efforts in
introducing computerized accounting software (i.e. Attache 5) have been restricted by a lack of staff skills. Currently
there is also no back-up for the Chief Accountant which presents a risk to continuity of accounting practice.
3.    The audit reports of the SAA annual accounts for the years ended 30 June, 1997 and 30 June, 1998 have not
been completed, although both audits are expected to be completed by June 1999. Accordingly, for its own future
requirements and for adequate project accounting requirements, SAA needs a computerized accounting package which
is year 2000 compliant and just as important, the related training and support for such an application. As an interim
measure, a spreadsheet model could be designed to capture the project transactions as well as produce the required
project reports. This however, would require time for additional training and suitable systems to be developed in time
for the targeted IAMP implementation date of February 1, 1999. The SAA Business Improvements services under
IAM-I will upgrade the SAA financial management and accounting systems, including other business processes, by
early 2000. Thus, an interim procedure is required for the IAM-I Project transactions.
Department of Lands, Surveys and Environment (DLSE)
4.     DLSE is a government department which does not have its own computerized accounting system but is
integrated with the Treasury Department's procedures for the capturing of accounting transactions. The DLSE
accounts section is sufficient for the purposes that they were set up for, i.e. to initiate and approve the disbursement of
public funds in accordance with specified targets or budgetary allocations. They neither have the experience,
qualifications nor the existing manpower resources to carry out any additional accounting duties involving producing
computerized reports of expenditure for any project involving a significant amount of money with strict reporting
deadlines and with a specified reporting format. The IAM-1 Project includes only an initial institutional analysis of
DLSE and not any substantial reform activity, thus a FM and accounting procedure is required for the full period of the
Project.
Public Works Department
5.    The standard PWD accounting procedures are similar to those of the DLSE, that is manually processed
transactions with no separate computerized accounting system. As for all Government departments, payments,
accounting and reporting are all done by the Treasury Department. The staff in the Accounting section for the Public
Works Department however are more qualified, and monitoring activities are also stronger, than in DLSE. Under
previous AusAID assistance through the PWD Interim Assistance Project (PWD-IAP), a computerized financial and
costing system was established. This process established a comprehensive chart of accountsand inventory of activities
so that tasks and outputs could be costed. The system was more detailed than Treasury's TCS financial accounting
system, so the links to Treasury could not be automatic. The Treasury TCS accounting system was subsequently
modified to include the task-level accounting to be compatible with the PWD financial and costing system.
6.    Under the PWD Institutional and Technical Services in the IAM-1 Project, the financial management and
accounting systems will be upgraded and made fully operational by mid-2001, since sound financial management
capability is one of the prerequisites for PWD to move towards statutory authority status. Thus, interim measures for
the duration of IAM-I will be needed for the Project accounting. Suitable arrangements will also have to be made to



Project Appraisal Document                Page 77                   Title: Infrastructure Asset Management Project
Country: Samoa
ensure that one of the two key accounting supervisors can devote the necessary time to the project without serious
disruption to the Department's considerable nonnal accounting obligations.
7.    The accounting review made an observation on the audit documentation verification procedures for the IDA-
funded Emergency Road Rehabilitation Project which closed in December 1997. The examination of supporting
documents was made on photocopied documents of the originals. It is recommended that the final audit for the ERRP,
namely FY98 which is due March 31, 1999, be performed on the original copies of the supporting documentation once
the final FY98 project accounts have been prepared.
Treasury Department
8.    A preliminary review of the Treasury Department's expenditure processing procedures shows adequate
internal controls. The Treasury Department does have the qualified personnel and the existing computerized
accounting programs to undertake the project accounting function itself as an implementing agency. However,there
are concerns about performance, evident through delays in expenditure processing and in producing timely financial
reports, which reflect in part prevailing staff vacancies and staff demands. Treasury themselves have determined that
they do not have the spare capacity to handle all the IAM- 1 Project accounting.
9.     Since Treasury must process foreign exchange payments under the Credit and will be ultimately responsible
for the Project accounts and audits, the performance issues must be addressed. For example, the expenditure cycle
which involves the requisition voucher (TYI- I form) and the payment voucher (TYI-2 form), goes through at least six
different people who perform six different functions within the Treasury Department before a check is finally signed
and ready for payment of goods or services. This does not include a similar process at the government department
level where the vouchers go through at least 3 different people before being forwarded to the Treasury Department.
Thus, for the IAMP, the transaction process or the 'number' of 'stops' needs to be reduced from the initiation of the
contract payment to finalization of the payment to the contractor. In this case it would be better if approval procedures
were left to the individual implementing agencies themselves and the Treasury Department's role would be to simply
process the payment as efficiently as possible without any further approval functions to be performed. This would be
in line with the Treasury Department's policy of devolution and decentralization of accounting functions.
10.   Under the existing accounting systems, there have been delays in producing public accounts, although action is
now being taken to bring these accounts up to date as part of the comprehensive institutional strengthening and reform
of Treasury which has been underway for three years. The accounts up to the year ended June 30, 1995 have been
presented to Parliament, and it is expected that the accounts for the years FY96, FY97 and FY98 will be presented in
1999. This has also caused related delays in completing the audits of the public accounts.
Overall conclusion
11.   Given the issues noted above for each of the implementing agencies, the financial review recommended that
the primary accounting function for the first phase IAM-1 project expenditures be performed by the Project
Management Unit. The implementing agencies would be responsible for approving the primary vouchers at the point
of initiation, and the project accountant in the PMU would be responsible for accumulating, capturing in the Project
accounting system, summarizing and reporting all project transactions incurred by each of the implementing agencies.
This would ensure that the Project accounting function would be dedicated solely to the accounting of project costs and
not to any other departmental matters. Furthermore, this will ensure that the Bank's reporting and auditing
requirements will be achieved, i.e., that project reports be prepared on a quarterly basis and that the audits be
completed within six months of the end of the fiscal year.
Proposed project accounting transaction process
12.   An IAMP accounting procedures transaction process flowchart was designed by the Treasury Department and
the Project team (Figs. I and 2) - this depicts the flow of project expenditures which begins with the contractor and
flows through to the Treasury Department. The proposed system streamlines the normal transactions procedures with
the intention of minimizing processing delays and the duplication of checking.

Country: Samoa
13.    The Project accounting, monitoring and reporting procedures will be adapted progressively to the Bank's new
LACI standards with the aim of achieving the reporting requirements of PMR by June 2001. A time-bound action plan
for this was agreed at negotiations, as shown in Table A13-1. The progress will be reviewed annually, and the intent is
for the second phase project, IAM-2, to be eligible for PMR-disbursements.

(d)  Production of simplified Project Management Reports  June 30, 2001
conforming with Section 4.02 (a) paragraphs (i), (ii) and
(iii), beginning with the period April I to June 30, 2001.
14.    Transactions Process:  (i) Contractor invoices are submitted to the IA, (ii) reviewed by the designated
'Engineer' and/or the IA-PCM, (iii) checked by the IA accounting division, (iv) authorized by the IA Director, (v)
submitted to the PMU Project accountant, checked and entered into the Project Accounting System (PAS), (vi)
submitted by the PA to Treasury Finance Division for payment by one of three methods, i.e. (a) payment in local
currency through Treasury Accounts Division, (b) in foreign currency from the USD or AUD Special Accounts
maintained as Imprest accounts in Central Bank of Samoa, or (c) direct withdrawal application to IDA for sums not
less than $100,000; (viii) payments in local made through the PA and foreign currency payments made direct and
copied to the PA to ensure recording in the PAS.
15.    Project Accounting System  (PAS):   A dedicated PAS is being established in February 1999 using a
commercially available software package, MTXlMillennium, adapted to produce IDA reporting requirements for
financial and procurement statements initially, and ultimately all PMR reports. The five standard reports meeting IDA
requirements are shown in the FMA report on the Project File. The funds are related to Project activities through a
unique procurement code referenced to the Project design, e.g., B!.0202.01 (aa.bbcc.dd) comprising the Project sub-
component (aa), subproject (bb) and contract (cc) codes, with an extension designating the transaction.
16.    Special Accounts: Two special accounts will operated by Treasury in the Central Bank of Samoa: (i) in USD
for IDA funds, and (ii) in AUD for AusAID grant funds. Treasury will prepare the reconciliations of the bank and
imprest accounts.
17.    Audit: The review recommended that the PA retain the originals of vouchers and progress claims to support
the entries and transactions in financial reports for audit purposes. The Treasury wishes to manage the storage and
access to these original documents in a secure environment in line with procedures for all Departments, and make them
available to the auditor. Facilities for control checks will be provided on a random basis, and the PA will provide for
access by each IA and treasury to the financial reports generated by the PA. A full audit will be conducted annually
and, in deference to Treasury's request for time to reach the new IDA standards, audit reports will be required within
six (instead of four) months of the ending of the fiscal year. An independent auditor will be selected from a short list
to be cleared with IDA.

Country: Samoa
Annex 14: Public Works Department Restructuring:
Executive Summary
Project Origin
1.    Public Sector Reform: The SES for 1998-1999 states the Government's view that successful implementation
of public sector reform is a prerequisite for the growth of the private sector, and that a healthy and competitive private
sector is a key to sustained national economic growth. The GoS has recognized that its large and inefficient public
sector is a structural weakness, and sees its role as creating an enabling environment to allow businesses to grow and
prosper. In the Vision Statement, GoS seeks to lead the region in structural and public sector reform. The key aspects
of the Public Sector Reform process include:
* "Strengthening the partnership between the public and private sectors
* Redefinition of role and responsibilities ofpublic service
*  Prioritization andfocusing of Government services
*  Corporatisation/privatisation program to reduce Government's direct involvement in commercial
enterprise activities
*  Refinement ofperformance budgeting
*  Improve Government accounting to support delegations offinancial controls and devolved personnel
management functions to line departments
*  Further development of strategic/corporate planning in line departments, and
* Contracting out of services "
2.    PWD Institutional Strengthening: There have been three recent initiatives for institutional strengthening of
PWD. The Interim Assistance Project (IAP) supported by AusAID until 1995 introduced contract procedures, a
computerized job-costing system and other assistance. Two institutional studies financed under the IDA Emergency
Road Rehabilitation Project (Cr. 2132-WSO) (PWDIS-1 in 1996 and PWDIS-2 in 1997), analyzed the options for
reform of PWD and designed a program for implementing reform. The first study recommended that PWD become a
statutory authority in the medium- to long-term, and in the short-term gradually increase the amount of works and
services outsourced to the private sector. After review, the Cabinet decided that PWD would remain a department in
the short-term until the necessary financial management and experience in asset management had been developed.
The second study analyzed the PWD functions in detail and developed an implementation plan. The chosen plan
involved substantial restructuring of PWD, a phased privatization of non-core functions and assets, a phased transfer of
staff to the private sector, and further increased outsourcing to the private sector. This plan included privatisation of
the Mechanical Workshop, Plant Pool, Alafua Quarry and Asphalt Plant. Thus, PWD would be transformed into a role
of asset manager with a monitoring and regulatory function and a strongly reduced role in the direct provision of
works. Later, when the necessary financial systems were established and performance requirements were being met,
the government would reconsider the long-term preferred option for corporatizing PWD as a statutory authority.
Meanwhile, PWD has been embarking on the reform program through its internal resources and a good program of
internal consultation.
PROJECT DESCRIPTION
Approach
3.    Implementation of the reformns by PWD will be assisted by specialist institutional and technical advisory
services (PWD-ITS) under the Infrastructure Asset Management Project, cofinanced by IDA and AusAID, beginning
June 1999. As a result of the internal discussions, the PWD-ITS will help PWD define more explicitly the changes
which are justified, how they are to be introduced, and to stage the implementation progressively over a period of
several years. The present PWD-ITS project will operate over 2.5 years under the first phase of the IAMP, i.e. IAM- 1.
Two stages are proposed, (a) Stage I for 18 months to design details of the proposed changes and plan; and Stage II for



Project Appraisal Document                Page 81                   Title: Infrastructure Asset Management Project
Countiy: Samoa
12 months to begin implementation. In order to ensure that the direction and pace of change are appropriate to the
emerging business and traditional values of modem Samoa, the reform process will be led and guided by experienced
and senior Samoan officials, within and beyond the department itself. The working team would report to a
Government-appointed Steering Committee, comprising senior public servants, private specialists and the leader of the
lAM Program. Working Parties, under guidance by the Director of Works and made up of Samoans supported by
other expertise, would address strategic analysis and planning, organizational and management issues, commercial
practice in the engineering profession and engineering costing and contracting together with short term assistance in
legislative drafting skills, employee performance and remuneration and skills training in business and performance
based management, short term overseas placements, and overseas familiarization visits.
Goal, Purpose and Objectives
4.     The goal of the IAM project is: to improve the provision, management and maintenance of road infrastructure
and other public works and services.
5.    The purpose of the PWD-ITS project is to strengthen the Public Works Department and the civil engineering
private sector and to establish systems that make effective and efficient use of the human and financial resources
available for the provision, management and maintenance of roads, public works and services.
6.     The specific objectives for the short-term (1 - 3 years) are:
* To specifically define and have endorsed the role, functions and activities of the Public Works
Department;
- To implement financial systems to support the Public Works Department and the Treasury in meeting
their respective objectives;
l To complete the strategic and business planning and the commercial aspects of refocusing Public
Works;
* To implement the constitutional, legislative and machinery of government aspects of establishing the
new Public Works Department;
* To commence a program to change the culture of the Public Works Department and to develop its
human resource capacity to meet the other objectives;
* To improve the systems for physical and financial management of infrastructure and service provision
and to make efficient and effective use of the available resources;
* To support the development of a competitive private sector in the construction and maintenance of
infrastructure; and
* To develop an environmental planning framework to improve the management of environmental
issues within the Public Works Department.
7.     After the initial period of consolidation and strengthening in the short term under IAM-I, the medium-term
objectives under IAM-2 will be to:
* consolidate the gains made during the first three years;
* identify and address the weaknesses and failures that arose during the first three years;
* continue to enhance and improve the asset management systems;
* improve the monitoring and evaluation of contractor performance;
* support further private sector participation in the sector,
Issues
8.     There are important social and cultural issues which will have an impact on the project. Thematai system
means that prospective changes will be considered thoroughly for their impact on people; there will be caution about
the pace of change and concem about the impact of the transfer of functions to the private sector. These matters
remain even though reforms have been under discussion since 1992. The proximity of an election, due in 2001, may
increase the interest in the probable consequences of the project.



Project Appraisal Document                  Page 82                    Title: Infrastructure Asset Management Project
Country: Samoa
9.     Environmental issues are an issue. Substantial environment work is associated with the IAMP. A component
of this project is to strengthen Public Works so that the work done and the lessons learned are incorporated into Public
Works in a long lasting and sustainable manner.
10.    Employment, discrimination and gender issues need to be addressed by the Director and the Steering
Committee in Stage One of the project. These should include matters such as the conditions of employment, the
structure of selection and recruitment panels, career development, and emerging matters such as sexual harassment.
Implementation
Stage One
11.    The first stage of the project will consolidate the extensive work undertaken so far by Public Works in
implementing government policy on public sector reform. Internally, significant consensus has been reached on the
proper direction for Public Works and significant amounts of service delivery are now performed by the private sector.
This private sector participation will continue during IAM-I and will be supported by it so as to achieve sustainability.
The purpose of this phase is to consolidate the work of the current Public Works Department management, which has
progressed to the stage that detailed engagement of other agencies is required, especially Treasury and the Public
Service Commission.
13.    During the first six months Public Works will work prepare a detailed description of the new Public Work
Department showing clearly what it is envisaged the department will be doing in 18 months, three years and five years
time. This process will involve discussion and consultation with Ministers, Treasury, the Public Service Commission
and other stakeholders. It will be a open dialogue with information shared, options discussion, benefits quantified,
risks assessed, capacity issues addressed, contingencies and dependencies identified and solutions provided. The first
objective will be to agree what is the role of the Public Works Department in the 2 1't century. This will form the basis
for the functions and objectives to enshrined in the new Act.
14.    At the practical level it is Government policy to delegate and devolve to departments greater authority in
matters of finance and employment. The project team will have to discuss and document the specific levels of
delegation and devolution from Treasury and the Public Service Commission required by Public Works to enable it to
operate efficiently and efficiently.
15.    When this has been done, and the Minister is satisfied that the structure and procedures are robust and
sustainable, a Cabinet submission will be prepared seeking formal approval for the establishment of the new 'Public
Works' department.
16.    The Cabinet minute will:
*  provide the Minister, Public Works and the central agencies with the necessary authority to implement
this particular part of public sector reform; and
*  indicate the need for co-operation between all agencies on the development of policies to support the
directions set by Government.
17.    Very early in the project a communication plan will be prepared and actioned so that all stakeholders are kept
informed about the project. It will be difficult to be specific until Cabinet has endorsed a specific proposal but the
project sponsors must make serious efforts to manage communications effectively.
18.    During the second six months, after receiving Cabinet approval, the project will develop in detail:
*  a corporate plan for Public Works;
*  a work plan for the three year commencing I st July 2000;
*  organization structures for each business unit within Public Works;
*  a simple business plan for each business unit;
*  operating procedures for the financial and accounting systems;

* human resource requirements;
* position descriptions
* budgets of income and expenditure
* capital expenditure budget.
19.   During the third six months, the project will concentrate on implementing the work that was prepared during
the previous year. PWD will be preparing itself to operate as a department with various enterprise units to carry out
common functions.
20.   The Components and Outputs for this 18 month phase are:
Component 1: Inception
*  Output 1.1:   Development of Communications Strategy

*  Output 5.1:   Prepare Project Design for Stage 2
21.   During the completion of these activities an interlinking program of development and support for the private
sector must be undertaken. This will involve two aspects. Firstly, ensuring that PWD structures itself and its
processes to support the private sector (e.g. sound contracting practices, transparent awarding of tenders, adhering to
published engineering standards, publishing a annual works plan etc) and, secondly, by conducting seminars and
supporting the training of young Samoans as professionals in this sector.
Stage Two (Year 1.5 to 5)
22.   The likely main components of Stage Two will comprise new outputs together with a continuation of some
outputs from Stage One including:
* Continued training, and capacity-use and capacity-building in Public Works
* Provision of short term advisors to assist with specific aspects of achieving sustainability in
engineering, technical, operational, information technology aspects;
* Further financial management, accounting, and commercial capacity building;

* Introducing environmental management systems within PWD;
*  Developing information technology and management information systems policies, requirements and
practices;
* Completion of one or more short projects, identified early in Stage 1;
* Asset management - assistance to develop and maintain systems for asset management including
support for the proposed RAMS and AIMS systems;
* Contracts, tendering and contract supervision - the private sector has identified a need for Public
Works to strengthen its contracting systems and procedures, specifically that tender processes need to
be documented and made transparent, new pro forma bid documents prepared, new contractual
documents drafted and training be provided in bid evaluation and assessment;
* Further development of a transparent costing system so that where the private sector and PWD
compete for the provision of works and services a 'level playing field is provided" (currently there are
concems over the method of allocating all costs, especially capital costs, to prices); and
*  A program of long term training scholarships.
