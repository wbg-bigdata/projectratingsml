procedures consistent with those set forth in Sections I and II
of the "Guidelines for Procurement under IBRD Loans and IDA
Credits" published by the Bank in May 1992 (the Guidelines).
    (a)   For fixed-price contracts, the invitation to bid
referred to in paragraph 2.13 of the Guidelines shall provide
that, when contract award is delayed beyond the original bid
validity period, the successful bidder's bid price will be
increased for each week of delay by two predisclosed correction
factors acceptable to the Bank, one to be applied to all
foreign currency components and the other to the local currency
component of the bid price. Such an increase shall not be taken
into account in the bid evaluation.
    (b)   In the procurement of goods and works in accordance
with this Part A, the Borrower shall use the relevant standard
bidding documents issued by the Bank, with such modifications
thereto as the Bank shall have agreed to be necessary for the
purposes of the Project. Where no relevant standard bidding
documents have been issued by the Bank, the Borrower shall use
bidding documents based on other internationally recognized
standard forms agreed with the Bank.
Part B:   Preference for Domestic Manufacturers
    In the procurement of goods in accordance with the
procedures described in Part A.1 hereof, goods manufactured in
the Kingdom of Morocco may be granted a margin of preference in
accordance with, and subject to, the provisions of paragraphs
2.55 and 2.56 of the Guidelines and paragraphs 1 through 4 of
Appendix 2 thereto.
Part C:   Other Procurement Procedures
1.   Works and reforestation activities estimated to cost
the equivalent of $3,000,000 or less per contract, may be
procured under contracts awarded on the basis of competitive

bidding, advertised locally, in accordance with procedures
satisfactory to the Bank.
2.   Goods estimated to cost the equivalent of $400,000 or
less per contract, up to an aggregate amount equivalent to
$3,300,000, may be procured under contracts awarded on the
basis of comparison of price quotations obtained from at least
three suppliers eligible under the Guidelines, in accordance
with procedures acceptable to the Bank.
3.   Supplies estimated to cost less than the equivalent of
$50,000 per contract, up to an aggregate amount not to exceed
the equivalent of $8,000,000, may be procured under contracts
awarded on the basis of comparison of price quotations
solicited from a list of at least three suppliers eligible
under the Guidelines, in accordance with procedures acceptable
to the Bank.
4.   Contracts for veterinary drugs may be awarded after
direct negotiations with suppliers, in accordance with
procedures acceptable to the Bank.
5.   Small works in remote areas, up to an aggregate amount
not to exceed the equivalent of $2,000,000, may be carried out
under force account.
Part D:  Review by the Bank of Procurement Decisions
1.   Review of invitations to bid and of proposed awards and
final contracts:
    (a)   With respect to each contract for works estimated to
cost the equivalent of $1,000,000 or more, and each contract
for goods estimated to cost the equivalent of $500,000 or more
(except for veterinary drugs), the procedures set forth in
paragraphs 2 and 4 of Appendix 1 to the Guidelines shall apply.
Where payments for such contract are to be made out of the
Special Account, such procedures shall be modified to ensure
that the two conformed copies of the contract required to be
furnished to the Bank pursuant to said paragraph 2 (d) shall be
furnished to the Bank prior to the making of the first payment
out of the Special Account in respect of such contract.
    (b)   With respect to each contract not governed by the
preceding paragraph, the procedures set forth in paragraphs 3
and 4 of Appendix 1 to the Guidelines shall apply. Where
payments for such contract are to be made out of the Special
Account, said procedures shall be modified to ensure that the
two conformed copies of the contract together with the other
information required to be furnished to the Bank pursuant to
said paragraph 3 shall be furnished to the Bank as part of the
evidence to be furnished pursuant to paragraph 4 of Schedule 6
to this Agreement.
    (c)   The provisions of the preceding subparagraph (b) shall
not apply to contracts on account of which withdrawals are to
be made on the basis of statements of expenditure.
2.   The figure of 15% is hereby specified for purposes of
paragraph 4 of Appendix 1 to the Guidelines.
Section II. Employment of Consultants
1.  In order to assist the Borrower in carrying out the Project,
the Borrower shall employ consultants whose qualifications,
experience and terms and conditions of employment shall be
satisfactory to the Bank. Such consultants shall be selected in
accordance with principles and procedures satisfactory to the
Bank on the basis of the "Guidelines for the Use of Consultants
by World Bank Borrowers and by the World Bank as Executing
Agency" published by the Bank in August 1981 (the Consultant
Guidelines). For complex, time-based assignments, the Borrower
Page  12
shall employ such consultants under contracts using the
standard form of contract for consultants' services issued by
the Bank, with such modifications as shall have been agreed by
the Bank. Where no relevant standard contract documents have
been issued by the Bank, the Borrower shall use other standard
forms agreed with the Bank.
2.  Notwithstanding the provisions of paragraph 1 of this
Section, the provisions of the Consultant Guidelines requiring
prior Bank review or approval of budgets, short lists,
selection procedures, letters of invitation, proposals,
evaluation reports and contracts shall not apply to contracts
estimated to cost less than $100,000 equivalent each. However,
this exception to prior Bank review shall not apply to the
terms of reference for such contracts or to the employment of
individuals, to single source selection of firms, to
assignments of a critical nature as reasonably determined by
the Bank or to amendments of contracts raising the contract
value to $100,000 equivalent or above.
                                SCHEDULE 5
                          Implementation Program
A.  Institutional Arrangements
    MAMVA shall have overall responsibility for implementation,
coordination and supervision of the Project.
B.  Investment Program
1.  Beginning with Fiscal Year 1994, MAMVA shall: (a) not later
than October 31 in each Fiscal Year, prepare and furnish: (i)
for the Bank's review and comments, MAMVA's proposed
agricultural investment program for the following Fiscal Year,
together with information on external financing obtained
therefor; and (ii) for the Bank's review and approval, a
detailed description of activities to be carried out under Part
A of the Project, including, if applicable: (A) a technical and
economic evaluation of the said activities carried out in
accordance with guidelines satisfactory to the Bank; and (B) an
environmental assessment satisfactory to the Bank; and (b)
thereafter finalize the agriculture investment program taking
into consideration the Bank's comments thereon and take all
measures necessary to ensure its prompt implementation.
C.  Action Program
1.  (a)   The Borrower shall: (i) implement the Action Program
with due diligence and efficiency and at all times take all
necessary action to achieve the objectives thereof; and (ii)
prepare and furnish for the Bank's review and comments not
later than December 31 in each of its Fiscal Years a report, in
form and substance satisfactory to the Bank, on the progress
achieved in the carrying out of the Action Program.
    (b)   The Borrower shall, not later than October 31, 1995,
furnish to the Bank for its review and comments, a draft plan
of objectives, policies and actions designed to further the
efficiency and sound development of the Borrower's agricultural
sector and a timetable for its implementation during Fiscal
Years 1996 and 1997. Said plan shall be finalized during the
review which shall take place before December 31, 1995. During
such review, the tariffs applied by the Borrower on cereals
shall be examined.
    (c)   Notwithstanding the provisions of Schedule 1 to
this Agreement, if the Bank shall have reasonably considered as
unsatisfactory the progress made by one or several
Directorate(s) of MAMVA in carrying out the Action Program or
any part thereof, the Bank may withhold further approval of
commitments under its (their) respective Part(s) of the Project
Page  13
for the following Fiscal Years. The proceeds of the Loan
derived from such withholding could be reallocated to other
Directorate(s). Such withholding may continue until the
relevant Directorate(s) of MAMVA shall have taken remedial
action, satisfactory to the Bank, as shall be necessary to
achieve the objectives of the Project and ensure the successful
implementation of the Action Program.
2.  (a)   The Borrower shall introduce, not later than April 1,
1995, tariffs equivalent on all cereals which shall be lower
than, or equal to, the tariffs equivalent proposed by the
Borrower in its offer to the General Agreement on Tariffs and
Trade (GATT).
    (b)   Starting with April 1, 1996, and for the following
years, the Borrower shall put in place tariffs equivalent for
cereals whose maximum levels shall not exceed 90% of the
tariffs equivalent proposed by the Borrower to GATT for 1995.
    (c)   For each agricultural campaign, the Borrower shall put
into effect a fixed tariff. However, said tariff could be
corrected under certain circumstances such as:
          (i)   dumping;
         (ii)   major fluctuations of exchange rates; and
        (iii)   substantial price reductions on international
                markets.
    The Borrower shall keep the Bank informed of any tariff
change and provide the justification(s) thereof.
3.  The Borrower shall carry out Part B of the Project in
accordance with the Development Action Plan agreed between the
Borrower and the Bank. In particular, the Borrower shall ensure
that all investments financed by FDA under Part B.3 of the
Project meet at least one of the following objectives: (a)
introduction of new technology; (b) promotion of investments
with positive externalities; (c) provision of transitional
means for the Borrower to reduce its contribution to the
investment; and (d) transfer of income to the poorest farmers.
4.  The Borrower shall, not later than December 31, 1995, submit
to Parliament appropriate instruments for the deregulation of
the domestic marketing system for cereals (except bread wheat)
upstream of the mills, including elimination of licenses and
fixed margins for storage, transport and resale, and freedom
for mills to purchase from any operator.
                                SCHEDULE 6
                              Special Account

    (a)  the term "eligible Categories" means Categories
(1), (2), (3) and (4) set forth in the table in paragraph 1 of
Schedule 1 to this Agreement;
    (b)  the term "eligible expenditures" means expenditures in
respect of the reasonable cost of goods and services required
for the Project and to be financed out of the proceeds of the
Loan allocated from time to time to the eligible Categories in
accordance with the provisions of Schedule 1 to this Agreement;
and
    (c)  the term "Authorized Allocation" means an amount
equivalent to $12,000,000 to be withdrawn from the Loan Account
and deposited in the Special Account pursuant to paragraph 3
(a) of this Schedule.
Page  14
2.  Payments out of the Special Account shall be made
exclusively for eligible expenditures in accordance with the
provisions of this Schedule.
3.  After the Bank has received evidence satisfactory to it
that the Special Account has been duly opened, withdrawals of
the Authorized Allocation and subsequent withdrawals to
replenish the Special Account shall be made as follows:
    (a)  For withdrawals of the Authorized Allocation, the
Borrower shall furnish to the Bank a request or requests for a
deposit or deposits which do not exceed the aggregate amount of
the Authorized Allocation. On the basis of such request or
requests, the Bank shall, on behalf of the Borrower, withdraw
from the Loan Account and deposit in the Special Account such
amount or amounts as the Borrower shall have requested.
    (b)  (i)   For replenishment of the Special Account, the
                Borrower shall furnish to the Bank requests for
                deposits into the Special Account at such
                intervals as the Bank shall specify.
         (ii)   Prior to or at the time of each such request, the
                Borrower shall furnish to the Bank the documents
                and other evidence required pursuant to
                paragraph 4 of this Schedule for the payment or
                payments in respect of which replenishment is
                requested. On the basis of each such request, the
                Bank shall, on behalf of the Borrower, withdraw
                from the Loan Account and deposit into the
                Special Account such amount as the Borrower shall
                have requested and as shall have been shown by
                said documents and other evidence to have been
                paid out of the Special Account for eligible
                expenditures.
All such deposits shall be withdrawn by the Bank from the
Loan Account under the respective eligible Categories, and in
the respective equivalent amounts, as shall have been justified
by said documents and other evidence.
4.  For each payment made by the Borrower out of the
Special Account, the Borrower shall, at such time as the Bank
shall reasonably request, furnish to the Bank such documents
and other evidence showing that such payment was made
exclusively for eligible expenditures.
5.  Notwithstanding the provisions of paragraph 3 of this
Schedule, the Bank shall not be required to make further
deposits into the Special Account:
    (a)   if, at any time, the Bank shall have determined that
all further withdrawals should be made by the Borrower directly
from the Loan Account in accordance with the provisions of
Article V of the General Conditions and paragraph (a) of
Section 2.02 of this Agreement; or
    (b)   once the total unwithdrawn amount of the Loan allocated
to the eligible Categories, less the amount of any outstanding
special commitment entered into by the Bank pursuant to Section
5.02 of the General Conditions with respect to the Project,
shall equal the equivalent of twice the amount of the
Authorized Allocation.
Thereafter, withdrawal from the Loan Account of the
remaining unwithdrawn amount of the Loan allocated to the
eligible Categories shall follow such procedures as the Bank
shall specify by notice to the Borrower. Such further
withdrawals shall be made only after and to the extent that the
Bank shall have been satisfied that all such amounts remaining
on deposit in the Special Account as of the date of such notice
Page  15
will be utilized in making payments for eligible expenditures.
6.  (a)  If the Bank shall have determined at any time that
any payment out of the Special Account: (i) was made for an
expenditure or in an amount not eligible pursuant to paragraph
2 of this Schedule; or (ii) was not justified by the evidence
furnished to the Bank, the Borrower shall, promptly upon notice
from the Bank: (A) provide such additional evidence as the Bank
may request; or (B) deposit into the Special Account (or, if
the Bank shall so request, refund to the Bank) an amount equal
to the amount of such payment or the portion thereof not so
eligible or justified. Unless the Bank shall otherwise agree,
no further deposit by the Bank into the Special Account shall
be made until the Borrower has provided such evidence or made
such deposit or refund, as the case may be.
    (b)  If the Bank shall have determined at any time that any
amount outstanding in the Special Account will not be required
to cover further payments for eligible expenditures, the
Borrower shall, promptly upon notice from the Bank, refund to
the Bank such outstanding amount.
    (c)  The Borrower may, upon notice to the Bank, refund to
the Bank all or any portion of the funds on deposit in the
Special Account.
    (d)  Refunds to the Bank made pursuant to paragraphs 6 (a),
(b) and (c) of this Schedule shall be credited to the Loan
Account for subsequent withdrawal or for cancellation in
accordance with the relevant provisions of this Agreement,
including the General Conditions.
