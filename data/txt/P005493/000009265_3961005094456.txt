2'.    iBackground. iii rt-sponse to intereasinyv *cofniormc diiseqi ilibrta in inte intefrnlbl atnd external
accounts in ites earlv 1980s. Mlorocco enlxarkcd upon a MCed.iunm-Terini AgricUIltural Sector Adjustment
Program (M. rASAP) to support its ambl itious mediUm-termn program ol stabilization and adjustment.
As part of this prograrm, public investmems were cut to redujce the fiscal deficit and a number of
policy measures were taken to impro-ve the halance of payments. 'I'hc Government's reform program
has received the Bank's suppot thlirOLughl iwe" a /ia, two agricultura! sector adjustment loans (ASAL 1,
signed FY85. & ASAL St. signed FY874. two structural adjustment loans (SAL 1I signed FY89, &
SAL 1, signed FY092). and an agricultural secTor investment loan (ASIL 1. signed FY91).
3.     Progress undler die MITASAP was svery good. While agricultural growth was slow in the
1970s. averaging 2.4 percent p.a. in real terms, it rose to an average 8.2 percent annual real rate
between 1981-91 despite several drought years. This growth reflects the impact of the MTASAP's
improved incentives framework, as well as the growina iimpact of irrigation and adequate rainfall in
the non-drought years. This output growth was accompanied bh increases in agricultural exports
(3.2 percent in real termns on average between 1981 and 1991) and reductions in food imports (an
average of 1.2 percent p.a. in real terms over the same perio)d).
4.     Despite these achievements, challenges remain, in particular in achieving productive potential,
responding to changing economic circumstances, protecting natural resources, and alleviating poverty.
In light of the current circumstances, the Governiment and the Baiik have re-focused the goals for the
agricultural sector around four principal objectives: (i) increase sector efficiency, flexibility and
gtrouth by raising sector productivity, expanding the ability of farmers to respond to changing markets
and reducing risk: (ii) assure envirorunrictal trotection by maintaining, protecting, and developing the
natural re.- ource base, (iii) reduce povertl by expanding incomiie generating opportunities in rural areas
and directly addressing specific pockets of intense poverty; and (iv) r_define the role of the
Government by increasing reliance on the private sector and strengthening public administration
through greater accountability, decentralization and more efficiency.
5.     The Government aims to achieve these objectives by: (i' continuing to pursue the adjustment
program (deregulation and liberalization of domestic markets. ftirther opening of externa. trade
regime); (ii) increasing private investment (furtlher liberalization of the pricing framework, provision
of an adequate investment code and rural financial services, increased security of land tenure);
(iii) reducing and diversifying risks in the sector (greater use of improved crop varieties, expansion of
irrigation schemes and introduction of a calamity insuratnce scheme); (iv) enhancing responsiveness to
changing economic conditions (continued loosening of restrictions on cropping patterns, greater access
to services), (0) increasing incentives for more rational use of natural resources (higher irrigation
water charges, fees for use of communal lands); and finally (vi) more carefully selecting public
investments and improving the performance of current investments and publicly-provided services.
The Goverrment is committed to these objectives and fully ownls the adjustment program, as
demonstrated through its continued pursuit of the policy reform agenda in the agricultural sector, even
after closure of the Bank sector adjustment loans.



5.     Project Objectives. Although the Government's sector objectives are clear, resource
constraints limit the options for public intervention to pursue them. The principal need in the sector
is to select investments that further these objectives, but at the same time, to focus them into carefully
chosen areas where public sector involvement is well-justified or where thev can facilitate private
investments and private services. These investments need to be coupled with an action program that
also advances sector objectives and that is designed to make the investments more productive. The
principal objectives of the Loan are, therefore, (i) to provide a general resource transfer to the
agricultural sector in support of well-conceived public investment program by financing selected
investments in the budget of the Ministry of Agriculture, and (ii) to support deepening of
complemen:try sector reforms.
7.     Project Description. The overall project would encompass the entire agricultural investment
program of the Ministry of Agriculture for four years, 1994-97. It would be comprised of two
co-nponents: an investment program and an action program.
8.     The investment component would fund selected items in the budget of the Ministry of
Agriculture for 1994-97, with retroactive financing for the mouths in 1994 prior to Loan signing.
These include irvestments in: agricultural education, livestock, crop production, ,lant protection, land
policy programs, rainfed land improvements, forestry, extension, small- and medium-scale irrigation,
and planning. The Loan would also finance an Ag:icultural Development Fund (FDA) which
promotes private investrnents in: land improvements; irrigation improvements: increased use of small-
scale farm equipment; iivestock intensification; phytosanitary protection; and increaZed tree planting.
Irnvestment items to be financed under the proposed Loan were selected according to the following
procedures. First, they were screened to ensure that they were: (i) consistent with pursuit of sector
and subsector objectives; and (ii) not already financed by other donors or the Blank. Second, a more
detailed evaluation was then made usirg project summaries prepared by the Government to ensure that
investments conformed to accepted project selection criteria. Projects in this category with "high"
economic, social or environmental rates of return (generally above ten percent) and sound justification
for public intervention were then selected for financing under tuie proposed Loan.
9.     the action program would be comprised of reforms designed to improve the efficiency of
selected investments or operations in the sector, including: (a) liberalization of internal and external
trade; (b) reforms in the budget execution process; (ce reforms of the FDA; and (d) subsectoral
reforms (covering livestock, agricultural education and training, forestry and soil conservation, small-
and medium-scale irrigation, plant protection, extension, crop production, research, and land policy).
These subsector reforms focus on consolidation of the adjustment process (ircreasing the contribution
of beneficiaries to the costs of public services, reducing subsidies); private sector development
(outright privatization, greater incentives for private investment, education/training for the private
sector); improved public sector management (decentralization and improved operations at the field
level, improved inter-ministerial coordination, improved quality control); and envirorment and water
resource management (incentives for more rational use of forest resources, elimination of threat from
poorly stored hazardous agricultural chemicals, improved protection of rangelands).
10.    The ASIL 11 would also support the establishment of an Environmental Management Unit
(EMU) which would have the responsibility for undertaking environmental screening of projects,
arranging for environmental impact assessments when appropriate, and monitoring impact results
from investments.
1l.    Program Costs and Financing. The total project cost is equivalent to the Ministry of
Agriculture's overall investment program for the four years, 1994-97, and estimated at DH9435
million (IJS$993 million equivalent), of which some US$177 million is covered by donors (including
the Bank under other projects). The proposed ASIL 11 of US$121 million would finance just over



- 3 -
twelve percent of the investment budget of the Ministry of Agriculture for those years. CxCluding
taxes and duties. Retroactive financing of up to ten percent of the loan amount would hb provided
and would cover payments for eligible expenditures made during the months in 1994 precedling loan
signing. A breakdown of the cosls and the financipg plan are shown in Schedule A. Am,Iunts ;and
methods of procurerlient and of disbursements. and the disbursement schedule are shown ill ScheidiL
B. A timetable of key project processing events and the status of Bank Group operations irn fItrocco
are given in Schedules C and D respectively. A mzap is also attached, as is the Staff Arplalasl
Report, No. 12392-MOR and dated Ma!N 27. 1994.
12.    Project Implementation. The Ministry of Agriculture would have overall responsihbilBv for
project execution. The implementation of project investments. would be made by the various
directorates concerned. The Director of the Directorate of Planning and Economic Affairs (I)PAI-),
who is responsible for investment budget of the Ministry of Agriculture, would be the Project
Coordinator. Within budget envelope of the Miristrv of Agricuiture. he would ensure that project
priorities are respected in the annual allocation of budget funds and that project selection criteria
acceptable to the Bank are applied.
13.   Comprehensive annuai reviews ov the Bank and the Government would be undertaken as part
of the Loan. These reviews  ould take place each year at the time the draft budget is issued for the
subsequent year. A policy dialoL ue between the Bank and the Government on the overall action
program would also be held at that time, including discussion of progress on the measures detailed in
the Development Action Plan and accompanying matrix. The Government's proposed expenditures
for Bank financing in the subsequent year, based on the draft budget, would be examined and eligible
projects selected for incorporation intc the program. Financing for thu following year would depeDd
on agreement on project selection and compliance with the action program. The Bank's al!ocation of
Loan funds for subsequent years to individual directorates of the Ministry of Agriculture would be
contingent on progress achieved by those directorates in carrying out the reform program ror which
they have responsibility.
14.    Lessons Learned from Previous Involvement. The Moroccan Government is committed to the
reform process, but appreciates the support of the Bank to facil;tate policy change. A lack of
continuity in this support can lead to an interruption in the reform process. The ASAL I and ASAL
II did well in providing this support. While the SAL 11 and ASIL l made very important
contributions to the reform program. there were gaps in timing and coverage. A series of sequential
operations would be more useful. The PCR for the ASAL II stresses the need to view the reform
process as a long one. Individual loans should not be too ambitious, and should each be part of a
long-term effort for policy change. Thus the ASIL II would be the second of a series of sector
investment loans to the country. The ASIL I experience highliglhted the need to establish strong
institutional mechanisms for channeling Bank support to the multitude of actors involved in
implementing the Giovernment's overall investment budget. These mechanisms are being put in place
for the ASIL II.
15.   Rationale for Bank Involvement. Emphasis on agriculture sector investment loans (ASILs) is
a key feature of the sector assistance strategy for Moroccan agriculture'. This strategy calls for a
series of ASILs to serve as the major vehicle for policy discussion and for treatment of other sector-
wide issues as well as for financing critical investments in the sector. Stand-alone projects would be
reserved for those investments where extra technical assistance and/or project preparation/appraisal
skills are particularly needed.

16.   The endorsement of ASILs as an important lending instrument is based on the detailed
Agriculture Expenditure Review (AER), undertaken in 1990, which found the investment budget of
the Ministry of Agriculture (MAMVA)' to be generally satisfactory and worthy of Bank support.
This AER has been updated as part of the preparation for the proposed ASIL il and WLould he uipdated
again as subsequent ASILs are prepared. The Bank has unique experience in undertaking expenditure
reviews which it can bring to bear as a systematic part of the ASIL process to help Morocco further
develop, monitor, and evaluate its sector investment program.
17.   The proposed Loan would allow the Government and the Bank to build on cltOrts begun
under the ASIL I, most notably by continuing to improve the investment process, c.g., by
streamlining budget execution and strengthening procedures for project appraisal and project selection.
ASILs further provide an instrument foi the Government to maintain an on-going sector dialogue with
the Bank and give it an opportunity to receive support for continuing policy reforms, both of which
are strongly valued by the Moroccan Government. The ASIL 11 would permit a deepening of the
policy agenda, begun under the two ASALs and the SAL II, into specific, subsector issues that were
not addressed under the more sector-level adjustment loans. As such, it can be seen as an important
complement to those three loans. Finally, the ASILs provide funding for small, scattered, but
meaningful investments that would not otherwise benefit from external financing. In Morocco, this is
particuiaily crucial withl regard to investments in the rainfed subsector where the poorest in rural
areas tend to be found.
18.    Reletionshi to Bank Country Assistance Strategy. The proposed project fits well within the
Country Assistance Strategy for Morocco discussed at the Board on November 23, 1993 (see Report
No. P-6114-MOR). 'Ibis strategy stresses six pillars fcr the Bank's strategy: consolidaing the
adjustment and reform process, improving public sector management, fostering private sector
development, enhancing environmental and water resource management, alleviating poverty and
increasing the outward orientation of the economy. The ASIL II is specifically intended to further the
sector objectives discussed in para. 4. The sector objectives, and therefore the objectiv.es of the
Loan, are clearly consistent with these six pillars, and particularly emphasize consolidation of the
adjustment program, private sector development and improved public sector management.
19.   Agreed Actions. Government agreement has been obtained on the following priority actions
and issues. First, a set of improvements to the budget execution process have already been made.
Second, the Loan would support a series of measures to liberalize internal trade, including:
(i) obtaining approval by the Council of Government on mechanisms for the deregulation of the
domestic marketing system for cereals (except bread wheat), as a condition of effectiveness; and
(ii) submitting to Parliament a draft law for this deregulation by December 31, 1995. Third, the
Loan would s'iecify establishing an official environmental screening unit as a condition of
effectiveness. Fourth, the Loan would support improvements to the FDA program, including issuing
a reTulation - o permit the private sector to make certain investments (as a condition of effectiveness).
Finally, the Loan would support a number of steps to liberalize external trade, including
(i) introducing tariff equivalents less than or equal to the tariffs proposed under the GATr agreement
for all cereals by April 1, 1995; (ii) putting in place tariff equivalents less than or equal to 90 percent
of those proposed for 1995 under the GATT agreement for all cereals by April 1, 1996 and for
st'. equent years; and (iii) ensuring that these tariffs remain fixed except under certain circumstances.
The remaining actions supported by the proposed Loan would constitute an overall program which the
Governmnent has committed to carrying out. Progress on the program would be assessed during
annual reviews and fiuture commitments under the Loan would be subject to satisfactory
implementation of the action program. Funding for subsequent years would not be allocated to
'Me Ministzy of Agriculture and Agricultural Development (MAMVA) was formerly called the Ministry of Agriculture and
Agrarian Reforna (MARA).



directorates that have not adequately executed their programs, even if overall progress on the action
program is deemed satisfactory.
20.   Environmental Aspects. The proposed Loan has been classified as a Cate'.ory B project
since, overall, it would have limited environmental impact. No pesticides or herbicides would be
financed (aithough improved storage warehouses and safer application equipment would) and it is not
anticipated that there would be any resettlement issues from the land consoliddtion component. The
EMU established under the proposed Loan wouLld carry out environmental screening and to arrange
for environmental impact assessments when necessary. A base-line environmental screcning was
conducted by EMTEN to ensure that projects submitted for financing do not have any negative
impacts. This screening has determined that certain supplemental documr-n.ation would be required
for a small numnber of projects before disbursements could be made for the associated budgetary line
items. In any case, the effects of ASIL il are likely to be positive, especially in the areas of
reforestation, soil conservation, erosion control and better handling and disposal of agricultural
chemicals.
21.   Proiect Benefits. All of the investments selected for financing under the proposed Loan meet
a minimum ERR or other social or environmental objectives. The primary benefit of the investment
component is increased agricultural productivity and farm income. A number of investments promote
the conservation and protection of the natural resource base, especially the forests and the ranges. In
addition, the Loan would have significant equity benefits because all of the project investments go to
thn rural sector which accounts for 50 percent of the population and includes the majority of the
country's economically disadvantaged. The primary beneftt from the action program is increased
efficiency: efficiency of the investments themselves or efficiency in the allocation of resources in the
economy.
22.   Proiect Risks. One possible risk is that the Government would not make adequate budget
funds available for the selected investments during the project period. Overall budget levels for the
Ministry of Agriculture should be assured under the SAL II, reducing the possibiiity of this risk. In
the event of a shortfall, however, design of the ASIL II is flexible enough to permit substitution of
alternative investments meeting the selection criteria. There is also a risk that individual reforms in
the action program will not be implemented as agreed, however the overall program is very much
"owned" by the Government, particularly the subsector reforms and the status of these actions would
be carefully assessed and discussed with the Government as part of regular supervision and the annual
reviews.
23.   Recommendation. I am satisfied that the proposed Loan would comply with the Articles of
Agreement of the Bank and recommend that the Executive Directors approve the proposed Loan.
