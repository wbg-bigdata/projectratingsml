1.   Executive summary
The present document presents findings for the mitigation measures of the Environmental
Impact Assessment for the proposed alternative of Lezha-Shkodra Road located on the
northern-west area of Republic of Albania, and a part of the important North -South Road
Corridor, according to the ToR prepared by a WB staff and based on the Preliminary Design
prepared by I.T.P.
The aim of EIA is to ensure that the competent Authorities give exhaustive consideration to
the potentially negative and positive effects on the environment from implementation of the
proposed infrastructures at an early and preventive stage, in order to support the decision-
making process with the necessary information. The environment which will be affected by the
so-called target environment, should be regarded in its natural, economic and cultural-social
components, in order to have a holistic approach when addressing issues at stake.
The expected benificial and adverse impacts of the project are identified , predicted and
interpreted by comparison with environmental quality criteria and with existing conditions.
There are numerous techniques for the prediction of change in the environmental parameters:
the choise of method is detemined by the environmental parameters available, the time allotted
to analysis of data and the methods available to the study team. Prediction method is
qualitative.
The EIA also ensures that in case anticipated negative effects are unavoidable, ad hoc
mitigation measures are proposed and implemented during construction of the infrastructure.
In this context it is stressed that mitigation measures are an important component of design of
the road schemes and are related to standards on road traffic, safety, environmental and
economic terms.
The methodology adopted for carrying out the assessment consisted in field visits to the
location of the road to collect data, followed by office work to refine findings and write the
Report. Meetings with Albanian officials from GRD, the Ministry of Health, CEP, IMC and
the ITP staff have played an important part in the work executed.
The present document is organised according to the ToR, starting with project description, the
legal and institutional framework on the EIA context, the Albanian national environrmental
policy, baseline data on the study area, identification of potentially negative impacts, selected
solution, mitigation plans, suggestions for environmental management training, environmental
monitoring plan.

Project Description
The proposed Project concerns the construction of a new road (Lezhe-Shkoder) which is the
part of the North-South Road Corridor according to C.N.R Standard.
In the proposed option are taken into account the anticipated traffic growth, 13 % up to year
2000 and 10 % after year 2000 (up to year 2016, 20 years design life of the road) and also
technical conditions and local environmental parameters, the specific landscape of the related
area, and the fact that the road reduces much the distance (Lezhe-Shkoder).
The existing road has insufficient capacity for the expected future traffic. Traffic volumes
execs the so-called design capacity already today. There are provided four alternatives in
order to accommodate the projected traffic . The Alternative 0 provides only the routine and
partial reconstruction of the existing paved road; the Altemative 1 provides rehabilitation and
widening of the existing paved road, the alternative 2 provides the rehabilitation and widening
of the existing unpaved road ( because there is another road from Lezha to Shkodra,
constructed very long time ago and unpassable for the motor vehicles). The proposed Project
is alternative 3.
For the purpose of the EIA the road is devided into three section:
Section A    from km 0 (Lezha town) to km 6
Section B    from km 6 ( Balldrem area) to km 26 (Bushat area)
Section C    from km 26 to km 34.5 (Bacallek area)
In the proposed selection (alternative) , the road alignment passes in a flat terrain.
Along the sections A and C (the common road sections for all alternatives), the road
alignment follows the existing one, widening on the right side of it (the same for the all
alternatives). From km 6 to 26, in a length of 20 km, the road is provided to pass completely
on a new alignment respecting to all geometrical characteristics according to C.N.R Standard.
The road alignment passes through some populated areas on sections A and C . On section B
(new road) passes on some small communities. It crosses several times Drini and qadri rivers
and so that the construction of four big bridges are to be constructed respectively at km 25
(Plezha area); at km 7.0 (Gocaj); at km 6 (Kakariq) and km 14. Also the construction of two
overpasses (the first one is provided at km 0,500 where the road intersects the existing
railway) on Balldrem and Berdice (km 31,8) areas. Another intersection at grade is foreseen
where the road intersects Vau I Dejes. On that area exist a heavy drainage system that is to be
modified. The road area is also characterised by a high presence of ground water sources due
to the high level of rain falling and the geological formation. Along road section 3, on the
Bushat area, it is intersected with the discharged channel of the new Hydrocentral which is
planned to be constructed in the near future. The length of Section B (the new construction) is
of approx. 20 km. The road alignment in Section B crosses Zadrima field and intersects a
drainage channel. During the construction phase are also provided along the road to be set up
some new asphalt plants (or reconstruction of the existing ones) using updated technology and
located far from the road site (from 2 to 8 km far) and from populated areas ( on Lezha,
Kakariq, Kukel, Rrabosht). Also is to be set up some new borrow pits on Kallmeti area (km 7-
8), on Kakariq area (at km 6) etc. The work sites are provided to be set up on Kakariqi and
Plezha areas (1-2 km far from the road). At km 22 the road intersects a hill, so that the
construction of two deep cut is provided, destroying on this way the landscape of the area.

The alignrnent of the new road is shown in the Annex I
-Traffic composition: commercial vehicles traffic (trucks + busses) is 30 % and cars 55 %.
-Traffic density is about 5000 vehicles/day
The technical date concerning the Proposed Alternative:
length of the road section 34.5 km

3.    National Environmental Policy, legal and administrative framework current in
Albania and in conformity to which the EIA was prepared
The Albanian national policy for protection of the environment has been increasingly directed
at finding the proper measures to tackle the problem. To this end the Committee for
Environmental Protection (CEP) was created. The Committee comes within the Ministry of
Health & Environmental Protection. The Committee's headquarters is within the Ministry of
Health, with branches located in the capital towns of each national district (see Article 9,
Chapter 2 of Law NO 7664 of January 1993). One of these branches is located at Shkodra .
It is planned to strengthen the CEP in the near future so as to enhance its role in proposing
and enforcing measures aimed at environmental protection.
Although at present laws on specific matters of the environment have not been enacted yet,
the main reference in this regard can be represented by Law No. 7664 dated 21 January 1993
(hereinafter referred as the Law), enclosed as Annex II to the present document. The Law
refers to general clauses (Chapter 1), EIA (Chapter 2). With regard to the latter it is to be
noted that the present document points out that the Law identifies CEP as the Authority
empowered to require environmental impact assessments in accordance with that Law for this
type of intervention. However, the MoH is the authority responsible for establishing the
procedures regarding EIA activities and the activities of individuals or legal entities. Chapter
III deals with the licenses to be issued for activities that affect the environment, and a specific
list of said activities is presented. The Law then comprises Chapter IV (inspections
of and information for the environmental situation), Chapter V (duties and rights of central
and local institutions on environmental protection), Chapter VI (responsibilities and related
sanctions), and Chapter VII reporting final provisions.
However, it should be noted that the MoH from time to time issues documents of various
nature such as guidelines, provisions and regulations which also affect, the activities of CEP.
For this reason a complete review of relevant legislation is not possible, even if it is believed
that the Law can be taken as a benchmark.
Another law which is adopted in the execution of the ELA is the Law on expropriation,
required whenever any strip of land has to be expropriated for public purposes, Law No. 7848
dated 25 July 1994 and closed as Annex III to the present document. For the purposes of this
document the main provision is represented by the right to appeal for citizens (Chapter V)
against the expropriation of land. Here the owner of immovable properties has the right to
appeal to the district court within 60 days from the date of receiving notification (Articles 22
and 23). Following this, three experts are nominated for the appraisal of the property and the
amount due for compensation, and the deadline for presenting the appraisal of the property to
be expropriated is fixed. Two of the experts are nominated by the court and one by the owner
of the land.
Chapter V is the section of the law to which reference is made in case portions of land are
expropriated for the construction of the road. Chapter VI is section of relevant interest in our
case, as it addresses the temporary use of immovable property, which may be the case during
the execution of the envisaged works.
The legal framework is completed by Law No. 7968 dated 15 April 1993, which addresses the
restitution of land and compensation measures in the event portions of land have been or will
be expropriated . It is enclosed as Annex IV to the present document.

4.   Baseline data: assessment of the study area including description of the relevant
physical, biological and socio-economic conditions.
This paragraph outlines the information of the existing conditions of the project area
according to ToR prepared by WB.
Physical Environment:
The road alignment passes ona nearly flat terrain with and clay sand and sandy clay
formations which serve as a good goetechnical foundation ( with high bearing capacity) for
road bed and minor structures. The climateric condition (rainfall, snow, air temperature, wind
), and hydrological condition are reported in detail in the Hydrological Report.
Biological Environmental:
Generally the area where the new road is to be constructed does not bring any serious problem
from biological viewpoint. The road area, in Zadrima field represent a considerable human
settlement for agriculture purposes, so that there is a scarcity of biological diversity, which is
mostly represented by common animals and vegetal species. (See the map in Anex II ). The
pomegranate trees are the predominant fruit grown on the road area especially on Zadrima
field, and accompanied by the presence of Mediterranean shrub as Phillyrea latifolia; Salvia
officinalis; Pistacia terehintus; Phlomis fruticosa etj. There is a consistent popullation of
amphibias that use water environment (near by the edges of Drini and Gjadri rivers) for
breeding purposes.The mostly part of the road area is occupied by agricultural fields, mainly
under maize and other crops cultivations. No important coltures are grown on this road area.
The road alignment is provided crossing the rivers of Drini and Gjadri. The valleys of these
rivers serve as geographical border for the distribution of such species as Rana balcanika,
Rana dalmatina; Rana lessonal; Bufo bufo ; Emys orbicularis.
There are no important inhabited areas.
The main species spread out on this road area are:
Gitaret:
Crocidura suaveolens; Apodemus sylvoticus; Apodemus mystacinus; Mus musculis,
Pipistrellus sp; Phinolopus sp; Minopterus schrebersi; Mustela nivalis; Lutra lutra; Vulpes
vulpes; Lepus europeus.
Amphibia
Bufo bufo; Bufo viridis; Hyla arborea; Rana balcanika, Rana dalmatina; Rana lessonal;
Reptilia
Emys orbicularis, Natrix natrix; Natrix tessellata .
Social-Economic condition of the study
The proposed road area is mainly present a agricultural character and the popullation in
the sorrounding villages deal with agriculture and business activities. Crops are presented by
maize which is cultivated in farmed strips alternating to unfarmed ones. A part of the area is
7



left to extensive pasture for sheep and cattle, with present of animal breeding for family
puposes. Additional economic activities are presented by a number of scattered shops selling
goods of various nature. A part of resident popullation ( Balldrem, Torovice, Bisht Juge,
Bushat, Bacallek etc.) is imployed in economic activities in Lezha and Shkodra town.
The road alignment also provides the occupation of some lands and destroying a parcel of 100
ml covered with fruit trees (in Gocaj Village), another one of 150 ml (in Plezha village), but
the reduction of their production is not significant, because common cultivated in many places.
The land expropriation causes social disruption and economic loss for the affected families,
however these are acceptable (low negative impacts).
On the other hand, the construction of the new road help in development of the infrastructure
on that area will also have a big effect in social, business and economic development of that
area. The Lezhe-Shkodra Road is also the part of the North-South Road Corridor, the
construction of which has very big influence in developing of our economy. Also, it has a
positive effect on the area where a new Hydocentral is planned to be constructed in the near
future. Therefore, the population (farmers etc) on that road area support the project. Their
trouble are connected only with the use of the Compensation Law by the relevant Authorities
and GRD will secure that the owners are to be compensated before construction phase of the
road.
It is also important to emphasis that the new road construction will effect directly on the
management of the intemal traffic (regional traffic) on the Zadrima area where actually a
chaotic intemal traffic is present due to the lacking of the road linking traffic on different
directions on that area. This present situation effects negatively on social-economic activities
and creates artificially environmental impacts.

Environmental Impacts
This paragraph describe the quality identification of impacts for soil, water, air quality, flora &
fauna, noise pollution, land acquisition, resettlements, cultural heritage, road safety.

Soil contamination from runoff    X (4)
(1) There is no generation of this impact, as the road is located in a flat plain.
(2) This is in the case when top soil is utilised to create vegetation trips on the road slopes.
(3) If inert portions of soils will be spoiled, as they are neither utilisable for creating vegetation
strips, nor for cultivation purposes they constitute a "waste" generating negative impacts.
(4) This can be the case if water coming from the road surface is not collected in an
appropriate drainage system.
(5) This is due to road cutting I order to get the stability of the slopes.

(1) Dust should be included although it causes low impact.
(2) The presence and/or absence of lead and zinc depends upon the correct use of unleaded
fuel and the maintenance of engines.
The main pollutants produced by running vehicles are: solid particles ( corrosion, metal,tyres
, road surface etc.), lead, cadmium, and organic compounds (grease, lubricating oils, rubber,
etc.). The effect are significant in streams at the point of emission (runoff discharge point).
Accidental spillage could represent the most dangerous pollutant for water courses. The
presence of the rivers Drini and Gjadri places an important role in the protection of water
quality and associated vegetal biota. The road alignment avoids the crossing of the Drini river
9



at km 22. This causes the avoiding of substantial alteration in the local hydrological system
supporting biological communities.
(3) The generation of this kind of pollution significally depends upon the pouring of polluted
waters from the road surface, upon the agriculture land in turn reaching groundwater through
percolation.
(4) Road construction interferes with the pattern of existing drainage and irrigation system.
(5) There is no need for washing the gravel, because on that area the gravel from Drini river is
cleaned.

The negative effect of habitat disruption/isolation in the wildlife population is related to; (i) interference with
the seasonal migrating behaviour of wild populations due to food availability etc.; and (ii) isolation of wild
populations with the risk of "inbreeding" or consanguineous crossing that can result in loss of competitiveness
and lowering of survival rates for the whole population for a certain species.

6.  Identification of alternatives: comparison of different alternatives in relation to the
overall benefits of selecting the proposed route.
We have been compared the altematives from environmental viewpoint to select the most
appropriate solution respecting also the needs of the proposed development in order that the
benefits from the implementation of developments can be maximised and negative impacts can
be significantly mitigated at an early stage. The choice of the selected alternative is supported
by findings acquired during the field visit and information from the road and by reading project
maps of Lezha-Shkoder Road Section.
For comparison purposes of the different alternatives from environmental viewpoint, only
Section B, which has different Environmental impacts for each alternative, has been
considered. Sections A and C are the same for all options.

The proposed road alignment by-passes some small communities. it is represented by the
locating the road in areas with lowest density of housing, between Balldremi and Bushati
area.
This solution avoids to destroy and/or resettle any dwellings. The requiring the road to pass
nearby a limited number of rural houses s is the outcome of this choise, which is unavoidable
due to the layout of the said houses. Some other rural houses are located in vicinity of the
road.
As we mentioned, the proposed road alignment passes in a flat plain on clay sand and sandy
clay formations, ensuring in this way a good stability of the slopes. This is one of the benefits
of this alternative. The most significant landscape elements are crossing the rivers of Drini and
Gjadri (at km 6, 7, 14, 25 etc), the valleys have a well developed bank growth of trees.
No major conflict zones with human settlements in section (B) and nature interest appears .
The soil erosion is not a significant impact since the road is in embankment (except 500 ml in
cutting). The noise level which is in function of traffic, distance from the road, topography,
the present of obstructions, is lower than in the other alternatives as road passes through
unpolluted area. From Traffic safety point of view it also avoids the happening of accidents
during the construction phase. The impact on flora and fauna is mitigated by construction of
some bridges and underpasses.
The proposed alternative will generally not have adverse air and noise effects on communities
due to a combination of routing and proposed mitigation measures. All alternatives present a
risk of accidental spillage affecting on water pollution. In all cases mitigation measures (road
run-off connected into side pipes which end up periodically in some oil seperator facilities)
may reduce, but cannot eliminate completely the risk of contamination.
From the landscape components and sensitive nature areas including natural biocorridors,
there is no areas of preservation status effected by each of the alternative. ( See the map in
Aneks II ).
These impacts, for each alternative can not be completely avoided. However, they are not
considered significant.
Option I and 2 (Their road area have similar features with each other)
In the first alternative, being considered that the soil formations on the other side of the road
widening is made of turfed material and the road passes on some hillness areas (km 5 to 20),
serious problems on the stability of the slopes could be appeared and the cost of the
mitigation measurements to reduce (or eliminate) this big negative effect will be increased too.
The road erosion impact is bigger due to the road cut and embankment. On the second
alternative, the impact of unstable slope is not appears and this alternative is better than the
first one on this point. But anyway, the erosion is higher compared with the proposed
alternative due to the many cutting works.
A big negative impact is that the road (on both alternatives "1" and "2") passes through
populated areas (Bushati, Torovice, Bisht Juge etc.) that could create serious social-
economic issues and also bigger environmental problems during the construction phase. So
that the traffic noise will be of a considerable level since the road alignment crossing some
populated area. In the three options the level of air quality will not be significally different
compared to levels prior to the implementation of the Project.
14



The proposed option (section B), compare with the other ones (which provides the
rehabilitation and widening of the existing roads) have a significant positive results concerning
impact on air quality (vehicle traffic is re-route away from populated area, with increased
vehicle efficiency, smother traffic flow and low pollution production).
It provides a shorter length of the road than the other solutions, improving in this way the
time of travelling. The new road improving enormnously traffic flow conditions with the
possibility to maintain constant travel speed, will cause an increasing engine performance. The
average travel speed on the new road will be increased to 80 km/h for motorcars and 65-70
km/h for trucks. Revolutions per Minute (RPM) of the engines would then be very close to the
optimal 65% ratio; consequently, the "running engine time" would be reduced of at least 80%
as the time to travel along the road would be reduced as so and unburned gas emissions will
also be reduced of about one third.
The following table explain the reduction of the time required to travel along the road:.
Time of travel
Cars:           Existing road                    New road
40 km/h = 0,67km/min            80 km/h = 1.3 kini/in
416 km: kmn/min= 62 min       34.5 km: 1.3 km/min= 26 min
Trucks:    30 km/h: 60 min= 0.5 km/min     60 kni/h: 60 min - 1 km/min
41,6 km: 0.5 = 83 min       34.5 km:  km/nmin= 34.5tmin    I
Conclusion:        No significant environmental impacts or damages are provided to the
new construction and rehabilitation of Lezha-Bacallek (Shkoder) Road
Section.
The impact identified could mitigate with an acceptable cost.

7.   Mitigation plan: identification of effective measures to reduce potentially adverse
environmental impacts including costing, institutional training and monitoring
requirements for these measures.
Mitigation measures reduce the impacts generated by the construction and of the road. In this
case a set of rnitigation measures is proposed in relation to each kind of impact as identified
above.
7.1. Mitigation measures against impacts on soil.
Soil erosion can be mitigated by planting native vegetation (shrubs and grass) on embankment
slopes using top soil taken from excavations. This also avoids the spoil of top soil which can
be re-utilised. It is recommended that other erosion controlling techniques like riprap covering
and soil compacting techniques are parallel used in order to compensate for a grazing
pressure in the initial stages.
The slope of the embankments and the use of granular materials provide also good conditions
for re-growth of vegetation.
7.2. Mitigation measures against impacts on water.
Water from the road surface is collected by the drainage systems and the speed of polluted
water can be reduced and infiltration rate increased by turfing the embankment slopes . Water
drainage patterns in reclaimed areas should not be modified in order to avoid the contact
between polluted and irrigation water. For this purpose on both sides of the embankment the
drainage canals will be maintained and/or completed at lower elevation than the adjacent
irrigation canals (Zadrima field).
Concerning the Drini and qadri rivers, provisions will be made to protect the rivers waters
from being the direct recipient of polluted runoff, collecting the pavement waters into side
pipes. The road avoids crossing the rivers, reducing in this way this impact.. The main bridges
have closed drainage systems that end up in infiltration ditches on both sides of the road or are
connected to the side pipes. Due to the immediate vicinity of the river waters with the road
embankment (at km 2, 10, 31) there is concern for pollution from accidental spillage due to
road accidents. For this reason is necessary that the road has side pipes which end up
periodically in some oil separator facilities. Planting of native trees, shrub and herbaceous
crops would represent a further valid measure to benefit the biotic potential and better
harmonise the road with the surrounding landscape.
16



7.3. Mitigation measures against impacts on air quality.
Mitigation measures for air pollution control can be achieved cheaply by implementing
vegetation screens to filter air pollution, with positive effects also for noise pollution. To
prevent the generation of part of air pollution is envisaged the use of unleaded gasoline and
proper engine maintenance, which also improves vehicle efficiency. Ministry of Transport is
preparing a plan in which is given priority the using of unleaded petrol.
During the works it is important to try to avoid the generation of dust due to quarries and
asphalt plants activity. However, in the case of the present road, since the majority of
construction materials come from existing quarries located outside the project area (more than
2 to 8 km far away) the possible impacts are very limited and can be avoided with the use of
bag houses, mechanical cyclones, etc., as prescribed in the requirements for new concrete and
asphalt plants. Also, the asphalt plants will use the updated technology, and so the impacts on
air are very limited.
The road in its greater part is far from most of inhabited areas. The most critical point is the
sector of the road passing nearby some populated area where the vicinity with some houses is
less than 200m. Nevertheless the area is also rather windy, this means that the atmosphere can
be easily self-cleaned attaching limited importance to this item.
The CEP, is dealing with the preparation of some plans for better protection of the air quality
in National and Local level.
7.4. Mitigation measures against impacts on flora and fauna.
From the project design, underpasses connecting both sides of the road are scheduled on
average 1 every (3.5km ) in correspondence of bridges. At the same time the projects foresees
2-3 drainage pipelines of 0 1-2 m every 0.4 km. Although the communication ways (bridges
and drainage pipelines) normally coincide with small tributaries and hence are located in the
preferential migrating routes, this situation might be ameliorated by constructing further
underpasses that in our case is rather difficult to implement them due to the scarce elevation
of the road from the ground. Considering that drainage channels are 1.5 - 2 m deep and due to
the not very high presence of natural fauna, there is no need for other underpasses. Also the
presence of drainage and irrigation system located on both side of the road , which is another
mitigation measure in place, is to avoid the trespassing of the road by the animals especially in
critical spots Balldrem (km 5), Bushat (km 26) and Berdica (km 33) where the traffic is
heavy.
7.5. Mitigation measures against noise pollution.
Generally noise will be mitigated by the same vegetation screens adopted for air pollution.
There are some settlements located near the road,for which it is foreseen to adopt wood and
vegetal barriers against noise.
17



Since the road, on section B is not located near some communities, impact mitigation
measures will concern mainly the access of trucks to the work yards. The trucks traffic will
increase during the construction works and the worst inconveniences are likely to occur during
construction the underpasses serving the road crossing ( of the most critical sections like
Gocaj , at km 10, Dajci at km 24, Plezha at km 25 etc), obliging to lower speed and
consequent traffic slow down.
18



7.6. Mitigation measures against impacts on land expropriation.
Albania has a low experience on expropriation of private land and related enforcement of
compensation measures. Law No. 7848, currently in force, should ensure that impacts derived
from expropriations are mitigated and properly handled . See Anex III.
Consultation with people avoids the possible conflicts. Within GRD will be established a
unit dealing with expropriation issues and secure getting the property compensation by
owners before the road construction works start.
7.7. Mitigation measures against impacts on the cultural heritage and the landscape.
The cultural heritage is the product of human activity carried out through centuries and it may
be the case that ruins and settlements of archaeological importance are present in the study
area.
The present project does not affect the local heritage, there for mitigation measures are not
required.
At km 22 to 24, where the construction of two deep cut is provided, the road alignment
conflict with nature interest. It has a negative effect from landscape viewpoint. A mitigation
measure for this impact is to construct a bridge on the intersection area of the road with Drini
river, avoiding in this way the construction of one deep cut.
From the landscape point of view mitigation measures for embankments will be provided,
through the planting of native trees, shrubs and herbaceous plants. The provision of extensive
tree plantations in suitable areas is also important.
7.8. Mitigation measures against impacts on road safety.
The road generally avoids crossing intensely inhabited areas and the road safety refers mainly
to the road users themselves. In this case appropriate road traffic signs, marking and road
intersections layout, road barriers are the most appropriate measures to be enforced. Setting
up of speed limits and related patrolling from the Police service is another effective tool.
Also on section A and C, some improvements on the slopes for traffic safety are provided.
An important point the authority is called to define for the safety of road users is to discourage
the crossing of the road by farmers with tractors and, above all, by animal-drawn carts
domestic animals and pedestrians in the lowest sections.
19



8.   Environmental Management and Training: assessment of environmental potentiality
Training is an important component of EIA, being a valuable updating tool particularly in the
Albanian context. Through effective training it is possible to develop ad hoc expertise necessary to
prevent and/or mitigate adverse environmental consequences from roads, which can then be refined
during the course of practical application of EIA to roads.
Although it is foreseen that CEP be the central authority dealing with EIA matters in Albania, it is
recommended that a small Unit to be established within GRD, to adress environmental issues on
related for all road project (design, construction and maintenance). This replies on the one hand to
the need to develop dedicated expertise, and on the other to have ongoing liaisoning between those
responsible for road development and those responsible for environmental issues applied to road
schemes.
A list of potential subjects to be dealt with in the training courses for EIA and road schemes is
presented below:
- Available resources and the environment with elements for sustainable development
- The EIA process: general information and specific focus on roads
- Environmental management and conservation of natural areas with focus on the main biotopes
present in Albania
- Principles of environmental economics
- Principles of biology
- Principles of geology
- Environmental pollution and environmental chemistry
The following is a list of elective courses:
- Latest impact assessment methods
- Cumulative impact analysis
- EIA at strategic level: policies, programmes and plans
- Environmental Health Impact Assessment
- Social Impact Assessment
- Principles of environmental monitoring
- Noise diffusion and barriers
- Vibrations
- Recent techniques to produce asphalt
- Leaded and unleaded gasoline
- Road safety
- Traffic management



9.   Environmental monitoring plan: specification on the type of monitoring, responsible
agency.
The monitoring plan are an effective tool for assessing the accuracy of predicted environmental
impacts made in EIA for the proposed project.
During the impact assessment stage events can be predicted with the aid of various technologies.
After implementation of a road the degree of reliability of assessment of the impacts will be
evaluated, by monitoring parameters utilised to assess each impact. Furthermore, monitoring allows
to understand if impact assessment was reliable, if unforeseen events have occurred, regulations and
laws have been complied with, and to anticipate trends of certain environmental parameters.
The GRD could be responsible for monitoring environmental parameters for the road projects, in the
future, including also this Project. The staff in GRD could control negative impacts of road
construction, maintanance and operation. At present, GRD should be involved in the monitoring and
inspecting road projects for environmental impacts and for implementation of mitigating measures It
may be necessary to develop pragmatically defined standards and create a special monitoring unit
within GRD. Also it is advisable that a third party should be in charge for monitoring of some
environmental impacts in co-operation with GRD. This party can be identified in CEP as operational
body, under the supervision of MoH responsible for co-ordination of monitoring of some activities
in the future.
Monitoring of impacts and of the timely and correct implementation of needed mitigating measures
will be carried out according to a site-specific plan by CEP having mandate, personnel and necessary
capacities. In our Project, the most critical elements to be monitored are implementation of erosion
control measures, management and reclamation of borrow pits, and materials handling and storage
areas, traffic control measures.
A follow -up procedure need to set up by the General Road Directorate in co-operation with CEP
(environmental authority). It may consist of:
(a) Periodic monitoring for continuing review of efficiency of mitigation measures.
(b) observation to study those environmental impacts for which is agreed that further information is
needed.
(C) continuos monitoring to detect unexpected harmful effects.

The considerations presented above indicate that no significant environmental impacts will be
generated by the construction of the Lezha -Shkoder Road Section and also indicate that great
benefits will be derived concerning work opportunities and improvement of the social conditions of
the resident population and developing of infrastructure at local and national level.
Positive evaluations can be the attained on condition that road works and subseauent maintenance
are carried out according to the updated parameters and suggestions provided.

Tenms of Reference to Prepare Environmental Impact Assessment for the Proposed
Lezha-Shkoder and Vora-Durres New Road Alignments
Background:
The improvement of the Roads network is an important component of the Government of
Albania's Investment Plan. It is also the basis for the proposed "Road Network
Development Strategy of Development in the Republic of Albania, August 1995. In
addition to the rehabilitation components in the East-West Corridor and the North-South
Corridor, the Government is interested in the inclusion of the new alignments connecting
Lezha to Shkoder and Vore to Durres.
As the project involves the construction of new road, the World Bank requires that the
borrower prepare an environmental impact assessment (EIA) for the project. The purpose
of the EIA is improve decision making and ensure that project options are
environmentally sound and sustainable. EIlAs identify ways to improve projects
environmentally and socially by preventing, minimizing or mitigating adverse impacts.
Consultant Tasks:
The consultants selected by GRD to prepare the environmental impacts
assessment for the two new sections will be responsible for the following tasks:
1.    Screening: Undertake a screening exercise of the potential site to identifying the
potential magnitude of the impacts and hence the depth of the study required. This task
has already been done for both Lezha-Shkoder and Vora-Durres. Preliminary findings
suggest that the environmental impacts in the Lezha-Shkoder section will be restricted to
loss of agricultural land and expropriation issues. However, the potential impacts in the
Vora Durres sections which passes through populated areas could potentially involve
resettlement, warranting a social assessment in addition to an environmental impact
assessment.
2.    Scoping: Define the spatial limits of the study - the area to be subjected to
environmental study should be clearly defined. Estimate the time it would take to
undertake the study and establish the study methods and parameters - type of
consultants needed, the agencies which would need to be involved, methods of
consultaion with the local stakeholders, etc. The EIA for the Vora Durres section will
be more detailed than at Lezha-Shkoder as it will involve more impacts due to the
proximity to population centers.
3.    Legal and Institutional: Describe the legal and institutionalframework for
addressing environmental issues in Albania. This could be prepared with the assistance
of the Committee for Environmental Preservation and Protection in the Ministry of
Health. The section should also describe the new legislation on expropriation of land and
how it will be used in the case of Lezha-Skhoder and Vora-Durres roads. The section
should also describe the procedural process of public hearings at the local council,
I



compensation provided as indicated by Mr.Vehip Guri.
4.    Project Description: Describe the proposed road works to be carried out including
the off-site works such as development of quarries, burrow pits, construction camps and
access roads.
5.    Baseline Data: Describe the existing conditions of the project area including the
description of the relevant physical, biological, and socio-economic conditions including
changes which could be anticipated before the commencement of the project. Describe
also expected trends if the proposed road section was not built - further traffic congestion,
pollution of populated areas, loss to the economy due to improper road connections, etc.
6.    Environmental Impact Forecast: Identify and assess both the positive and the
negative impacts of the proposed road sections. In this section the extent of quality of
available data, key data gaps and uncertainties associated with predictions should be
identified or estimated. Topics which do not need further attention should be specified
with supporting rationale. For example in the case of the realignment in Lezha-Skhoder,
the issues of resettlement might not be a factor as the road passes mostly through
agricultural land.
7.    Describe the alternatives proposed and the alignment selected in the new road
sections. Systematic comparison of each of the alternatives and in terms of their
potential environmental considerations. This section should describe the different
alternatives considered and discuss the advantages of the alignment selected since it
avoids residential areas and resettlement issues. The section should detail the
environmental benefits and costs of the proposed recommendations. For example in
Lezha-Shkoder, bypassing populated areas of Lezha will help in lowering of health risks
due to air and water pollution, improvement in road safety and reduction of noise
pollution.
8.    Systematically present the expected impacts and the proposed mitigation measures
and prepare a environmental mitigation and monitoring plan. The possible impacts
anticipated and mitigation measures include the following:
SOIL
Impacts: The proposed project crosses agricultural land in some areas and impacts could
include soil erosion, unstable slopes due to road cuttings or embankments, side-tipping of
spoil material which could encroach on adjoining agricultural land and soil contamination
due to road runoffs (ex; for approx 10,000 vehicles/day up to 128.6 ppm of lead could be
discharged within 10m from the road from traffic, whereas the tolerance limit for plants
is less than 0.1 ppm.)
Mitigation: Planting trees in the cleared areas and slopes is the most efficient way of
stabilizing soil and preventing soil erosion. Store and reuse top soil which is an important
resource to used later on the slopes to grow grass and trees. Proper compaction of soil
and inexpensive methods such as use of riprap and grass to stabilize slopes. Proper design
2



of drains and settlement basins to catch polluted water before it reaches critical areas such
as water bodies and agricultural land.
WATER
Impacts. Pollutant loads in road runoffs for approx 10,000 vehicles per day correspond to
80 to 120 gms/km/day of lead, 40 gms/km/day of zinc and dust of 150 kg/km/day). If the
road runoff water is not properly drained they could contaminate the adjoining
agricultural lands and other open water bodies. The chances of groundwater pollution is
also relatively high. Site visits have shown that in most cases the irrigation channels are
very close to the road which could result in soil and plants contamination. Furthermore
road construction are likely to change existing water drainage patterns - causing flooding,
or water stagnation.
Mitigation: Design of closed drainage systems for the bridges to prevent runoff polluting
rivers. The runoff should be preferably collected in infiltration ditches (economical and
highly effective) on either side of the bridges to reduce flow of pollutants into water
bodies and adjoining agricultural land. Other measures include water speed reduction
structures such as grasses, bushes, riprap. Cross drainage design in the case of change in
original water drainage patterns should take into account hydrological data and water flow
patterns for the proposed project area.
AIR QUALITY
Impacts: The road route avoids populated areas in the case of Lezha-Shkoder but runs
through populated areas from Vora to Durres and hence the impacts could be limited in
one case and severe in the other. Use of leaded gasoline and the resulting emissions
through aersols are very harmful to health and are known cause of neurological disorders
among children. Other harmful pollutants emitted include carbon monoxide due to
incomplete combustion, sulfur dioxide from high sulfur diesel fuels.
Mitigation: Measures should target both site specific and policy issues at the national level
to control air pollution in the highway sector. Site specific measures include using
vegetation screens to filter TSPs and dust from the road traffic. The provision of an
underpass close tQthe school as per the design drawings is a good mitigation measure.
Policy measures include use of low sulfur fuels, reduce lead content in fuels, vehicle
emission control and traffic management. Furthermore, during construction, the location
of quarries and asphalt plants should be away from residential areas. Inclusion of dust
reduction measures in asphalt plants and quarries such as bag houses, m&-hAnical
cyclones, etc.
FLORA AND FAUNA
Impacts:     The roads generally pass through agricultural land and the impacts on the
flora and fauna will not be as severe as passing through virgin forests. Nevertheless, the
lack of knowledge of the existing flora and fauna in the area may contribute to possible
negative impacts on some rare species. Furthermore the construction activity and storage
of materials and the construction of access roads could be affect the flora and fauna in the
3



adjoining areas. For example: when the road cuts through some natural habitat in the
Lezha-S*hoder realignment, it could impact flora and fauna destroying their habitat and
isolate wildlife on either side of the highway. In Albania the creation of a new highway
could also entice new dwellings or even whole villages to move closer to the road,
placing further pressure on natural habitats.
Mitigation:  A rapid assessment of the flora and fauna in the area should be carried out
to evaluate the measures necessary to prevent any permanent damage to the area. (This
item could be less important in Vora-Durres section) Mitigation measures include
planting of screens and bushes to provide protection from pollutants in adjacent areas to
road construction. Providing safe animal crossings (provision of underpasses connecting
both sides of the roads, fencing in sensitive areas to prevent animals crossing the
highways). Furthermore laws to prevent induced development (roadside development of
business, commercial and residential buildings)or the establishment of a clearance zone
close to highways.
NOISE POLLUTION
Impacts:     The noise normally generated from a fairly busy highway during the day (
more than 7500/vehicles/day) is in the order of 60 to 90 decibels db(A). Noise pollution
over 55 db(A) is disruptive. Noise pollution could be a potential problem in the Vora-
Durres section in the future as population centers are very close to the proposed road.
The quarries and crushers during the construction phase could also be a source of noise
pollution if located close to residential areas.
Mitigation:  Mitigation measures could be taken in pavement design and maintenance of
the road such as using graded asphalt and avoidance of surface dressing close to sensitive
areas. Other measures include the construction of embankments/barriers and mounds to
suppress the noise pollution close to houses and schools. The barriers could be
constructed in mud, wood or solid concrete. Elevation/depression of the road close to
population areas is another method to restrict noise pollution. Probably the most cost
effective mitigation measures will be a combination of mud barriers and restricted
dampers such as shrubs and trees. The barriers are generally need to be between 2 to 4
meters high.
LAND ACQUISITION AND RESETTLEMENT
Impacts:    There will be no instances of destruction of dwellings, business or any
major resettlement involved in the Lezha-Shkoder section. The roads mostly pass through
agricultural lands which do not seem to be under active cultivation. Furthermore the
Albanian Government is in the process of drafting legislation on expropriation of land and
fair compensation. The Vora-Durres section is liable to potential resettlement issues and
hence a Social Assessment has to be undertaken and Resettlement Plan prepared.
Though the land will be expropriated for public projects with compensation, nevertheless
these actions cause social disruption and economic loss for the affected families and
communities. In addition to economic impacts there maybe social and psychological costs
associated with the expropriation of property. ( However, during discussions with farmers
close to Milot, they seem to be aware of the project and supportive of road project which
4



they feel will contribute to their well being and provide them with better business
opportunities to sell their produce.
Mitigation: Describe the current setting - the government establishing private
ownership of land, etc. Describe the recent expropriation law being developed in Albania
including the proposed compensation measures being considered. Furthermore, describe
the consultation process as described by Mr. Vehig Guri - discussions with local councils
on the proposed routes, etc. Mitigation measure normally consist of consultation with
affected people before the alternatives are selected, decisions regarding financial
compensation, decisions on rehabilitation or reestablishing their livelihood.
CULTURAL HERITAGE
Impacts: Damages to historical and cultural sites are possible during road construction
and related works such as development of quarries and bWrrow pits. Road construction
could also damage the atheistic of cultural and archeological monuments.
Mitigation: Carry out investigation of inventories of cultural and historical sites along
with bibliographic searches to check for possible impacts of the proposed route on
cultural and historical monuments. This check should be done in close collaboration with
the Ministry of Culture. If the road does pass close to cultural and historical monuments
then the contracting agencies should be made aware of safety precautions to be taken
with regards to proper disclosure and protection of sites and artifacts. Cooperation with
the Ministry of Culture and Committee for Environmental Preservation and Protection
will be needed.
ROAD SAFETY
Impacts:     Traffic has risen more than ten fold in Albania over the last five years and
with it the potential for traffic accidents which will become a major public health problem
for the country. New roads will help in reducing accidents, but increase in speeds results
in more fatalities. Estimate the existing number of traffic accidents per 100,000 vehicles
with the help of hospital and police records.. In addition to road user safety, construction
workers at site are also at the risk of accidents.
Mitigation:   Analysis of traffic accidents is essential for the development of mitigation
measures. Information on the number of death , injuries, location of the accidents are
used to identify road black spots where physical road safety improvements will have
maximum impact in reducing the number of actidents. Mitigation measures locally
include traffic signs, markings, proper intersection layout, presence of road barriers such
as trees, poles, walls. Policy issues such as speed limits, and vehicle inspections
contribute to reduction in traffic accidents. (Discuss the proposed grant from EU for road
safety). In addition measures to promote worker safety in the road construction needs to
be addressed. Safety measures including wearing of helmets, signs to reduce speed in
worker areas, etc.
4.    Describe the training needs necessary to establish capacity within the Ministry of
Construction and Tourism to implement the mitigation and monitor the mitigation
5



measures identified through the Environmental Impact Assessment. For example: the
TA financed under the project will assist in developing an action plan to build sufficient
capabilities within GRD. A small unit could be established within GRD to address
environmental issues for all road projects. The unit should be trained in environmental
management, preparation of EIAs, monitoring of environmental mitigation measures, etc.
5.    Identify the agency which should monitor the proposed mitigation measures
which also should include detailing of responsibilities. In the initial phases when capacity
is being built within the General Roads Directorate, involving the Directorate of
Environment within the Ministry of Health could be prove beneficial.
6.    Cost the mitigation measures proposed including the costs which could be
incurred for supervision,monitoning and training. There has already been some costing
done in the study already submitted. For example the costing for planting of screens,
fencing in sensitive areas, closed drainage for bridges, sound barriers, etc. The costs of
financial compensation for expropriation of land. These costs should be internalized as
part of the overall project costs.
7.    Summarize the mitigation measures through a Environmental Mitigation and
Monitoring Plan as shown below:

8.    List the Environmental Assessment preparers and the organization which helped
in the study. Include references of materials used in the report preparaton. Record also
interagency/forum/consultation meetings which should include meetings with the local
stakeholders/affected population.
