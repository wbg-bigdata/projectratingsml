SEV'.4TH AGRICULTURAL CREDIT PROJECT
(Loan 1891-ME)
PREFACE
1.       This is  the  Project  Completion  Report  (PCR)  for  the Seventh
Agricultural Credit Project (Loan 1891-ME), executed by the FIRA trust
funds in Mexico. The loan was approved by the Board on August 7, 1980 for
an amount of US$325 million, which was fully disbursed.
2.       The PCR was prepared  by  the  Latin America and Caribbean Region,
Ag -icultural Division C; a country visit by project staff taking place in
Aptil 1935. It is based on a special report and data prepared by the
Borrower, the Staff Appraisal Report (2944-ME), the President's Report (P-
2836-ME), and the Loan Guarantee, and Project Ag-ecments dated August 15,
1980.    Supervision  reports,  zorrespondence  be.ween  the  Bank  and the
Borrower, and internal Bank memoranda on project issues as ccntained in
relevant Bank files were also reviewed.
3.       This PCR was read  by  the Operations Evaluation Department (OED).
The draft PCR was sent to the Borrower for comments and they are attached
to the Report (Attachment I).

PROJECT COMPLETION REPORT
MEXICO
SEVENTH AGRICULTURAi. CREDIT P-'-ECT
(Loan 1891-ME)
EVALUATION SLHARY
Obiectives
1.       The loan, for USS325 M, was the seventh to finance Mexican
agricultural credit. It permitted a government trust fund, FIRA, to e:;pand
its rediscounting of agricultural and agro-industrial loars made by
commercial banks and by a special state bank (BANRURAL) for loans to small-
scale and non-creditworthy farmers. The objectives of the Project were:
(a) to expand and increase the efficiency of agricultural ari agro-
industrial production by expanding inv3stment therein;
(b) to sttengthen FIRA's planning, training, and M&E;
(c)  to robilize more pa'sticipation from private banks; and
(d) by introducing flexible interest rates pegged to the Average Cost
of Funds, to arrest FIRA's decapitalization.
The means to attain these obiectives were:
(a) Use of US$319 M of proceeds from the Bank loan to permit expansion
.f FIRA's three-year agricultural and agro-industrial loan
rediscount program to US$5,700 M (of which US$1,159.4 M in the
project); and
(b)  Use of US$6 M of Bank loan proceeds to support FIkA's three-year
US$19.6 M program to stret.gthen its training, demonstration,
planning i rrogramming, and monitoring & evaluation.
Major weaknesses of earlier agricultural credit projects had been:
(a)  concentration on banking aspects of agriculbural credit--lending
and recovery of funds--with insufficient attention to development
aspects--the ultimate financial and economic impact of investments
made with the loans; and
(b) decapitalization of FIRA in Mexico's increasingly inflationary
environment because its interest rates were not keeping pace with
inflation.  (Reco"ery experience, however, was very good.)
2.       The first problem was addressed in this project by the planned
strengthening of M&E, by training officers of FIRA and of banks whose loans
were being rediscounted, by creating an operations and regulations manual,



- v -
and by decentralizing decision-making. The second problem was addressed by
agreeing to adjust interest rates to the Average Cost of Funds (ACF), a
step which ..e Borrower had bean unwilling to take in the previous project.
Implementation Experience
3,       Implementation, between 1981 and 1984, coincided vith one of the
most difficult periods in Mexico's recent econoolc history. Inflation
accelerated to 992 in 1982 and 812 in 1983. The shift from fixed-rate
See Borrow-  lending to variable rates was achieved, but adjustments were not sufficient
er's         to bring FIRA's lending ratos up to the rate of inflation.  The ACF itself
commer.t #1   remained below the consumers' price index, modestly in 1981, then by ca.
402/year in 1982-3. Furthermore, there were delays in adjusting FIRA's
lending rates to the ACF. Moreover, the FIRA VII loan agreement called for
negative interest rates to low-income and middle-income borrowers, and
these categories were expanded.
4.       On three occasions, totalling fifteen months, the borrower failed
See Borrow- to make the required interest-rate adjustments on time and, consequently,
er's         agreed not to submit disbursement requests.
comment #2
5.       The project was affected by inclusion in Mexizo's Special Action
Program (SAP) in DeceLber 1983. As a result, the final (January 1984)
interest rate adjustment was less than had been called for in the loan
agreement, Bank loans were used to rediscount US$30 M of short-term working
capital loans, and the Bank increased its disbursement percentag_ from 40X
to 70Z. As a result, loan disbursements, which had fallen quite far behind
See Borrow- schedule as a result of the voluntary suspensions, accelerated.  Forty
er's         percent of the loan amount was disbursed between January and September 1984
commenc #3  and the loan was fully disbursed by end September 1984, six months behind
projections.
6.       While Bank supervision very much concentrated on interest rates,
monitoring and evaluation was a secondary theme. Despite urgings from the
Bank, FIRA kept poatponing the necessary moadifications and revisions of the
sample of 370 forms receiving loans. Consequently, the sample was no
longer a reliable indicator of the financial or economic impact of the
loans .l/
Results
7.       Uncertainty remains regarding the economic ano financial impact of
See Borrow- the project due to the weaknesses of the monitoring system.  However, the
er's         results of that sample and field observations by Bank missions suggest that
comment #5  investments stemming from the project had acceptable or high rates of
return. During the project period, farmers were the victims of declining
producer prices in real terms as administered prices failed to keep pace
with inflation. Investmente that were finAncially attractive with highly
subsidized credit, therefore, might not have been without it. There is no
1, Nevertheless, the Borrower points out, the Bank itself has found that
the project had considerable achievements in output and economic rate of
return. See comment #4.



- vi -
reason to believe that economic returns were affected by the growing
distortions in the economy.
8.       During the project period, 65S of the loans FIRA rediscounted were
for short-term credit, 352 for investment. FIRA reports that 462 of
project loans went to low-income producers (LIP) and 35M to medium-incoe
producers (MIP). These figures cannot be taken at face value becauset a)
by agreement, during the project, the definition of MIP was changed to
expand it; and b) supervision missions have frequently found that loans
submitted in the LIP category were to beneficiaries with too much income to
qualify for that category.2/
9.       Except for M&E, institution building was successful.  FIRA
improved its organization and management structure, decentralized decision-
making, and introduced an operations and regulations manual. Its
extension, training, and demonstration activities for bank technieians and
farmers increased. However, M&E deteriorated considerably, and
insufficient attention was given to impact analysis.
10.      While FIRA became organizationally stronger, it became financially
weaker, decapitalized by extremely negative interest rates. Although the
rural credit system made a major shift from fixed interest rater to
variable ones, covenants in the loan agreement were weakened by delays in
applying them and then abandoned with agreement on the SAP. Furthermore,
safeguards in a side letter for cases where ACF lagged substantially behind
the CPI, as happened during the project, proved worthless.
Sustainability
11.      FIRA could not sustain the kind of decapitalization that occurred
during the project. This was recognized during implementation and
addressed through the General Interest Rate Agreement (GIRA), which applied
to the project's successors. The participating commercial banks, however,
were not decapitalized. Indeed, they were shielded from potential
decapitalization by FIRA, thereby sustaining their strong agricultural
capacity.
12.      FIRA trained over 56,000 bank technicians (its own and those of
participating banks) and farmers during the project, an effort that should
produce a sustainable improvement in their capacity to assess farm loans,
give farmers advice, or to farm. FIRA and t1, participating banks are
institutionally stronger in other ways as well as a result of the project.
However, FIRA failed to exert a positive influence on BANRURAL as expected.3/
13.      Due to FIRA's deteriorated N1&E system, 4udgements about farm
impact are risky. However, it is likely that most of the farm investments
financed will prove sustainable if Me;,.ico provides an economic environment
conducive to agricultural growth.
2/ The Borrower takes strong exception to this assertion (h). See comUent
#6.
3/ While IBRD may have expected such influence, the Borrower points out the
independence of FIRA and BANRURAL. See comment 7.

Findinas
14.      The project illustrates the difficulty of Implementing an
agricultural credit project in conditions of rapid inflation. Despite
drawbacks, the project helped FIRA and the participating banks maintain or
expand agricultural lending during this period, while maintaining the
financial strength and increasing the institutional strength of the
participating banks whose loans were being rediscounted.
15,      FIRA's inadequate system for measuring project impact makes it
uncertain, but most agricultural investments supported by the project were
probably economically justified. Agricultural investment was sustained in
a period when agriculture's terms of trade worsened and many agricultural
investments would not have been financially attractive without heavily
subsidized credit.
16.      Against these considerable achievements, there are considerable
drawbacks, the most important of which is the immense public cost of
sustaining agricultural investment without weakening the participating
banks. The system did switch from fixed interest rates to variable ones,
but decapitalization, at great cost to the fisc, was not arrested.
Moreover, to achieve timely disbursements, especially as part of SAP, Bank
financing was switched from investments to recurrent expenditures and more
negative interest rates than agreed at negotiations were accepted.
Moreover, FIRA wai unable to strengthen BANRURAL, and FIRA management's
attention turned more to disbursements and less to M&E and the economic and
financial i )act of its program.



eROJECT COMPLETION REPORT
MEXICO
SEVENTH AGRICULTURAL CREDIT PROJECT
(Loan 1891-ME)
I. INTRODUCTION
1.01       Mexico's agricultural aector, excluding agroindustries, contributes
about 10% af the gross domestic proeuct and employs about ^:ne-third of the
country's active labor force.  During the decade nf the 1970s, agriculture's
rate of growth declined significantly to an average of 3X pet annum, during
which time the terms of trade turned against agriculture. As a result,
agricultural exports declined dramatically and food imports increased
sharply. To reverse this, the Government started in 1980 to increase
sharply farmgate support prices, and inercduced a broad range of input
subsidies. Although successful in increasing food production, the program
proved too costly and was abandoned In 1982. Since 1982, input subsidies
have been sharply reduced and farmgate pric es raised at levels close to
border prices. However, food retail prices have increased considerably less
than inflation, and as a result, consumer 5ibsidies have expanded.
L.02       The National Rural Credit Bank (BANRURAL) and the Agricultural
Trust Funds (FIRA) have together provided over 90% of institutional credit
for agriculture in Mexico. Although only about 30% to 35% of producers
receive institutional credit, outstanding agricultural credit had increased
from 1977 to 1981 by about [0% annuallv in real terms, with about 50%
going to Low-Income Producers (LIPs). However, credit fell by about 28%o in
real terms in 1982, and 25% in 1983. The decline occurred because:
(a) with high inflation (99% in 1982 and 81% in 1983) the recuperations on
the existing loan portfolio were inadequate to cover the demand for funds;
and (b) the Government was unable to finance the large subsidy required to
bridge this gap.  Since 1984, institutional credit has grown again (17% in
real terms), helped by the Bank's Special Action Program (SAP) to Mexico.
1.03       The Bank, in supporting the Government's agricultural develooment
program, financed seven loans to FIRA- between 1965 and mid-1984 amounting to
US$925 million for investment lending. Since mid-1984, the Bank has financed
two further loans, Loan 2454-ME (the Eighth Agricultural Credit Project) for
U3S300 million, which has been fully disbursed, and Loan 2610-ME (the Interim
Agricultural Credit Loan) for US$180 million, signed in September 1985. By
supporting FIRA, the Bank has, 4n addition to providing increased resources
to agriculture: (a) improved the standards for economic, financial and
technical soundness of agricultural subloans; (b) increased the allocation of
funds to LIPs; (c) improved production support services through the upgrading
and the increase in number of technicians, including those of the
participating banks; and (d) contributed to improved sector policies through
the reduction of interest rate subsidies.
II.  PROJECT IDENTIFICATION A.YD PREPARATION
2.01       The Seventh Project was prepared by FIRA as a continuation of Bank
assistance to FIRA's investment lending program. Previous project completion
reports (PCRs) had shown FIRA's performance to be i-mpressive, the projects



- 2 -
having a strong positive impact on agricultural production and institution
building. However, beginning in 1976 FIRA's interest rates had gradually
fallen below commercial rates as subloans were made at fixed interest rates
and interim rate adjustments proved to be insufficient to keep pace with
inflation.
Objectives
2.02      The Seventh Project was to continue FIRA's program to providt
credit based on technically sound investment plans for increased production
of annual and perennial crops, beef, dairy products, agroindustries and
fisheries. The project's specific objectives were to: (a) increase low- and
medium-income farmer participation; (b) strenghthen FIRA's institutional
development through technical staff training, the introduction of an
operating procedures' manual, and monitoring and evaluation; (c) expand
commercial bank participation in agriculture; and (d) introduce the principle
of adjustable interest rates in agricultural financing.
Description and Financing
2.03       The Bank loan of USS325 million was to support a FIRA line of
credit equal to 21% of FIRA's estimated investment lending over a three and
one-half year period (1980-1983). This would cover investments estimated at
US$1,179 million, of which 28% was to be financed by the Bank, 42% by FIRA
from its own resources, 15% by participating banks, and 15% by the
producers. The project cost was based on mid-1980 prices plus 31% for price
contingencies. About US$20 million of the project was designated for
productive support, .raining, monitoring and evaluation, demonstration,
planning and programming, and consultant services.
Appraisal and Negotiations
2.04      As in the previous two FIRA projects (Loans 1217-ME and 1569-ME),
the major issue was interest rates on subloans. It was agreed in
negotiations that: (a) interest rates would be linked to the average cost of
funds to the country's financial institutions'/ (ACF) at the time;
(b) subsidies through interest rates would be progressively reduced and only
LIPs would continue to receive subsidized credit; (c) the agreed rates would
be applied to all agriculture credit; and (d) because of uncertainties on the
future course of inflation, a system for periodic adjustments of interest
rates would be introduced.
2.05      Following the above, interest rates were initially set: (a) to
medium-income producers (MIPs) at 17%, equal to the average ACF for the
previous 12 months; (b) to LIPs at 14% and 15.5%, which was below ACF; and
(c) to the other producers (OTPs) at 18% to _1%, which was above ACF.  In
1/ An index published monthly by the Banco de Mexico.



-3-
addition, the rates were to be adjusted annually to reflect the change in the
average ACF over the preceding 12 months compared to the previously agreed
rates. Furthermore, the Government provided a side letter, undertaking to
review the interest rates whenever the average ACF of a three-month period
differed by three or more points from the chen existing rates. However, if
after rXview and discussion with the Bank there was no agreement, the
existing rates would continue.
2.06       At the Board presentation, the Directors were concerned that the
interest rate levels were negative, a problem that was also noted in the PCR
for the Fourth Credit Project. Also, the Board expressed its concern over
FIRA's capability to introduce an effective monitoring and evaluation system.
III. IMPLEMENTATION
3.01       The loan was signed in August 1980, became effective in November
1980, and was fully disbursed in September 1984, six months after the
original clo3ing date.
Beneficiary Categories and Reallocation of Funds
3.02       The beneficiary categories2/ were revised in January 1982, the
main change being the expansion of the MIP category to include all producers
with an annual family income equal to 3,000 times the minimum daily wage
rate, compared to 2,000 times the wage rate in the previous de5inition.
However, this had the effect of incorporating many producers Into MIPs who
would have been categorized previously as OTPs. To coincide with the ch'anges
in defining beneficiary categories, and in the credit demand caused by Lhe
difficult financial years in Mexico (1982 and 1983), the Bank agreed to two
reallocation of funds between categories under the project (Table 6). Also,
as a part of SAP (para. 1.02), US$30 million was reallocated to short term
credit for LIP working capital. LIPs eventually received 51% of the Bank
loan.
Project Cost and Financing
3.03       Project cost was US$800 million, compared to US$1,179 estimated at
appraisal (Table 1). The reduced size of the project in US dollars was
2/ Subloan Beneficiary Categories:
"Low Income Producer (LIP)"--a farmer whose main source of income is
derived from farming, and whose net annual family income does not
exceed 1,000 times the daily minimum wage for the region where he is
locatea.
"Medium Income Producer (MIP)"--a farmer who does not qualify as LIP, but
whose net annual family income does not exceed 3,000 times (up to June
1982, 2,000 times) the daily minimum wage for the region where he    is
located.
"Other Producer (OTP)"-a farmer whose income is above that of a LIP or a
MIP.

mainly the result of: (a) signific-nt devaluations of the Mexican peso during
the life of the project (M$23 to US$1 at appraisal, compared to the average
project disbursement rate of MS109 to US$1); and (b) increased Bank
participation under SAP, from 28% estimated at appraisal to 41Z, with FIRA's
participation reduced from an estimated 42% to 23%. Participating banks'
contribution under the project remained at 15%, as estimated.
Characteristics of Investments and Subloans
3.04       Table 4 shows crop investments representing about 47% of the
project costs, with livestock at 42% and agroindustries 10%.  Machinery and
equipment purchases continued to dominate crop production costs, at 54%,
while cattle purchases dominated livestock investments, also at 54%.
Agroindustries investments supported mainly packing plants, animal feed, wine
processing, sawmills, and fish farming. The number of subloans,
beneficiaries, and amount discounted by FIRA for investment lending are
summarized in Table 5. Of the 393,765 families (2.2 million persons)
benefiting from the projecr, 238,280 families (1.3 million persons) were
LIPs, excluding agroindustries beneficiaries. At appraisal, it was estimated
that 140,000 families (770,000 persons) would benefit. Despite FIRA'i
efforts to diversify its program nationwide, the more prosperous irrigation
areas in Mexico's Northwest, Northeast, and Central Districts ccatinued to
absorb the bulk of FIRA's lending, with about 48% discounted to these areas
under the project.
Productive Support
3.05       The productive support component of the project was almost fully
utilized (90%), mainly to support the operations of the c'emonstration farms
and to provide training to producers and technicians of boLh FIRA and
participating banks. Junds designated under the project for consultant
services for the development of planning and programming, and monitoring and
evaluation were not utilized because of delays in introducing the programs
planned.
3.06      Under the project, FIRA increased the number of its demonstration
farms from 53 to 98, specializing in a wide range of agricultural activities
including basic crops, milk, forage, fruits, beef. small animals, irrigation
and agroindustry. After the doubling of expenses for training and
demonstration centers in 1981, FIRA reduced these expenses in 1982-1983 as
part of the Government's austerity program. Ouring the period 1980-1984,
FIRA increased its training program, with 525 courses in 1980 to 852 in
1984. FIRA's courses from 1980 to 1984 had over 56,000 participants,
including technicians from its own staff, participating banks' technicians,
and producers who were mainly LIPs.
Disbursements
3.07       After three years (Lo December 1983), Bank disbursements were only
60% of appraisal estimate, with three stoprages of disbursements totalling



-5-
about 15 months (Table 8). These stoppages occurred when subloan commitments
were not eligi.le for Bank disbursements due to the lack of timely agreements
between the Government and the Bank on the level to which interest rates
should have been annually adjusted. The remaining 40% of the Bank loan was
disbursed in nine months, between January and September 1984, strongly aided
by the inclusion of the project in the SAP, under which Bank disbursements
were increased from 40% to 70% of FIRA discounts. Also, the Bank allowed
US$30 million to be disbursed to LIPs for working capital credit, and
extended the formal closing date by a year to December 1984.
Sublending Terms and Conditions
3.08      Contrary to project design, ineerest rates, despite some
adjustments, continued to be negative throughout the implementation period
(Table 9). Also, the linkage of the interest rates to ACF failed to achieve
the desired results as, for a while, ACF lagged substantially below inflation
levels. This was strongly influenced hy the Government's fiscal policies,
which kept the cost of funds (deposit rates) artificially low. What was at
first merely a lag of ACF behind inflation (4% to 6%) later developed into a
wide disparity in 1982-83, when ACF ranged from 46% to 56% compared to
inflation levels of 99% and 81% in those years. The margins between the
rates charged and inflation were significant because the loan agreement
provided for annual interest rate adjustments. The side letter providing for
discussion of interest rates if the average ACF had tncreased over the
previous three monzhs by more than 3 percentage points (para. 3.05), was not
helpful because in the absence of an Agreement, the annually adjusted fixed
rates continued to apply. The Government's position was consistently one of
optimism about its ability to reduce inflation levels speedily.3/
3.09      The final adjustment of interest rates under the project (average
increase of about 5 percentage points) was effected in January 1984 at rates
below those required by the loan documents. However, in agreeing to the new
rates, the Bank took into consideration (a) the new Government's recent
policy of increasing producer prices to about world levels; (b) the reduction
of input subsidies for water and fertilizers; (c) the political constraints
in relation to the size of the adjustments required (17% average increase was
required for compliance), especially as there was an indication that both
inflation and ACF were declining; and most importantly, (d) the agreement by
the Mexicans to a comprehensive review of interest rates, which later formed
the framework for the General Interest Rate Agreement (GIRA). The GIRA,
signed in August 1984, covered the following principal points: (a) interest
rates were defined as a percentage of ACF, and would progressively move
towards real positive rates by January i, 1987, except for rates to LIPs,
which would remain subsidized by about 20%; (b) the ACF or other replacement
index would be allowed to reflect meaningfully the cost of funds; and
(c) variable rates would be introduced. In addition, the Government would
carry out a study of subloan beneficiary categories to redefine them in order
to reduce the level of credit subsidy.
3/ The Borrower points out that the provisiors of the side letter were not
trivcgered precisely because of the way macroeconomic policy affected
interest rates.



-6-
Monitoring and Evaluation
3.10      FIRA's system of monitoring and evaluation was introduced as a
requirement of the Bank during the Fifth Project in 1977. It measured, on a
continuous basis, the progress of about 370 subprojects (originally 500) for
the five-year period to December 1983. However, as FIRA's lending expanded
and many producers changed their principal activities, the sample was no
longer representative. It required expansion and a change in the combination
of subprojects to be monitored. Also, it required a change of emphasis for
it to be utilized as a tool to identify problems at the producer level and to
act as a trigger for remedial action.
3.11      The Bank had provided, as part of the productive support component
of the project, funds to assist in financing t: further development of the
monitoring and evaluation system. However, in spite of the urgings of Bank
supervision missions, these funds were not utilized because FIRA kept
postponing the necessary modifications and expansion of the sample. The
system has since been revised, and a new and representative sample of FIRA's
lending of about 1,000 subprojects was introduced in January 1985.
Compliance with Loan Conditions
3.12      On the whole, FIRA complied with loan conditions, and in those
instances in which non-compliance was identified, FIRA quickly implemented
remedial action.
Accounts and Audit, and Reporting Requirements
3.13      FIRA maintained separate and adequate project accounts within its
overall accounting system, which was audited annually by independent and
qualified firms of accountants. Certified copies of audited financial
statements were sent to the Bank on a timely basis, and have been
consistently free of qualifications. FIRA has an efficient system of timely
reporting. Quarterly, semi-annual and annual reports were routinely sent to
the Bank on time, summarizing project performance, subloan disbursements and
project costs, subloan beneficiaries, training activities, and FIRA's
financial operations.
IV. PROJECT IMPACT
4.01      While the substantive proof is weak, as the sample used to measure
the impact of subprojects financed by FIRA was too small (para. 3.10), it is
considered sufficient to indicate that the Seventh Project had a favorable
impact on production and farm income. It supported LIPs in improving their
farm operations and increased rural employment (Table 10), which were good
achievements considering that the project period (1981-1983) was one of the
most difficult in recent years for Mexican agriculture, with high inflation
levels, resulting devaluations, producer prices declining in real terms, and



-7-
inputs becoming more difficult to finance. During project implementation,
subloans for medium- and long-term credit exceeded the appraisal estimate by
over 80%, and more than half were for LIPs (Table 5). In addition, over
8,000 working capital subloans were made to about 50,000 families.
Productive Support
4.02       Under the project, FIRA continued to develop strong technical
capabilities, using its demonstration centers and participating banks'
technicians for accelerating the introduction and adoption of appropriate
technologies into Mexican agriculture (paras. 3.05 and 3.06). The LIP
program's success has been due largely to the technical assistance provided
directly by the participating banks' technicians. In addition to giving
training on land preparation, varieties, planting densities, fertilizer
applications, plant and weed control, technicians also considered the
maximization of financial returns. Ejidatarios interviewed spoke highly to
the Bank missions of the level and quality of assistance provided.
Production Yields and Output
4.03       Production yields of subprojects included in the sample showed
increases for annual crops during 1977 to 1981 (Table 10). However, some
yields fell in 1983 because of adverse climatic conditions in 1982 and the
reduced use of input caused by increased prices. Also, livestock herds as
well as production of milk and beef increased substantially. During the
sample period, beneficiaries increased the value of their equity in real
terms from 30% to over 100%, with the greatest increase attributed to the
increased values of perennial crops. Apart from milk operations, where the
average net income fell by about 20%, the average net income per enterprise
increased by 50% to over 100% in real terms.
Financial and Economic Returns
4.04      The financial returns of the sample were based on a selection of
rainfed and irrigated annual crops, dual purpose cattle, intensive milk
production, and one perennial crop (Table 12). Results were satisfac:ory
ranging from 19% for dual purpose cattle to 27% for grapes, compared to a
range of 22% for dual purpose cattle to 41% for irrigated annual cropE:
estimated at appraisal. Economic rates of return were calculated based on
border prices for the main traded outputs at 1982 constant prices. The
economic returns for the sample was 15% for milk compared to 29% estimated.
Other activities ranged from 29% for dual purpose cattle to 53% for rainfed
annual crops, compared to a range of 21% for dual purpose cattle to over 100%
for irrigated annual crops estimated at appraisal. The financial returns
suggest that the low domestic prices during the period were partially offset
by the interest rate subsidy, especially for annual crops and milk.

V. INSTITUTIONAL PERFORMANCE
FIRA's Financial Position
5.01       While FIRA is a relatively strong financial institution, its equity
suffered decapitalizatLion during 1982 and 1983. During these two years its
profits, which were based on negative and fixed interest rates on its loan
portfolio, were insufficient to offset the levels of inflation. This
position was reversed in 1984, when increased interest rates under the GIRA
(para. 3.09), supported by new equity contributions, resulted in an increase
in equity of 75% in real terms. At end-December 1984, FIRA's equity was
equal to US$290 million. As interest rates become positive and variable
rates are introduced, FIRA should again be able to maintain its equity in
real terms from income. FIRA's operating costs have consistently remained
low, at 2.8% cf the average loan portfolio in 1984, and 1.7% after including
production income from demonstration centers, and Government compensation for
technical assistance. Table 13 summarizes FIRA's financial position.
FIRA's Lending
5.02       At end-1984, FIRA's loan portfolio stood at USS1.1 billion.  For
1977 through 1981, FIRA's lending increased at an average annual rate of 20%
in real terms; it fell at an average of over 20% in real terms in 1982 and
1983, but increased in 1984. The decrease in 1982 and 1983 was the resul- of
the decline in real terws of FIRA's cash resources arising from
decapitalization, despite the funds provided by the Bank (Table 14). Dur!ng
the project period 1981 to 1981., FIRA's discounts were 65% for short termf.
credit and 35% for investment credit. Also, about 42% of discounts were
allocated to LIPs, the balance about equally to MIPs and OTPs. FIRA's
discounts were mainly to the commercial banks, increasing from 83% in 1981 to
94% in 1984, significantly reducing its assistance to the public banks
(mainly BANRURAL).
FIR4's Technical Services
5.03       The promotion of improved production technologies through extension
and demonstration has long been a part of FIRA's activities. Technical
assistance costs between 1981 and 1984 averaged from 1.9% to 2.5% of average
loan portfoLio, with an increased number of demonstration centers and
training courses (paras. 3.05 and 3.06). Over 5,000 technicians are involved
in subloan evaluation and the delivery of technical assistance, of which
about 25% are from FIRA and 757 from participating banks.  In addition, FIRA
guarantees up to 80% of commercial banks' participation in subloans to LIPs.
Payments under this scheme averaged 0.5% to 0.9% of the amounts guaranteed
between 1981 and 1984. In recent years there has been good coordination
between FIRA and the Ministry of Agriculture and Water Resources (SARH) for
research and ext.nsion services. In 1983, about 100 SARH extension staff
received training in FIRA's demonstration units.



-9-
Participating Banks
5.04      As shown in para. 5.02, FIRA's discounts through the commercial
banks have steadily increased at the expense of the public banks, mainly
BANRURAL, which is institutionally a much weaker organization but still
provides credit to over 70% of all LIPs in Mexico. While the Bank had
envisaged that FIRA would provide a positive influence on BANRURAL, this has
not been achieved, particularly in the delivery of technical assistance. The
creation of FICART to service BANRURAL exclusively as a rediscounting window
has not, contributed to cooperation between FANRURAL and FIRA.
5.05      The on-lending margins allowed the participating banks ranged
between 2% for OTPs and 3.5% for LIPs. As FIRA discounted between 70% and
90% of subloans, the participating banks earned positive interest rates on
their investments.
Organization and Management
5.06      FIRA has made significant strides in streamlining, strengthening
and decentralizing its planning and programming. The role of the field
offices was increased, giving the regional offices greater responsibility in
the formulation, implementation and control of their investment programs. To
facilitate improved control and faster subloan processing, FIRA introduced
revision panels ("Mesas de Apoyo"), located in each region for on-the-spot
reviews of subloan documentation submitted by participating banks for
discount. Subloans discounted, which are processed through the local Bank of
Mexico branch, are summarized and forwarded to its headqur ters for overall
review, processing and control. In addition, on the recommendation of the
Bank, FIRA established an operating regulations and procedures manual which
among other things, standardized the participating banks' lending procedures
under FIRA. Training has been given to personnel at the field level,
especially in the area of credit analysis, using computer programs for
analyzing and aggregating data for the preparation of the annual investment
program.
5.07      FIRA has also improved its organization and management stricture.
On the recommendation of the Bank, FIRA decentralized decision-making,
particularly with respect to budgeting, program planning and execution to
regional and state levels. It also expanded the commercial banks' facilities
for providing technical assistance to their clients. The role of the FIRA
regional technicians was changed, giving less emphasis on their direct
involvement with farmers, and more on their role of assisting technicians
from participating banks in identifying and organizing farmers and farmer
groups. Wbere necessary, FIRA's regional technicians provide training and
technical back-up to participating banks' technicians.
Monitoring and Evaluation
5.08      While FIRA cemmitted itself at the beginning of the project to
giving monitoring and evaluation the importance it needed, this commitment



- 10 -
was not fulfilled.  '. had been agreed that the sample introduced in LI17
(para. 3.10) would be replaced on January 1, 1983, by an updated and eypanded
sample. Due to management changes, th.s was delayed and the new sample was
not introduced until January 1985. Monitoring and evaluation had suffered
from the lack of support from senior management and staff, and it was
perceived for a long time as a burden imposed by the Bank rather than as an
important tool for impact analysis cf credit on Mexican agriculture.
VI.  BANK PERFORMANCE
6.01      Throughout the Seventh Project, the Bank's attention was focussed
on the interest rate issue. Its concern during appraisal and negotiations
about the level of future inflation proved to be entirely justified, and its
insistence on introducing a mechanism for adjusting interest rates was
correct. However, the substantial lag of ACF behind inflation (para. 3.08)
and the reluctance of the Government to adjust interest -ates upward and to
make such adjustments in a timely manner, was an important stumbling block.
While the loan documents included a remedy for failure to adjust interest
rates on an annual basis, there was nothing to impel the Government to make
the needed changes required by the side letter (para. 2.05). On three
occasions Government undertook not to submit disbursement requests because of
failure to make the required interest rate adjustment on time.
6.02      The Bank was also sensitive to Mexico's difficult economic and
financial problems. It increased disbursement percentages by including the
project in SAP, thereby increasing overall Bank participation from 28% to
40%, and it transferred US$30 milliGn of investment funds to short term
credit to meet the increased demand for working capital support.  These
actions boosted disbursements, especially during the last year of the
project, thus limiting disbursement delays to only about nine months.
Unfortunatel,-, the Bank also agreed to a redefinition of subloan categories
(para 3.02) which increased the number of farmers with access to preferential
rates, thereby increasing the level of subsidy.
6.03       FIRA's responsiveness to she Bank's recommendations on institution
building has made it into one of the most efficient agricultural credit
institutions in the region. The program of decentralization, development of
the organization and procedures manual, and strengthening of the subloan
evaluation procedures through the Mesas de Apoyo were prime factors in the
development of the institution. While long-term planning and programming
still require further strengthening, this has been addressed in the
subsequent project. The largest remaining area of institutional weakness is
the need to further improve FIRA's monitoring and evaluation procedures and
to maintain management's commitment to its usefulness.



- 11 -
6.04       Bank supervision missions were adequate and timely, reflecting a
high level of continuity in staff participation.  Bank supervision work was
strong in the area of institution building, and remedial action was always
quickly recommended when weaknesses were identified, even though action by
FIRA was not always as prompt. Bank missions regularly visited the
participating banks, field offices and selected producers, and as a result
were able to obtain first-hand impressions of FIRA's lending and technical
support. The relationship between Bank staff and FIRA management was good.4/
VII. CONCLUSIONS
7.01      In the main, project otiectives set at appraisal were met.  FIRA
increased credit participation of low- and mediun-income farmers; 81% of the
project went to these two groups, compared to 65% estimated at appraisal.
The financial and economic rates of returns, shown by the sample measured
were, on average, in line with appraisal estimates. FILA also strengthened
its institutional development, decentralized operations, improved subloan
evaluation procedures, introduced an organization and procedures manual to
guide its own staff and that of the par:icipa'ing banks, expanded its
technical a.ssistance through additional demonstration centers, and
intensified and increased its training programs. The main drawbacks have
been (a) the failure to introduce an interest rate structure reflecting
changing levels of inflation, which resulted in an increased level of credit
subsidy and in the decapitalization of FIRA for two years; and (b) the
failure to improve its monitoring and evaluation to keep it abreast of its
expanded credit operations.
7.02      As a result of the exporience with the Seventh Project, the
follow-up Eighth Project was approved only after a complete overhaul of
Mexican interest rate policy, which resulted in the General Interest Rate
Agreement (GIRA), signed with GOh in August 1984 (para. 3.09). Also, FIRA
has revised its sample for measuring the impact of its lending (para. 3.11).
4/  Tie Borrower observes that focus of Bank supervision on administrative
and financial aspects helped make it possible to take major decisions which
avoided a major deterioration in FIRA's financial condition. However, tech-
nical field supervision which the project required was not given and for this,
in some cases, foreign experts would have been useful. See Borrower's comment
#9.

Mr. Graham Donaldson

World Bank
Washington, D.C.
I reLer to your letter of April 3, 1989, in which the Bank furnished
this Institution with the Project Completion Report on the Seventh
Agricultural Credit Project (Loan 1891-ME), and invited comments for
consideration during the preparation of the final version to be submitted to
the Bank's Board of Executive Directors.
I therefore enclose the comments and opinions of the implementing
agency, the guarantor and the borrower, who studied the document jointly.
It must be emphasized that the project was executed at a time when
the country was facing very difficult economic circumstances, requiring
adjustments in macroeconomic policy thet affected the progress of the Seventh
Project.
Yours, etc.

COMMENTS ON THE PROJECT COMPLETION REPORT
OF THE SEVENTH AGRICULTURAL CREDIT PROJECT
(LOAN 1891-ME)
GENERAL
(1)       We agree with the Report that the Project was executed at a time
when the country was facing very difficult economic circumstances. This
necessitated adjustments in macroeconomic policy which affected the execution
of the Seventh Project.
(2)       The Report places emphasis on the behavior of interest rates in
Mexico at a time of high inflation. Consequently, the Bank must establish the
right context when describing this situation, including the following factors:
(a) The external debt crisis;
(b) an increasing budget deficit causing inflationary pressure;
(c) the macroeconomic adjustment program;
(d) the impossibility of adjusting interest rates, because this also
would l-il to inflationary pressure.
(3)       The Report repeatedly states that FIRA's system for measuring
project impact was inadequate. Nevertheless, and as the Bank well kiows, very
few of the Bank's project implementation agencies have succeeded for such a
long period as FIRA in maintaining a system for measuring the results of
credit operations, this having been established in 1976. The advantage of the
system is that data on borrowers is gathered in a constant and ongoing manner,
in contrast to other systems that collect information only sporadically.
Similarly, because other countries lacked experience of such issues,
FIRA applied for the specialized assistance of Bank staff on several
occasions, but received no response to these requests.

"O 'On three OcidSion --- agreed *ot to submit disbursement                 v          As in the case ot (1) above. it should be noted that interest rate
requests."                                                                       adjustments implemented by the Mexican Government made it ispossible
to fulfill the conditions agreed with the Bank. and for this reason
the planned disbursements could not be made.
" loty pertent ot the loaf amount-"                                    v          It must be pointed out that the agreements allow for a postponement ot
the Loan c osing date. if any eventuality should occur.
"(, -4.quIit l y, t he sample was no longer a rel iable               v           This contradicts the comments of the Bank itself in Part IV ("'Project
, it idtor oI the t inancial or ecoriomic impact of the loans.-                  Impact"). since the latter refers to the Project's considerable
achievements with regard to output and economic rates of return.

t.      ,tt.  s.pervi%ioii missions have frequently found..."              vi          Ihis assertion is incorrect.  As the World Bank knows. the Methodology
for calculating producers' net income was in fact designed jointly by
World Bank and FIRA and has been used in an identical foru in other
Projects. As part of FIRA's normal supervisory activities, the
calculations of net inctmes are reviewed. and if any anmalies are
found. the cases in question are reclassified.  Various fores of
penalty can be applied to participating banks and to staff. including    0
retirement of subloans, imposition of penalty interest on banks, and
withdrawal of the staff mmber's authorization.
Consequently, we suggest that section (b) of this paragraph. and other
references made to this matter in the 'eemainder of the Report. be
removed.
"Houweve.-, 1IRA Idiled to exert..."                                   vi         It must be pointed out that FIRA's activities should at no time be
assumed to affect BANRURAL's operations. since the two institutions
are independent and have their own operAting rules.
1fH)  "he side letter providing for..."                                    5/3.08      The side letter was not applied precisely because macrecoeomic policy
affected interest rates.
t     B1 'Blailk supervision missions..-'                                 11/6.04       It should be noted that Bank supervision work was basically directed
toward administrative and financial issues. and provided valuable              * is
