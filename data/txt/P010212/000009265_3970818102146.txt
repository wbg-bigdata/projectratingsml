_,Ms:                  Repayable in 20 years, including five years of grace
at the standard variable interest rate.
1ject Description:    The proposed project, which would assist WAPDA in the
further reinforcement and expansion of the secondary
transmission network, thereby reducing transmission
losses, consists of (a) the erection of about 3,815 km
of transmission line, (b) the construction of 139 new
substations, (c) the extension and reinforcement of
another 86 existing substations, and (d) studies, train-
ing and technical assistance to Ci) prepare an invest-
ment program for reducing losses in the transmission
network, (ii) prepare a program of action ta improve
power plant efficiency (iii) strengthen WAPDA's account-
ing capabilities and modernize its internal audit sys-
tem, and (iv) formulate a national least cost plan for
the power subsector. The proposed project consists of
normal electric utility work entailing no unusual risks
and there should be no difficulty in its execution.
Under the Third WAPDA project, WAPDA has built up and
demonstrated the capability to design and execute the
planned program. The likelihood of serious delays or
substantial cost overruns is therefore considered to be
minimal.

FOURTH WAPDA POWER PROJECT
STAFF APPRAISAL REPORT
I. ENERGY RESOURCES
A. Overview
1.01    Pakistan's commercially exploitable domestic energy resources consist
of hydro power and natural gas, which account for a major share of these
resources, followed by oil and coal. In addition, the country has a substan-
tial non-conventional energy resource base, consisting mainly of fuelwood,
agricultural and animal waste, and solar and wind energy. To date, these
resources are, by and large, underutilized and their development has
progressed at a substantially slower pace than is warranted by the size of
the reserves, mainly because of financial constraints and the absence of a
comprehensive plar outlining priorities for development. These issues will
be addressed under the Bank's future lending operations such as the proposed
Energy Sector Loan, whose purpose would be to ensure that high priority
projects are implemented by making available resources for their initiation
and/or completion and by setting a timetable for actions and measures to be
taken by GOP to address the major sectoral issues.
Hydropower
1.02    Pakistan's hvdro power potential is estimated at about 30,000 MW,
divided among several sites, ranging between 100 MW and 2,500 MW in size. Of
this only 2,547 MW has been developed, 350 MW is under construction and
another 8,100 MW is expected to be exploited by the year 2000. Prior to
1981, the development of hydro power potential was carried out on a
site-by-site basis, with the large sites such as Tarbela and Mangla being
selected for their individual contribution to the domestic supply of energy.
As a result, hydro and thermal capacities were not fully integrated and the
development of the power subsector had started to deviate from its least cost
path. In recognition of this, GOP, under financing from the Canadian Inter-
national Development Agency (CIDA), commissioned Montreal Engineering, a
Canadian firm, in 1981 to undertake a study to evaluate the sites on the
Indus River with potential greater than 200 NW and to rank them in terms of
cost and priority of development. The results of the study are expected by
March 1985. These results will be critical to the formulation of the
national least cost program for the development of the power subsector, and
the identification of projects suitable for Bank financing (para 2.05).



-2-
Consequently, GOP and WAPDA agreed to review with the Bank the results of the
hydro ranking study by not later than June 30, 1985, and identify the
priority schemes, their sequencing, and the timetable for their preparation
and development (para 6.01).
Hydrocarbons
1.03    Natural gas is Pakistan's main commercially exploitable energy
resource, with total remaining reserves estimated at about 340 million toe,
of which 92Z is non-asso_iated gas. Unless new reserves are discoverei and
assuming that the current annual extraction rates are sustained, the remain-
ing reserves would be exhausted in about 20 years. Proven reserves of oil,
by contrast, are modest, estimated at about 10 million tons, sufficient for
about two years of consumption. In addition to the proven reserves, probable
reserves at known fields are estimated at about three million tons and pos-
sible reserves at about six million tons. Although the prospects for new oil
discoveries are fair and the potential for significant new gas discoveries is
good, an expanded exploration program would have to be implemented in order
to increase the domestic output of oil and gas. Since public sector invest-
ment is constrained by the shortage of financial resources, private sector
involvement would have to be increased in order to achieve that objective.
This, to a large extent, will depend upon the adoption of improved pricing
policies, especially for gas. rn addition, since the implementation
capability of the Oil and Gas Development Corporation (OGDC), the public
sector enterprise, is expected to be constrained over the medium-term by the
shortage of both financial resources and technical expertise, its efforts
would have to be concentrated on a core investment program, focussing on
exploration and development of high priority areas. For the development of
the remaining prospects, private sector investment, both foreign and local,
would have to be mobilized. The issues relating to gas producer prices, the
composition of the orogram to be implemented by OGDC, and the means for
attracting the private sector will be addressed by the Bank through its
future lending operations to the petroleum subsector.
Coal
1.04    Pakistan's coal and lignite reserves are estimated at about 835
million tons, including 728 milLion tons of probable and possible reserves,
and 107 million tons of proven reserves. Although these estimates are not
based on reliable and standardized data, the prospects for increasing the
output of coal are good. This, however, would require a comprehensive and
systematic coal exploration program to clearly identify both potential reser-
ves and priorities for development. GOP, with the assistance of the United
States Geological Survey, intends to formulate a national coal exploration
program that would define priorities for exploration drilling and geophysical
analysis. As part of this strategy, GOP, under financing from USAID, intends
to undertake between 1985 and 1988 detailed assessment of Lakhra,
Sonda-Thatta, the Salt Range and the Makerwal region. The scope of work,
timetable and terms of reference will be reviewed by the Bank.



-3-
Uranium
1.05    The only available estimate of uranium resources dates £rom 1976,
when resources with a cut-off grade of 0.1% uranium oxide U308 were estimated
at 150,000 tons of mineralized material, containing 181 tons of uranium
metal. Pakistan Atomic Energy Commission (PAEC) is exploring two relatively
large reserves which, it is hoped, would be sufficient to provide fuel for a
sizeable nuclear power program.
Renewable Energy Resources
1.06    Renewable energy resources have traditionally supplied more than 50%
of the country's total energy requirements. Although detailed data on
non-commercial energy by fuel type and sector are sparse, it is estimated
that it accounted for about 36% of the overall supply of energy in 1983.
Non-commercial fuels will continue to meet a large oart of the energy needs
of rural households in the future, but their share is expected to decline
relative to that of commercial energy. The government has recently been
analyzing and experimenting with the more productive utilization of renewable
energy resources. These developments, however, are at the exploratory stage
and are unlikely to have a significant impact on the overall energy picture
in the near future.
B. Organization of the Energy Sector
1.07    The energy sector is highly fragmented with a multiplicity of
,ntities operating and in some cases overlapping so that coordination within
the sector is difficult. Three ministries share the responsibility for
supervising the operational entities and agencies involved in the energy
sector. These are the Ministry of Petroleum and Natural Resources (MPNR),
the Ministry of Production (MOP), and the Ministry of Water and Power (MWP).
In addition, the Energy Division of the Ministry of Planning and Development
(MPD) has responsibility for energy planning. Operational responsibilities
in the sector are vested in a large number of entities and agencies in both
the public and the private sectors. As shown in the organization chart in
Annex 1.1, all these entities and agencies, except for three state organiza-
tions engaged in oil refining or petrochemicals, the two electricity supply
organizations and the Appropriate Technology Development Corporation come
under the jurisdiction of MPNR. Nuclear energy comes under the Office of the
Chief Martial Law Administrator. Coordination between the ministries on
energy matters is secured through a number of committees, namely the National
Energy Policy Committee (NEPC), the Economic Coordination Committee (ECC),
the Executive Committee of the National Economic Council (ECNEC), and the
Central Development Working Party (CDWP). NEPC is responsible for the for-
mulation of GOP's energy policy. The review of the financial plans of the
sector and the approval of energy pricing proposals is under the jurisdiction
of ECC. ECNEC and CDWP review major proposals in the energy sector, as in
other sectors.
1.08    Thus, the main issue concerning the organization of the energy sector
is the multiplicity of ministries and committees responsible for planning,
coordinating and monitoring the performance of the public and private
enterprises involved in the production, transport and delivery of energy



-4-
products. This division of responsibility spreads the scarce human resour-
ces, particularly at the technical level, among a large number of public
agencies, thus denying the sector the critical mass needed for close coor-
dination of plans and management. Efforts have been undertaken by GOP to
rectify this by creating an energy planning cell (ENERPLAN) at MPD and an
energy conservation unit (ENERCON) at MOP under financing from USAID. The
Bank will review the scope of work, terms of reference and the timetable for
the work to be undertaken by ENERPLAN and ENERCON and monitor the progress
made.
C. Supply and Consumption of Commercial Energy
1.09    Pakistan's gross supply of commercial energy, comprising domestic
production and imports, increased during the period 1978-1983 at an average
annual rate of about 8%, from 12,049 thousand toe to 17,760 thousand toe. In
1978, about 61% of the gross supply of commercial energy was produced domes-
tically and the remaining 39%, consisting mainly of petroleum products, was
imported. The corresponding figures for 1983 were 65% and 35%, respectively.
The decline in the relative share of imported energy was largely due to the
rapid increase in the supply of natural gas and hydro, with the former
increasing from 1,786 thousand toe in 1978 to 2,705 thousand toe in 1983 and
the latter from 4,453 thousand toe to 7,695 thousand toe. Despite this
increase, severe shortages of natural gas and electricity were experienced
during the last two years of the Fifth Five-Year Plan (1978-1983). These
shortages were attributed to the unprecedented growth of consumption,
precipitated by COP's pricing policies which distorted the relative structure
of prices.  These shortages were further exacerbated by financial con-
straints, stemming from unanticipated increase in government outlays for
ongoing projects, which induced GOP to substantially scale down the invest-
ment program for the power subsector. This, in turn, prompted the utilities
I/ to allocate the limited resources to expanding their generating capacity
and the transmission and distribution networks rather than to improving their
efficiency through retrofitting, rehabilitation and reinforcement. As a
result, losses in the production, transmission and distribution of elec-
tricity increased over the Fifth Five Year Plan from 21% of gross energy
consumption in 1978 to 23% in 1983. Energy balances for 1978 and 1983,
describing the changes in the supply and consumption of energy during the
Fifth Five-Year Plan, are presented in Annexes 1.2 and 1.3.
D. Energy Pricing
1.10    Each enterprise in the energy sector is responsible for setting its
own price at levels that cover its costs, generate sufficient revenue for its
investment program and earn an acceptable rate of return on its assets. In
practice, however, all changes in the structure and level of prices must be
reviewed by the ministry concerned and approved by the Cabinet. Up to 1980,
1/ Refer to both, the Water and Power Development Authority (WAPDA) and the
Karachi Electricity Supply Corporation (KESC).



-5-
GOP buffered the economy from the full impact of the higher cost of imported
energy, which started increasing after the oil embargo of 1973, by maintain-
ing the upward adjustments in the prices of domestic energy products at
levels that were substantially below the increases in the prices of imported
energy and the general price level. As a result, prices of domoestic energy
products decreased in real terms between 1973 and 1979, which seriously
distorted the structure of the relative prices of competing fuels such as
fuel oil, natural gas and coal. In 1980, GOP decided to rationalize the
consumption and supply of energy by increasing the prices of petroleum
products, natural gas, coal and electricity. Domestic prices of energy
products such as gasoline, diesel fuel oil and natural gas were increased at
rates that, on the average, exceeded the increase in the general price level.
This has addressed some of the inconsistencies in the prices of energy, but
considerable work is still required to eliminate the prevailing distortion in
the structure of prices, particularly of electricity and gas. In recognizing
the need for consistent and systematic adjustment in the structure and level
of prices, the Sixth Five-Year plan has set as one of its objectives the
achievement of parity between domestic prices of energy and border prices or
economic cost, whichever is applicable (para 1.14).
1.11    Petroleum Products and Gas:  The petroleum subsector has been a net
contributor to the resources of GOP since 1973. In 1985, the weighted
average domestic price of petroleum products was at 150% of the border price,
US$362/toe compared to US$242/toe. Under the prevailing price structure,
prices of all petroleum products are above their respective border prices,
with the exception of fuel oil which is below its border price by about
US$22/toe. The relationship between domestic and border prices of petroleum
products is summarized in Annex 1.4. Domestic prices of gas have tradition-
ally been kept below their opportunity cost which is assumed in the case of
Pakistan to be equal to the border price of fuel oil. GOP agreed under SAL I
to move the price of gas to reach two-thirds the border price of fuel oil by
1988. As a result, the weighted average domestic price of gas has increased
since 1980 at an average annual rate of 23Z. 1/ The weighted price of
natural gas in January 1985 was about 40% of the border price of fuel oil,
that is, US$66.6/toe compared to US$170/toe.
1.12    Electricity:  The weighted average electricity tariffs in Pakistan,
for both Water and Power Development Authority (WAPDA) and Karachi Electric
Supply Corporation (KESC), increased in real terms between 1973 and 1983 at
an average annual rate of 1.8%, from 13.96 paise/kWh in 1973 to 16.6
paise/kWh in 1983 for WAPDA and from 16.1 paise/kWh to 26.4 paise/kWh for
KESC. The real tariffs increased during this period for all consumer
categories, except households. In January 1984, the average revenue was 63
paise/kWh for WAPDA and 98 paise/kWh for KESC, representing 63% and 98Z of
the average long-run marginal cost (LRMC) of about 100 paise/kWh for the
combined system. Despite the divergence between the average revenue and
LRMC, WAPDA has been able to finance more than 40% of its investment program
from its internally generated revenues because the formula for calculating
1/ Specifically, in 1982, nominal increase in the price of gas was 19% for
industry, 17Z for the commercial consumers and 17% for households. In
1983, the corresponding increases were 58%, 35% and 14Z, respectively.

internal cash generation is retrospective rather than prospective and actual
investments in the past have amounted to about 50Z of the planned investment.
These shortcomings are being addressed under the Project in that WAPDA has
agreed to substitute a forward looking cash generation covenant starting FY89
for the existing backward looking cash generation covenant (para 4.02).
Moreover, GOP has agreed to a Rs 30 billion investment program for WAPDA,
covering the period FY86-FY88 and to undertake all necessary measures includ-
ing tariff increases and annual allocations from the budget to ensure that
the program is financed. (para 6.03). This investment program would require
a tariff increase, net of fuel surcharge, of 11% for FY86, 15Z for FY87, and
18% for FY88 in order to achieve the 40% level of internal cash generation
agreed to under this Project (para 4.02). The Bank's estimates show that if
tariff increases are dictated by the incernal cash generation covenant and
are based on the agreed investment program, average tariffs would achieve
parity with long-run marginal cost (LRMC) by 1989.
1.13    A tariff study was undertaken jointLy by WAPDA and the Bank in
1979-1980 to estimate the LRMC. The results of the study have been used to
correct some of the distortions in the structure of electricity tariffs.
Currenitly, WAPDA is updating that study in compliance with an agreement with
ADB under the Guddu combined cycle project. The results of the study are
expected by June 1985, at which time they would be reviewed by both the Bank
and ADB, and an action program and timetable for restructuring tariffs would
be agreed upon with GOP and WAPDA. The Bank is currently collaborating with
WAPDA in assessing the impact of hydro power development programs and the
different mechanisms for covering the capital cost of this development on
electricity tariffs. In addition, GOP, in close collaboration with the Bank,
is currently assessing the impact on WAPDA's tariffs of having a large share
of the new thermal capacities based on imported coal.1/ This would reduce the
incremental cost of fuel substantially, and in turn, the LRMC. Completion of
the work is expected by October 1985. Moreover, a load research and manage-
ment study aimed at redesigning the tariff structure in order to shift
non-essential consumers from peak to off-peak periods would be initiated
under the Bank's future lending operations to WAPDA.
E. Energy Planning and Development Strategy
1.14    In recognition of the fact that shortages of energy, like those
experienced during the last two years of the Fifth Five-Year Plan, could
become a major impediment to sustaining the growth momentum, GOP assigned
high priority to restructuring the energy sector during the Sixth Five-Year
Plan (1983-1988). Specifically, the objectives of the plan are:
(a) accelerate the development of domestic energy resources to reduce the
country's dependence on imported energy; (b) promote efficient and rational
use of energy and meet the future demand for energy at least cost to the
national economy; (c) raise energy prices to reflect border prices for trade-
able products and economic costs of supply for non-tradeable energy products;
1/ The study would also include a strategy for eliminating the prevailing
differential in tariffs charged by KESC and WAPDA by exploring the pos-
sibility of a national tariff level and structure and outlining a scheme
for ensuring the financial viability of both entities.



-7-
and (d) streamline the organization of the energy sector to promote its
efficieant operation and management. In keeping with these objectives, GOP
has ta*Len several important policy initiatives in the areas of resource
development, pricing and demand management, and institutional development to
ensure the achievement of the current plan targets, which are presented in
Annex 1.5. These actions, which underscore GOP commitment to restructuring
the energy sector, have addressed some of the constraints responsible for the
shortfalls in achieving the targets of the Fifth Five-Year Plan. However,
despite the Government's efforts, serious shortfalls are expected to occur in
the supply of energy during the current Plan, particularly in the power
subsector where only 80 of the supply targets are expected to be realized by
1988. The projected shortfall in the suppLy of eLectricity is due to the
shortage of financial resources stemming from both the inadequate financial
resources mobilized through tariffs and the insufficient allocations to the
subsector from the Annual Development Program (ADP). As a result, GOP has
adopted a revised three year plan for the period 1986-1988 to identify core
investment programs for each energy subsector and earmark resources for their
implementation to minimize the shortfaLls during the Sixth Five-Year Plan and
to ensure a smooth transition to the Seventh Five-Year Plan. The Bank,
through this Project and the ongoing sector dialogue would address, among
others, issues relating to resource mobilization and annual allocation to the
subsector through agreements on financial performance covenants (para 4.02)
and on a core investment program for the period FY86-FY88 (para 1.12).
F. The Bank Group Involvement
1.15    The Bank Group involvement in Pakistan's energy sector started in
1955, with a loan to KESC for the construction of a thermal power station.
Since then, it has assisted in financing projects in all subsectors of
energy. In the power subsector, the Bank has participated in the Indus Basin
Development Projects, which include the hydrogeneration capacities at MIangla
and Tarbela. A series of four credits/loans were made to KESC between 1955
and 1967 for the development of its generation capacities. Since 1970, the
Bank has been more directly involved in GOP's program for strengthening the
power transmission and distribution networks, for which three credits/loans
were made to WAPDA. The first credit (213-PAK) for WAPDA of US$23 million,
made in 1970, covered the cost of upgrading the capacity of the transmission
network. A second lending operation for WAPDA power, a Third Window loan
(Loan 1208T-PAK) of US$50 million, subsequently reduced by US$15 million due
to savings achieved under international competitive bidding, was made in 1975
to finance the development of part of the 500-kV transmission system to
connect the hydro resources of the north with the thermal generation in the
center and south to provide the most economic means of supplying power
throughout the country. A third lending operation to WAPDA (968-PAK) was
made to cover four years of its program for the development of the secondary
transmission (FY79-FY83), involving the erection of 2,700 miles of single and
double circuit lines and the construction, expansion and conversion of 216
substations. Implementation of this Project is progressing satisfactorily
and completion is expected in 1985.
1.16    Over the course of its involvement in the power subsector, the Bank
has directed its efforts to institution building to strengthen KESC's and
WAPDA's management and technical capabilities. WAPDA has improved its over-
alL financial operations through developing modern accounting and commercial



-8-
systems. Moreover, WAPDA is now capable of undertaking the design and
implementation of the projects for the development of the transmission net-
work. The role of the Bank in the Project would be to continue supporting
the institution building measures already undertaken by WAPDA, including the
strengthening of technical capability in formulating a least cost plan for
the development of the power subsector. Moreover, since the Bank concurs
with the objectives of the Sixth Five-Year Plan, its role would be to ensure
that future lending focus on high priority projects that would assist GOP in
achieving its objecti-es. In the area of primary energy production, the Bank
would support the imp:ementation of a comprehensive plan for the exploration
and development of hydrocarbons and coal. In addition, the Bank would sup-
port an investment program aimied at the substitution of lower-value products,
particularly imported coal for gas in power generation and to release the gas
for use by industry and household as a substitute for imported petroleum
products. As for hydro potential, emphasis would be on the formulation of a
least cost plan, and on the extension of technical and financial support for
the exploitation of high priority schemes.  In the production of secondary
energy, efforts will be directed toward supporting the implementation of a
comprehensive plan for improving the efficiency of power plants and for the
rehabilitation and reinforcement of the transmission networks to reduce
losses. Efforts would also be directed toward retrofitting and restructuring
the refinery subsector, as well as the rationalization of the infrastructure
for the transport of liquid hydrocarbons and gas. As for consumption, the
Bank would support the formulation of plans for bringing domestic prices of
energy products to parity with their respective cost to the economy to
rationalize consumption and mobilize resources for GOP, and for investing in
rehabilitation and retrofitting in major energy consuming industries, such
as fertilizers, cement, etc.
(I. THE BORROWER
Organization of WAPDA
2.01    WAPDA, the beneficiary, is a semi-autonomous agency established in
1958 to coordinate the development of Pakistan's water and power resources.
It is divided into two largely independent 'wings', one for power and the
other for water (Annex 2.1). The Power Wing is responsible for the construc-
tion and operation of power generation, transmission and distribution
facilities throughout the country, except for the Karachi area which is
supplied by KESC. The Water Wing is responsible for the overall planning and
investigation of water resources, and the design and construction of surface
and groundwater development projects for the federal and provincial govern-
ments. WAPDA's governing body, referred to as the "Authority", consists of a
chairman and three members, who are in charge of power, water and finance,
respectively. The members are appointed by the Government and act as chief
executives of their respective groups.
2.02    The Power Wing's member of the Authority, referred to as Member
Power, is assisted by seven general managers in charge of generation, trans-
mission, distribution, finance, coordination and planning, design and protec-
tion, and inventory control. The organization of the Power Wing is shown in
Annex 2.2. The first general manager for finance was appointed only four



-9-
years ago, and the position of general manager for inventory control is an
even more recent position. In January 1985, the Power Wing had about 88,000
employees, including 2,100 engineers, 700 other professionals, 9,200 techni-
cal and other staff, 15,000 administrative and accounts staff, 44,000 skilled
and 17,000 general staff. The number of consumers served by WAPDA in January
1985 was about 3.7 million, representing about 42 consumers per employee.
This ratio is relatively high, mainly because of the overstaffing in the
distribution department which is the largest department. In January 1985,
the distribution department had 62,455 employees, representing 70% of the
Power Wing's total. The distribution department includes the staff of the
eight Area Electricity Boards (AEBs), which were set up in 1981 to take over
the responsibility for local electricity service. Each AEB has its own
chairman, who is the chief engineer for the area, appointed by WAPDA for a
five-year term; three full-time members, who are also directors in charge of
departments; and three part-time members representing local interests, one of
whom is normally a representative of the Provincial Government. The members
are appointed for a period of three years.
2.03    GOP has recently started to review the means for reorganizing the
power subsector. The preliminary thinking was to transfer the responsibility
of distribution to the municipalities, leaving WAPDA to concentrate on gener-
ation and transmission. This scheme was rejected by the municipalities.
Since then, GOP has explored the possibility of attracting the private sector
to take over the distribution of electricity throughout the country and
assign WAPDA the responsibility for the generation and transmission of elec-
tricity for the entire country. This would require KESC to divest its gener-
ation facilities and restrict its operations to the bulk purchase of power
from WAPDA and to its distribution in its concession area. The details of
this plan have not been outlined and further work is needed before such an
arrangement could be given serious consideration. The scope for increasing
private sector involvement in the power subsector is substantial and its
encouragement would assist GOP in mobilizing badly needed investment for the
development of the power subsector. The increased participation of the
private sector in the power subsector is consistent with COP's goals as
outlined in the Sixth Five-Year Plan. The difficulties experienced by GOP in
attracting the private sector stem from the fact that discussions with the
private sector, including KESC, were carried out in general terms without a
blueprint that would serve as a basis for the negotiations, especially in
delineating responsibilities, outlining the compensation packages, setting
financial targets, internal cash generation, staffing, etc. In order to
assist GOP and WAPDA in formulating a plan for the reorganization of WAPDA's
distribution department, consultants have been recruited, under USAID financ-
ing, to initiate a study to outline a plan for the decentralization of power
distribution in Pakistan (para 2.10). The results and recommendations of the
study will be reviewed with the Bank.
Existing Systems
2.04    In January 1985, WAPDA's total installed generating capacity was
4,052 MW, of which 2,547 MW (63%) was hydro and the balance 1,505 MW (37%)
was thermal. The maximum potential output of the hydro stations amounts to
about 2,800 MW when all reservoirs are full. This potential drops to
slightly less than 1,000 MW during the dry seasons, which not only requires



-10-
the maintenance of adequate thermal capacity, but also results in con-
siderable load shedding. The high voltage transmission grid in operation
consists of 850 km of 500-kV lines and 1,300 km of 220-kY lines. The sub-
transmission system, which is operated at 132, 66 and 33-kV, extends over
nearly 15,030 km. In addition, there are 415 grid substations in operation,
totalling about 12,000 MVA. Power is distributed at 11-kV and at 400 volts.
In many parts of the distribution system the conductors are too small for the
load, and transformers are overloaded. Most problems occur in the older
portions of the system, where much of the equipment is as much as 50 years
old. The newer parts have been built to modern standards. USAID is cur-
rently financing a project to strengthen WAPDA's distribution system (para
2.10). Prior to 1973 only 2,553 villages had been electrified, or about 6Z
of the total number of villages (43,327) in the country. An accelerated
village electrification program was started in FY73, and was intensified in
FY77. The annual rate of electrification rose from 295 villages in 1973 to
1,986 in 1983, resulting in a nearly five-fold increase in the number of
villages electrified in WAPDA's service area to over 14,000. Another 1,182
villages have been electrified under a special Government program for
Federally Administered Tribal Areas (FATA).
Power Planning
2.05    WAPDA has a power planning department in its Power Wing.  Consult-
ants, financed mostly by bilateral assistance, especially CIDA and USAID, are
or have been recently employed in several power planning studies, including
extensions to Tarbela, the Kalabagh combined power and irrigation project,
the Lakhra coal mine and power station development, and a prefeasibility
study to assess the viability of installing a thermal power station based on
imported coal in the vicinity of Karachi. WAPDA, assisted by consultants,
has also investigated the potential for installing low head hydro power at
barrages and canals. Consultants have also been engaged to evaluate poten-
tial hydro sites greater than 200 MW in size on the Indus River and rank them
in terms of cost and priority of development (para 1.02). The results of
this study, which were recently made available, have prompted WAPDA to
initiate a feasibility study and detailed engineering for the site at Basha.
Under UNDP financing, with the Bank as the executing agency, Argonne
Laboratories have formulated an interim least-cost program for the develop-
ment of generation and primary transmission facilities, which incorporates
the preliminary results of the hydro ranking study. Argonne, under the
auspices of the International Atomic Energy Agency, has also trained four of
WAPDA's staff in the use of the WASP III zomputer model for system planning
and have successfully installed that model in WAPDA's computer in January
1985. This will enable WAPDA's staff to formulate a national least-cost plan
for the power subsector and incorporate the information on the operation of
the subsector, including hydrology, water management and pattern of elec-
tricity consumption, all of which is presently being collected and refined.
In view of the importance of such a plan to setting priorities and earmarking
resources for their implementation to meet the forecast demand for elec-
tricity at least cost to the economy, WAPDA agreed to initiate a study by
June 30, 1985, under terms of reference acceptable to the Bank, to formulate
a national least-cost plan for the power subsector and to complete the study
and review its results with the Bank by June 30, 1986 (para 6.02).



-11-
2.06    In 1977, WAPDA's losses in the tiansmission and distribution networks
amounted to 34.7% of gross generation. These were attributed to insufficient
high voltage transmission lines, the need for some transmission lines to be
upgraded to higher voltages, the small number of substations, lack of power
factor correction equipment, distribution systems that were underbuilt,
missing or defective meters, theft of power, and low power factors of con-
sumers' loads. WAPDA agreed under Credit 968-PAK to introduce a program for
reducing losses in the transmission and distribution networks from 34.7% to
21Z by 1984.  Prggress has been made in reducing transmission and distribu-
tion losses. The first section of the 500-kV grid (Tarbela-Faisalabad) has
been completed. The 220-kV system has been extended and the link between
Faisalabad and Jamshoro is presently being upgraded to 500-kV. Subtransmis-
sion lines and substations have been added at many places, allowing the
distribution feeders to be shorter. Also, capacitors are being added to the
11-kV circuits. About 1200 MVAR of capacitors have been purchased for grid
stations, of which about 800 MVAR had been installed by the end of FY83.
Another 2,250 MVAR will be added by the end of FY88 to improve the system
power factor to 90%. Losses due to theft have also been reduced con-
siderably. Increased demand charges are making it worthwhile for consumers
to improve their power factors. Despite these improvements, progress has not
been rapid enough to attain the program target of 21% by FY84. The shortfall
in achieving the target is due to the following three reasons. First, the
implementation of the high voltage transmission network has been slower than
foreseen because of financial constraints; second, the implementation of the
improvements and extensions to the subtransmission grid (STG) under the
Second and Third WAPDA Power projects, were delayed due to late employment of
consultants and delays in awarding contracts (para 1.15); and third, very
little was done to reduce technical losses at the distribution level. As
shown in Table 2.1, losses in the transmission and distribution networks
still amounted to about 27% of energy generated in FY83.

The completion of the work of extending the high-voltage transmission net-
work, particularLy the ongoing and proposed extension of the 500-kV links
(para 2.08) and the commissioning of new STC lines and substations, along
with the installation of capacitors, is expected to further reduce the lop
ses, but these would be insufficient for WAPDA to reach the Third Project
target of 21% by FY84. Although WAPDA continues to assess the transmission
line designs to ensure that the remaining lines to be built under the Third
Project as well as those under this Project are of optimum design, further
reductions in losses are not likely to materialize because WAPDA lacks
experience in identifying the sources of energy losses and in designing a



-12-
comprehensive investment plan for reinforcing, rehabilitating and retrofit-
ting the network. It also has no experience in preparing a program for the
rehabilitation of thermal power stations in order to improve their
efficiency. Given that GOP has set as its target the promotion of energy
conservation, WAPDA should initiate a plan for improving its energy
efficiency. WAPDA agreed to engage consuLtants with terms of reference satis-
factory to the Bank by July 31, 1985, and to complete with their assistance
by July 31, 1986 a study aimed at identifying the sources of energy losses in
its transmission sys -m, quantifying such losses, determining the optimum
levels of such losse., and producing detailed work and investment programs,
as necessary, to achieve such optimum levels. WAPDA also agreed to engage
consultants with terms of reference satisfactory to the Bank by June 30, 1985
and prepare with their assistance, by June 30, 1986, programs of work and
investment to optimize the thermal efficiency of WAPDA's existing thermal
power stations (para 6.02). The loss reduction study, together with the
USAID-financed Rural Electrification Project, which calls for the rehabilita-
tion and reinforcement of WAPDA's distribution network (paras 2.09 and 2.10),
would identify a more consistent and attainable target, an implementation
schedule and the investments required to achieve that target. Until these
studies are completed and reviewed with the Bank, a target for loss reduction
has been set to induce WAPDA to continue its loss reduction efforts. This
target, however, could be revised, depending upon the results of the studies.
WAPDA has agreed to take all necessary measures aimed at reducing its system
losses to 21X by 1988 and to review and revise the targets, as necessary,
once the results of the studies become available (para 6.02).
WAPDA's Development Program
2.07    Planned Generation:  Annex 2.3 gives details of the forecast energy
and capacity balance as appraised by the Bank on the basis of an updated
implementation schedule. The installed capacity is expected to grow from
4,052 MW in 1984 to 9,416 MW in 1993. Projects under construction include
additional extension at Tarbela (units 9-10, 2 x 175 MW), a steam unit (Guddu
4, 210 MW) and a combined cycle group (450 MW) at Guddu, a steam unit (Jam-
shoro-1, 250 MW) at Jamshoro and a set of combustion turbines (4 x 100 MW)
at Kot Addu. Financing has been secured for these projects and they should
be commissioned during the Sixth Five-Year Plan. In addition, a number of
projects to be commissioned in the Seventh and Eighth Five-Year Plans would
also have to be initiated during the Sixth Five-Year Plan. These include
hydro projects such as additional extensions at Tarbela (units 11-14, 4 x 406
MW), a final stage at Mangla (units 9-10, 2 x 100 MW) and thermal projects
such as a fuel fired station at Multan (3 x 210 MW), the Lakhra coal-fired
station (300 MW) and development of other thermal stations at or around
Karachi and at mid-county, using imported fuel oil and/or coal. However
since financing has not been secured for most of these projects, some slip-
page is expected to occur in their commissioning. As a result, the projected
expansion of generating capacity will not be able to meet the energy require-
ments during the next four years, even under average hydrological conditions,
and load shedding would continue to be enforced in the dry season when the
shortfall is expected to be most severe.
2.08    Transmission.   The salient feature of the power system in Pakistan
is that major hydro resources are located in the north of the country and
thermal facilities and electricity loads are concentrated in the center and



-13-
the south. This will continue to require bulk transmission of electricity
over distances of about 1,600 km. In order to ensure efficient evacuation of
power, WAPDA's long-term plans call for the development of 4,400 km of high
voltage (500-kV) primary transmission lines by 1991. Of these, 2,550 km are
in operation at 500-kV or 220-kV, are under construction or are being
upgraded. The remaining 1,850 km are planned for 1985-1991. The 220-kV
network and sub-transmission systems would be expanded during the period
1986-89 under this Project (para 3.03).
2.09    Distribution:  Under the Sixth Five-Year Plan, GOP proposes to add
about 2.8 million consumers to the 3.9 million who were served by WAPDA and
0.6 million by KESC at the end of 1983. In the same period, GOP plans to
increase the number of villages electrified by 15,000, from 16,400 to 31,400.
In its review of the Sixth Five-Year Plan, the Bank questioned the economic
justification of accelerating the village electrification program when power
deficits are projected to continue through the Plan period. Although USAID
is financing a Rural Electrification Project over the period of the Sixth
Plan, it recognizes that to proceed immediately with GOP's rural electri'ica-
tion program would not only overtax the capabilities of WAPDA's distribution
department, but would also make generation deficits worse. Their project,
which consists of five main elements, will address many of the problems of
the distribution department. A notable feature is the scale and extent of
technical and managerial assistance that USAID will provide. A contractor
will supply more than 182 man-years of .ssistance; a core team of 13
expatriates and 28 Pakistani nationals will be present throughout most of the
Plan period, and a number of other expatriate specialists will have short
assignments.
2.10    The first element of the USAID project will be the formulation of
a comprehensive National Rural Electrification Master Plan, and construction
of warehouses and consumer service centers. The second element will cover
the training of WAPDA employees in distribution functions. In addition, a
Distribution Training Institute will be built and its staff trained, and
comprehensive training plans will be developed and implemented for all func-
tions and levels in the distribution department. The third element will
concentrate on the development and initiation of a comprehensive program to
reduce technical energy losses in the distribution network. A management
information system will be established to provide data on circuit capacities
and loads, energy costs from different sources, demand management, and
criteria for sizing conductors and equipment. Losses will be reduced by
rebuilding lines using better construction and larger conductors, applying
capacitors and voltage regulators, and by load management. The fourth ele-
ment of USAID's project involves cofinancing with ADB the Cuddu 450 MW Com-
bined Cycle station, comprising four gas turbines to be commissioned in 1986,
with two steam turbines following in 1988. Once the Cuddu gas turbines are
operational, rural system expansion, under the fifth element of the USAID
project would start. Extensions and new systems will be developed in accord-
ance with the Master Plan, and about 216,000 new consumers are expected to be
connected under the project. Each expansion subproject will be handled under
an individual work order subject to USAID's technical and administrative
acceptance, and an acceptable cost-benefit ratio will be required. The work
will be monitored by engineers retained specially for the purpose. USAID
will reimburse WAPDA for a fixed percentage of the originally estimated cost
upon the completion of each subproject.

III. THE PROJECT
Project Setting
3.01    The acceleration of the development of domestic energy resources,
such as coal and hydro power potential is expected to reduce Pakistan's
dependence on imported energy, but this objective will not be achieved before
the mid-1990s because of the time required for their development (para 2.07).
In the interim, the only option available to GOP is to rationalize the con-
sumption and supply of energy. The power subsector is the largest consumer
of petroleum product and natural gas. Improvements in the efficiency of its
power plants and reductions in the losses in its transmission and distribu-
tion networks are pivotal to GOP's efforts to reduce overall energy consump-
tion of the economy. These losses are mainly due to growth of demand for
electricity, which increased at an average annual rate of 12.3% over the past
five years. This prompted WAPDA to concentrate on the expansion of the
network at the expense of rehabilitation and reinforcement needed to maintain
losses at a technically acceptable level. Currently, losses at the transmis-
sion network are about 9.5X (para 2.06), or about 46% higher than the interim
target of 6.5Z for 1984 agreed to with the Bank under Credit 968-PAK.
Although WAPDA's efforts in reducing these losses are commendable, there is
still a need fo- the formulation and implementation of a comprehensive loss
reduction program involving the reinforcement and rehabilitation of the
existing transmission and distribution network for which additional resources
would be needed. Moreover, since the efficiency of the thermal power sta-
tions is also relatively low, their contribution to the overall supply of
energy could be increased through retrofitting and rehabilitation.
Project Objectives
3.02    The Project would assist WAPDA in the implementation of its ongoing
least-cost program for the reinforcement of the transmission network which
would contribute to the more efficient operation of the power subsector. It
would also continue the institution building efforts initiated under the Bank
Group's earlier lending operations by strengthening WAPDA's capabilities in
formulating and implementing an investment program for improving its energy
efficiency. This would constitute the first step in the rationalization of
the consumption of primary energy and the production and delivery of secon-
dary energy.
Project Description
3.03    The Project covers equipment and material, erection and engineering
services associated with the implementation of a four-year time-slice
(FY86-FY89), which is a part of the program for the reinforcement and expan-
sion of the secondary transmission network. This program would contribute to
the reduction of losses and ensure that power is transmitted at least cost.
The Project also covers studies and technical assistance aimed at the
improvement of the management and operation of the power subsector. Specifi-
cally, the Project consists of:



-15-
(a) the construction of a total of about 3,815 km of transmission
line comprising 280 km at 220-kV, 2,458 km at 132-kY, and
1,077 km at 66-kV;
(b) the construction of 139 new substations and the extension and
reinforcement of another 86 existing substations, adding a
total capacity of about 6,400 MVA;
(c) studies aimed at the preparation of investment programs for
reducing losses in the transmission network; improving power
plant efficiency; strengthening WAPDA's internal audit;
formulating a national least cost plan for the power sub-sector;
(d) the training of some of WAPDA's accounting personnel.
Details are presented in Annex 3.1.
Project Cost
3.04    The Project cost, including price and physical contingencies and
customs duties, is US$592.0 million, while the total financing required,
including also interest during construction, is US$614.0 million. Of the
total financing required, US$236.0 million would be in foreign exchange and
the remaining US$378.0 million would be local cost. These estimates are
based on April 1984 prices.  Escalation of foreign costs was assumed to be
3.5% for calendar year 1984, 8.5% for 1985, 9% for 1986 and 1987, 8.25% for
1988 and 6.75% thereafter. Escalation of local costs was taken as 8% for
FY85, 7% for FY86, 6.5% per annum for FY37, and 62 from FY88 and thereafter.
The total price escalation amounts to 16.9% of the base cost plus physical
contingencies. Physical contingencies were calculated at 5Z for equipment,
material and services, amounting to 5% of the base cost. Duties and taxes
included amount to US$141.4 million. The total Project cost net of taxes and
duties is estimated at US$472.6 million.  A summary of Project cost is
presented in Table 3.1 below and more details are given in Annex 3.2.

Project Financing
3.05    Of the total foreign exchange of the Project of about US$236.0 mil-
lion equivalent, US$100.0 million (42%) would be financed by the Benk, and
US$46.3 million (20Z) through cofinancing, suppliers' credits and bilateral
aid. Rather than using the IBRD loan to finance the studies and training
included in the Project (Annex 3.1), WAPDA would use grant funds provided by
USAID under its Energy Planning and Development Project. Terms of reference
and staffing of consultants for the studies required under this Project and
financed by USAID would be reviewed and cleared by the Bank. Moreover, the
progress made and the results obtained would be monitored in the course of
supervising this Project. WAPDA would bear any cost overruns on the Project,
and GOP will bear the foreign exchange risk. Table 3.2 below surmmarizes the
financing plan for the Project as agreed between GOP, WAPDA and the Bank
during negotiations.

Of the total local cost of the Project of about US$378.0 million, about
US$245.6 million would be financed by WAPDA from its internally generated
cash and the rest, amounting to US$132.4 million, would be covered by loans
from GOP, bearing an interest rate of about 11%.
Project Implementation
3.06    The implementation of the Project would be undertaken by WAPDA
through a special project management team assembled for the execution of the
Third project (Cr. 968-PAK/39-SAC) to be completed by the end of 1985. This
project has enhanced WAPDA's capabilities in planning and executing power
transmission projects. Most of the construction would be carried out by
local contractors whose performance would be monitored by WAPDA's team. In
the areas where local contractors cannot mobilize the resources or lack
experience, installation and erection is expected to be undertaken by WAPDA's
own forces. WAPDA is not expected to have any difficulty in managing and
implementing the Project. The implementation schedule is presented in Annex
3.3.
Project Engineering
3.07    WAPDA has already prepared standard engineering designs, specifica-
tions and bidding documents, using procedures and practices established under
the Third power project. These have been developed with active Bank par-
ticipation and review, and consequently, no difficulty is expected in
entrusting the engineering work to WAPDA.
Procurement
3.08    The Bank loan would be used to finance equipment and materials.
Contracts financed under the proposed loan for the supply of equipment and
materials, construction and erection equipment, and tools would be awarded in
accordance with Bank guidelines for international competitive bidding (ICB).
Local manufacturers are expected to win about 30% of the ICB contracts for
equipment and materials, and for purposes of bid comparison, a preference
limited to 15% of the CIF price of imported goods, or the customs duty,
whichever is lower, would be extended to local manufacturers. Minor quan-
tities of standard equipment and materials, and tools, also financed under
the proposed loan, not exceeding US$50,000 each and in the aggregate not
exceeding the equivalent of US$500,000, would be procured through limited
international bidding (LIB) by inviting quotations from at least three sup-
pliers from eligible countries. Bidding documents and recommendations for
the award of contracts exceeding the equivalent of US$250,000 to be financed
by the Bank would be subject to prior approval by the Bank. Contracts not
subject to ICB or special arrangements will be awarded using the Borrower's
local competitive bidding procedures, which are satisfactory.

Disbursements
3.09    The proceeds of the proposed loan would be disbursed against:
(a) lOOZ of the CIF cost of imported goods; and (b) 100Z of the ex-factory
cost of locally manufactured goods. A schedule of disbursements is given in
Annex 3.4. It shows disbursements being completed in five and one half
years, the same time as disbursements for the Third project are expected to
take, and about one and one half years less than the Bank-wide average for
transmission and distribution projects. Since the Project covers a four-year
time-slice of WAPDA's STG program, and implementation is scheduled to be
completed at the end of four years, the five and one half years allowed for
disbursements should be adequate, allowing for some slippage.
Ecology
3.10    No ecological problems are expected.
Risks
3.11    The Project consists of normal electric utility work entailing no
unusual risks, and no particular difficulty is foreseen in its execution.
Project cost estimates are based on similar work currently in progress in
the country, and provision has been made for escalation, so there should be
little risk of substantial cost overruns.

IV. FINANCES
Overview
4.01    The analysis and projections covered in this chapter are only con-
cerned with the financial performance of WAPDA's power wing which, for ease
of reference, is henceforth referred to as WAPDA. In setting electricity
tariffs, the Authority is guided by the WAPDA Act which stipulates that:
"The rates at which the Authority shall sell power shall be so fixed as to
provide for meeting the operating costs, interest charges and depreciation
of assets, the redemption at due time of loans other than those covered by
depreciation, the payment of any taxes and a reasonable return on invest-
ment." The Act, however, does not specify what constitutes a reasonable
return on investment. Under an earlier lending operation, the Bank set a
rate of return of 8% on revalued assets as a target for measuring WAPDA's
financial performance. However, compliance with the rate of return covenant
was not possible because of delays in the implementation of the procedures
for revaluing assets. As a result, the rate of return covenant was replaced
by a cash generation covenant, which requires WAPDA to finance not less than
40Z of its capital expenditures from internal sources.  According to this
covenant, the level of internal cash generation is determined by averaging
the capital investment over a period of three years, covering the current and
preceding two years.  Although WAPDA has been able to satisfy the covenant,
the formula used for calculating the level of cash generation is retrospec-
tive, rather than prospective. The covenant, as outlined in the existing
loan agreements, forces the authority to take corrective action for short-
falls only after they have occurred. WAPDA has been able to meet the 40Z
internal cash generation with minimal tariff increases because the actual
investment has been as low as 50% of the planned investment, which has been a
major factor in the power shortages and high system losses. The divergence
between planned and actual investment is attributable to the control of the
Ministry of Finance over the annual budgetary allocation to WAPDA's develop-
ment program.
4.02    These shortcomings are being addressed by redefining the cash gener-
ation covenant to reflect the prospective aspect of the capital investment
program along the line of recently issued Bank guidelines, and by agreeing on
a three-year core investment program (para 1.12). During negotiations, GOP
and WAPDA agreed to: (i) change the basis for the calculation of the level
of internal cash generation starting FY89 by adopting the rule requiring the
averaging of the year under consideration, the preceding year and the
forthcoming year, and take into account increases/decreases in working capi-
tal. GOP and WAPDA also agreed to set tariffs to ensure that, as a minimum,
WAPDA would finance 40X of capital investment from internal cash generation
(para 6.01). In meeting the financial performance covenant, WAPDA will begin
closing the gap between tariffs and LRMC (para 1.12). Based on forecasts
through FY91, WAPDA will need to increase its average revenue during this
period at an average annual rate of about 16%. Assuming inflation at an
average annual rate of 6%, the average annual increase in tariffs in real
terms would amount to about 10%. The financial forecast is based on this
assumption.



-20-
Past Performance
4.03    During the last five years (FY80-FY84), WAPDA has been able to
finance between 53Z and 76% of its capital investments from internal sources.
These self-financing ratios are higher than would normally be expected due to
the execution of a smaller than planned construction program (para 4.01).
However, tariff increases, reductions in system losses, and a fuel adjustment
surcharge, which allov- WAPDA to recover part of the cost of fuel from its
consumers, have contrii,uted to achieving the level of internal cash gener-
ation. Also, the recently adopted accounting and commercial systems are
enabling management to begin exerting a tighter control over operations. The
rate of return on historically valued average net fixed assets in service
during this five-year period was between 15Z and 18% and between 8% and 10%
on revalued assets.l/ Balance sheets, income statements and sources and
application of funds statements for FY80-FY84 are presented in Annexes 4.1,
4.2 and 4.3, respectively. These are summarized below:

Present Financial Position
4.04    The book value of fixed assets is shown at historical cost, as
required by GOP. A large proportion of WAPDA's electricity supply
facilities, including generating plants, and the transmission and distribu-
tion networks, were commissioned during the last few years. As a result,
WAPDA's gross fixed assets in service have increased by 93% during the last
five years, FY8O-FY84. Of all the electricity supply facilities that came on
stream during this period, about 60% were financed from WAPDA's internal
sources, and 40Z from borrowings. WAPDA is currently in the process of
establishing a fixed asset accounting system, which will cLassify fixed

assets by category and form the basis for the formulation of appropriate
depreciation schedules. This work would be completed by December 1985.
Until such time, an average rate of depreciation of about 3.5X is being
appLied, which is considered adequate by the Bank. WAPDA's capitaLization as
of June 30, 1984 is summarized below:

Total Capital                  33,259          2,294           100
The figures show a debt/equity ratio of 48/52 in FY84, compared to a ratio of
61/39 for FY79, reflecting the increased reliance of WAPDA on its internal
resources for financing its investment program which has improved its
capitalization position. The debt/equity ratio is calculated on the basis of
assets valued at historical cost, and since the assets are thus undervalued,
the equity is understated. If the assets were adjusted on the basis of
proforma revaluation, the debt/equity ratio would be about 30/70. Both the
ratio of current assets to current liabiLities and the coverage of debt
service from internally generated cash are satisfactory.
Investment Program

Financing Plan
4.06    Based on the above development program, a forecast of the sources
and applications of funds for the next seven years (FY85-FY91) is shown in
Annex 4.3. The financing plan reflects a PRs 30 billion core investment
program during the three-year period FY86-88, which has been agreed with GOP
(para 1.12). It also reflects tariff increases to enable WAPDA to
self-finance a minimum of 40X of its capital investment program (para 1.12).

1/ Disbursements under the Project of US$10 million would be made after
FY89.
During this period, the funds required for the development program (gener-
ation, transmission and distribution) would amount to PBs 45,134 million
(US$3,113 million), consisting of PRs 43,250 million (US$2,983 million) for
capital investment and PRs 1,884 million (US$130 million) for increase in
working capital. Of the total, PRs 29,154 million (US$2,011 million) would
be in the form of loans, of which PRs 12,050 million are local funds to be
lent by GOP, which form part of WAPDA's Government-approved capital program.
Of the remaining PRs 17,104 million (US$1,180 million equivalent) in foreign
exchange, US$1,000 million has already been arranged, or is in the process of
being arranged, leaving US$180 million still to be obtained. However, the
financing gap covers, to a large extent, projects that would be initiated
during the latter part of the Sixth Five-Year Plan and executed during the
Seventh Five-Year Plan. The uncertainty concerning the source of financing
for these projects is not serious and it is not likely to adversely affect



-23-
the development plan. It is expected that the financing gap would be bridged
in time to allow for the timely execution of WAPDA's development plan.
Future Finances
4.07    Forecast balance sheets, income statements and sources and applica-
tions of funds statements for FY85-91 are shown in Annexes 4.1, 4.2 and 4.3.
A suimmary of forecast operating results for the seven-year period is shown
below. Revenue projections are based on increases in generation of elec-
tricity, tariff increases and a reduction of system losses. The forecast of
operating expenses is based on system expansion and planned thermal gener-
ation. Depreciation is taken at a 3.5% composite rate. The seven-year
forecast shows operating revenues and expenses increasing at an average
annual rate of about 26% and takes into account annual inflation of about 6%.
During this period, electricity generation is forecast to increase by 73%
and electricity sold by 88%, reflecting a decrease in system losses. This
forecast shows that WAPDA would continue to self-finance not less than 40% of
its capital investment program and -hereby meet the financial performance
covenant. The forecast assumes that che present covenant would remain in
effect through FY88 and that the new i.orward looking covenant would become
operative starting FY89 (para 4.02). The rate of return on revalued assets
during the forecast period would range between 6% and 9Z.

4.08    Forecast balance sheets (Annex 4.1) show WAPDA's financial position
during the forecast seven-year period under consideration. A substantial
growth is expected in gross fixed assets, from PRs 29,333 million in FY84
to PRs 103,912 million at the end of FY91. Over the same period, equity is
expected to increase almost threefold, from PRs 17,307 million in FY84 to



-24-
PRs 46,164 million in FY91, with retained earnings accounting for 80Z of this
increase. Long-term debt is forecast to increase fourfold, from PRs 15,952
million to PRs 65,604 million, resulting in a debt/equity ratio in FY91 of
59/41, which is reasonable for an electric utility. The coverage of debt
service by internal cash generation would be satisfactory during this period
as would be the ratio of current assets to current liabilities. Neverthe-
less, the debt servicing position of WAPDA should be monitored. During nego-
tiations, agreement was reached regarding a limitation on WAPDA incurring
debt, based on the Bar's forecast cash flow debt limitation covenant, with
debt service coverage dt 1.5 times (para 6.02).
Financial/Commercial Operations
4.09    WAPDA has made good progress in streamlining its commercial opera-
tions and in establishing modern accounting and commercial systems with the
assistance of consultants (Peat, Marwick, Mitchell and Co.). WAPDA's
managers are becoming more aware of the value of financial control in helping
to monitor and measure the operations and performance of the Authority.
Nevertheless, additional work still needs to be undertaken in areas such as
materials management, asset valuation and accounting. Also, extensive train-
ing programs are needed to ensure that the new systems are properly staffed.
This additional work requires substantial outside assistance, which will be
furnished by USAID under its recently approved rural electrification project
(paras 2.09 and 2.10). The project is timely in that, inter alia, it will
continue with and build on the work carried out by WAPDA with the assistance
of Peat, Marwick, Mitchell and Co. Recognizing the Bank Group's interest in
strengthening the Power Sector, it has been mutually agreed between WAPDA,
USAID and the Bank that close coordination will be maintained.
4.10    A limiting factor in continuing the strengthening of WAPDA is the
shortage of qualified staff in the accounting and commercial departments.
Although the new commercial procedures have been implemented, the desired
results are not always being achieved, mainly because of the inadequacy of
key staff. Unless qualified staff is maintained in key posts, the momentum
generated will lag and further progress will be slow. WAPDA has been
experienci-g difficulties in filling the more senior financial/commercial
positions because of the inexperience of the present staff in financial and
commercial management procedures and the overall shortage of experienced
Pakistanis in the market precipitated by the attractive compensation packages
offered in the Gulf States. WAPDA, with assistance of USAID, will be
evaluating its recruitment practices, job grading and compensations for the
financial staff. This would facilitate the recruitment of experienced finan-
cial staff from outside the Authority. To monitor the improvement in WAPDA's
accounting capabilities, it was agreed during negotiations that WAPDA shall:
(a) from time to time review with the Bank the qualifications and adequacy
in number of the accountants in its power wing; and (b) thereafter establish,
as necessary, a plan satisfactory to the Bank for recruitment of profession-
ally qualified accountants (para 6.02). Provision has been made under the
Project for 32 accountants to receive training abroad.
4.11    The commercial function in WAPDA is of major importance, and becomes
increasingly so as a large number of new consumers is added each year. The
commercial operations include application processing, connection of service,
meter reading, billing and collection, disconnection and reconnection, and



-25-
customer relations, each of which directly affects WAPDA's realization of
revenue. In upgrading its financial and commercial functions, the post of
general manager was created for the finance department, and the post of chief
commercial manager created for the commercial department, but with the latter
lacking sufficient powers to operate effectively. This continues to hinder
the commercial functions of the Authority. In order to strengthen its com-
mercial department vis-a-vis other departments, the granting to the chief
commercial manager the powers of a general manager in all commercial matters
is a condition of loan effectiveness (para 6.04).
Internal Audit
4.12    WAPDA's Internal Audit Department is large.  Its functions should be
examined and revised with the objective of enhancing its role and influence
within the Authority. Compliance auditing clearly should be a major function
of the department, and a more positive role should be established embracing
the wider aspects of management audit. In order to develop a suitable inter-
nal audit function, WAPDA should engage outside assistance estimated at 20
man-months to help with the re-orientation of the department's activities and
with training of staff. During negotiations, agreement was reached that WAPDA
shall engage consultants, by not later than September 30, 1985, whose
qualifications, experience and terms of reference shall be satisfactory to
the Bank, for the purpose of developing a modern system for internal auditing
(para 6.02).
External Audit
4.13    The WAPDA Act stipulates that the Auditor General (AG) of Pakistan be
responsible for auditing WAPDA's accounts. He discharges his responsibility
through one of his special groups, headed by the Director, WAPDA Audit, and
employing some 400 staff. It is attached to WAPDA on a permanent basis and
its employees are located at all points of its operations. Under Credit
968-PAK, it was agreed to accept AG as the independent auditor until the
WAPDA accounting system was strengthened sufficiently to permit a judgment as
to the quality of the Government audit. It is still too early to render a
judgment. AG is making a significant effort to strengthen the audit func-
tion. Under Dutch assistance, AG's staff is being strengthened through
training programs under the direction of four expatriate specialists in
auditing. These specialists are stationed in Lahore and have trained some
100 audit officers in the techniques of auditing. They are to remain in
Lahore through 1985 to continue the training program and to develop a cadre
to train staff on a continuing basis after the experts depart. Another
positive step is that performance auditing is gradually being introduced.
These improvements together with WAPDA's efforts to reform its accounting
procedures and strengthen its internal audit functions, will go a long way in
faciLitating AG in performing a satisfactory audit.
4.14    Under Credit 968-PAK, the Bank Group has reserved the right to
monitor the present audit arrangements and, if necessary, to ask that an
additional independent auditor be appointed. Present arrangements are that
the Preliminary Audit Observations, together with the balance sheet, income
statement and any other relevant statements covering the performance of
WAPDA, are accepted for the time being as satisfying the Bank's audit
requirements. The observations are normally issued within six months of the



-26-
close of the fiscal year. Considering the present circumstances, it is
recommended that the existing audit arrangements continue until the new
internal audit system is in place (para 4.12) and the new accounting system
is fully implemented and operational, so that a judgment may be made on the
quality of the Government audit. The new internal auditing system is
unlikely to be implemented prior to December 31, 1986, after which audits
consistent with Bank guidelines would be required on an annual basis within
six months of the end of each fiscal year. During negotiations, it was
agreed that the Bank's standard audit covenant would be included in the loan
documents to enable the Bank to retain the right of exercising the option of
requesting an audit consistent with its guidelines, and that the interim
arrangement governing WAPDA audits would be outlined in the minutes of nego-
tiations (para 6.02).
Government Arrears
4.15    Private consumers have been settling their electricity bills satis-
factorily, while Government needs to improve on the time it takes in settling
its accounts. Though there has been considerable improvement, with arrears
declining from about seven months' Government billings to four months, the
position is still not satisfactory. Government should now be settling its
electricity accounts in not more than three months from receipt of bill.
During negotiations, GOP agreed to settle all arrears owing to WAPDA as of
June 30, 1985 by not later than December 31, 1985 and that all future elec-
tricity bills shall be paid by all government agencies and departments within
three months after the receipt of the bill (para 6.03). It would be expected
that, if necessary, the Federal and Provincial Governments would make ade-
quate provision in the budgets of their agencies and departments for the
payment of current bills.
Insurance
4.16    Prior to 1977, WAPDA had been insuring with the National Insurance
Corporation of Pakistan, a Government insurance agency under the Ministry
of Commerce. After experiencing difficulty in settling its claims with NIC,
it elected to insure its assets under a self-insurance scheme. With the
assistance of actuarial consultants, WAPDA established a self-insurance
scheme covering substations, power houses, machinery and workshops against
loss from fire and machinery breakdown. The scheme is administered by a
Board of Management consisting of six members, with the Member Finance as
Chairman. The other five members are: Member Power; General Manager, Finance
(Power); Manager, Finance Coordination; WAPDA's Internal Auditor and the
Director of Insurance. The Board meets periodically together with the
actuarial consultant co review the insurance program. At present, PRsl4.4
million is allocated annually to the insurance fund, an amount determined
based on studies carried out by WAPDA and its actuarial consultants. The
insurance fund, amounting to PRs 64.7 million (as of June 30, 1984), is
administered separately by the Board of Management and is invested in Defense
Savings Bonds (approved by the Government), earning annual interest of 10%.
These insurance arrangements are satisfactory.

V. ECONOMIC JUSTIFICATION
A. Forecast of Electricity Sales by WAPDA
5.01    The rates of growth of electricity sales by WAPDA between 1973 and
1983 are presented in Table 5.1 below. Over the ten-year period, sales
increased at an average annual rate of 9.7%; however, the rate of growth was
substantially higher in the second than in the first-half of the decade,
averaging about 7.1% for the period 1973-1978, compared to 12.3% for
1978-1983. The most significant change was in the industrial sector, where
the rate of growth of electricity sales more than tripled over the two
periods, increasing from 3.1% to 11.2%. The growth of sales to the household
and commercial sectors also increased substantially over the two periods,
increasing from 17.2% to 23.3Z for households and from 13.9% to 15.7% for the
commercial sector. The dcceleration in the growth of electricity sales was
primarily due to (a) the increased demand for electricity by the industrial
sector whose real output rose at an average annual rate of 6.9% for the
period .978-1983, compared to 4.5Z for 1973-1978; (b) the flow of resources
in the form of workers' remittances from the Gulf area, which maintained a
buoyant demand for electricity by the household and commercial consumers;
(c) the increased emphasis by GOP in extending public supply of electricity
to low-income consumers in both the rural and urban areas; and (d) the main-
tenance by GOP of increases in electricity tariffs below the rate of increase
in the general price level, which resulted in a sustained decline in the real
tariff for electricity between 1978 and 1983.

5.02    Electricity sales are forecast to increase between 1983 and 1993 at
an average annual rate of about 9.3% which is only slightly lower than the
rate of growth of 9.7% observed for the period 1973-1983. However, as shown

the forecast rates of growth of 10.4Z and 8.3% for the periods 1983-1988 and
1989-1993 are substantially lower than the 12.3% observed for the period
1978-1983. The deceleration in the rate of growth of electricity sales
between 1983 and 1988 is primarily due to supply constraints precipitated by
the shortage of financial resources which have induced GOP to substantially
scale down the Sixth Five-Year Plan's investment program for the power sub-
sector. However, over the next five years, it is also expected to result
from: (a) the increase in real tariffs to achieve parity with LRMC by 1989
which would double the average tariff in real terms, and consequently induce
a greater emphasis on conservation and a more rational use of power by con-
sumers; and (b) the initiation by GOP of a program for energy conservation,
concentrating initially on the large energy intensive industries such as
cement, steel, fertilizers, building materials, etc. As a result, the growth
rates of sales to all consumer categories are forecast to drop from about
10.4% for the period 1983-1988 to about 8.3% for the period 1989-1993.
B. Least Cost Alternative
5.03    The Project has been prepared by WAPDA, whose capabilities in for-
mulating and implementing programs for the extension and reinforcement of
its transmission network have been developed through the involvement of the
World Bank Group and ADB. Each component of the Project is evaluated by
WAPDA to determine the optimum design and capacity that would contribute to
the delivery of power at least cost to the economy in terms of technical
losses, and capital and operating costs. The Bank reviewed the methodology
used and the results produced and found them satisfactory.
C. Internal Economic Rate of Return
5.04    Although the proposed Project is expected to play a critical role in
ensuring the optimal development and operation of the power system, its
benefit cannot be isolated from those of generation and distribution. Conse-
quently, the return on WAPDA's investment program, covering generation,
transmission and distribution, for the period 1984-1990 is used as a proxy
for the return on the Project. The internal economic rate of return (IERR)
is about 6.2%, based on the measurable costs and benefits (Annex 5.1). The
measurable costs include: (a) capital and labor costs involved in develop-
ment of generation, transmission and distribution facilities; (b) the annual
cost of operation and maintenance, assumed at about 3% of the capital cost;
and (c) the incremental cost of fuels comprising natural gas, fuel oil and



-29-
coal, valued at their cost to the economy. Domestic costs of capital and
labor, both skilled and unskilled, were expressed in their equivalent border
values. The measurable benefits are only comprised of the incremental
revenues associated with the investment program, based on an average revenue
of 63 paisa/kWh, which is taken as a proxy for the consumers' willingness to
pay. The revenues were also expressed in terms of their equivalent border
values. Details of the assumptions used and the calculations for shadow
pricing are presented in Annex 5.2.
5.05    The return on the Project does not compare favorably with the oppor-
tunity cost of capital of about 11%; however, this is not a measure of its
economic merit, but a reflection of the deviation of WAPDA's average tariff
from the LRMC of supply (para 1.13). COP maintains WAPDA's tariffs low for
social reasons. This aLlows WAPDA's consumers to capture surplus or benefit
greater than is reflected in its tariffs. If these tariffs are used as a
proxy for the benefits attributed to the Project, IERR understates the real
return. A better estimate of the Project's economic viability could be
obtained only if the surplus currently captured by WAPDA's consumers is
quantified. Ideally, this could be estimated once the demand curve is
specified. However, specification of the demand curve cannot be accurately
determined because of the inadequacy of available data. A partial measure of
the surplus can be estimated by determining the maximum price consumers are
willing to pay for electricity. Consumers supplied by KESC pay an average
tariff for electricity which is about 56% higher than WAPDA's average tariff,
98 paisa/kWh compared with 63 paisa/kWh.  KESC's average tariff is a better
measure of what consumers in Pakistan are willing to pay at present for
public supply of electricity. If KESC's average tariff of 98 paisa/kWh is
used as a proxy for WAPDA's consumers' willingness to pay, and incremental
sales are reduced by 5% to allow for the possibility that not all consumers
would be willing to pay the higher tariffs, the Project's IERR would increase
to about 13.1%, which is a more accurate approximation of the real return on
the Project.
5.06    If WAPDA's average tariff is increased, in real terms, by about 12%
annually between FY86 and FY90 in order to meet 40X of its development
program of Rs 30 billion agreed with the Bank for FY86-FY88, and the
incremental sales are reduced by about 3%1J per year to accommodate the
likelihood that higher real tariffs would induce greater conservation and
economy in the use of electricity, the rate of return on the Project
increases to about 14%. The 14% IERR represents the minimum return on the
proposed Project. If all the benefits associated with the Project could be
quantified, the IERR would be higher.  These benefits include the improvement
in the power plant efficiency expected after the completion of the Project;
the reduction in the overall fuel cost associated with the commissioning of
the dispatch center which would ensure the efficient operation of existing
and new power plants; and the reduction in the losses in transmission and
1/ Sales are reduced by 3%, instead of 5% when KESC's tariffs were used, to
allow for the fact that the changes in tariffs to meet the 40% cash gener-
ation covenant would be implemented over a longer price horizon. This makes
it more relevant to appLy long-term time elasticities which have been shown
to be lower than the short-term elasticities.

VI. SUMMARY OF AGREEMENTS
6.01    During negotiations, GOP and WAPDA agreed to:
(a)  review with the Bank the result of the hydro ranking study by not
later than June 30, 1985 and identify the priority schemes, their
sequencing and the timetable for their preparation and development
(para 1.02); and
(b)  change the basis for the calculation of the level of internal cash
generation (40%) starting FY89 by adopting the rule requiring the
averaging of the year under consideration, the preceding year and
the forthcoming year, and take into account increases/decreases in
working capital (para 4.02).
6.02    During negotiations, WAPDA agreed to:
(a)  initiate a study by June 30, 1985, under terms of reference
acceptable to the Bank, to formulate a national least-cost plan for
the power subsector and to complete the study and review its
results with the Bank by June 30, 1986 (para 2.05);
(b)  engage consultants with terms of reference satisfactory to the Bank
by July 31, 1985, and to complete with their assistance by
July 31, 1986 a study aimed at identifying the sources of energy
losses in its transmission system, quantifying such losses,
determining the optimum levels of such losses, and producing
detailed work and investment programs, as necessary, to achieve such
optimum levels (para 2.06);
(c)  engage consultants with terms of reference acceptable to the Bank
by Jure 30, 1985 and prepare with their assistance by June 30,
1986 programs of work and investment to optimize the thermal
efficiency of WAPDA's existing thermal power stations (para 2.06);
(d)  take all necessary measures aimed at reducing its system losses to
21% by 1988 and to review and revise the targets, as necessary, once
the results of the loss reduction study become available (para
2.06);
(e)  the Bank's debt limitation covenant, based on forecast cash flow
with debt service coverage at 1.5 times (para 4.08);
(f)  review with the Bank the qualifications and adequacy of the number
of accountants in its power wing, and establish, as necessary,
a plan satisfactory to the Bank for recruiting professionally
qualified accountants (para 4.10);



-31-
(g) engage consultants, by not later than September 30, 1985, whose
qualifications, experience and terms of reference shall be

FOURTH WAPDA POWER PROJECT
Notes and Assumptions for Financial Forecasts
INCOME STATEMENT
Sale of Electricity
The forecast sale of electricity is based on projected plant
expansion and takes into account a reduction in system losses. Increase
in sales is forecast at an average annual rate of about 10X through FY91.
Average Revenue per kWh Sold
The average revenue per kWh sold reflects changes in the fuel
adjustment surcharge, as well as tariff increases of 11% in FY86, plus
another 107% in increases spread over the period FY87-91.
Other Operating Revenue
Other operating revenue consists principally of miscellaneous
services such as transfer/replacement of meters, application fees, recon-
nection of service, etc. These revenues are shown to increase by 10% per
year based on the increase in the number of consumers.
Fuel Cost
Increase in fuel costs have been assumed as follows:
(a) 40% per annum for raw gas and 30% for purified gas up to FY88,
and 10% thereafter;
(b) HSD, fuel oil and crude oil at 10% per annum; and
(c) Coal at 5Z annually.
Maintenance Expense
Maintenance expense is related to plant in service and is forecast
at 2.2% of fixed assets in operation for FY85 and 2.4Z for the following
years, taking into account past experience and the increasing proportion
of thermal plant in the system.

Annex 4.4
Page 2 of 3
Operation and Administration Expense
Except for FY88, operation and administration expense is forecast
to increase by 25% annually, taking into account system expension, infLa-
tion and also past experience. An increase of 35% is taken for FY88 to
reflect an expected general wage increase.
Depreciation
WAPDA is applying a composite rate of depreciation of 3.5Z.  This
rate is realistic and has been used in the forecasts.
Other Income
Other income includes interest, sale of scrap and rental of office
space, and is shown to increase by 10% annually.
Payment to Government
WAPDA has been remitting Rs 20 million annually to Government for
assets earlier transferred to WAPDA. Forecasts show this payment continu-
ing.
BALANCE SHEET
Cash
Cash balances are projected on the basis of about six weeks' cash
operating expense.
Inventories
Inventories are forecast on the basis of a percentage of fixed
assets in operation. Taking into account past experience and WAPDA's
efforts to improve materials management, the following percentages are
used for the forecasts:
62   of fixed assets in FY85 and 86
5.5% of fixed assets in FY87
5%   of fixed assets thereafter
Accounts Receivables
Forecasts assume that, as in the past, WAPDA's accounts receiv-
ables will be equivalent to two months' billings.

Page 3 of 3
Other Current Assets
Other current assets include miscellaneous receivables, advances
and clearing accounts. Forecasts assume a 5% annual increase.
Current Liabilities
Current liabiLities include consumer security deposits, deposits
for works to be carried out for other agencies, contractor deposits,
duties payable and accrued salaries. Based on past experience, current
liabilities are forecast at between 50Z and 60% of current assets.

II. BENEFITS
Revenues were calculated based on the projected incremental sales valued
using the average revenue of 0.63 rupees (1984 prices), which is assumed as a
proxy for the consumers' willingness to pay. Revenues were converted to their
equivalent border prices using the standard conversion factor of 0.9.
In the case of sensitivity, KESC's average revenue of 0.98 rupees (in
1984 prices) was taken as a proxy for consumers' willingness to pay. Revenues
were revalued in terms of border price using the standard conversion factor of
0.9.
