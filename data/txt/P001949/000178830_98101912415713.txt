REPUBLIC OF NIGER
STAFF APPRAISAL REPORT
FEEDER ROADS PROJECT
I. THE TRANSPORT SECTOR
A. Geographie and Economic Setting
1.01      The Republic of Niger is a landlocked country of about 1.27 million
km2 bordered on the north by Algeria, the south by Benin and Nigeria, the
east by Chad and the west by Upper Volta and Mali. The population is esti-
mated at 4.8 million with a growth rate of about 3% per annum. About 90% of
the population lives in rural areas, and approximately 80% of them live in a
200 km wide zone along the southern border; north of this area the country
becomes sub-saharan and saharan with infrequent and unreliable rainfall.
Apart from the Air Mountains in the north and small areas of broken terrain
in other regions, the topography is generally flat to rolling. The main
engineering difficulty in road improvement and maintenance is the frequently
poor quality and shortage of road making materials -- relatively little
laterite, large areas of non-cohesive sands and limited availability of water
-- which can lead to higher construction costs than in neighboring countries.
1.02      Estimated per capita gross clomestic product (GDP) at market prices
in 1975 was US$130 (equivalent). Between 1970 and 1975 (a period of severe
drought) there was real decrease in GDP of 2.8% p.a. It is, however, diffi-
cult to estimate a reliable trend in GDP owing to the large annual variations
in rainfall and their effect on agriculture and livestock activities, and
recent production and price increases in the uranium mining operation at
Arlit. The economy remains based on agriculture (30% of GDP) and livestock
(12% of GDP). Uranium mining is steaclily increasing in importance. Although
it contributes only about 4% of GDP, uranium concentrates account for more
than 60% of the value of exports, and the mining operations contribute about
16% of Government revenue. 1/  While uranium mining will continue to be an
important growth industry, the country's long-term development and the welfare
of most of its people will continue tco depend on the agriculture and livestock
sectors, perhaps supplemented by agro-industries. The Government is, there-
fore, directing its development policies toward these sectors.
B. The Agricultural Sector
1.03      Niger has two major farming zones which are located within a belt
about 200 km wide running east and west across the southern part of the
country.
1/   Since the most recent national accounts are for 1969, estimates are used.



(a) The valley of the River Niger: This zone depends primarily
on rainfed agriculture and the seasonal flooding of low-
lying areas. There are also about 3,000 ha of irrigated
land, which may be expanded by 150,000 ha if a pro-
posed dam is built at Kandadji. The main crops are rice,
fruit and vegetables.
(b) The rainfed areas: These cover approximately 10% of the
country; the main crops are millet and sorghum for domestic
consumption and groundnuts and cowpeas for export. Cotton
and onions are of considerable importance in some areas.
The following table shows the production of main crops from 1970 to 1976;
the effects of drought can be clearly seen.

1.04      Before 1973, Niger was self-sufficient in food grains in years of
normal rainfall. Recent experience and Bank projections indicate that un-
reliable rainfall and high population growth will lead to significant overall
shortages of food grains in the foreseeable future. Yet, even with a national
shortage, there are regions with considerable surpluses. Given adequate col-
lection and distribution services, including storage, vehicles and improved
road access, much could be done to alleviate shortages elsewhere in the
country.

1.05      The Ministry of Rural Development's (MRD) four directorates--
Agriculture, Livestock, Rural Engineering (Genie Rural), and Water and
Forests--plan rural development and implement development projects. At
the farm level the Union Nigerienne de Credit et Cooperation (UNCC), is
responsible for agricultural marketing, input supply, agricultural cooperative
development, and management of certain development projects. Private traders/
transporters also play an important part in the supply of farm inputs. Three
parastatal agencies control the final marketing and processing of certain
crops:  (a) Societe Nigerienne de Commiercialisation de l'Arachide (SONARA) for
cowpeas and groundnuts; (b) Office des Produits Vivriers du Niger (OPVN) for
cereals; and (c) Compagnie Francaise pour le Developpement des Fibres Textiles
(CFDT) for cotton.
1.06      Government strategy in the agricultural sector is, first, to intro-
duce measures to maximize both crop and livestock production in rainfed
regions and, secondly, to increase the area under controlled irrigation. The
major constraints on development of the agricultural sector are: (a) fre-
quently poor and unreliable rainfall, (b) impoverishment of soils often due to
over-cropping and poor husbandry, (c) inadequate inputs and extension services,
and (d) difficult access. To overcome the problem of poor rainfall, the Gov-
ernment plans to increase the area uncler irrigation. Projects are being
developed with external assistance (including Bank Group) to overcome the
other constraints. In the majority of- the development areas (rainfed and
irrigated) transport improvements are identified as essential. Proposed
investment in ongoing or planned agricultural projects (excluding livestock)
during the five-year period 1978 to 1982 represents an average investment of
about US$47 million p.a. Even allowing for the greater emphasis placed on
agriculture, this level of investment seems optimistic in view of Niger's past
record and absorptive capacity.  The most recent available figures (1970-75)
show average annual agricultural investment in 1978 prices of about US$25
million.
1.07      The main agricultural development projects either underway or pro-
posed are the following:
Maradi Integrated Rural Development Project (Cr. 608-NIR). This IDA-financed
project was started in 1976 with an estimated cost of US$12.0 million of which an
IDA credit provided US$10.7 million. Benefits will be derived from increases
in the production of crops in rainfed areas, increases in irrigated agricul-
ture, and livestock development. The project area has a population of about
325,000 inhabitants. The project includes the construction and improvement of
80 km of feeder roads which are being undertaken by contract. 1/
Zinder Integrated Rural Development Project (3 M's). This is a European Devel-
opment Fund (EDF) financed project in the three regions of Matemeye, Magaria
and Mirriah in Zinder Department. The project started its 15-year second
1/   The cost is high--CFAF 4.0 million per km.



- 4 -
phase in 1977 with estimated costs of CFAF 1.95 billion (US$8.5 million
equivalent). The benefits will be derived from (a) increasing yields from
rainfed farming of millet, cowpeas and groundnuts; (b) the improvement of
swamp lands for agriculture; and (c) development of poultry and livestork.
Feeder road needs were identified during project preparation at about 230 km.
The population of the project area is estimated at 710,000 inhabitants.
Niamey Development Project. USAID is assisting in financing this project
which is located in the regions of Filingue, Ouallam and Niamey. The first
phase of the project began in 1977 with a large study element based on pilot
operations. Eventually the four-year project will be extended to about 90
villages grouped into cooperatives with demonstration farming practices,
agricultural extension services and the training of young farmers plus the
provision of necessary inputs; millet, sorghum and cowpeas are the main crops.
The ongoing pilot project will provide more reliable information on the
project content and economic justification.
Dosso Development Project. This project will enter its second phase in 1979.
The first phase was financed by Fonds d'Aide et Cooperation (FAC) and USAID.
The Bank is participating in the preparation of the second phase and is
expected to cofinance it. Benefits will be derived from (a) increased yields
of millet, sorghum, cowpeas, groundnuts and cotton; (b) the development of the
crops in bottom lands; and (c) improving livestock. Project preparation is
expected to be completed before the end of 1978. Approximately 415 kms of
feeder roads have been identified as requiring improvement.
Say Productivity Project. The region of Say possesses some of the few areas
of useful non-exploited agricultural land in Niger. The objective of a pro-
posed project to start in 1981 is to exploit this land by encouraging immigra-
tion. Only very preliminary studies have so far been carried out and these
indicate an initial investment of about 4.5 million CFAF. Financing for this
project has not yet been obtained.
Tahoua Productivity Project. The second stage of this project is being pre-
pared and financing has yet to be arranged. The ongoing first stage is
receiving EDF support. Benefits would be derived from (a) increases in cereal
and cowpea production; (b) increases in cotton production; and (c) development
of the important onion growing areas. This is essentially a dry-land farming
project. The project's first stage includes about 190 km of feeder road
improvements executed by a project unit; work has just commenced on these
roads. No provision or arrangements have been made for the subsequent main-
tenance of the feeder roads.
C. The Transport System
1.08      Niger's transport system consists of 18,400 km of roads and tracks,
an international airport at Niamey and five domestic airports, and to a limited
extent the river Niger. Niger also has an important interest in the Benin



- 5 -
railway operated by the Organisation Commune Benin-Niger des Chemins de Fer et
des Transports (OCBN) which is one of its main outlets to the sea. The extent
and density of the road system are generally adequate except for certain
agricultural development areas where new feeder roads are needed. Past and
present road programs have concentrated on the improvement of the main and
secondary roads; feeder roads and tracks are generally of a low standard and
require improvement and maintenance.
Highways
1.09      Details of the highway sector are discussed in Chapter II.
Air Transport
1.10      The size of Niger and the location of the capital in the south-
western part of the country make domestic air transport important. Although
the quality of land transport is improving, air services will remain important
especially for passenger transport and emergency operations. Air Niger, the
national airline, serves the five domestic airports using DC 3's, DC 4's and
a recently acquired F 27 turboprop. A Boeing 737-200 aircraft was recently
delivered and may be used for internal services when necessary airport improve-
ments are carried out. However, efficient use of this aircraft may depend on
a restructuring of tariffs in order to increase traffic. The Agence Inter-
nationale pour la Securite de la Navigation Aerienne (ASECNA) operates the
international airport at Niamey which was improved with the assistance of the
Association (Cr. 473-NIR, 1974) and now is capable of handling 747 aircraft.
Passenger traffic at Niamey in 1977 was nearly 76,000 while freight traffic
amounted to nearly 9,000 tons.
OCBN and Other External Transport Routes
1.11      OCBN, jointly administered by the governments of Niger and Benin,
controls traffic on the Benin route, which is the major import/export route
for Niger.  Traffic on this route travels by rail between the port of Cotonou
(Benin) and Parakou and by road between Parakou and Niamey. Other routes are
(a) the Togolese railway and road route passing through Togo and Upper Volta;
(b) the Regie Abidjan - Niger railway from Abidjan to Ouagadougou (Upper
Volta) and thence by road to Niger; and (c) Nigerian Railways to Kano and
thence by road to Niger which is used particularly for fuel imports.
D.   Transport Services in Agricultural Areas.
1.12      There are four main groups of transporters active in the rural and agri-
cultural sectors:
(a) SONARA which carries cowpeas and groundnuts and serves
the more important regional markets (i.e., those markets
with a catchment area of about 30 km radius) using
trucks with 10- to 22-ton capacity;



- 6 -
(b)  OPVN which collects cereals from cooperative markets fre-
quently located in isolated regions. The vehicle fleet
consists of nearly 100 rigid and articulated trucks with
capacities between 6 and 40 tons;
(c)  private transporters/traders, operating with or without a
license, serve almost any market that is accessible, purchase
and transport agricultural produce, and supply agricultural
inputs, consumer goods and even credit. Their vehicles gen-
erally have a capacity of less than 5 tons but no statistics
are available; and
(d)  animal transport (especially by camel) which is very important
in some areas owing to difficult access and small consignments
(about 100 kilograms) and to socio-economic patterns.
While most areas in Niger are accessible by vehicle during the dry season,
vehicle operating costs on unimproved roads are very high.
E. Transport Sector Management and Investments
1.13      The Ministry of Public Works, Transport and Urbanism (MPWTU) is
responsible for planning and executing works related to the classified roads,
road traffic, airports and public buildings. Planning is coordinated through
the Ministry of Planning's (MP) Directorate of Programming and Planning. The
Transport Plan study 1/ (completed in July 1978) should make recommendations
for improved coordination between the two ministries.
1.14      MPWTU's Directorate of Public Works (DPW) and Directorate of Trans-
port (DT) are directly involved in the transport sector.
DPW improves, constructs, administers and maintains classi-
fied primary and secondary roads (and a few unclassified
feeder roads). It has (a) a Studies Department (which
includes a materials laboratory) responsible for contract
supervision; (b) a New Works Department, responsible for
the execution of road construction and maintenance through
regional divisions and sub-divisions; and (c) an Equipment
Division responsible for managing and maintaining the central
equipment pool.
DT controls and regulates the transport industry and
collects and analyses transport statistics.
Both Directorates have seriously tried to increase the number of Nigerien per-
sonnel at senior and middle management levels. This policy will continue, but
they will have to rely for some time on expatriate assistance.
1/   The Association has not yet obtained a copy of this study.

1.15      The Government's objectives; in the transport sector are based on the
premise that, in order to promote social and economic development, there is a
clear need to improve internal and external communications by:
(a)  improving and extending major road arteries such as
Zinder-Agadez, Zinder-Goure and Tahoua-Agadez-Arlit
together with transport services;
(b) improving secondary roads linking food deficit and surplus
areas to the main road system;
(c) constructing and improving feeder roads serving
agricultural development areas;
(d) making river traffic effective and studying the feasibility
of extending a railway line to Niger; and
(e) improving the main airports;.
This policy, yet to be defined preciskely, largely meets the needs of the
economy and is expected to continue dLuring the course of the economic and
social development plan (1979-83) which is being prepared. During the past
eight years, Niger has concentrated on improving its primary and secondary
road network. Relatively little effort has gone into feeder roads (estimated
at less than 1% of road investment). Feeder roads, nearly all unclassified,
are the responsibility of local authorities, who do not have adequate finan-
cial or physical resources for their improvement and maintenance. Investment
in feeder roads is expected to increase to at least 5% of total road in-
vestment during the next five years.
1.16      Between 1970 and 1977 (Table 1) investment in the transport sector
totalled over CFAF 38.7 billion (US$176 million equivalent) of which 90% was
allocated to the road sector. The current (1976-1978) three-year investment
program totals CFAF 88 billion (US$400 million) including an estimated CFAF
37.0 billion (US$168 million equivalent) for the transport sector. In addi-
tion about CFAF 25 billion (US$114 million) of private capital investment will
be undertaken by uranium mining companies on the Tahoua-Agadez-Arlit road
(646 km). In 1976 and 1977 total actual investment amounted to CFAF 16 bil-
lion (US$73 million) which, allowing for inflation, does not represent a real
increase over the yearly average for 1971-1975, but with the letting of the
Tahoua-Agadez-Arlit road contracts eaLrly in 1978 annual investment will
probably rise by about an additional CFAF 5 billion (US$23 million).
1.17      From 1972 to 1977 road maintenance expenditures  for classified roads
amounted to about CFAF 4.8 billion (US$23 million), which is one of the best
performances in terms of expenditure per kilometer in Western Africa. The



- 8 -
physical standard of routine maintenance for classified roads carried out by
the sub-divisions of DPW is also of an adequate standard although the periodic
maintenance of gravel roads requires additional effort, and this is being
addressed in the Third Highway Project.  Tn 1977, road maintenance expendi-
tures on primary and secondary roads are estimated to have been CFAF 1.6
billion (US$7 million), an increase of nearly 6% in real terms over 1976, and
represent about US$1,000/km.
E.   Bank Group Activities in the Transport Sector
1.18      The Association has played an important part in the transport sector.
Table 1 shows IDA's contributions to financing of transport development for
1970 through 1975 and for 1976 and 1977. There have been four IDA financed
projects in the highway sector in Niger:
First Highway Project (Cr. 55-NIR, US$1.5 million, 1964)
which comprised the engineering and construction of about
60 km of road mainly serving groundnut producing regions;
Highway Maintenance Project (Cr. 128-NIR, US$6.47 million,
1968) addressed Niger's highway maintenance needs and also
included pre-investment studies which led to the Second
Highway Project;
Second Highway Project (Cr. 231-NIR, US$6.55 million,
1971) provided for the construction of about 140 km of
road and the study of 170 km which were to form the
basis of the Third Highway Project; and
Third Highway Project (Cr. 612-NIR, US$15.6 million,
1976, plus another US$7.0 million and US$3.6 million
provided by BADEA and ADF) comprised a 4-year highway main-
tenance program (including equipment procurement and staff
training), the construction of the Zinder-Nigerian border
road (49 km) and a survey of Niger's road construction
industry; this project is scheduled to be completed by mid-
1981.
Projects have generally been well executed by DPW using mainly foreign con-
tractors and consultants.  Apart from some delays the projects have been                      £
largely problem free. The Association also assisted in financing the Niamey
International Airport Project (Cr. 473-NIR, US$5.0 million, 1974) and small

II. THE HIGHWAY SECTOR
A. The Road Network
2.01      Niger's road network consists of about 7,000 km of classified roads
and an identified 11,000 km of unclassified feeder roads and tracks of which
about 8,000 km carry vehicular traffie at some time during the year.  The
following table gives details of the road network.

1/  Mainly located in northern Niger (their improvement is not
included in the proposed project).
2/ Identified.
The main road axis, which is largely paved, runs east-west through the popu-
lated southern part of the country with north-south roads feeding into it.
The Government intends to construct another east-west link about 100 kms to
the north of this one by improving the existing roads and tracks. Most of the
classified road system is in reasonable condition and is generally adequate in
extent for Niger's needs. However, the earth road from Tahoua to Arlit (664
km), which carries growing traffic of 90,000 tons a year, is being paved to
Agadez and reconstructed to improved gravel standard from Agadez to Arlit.
Although the non-classified feeder roads and tracks (11,000 km) are adequate



- il -
in extent, they are of a very low standard. A large number of these roads
being very difficult and costly to use because of a lack of attention, the
absence of good road making materials, and easily eroded soils in many areas.
The Government recognizes the importarnce of feeder roads in rural development
and intends to start improving and maintaining them. The proposed project
would represent the first major effort in this field.
B. Road Traffic
2.02      The low level of rural development in Niger and the very low
standard of feeder roads and tracks ccntribute to the low traffic flows.  At
most, 5% of the 11,000 km of feeder roads carry more than 10 vehicles per day
(vpd). Except for the larger vehicles (>6 tons) used by OPVN, UNCC and SONARA
and limited to the better roads, most vehicular traffic consists of privately
operated small trucks, pick-ups and LaLnd Rovers which collect agricultural
produce and supply consumer goods and administrative services.
C. The Transport Industry
2.03      The table below gives 1977 figures for the vehicle fleet in Niger.
The estimated fleet is markedly lower than earlier official statistics (e.g.
17,000 vehicles in 1973) and thus growth trends cannot be derived. Fuel
consumption statistics, however, indicate an overall growth rate of about 5%
to 6% per annum.

2.04      MPWTU's Directorate of Transport (DT) regulates the transport
industry in Niger. The Societe Nationale de Transports Nigeriens (SNTN),
stateowned, but managed by the French group SAGA-Rothschild, controls about
60% of the industry. The majority of other public transport companies are
grouped together in the Syndicat des Transporteurs. The following table gives
a breakdown of the transport industry by company size.

1/ The majority of these are traders/transporters.
There is little price competition among the firms in categories 3), 4) and
6) where fixed tariffs exist. There is considerable competition among the
traders included under 1) and 2) and among the owners of dump trucks working
on contract. In this situation the improvement of agricultural feeder roads
under the proposed project is more likely to benefit the local population by
increasing farmgate prices through competition among transporter/traders than
through reductions in transport prices. SONARA and OPVN can use vehicle
operating cost (voc) savings for improving their input supply and marketing
services to the producers.
D.  Highway Administration and Maintenance
2.05      DPW is responsible for planning, constructing, improving and main-
taining the classified road network and a few sections of the nonclassified
system. The Ministry of the Interior, through its regional departments,
prefectures and sub-prefectures, is responsible for maintaining the nonclassi-
fied road network. The Genie Rural (GR) of the Ministry of Rural Development
(MRD) is responsible for some small access roads in agricultural projects and
roads in national parks.



- 13 -
Directorate of Public Works
2.06      DPW is divided into three departments:  Central Technical Department
is responsible for studies, planning and contract supervision; the Department
for Roads and New Construction is responsible for force account works and road
maintenance; and the Department for IJrbanism, Architecture and Housing. The
standard of routine maintenance of primary and secondary roads is generally
adequate; periodic maintenance is being strengthened under the Third Highway
Project.
2.07      Equipment maintenance is the responsibility of the Division of
Equipment which operates a central equipment pool. Other DPW divisions,
Government departments and other users rent equipment from this division. The
main workshop is located at Niamey with subsidiary workshops at Maradi and
Zinder and eight local service stations; there are also mobile workshops. The
capacity of the Zinder workshop is being increased (with assistance from the
United Nations Industrial Development Organization) to be able to carry out
all major maintenance. The Division of Equipment was satisfactorily reorgan-
ized under Credit 128-NIR but lacks certain trained personnel and, above all,
an efficient cost-accounting system for equipment use. The recently completed
"Diagnostic Study of Road Maintenance in the Sahel" 1/ identified a need for
improved maintenance of equipment and increased availability of spare parts.
The study estimated that Niger will need CFAF 3.2 billion (US$14.5 million)
between now and 1982 for new equipment and a 40% increase in spare parts. The
Government is studying equipment use, but without an efficient cost accounting
staff with a knowledge of engineering operations, there is a danger that the
study may not be effective. Some of these problems will be addressed through
the training program to be carried otut under the Third Highway Project with
the assistance of the consultant BCEOM (France). The training program should
be operational early in 1979 with establishment of a permanent training
organization. Under the proposed project these shortcomings will be addressed
as far as they relate to feeder roads.
Ministry of the Interior
2.08      The Ministry of the Interior, operating through the local administra-
tions, has no technical personnel and only very limited funds for maintenance
of feeder roads and tracks. The normal procedure is for the local authorities
to pay the DPW subdivision to carry out the maintenance works. Only an esti-
mated 5% of the feeder roads and tracks are to some extent maintained and
many of them have now deteriorated to such a degree that reconstruction is
required.

Genie Rural
2.09      Genie Rural (GR) is the rural engineering arm of the MRD and as
such is closely concerned with rural development projects. While it has built
and maintained some low standard roads, its main activity is constructing
wells, irrigation and other hydraulic works. In view of the increasing size
and importance of irrigation works, the Government plans to create a new
agency to take over this work. But since GR does not have enough experience
to take part in a road program, it has been decided to confide the execution
of the proposed project to DPW.
E. Road Planning and Construction
2.10      DPW is responsible for planning and constructing classified roads
and has "in house" capacity for the design and supervision of minor projects;
major road design is undertaken by foreign consultants. Apart from routine
road maintenance and one construction brigade working on secondary roads, DPW
has little experience with force account projects. However, under the Third
Highway Project four regravelling brigades are being created for the periodic
maintenance of primary and secondary gravel roads with an eventual program of
600 km p.a.
2.11      The domestic road construction industry is limited to two firms:
(a) Societe Nationale des Grands Travaux (owned by the Government
and the Niger Development Bank) has staff, including expatri-
ates, and equipment to undertake important road works
but more frequently participates in joint ventures with
foreign companies. It is participating in the Tahoua-Arlit
road project which will severely limit its capacity for
other works for the next three or four years. Until recently
its financial position was not sound.
(b) Wazir and Company is a relatively small, private contracting
firm which is constructing 80 km of road in the IDA-financed
Maradi Integrated Rural Development Project, but progress is
slow and costs (about CFAF 4.0 million/km) are high although
some of this is because high road standards have been adopted.
There are some private transport contractors who haul earth, sand and gravel,                  t
but they generally use old equipment and are restricted to the main urban
centers. There are also a number of small entrepreneurs who carry out small
structural works and who will be employed in building some road structures
under the proposed project. The Third Highway Project provides financing for a
consultant's study of the local contracting industry to work out a development
policy and to determine the technical and financial needs of the local road
construction industry. The recommendations of this study will be considered
in the implementation of the proposed project.

F. Financing Road Maintenance
2.12      Compared with other countries in Western Africa the classified road
maintenance performance of Niger is good -- 4.5% of total recurrent budget
expenditures were allocated to road maintenance in 1977, an average of US$1,000
per km. Under the Third Highway Project the Government has agreed to gradually
increase road maintenance expenditures from CFAF 1.171 billion (US$5.3 million)
in 1976 to CFAF 1.421 billion (US$6.5 million) in 1979. Niger has so far
exceeded this commitment. The following table gives details of highway main-
tenance expenditures for 1973 to 1977. Between 1974 and 1977 official esti-
mates indicate that the European and African price indices rose by about
40% and 30% respectively. Applying the higher European price escalation to
the maintenance figures there was a real increase in the maintenance budget of
about 23% between 1974 and 1977.

Maintenance of classified (and a small length of nonclassified) roads is
financed from road user charges on fuel, vehicles, spare parts, vehicle
licenses and registration which are allocated to the National Budget and the
National Investment Fund (FNI). 1/ In 1977 these taxes yielded an estimated

CFAF 1.8 billion (US$8.2 million). Road-user charges in Niger are relatively
low, averaging about CFAF 138,000 per vehicle per year, and there is scope for
an increase if required.
2.13      The Governnment has agreed to maintaîn the projecL roads.  By the end
of the proposed project about CFAF 25 million per year at 1978 prices would be
necessary for the routine maintenance of project roads (estimated to average
CFAF 25,000 per km/year). The Government will make a budgetary allocation for
the maintenance of feeder roads under the project with an allocation as
necessary for the program as defined for each year.  The procedure, which
would help to ensure adequate maintenance of these roads and would facilitate
maintenance cost accounting, has been agreed to by the Government.
2.14      The Transport Development Plan under review will include a long-term
strategy for constructing, improving and maintaining feeder roads including
allocation of necessary resources and possible institutional changes, and a
study of effective decentralization of the maintenance of feeder roads to
local authorities if it appears that this may be desirable in meeting local
needs more effectively. The Government has agreed to furnish those sections
of the Transport Development Plan pertaining to feeder roads to the Association.
III. THE PROJECT
A. General Description
3.01      The proposed project consists of a four-year program for the improve-
ment and subsequent maintenance of about 1,000 km of feeder roads, including.
(i) purchase of equipment, spare parts and workshop tools;
(ii) provision of materials and supplies;
(iii) construction of offices for FRTS;
(iv) construction and repair of small drainage structures by
local contractors;
(v)  technical assistance (about 210 man-months) comprising
(a) about 150 man-months to establish a Feeder Road
Technical Section (FRTS) within DPW to implement and
monitor the above program;
(b) about 40 man-months of training specialists in civil
and mechanical works using both formal and practical
training; and
(c) about 20 man-months of services of an economist/cost
accountant to analyze construction and maintenance costs
and methods, to establish a cost accounting unit, to
assist in the economic analysis and preparation of annual



- 17 -
work programs, to monitor the results of the project and
to prepare a longer term feeder road strategy and to
develop a follow-up program; and
(vi) purchase of training materials.
B. Feeder Road Program
3.02      The approximately 1,000 km of feeder roads and tracks to be improved
and subsequently maintained are located in areas where agricultural devel-
opment projects are planned or underway. About 1,300 km have been identified
from approximately 6,000 km located in important agricultural areas. DPW's
Department of Roads and New Works (SCRTN) through its Feeder Road Technical
Section (FRTS) will be equipped to improve and maintain the about 750 km of
the lower standard II roads and 250 km higher standard III roads finally
selected. FRTS will employ two heavy, mechanized brigades of which one will
be a production/training brigade, one light mechanized brigade and two light
maintenance units. The proposed improvements will consist of (a) bush clear-
ing, (b) shaping the formation, (c) gravelling sections, and (d) building and
repairing simple drainage structures. The design standards of the two levels
of improvement proposed are based on probable traffic flows during the next 10
years, topographical and soil conditions, and road network consistency; these
standards have been agreed upon with the Government.

for road improvements to be carried out has been established and agreed upon
(189 km) with the Government (Page 18). A tentative list of the remaining
roads from which the second and subsequent years' progeams will be drawn
is given on Page 19. The criteria for inclusion of roads in the program are:
(a) a minimum economic rate of return (ERR) of 10% for each
road, based on (i) the economic costs of road improvement
and maintenance; (ii) reductions in transport costs for
normal traffic, and (iii) reduced crop spoilage and lower
strategic food crop storage costs;
(b) that the roads be important components of economi-
cally justified agricultural development projects, both
ongoing and planned; and
(c) other important socio-economic benefits in accordance with
national development objectives.
The participation of local populations in road maintenance has been examined,
but for technical and economic reasons has been rejected as a criterion for
road improvement (para. 3.18). The Government has agreed to the first year's
program and the selection criteria outlined above.

3.04      The project includes equipment for the routine maintenance of roads
improved under the project. The Government would finance the operating costs.
The equipment would also be used initially to maintain about 500 km of feeder
roads not improved under the project. A maintenance program will be prepared
each year and submitted to the Association. Proposed maintenance standards
are the following:
(a)  formations will be maintained at their improved width
with, where appropriate, adequate camber to ensure
efficient disposal of water, and corrugations will be
removed and potholes filled with suitable material;
(b) drainage will be maintained at the improved standard
paying particular attention to the danger of erosion; and
(c) drainage structures will be kept structurally sound.
The Government has agreed to take all the necessary administrative, technical
and financial steps to maintain the project roads to an acceptable standard
during and after the project and to allocate funds to cover the costs of
maintaining project roads. Not later than May 31 of each year, Government
will review with the Association budgetary proposals for maintenance opera-
tions of the following fiscal year.
C. Equipment and Materials Purchases
3.05      The DPW does not have equipment to undertake the construction, im-
provement and maintenance of the 1,000 km of feeder roads envisaged in the
project. Thus the project provides for the procurement or in limited cases
rental of necessary equipment as listed in Chapter III, Table 1. The project
also provides for the purchase of spare parts, tools, fuel, lubricants, tires
and ancillary supplies. Bidding documents for equipment to be supplied under
the project will be prepared by consultants already working in Niger in order to
permit delivery by September 1979.  This has been agreed to by the Government
D. Workshops and Tools
3.06      The three improvement brigades will rely on existing DPW equipment
maintenance facilities for major repairs and overhauls; costs will be borne by
the project.  All routine equipment repairs and maintenance will be undertaken
by the brigades' own mobile workshops provided under the project. The brigades
will be equipped with radio communications facilities similar to the DPW system
already in operation. It is particularly important from the point of view of
analyzing and controling costs and productivity that the three road improvement
and two maintenance brigades accounts are kept separate from other operations'
accounts of the directorate, and this has been agreed to by the Government.
E.   Office Buildings
3.07      There is not sufficient office accommodation available for the
Feeder Road Technical Section in existing Government buildings. The proposed
project, therefore, includes the construction and equipping of an office
building for the newly created unit.



- 21 -
F. Technical Assistance
3.08      Due to the limited availability of local qualified staff at all
levels, particularly with force-account experience, about 210 man months of
technical assistance will be provided under the project by 11 experts to
assist DPW to:
(a) execute the feeder road project including:
(i)  defining and planning the annual construction,
improvement and maintenance programs;
(ii)  preparing detailed implementation plans, including
evaluation of bidding documents and contracts for
civil works and equipment;
(iii) implementing feeder road construction, improvement
and maintenance programs including supervision of
contracted civil works;
(iv)  monitoring the engineering, economic and social
aspects of the program paying particular attention
to productivity and costs, traffic growth and trans-
port costs and population movements; and
(v)  training DPW staff at all levels, but particularly
senior civil works technicians, civil works foremen,
mechanics, plant operators and cost analysts, through
formal and practical training;
(b) elaborate a proposal for a strategy to identify and meet
feeder road construction, improvement and maintenance
needs including:
(i)  determining the most appropriate technology to be
used and feeder roads standards to be adopted;
(ii)  defining the most suitable institutional structure,
especially for feeder road maintenance;
*
(iii) studying the use and ieffectiveness of small local
contractors; and
(iv)  preparing cost estimates for future feeder road
programs including construction, improvement and
maintenance of feeder roads.
The technical assistance staff will be phased out during the course of the
project and in the final year operations will be run entirely by Nigerien
staff. The local staff and technical assistance staff are listed in Chapter
III, Table 2. The consulting firm wiIl be selected no later than April 30,
1979. The Chief of Mission (highway engineer) will be recruited and take up
his duties by September 30, 1979, with all other experts arriving as necessary
for project implementation. These arrangements, the experts' draft Terms of
Reference (Annex 4), qualifications r-equired and duration of assignments have
been discussed with Government and agreed upon.



- 22 -
3.09      The Government has agreed that local counterpart staff as listed in
Table 2 would be recruited and assigned to the project as the respective
consultant personnel take up their posts.
G. Training
3.10      The first group of equipment operators will be trained by the sup-
pliers of equipment to be purchased under the project; bidding documents for
equipment will include this provision.  However, the main training effort
will be carried out by means of the production/training brigade and formal
classroom training for which two training specialists will be employed;
this will be coordinated with the training component of the Third Highway
Project.  The approximate numbers of Nigerien staff to be trained, allowing
for dropouts, are:
20 Civil Engineering Technicians and overseers
(Chiefs of Brigades)
8 Diesel Mechanics
8 Electrical Mechanics
16 General Mechanics
30 Equipment Operators
80 Drivers
3 Civil Engineering Training Officers
3 Mechanical Training Officers
Training will be specially directed at equipment operators, mechanics and
foremen. Training by experience will also take place on the standard produc-
tion brigades with, if need be, short term follow-up training aided by the
training specialists. During negotiations, the Goverument agreed to the
outline training program (Annex 5) and to furnish a detailed training program
within four months after Credit effectiveness. The training component is
estimated to require about 40 man months of technical assistance but will be
closely coordinated with the training component of the Third Highway Project
and will make use of the same facilities. Classroom equipment and teaching
materials will be financed under the proposed feeder road project for the
additional students using the facilities. The sharing of training facilities
between the two projects has been agreed to by Government.
H. Project Monitoring
3.11      The proposed project includes project monitoring functions described
below. These will be undertaken by FRTS and DPW but the participation of
local agencies interested in research will also be considered during the course
of the project.
3.12      Project monitoring activities will be coordinated with those under the
Third Highway Project and will include:
(a) the analysis of productivity and costs of the DPW force
account brigades and small local contractors in the civil
works carried out;



- 23 -
(b) ccllecting data on the quality of road construction, improve-
ment and maintenance works and the rate of road deterioration
in relation to standards, miaterials, rainfall, maintenance
and traffic;
(c) undertaking statistically clesigned traffic counts on a
sample of roads (using both automatic 1/ and visual counts)
to establish traffic levels, composition and growth;
(d) undertaking periodic measurements of (i) population, (ii)
agricultural production ancl marketing, (iii) imports of
foodstuffs and agricultural inputs, (iv) changes in farm
gate prices for marketed produce, imports of food crops and
agricultural inputs, (v) the use made of education, health
and farm extension services, and (vi) household budgets; and
(e) collecting and updating inf-ormation on vehicle operating
costs and transport charges on improved and unimproved
roads.
In collecting these data the FRTS wiLl cooperate closely with other Goverument
agencies having interests in these areas: in particular the Sectoral and
Regional Planning Services of the Ministry of Planning.
I. Cost Estimates
3.13      The total cost of the project, including US$120,000 for taxes to be
paid by local contractors and US$200,000 advanced from the Project Preparation
Facility, is estimated at US$13.00 million, with a foreign exchange cost of
US$9.32 million (73%).  Taxes and duities estimated at US$2.2 million are not
included in the project cost estimates. The table on page 24 shows project
costs (details of project costs by year are given in Table 3 at the end of the
chapter). The Government has agreed to provide the recurrent maintenance
costs for project roads during, and iafter implementation (estimated at approxi-
mately US$0.3 million for the project period); these costs are not included in
project estimates.
1/   The use of automatic counts is essential on low traffic volume roads if
reliable data are to be obtained.

3.14       Estimates of the cost of equipment and tools have been based on
April 1978 prices in Niger. Operating costs of equipment are based on 200
working days per annum using current Niger costs, which have also been
compared with costs in neighboring countries, and assuming an average of 6
hours operation per day. The average productivity of the training brigade
has been estimated at about 70% of a normal brigade. The estimated average
costs per km including equipment depreciation but excluding contingencies, net
of taxes, for road construction and improvement are as follows:
Road Type                                    Cost per km
8 m formation and 6 m gravelled widttL
where necessary (Class III)                              US$8,700
6 m formation and 5 m gravelled width
where necessary (Class II)                               US$6,000
3.15       The cost of consultants (it may be necessary to employ two separate
consultant firms or a joint venture in view of the specialized training
element) has been estimated at US$7,500 per man-month. Of this about US$5,500
is estimated to cover salary, overheads, social security charges and overseas
allowances. Reimbursable expenses (housing, travel, etc.) are estimated to
average about US$2,000 per man month. These figures are based on recent
consultants' proposals in the Western Africa region.
3.16      A quantity contingency of 5% for equipment and spare parts and
10% for all other items has been included. Provision for future price rises
on all items has been estimated in line with recent Bank Group Guidelines as
follows: 7.0% in 1978, 6.5% in 1979, and 6.0% thereafter for equipment and
spare parts; for other items 8.0% in 1978, 7.5% in 1979 and 7.0% thereafter.
These amount to about 20% of total project costs in April 1978 prices.
J. Execution
3.17      The Ministry of Planning (MP) will have overall administrative
responsibility for the execution of tlhe project, operating through an Inter-
Ministerial Feeder Road Committee (IMFC) serviced by a Feeder Road Technical
Section (FRTS) in the SCRTN of DPW.  ]FRTS will be directly responsible to the
Director of SCRTN and will be the body charged with planning and executing the
proposed project. It will be staffed by Nigerien personnel who will be
assisted in the initial stages of the project by about 210 man-months of tech-
nical assistance (para. 3.07).  The IMFC will be presided over by a representa-
tive of the MP and will include representatives of MTPTU, MRD, the ministries
of the Interior and Finance and such other members as may be decided.



- 26 -
3.18      The program of road construction and improvement for the second
and subsequent years of the project will be based on proposals made by indi-
vidual ministries and Government agencies -- in particular the ministries of
Public Works, Interior and Rural Development -- and subsequently analyzed and
prepared by the FRTS. The proposed program of economically justified, pri-
ority roads will be sent to IMFC for approval. The approved program will be
submitted to the Association for its agreement at least two months before
the start of each year's road improvement program. Roads would be selected
according to criteria detailed in para. 3.03. The method of selection and
criteria was agreed upon during negotiations. Establishment of the IMFC and
the FRTS would be conditions of Credit effectiveness.
3.19      Physical execution of the project is scheduled to begin in January
1980 and to be completed by the end of 1983 as is shown on the implementa-
tion schedule (Chart 1). Except for the building of offices, small structures
and some transport of road-building materials, in which local contractors will
participate, road improvements and maintenance will be carried out by force
account.
3.20      The appropriateness of using different technologies in road improve-
ment and maintenance has been examined by the consultant and the appraisal
mission. Experience of labor intensive road works in Niger has been limited
to a section of road in the area of Iferouane in the Air Mountains financed by
German aid and supervised by consultants specializing in intermediate tech-
nology and labour intensive methods. The average cost per km was very high at
about CFAF 4.0 million (US$17,000). While these costs may not be typical nor
were the local conditions comparable with those in the southern part of the
country, the experience demonstrated the difficulties of using labor intensive
methods in Niger. In particular population densities are relatively low,
logistical problems are considerable (especially food and water supply) and
productivity of manual labor is low owing to the very high temperatures during
most of the year. Also the uranium mines at Arlit, which are being expanded,
and Nigerian industry are attracting much of the available Nigerien labor.
Theoretical calculations carried out by the consultant show that, employing a
shadow price of labor of 40%, road improvement costs using labor intensive
methods would be of the order of CFAF 3.8 million/km. Mainly for these
reasons Government is not prepared to undertake major civil works using labor
intensive methods. The FRTS, with the assistance of consultants, will
undertake studies of appropriate techniques in roadworks. The proposed
project envisages the employment of small local contractors (tacheron) in the
building of structures such as fords, small bridges and culverts and this will
be essentially labor intensive work. During the course of the project a
study of the operations of these small contractors will be undertaken as part
of the technical assistance effort and use will be made of the results of
the study of the national road construction industry which is about to start
under the Third Highway Project (para. 2.10).



- 27 -
3.21      In some areas of Niger where terrain is easy, soils light and gravel
materials easily available, heavy equipment intensive construction brigades are
not the most economic solution. In these cases a light mechanized construction/
improvement brigade is most suitable for undertaking road improvements. In
other areas where topography and soil types warrant, the heavy mechanized road
improvement brigade is the better solution. Also, for equipment operator,
mechanic and technician training a heavy mechanized brigade would be the best
medium. Consequently the road improvement works will be executed as follows:
Standard III Roads (about 250 km). One heavy mechanized brigade, which will
also serve as a training brigade, will be responsible for the improvement of
these roads. Estimated annual output is 70 km.
Standard II Roads (about 750 km). These roads will be improved using brigades
as follows:
(a) one heavy mechanized brigade with an estimated output of
100 km a year; and
(b) one light mechanized brigade with capacity for improving
about 70 km a year.
Maintenance of feeder roads improved by these brigades will be undertaken by
the existing DPW maintenance organization but the project will finance equip-
ping two light routine maintenance units for the maintenance of the project
roads. This equipment would have capacity to maintain an additional 500 km of
feeder roads not included in the improvement program until it is fully required
for the project. The FRTS will ensure that maintenance of project roads is
carried out effectively by the DPW sub-divisions.
K. Procurement
3.22      Equipment, vehicles, buildings, materials and supplies amounting to
about US$6.6 million (net of taxes) will be procured on the basis of inter-
national competitive bidding in accordance with Bank Group Guidelines.
Contracts for equipment, materials, vehicles and supplies costing under
US$60,000 (equivalent) may be awarded on the basis of local competitive
bidding following local procedures acceptable to the Association. The aggre-
gate amount of such purchases shall not exceed US$400,000 (equivalent) without
approval of the Association.  Contracts for building small structures and the
transport of materials totalling about US$300,000 (equivalent) will follow
local competive bidding procedures acceptable to the Association. Consultants
will be employed in agreement with and under terms of reference and conditions
satisfactory to the Association. The Government has agreed to the above

L. Financing and Disbursements
3.23      The total project cost net of taxes and duties is estimated at
US$13.0 million.  The proposed credit of US$10.0 million will finance about
77% of total project costs net of taxes, i.e., 100% of foreign costs and
about 18% of local costs. The Government will finance 82% of local costs, for
a total of about US$3.8 million. Associated with the project, but not included
in cost estimates are US$0.3 million for operating costs of routine maintenance
of project roads, also to be financed by Government. The financing plan of
the project is shown in Table 4 at the end of the Chapter.
3.24      Credit funds would be disbursed as follows:
(a) 100% of the foreign cost of imported equipment, vehicles,
spare parts, office equipment, workshop equipment, tools,
materials, fuel and lubricants or 80% of the local costs
of these items if purchased locally;
(b) 25% of local labor costs;
(c) 58% of civil works done by contractors;
(d) 70% of office construction and equipment by contractors;
(e) 85% of total expenditures for technical assistance services;
(f) 100% of training materials; and
(g)  US$200,000 already disbursed from Project Preparation
Facility.
Requests for disbursements will be fully documented. Disbursements for civil
works carried out by force account would be made against certificates of
expenditure with the supporting documentation retained by the Borrower and
kept available for inspection during the course of supervision missions. Based
on the above disbursement percentages and the project implementation schedule
shown in Chart I, the schedule of disbursements from the credit account is
estimated as shown below.

IV. ECONOMIC EVALUATION
A. General
4.01      Although uranium concentrates from the mines at Arlit have become
a major foreign currency earner and revenue producer for the Government, produc-
ing 60% in value of exports and 16% of domestic revenue, the mining industry
still contributes only 4% of GDP. About 90% of the population rely directly
or indirectly on agriculture and livestock, and this situation will continue
for the foreseeable future.  The agricultural population, which has an average
per capita income less than US$50, is dependent on an agriculture that is pre-
carious in most areas owing to the ever present threat of drought, impover-
ished soils due to overcultivation, and unsatisfactory husbandry systems.
These problems are compounded by difficulties in delivering inputs and exten-
sion services and in marketing produce. In its 1976-1978 economic and
social program the Government is making a determined effort to increase both
agricultural production and the standard of living of the rural population.
This strategy of rural development will continue during the Five Year Plan due
to start in 1979.
4.02      Agricultural investment centers on (a) development of irrigated
farming as a buffer to the deleterious effects of drought; and (b) the
improvement of productivity in the rainfed farming areas. External sources
are providing most of the funds for these developments. The main projects are
the following:

4.03      One of the most serious physical constraints upon development of
agricultural areas is the inadequate feeder road system.  In some areas
vehicular transport, while possible during most of the year, is extremely
expensive, slow and unreliable; in other areas access is possible only by
relatively high cost four-wheel drive vehicles. Animal transport is used to a
considerable extent, particularly camels, where vehicular transport is not
possible. Current tariffs indicate, however, that camel transport, apart from
being slow (3 to 4 days per 100 km), is almost twice the cost of truck trans-
port on improved feeder roads.
4.04      The general standard of feeder roads is such that the larger vehi-
cles (>6 tons) used by the market:Lng agencies can serve only limited areas.
Not only are unit operating costs high but additional costs are incurred
through having to use small trucks. For example, the cost per ton/km using a
pick-up vehicle on poorly built and maintained feeder roads is nearly 10 times
higher than for an 8 ton truck on an adequately built and maintained road.
4.05      The planning, development and maintenance of feeder roads in Niger
has received very little attention due to (a) the need to improve the primary
and secondary roads and to raise standard of maintenance; (b) financial and
manpower constraints; and (c) the lack of an adequate institutional structure
for planning and executing feeder road projects. The proposed project repre-
sents the first major integrated effort to correct these deficiencies in the
feeder road subsector.
4.06      In the proposed feeder road project particular importance is placed
on the institutional and training aspects which will represent important
non-quantifiable benefits.
Institutions: (a) The project will lead to closer coordination in feeder
road planning and investment through a coordinating Inter-Ministerial Feeder
Road Committee (IMFC); (b) for the first time DPW will play an active role
in the construction and maintenance of feeder roads by force account and
will develop a long term maintenance strategy for feeder roads which may
include other agencies; and (c) the project would ensure that feeder roads
are built to economically justified standards. 1/
Training: The project through the production and training brigade and
formal training will increase the number of qualified Nigerien staff
especially at the important sub-professional levels.
B. Economic and Social Justification
Methodology
4.07      The roads chosen for inclusion in the proposed feeder road project
are important components of identified agricultural development projects
_/   In the past the few feeder roads built by DPW have been overdesigned.

(para. 3.03). This is their essential justification. The agricultural devel-
opment projects of which they are a part are given in para. 4.02 together
with estimates of the ERR for the projects the calculation of which included
estimates of road investment costs. However, in the economic analysis (see
Annex 3) it was not possible to attribute reliably a proportion of the value
added benefits accruing to the agricultural development projects to the pro-
posed road improvements. The project roads' economic rate of return of 10%
over 10 years has been achieved using the following benefits only: (a)
transport cost savings to normal traffic; (b) estimated savings in crop
spoilage at present (normal year) production levels; and (c) savings in
strategic storage of subsistence crops at present population levels. The
proposed project will provide about 400,000 people with improved access to
social services, administration and markets which will be an important factor
in future economic development.
Costs
4.08      In the economic justification economic costs and benefits have been
used throughout. Costs include construction, recurrent maintenance and
regravelling after seven years.
Transport Cost Savings
4.09      Vehicle flows have been calculated on the basis of the volume of
marketed agricultural surpluses and on the volume of imported produce in the
case of deficit areas; in some areas both deficits and surpluses may exist.
Agricultural surplus/deficit estimates are based on an "average" year with
existing farming methods and infrastructure -- no induced production due to
the road has been taken into account. It has been estimated that on existing
tracks 80% of tonnage is carried in four-wheel drive vehicles and pickups with
a rated 1-ton capacity; the remaining 20% of tonnage is carried in trucks with
an 8 ton capacity. Relatively expensive four-wheel drive vehicles would no
longer be used for freight on the improved feeder roads and 30% of freight
would be carried in pickups and 70% in 8-ton trucks. Marketed/imported ton-
nages of crops have been assumed to be distributed evenly along the road and
the load factor is considered to be 50% both before and after road improvement.
Conservatively, passenger and non-agricultural freight traffic has been
assumed to be carried with existing agricultural freight traffic. Only normal
traffic is included in the calculations and this is projected to grow at 5%
per annum (the predicted national average for traffic growth) over the analysis
period.
4.10      Transport cost savings represented by reductions in typical vehicle
operating costs on improved feeder roads compared with existing tracks are
given in the table below. There can be considerable local differences ac-
cording to soil type and topography. No voc are available for four-wheel
drive vehicles and only pick-up voc have been employed: however, voc for
four-wheel drive vehicles are higher than for pick-ups.

Source:  Consultant BCEOM "L'Entretien Routier du Niger 1974" (updated to
1978 by the mission). Tracks are considered to correspond to "very bad" and
the improved roads to "good".
Other Benefits
4.11      In addition to transport cost savings, the road improvements are
estimated to lead to reduced crop wastage and food crop storage costs in the
following ways:
Crop Wastage: Crop wastage in Niger is estimated to be between 15% and 30%
of production except for cotton. Wastage occurs because (a) crops are left
in the fields too long; (b) they deteriorate due to primitive storage; and
(c) they are lost in storage to pests and vermin. It is predicted that
improved transport resulting in more timely crop evacuation and delivery of
inputs will lead to a reduction in the current levels of wastage. Although
no precise measurements have been undertaken it has been assumed, following
discussions with agricultural authorities, that 5% of total marketed/imported
crop value may be saved given reliable road communications.
Reduced Storage Costs: Strategic food crop storage costs using modern fa-
cilities are estimated to be CFAF 7,500 per ton/year. Improved roads will
lead to more efficient distribution systems. This should lead to either (a)
a reduction in the amount of storage facilities required; or (b) to reduc-
tions in strategic food crop losses due to open storage being used and food
being lost through natural causes and pilferage. These reductions cannot be
measured exactly and conservatively have been assumed to be 5% of food crop
storage needs for the areas concerned or CFAF 75 per person/year.
4.12      As a result of the economic analysis of each road identified as
essential components of agricultural projects, and using as benefits voc
savings (76% of gross benefits), crop wastage savings (16% of gross bene-
fits), and food crop storage benefits (8% of gross benefits), approximately
890 km of road have an individual ERR greater than 10% and an overall ERR of
21%. Changes in costs and benefits have the following effects on the rates of
return:

ERR
(a)  Best estimate                                            21%
(b)  Project costs + 20%                                      14%
(c)  Project benefits - 20%                                   13%
(d)  Vehicle operating cost savings only                      11%
(e)  Project cost + 20% and benefits - 20%                    7%
An additional 140 km of road in Maradi Department and 285 km of road in
Niamey Department have been identified as important to agricultural projects,
but these roads can probably only be justified as part of the agricultural
development projects. They are noted in Chapter III, Table 2, and should be
examined in greater detail during the course of the proposed project before
being included in the work program.  The first year's road improvement pro-
gram with an overall ERR of 26% (Annex I) has been compiled as far as pos-
sible on the basis of the priority of the different agricultural projects.
Flexibility has been permitted in the project's second and subsequent year
programs in order that the changing road needs of agricultural projects may
be met. Although the same economic criteria should be used in justifying any
particular road in the program ranking of project roads will be based primarily
on the timing of the need for the road vis a vis agricultural development
projects. Additionally greater weight may be given to basic social needs
necessary as a basis for longer term economic development. A sample calcula-
tion for a typical project road is given at Annex 3.
Distribution of Project Benefits
4.13      Benefits would be distributed as follows:  Vehicle operating costs
savings by the large state corporations such as SONARA and OPVN will probably
be retained although some may be passed on in the form of improved services to
local cooperatives and farmers. Competition between private merchants will
increase as transport becomes easier and part of the decrease in transport
costs will be passed on to farmers and villagers, most likely as higher farm
gate prices and lower prices for imported commodities. This will only relate
to perceived savings on the part of the transporter which normally account for
about 50%. Gains from reduced crop spoilage will accrue directly to the
producer and reduced storage costs will go mainly to OPVN.
Project Risk
4.14      The project faces no special risks.  The strong technical assistance
element should reduce the possibility of inefficient project execution and the
road improvements are economically justified independently from the agricultural
projects which they serve. Little can be done in the short term to avert the
effects of natural calamities such as drought, but improved communications
will ease relief measures.

FEEDER ROAD PROJECT
Outline Training Program
1.        A training program for equipment operators, mechanics, and civil
works technicians is being established within DPW under the Third Highway
Project, and this should commence operations in early 1979. The demand
for trained staff will, however, be increased as a result of the three road
construction/improvement brigades established under the proposed project.
Allowing for defection, it is anticipated that the following staff will
require training:
Personnel Type                                                  No.
(a)  civil engineering technicians and overseers                20
(b)  equipment operators                                        30
(c)  drivers                                                    80
(d)  mechanics - diesel       (8)                               32
- electrical (8)
- general    (16)
2.        It is estimated that employing classroom training and practical
training in the taining brigade and depending on quality of trainees, the
average training cycles will be:
(a) civil engineering technicians - 4 to 6 months
(b)  equipment operators             - 4 months
(c)  drivers                         - 2 months
(d)  mechanics                       - up to 8 months
After completion of the training cycle and about one year's field service, the
most suitable graduates may be selected for additional training to qualify them
as instructors.
3.        Formal "classroom" training will be integrated with the program and
facilities established under the Third Highway Project. Field training will
be carried out specifically in the proposed training brigade but training will
also be undertaken to some extent in the two other brigades.



- 52 -
ANNEX 5
Page 2
4.        Two training experts will be employed to undertake the training
program and they should be integrated as far as possible into the training
program established under the Third Highway Project. One expert will be in
the field of civil engineering and the other in mechanical engineering and
equipment maintenance. The majority of the experts' effort will be in the
field with the training brigade and from time to time with the two other
brigades; as necessary, the experts will also supply supplementary training
effort to classoom training established under the Third Highway Project. Each
expert will be employed for 20 man-months.
5.        Details of the training program curriculum will be established in
collaboration with the Third Highway Project's training program and the re-
cruitment of trainees will be carried out jointly.
6.        Particular importance will be placed on the identification of
potential Nigerien instructors and their subsequent additional training and
participation in the training program.
