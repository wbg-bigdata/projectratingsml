FEEDER ROADS PROJECT (CREDIT 886-NIR)
PROJECT COMPLETION REPORT
PREFACE
This is a Project Completion Report (PCR) of the Niger Feeder
Roads Project, for which Credit 886-NIR, in the amount of US$10.0
million, was approved on March 20, 1979. The credit was closed on
June 30, 1987, three years later than estimated at appraisal.
US$9.97 million of the credit were disbursed, and US$0.03 million
were cancelled.
The PCR was produced by staff of the Africa Region cn the basis
of a draft report prepared by the Borrower, which was discussed with
a project completion mission in June 1987. The PCR took account of
the project's Staff Appraisal Report (SAR), the President's Report,
the Credit Agreement and internal Bank memoranda and reports on
project implementation and issues contained in relevant files.
This PCR was read by the Operations Evaluation Department (OZD).
The draft PCR was sent to the Borrower on February 28, 1989, for
comments by April 16, 1989, but none were received.

NIGER
FEEDER ROADS PROJECT (CREDIT 886-NIR)
PROJECT COMPLETION REPORT
Evaluation SuInaC
Introduction and Obiectives
i.       About 1,000 km of feeder roads and tracks were to be improved and
then maintained in areas where agricultural development was either planned
or at implementation stage. Additional revenues would thus accrue to farmers
and trarsporters of farm input and output in those areas. The project
included provision of equipment, materials, and technical assistance needed
by the Feeder Roads Technical Section it established to carry out the four-
year program.
Imilementation Experience
ii.      The force account works started in October 1980 instead of January
as planned. Cumbersome procurement and strikes account for tile delay (para.
3.02). rhe three brigades, two heavy and one light, were unable to reach the
productivity targets owing to adverse terrain conditions and the poor
performance of equipment and of the equipmenLt maintenance team (paras. 3.04
& 3.05). The closing date was externded twice and the construction program
revised to a lower target of 800 km. At projeut completion it. June 1986, some
650 km of feeder roads and 150 km of connecting side roads had been completed
(para. 3.13). The construction costs overran the appraisal estimates by about
50% , partly because the roads standards had been upgraded to ensure all-
weather access (para. 3.06).
Results
iii.     Agricultural production in the influence area of the roads did not
increase as expected. This is traced to drought but also to the failure of
the rural development projects, as most farmers failed to adopt the new
methods (para. 4.05 c). The sharp decline in the production of cash crops
found some compensation however in the unexpected and remarkable progres.s of
off-season crops, very much dependant on reliable road transport (para.
4.07). Traffic on the improved roads grew 30X faster than expected at
appraisal, but remained low ( paras. 4.03 & 4.12). Long distance migration
were unaffected, whereas concentration of population in the villages and
areas close to the roads was noticeable (para. 4.05 b). The transport supply
remained generally constrained throughout the project area and surveys
revealed a substitution of private cars, vans and light trucks for the four-
wheel drive vehicles previously utilized (para. 4.05 e).



- vi -
Sustainability
iv.       A feeder road unit was developed within the Directorate of Public
Works for planning and execution of construction works. At project completion
date, the unit still showed definite weaknesses, both in management and
maintenance areas. Training by consultants largely failed, for lack of
suitable counterparts and consultant's neglect (para. 3.28 ). The three
brigades suffered from local cumbersome procurement causing late availability
of equipment, whith in addition performed poorly (para. 3.15). The force
account works howe 'er proved satisfactory quality wise (para. 6.01). Local
funding remained tnsufficient for maintenance of rural roads, making it
dependant on foreigi financing (para. 5.04).
Findints and Lessons
The project was successful. Its economic rate of retuirn was
recalculated as 242 , compared to the appraisal estimate of 211 (para,  I 1).
The principal lessons learned are:
(a) the project showed unexpected links between access improvement and
improved welfare for rural people (para. 5.05), which should be
taken into account by follow-up operations.
.b) equipment should be carefully selected, with due consideration to
local conditions and maintenance capabilities.
(c) the swift response of transport supply to improved road conditions,
truckers included, calls for deaigning feeOsr roads at standards
ensuring investment sustainability (para. 5.03)
(d) the opening of a revolving fund in 1985 helped reducing payment
delays, to the benefit of small contractors and of wage earners
participating in the project (para. 3.25).



NIGER
FEEDER ROADS PROJECT (CREDIT 886-NIR)
PROJECT COMPLETION REPORT
I. INTRODUCTION
1.01.   The Republic of Niger is a landlocked country of about 1.27 million
kva2, located between coastal West Africa end the Maghrebian Sahara.
Agriculture, which accounts for more than 80% of total employment, is limited
to about 150,000 km2 or about 12Z of the total land area along the southern
border. The population of approximately 6 million had a per capita income of
US US$325 equivalent in 1986, making Niger one of the poorest countries in
the world.   Since independence,  Niger has given high priority to the
construction and maintenance of a road ne-.work serving all parts of the
country. In 1978 the improved road network covered approximately 5,000 km.
1.02.    The Feeder Roads Project (Cr. 886-NIR) was the fifth IDA-financed
road project in Niger.   The First Highway Project  (Cr. 55-NIR, US$1.5
million, 1964) consisted of engineering and construction of about 60 km of
roads mainly serving groundnut producing regions. The Highway Maintenance
Project (Cr. 128-NIR, US$6.47 million, 1968) addressed Niger's highway
maintenance needs and also included pre-investment studies which led to the
Second Highway Project. The Second Highway Project (Cr. 231-NIR, US$6.55
million, 1971) provided for the construction of about 140 km of roads and
detailed design for another 170 km. The Third Highway Project (Cr. 612-NIR,
US$15.6 million, 1976) covered a four-year highway maintenance program
(including equipment purchase and training), and construction of 49 km of
roads from Maradi and Zinder to the Nigerian border, as well as a survey of
Niger's road construction industry. This project was cofinanced by BADEA and
the African Development Fund. IDA also assisted in financing the Niamey
International Airport (Cr. 473-NIR, US$5.0 million, 1976) and small feeder
road components in the Drought Relief Project (Cr. 441-NIR, US$2.0 million,
date) and the Maradi Integrated Rural Development Project (Cr. 608-NIR,
US$10.7 million, 1976). In general, these projectts were well executed using
mainly foreign consultants and contractors.
1.03.    Niger's internal transport system consists essentially of road
transport.   External transport requirements are largely met by road or
road/rail routes between Niger and the ports of Cotonou (Benin), Loma (Togo),
Abidjan (Ivory Coast), and Lagos (Nigeria).   In 1978, the road netbork
consisted of about 18,000 kms, of which about 11,000 kms were unclassified
rural roads and tracks and 6,923 kms were classified roads, of which 1,761
kms were paved. From 1970 to 1977, CFAF 35.5 billion (t'S$154 million) was
invested in road construction and improvement, of which external financing
accounted for about 85X.   Road maintenance was financed from Government
sources (National Budget and National Investmenz Fund).
1.04.   The Government's initial efforts focused on the main road network,
designed to facilitate external communications and to provide links between
the major urban centers. The drought of the early seventies first drew the
Government's attention to the problem of rural access. The low density of
secondary and rural roads prevented a significant part of the population from



-2-
gaining access to food aid provided by the international community.   In
addition, lack of access was perceived as a major constraint on rural
development initiatives.
1.05.   At appraisal in 1918, Bank Group lending fot Niger was increasingly
focused on efforts to ensure food self-sufficiency and to improve the income
and standards of living of the rural population; to upgrade physical
infrastructure and improve its maintenance; to develop alternative approaches
to training and educational reform; and to diversify the economic structure
and expand modern sector employment.   In the transport sector,  it was
anticipated that future emphasis would be placed on assistance for the
construction of secondary and access roads to support the Government's.
agricultural program, while continuing support for maintenance of the
existing infrastructure. The Feeder Roads Project was expected to be the
first step towards this objective by providing for feedefr road needs and by
integrating their planning, construction, improvement rnd maintenance into
the overall transport sector strategy. Also, it pro-.'led an institutional
structure to improve coordination in feeder road p. .nning and execution
between the Ministries of Plan, Rural Development, Interior, and Public
Works, Transport and Urban Development, by establishing an Interministerial
Feeder Roads Committee.
1.06.    Overall responsibility for project implementation was assigned to
the Ministry of Plan.   Planning and execution of the project was to be
carried out by the newly created Feeder Road Technical Section in the
Department of Public Works. Because of their important role in project
Implementation, establishment of the Interministerial Committee and of the
Feeder Road Technical Section were made conditions of project effectiveness.
1.07.    The project was highly successful.   Construction targets were
substantially achieved in terms of construction quantities, although the
introduction of higher standards required a reduction from the original
length of road to be constructed (para. 3.06). Institutional objectives were
fully attained in that counterpart staff carried out their responsibilities
in a very able manner long after the technical assistance staff left the
country. The Interministerial Committee continues to play an important role
in coordinating investment planning between the agriculture and transport
sectors.
1.08.   This report is based on documents available in the West Africa
Information Center files and on a draft report prepared by the Borrower,
which was discussed with a project completion mission in June 1987.
II. PROJECT IDENTIFICATION. PREPARATION AND APPRAISAL
Identification
2.01.  Prior to the project, feeder roads and tracks in Niger were generally
in poor condition and in need of improvement. In the period from 1969 to
1975, the Government concentrated on improving its primary and secondary road



- 3 -
network, and relatively little effort was put into feeder roads.  Feeder
roads, nearly all unclassified, were the responsibility of local
authorities, who did not have adequate financial or physical resources for
maintenance and improvement. The Nigerien Government expressed a need for
improvements to the feeder road system, and a reconnaissance mission in
November 1975 identified the need for a separate feeder roads improvement
and maintenance program. The project was identified in May 1976.
Preparation and Appraisal
2.02. The Government had undertaken a Transport Plan Study in 1976, which
was expected to take two years to complete. Although it incorporated some
information on rural roadsf it was not adequate to prepare a project.
Consequently, in November 1976 the Goverrment requested and IDA approved
US$200,000 from its Froject Preparation Facility to carry out a Feeder Road
Study. The study was completed by consultants BCEOM in mid-1978. During
project preparation, particular emphasis was placed on the importance of
examining the developmental impact of rural road improvements, and on the
use of appropriata construction and maintenance technologies.
2.03.   Appraisal was carried out in April 1978.  Given the relatively low
volumes of expected traffic and the high anticipated construction costs, the
appraisal mission recommended lowering the improvement standards proposed by
the Goverament and the consultants. Post-appraisal missions were carrled out
in July and December 1978 to resolve issues with the Government on technical
and organization&. matters raised during the appraisal mission.
Negotiations and Board Approval
2.04.   Project negotiations were held from January 9 to 12, 1979.  During
negotiations, it was agreed that equipment financed by the project could also
be used to maintain 500 km of improved rural roads not constructed under the
project. The Association also agreed to the Niger delegation's request to
delete the condition requiring an independent audit of project accounts,
since these would be part of the aacounts of the Ministry of Public Works
which are audited by the State Inspector. Also, at their request, IDA agreed
to change the establishment ot the Interministerial Committee from a
ccndition of Board presentation to a condition of effectiveness. Lastly, IDA
agreed to finanua construction of offices for the Feeder Roads Technical
Section and the purchase of training materials, 1y reducing a corresponding
amount from local labor costs for civil works.
2.05.    The Board approved the credit on March 20, 1979.   The Credit
Agreements -iere signed on April 22, 1979. The Inter- ministerial Committee
was officially created in September 1979, and the project became effective
on December 10, 1979. Effectiveness took place approximately six months later
than expected due to lengthy administrative procedures in Niger.

Pro1ect Obiectives and Description
2.06.  The main objective of the project was construction, improvement, and
subsequent maintenance of about 1,000 km of feeder roads serving agricultural
development areas. The Government decided to execute this program through
force account in order to create the necessary institutional structure for
development and execution of comprehensive feeder road programs.
Consequently, considerable emphasis was placed on training local staff.
Works were to be executed by three brigades using varying degrees of labor
and equipment, in order to test the feasibility of alternative technologies
in the Niger setting. The main components of the project were:
(a) Purchase of equipment, spare parts, and workshop
tools and equipment;
(b) Provision of materials and supplies;
(c) Construction and repairs of small structures
by local contractors;
(d) Construction of offices for the Feeder Roads
Technical Section;
(e) 210 man-months of technical assistance, including:
(1) about 150 man-months of engineering assistance
to establish the feeder roads division within the
Public Works Department; (2) 40 man-months for
training specialists in civil and mechanical
engineering; and (3) 20 man-months for an
economist/cost accounting specialist to set up a
cost accounting system, to monitor and analyze
project results, to prepare annual work programs
and proposals for a longer-term feeder road
strategy, and to develop a follow-up program; and
(f) Purchase of training materials.
.jI. PROJECT IMPLIMTATION
3.01. The project started promptly after the credit became effective. The
Intetministerial Feeder Road Committee was created in September 1979. The
head of the consultant team arrived in February 1980, and key engineering
staff of the Feeder Road Division were selected in the same month. However,
the nomination of a counterpart accountant was considerably delayed, and a
counterpart economist was not identified until after the departure of the
technical assistance team.   The first group of equipment operators and
mechanics was recruited and trained starting in April 1980. The training
program was prepared and implemented by the consultants under the ongoing
Third Highway Project.



3.02. Project start-up was slowed mainly by delays in the procurement and
delivery of equipment. Consequently, road construction did not begin until
October 1980. A call for bids on equipment had been issued in June 1979,
but due to cumbersome administrative procedures, the contract was not
approved until February 1980.  Delivery was further delayed by threo months
over the contractual period.  Thus, the equipment which had been expected to
arrive in January 1980 was not actually received until July 1980. Project
start-up was also delayed by sporadic strikes among the work force resulting
from undue delays in the payment of wages to temporary workers.
3.03. The project continued to experience delays during implementation, due
to low output during the initial training period, lack of flexibility in the
equipment fleet, and frequent breakdowns of equipment.   The project was
originally expected to close on June 30, 1984, but the closing date was
extended twice and the project actually closed on June 30, 1986.  The Credit
was fully disbursed on December 31, 1986.
3.04.  The Interministerial Committee met in June 1980 to select the roads
for the first year program. The following roads were selected:
Say-Kobadie (60 kms)              Brigade 1 ("Heavy')
Margou-Koygolo (58 kms)           Brigade 2 ("Heavy")
Mirriah-Dogo (30 kms)             Brigade 3 ("Light")
Korgom-Matameye (28 kms)          Brigade 3 ("Light")
3.05.  Based on the expected output of 6.87 kmimonth for the heavy brigades
and 6.6 km/month for the light brigade, it was expected that this program
would be completed by the end of 1981. However, by that date actual output
was only 115 km or about 65Z of the target. In addition to the causes of
delay noted above (poor equipment performance and occasional strikes by
workers),  this  delay was  due to unexpectedly  long material  transport
distances, the construction of a 17 km extension of one-road which was not
in the original program, and to changes in the agreed design standards for
some roads.
3.06.   Roads with relatively low traffic were intended to be built with
little or no embankment, in accordance with construction techniques practiced
under similar climatic, topographical and soil conditions.  However, in May
'981,  following construction of  the first such  roads,  the Government
requested IDA to approve construction of higher standard roads in low lying
areas in order to ensure all- weather access and to reduce future maintenance
costs. The adoption of higher standards would imply higher unit costs as
well as a greater use of equipment.   After carefully studying these
implications, the Government proposed and IDA approved a revised program with
the construction target reduced from 1000 km to 800 km.
3.07.  The second phase of the program was approved by the Interministerial
Conmittee in December 1981.  It included the following roadss



-6-
Kollo-Koure-Dantiandou (91 kms)         Brigade 1
KQygolo-Yeda-Baleyara (41 kms)          Brigade 2
Bonkoukou-Chical (35 kms)               Brigade 2
Banda-Wacha-Gouchi (84 kms)             Brigade 3
Normally, this program should have been completed in about a year. However,
due to the delays experienced in completing the first phase program, the
second phase did not get started until the second quarter of 1982. A year
later, none of the brigades had completed its part of the second phase
program.
3.08. Program output was estimated at appraisal to average 240 km per year.
In October 1983, a supervision mission reported completion of about 376 km,
well below appraisal forecasts. On December 31, 1983, when the project was
expected to be completed, cumulative progress was as followst
Brigade 1: 287 kms (80X of target)
Brigade 2: 232 kms (66X of target)
Brigade 3: 114 kms (56Z of target)
The relatively better performance of Brigade 1 is related to terrain
conditions in the region where it was working; a lateritic plateau requiring
little in the way of earthworks and materials transport. Poor cohesion of
the natural soils combined with long transport distances explain the
relatively poorer performance of Brigades 2 and 3.  All of the brigades
suffered from poor performance of equipment and of the equipment maintenance
team. In fact, the "light' brigade equipped with SM8 trucks lost half of its
transport capacity. The Volvo loaders recorded an average of 182 days out of
service during 1983. Equipment problems became such a serious constraint
that the head of the technical assistance team, a road engineer, had to be
replaced by a mechanical engineer. Problems due to delays in wage payments
were resolved with the creation of a project account in May 1981.
3.09. The supervision mission of OctoberlNovember 1983 concluded that the
remaining available funds would be sufficient to complete between 650 and
750 kmi. of roads.  In other respects, the project was viewed as successful
due to excellent collaboration between the consultants, their counterparts,
and the Government. A cost accounting system had been developed and applied,
and control had been good throughout in terms of both resource management and
engineering practice. The mission also concluded that tne costs of the lower
standard roads were no less than those of the higher standard, because
although lower quantities were involved, the lower capacity equipment of the
light brigades resulted in higher unit costs.
3.10. A third phase program was agreed by the Interministerial Committee in
May 1983. It included the following roads:
Badeguichiri-Laba (84 kms)
Gabi-Maraka (21 km)
Baga-Tamaske (45 km)
Tchadaoua-Gazaoua (72 km)



-7-
This phase, which was completed in December 1986, was entirely executed by
Nigerien staff.  The corsultant team left in April 1984 and from then on
supervision was provided by the national staff.   The light brigade was
gradually converted to the same characteristics as the heavy brigades.
Productivity levels were maintained but not improved, mainly due to
continuing difficulties with the equipment. These problems worsened as the
equipment became older and when, after 1985, restrictions were placed on
equipment maintenance expenditures preventing to use private services.
3.11.  A supervision mission in October 1984 concluded that the pace of
production could be significantly increased if the equipment fleet were more
efficient  and. flexible.   The mission  recommended that the Credit be
restructured under the Special Action Program, to reduce the Nigerien
contribution from 23Z to 5% of costs net or taxes, to enable procurement of
the needed equipment within the approved 1984-85 budget. The mission also
recommended establishing a revolviing fund to facilitate IDA contributions to
the costs of spare parts and local labor.
3.12. In December 1984 the Special Action Program for Niger was approved.
IDA's share of project financing was increased from 77% to 95%, including an
increase from 25% to 95% in IDA's share of local labor costs. This change
reduced the Government's contribution to t;te project as a whole from 21% to
18% of costs net of taxes.   The Special Action Program also included
establishment of a Speclal Account (revolving fund) for the project. The
Credit Agreement was amended accordingly on January 18, 1985.
3.13. Project implementation improved from January 1985 as a result of these
measures.  However, a significant increase in productivity could only be
achieved when additional and replacement equipment, procurod under the
project but not delivered until the end of 1986, became operational. At
project completion in June 1986, some 650 km of feeder roads and about 150
km of connecting side roads had been completed.
Equipment Performance
3.14. Equipment performance was far from satisfactory. Over the course of
the project, 1,237 workiag days were lost due to equipment breakdowns. This
does not include time lost due to shorter interruptions in service or to
breakdowns among the transport vehicles.  Three types of equipment are worth
more particular mention:
(a) The Volvo loaders which alone were responsible for the loss of 234
working days. These were scrapped in 1983 after only three years
of service.
(b) The eight Land Rovers had an average lifetime of less than two
years.
(c)  The SM8 trucks were proven too light and performed poorly.
3.15.  The primary cause of this situation was a poor initial choice of
equipment.  However, equipment performance is als8  linked to the quality of



maintenance. Improvement in the equipment maintenance system continues to
be one of the main concerns of project staff.
Proiect Costs
3.16. Table 1 shows costs foreseen at appraisal and actual costs. The total
cost (evaluated in local currency) was about 52% higher than appraisal
forecasts. The local contribution was 73% higher than expected, including
financing of 40% of the cost overrun.   The remainder was covered by the
increase in the dollar exchange rate over the project period.
3.17. Equipment expenditures were 902 higher than forecast. Both the raising
of design standards and the weaknesses found in certain categories of
equipment (para. 3.15) made it necessary to acquire additional equipment.
In addition, two contracts for a total of 409 million FCFA were awarded in
1985 for the purchase of new equipment, to be used for the second rural roads
program; 50% of this amount was charged to the first project. Finally, 85Z
of the equipment purchase contracts included taxes, while at appraisal it was
expected that these purchases would be exempted from tax.
3.18. Consumption of fuel, lubricants and spare parts cost more than twice
as much as predicted. The indirect taxes included in the price of these
goods and the declining purchasing power of the CFA franc partially account
for this increase.
3.19. Personnel costs exceeded the forecasts by 60%. This is mainly due to
the extended life of the project (seven years instead of four). An estimate
based on data from the last four years of the project indicates that overhead
costs (salaries of headquarters staff) represent 11% of the total.
3.20. The cost of technical assistance was more than twice what had been
expected. The initial contract amount, which was already 40% higher than
foreseen at appraisal, was increased three times to take into account 80
man-months of additional assistance and to include price adjustments.
Technical assistance costs represented 232 of project costs.
Unit Construction Costs
3.21. Table 2 indicates the estimated unit construction costs and the actual
costs for each road. Actual costs have been adjusted to 1978 prices assuming
an average annual inflation rate of 8% over the project period. Estimated
costs have been adjusted to take account of taxes, which are assumed to
represent 30% of the with-tax cost. Four roads show important variations
between estimated and actual costs: Mirriah-Dogo and Korgom-Matameye, which
had  actual   costs   significantly  higher  than  the   forecasts,   and
Badeguichiri-Laba and Gabi-Maraka, whose costs were less than forecast.
3.22. For Mirriah-Dogo, the initial design called for a gravel thickness of
14 cm, while the work accomplished had a thickness of 23 cm. In addition,
work was frequently held up due to equipment breakdowns.   Consequently,
completion of this road took 11 months instead of the 3 months originally
planned.



-9-
3.23. The cost savings achieved on Badaguichiri-Laba are partly due to the
nature of the terrain. Almost all of this road lies on & lateritic plateau
where earthworks are almost unnecessary and transport distances are rarely
more than 1 km.  On Gabi-Maraka, it was possible to rehabilitate a 9 km
existing track, thus achieving substantial savings on brush clearing and
earthworks.
Disbursement of Credit 886-NIR
3.24.  Table 3 shows projected and actual disbursements over the project
period. In the first year, disbursements were only half of projections due
to the start-up delays.   In the following two years, disbursements were
approximately the same as projections (1072 in 1981 and 100l in 1982).
During 1983 and 1984, however, disbursements were approximately 15Z less than
projected, principally due to the rapid increase in dollar exchange rates.
Thus, in December 1984, 202 of the credit remained undisbursed. The credit
was fully disbursed at the end of December 1986.
3.25. Lengthy disbursement procedures initially posed a cash flow problem
for the government and consequently for the small contractors and wage
earners participating in the project. The opening of a special account in
1985 to serve as a revolving fund greatly eased this situation.   This
innovation made it possible for the government to reduce payment delays by
45 days.
Disbursement of Local Funds
3.26. The project accounts for counterpart funds from the national budget,
the National Investment Fund, and the later Investment Budget, were regularly
replenished by government. However, during the first two project years, only
a small part of the amount allocate? by government was effectively utilized
(22 in 1980 and 13.52 in 1981). Performance improved considerably in the
next year, when 702 of the available funds were used. From 1983 on, local
funds made available for the project were fully utilized.
3.27. Disbursement procedures for local funds were very cumbersome. Some
modifications were introduced over the life of the project to try to speed
up disbursements. For example, after 1980 wage payments to brigade workers
did not have to be approved by the departmental prefect. The main innovation
was the opening in May 1981 of a special account into which IDA disbursements
were directly deposited. Payments could be made from this account within two
weeks, whereas following the normal procedures, payments could take from one
to three months.   However, this arrangement has not entirely solved all
problems relating to the disbursement cf local funds, since use of the
deposit account does not fully substitute for local procedures.
Consultant Performance
3.28. The consultant team was present for a total of 51 calendar months,
from February 1980 to April 1984. A total of 270 man-months of technical
assistance was provided. The objectives of these services were as follows:



- 10 -
*    to establish a feeder roads service within DTP;
*    to procure the equipment and supplies needed for
the project;
*    to prepare bid documents for works to be executed by
contractors;
*    to carry out a four-year program of feeder road
construction covering approximLtely 1000 km;
*    to conduct a staff training program;
*    to assist DTP in preparing and justifying each
annual work program;
*    to assist DTP in monitoring and evaluating project
results; and
*    to prepare a long-term strategy for feeder road
Improvement and maintenance.
With respect to the organization, execution, and reporting of the project,
the consultants performed very well. However, their performance in the area
of training was not satisfactory. For example, of 23 months spent in Niger
by the training expert in mechanics, only 3 months were spent actually
training counterpart staff. Training was also inhibited by the government's
difficulties in finding suitable counterpart staff. However, the main reason
for poor performance was the consultant's neglect of training in favor of
project execution.   This may be partly explained by pressure from the
administration to see concrete results. Training was so poor that after -he
consultant left some services became inactive, no longer maintaining their
records or preparing regular reports.
Supplier Performance
3.29. Supplier performance was generally satisfactory, with respect both to
the quality of service and delivery times. However, two suppliers went
bankrupt and were unable to honor their contracts. One of these was a small
contractor selected to construct minor works on the Say-Kobadie road, and the
other was a firm specializing in the supply of spare parts and vehicles. The
corresponding contracts were cancelled with amounts totalling 11,863,800 CFA
francs outstanding.
IV. ECONOMIC REEVALUATION
4.01.   A study of the short-term socio-economic impact of the five roads
completed by 1983 was carried out in 1984 by the consultants as part of their
final report. The study used actual construction costs and maintenance costs
estimated on the basis of the cost accounting data collected during project
implementation.    Expected  benefits  were  calculated  according  to  the
consultant's original project evaluation methodology and included both
vehicle user cost savings and value added in agricultural production.
4.02. Construction costs ranged from US$10,100 to US$14,150 per kilometer
net of taxes. The variation in costs was due to variations in terrain and
in site organization rather than to the use of different design standards.



- 11 -
Following the appraisal methodology, the consultants excluded one-third of
the project technical assistance costs from the economic evaluation of the
completed roads.
4.03.   Traffic on the improved roads, as measured by actual traffic counts,
exceeded the volumes predicted in the pre-project study but remained at
relatively low levels (less than 10 vehicles per day in most cases). Since
there were no pre-project traffic data, it was not possible to deiermine
whether the expected shifts in vehicle types had taken place.  Using the
appraisal estimates of pre-project traffic, and assuming that the shift did
taka place, the consultants concluded that traffic had grown by about 201 per
year on the newly opened roads and that user cost savings accounted for more
than half the benefits on all but one road.  Traffic consisted mainly of
public passenger vehicles, commercial and administrative vehicles, and trucks
carrying firewood.
4.04.  The calculation of benefits due to increase in net agricultural value
added was questionable because of the poor quality of available agricultural
data. The consultants forecast a linear growth of production in line with
trends during the late seventies, which would generate an increasing
marketable surplus in the project areas.   However, in most cases the
anticipated increase in net value added proved relatively unimportant in the
calculation of rates of return. The consultants calculated rates of return
ranging from 72 to 351, assuming a future traffic growth rate of 5Z per year.
4.05.    Near the end of the project, in 1987, staff of the Feeder Roads
Division, with short-term support from the consultants, conducted traffic
counts and field studies in the area of influence of the 11 project roads,
including two which were still under construction.   They reached the
following conclusionss
(a) The influence area of the roads, originally assumed to extend for
5 kms to each side, was actually much larger. In fact, the roads
provided improved access to several communities not actually
located on the roads, but linked to them by unimproved tracks. It
appeared that the road improvements provided sufficient incentive
for transporters to use these tracks and that villagers were
prepared to travel up to 15 kms. on foot or by animal transport in
order to reach the improved roads.
(b) Improved roads did not appear to induce significant long-distance
migration. However, the population in the districts served by the
roads tended to become more concentrated in the villages and the
area close to the roads.
(c) Agricultural production in the influence area of the roads did not
increase as expected. This was attributed to the failure of the
rural development projects, which were supposed to have
significantly increased yields through the application of improved
technology (use of fertilizer) and the use of new plant varieties.
Most farmers failed to adopt the new methods, and consequently
agricultural production in the impact zones barely kept pace with



- 12 -
population incroase.   Drought was also seen as a contributing
factor to poor agricultural performance.
(d) Lack of pro-project data made it impossible to assess possible
changes in patterns of service utilization. However, the improved
roads served over fifty local markets with an estimated total
volume of sales representing about FCFA 70 million in tax revenues.
About 20 health centers and more than 50 schools were located in
the project influence areas. Services and supplies furnished to
these facilities accounted for a significant share of traffic on
the roads.
(e) To complement the traffic counts regularly carried out by the Road
Management Bureau (BGR) on the improved roads, Feeder Road Division
staff conducted an origin-destination survey of traffic on five
roads (Say-Kobadie, Gazaoua-Tchadaoua, Margou-Baleyara, Mirriah-
Dogo, and Bande-Wacha-Gouchi). According to the 1986 BGR counts,
traffic averaged 22 vehicles per day on the rural roads, 302 more
than the appraisal forecasts. Heavy truck traffic was more than
three times higher than predicted.   The most frequently found
vehicle types were light trucks and vans, representing two-thirds
of total traffic.   These vehicles were mainly dedicated to
passenger transport with small amounts of accompanied baggage.
Passenger load factors were generally in excess of the authorized
caracity.
(f) Private cars represented 182 of total traffic. Such traffic was
generally linked to development project activities and social
services. Heavy trucks accounted for 16Z of traffic and generally
transported foodgrains (millet, sorghum, and cowpeas). However,
in the more wooded regions (Say-Kobadie, Kollo-Koure), truck
transport of firewood was even more important than food. More than
60Z of the trucks counted on Say-Kobadie were transporting
firewood. Average truck load factors were close to 902.
(g) Throughout the project area, transport demand continues to exceed
supply. Animal-drawn carts represent an important share of road
traffic (up to 502 on some roads) to which no benefits are
attributed in the economic analysis. The very high load factors
and the margins which transporters can charge over their actual
costs indicate that supply is still constrained, mainly by the
difficulty of purchasing new vehicles and securing spare parts.
(h) The post-project evaluation revealed that the improved roads, which
originally served the function of rural feeder roads, have become
significant links in the regional and even the national road
network.   For example, the rural road from Gabi to Maraka, an
extension of RN 18, offers the local population a direct link to
Nigeria. Similarly, the road from Margou to Baleyara provides the
eastern part of Niamey Department with direct access to the 7enin
frontier.



- 13 -
4.06.   The economic evaluation methodology adopted by the consultants who
prepared the project relied heavily on benefits to be derived from increased
agricultural production as a result of the rural development projects planned
for the road impact zones. Agricuiltural value added was expected to account
for 85% of the benefits. Passenger traffic was forecast, based on a gravity
model, to grow at about 6.5% per year. The projection of user cost savings
for freight traffic was also derived from the expected increase in
agricultural production. This conceptual error (double counting of benefits)
caused Bank staff to discard the consultant's methodology at appraisal,
relying instead on benefits detived from user cost savings on non-
agricultural traffic and from agricultural losses avoided. However, staff
of the Feeder Roads Division were not informed of this change, and they
continued to apply the consultant's methodology for rural road evaluation.
4.07. Ten years later, however, it became apparent that these assumptions
were no longer valid. With few exceptions, the rural development projects
did not achieve their objectives. The production of cash crops (groundnuts,
cotton) has declined considerably. In contrast, some activities which were
not even considered ten years ago have shown remarkable progress,
particularly the cultivation of off-season crops (cultures de contre-saison).
Production of such crops, which are perishable and consequently transport-
sensitive, is probably closely related to reliable road transport.
4.08.   The economic re-evaluation is based on the same costs  and benefits
used at appraisal, with one exception. The appraisal assumed that the roads
(to be constructed to a light design standard) would have no residual value
after ten years.  The re-evaluation considers .hat, due to the implementation
of higher design standards, the roads will have a residual value amounting
to 301 of construction costs at the end of the evaluation period.   The
calculation of benefits due to transport of agricultura'. freight is based on
the same crops (foodgrains) considered in the appraisal, without regard to
additional benefits that may have been generated by growth in production of
off-season crops or by harvesting of firewood. These benefits are included
in the growth of non-agricultural traific.
4.09.   Traffic data used in the economic re-evaluation were furnished by
BGR for all but two roads (Gazaoua-Tchadaoua and Gabi-Maraka).   On these
roads, the Feeder Roads Division organized 3-day counts with support from
BGR and the local road maintenance services.  Future non-agricultural traffic
growth is forecast at 7% per year, corresponding to historical growth in the
vehicle fleet. This assumption is believed tc be fairly conservative, since
a comparison of 1986 data on the rural roads for which traffic was counted
in 1983 indicates an average annual growth rate of more than 20% in the years
imediately following the opening of the roads.  Agricultural traffic is
assumed not to grow in the future.
4.10.   Vehicle user costs were taken from the interim report of the ongoing
National Transport Plan Study. Since this study did not provide unit costs
for 4-wheel drive vehicles, the most common vehicle type on rural roads,
these costs were estimated by applying corrective factors to the components
of unit costs for ordinary light trucks. Costs and benefits are given in
constant 1986 eollars using an 8% inflation rate.

4.11.   Table 4 shows the internal rate of return calculated for each road.
Only two roads have rates of return of less than 1OZ, both in Tahoua
Department. In most cases the rates of return are higher than the appraisal
estimate. Two roads, Margou-Baleyara and Mirriah-Dogo have rates of return
of over 30%, considerably higher than expected. The rate of return for the
total program is re-evaluated at 24Z, compared to 212 anticipated at
appraisal.
4.12.   The structure of benefits is also significantly different from that
expected during project  preparation.   Agricultural traffic,  which was
expected to account for well over half of the benefits, is estimated to
account for only about 1OZ of the actual benefits.  In contrast, user cost
savings  for non-agricultural  traffic,  which were  not  expected  to be
significant, actually represent almost all of the benefits. The increase in
user cost savings is due both to the higher than expected increase in traffic
(302 more than forecast) and to a major increase in unit vehicle operating
costs over the project period (up to double the 1978 value in real terms).
Part of the increase in user cost savings is due to an unanticipated shift
in vehicle types used for passenger transport; on improved roads, private
cars, vans and light trucks now substitute for the four-wheel drive vehicles
previously used for passenger transport.
4.13.     It may be noted that the most expensive rural roads are not
necessarily the least economic. ThLe roads with the highest rates of return
are those located in areas of high population density. Finally, the economic
viability of the northern roads, Badeguicheri-Laba and Bagga-Tamaske, may
have been underestimated in this analysis. Traffic on these roads, at the
time of the survey, was restricted by government controls on passenger
transport and by the poor condition of some sections where structures (to be
executed by local contractors) were not yet completed. Consequently, some
of the potential traffic may have been diverted to other roads.
V. BANK PERFORNANCE
5.01.     The project responded well to felt needs on the part of the
Government of Niger and the people of the project areas. It was executed
with reasonable dispatch by the implementing agency, while delays in project
execution were mainly due to central government actions beyond the agency's
control (delays in credit effectiveness, cumbersome procurement procedures,
and delays in making local funds available for wage payments). With two main
exceptions, the Government complied with the agreements made at negotiations.
The exceptions were (1) the strengthening of road design standards relative
to those agreed at appraisal, and (2) the funding of rural road maintenance
from the project budget. In both cases, the Bank agreed after discussions
with the Government to accept the Government's proposals. The Borrower has
no comment on Bank performance.
5.02.   The project was adequately supervised, with an average of two Bank
missions per year over the project period. Supervision missions averaged
two staff members and included engineers, economists, financial analysts,



- 15 -
sociologists,  and equipment experts.   Although there was  considerable
turnover in supervisory staff over the project period, continuity was good
and this did not present a problem for project implementation. Lessons drawn
from the successful establishment of a feeder roads division, the
implementation and use of a cost accounting system, the comparison of
construction methods involving varying degrees of labor and equipment, and
the socio-economic impact study, have since been -eflected in the design of
other Bank-financed feeder road projects.
5.03.   The Bani  failed to anticipate the rapid growth of traffic and its
changing composition on improved roads, particularly the increase in heavy
trucks. Consequently, the design standards agreed at appraisal were actually
too light. The Government recognized this problem and the Bank responded in
a positive way during project implementation. As a res-2lt. the feeder road
program was completed to standards capable of supporting current traffic
levels and the roads now represent a sustainable investment. One consequence
of this change was a shift in emphasis from labor-based methods suitable for
light construction to greater use of heavy equipment, increasing costs and
construction time, but also increasing the viability of the project.
5.04.    Government failure to comply with its agreements regarding the
separate funding of rural road maintenance was noted in supervision reports
and brought to the attention of Government authorities. However, given the
severe revenue constraints being experienced by the Government at the time,
Bank staff accepted Government proposals that, for a few years, the improved
roads should be maintained by the feeder road brigades using project funds.
The issue of adequate road maintenance funding arose at the same time in
connection with the Fourth Highway Project and was fully addressed under the
follow-on Transport Sector Credit, which includes a second rural roads
program.
5.05.     If Bank staff had accurately predicted the failure of rural
development programs in Niger, it is probable that this profitable investment
would never have been undertaken. The evidence of this project shows that
the relationship between access improvement and improved welfare for rural
people is more complex than has hitherto been assumed. Despite the projects'
failure to attain their agricultural objectives, there is a large and
apparently still unsatisfied demand for transport in densely populated rural
areas.  This means either that people are producing and selling products
other than those on which the rural development programs have been based
(off-season crops, firewood, fish and dairy products), or else that they are
finding wage employment or other sources of nonfarm income (e.g. smuggling).
Regardless of the nature of income-generating activities, road access removes
a critical constraint on the mobility of labor and capital and the
functioning of rural markets.
5.06.   An issue that has only recently come to the attention of Bank staff
is the likely sustainability of development initiatives in fragile ecological
settings.   As a Sahelian country, Niger is vulnerable to drought sand
desertification following upon excessive conceutrations of population. ro
the extent that rural roads may accelerate the process of deforestation And
encourage increased exploitation of the land, they may have a negative



- 16 -
environmental impact in the long run.  On the other hand, by promoting a
transition to nonfarm employment and by providing access to health,
education, and extension services, rural roads may actually facilitate the
development of a more sustainable lifestyle for rural people in the long run.
Specific attention should be paid to this issue in the socio-economic impact
research to be carried out by the Feeder Road Division under the Transport
Sector Credit.
VI. CONCLUSIONS
6.01.    The immediate objectives of the project (execution of the road
program and institutional strengthening) have been achieved. However, due
to the agreed changes in design standards, the total length completed was
only 70% of the original target. Furthermore, brigade output never reached
the rates foreseen in the appraisal report. Construction by force account
proved satisfactory with marginal costs less than those of construction by
contract.   In many regions it can be seen that project roads do not
deteriorate as fast as those executed by contractors.   Finally,  this
procedure was based on the local recruitment of unskilled labor, allowing
the beneficiaries of the project to participate in project execution.
6.02.   The available evidence seems to indicate that the project has made
an important contribution to the process of rural develc.-ment in Niger, even
though this came about in ways that were not anticipated at the beginning of
the project. The sustainability of this contribution critically depends upon
the continuing commitment of the Government to provide regular routine
maintenance and to ensure that periodic maintenance takes place as needed.
The system of road management installed under the Fourth Highway Project and
supported under the Transport Sector Credit makes it seem likely that this
objective can be achieved, unless limited by a lack of funds in the future.
6.03.      In  a broader  sense,  the  sustainability of  this  development
intervention depends on achieving and maintaining a balance between the needs
of the ever-increasing project area population and the productive capacity
of the physical environment. This implies the development of a more complex
economy in rural areas, based on more specialized production activities and
on increasing interdependence and exchange. It requires the dissemination
of knowledge and communication of concerns among rural residents, the
development of more complex forms of social organization, and the
establishment of greater ties between urban and rural areas. Transport will
continue to play a critical part in this process of rural development, and
investments to reduce the costs of transport must be an essential part of any
strategy to improve the standard of living for Niger's rural poor.

Economic Evaluation Methodolorv
Actual construction costs %er kilometer, which include taxes, were
multiplied by 0.7 to obtain economic costs. All costs were assumed to have
been incurred in the year of completion and were adjusted to constant 1986
CFAF using an assumed annual inflation rate of 8%.
Maintenance costs per kilometer were based on cost accounting data
from the first (1983-1985) maintenance program carried out on rural roads.
Salvage value was estimated to be 30% of economic construction
costs.
User cost savings were calculated as followst
Passenter transport. It is assumed that light vehicle (private car
and van) traffic will grow at 72 per year from the levels measured in 1985-
86.
To calculate the costs of passenger transport without the improved
road, the number of passengers transported is calculated on the assumption
that vans have an average capacity of 20 passengers and an average load
factor of 80%, while private cars have an average capacity of 5 and an
average load factor of 60%. Thus each van corresponds to 16 passengers and
uasn car to 3 passengers. It is assumed that without the project, the same
amount of passenger transport would have been provided by 4-wheel-drive
vehicles with a capacity of 17 passengers and an average load factor of 601
or 10 passengers.
The 1986 unit vehicle operating cost for both cars and vans on
impr *ed rural roads is about 133 CFAFIvehicle-kilometer. The VOC for a 4-
wheel-drive vehicle operated on an unimproved track is 370 CFAF/veh-km.
Freitht transport. The number of trucks transporting foodgrains
is calculated by subtracting an assumed amount of local consumption (220
kg/person of millet and sorghum and 24 kg/person of cowpeas) from estimated
total production in the influence zone of each road. It is assumed that the
remainder is trarsported on the road. Estimated production is based on data



- 21 -
ANNEX
Page 2 of 3
from the sampJe villages studied for this report, and represents an average
of production  over  the  last  four years.    It  is  assumed  that  this
commercialized surplus will not change in the future (i.e., that production
will grow just enough to meet increasing demand for local consumption).
Millet and sorghum are assumed to be transported by medium (12-
ton) trucks with an 802 load factor following the project, while the same
amount is assumed to be transported by light (3.5-4 ton) trucks with a 601
load factor in the without-project case. Cowpeas continue to be transported
using light trucks, but the load factor is assumed to increase from 601 to
801.
Actual traffic counts show a number of trucks on the road that
substantially exceeds the number that would be needed to transport the
assumed  agricultural surplus.    It  is  assumed  that  these  trucks  are
transporting cash crops and consumer goods and that this traffic will grow
at 7% per year. It is further assumed that 251 more such trucks would be
needed to transport an equal volume of goods in the without-project case, due
to lower load factors.
Freight vehicle operating costs are shown below for improved and
unimproved rural roads (in CFAFtvehicle-km).
