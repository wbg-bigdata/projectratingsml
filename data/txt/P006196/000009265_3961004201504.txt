MEMORANDUM AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT
OF THIE IN4TERNATIONAL DEVELOPMENT ASSOCIATION
TO TIHE EXECUTIVE DIRECTMRS
ON A PROPOSED CREDIT TO THE REPUBLJC OF BOLIVIA
FOR AN INTEGRATED CHILD DEVELOPMIN PROJECT
1.    I submit for your approval the following memorandum and recommendation on a proposed
development credit to Bolivia for SDR 35,800,000, the equivalent of US$50.7 million, on standard
International Development Association (IDA) terms with a maturity of 40 years. The credit would
help finance an Integrated Child Development Project to enhance the welfare of poor children and
women in the nation's 34 largest urban areas.
2.    Background. The economic policy, adopted by the Government of Bolivia (GOB) in 1985,
has been highly successful in stabilizing the economy and in reducing internal and external imbalances.
As a result of the adjustment program, the public sector deficit was lowered and inflation was brought
under control. For the first time in neariy a decade, the economy attained a positive GDP growth rate
of 2.6 percent in 1987, and continuous prudent macroeconomic *mgement permitted the recovery
to be sustained with steady annual GDP growth of 2.7 percent on average through 1990. During 1991
and 1992, the economic situation continued to improve, with GDP growth of 4.1 percent and 3.8
percen, respectively. Despite good economic management in recent years, Bolivia faces a difficult
set of development challenges. Per capita GNP of US$652 (1991) is among the lowest in Latin
America and the economic situation remains fragile. Moreover, macroeconomic adjustments have not
been accompanied by significant reductions in poverty or improvements in social indicators.
Distribution of the economic and social benefits of growth remans highly skewed. Data from the
1990 Integrated Household Survey (EIH) indicate that the overall incidence of urban poverty is
approximately 55 percent, and rises to 70 percent in certain cities. Preliminary data from the 1992
census suggest that severe poverty remains pervasive.
3.    Women and Young Cldren at Risk. Women and young children are disproportionately
represented among the poor and face especially difficult circumstances. Female illiteay rates are
twice those of males. Women face discriminator, hiring and wage practices and have virtually no
access to credit. They also are restricted legally from some productive activities. With their increased
migration to cities, women have assumed a major role in the labor force, representing almost one-half
of all workers, albeit still heavily concentrated in the informal sector. While most women are forced
to work to help support :heir families, social norms dictate that they remain the principal caretakers
of their children. Given limited access to day-care, many women must either leave their children
home aknie or opt for relatively low paying jobs where their children can accompany them. A
woman's risk of morbidity and premature death is exceptionally high. It is closely linked both to high
fertlity, with a total fertility rate of 4.8 and, relatedly, a modem contrueptive prevalence rate of only
18 percent, and to extremely limited utilizaton of key health services. Half of all women receive no
prenatal care and only about 40 percent deliver in health facilities. It is esfimated that one in ten
women dies of pregnancy-related causes.
4.    Infamts and young children also are extrUmely vulnerable to illness and death. Ihe national
infant mortality rate is estimated to be between 96 and 102 per 1,000 live births, among the highest
in Latin America. Coverage of key preventive health services, including iniz aons and periodic
health and nutrition surveillance, is exceptionally low. Malnutition is pervasive. Most recent data
indicate dtat 13 percent of children under age three are underweight, and 38 percent are stunted, or
short for their age, reflecting chronic malnutrition. Much of this mntritional problem appears to occur
after the first six months of age, coinciding with the weaning period.

S.    Government Sectoral Policy. Although the GOB long has espousd its commitment to social
development, over the past few decades it consistendy failed to ensure that the requisite institutional
base was in place. and that sufficient financial resources were allocated to design and deliver
sustaiLtable social programs. Its 1971 initiative to improve the social welfare of children and the
elderly, via creation of an autonomous social assistance agency, the Juwa Nacional de Desarmllo
Social (JNSDS), had an extremely limited impact. Recognizing the need to better target fiscal social
spending to the most vulnerable subgroups, i.e., ints, young children and women, and the serious
institutional constraints to doing so, in the late 1980s the GOB initiated a series of measures to
improve the technical and administratve capacity of key social agencies. Institdonalization of the
Social Investment Fund (SIF), building on the successful Emergency Social Fund experience, and
commencement of an education sector reform effort have been positive steps in this direccion. Ihe
creation in 1989 of the National Council of Social Policy (CONAPSO), and subsequently, in 1991,
of its technical unit, the Social Policy Analysis Unit (UDAPSO), also have contributed toward building
the GOB's capacity to formulate and evaluate social policy. Another promising measure to enhant
institutional capacity was the launching in 1989 of a major restructuring of JNSDS, including: (a)
modernization of its organizational structure and strueamlinig of Its personnel complement; institution
of improved financial and administnative wontrol systems, and policies to improve the quality and
distribution of personnel; and (b) a programmatic shift to community-based preventive programs,
concomitant with a diminution in its own direct role in the management of service delivery facilities.
6.    Subsequently, a Minor's Law (CSddgo del Menor) was adopted in 1992 which provides the
legal framework for INSDS's modemization, redefining its operational structure, and mandating that
it assume a leadership role in guiding social policy formulation and programming, under the new name
of the Organismo Nacional del Menor, 7,dujer y Fawlla-ONAMFA (National Agency far Children,
Women and the Family). ONAMFA's moderization process is well underway. Its uldmate success
depends largely on its ability to attract and retain well-qualified managerial and technical staff. An
important basis for this now exists with ONAMFA's recent acceptance int the new Civil Service
Reform Program (CSRP)-one of the first public agencies to meet the demanding organizational
prerequisites. Further strengthening of ONAMFA's administrative and financial capacity at the
national and regional levels is essenial to enable it to filfill its crucial mandate.
7.    The GOB's current socia policy is articlated in its Social Strategy (Estrategla Social
Bolviaa) of September 1991. This policy underscores the need to redress the historic social debt
by improving the quality of life of the most vulnerable population, thus attaining a more equitable
distributon of the benefits of economic growth. To these ends, a multi-pronged, long-term stategy
is promulgated, focusing on human capital development. The strategy assigns high priority to:
increasing social sector investments, strengthening the information base for social policy decision-
making, and increasing the efficiency of domestic and exteral resource use through select sectoral
reforms, better targeting of policies and programs, and improved coordination of activities of agencies
involved in the delivery of social services, including NGOs. A key instrument for attaining social
policy objectives is the Tea-Year Action Plan for Children and Women (Plan Decenal), elaborated
by an int-ministerial and    ciplinary     The Plan defies precise targets for enhancing the
status of children and women by the Year 2000, delineates specific regional activities that must be
undertaken to achieve them, and establishes itmediate goals for 1995 to measure progress.
Recommended programs and projects span the areas of health and nutrition, education, environmental
health, children in difficult circumstances, and women. Among the Plans priority programs to
address the problems confronting high risk children under six years of age is the Proyecto Integral
de Desarrol Ifandl-PMDI (Integrated Child Development Project).
8.    Food aid has become an integral part of Boliia's social programs, the major sources of which
are the United States, the World Food Programme, and the European Community. According to GOB
esmates, the value of this eten  assistance exceeds total annual health expenditures and is triple



3-
the Treasury's annual budgetary support to the Ministry of Social Assistance and Public Health
(MPSSP). Despite such substantial aid, valued in 1992 alone at US$116 million, both the extent of
malnutriton and Its distribution by degrees have remained fairly constant In recent years. This
strongly suggests Inadeqate targedng to highest risk groups.
9.    Project Objectves and Target Pbpulation. The proposed project seeks to contribute toward
poverty alleviadon and human capital development objectives by supporting the Inidation of the PIDI
in the 34 largs urban areas, with populados over 10,000, and establishing a basis for development
of long-tenr policies and programs to provide early childhood development services, including in rural
areas. The specific objectives are to: (a) Improve children's readines to succeed in school and
beyond by facilitating their physical, emotional, social and cognitive development; (b) enbance the
status of women by increasing their employment opporunities, and expanding their knowledge of
education, health and nutrition; and (c) increase community and private sector participation in the
social development process. An associated objective of the project is to assist the GOB to strengthen
its capacity to formulate and evaluate social policy. The principal beneficiaries of proposed project-
supported interventions would be some 200,000 children between 6 months and 6 years of age,
representing more than half of all vulnerable children in these age groups living in these urban areas.
10. Project Description. The Sector Policy Development and Management Strengthening
component (3 percent of total costs) would enhance the public sector's capacity to formulate and
implement social policy by supporting: (a) studies and technical assistance to permit the broadening
of policy foundations in the areas of food security and nutrition, refinement of measures of chLd
development, and extension of integrated child development services to rural areas, including finacing
for pilot projects; and (b) consolidation of ONAMFA's recent modernizaon efforts and its
incorporation into the CSRP. Funding would be provided for technical assistance, incremental salaries
for 33 key ONAMA positions to be brought under the CSRP, computer and office equipment, and
training. The Sevice Delvery Support component (95 percent of total costs) would support the
delivery of integrated child development services to poor children 6 months to 6 years of age by
placing in operation over the project life some 8,600 day-wcare centers. Each center would provide
non-formal, home-base care to about 15 children by two to three caregivers (depending on the age-
mix of the children) who would be selected from the community. Caregivers would receive a monthly
stipend for their services (roughly equivalent to a minimum salary) and benefilciaries would contribute
a monthly user charge. Communities to participate in the project would be selected on the basis of
poverty maps, and the children within them on the basis of disdnc household socioeconomic crtria,
with highest priority assigned to malnourished chfldren. The component specifically would: (a)
fmrther develop and strengthen the project's operational structure at the ceral and regional levels;
(b) refine mechanisms for targetng beneficiaries and selecting caregivers; (c) provide inial and in-
service training to caregivers to respond to early education, nutrition and health service needs of tiLe
children; (d) promote the formation and build the capacity of parents' associations to assist in project
administration; (e) finance, via a mixed grant4oan, the rehabiliation of those caregivers' homes which
are to serve as day-care sites; (f) directy provide children with nutrition supplementation and a basic
package of itegrated early education services and, through cooperative agreements with local (public
or private) referral health centers, ensure their access to key preventive and curative health services;
and (g) for pregnant women who are caregivers or have children participating in the project, secure
preferential user fees for maternity care, family planning education and services, and health and
nutrition services, thus increasing their access. To these ends, the proposed project would finance
furniture, equipment and supplies for the day-care centers; home rehabilitation; technical assistance;
caregivers' stipends, training and supervision; vehicles, equipment and supplies for project
administration; a health fund to help finance diagnostic and treatment services for malnourished
children from exremely poor families; food commodities (not IDA financed); and salaries of
incremental positions for national and regional project teams. The Monitoring and Evaluation
component (2 percent of total costs) would support close project performance monitoring and impact



-4 -
evaluation by developing and implementing: (a) a management information system to monitor:
timeliness in achieving programmed levels of inputs and, thus, in attaining ptoject coverage targets;
compliance with technical and operational norms, thus ensuring the quality of services delivered; and
the overall soundness of project adminision and financing; and (u) an impact evaluation system,
based on periodic data generated from the Integrated Household Survey (Ef) and special modules
on health, nutrition and child development status to be added to it, as well as the conduct of special
longitudinal studies and sociological surveys. The project would finance requisite technical assistance
and computers and equipment for the operation of these systems. Costs related to the salaries of
positions under the CSRP, caregivers' stipends, the health fund, and salaries of incremental positions
of national and regional project teams would be financed by IDA on a declining basis. An advance
from the Project Preparation Facility (PPF) of US$750,000 was approved by IDA on August 22, 1992
to finance project preparation activities and the implementation of pilot day-care centers in three cities
to test different delivery modalities and operational arrangements. An evaluation of the pilot phasa
was finalized in April 1993, and its recommendations have been incorporated into the proposed project
design.
11.   Project Management. Overall responsibility fcr implementing the proposed six-year project
is assigned to ONAMFA. It is a role for which it appears well-prepared, given not only its ongoing
administrative modernization program (to be further consolidated under the project), but also its track
record to date in implementing, over the past six-month pilot phase, a total of about 100 home-based
day-care centers in three cities. The formal incorporation of the implementation unit for the proposed
project into ONAMFA's permanent organizational structure at both the central and regional levels
augurs well for its continuity over time. At the national level, the program would be headed by a
national coordinator and would be supported by seven technical staff. Regional teams wjuld be
created in all eight of ONAMFA's regional offices to include about 10 staff. ONAMFAs project
management capacity will be strengthened by its contracting of external supervisors, at the ratio of
one supervisor per 20 centers, and envisaged acti% e participation of NGOs and parents' associations.
Additionally, ONAMFA and MPSSP have entered into a formal agreement delineating the health,
nutrition and related services MPSSP will deliver to project beneficiaries, and the precise fees to be
charged for these services. This agreement would be supplemcnted by individual agreements with
each referral health center to serve project-supported day-wcare centers. A procurement agent would
be contracted to assist ONAMFA in project-related procurement activities. Draft Administradve and
Operations Manuals have been prepared by ONAMFA detailing implementation and related
disbursement, procurement and audit arrangements, and they are satisfactory. Key positions for
project implementation at the national level, and in the three pilot urban areas, have been filled with
qualified staff. The total project cost is estimated to be US$140.2 million equivalent, and
implementation is expected to be completed by June 30, 1999. The estimated costs and financing plan
are given in Schedule A. Arrangements for procurement and disbursements are given in Schedule B.
The timetable of key events for project processing is summarized in Schedule C, and the Status of
Bank Group Operations in Bolivia is provided in Schedule D. A map is attached. The Staff Appraisal
Report No. 11905-BO, dated June 7, 1993, also is atached.
12. Sustainability. Tle proposed project enjoys broad nolitical support. Sustainability rests
principally on the GOB's ability to find "fiscal space" for the proposed project's incremental recurrent
costs. During the first half of implemention (1994-96), however, given the conservative scale of
proposed project operations, the net fiscal impact will not be significant. In the latter years (1997-99),
in which coverage is programmed to increase rapidly, the incremental recurrent costs rise
significantly, representing at the end of the project and annually thereafter US$33.2 million equivalent
(about 1.5 percent of total projected annual public current expenditures). The actual fiscal burden
should not be excessive, however, since the majority (i.e., 58 percent) of these recurrent costs are
attributable to the project's food requirements, virtually all of which are expected to be met from
external sources via food aid. Major agencies providing food aid to Bolivia have strongly endorsed



the proposed project design, and its provision of a coherent framework for targeting food aid to the
neediest subgroups. Firm commitments for project support have been secured from several of these
agencies. Others have indicated their agreement in principle to sustained support througholnt the latter
years of project implementation, as their programming cycle permits. This commitment is reinforced
by a GOB Supreme Decree of March 5, 1993, already mandating the allocation of a significant share
(i.e., US$48.2 million equivalent) of the food aid required by theproposedproject. During appraisal,
the GOB submitted for IDA review projections of social sector investments for the project period to
be fianced from both domestic and external sources. These projections suggest sufficient fiscal space
for the proposed prcoject. Nevertheless, coverage targets will be reviewed during anmal GOB/IDA
project imple-menation reviews, at which the time the GOB will submit an updated projact financial
plan covering the successive three years. IDA's final approval of the program to expand coverage
over the 1997-99 period will be contingent upon an extensive Mid-Term Review with the GOB, to
occur not later than November 30, 1996. This review would be based on an updated project financial
plan, delineating precise cofinancing commitments (including food aid) secured by the GOB for this
forthcoming period, and on the results of the project over its first three years, as reflected in its
ongoing project performance monitcring and impact evaluation systems. As an integral part of the
mid-term project review, the GOB would provide IDA with a sociai sector investment plan to help
assess the plan's financial feasibility, including the proposed ploject, and guide any appropriatm
adjustment to this project's scope and coverage over its final three years of implementation.
13.   Lessons Learned. DA presently is providing financial support to two large ongoing social
sector projects in Bolivia-the Integrated Health Development Project (Credit 2092-BO), and the Social
Investment Fund (Credit 2127-BO). Implementation of these projects has underscored the need to
ensure sustainability of financing and adequate implementation capacity. The design of the proposed
project also draws extensively on findings from a number of Bank Group research papers on early
child development, most notably: "A View from LATHR-Early Childhood Development Programs
in Lain America", August 1992; and "The Eleven Who Survive", March 1987. It also has benefitted
from insights derived from implementation of similar Bank Group-supported projects such as the India
Integrated Child Development Services Project, Colombia Hogares de Bienestar Iifanml, and Mexico
Initial Education Project; and from select integrated nutrition projects such as India's Tamil Nadu
Nutrition Projects. In general, these experiences reveal that: (a) early child development projects are
cost-effective, with the investment more than offset by the savings from reduced student repetition at
the primary school level; (b) non-formal, home-based child development approaches appear to be more
effective in reaching intended target groups, demonstrate a wider spectrum of long-lasting benefits,
and are more cost-effective than formal modalities; (c) close supervision is key to project quality and
success; (d) sustainability of activities and benefits depends on effective community participation; and
(e) effective child development requires the integration of education, health and nutrition services.
The Colombia program, in particular, reveals that it is feasible to mount early child development
projects on a large scale. The design of the proposed project to support te8 PSID systematically has
incorporated features to respond to these important ins4jhts.
14. Rationale for DDA Involvement. IDA's country assistance strategy focuses on supporting
the economic reform program, including GOB's efforts to: streamline the public sector and,
concomitantly, strengthen its performance; promote private sector development; enhance aid
coordination; and ameliorate poverty. With regard to the latter, highest priority is assigned to building
the institutional capacity of the social sectors and, relatedly, to alleviating poverty by assisting
selective well-targeted interventions. The proposed integrated child development project responds
directly to the recognized need to invest significantly in the education, health and nutrition of the
current generation of children if economic and social development is to be sustained. It establishes
the foundation for future expansion of coverage of early child development services to other areas of
the country, for which continued IDA support is envisaged, assuming positive results from the
proposed project. It also is consistent with, and complements, other projects proposed for IDA



-6-
support as an integral part of its poverty-oriented assistance. In specific, the proposed Second SIF
project will finance important complementary inputs such as requisite infrastructr (i.e., water and
sanitation services) to enable communities to qualify for Inclusion in the proposed project, in-patient
nutrition rebabilitaion services for those severely malnourished children who do not respond
adequately to interventions delivered by the day-care cents, and upgrang of local helt centers
which will serve as referral sites for beneficiaries. The proposed Education Reform Project would
establish the policy framework for extending coverage, and enhancing the quality of primary
education. Participation in early child development programs, such as PIDI, enhances readiness for
pnmary education, and thus complements the proposed Education Reform Project.
15.   Agreements Reached. At negotiations, assurances were secm -i from the GO  that: (a)
ONAMPA would maintain management with qulifications and experience satisfactory to IDA, and
the arual audit report will include a separate opinion as to whether CSRP criteria for selection of
personnel have been observed in the choice of staff for project-fnanced CSRP positions; (b) prior to
opening any given group of day-are centers, an agreement would be finalized between ONAMFA
and the respective public or private referral healti cetaer to ensure availability to project beneficiaries
of a minimum acceptable package of health ana nutrition services; (c) the agreed evaluation and
monitoring systems would be under implementation no later han March 31, 1994, and amual reports
on progress and results of the monitoring and evaluation component would be prepared by ONAMFA
and submited for IDA review; (d) it would allocate in its annual budget, for the years 1994 through
1999, and each year thereafter, the following minimum amounts (representing its direct budgetary
contribution and the financing to be sought from donors) for the financing of project expenditures:
US$1.039 milfion for CY94, US$2.287 million for CY95, US$5.38 million for CY96, US$10.58
million for CY97, US$17.78 million for CY98, US$27.73 million for CY99, and US$33.2 million
for each year thereaftr, (e) it would submit for IDA review the results of, and recommendations
deriving from, studies to be carried out under the Sector Policy Development and Management
Strengthening Component and tl; Monitoring and Evaluation Component, in accordance with an
agreed timetable; (f) ONAMFA, through the procurement agent, would submit to IDA for prior
review bidding documents and award recommendations for all contras for goods to be procured
under ICB, and for contracts for goods valued at US$75,000 equivalent and above under LCB; (g)
the annually audited project accounts, in accordance with IDA guidelines, would be submitted to IDA
no later than six monts following the end of the GOB's fiscal year; (O) ONAMFA would submit to
IDA quarterly progress reports on March 31, June 30, September 30, and December 31 each year,
and the quarterly report of September 30 each year shall include: an assessment of overall
implementaion progress over the past year. including implementation indicators, a detailed work plan
for the forthcoming year, and an updated financial plan for the successive three years of project
implementation; and (i) annua reviews with IDA would take place no later than November 30 each
year, and that no later than November 30, 1996, a Mid-term Review would be held to carry out a
comprehensive assessment of£ the implementtion of the PIDI program and the project, including an
assessment of performance against agreed implementation indicators; project financing; and the GOB's
social sector investment plan. A condition of credit effectiveness would be that ONAMFA has
received from the Treasury an amount equivalent to not less than US$340,000 for putposes of
implementing the project during CY93.
16.   Environmental lmpact. The proposed project does not present environmental risks. It has
been assigned a "Cu environmental classification.
17. Progam Objective Categories. The project faills primarily under the human resource
development POC, and is part of the core poverty program. Children and women from the lowest
income households would be the pdncipal beneficiaries. Improved social policy formulation and
analysis capability will assist the GOB to enhance the targeting of its resources. The project also will



-7-
contribute toward improved management cf the main public agency responsible °or the welfare of
women, children and the family-ONAMFA.
18. Benefts. By the end of the proposed project life, an installed capacity of some 8,600 day-care
centers would exist to annually provide non-formal, home-based, integrated child development services
to 130,000 of the country's poorest pro-school children, 6 months to 6 years of age; and cumulatively,
by project end, taking into account anticipated promotions of six year olds, more than 200,000
children are expected to have benefitted. Women also would be direct beneficiaries through project
contributions to expanding employment opportunities (employing caregivers and, via access to day-
care, enabling mothers of participating children to work) and improviAg their knowledge of education,
health and nutrition. Specifically, by its completion, 'the project wiUl have trained and employed some
21,000 caregivers, most of whom are expected to be women. Approximately 8,600 of these
caregivers also would benefit from access to credit to upgrade their homes and, via direct beneficiary
contributions, assistance in the payment of basic utility bills to help offset the cost of using their
homrs for day-care centers. Significant improvements also are expected in the health and nutritional
status of an estimated 16,000 pregnt women who eifter have children participating in tae project,
or are caregivers, as project-secured preferential user fees would increase utilization of pre- and post-
natal care, safe deliveries, and family planning, health and nutrition education and services. An
additional benefit would be the GOB's 3trengthened ability to formulate and evaluate social policy,
particularly in early child development, and food and nutrition.
19. Risks. Principal risks relate to: (a) the possibility that the extensive projec= implementation
demands might outstrip ONAMFA's managerial and admhinitave capacities; (b) uncertaintes over
the continuity of the GOB's initial commitment to absorb fully project-generated recurrent costs over
the project life, crucial to its sustinability; and (c) the danger that desired improvements i children's
nutritional status will not be achieved because of failure to maintain adequate dietary intake at the
household level. With regard to (a), this risk should be minizized by: direct project support for
ONAMFA's modernizaton initiative; ONANFA's planned fell incorporation into the CSRP, thus
facilitating recruitment and retention of high quality staff; anticipated active assistance of NGOs and
community groups in project implemeion; project-supported contacting of extal supervision
staff to permit ONAMFA's close, continuous oversight of day-care activities; a very conservative
implementation fimetable, based on moderate increases in coverage objectives during the first half of
the project, and annual and mid-term project reviews to assess implementaton progress and adjust the
pace and scope of implementation, as needed. With regard to (b), the GOB has committed itself to
a solid fnacing plan and to gradually assuming recu=rent costs on a clearly specified anmnal basis,
including those generated by the CSRP. To help ensure contiung commitmen to this plan, the GOB
will review annuamly with IDA an updated financial plan for the successive three years of project
implementtion. In addition, the GOB will review with IDA at the project's Mid-Term Review its
overall social sector investment plan to ensure that adequate provision is made for project financing.
The issance of the March 1993 Supreme Decree committing counterpart resources to the project also
should minimize this risk. And with regard to (c), intensive health and nuuttion education activities
targeted toward parents of children participating In the project seek to minimize this risk.
20.   Recommendation. I am satisfied that the proposed Credit would comply with the Articles
of Agreement of the Association, and recommend that the Executive Directors approve it.
