1.          The following memorandum aud recommendation for a proposed loan of
US$1.5 million equivalent and development credit of SDR 1.1 (US$1.5 million
equivalenc) to St. Kitts and Mevie (SIN) is submitted for approval.  The
proposed loan would be repayable over 17 years, including five years of grace,
at the Bank's standard variable interest rate. The proposed credit would be
on standard IDA terms, with 35 years maturity. About US$1.9 million
equivalent vould be on-lent to the St. Kitts Sugar Manufacturing Corporation
(SSMC) on the same terms as the Bank loan, plus an annual premium of 1l.
Bilateral financing is expected for the non-sugar component of the project.
The proposed loan and credit would help finance an agricultural development
support project.
PART I - COUgTRY POLICIES AND BAJNK ROUP ASSISTANCE STRATZGY
2.          Backaroutd. until 1980, the island economy of SKU (population
40,535 on an area of 269 km') was based on the production of cane sugar.
During the early 1980., tourism became increasingly important, surpassing
sugar as a foreign exchange earner in 1985 (tourism's share of CDP is
currently estimated at over 10 of CDP). Within a limited and fragile
economic base, the country has achieved a relatively high GNP per capita
(US$2,770 in 1988). At the same time, the costs of developing the basic
infrastructure needed to expand the tourism industry, improve helth
facilities and provide access to educational services bave placed a heavy
burden on domestic resources. SN has maintained political stability saince
independence in 1983. The People's Action Movement Party, ln office since
independence, was reelected in March 1989.
op      3.           SRN, a member of the Organization of Eastern Caribbean States
(OECS), has a limited scope for independent monetary and exchange rate policy.
The OeCS countries osbare a common currency managed by the Eastera Caribbea
Central Bank (ECCB). The exchange rate can only be altered by unanious
agreement. Two key elements provide the system with stabilitys strict
limitations on the ability of Governments to monetize debt by borrowing from
the lCCd and the backing of at least 602 of the demand liabilities of the ICCB
by hard currency assets. Since 1976, the common currency has been pegged to
the United States dollar at ZC$ 2.7 to US$1.0.
4.          The agricultural sector is a key component of SXN's economy,
generating 421 of merchandis exports, almost entirely from sugar, and
employing about 35S of the labor force. Within agriculture, the sugar
Industry accounts for 751 of production and 701 of labor. Food imports supply
30S of domestic food consumption. SOM does not have a strong tradition of
non-sugar farming and production has not been market-oriented. Agricultural



-2-
activities have historically centered around th, sugar industry, which, until
1975, consisted of 52 privately owned estates and one sugar factory. The
entire sugar industry ts now run by the state-owned St. Kitts Sugar
Manufacturing Corporation (SSMC). About 902 of the sugar produced (at a cost
considerably higher than the world free market price) is exported at
preferential prices to quota markets in the UK and the US.
5.          Recent Economic Trgsds and Prosgects.  SKN's economic performance
has been relatively strong in recent years. Real GDP grew on average at over
5 per annum during 1982-89, led by tourism and related construction. The
balance of payments current account deficit increased from about 10 of GDP in
1987 to 15S in 1988 and 1989, reflecting increased imports financed mostly by
grants and highly concessionary loans. The current account surplus of the
consolidated public sector evolved from 42 of GDP In 1986 to about 72 of GDP
in 1987 and then to about 52 in 1988. The decline In public iector savings in
1988 was caused by a 52 reduction in the corporate tax, a 202 public sector
wage increase to restore competitiveness with private sector wages, higher
expenditures on goods and services, and rising operating losses of the
Electricity Department. Growth in tourism and construction has strained
limited labor resources and has resulted in additional wage and cost
pressures, which have reduced overall competitiveness in low-technology, labor
intensive production.
6.          SKR's future development prospects are favorable, assuming
continuation of prudent Government fiscal and debt "mnagement policies and the
absence of major exogenous shocks. These favorable prospects hinge on the
growth of tourism, the expansion of manufacturing and, to a limited extent,
agricultural diversification. Projections of real GDP growth In SoN reflect
the projected rapid growth in tourism, slow declin in the sugar Industry,
relative stagnation in the manufacture of clothing, expansion in electronics
assembly and development of non-sugar agriculture. Private foreign investment
is assumed to finance developments In tourism, but Government borrowing to
support infrastructure requirements will be required from concessional
sources. Overall, real GDP is projected to grow at 4.52 per year during the
1990-2000 period. Real exports of goods and non-factor services are projected
to grow by an average of 6.52 per year during this period, while the real
growth of imports of goods and non-factor services is projected to average
about 32 per year.

7.        External debt in 1988 was US$26.4 million (222 of GDP) and the
external debt service was equivalent to about 21 of exports of good and
services. The ratio of debt service to public sector current revenues
approximated 8S. However, the difficult financial situation of the sugar
industry and the fledgling nature of tourism flows underline the fragility of
the economy given its thin base and vulnerability to external shocks; thus,
SKN should exercise caution in contracting further external debt over the
medium term. The above considerations imply that SIR could be considered
creditworthy for limited non-concessional borrowing.
8 *DelouMen Issues and Priorgties. The central developmsent issu
facing SKI is the diversification of the country's economic base. The growth
In tourism achieved in recent years in response to the Government's
investments in Infrastructure has launched this process. Expansion of tourim
will be based on private investment. In agriculture, the Government's long-
term stratogy is to reduce the dependence on sugar by supporting
diversification into other crops   In manufacturing, SOR has bean successful
in attracting enclave-type industries despite rising labor costs. Rowever,



further expansion requires upgrading skills of the work force to enhance
productivity and overall competitiveness. Availability of funding at
concessionary terms will be required to expand infrastructure and to improve
human resource development.
9.        SRN's development prospects will require addressing the following
is'-ses: (a) increasing public sector savings, especially by containing
current expenditurel (b) promoting non-traditional agriculture through
resolution of land tenure problems, market promotion, and efficiency gans
through improved information and technical assistance services, and divestment
of the sugar Industry; (c) directing the Public Sector Investment Program's
(PSIP) emp_a3is to tourist infrastructure, health facilities and oducation;
and (d) elizusating restrictions on foreign labor to alleviate labor shortages
and wage pressures.
BAI= GROUP 0ASISTANCI
10.       The Bank Group assistance strategy aims at assisting SKY to carry
out the aforementioned policy agenda, and, in particular, to diversify
production to help reduce economic vulnerability and enhance ereditworthines.
This strategy, as well as that for the other oee8 countries, Is contatied In
the Board Document titled "Terms of Lending to Small Island Economies
Graduating from IDA", dated November 18, 1985. SKY was deemde eligible for an
IDA allocation based on the following special features of the countrys
ti) lack of full IBID creditworthiness; (11) high export concentration on
sugar and tourism, and heavy dependence on exports as the source of growth;
(iII) high cost of infrastructure; ('v) limi4ted skills and weak institutional
capacity; Cv) difficulty in achieving economies of scale; and
(vi) vulnerability to climatic conditions.
1I.       Since 1985, the economy of SKI has performed well and policesl have
been basically sound. But conditions that justify IDA eligibility still
prevail and the external enviroment, which has been favorable, is projected
to be less so In the future. Notwithstanding the progress made, the country
requires more time to broaden Its economic base and devolop * growing degree
of resiliene. The country's vulnerability reduces its creditworthines and
access to voluntary commercial credit. It is for these reaoons that SKI and
other O0CS countries continue to be considered eligible for limited IDA
resources.
12.       Lendina Protram. Economic and Sector Work (ISV) and AUd
goordination  The proposed loan and credit would be the eighth direct Bank
Group operation with the o0c8 countries and the first for SKI. SIN has,
however, benefitted from Bank Group loans channelled through the Caribbean
Development Bank (CDB). For the future, CDI is expected to play a greater
role in lending to o0c1 countries in line with the Collaborative Program
agreed between the Bank Group and CDB in 1990. After the project now
proposed, the Bank Group would limit its direct assistance to the O0CS
countries primarily to policy advice, based on the Long-Term Prospects Study
completed In PY90, the CARI0*31     trade report completed in FY91, and selective
further ESN covering regional issues as well as country-specific issues.

Lendig will be choaelled through CDI except for large projects beyond COI's
capacity (which may bo co-financed with CDB) or for those dealing with soctors
where CDB doe. not yet operate. such as projects usalinD  with the eviroment
and those vith a heavy policy content. The Ban k is identifying an OICS
enwirotentael project where, a in any future operation In the OeCS countries,
the blend of IDAtIItD resources will be determined on a country-by-country
basi according to inome level and creditworthiness prospects.  Iu addition,
the Bank will continue in Its role of coordinating and mobilizing external
assistance to the OECS countries through the Caribbean Consultative Group
(COCED). The Bank, a. for other OUCS countries, maintains close coordination
with the IMF In Its ROW program. The IM has not had a formal progrsam ith
SM. It conducts regular Article TV consultations.
13.       The proposed operation is the outgrowth of the rewiew of 8KI's
PSIP, conducted under the auspices of the COCED chaired by the Bank. It forms
the centerpiece of SXN's agriculture PSIP. For the future, and in line with
the collaborative program between the lDak Group and CDBI, the Bank's strategy
in agriculture is to work with CDB in developing a common agricultural sector
strategy for the small Caribbean islands, as the bass for chznnelling
resources through CDB for the financing of projects similar to this one.
AR  II - TU PPT POC
14.       Prolect Objectlves. The key objectives of the proposed project are
to inprove the pace and diversity of SRN'. agricultural development throughs
(i) changes in the incentive frsaework, which are aimed at providing security
of landonership and migrnt labor to work in agriculture (particularly In the
sugar industry); (II) Improvements in agricultural support services and the
Government's agricultural planning capacity; and (III) changes in the
operations of the sugar industry, including its divestment in the second year
of the project.
15.       Prol ct DesgriAt_oa. The project would have two major components.
The agricultural development component would comprise a land administration
program, consisting of a new leasehold titling system, cadastral msapping and
land surveying (16S of project cost); strengtheing of exte4sion and land
services of the Departments of Agriculture (DOAs) (102 of project cost); mad
agricultural planning, including market research and investment promotion (301
of project cost). The project would provide consultancy services, involvtng
46.5 man-months, for cadastral mapping, land surveying, organization and
management review, economic and physical planning, and market development; and
nine local staff to assist with the implementation of the leasing program and
to strengthen the DOAs. External training would be provided for three staff
of the Land Development Corporation (LDC) in land economy and valuation. The
second major component concerning the sugar industry (442 of project cost)
would support the engagement of a small management team to keep the mll
operating, and to Introduce much-needed operational improvements, while a
prospectus is put together to facilitate the sale of the sugar mill no later
than September 30, 1992. The Ministry of Agriculture, Lands, lousing and
Development, St. Kitts (MAS) would have overall responesbility for the
proposed project. The existing functional departments of MAE and the Ministry



- 6 -
of Agricultu, Lands, Labor and Tourism, ewis (MAN) would implement the
aicultural developmt cmponet. The maasemet of the sugar industry,
prior to ito eale, would be contracted to a private mangement tesm. The
total coot of the project Io esttated at US$4.3 million equivalent, with a
foreign ebag  component of US$3.7 million (866). A breakdown of costs and
the fiuancing plan are shoam n Schedule A. Amount. and methods of

these two local staff would be financed on a declining basis, with the
Government assuming 1001 of costs by project completion; (f) WAS and MAN would
provide agricultural extensin services, satisfactory to the Bank and IDA,
ensure that the DOAs bave adequate funds for the provision of extension

1992, establish a timetble in accordance with the above  ction pla,
satisfactory to the Bank and IDA, to close down th. sugar mill In the event
that no satisfactory arrangement has been made to sell the mill and if the
Industry continues to Incur substantial losses, unless the Bank and IDA ohall
otherwise agrset (k) in the event of closure of the sugar mill, comence the
Implementation of the above action plan no later than three months after the
closing takes placel (1) the Central Planning Unit (CPU) would submit to the
Bank and IA the necessary data and information on the project through snnual
progress reports, begining February 28, 1992. CPU would also monitor project
implementation and evaluate the resultsl (m) CPU would annually review with
CDB and the Bank and IDA the PSIP, beginning March 31, 1992, in terms of the
volume of resources available for various sectors relative to development
priorities and adequacy of financaing, including any proposed changes in the
timing and composition of the agreed investmeat program for agriculture; end
(n) LDC would develop and enter into contractual arrangements, satisfactory to
the Bank and IDA, which would bind employees receiving training under the
training progrsm to provide not less than two months of service to LDC for
each month of training received.
17.       ProJect Benefits. The main benefits would come from the
establishment of efficient conditions for agricultural development,
particularly by replacing the one-year agricultural lease system with 35-year
renewable leases, tbereby removing a major deterrent to the developmnmt of the
agricultural sector in SKN. The project would help to provide the policies
and legal framework for the orderly management and future development of land
resources. Direct beneficiaries would be small farmer  and business people
who may be attracted into agricultural development, for whom access to land,
agricultural support services and market information and assistance would be
provided. The proposed project would alsb help stabilize the financial
condition of the ailing sugar industry, while seeking to sell it off as a
going concern, thereby relieving the Government of the financial burden of the
industry that has been losing money due to poor management. The new lesing
program, Including the land use planning study and zoning work to be Initiated
under the project, would lay the framework for more orderly and
environmentally sound development; and the improvements in the management and
operation of the sugar mill and fields being provided under the project would
further enhance the positive environmentally stabilizing aspects of the crop.
As it would be difficult to quantify the benefits of the teconical assistance
and related support for Improving agricultural planning capacity, as ell as
support services under the project, the economic rate of return bas not been
calculated.
18.        jglj. The main risks would be the extent to which interest can be
fostered in the agricultural sector outside of the sugar industry, and the
ability of such entrepreneurs to secure market niches for agricultural   -
products, both within the growing domestic tourist/hotel market and abroad.
Another important risk relates to the timefreme needed for the sale of the



industry end trnfoer to the pr4vate sector. To m4n4n4is the first sot of
risks, the project desig  includes considorable technical asisataDe for
upgraditg  sgrcltual *upport service., nd for aslitlog favor groups  ad
antreprnours to seek out and supply new nAih.s* the latter rlsk to
safeguarded by the provision of investment banking advisory services for the
divostiture.
19.       *begNcrd^io  I an satisfted that the proposod loss and credit
would comply with the Articls of A$reemat of the Bank and IA en  recommead
that the gxecutive Directors approve the proposod loan and credit.
