F. Results Framework Analysis
Project Development Objectives (from Project Appraisal Document)
PDO 1: Trigger employment generation through private sector enterprise growth and reforms in SOE by
containing future losses through privatization or closure of some loss-making SOEs, productive uses of
abandoned assets and improving access to finance for the "missing middle" of MSMEs.

  PDO 2: Help create a competitive private sector banking system by staged withdrawal of government
in state-owned banks through corporatization, leading to substantial divestment of government
shareholding in Rupali Bank, Agrani Bank and Janata Bank, and divestment of minority shareholding in
Sonali Bank.

1. Project Context, Development Objectives and Design
1.1 Context at Appraisal

The country context at appraisal was broadly characterized by an average 5 percent gross growth in gross
domestic product (GDP), moderate inflation at 6 percent, and a fiscal deficit level at around 5 percent.
Although macroeconomic fundamentals appeared stable, there were vulnerabilities of possible trade
imbalance, high level of banking nonperforming loans (NPLs), and unsustainable losses in state-owned
enterprises (SOEs). In the financial sector, reforms had been initiated through the Banking Reforms
Committee. These included a number of measures related to prudential guidelines, supervision by the
Bangladesh Bank, and a legal framework for debt recovery, in addition to restructuring, corporatization,
and finally privatization of Nationalized Commercial Banks (NCBs). Among the manufacturing SOEs, a
legacy in Bangladesh since independence, there were mounting losses, reducing fiscal space for other
desirable social sector spending. This situation led to establishment of the Privatization Commission (PC),
mandated with the task of carrying out SOE reforms by way of closure and divestiture of respective units;
the closure of Adamjee Jute Mills paved the way forward for other SOEs.

The Bank’s Country Assistance Strategy (CAS) FY01-03 was geared toward programmatic lending in
support of reforms and selected investment operations and technical assistance in line with the priorities
of the country’s poverty reduction strategy (I-PRSP and subsequent PRSP). One of the key thrusts of the
Government’s strategy was the emphasis on the pivotal role of the private sector as an engine of growth.
The International Monetary Fund (IMF) at the same time undertook its Poverty Reduction and Growth
Facility (PRGF), which addressed common areas of concern, such as reduction in SOE losses and
privatization of NCBs. The Bank launched the Development Support Credit (DSC) series, comprising
four constituent credits totaling US$900 million, together with supplemental and additional financing of a
further US$175 million, which supported wide-ranging reforms in institutions of economic management
and governance, including banking sector reforms and reduction of losses from SOE operations. Both the
Government’s strategy and the CAS recognized the key role of the private sector in real and financial
sectors and the need for reforms directed toward reducing the Government’s role in state-owned
manufacturing enterprises and banking.

The Enterprise Growth and Bank Modernization (EGBM) project became effective in July 2004, at
a time when the SOE reform issue (including reforms in the financial sector) was the most prominent. The
EGBM project was designed to support the following:

    •   The Government’s policy of reducing and eliminating, over time, its ownership of assets in the
        real and financial sector of the economy, which would help in reducing fiscal deficit through
        reduction of SOE losses
    •   Private-sector-led growth through productive use of SOE assets and promotion of the medium,
        small, and microenterprise (MSME) sector by improving access to finance

1.2 Original Project Development Objectives (PDO) and Key Indicators (as approved)

The development objectives of this project were (i) to trigger employment generation through private
sector enterprise growth and reforms in SOE by containing future losses through privatization or closure
of some loss-making SOEs, productive uses of abandoned assets, and improvements in access to finance
for the “missing middle? of MSMEs, and (ii) to help create a competitive private sector banking system
by staged withdrawal of the Government from state-owned banks through corporatization, leading to

                                                    1
substantial divestment of major government shareholding in Rupali Bank, Agrani Bank, and Janata Bank
and divestment of minority shareholding in Sonali Bank. The performance indicators for the assessment
of the PDOs were as follows:

    •   About 1,500 additional small enterprises received financing from participating financial
        institutions.
    •   Chittagong Steel Mills handed over to BEPZA and refurbished and converted to an Export
        Processing Zone (EPZ).
    •   Adamjee Jute Mills converted to an industrial park.
    •   Khulna Newsprint Mill and Chittagong Chemical Complex refurbished and converted to
        industrial parks.
    •   Around 20 percent of workers retrained or counseled to obtain alternative employment within 12
        months and a further 20 percent within 18 months.
    •   About 80,000 workers retired with a voluntary retirement scheme (VRS) package (of which
        45,000 workers financed under EGBM).
    •   SOE losses for the 95 manufacturing SOEs reduced on average by 10 percent annually.
    •   PC privatizes/liquidates an average of 10 SOEs per year.
    •   A new external management team hired by mid-2004 to manage Agrani Bank.
    •   Management experts for key positions in place at Sonali Bank and Janata Bank by end-2004.
    •   Rupali Bank brought to the point of divestment by end-2004.
    •   Agrani Bank corporatized and by end-2005 brought to the point o f divestment , at which time it
        will hold promise for potential strategic partner(s) to bid for substantial shareholding with
        management control.
    •   Janata Bank corporatized and by end-2006 brought to the point of divestment, at which time it
        will hold promise for potential strategic partner(s) to bid for substantial shareholding with
        management control.

1.3 Revised PDO (as approved by original approving authority) and Key Indicators, with Reasons
and Justification

The Project Development Objective was not revised.

1.4 Main Beneficiaries

The main beneficiaries of the EGBM project are selected public institutions and banks, which in turn lend
to private SME entrepreneurs. The EGBM project contributed to building capacity and institutional
strengthening at a number of state institutions and banks, including the Board of Investment (BOI), PC,
the Bangladesh Export Processing Zones Authority (BEPZA), and the four NCBs. In addition, the Small
Enterprise Development component of the project provided for a line of credit to private sector MSMEs.
The project also directly benefited retiring workers of SOEs, in the form of severance packages, and both
retired and retiring workers from SOEs received counseling and retraining for alternative employment.

1.5 Original Components (as approved)

The project had seven categories in three main themes: (1) enterprise growth, (2) a longer-term program
of adjustment in support of sustained economic growth, and (3) a banking reform program.
The following is the list of project components and their costs with financing arrangements.

1.5.1 Enterprise Growth

    1. Small enterprise development (US$10 million): The Small Enterprise Fund (SEF) was set up as a
       refinancing facility for participating financial institutions (PFIs), such as BRAC Bank, BASIC
       Bank, Midas Financing, Dhaka Bank, and Prime Bank, for on-lending to the MSME sector as
       working capital and term loans.
    2. Refurbishment of some strategic remaining assets of loss-making SOEs (US$20 million):
       This component was provided to cover initial planning and refurbishment costs for utilization of
       unproductive assets, mainly land, following closure of two SOEs (Adamjee Jute Mills and
       Chittagong Steel Mills). The tasks undertaken under this component focused on making these
       assets attractive for private sector investment and possible conversion to export-processing zones
       or industrial parks. In addition, two other sites had been proposed for support, including the
       Chittagong Chemical Complex and Khulna Newsprint Mill.
    3. Institutional Strengthening (US$4 million): This component was directed toward capacity
       building of industrial development institutions such as Privatization Commission, the Board of
       Investment, the Bangladesh Export Processing Zones Authority, and the Bangladesh Small and
       Cottage Industries Corporation (BSCIC). Capacity building of these institutions has been directed
       toward carrying out divestiture and privatization of SOEs, investment promotion seminars,
       training and familiarization tours for BEPZA officials, development and implementation of
       Information and Communication Technology (ICT) programs within the institutions, and
       providing support to strategic investment promotion programs.

1.5.2 Longer-term Program of Adjustment in Support of Sustained Economic Growth

    4. Support to voluntary retirement schemes (US$180 million + US$75 million DFID funding):
       This component of the proposed operation was designed to continue the assistance initiated under
       the DSC, which supported much of the first tranche of 28 SOE closures in 2001–2002. It was
       designed to cover the VRS costs to the Government of a second tranche of about 95 enterprises
       slated for closure/privatization over the period 2002–2003 and 2007–2008. The Bank’s support
       was supplemented by about US$88 million (GBP 50 million) through DFID co-financing in
       support of this project, of which the VRS expenses accounted about US$75 million.
    5. Retraining and counseling services for retired SOE staff (US$10 million DFID funding):
       This component of the EGBM project was provided through DFID funding and was directed
       toward providing adequate counseling and re-training support to retired workers.

1.5.3 Banking Reform Program

    6. Reforming Nationalized Commercial Banks (US$34 million): Reforms in the NCBs had been
       identified by both Government studies and the Financial Sector Assessment Program (FSAP) as
       being particularly urgent. The project was designed to support the Government’s initial reforms
       envisaged in these NCBs. These included
           • privatization of Rupali Bank,
           • hiring of an external management team at Agrani Bank to contain losses, and
           • engagement of banking and management experts at Sonali and Janata Banks in order to
                improve operational performance of these banks.

                                                   3
7. Public Awareness, monitoring and evaluation (M&E), and tracking (US$2 million + US$3
   million DFID funding): This component covered awareness raising, M&E of the reform process,
   and media tracking envisaged under the reform effort focused on dealing with the negative
   perceptions and adverse public opinion on privatization. In addition, this component also
   provided for M&E on the Government’s reform agenda supported through this project.

1.7 Other Significant Changes

   •   Project extension: following a request from the Government: the EGBM project was extended
       for a period of one year, from November 2009 until December 2010, to compensate for initial
       delays and the Institutional Strengthening component. The latter was originally designed to close
       in June 2009, but was extended till the end of the EGBM project.
   •   Bank modernization: The original scope of this component was limited to providing support to
       the Government to (i) hire a sales advisor for Rupali Bank Limited; (ii) hire management
       advisory teams (through consultants) for Sonali, Janata, and Agrani Banks; and (iii) set up a
       minimum information technology (IT) platform for the automation of Sonali, Janata, and Agrani
       Banks. After completion of the advisory activities at the NCBs, however, and as it become clear
       that privatization of these banks would not go forward, the project supported a new form of
       restructuring, involving the hiring of key top managers from the private sector with time-bound
       restructuring terms of reference (TOR) and specific responsibilities to achieve quantifiable targets
       to show reform results. After Sonali, Janata, and Agrani Banks were transformed into corporate
       entities, they were included as new implementing agencies of the project.
   •   Refurbishment of some strategic remaining assets of loss-making SOEs: Two additional
       SOEs had been identified for support under EGBM—Chittagong Chemicals Complex (CCC) and
       Khulna Newsprint Mills (KNM). The Government later dropped the refurbishment program for
       KNM due to lack of investor interest in that location. There was slow implementation progress
       on CCC, and the site also suffered from scarcity of reliable water supply. Given the halting
       implementation and approaching project closing date, the team decided to drop CCC from EGBM
       financing in 2008.
   •   Retraining and counseling: The project had provisions for the Ministry of Labor to undertake
       some retraining of retiring workers opting for VRS. This did not move well, in spite of all the
       efforts by the project coordination unit (PCU). As BRAC (an NGO originally known as
       Bangladesh Rehabilitation Assistance Committee) was already carrying out retraining and
       counseling activities with encouraging results, it was decided that retraining through Ministry of
       Labor be dropped and this component was transferred to BRAC.
   •   VRS component supported by DFID to the extent of $75 million: DFID withdrew support
       after payment of approximately $25 million as it had other development priorities and as DFID’s
       target number of retirees given VRS had been reached.

2. Key Factors Affecting Implementation and Outcomes
2.1 Project Preparation, Design, and Quality at Entry
Rating: Moderately Unsatisfactory

The PDOs were established directly in response to the needs of the country during the project period and
as agreed upon through cross-consultation with various stakeholders, including IMF and UK-DFID.
Government ownership for the program to be supported by EGBM was high. The quality at entry was
assessed by the Quality Assessment of Lending Portfolio (QALP) process was Moderately Satisfactory.
However, on closer review, project design could have been improved on:

    •   In hindsight, and looking at the success factors for privatization projects supported by the Bank,
        the scope of the project was too wide in spite of the high ownership from Government. Such a
        wide scope resulted in a series of design options that lend to slower implementation and lower
        coordination. As soon as government ownership dwindled, implementation significantly slowed.
    •   The number of implementing agencies led to difficulties in the implementation of
        procurement processes and in financial management, which often led to delays in implementation
        and flow of funds. (There were 7 implementing agencies initially, rising to 10 during
        implementation.) This was expressed both by the client and task team members.
    •   While the underlying theme of the project appeared to be SOE reforms (including the banking
        sector), the project became distinctly divided into two parts that were quite unrelated. The
        PCU owned the banking portion of the EGBM project, while some of the Enterprise Growth
        elements such as the Communication/Public Awareness Component got neglected .
    •   While the result framework was fairly well defined in terms of targets, the linkages between
        some enterprise growth project components and desired outcomes was weak: for example,
        support to privatization targets and SOE loss reduction were not explicit in the project
        components except for providing institutional strengthening to the Privatization Commission. The
        desired intermediate outcomes of SOE loss reduction and privatization of units did find mention
        in the DSC series, which was a concurrent operation with the EGBM project and possibly helped
        in the process.
    •   The QALP review noted a low level of integration of environmental safeguards in the EGBM
        project design in terms of ensuring compliance with environmental standards when land was
        made available through the EPZs. In addition, the QALP noted that the SEF had not incorporated
        the screening of subprojects for possible adverse environmental impacts.

Major risks indentified at preparation, which were assessed as Substantial, included s slowing of the pace
of privatization and a lack of political will in implementing banking reforms. These clearly manifested
themselves during implementation and would have an impact on sustainability of development outcomes
going forward.

2.2 Implementation
Rating: Moderately Satisfactory

The implementation progress of the EGBM project, as evidenced through mid-term reviews (MTRs),
Implementation Status Reports (ISRs) and QALP, was generally rated as Moderately Satisfactory. The
project was flagged for disbursement delays toward the end in 2010. The significant changes in
implementation arrangements and components have been described in section 1.7.


                                                    7
Some of the salient issues captured during the implementation support reviews are as follows:

    •   The slow-down of the SOE reform process led to the dropping of KNM and CCC units from
        being converted to EPZs, and the slow off-take of VRS resulted in nonutilization of about
        $22million as indicated in the ISR (June 2010). The VRS component continued with retirees from
        other SOEs, some of whom were not from the original set of 95 SOEs.
    •   The 2007 MTR noted some issues with the Social Safety Net component. It faced initial problems
        in implementation and could not be administered by the Ministry of Labour (MoL), and the
        portion allocated to MoL was added to the component being administered by BRAC.
        Subsequently, there were problems in identifying and targeting of the displaced SOE employees,
        which ultimately led to under utilization of the allocated funds.
    •   The 2007 MTR noted the change in possible direction on banking sector reforms supported by the
        EGBM project from divestment to corporatization and use of management contracts, but under
        government ownership.
    •   Subsequent ICRs noted progress on the performance of State-Owned Commercial Banks (SCBs)
        in terms of agreed performance indicators, and the same was evident during the ICR process. The
        Government has decided to continue the management contract model even beyond the EGBM
        project. Some governance-related issues are still unattended by the authorities in the SCBs, such
        as fit and proper criteria for selection of board members.
    •   The automation program supported all the SCBs to develop and adopt an IT investment plan, and
        the initial phase of the plan was implemented under EGBMP. Given the size of the SCBs (in
        terms of number of branches, business processes, and manpower), the support under EGBMP
        could only provide partial solutions of online banking to a limited number of bank branches, and
        the banks will now need to continue the reform process for automation, funding the cost from
        their own resources/budgets.

2.3 M&E Design, Implementation, and Utilization

The project design had built-in a system of effective M&E, to be set up in the PCU to monitor the
achievement of outcomes in the short and medium terms, including performance of consultants; progress
of privatization, VRS, job creation, and MSME financing; and social safety tracking through DFID
support. Although the PCU closely monitored the achievement of some project outcomes, it did not set up
the envisioned M&E system, which could have been used very effectively for project management.
Finally the Public Awareness and Communication component designed did not get implemented during
the project.

2.4 Safeguard and Fiduciary Compliance

2.4.1 Financial Management

Financial management processes were found to be generally satisfactory throughout the project.
Quarterly financial reporting through Financial Monitoring Reports (FMRs) was adequate and for the
most part timely during the project, although at the time of writing in May 2011 the Bank has still not
received consolidated quarterly reports from MoF for the final quarter, January–March 2011. There are no
pending audit reports in the project, which has been audited by the Foreign Aided Project Audit
Directorate (FAPAD) of C&AG as external auditor. All material audit observations as identified by the
Bank have been resolved. Initially the project was hampered by a lack of coordination between the PCU
and the implementing agencies, with some incidences of delay in adjustment of advances and inadequate

                                                   8
documentation leading to delay in release of payment to vendors. These issues were subsequently solved
by improving coordination between PCU and implementing agencies through the strengthening monthly
reporting arrangements, timely settlement of advances by agencies, and faster payment to third parties.

2.4.2 Procurement

The project design had built-in procurement guidelines and arrangements for all components of the
project, and implementation was satisfactory. Over the implementation period of six-and-a-half years,
the project was subject to post-procurement review by the Bank on an annual basis. No irregularity of
serious nature was found in procurement activities during the Bank’s reviews. However, some of
procurement entities had limited procurement experience in Bank-financed projects, and the risks
associated with this inexperience were considered substantial. BSCIC, BOI, and PC are yet to develop
adequate procurement management capacity for handling large scale procurements. On the other hand, all
the agencies completed most of the contracts within the original project closing period despite the fact
that they had considerable weakness in contract management capacity. Procurement oversight during
implementation was adequate considering the number of implementing agencies, and the implementation
support missions have reported satisfactory procurement oversight. The procurement postreview report
from the MTR states that documentation and compliance has been generally satisfactory.

2.4.3 Social and Environment Safeguards

The project design had incorporated good consideration of social aspects of this intervention, and
implementation of proposed social safeguards was generally satisfactory. There were no social
safeguard issues identified during implementation support missions. Social protection measures included
counseling, retraining, job placement, and credit support, including the creation of a social tracking
system. The operation also considered opportunities for partnership with civil society organizations like
BRAC. During implementation of the project the Social Safety Net component could not be implemented
through the MoL, but BRAC was effectively used to administer the programs. However, greater
supervision effort could have addressed some of the remaining elements, such as public awareness and
social accountability.

The EGBM project did, however, present some limitations on environmental safeguard issues, both
in design and implementation. These issues were also highlighted by the various implementation
support missions, including the QALP. The project proposed technical assistance through environmental
consultancy to BEPZA and PC for strengthening their capacity to address environmental liabilities
associated with sale of SOEs, and in construction of EPZs. On the SEF component there were no specific
attempts made to mainstream environmental safeguards by the SMEs using SEF refinance. Environmental
aspects also received little attention during supervision, and no environmental impact assessment (EIA)
was carried out for implications that could have arisen from the refurbishment of SOE assets. During the
ICR mission the subject was discussed, and BEPZA has agreed to carry out the EIA and then implement
required safeguards for the EPZs.

2.5 Postcompletion Operation/Next Phase

2.5.1 Access to Finance for MSMEs (Small Enterprise Fund)

The World Bank support to the SEF has enabled MSME lending to take off in Bangladesh. Improved
access to finance continues to be on the priority list of Bangladesh Bank and the participating financial
institutions, and SME lending has grown considerably. Most private banks have also opened a window
for SME financing, and regular meetings are held between the Government and financial institutions to
ensure flow of credit to SMEs. It may also be noted that the Asian Development Bank (ADB) and the

                                                   9
Japan International Cooperation Agency (JICA) have also started their support to MSME lending through
the SEF window. Discussions held during the ICR mission revealed the need for support to financial
market infrastructure, including a credit rating, collateral registry, credit guarantees, and other risk-
sharing mechanisms to improve the flow of credit to the MSME sector.

2.5.2 Economic Zones

Continuing on the private-sector-led growth agenda, the Government has moved to a new regime of
economic zones, built on the success of EPZs, as well as the reality of tight budgets, where public funds
can no longer support BEPZA as the developer of EPZs. The Government has enacted the Economic
Zones Act, based on the application of private participation and commercial principles coupled with
environmentally and socially compliant industrialization. This new regime, supported by the recently
approved Private Sector Development Support Project 1 and other donors including IFC and UK-DFID,
will allow the Government to develop and pilot an approach that is less reliant on government fiscal
subsidies, while leveraging comparative advantages and private sector capability where possible.

2.5.3 Institutional strengthening for Private Sector Development

One of the most successful initiatives under the institutional component has been the use of counselors to
facilitate and upgrade sound labor management relationships within the EPZs. IFC’s advisory facility, the
Bangladesh Investment Climate Fund (BICF), has continued the funding of the EPZ counselors and
expanded their role to cover comprehensive workplace monitoring and compliance, and will continue to
work in establishing the long-term sustainability of this critical function. IFC-BICF is also continuing to
support BEPZA’s automation and environmental management capacities, as well as assisting both
BEPZA and the Board of Investment in investment promotion responsibilities.

2.5.4 Banking Reforms

The Government has expressed its desire for an extension of the program to reinforce the improvements
achieved in the operations of the SCBs attained through the EGBM project. The agenda of restructuring
the NCBs has moved forward, although at a pace slower than originally envisaged because of the political
difficulties of reform. While significant gains in operational parameters of SCBs in terms of NPL
reduction, and net interest margins, have been attained in the three NCBs, it is important to hold onto
these gains by way of continuing monitoring of these banks, which could be done through some oversight
mechanism by the Bangladesh Bank.

3. Assessment of Outcomes
3.1 Relevance of Objectives, Design, and Implementation

The development rationale behind the project remained relevant throughout implementation and
continues to be relevant. The CAS Progress Report 2 praised the Government’s reforms in the SOE sector
and efforts to reduce public participation in manufacturing, SOE losses, and reliance on budget financing.
The CAS explicitly recognized EGBM and stated that further World Bank support would be provided as
the Government continued its efforts to withdraw from the manufacturing sector and to restructure the
entire SOE sector. Similarly, the report noted the need for urgent reform in the NCBs and explicitly

                                                          10
supported the engagement of the Government in dialogue on reforms to reduce operating costs within
these banks through restructuring, reconstituting NCB boards, and using management contracts for
eventual privatization.

Presently, the project objectives remain relevant to the country’s strategic priorities. The second PRSP 3
calls for putting Bangladesh “into a trajectory of high-performing growth? by taking advantage of its low-
cost labor for faster expansion of labor-intensive manufacturing activities, as well as paying closer
attention to investment climate reforms to spur increased domestic and foreign investment. Similarly, the
current CAS4 also supports the Government’s ambitions by contributing to accelerated, sustainable, and
inclusive growth through increasing transformative investments and enhancing the business environment.
Finally, the recent CAS 2011–2014 states that increasing transformative investment and enhancing
business environment under the pillar of accelerated growth are expected to lead to an improved
environment for private sector investment, reaffirming the relevance of the EGBM project in the current
context.

3.2 Achievement of Project Development Objectives

3.2.1 Project Development Objective 1: Trigger employment generation through private sector
enterprise growth and reforms in SOE by containing future losses through privatization or closure of
some loss-making SOEs, productive uses of abandoned assets, and improving access to finance for the
“missing middle? of MSMEs.

The project has been successful in its development objective of employment generation through
private sector enterprise growth. The SEF, in particular, not only surpassed its target objectives but has
also provided a demonstration effect, and its success has led to replication, with further similar schemes
being set up in Bangladesh Bank, and has also drawn other donors like the African Development Bank
(ADB) and JICA to its fold. To date, the SEF has financed up to 2,773 enterprises and generated
incremental employment of approximately 5,000 people. The refurbishment of Adamjee Jute Mills and
Chittagong Steel Mills is commendable, not only in the positive impact it has created, but also in the
potential in the immediate future for demonstrating an export-led industrial growth through private
investors with better regulatory compliance. In a short span of time, new firms started operations,
exporting from both Adamjee and Karnaphuli EPZs. BEPZA has created a total of 589 industrial plots in
the two zones, of which 472 have already been allotted to 196 foreign and domestic investors, and five
four-storey factory buildings have been leased to investors. The two EPZs account for cumulative
investment of US$210 million, employing 90,000 local workers, with exports accounting for over $500
million. 5 The presence of AEPZ and KEPZ has also resulted in growth and expansion of various logistical
services in the surrounding area, including banking, trucking, and food-supply, and it is estimated that
when both zones are fully operational, they will be accountable for employment generation of up to
120,000 people within and outside the EPZs.

Although the SOE privatization program was only partially implemented, hard budget constraints became
a reality, and SOEs came to terms with the idea that they will not have the support of the MoF in meeting
their wage bills. Consequently, there was rationalization of personnel and scaling down of wage bills in
all SOEs. The privatization initiative lost traction early on in the project and came to a complete halt with
the new government that came in to power in January 2009. It needs to be noted that the project
components intended to lead to reduction in SOE losses and privatization were just the Institutional

Strengthening components that helped these institutions develop their information systems, hardware, and
human capacity and obtain relevant international exposures, but they were not linked directly to attaining
the outcomes given in the results framework for SOE losses or number of units privatized. Hence, the
attribution of these results to the implementation of this project seems fairly weak. The same linkage issue
is also weak for the growth in FDI attained by BOI.

As to retraining and counseling, these initially faced challenges in locating retrenched workers due to
their vastly dispersed positions physically. Nonetheless, BRAC still managed to reach out to a total of
46,689 families, whose retrenched working members received counseling as their first participatory
activity, and training was provided to 22,214 workers and family members. Furthermore, 13,147 workers
and family members received microcredit, and 15,423 children of retrenched workers received education
stipends. Although most participants were initially eager to find new jobs, an unfriendly job market and
reluctance on the workers’ part to engage in new skill development meant that this program was not able
to generate employment in large numbers. Ultimately, the Job Information Bank registered 2,819
individuals and generated employment for 1,309 workers. 6

3.2.2 Project Development Objective 2: Help create a competitive private sector banking system by
staged withdrawal of government in state-owned banks through corporatization, leading to substantial
divestment of government shareholding in Rupali Bank, Agrani Bank, and Janata Bank and divestment of
minority shareholding in Sonali Bank.

Though the National Commercial Banks could not be taken forward on the path of privatization by
the EGBM project, the revised arrangements to use performance-based management contracts
were fairly successful in improving operational performance. In addition, the NCBs were
corporatized and brought under the Banking Companies Act regulated by Bangladesh Bank. The
objective in the Bank Modernization component was to improve governance and efficiency of the public
sector banks through the restructuring of NCBs. The initial design of providing support to privatization
of all four NCBs never received the Government’s nod, and in the end, the project settled for privatization
of the smallest NCB—Rupali Bank—which was also not achieved due lack of adequate private sector
interest and differences in valuation. Although the State-Owned Commercial Banks (SCBs) remain
weaker than private banks, their performance has improved under corporatization and due to the reform
program that is based on incentives and goals monitored by Bangladesh Bank. At an overall level for the
SCBs, the project period has seen the following achievements with respect to wider financial sector goals
and operational performance of SCBs:

       •   The total NPLs of the state-owned banks has come down from about 25 percent in 2004 to around
           12 percent in 2010.
       •   The share of incremental bank deposit and credit from state-owned banks showed a downward
           trend, which can also be read as growth in market share of private sector banks. In overall terms,
           the share of state-owned banks in lending declined from 43 percent in 2004 to 33 percent in 2007,
           and the share in deposit declined from 50 percent in 2004 to 30 percent in 2010.
       •   Progress on capital shortfall (relative to capital adequacy requirements) is not very clear from the
           data obtained and shows varying levels—which could be due to changes in provisioning and risk
           weight classifications. Data obtained from Bangladesh Bank shows a progress on capital

    •   Overall performance of SCBs showed some operational improvements in NPL ratios and debt
        recoveries of NPLs in cash. All three SCBs have significantly reduced their NPL ratio as a
        percentage of loan portfolio. As a result, the actual NPLs have dropped by 21.5 percent for Sonali
        bank, 23.9 percent for Janata bank, and 19.8 percent for Agrani bank in 2008.

Refer to annex 2 for additional data and information on results.

3.3 Efficiency

The PAD had outlined an economic analysis based on VRS expenditures and benefits thereof, and this
was based on comparison between costs and benefits that are derived from cash flows of a planned labor
severance program. The Economic and Financial Analysis section in PAD had undertaken a very limited
financial analysis view of a payback in less than three years without taking into consideration the
economic and/or social costs and benefits of such an operation. With the VRS component exceeding the
planned numbers, the estimated payback period has been met. However, since the project included serious
social costs of retrenchment and was supplemented by increased employment through creation and
expansion of new private sector enterprises, an overall economic internal rate of return (EIRR) could have
been attempted at the design stage. Limitations in standards and data for a social cost-benefit analysis on
conversion factors do not allow for such analysis at this stage. It may also be noted that structured
procurement systems followed by the implementation agencies such as BEPZA resulted in small savings
from budgeted costs, and to that extent the investment component was cost-efficient.

3.4 Justification of Overall Outcome Rating
Rating: Moderately Satisfactory

The project achieved its objective of enterprise growth measured by way of increased private sector
investment and employment satisfactorily, and the objectives remain relevant in the present socio-
economic context of Bangladesh. However, the EGBM project did not manage to drive SOE reforms in
Bangladesh, and there was no significant reduction in the involvement of the Government or in its
ownership of SOEs. Limited fiscal gains were achieved by containing SOE losses, which were brought
about primarily by the VRS component. It may also be noted that the privatization agenda did not go
forward as envisaged in the project, which was due to a number of factors, such as lack of political will in
the existing and changed governments, and that the project design had not built in adequate support for
such an ambitious and politically sensitive program. On the Banking Reform component, the project did
well to redesign the component around improving the performance of state owned banks under state
ownership by use of management contracts, and instead of outright privatization. In overall terms, the
EGBM project had six components of which three components led to satisfactory outcomes.

3.5 Overarching Themes, Other Outcomes, and Impacts

3.5.1 Poverty Impacts, Gender Aspects, and Social Development

BEPZA’s conversion of the two closed SOEs into successfully running EPZs has provided jobs for over
23,000 people directly, and it is estimated that they will provide employment for up to 120,000 people
both directly and indirectly, once they are fully operational. Furthermore, women represent around 65
percent of workers in zones, suggesting that zones have been useful in creating economic participation for
women in Bangladesh. An assessment of BRAC’s implementation of its Social Protection Package for
Retrenched SOE Workers (the Kallyan project) shows that project participants experienced significant
positive impacts on asset holding, including livestock, poultry, and land. There is also evidence of

                                                    13
increased engagement in business activity as the primary occupation of participating retrenched workers.
It was also found that per capita income of participant households increased, and the income share from
day labor was lower compared to that of nonparticipant households, indicating that participating
households’ dependency on day-labor had fallen significantly. Furthermore, the project played a positive
role for educating girls of participating households, with higher female enrolment rates, compared to non-
participating households.

3.5.2 Institutional Change/Strengthening

The Institutional Strengthening components of the project were directed toward capacity building of
BEPZA, BOI, and PC, which have key roles to pay in encouraging private investment and growth. The
EGBM project successfully completed the following institutional strengthening elements:

    •   Basic IT infrastructure for MIS has been set up for the EPZs managed by BEPZA.
    •   Professional counselors for providing advice on regulatory compliance and labor-related issues
        have been recruited and trained.
    •   BEPZA is in process of developing an environmental plan for the EPZs.
    •   A number of investment promotion seminars have been carried out for investors from various
        countries, and training and study tours have been undertaken by BEPZA.
    •   BOI Service Tracking system and BOI Information Management System have been set up on a
        network and are fully operational.
    •   Investor handbooks and other promotional literature have been developed by BOI.
    •   BSCIC has also benefited by the project in terms of ICT systems development and automation of
        information and work flow processes.
    •   While the Privatization Commission developed a comprehensive privatization program and the
        project provided some assistance by way of consultants for valuation, tendering processes, and
        hardware and information systems, the privatization program got derailed for lack of government
        commitment during the early stages of the EGBM project.

3.5.3 Other Unintended Outcomes and Impacts (positive or negative)

The Bank has taken a lot of criticism for supporting the closure of state-owned jute and textile mills under
the DSC program. Although golden handshakes were given out through IDA credit, because alternative
employment was not available for most retrenched workers, these retrenchment programs remained
highly unpopular (even though the project had built in retraining components), giving vent to populist
opinion that the Bank was creating poverty rather than reducing it.


4. Assessment of Risk to Development Outcome
Rating: Significant

The major risks to sustainability of the outcomes achieved under the EGBM project are as follows:

Privatization and SOE losses: The SOE privatization program seems to have been abandoned by the
Government, and there is no other initiative that would improve the governance and operations of SOEs,

                                                    14
and more specifically the manufacturing SOEs. In addition, there have been pay increases given to SOE
employees. The Privatization Commission has also lost its initial momentum, and in the past few years no
SOEs have been handed over to the PC for either closure or divestment. Going forward, it would be
difficult to hold the limited gains on SOE losses achieved from this project.

Banking reforms: The NCBs remain under government ownership, though now corporatized under the
Banking Companies Act, and the operational performance gains attained are at a risk of getting derailed
in the absence of a strong institutional monitoring mechanism, even if the management contracting
continues beyond the EGBM project. The World Bank support to SEF has enabled MSME lending to take
off in Bangladesh.


5. Assessment of Bank and Borrower Performance
5.1 Bank Performance

5.1.1 Bank Performance in Ensuring Quality at Entry
Rating: Moderately Unsatisfactory

As noted earlier, the project had weaknesses in design in terms of linkage of Institutional Support
components and the desired results in overall terms.

Weaknesses included the following:

    •   The overarching objective of the project was centered on the SOE privatization initiative,
        including that of government banks. The project components were inadequate in terms of
        attaining such politically sensitive objectives as activities that would lead up to privatization of
        SOEs ( including banks).
    •   Targeted reduction in SOE losses were solely based on retrenchment of SOE employees.
    •    Earlier reviews (QALP) have also noted lack of proper integration of environmental safeguards
        in the EPZ and SEF components.

Strengths included the following:

    •   The specific investment components such as VRS and EPZs, were well designed and directed
        toward attaining the limited objectives of increasing private sector investment and employment.
    •    The project design included social safety and communication components to address the after
        effects of a privatization program

5.1.2 Quality of Supervision
Rating: Moderately Satisfactory

Bank supervision has been rated satisfactory. The project was really slow to take off, and some mid-
course corrections had to be made in some components of the project. The Bank team was proactive and
worked in coordination with the many implementing agencies, particularly BEPZA and the state-owned
banks, which enabled the project to move forward following a slow start. The political environment was
not very conducive for such a large and transformative reform program during a major part of the
implementation period. The Bank team was appreciated by most implementing agencies during the ICR

                                                    15
process, and the implementing agencies were found to be very motivated and were actively supportive of
World Bank’s involvement, particularly in the BEPZA Export Processing Zones and the performance
monitoring done on the SCBs. On the fiduciary front, procurement arrangements were robust and
managed well with no exceptions during the course of the project. Financial management systems were
satisfactory with no major audit or reporting concerns.

5.1.3 Justification of Rating for Overall Bank Performance
Rating: Moderately Satisfactory

The overall Bank performance has been rated as moderately satisfactory for this project as the
overarching objective of SOE reform was only partially attained, in part because the project was executed
through very difficult times of varying client commitment and political changes. The Government and
implementing agencies were satisfied with the performance of task team and were appreciative of the
strong supervision provided by the Bank. The task team did well to recognize the futility of pursuing a
divestment agenda for NCBs and changed its approach to management contracts and was able to drive
some of the desired results. The VRS component, however, did not disburse fully both because of slow
execution and change in policy direction with regard to SOEs. In addition, the Bank provided good
support to the number of implementing agencies on fiduciary aspects and there were no major issues in
either procurement or financial management during the course of the project. Finally, in spite of the
difficult political circumstances that prevailed during the period, the Bank team managed to complete the
project with limited extension.

5.2 Borrower Performance

5.2.1 Government Performance
Rating: Moderately Satisfactory

The Government started with strong commitment to reforms through privatization of manufacturing and
banking sector SOEs when the EGBM project was designed. However, support to the privatization
program gradually weakened as the project progressed and was subsequently abandoned. This period
also saw political changes, including a transient caretaker government, which also weakened commitment
to the privatization program. Under these circumstances the overall project coordination unit under the
MoF did well to execute some of the major elements of the project, such as the VRS and refurbishment of
the EPZs through BEPZA and the SEF through Bangladesh Bank. The overall commitment and strong
supervision provided by the PCU enabled completion of the EGBM project without major delays, and
over 90 percent of the planned expenditure was completed.

5.2.2 Implementing Agency or Agencies Performance
Implementing Agencies Rating: Satisfactory

There were a number of implementing agencies in the project, and the number increased during the
project, with all the three NCBs becoming classified as implementing agencies midway through the
project. Table 2 provides an assessment of their performance resulting discussions held during the
implementation mission. The assessment was based on a broad judgment of capacity, the extent of
involvement of senior personnel in the project, completion of project components, and achievement of
outcomes.

Rating: Moderately Satisfactory.

Based on the above described assessment, overall borrower performance has been rated as Moderately
Satisfactory.


6. Lessons Learned
1. There is a need to be cognizant of political situation and its propensity to change in Bangladesh
   for planning Bank interventions: A major factor to be taken into account while crafting the reform
   agenda and its implementation format is the antagonistic and highly confrontational relationship
   between the two major political parties. It is felt that this antagonism prevents Bangladesh from
   reaching its full potential as a functioning democracy. Shrill political differences often manifest in
   violent clashes and preclude any sort of debate or political consensus on reforms from emerging. As
   a result, reform measures, rather than gaining momentum, have tended to be opportunistic and
   sporadic.
2. SOE reforms could also be handled without outright privatization: It important to recognize that
   SOEs reforms need to be handled carefully, and to an extent they can be accomplished without
   completely doing away with government ownership. As demonstrated in the case of state-owned
   banks, it may be useful to recognize that similar corporatization moves for other SOEs coupled with
   better corporate governance structures can help in making the SOEs more commercially oriented and
   incorporate elements of market discipline without a complete change in ownership. Small and
   progressive divestment in capital markets with the state remaining the majority shareholder could be
   an alternative to outright divestiture.
3. Reforms in state-owned banks require strong and continued oversight by the regulator in order
   to retain the gains achieved: The SCBs (as NCBs are now called) are showing operational
   performance improvements but would need substantial capacity building and possible shoring up of
   their capital bases before they can access capital markets for equity. It may be better to address
   banking SOEs through a separate engagement in the future rather than in tandem with manufacturing
   SOEs, as the issues are quite different and have different implications for the financial sector of the
   economy.
4. It may have been better to have fewer mutually reinforcing components: The project had a large
   number of disjoint components with many implementing agencies, which made implementation
   difficult and lacked an overarching common direction. In addition, the period of implementation was
   too long for making an SOE reform program effective. VRS programs need to be supplemented by
   more effective social safety nets and stronger public awareness and communication campaigns.

7. Comments on Issues Raised by Borrower/Implementing Agencies/Partners
7.1 Borrower/Implementing Agencies

The borrower and implementing agencies were in general satisfied with the performance of the Bank
during implementation of this project. The major comments provided by the borrower and implementing
agencies that can help in future projects are as follows:
    • Implementing agencies that were involved in physical infrastructure investment components,
        such as BEPZA, were of the view that the process of flow of funds after the actual contracts have
        been awarded required a number of levels of scrutiny, which could have been avoided. This issue
        has been addressed for subsequent projects like PSDSP.
    •   The implementing agencies appreciated Bank supervision in enabling project implementation,
        particularly during periods of political uncertainty.
    •    The MoF suggested that the project could have incorporated some additional capacity within the
        implementing agencies, particularly for review of consulting reports given on the state-owned
        banks.
    •   The Government felt that the number of implementing agencies was large for the Project
        Coordination Unit to manage effectively.

7.2 Cofinanciers

DFID was the only cofinancier for the EGBM project, and DFID contributed to the Social Safety Net
component of the project. DFID expressed the view that privatization programs need to be supplemented
by a strong communication component that addresses concerns of the public at large.

7.3 Other partners and stakeholders

There were no views obtained from any other stakeholder on this project.

BEPZA                                  BEPZA was fully automated, including integrated MIS and a Web-based network.
                                       Investment promotion seminars were held globally and promotional video campaigns in various
                                       languages were produced.
                                       Training was given on HR management; industrial relations management for mid-level management;
                                       toxic and hazardous waste management; IT application in management; management of organizational

Board of Investment            Board of Investment introduced phased e-governance, with an automated comprehensive information
                               management system and database containing micro- and macrolevel economic data, and an online
                               service tracking system. The BOI Service Tracking (BOST) allows 24-hour online tracking, with time-
                               bound service processing, and also provides dynamic Web-based database support.
                               The BOI Information Management System (BIMS) comprises MIS on local investment, FDI, and joint
                               venture investments; industrial, financial and technical assistance; utility services; macroeconomic and
                               other industrial data; visitors’ information; IRC information; foreign credit; law, policies, and
                               agreements related to investment; work permit management; HRD; budget; and library and inventory.
                               BOI has also developed a comprehensive database covering all the companies registered with BOI. This
                               has been a major development given BOI lacked any systematic background information on entry, exit
                               and growth of its approved investments. The newly developed database covers over 13,000 registered
                               companies and comprises details on their investment, annual turnover, employment, working capital,
                               and operational management. This database has also been designed to be compatible with BIMS,
                               thereby allowing all new companies registering with BOI to automatically be listed in the overall
                               company database. The database will serve an effective purpose for future survey work as well as
                               generating a myriad of practical data at-a-glance.
                               As part of investment promotion activities, promotional materials were prepared, including CDs and
                               investment handbooks, and exposure tours were conducted both domestically and internationally.
Bangladesh Small and Cottage   Automation: BSCIC operationalized LAN and WAN networking throughout its head office and
Industries Corporation         regional offices, which will allow data to be entered directly from the field.
                               BSCIC has also developed and installed software for the Accounts and Finance, MIS, and Personnel
                               divisions. A computer-aided design (CAD) system has been introduced to the Design Centre and Civil
                               Engineering Division, allowing the designers and engineers to design and plan with accuracy.
                               Following the introduction of AutoCAD, the Design Centre has also been operating as an HR
                               development centre, with three-month courses (consisting of 20 to 25 people) for the public in twelve

Privatization Commission       Computers, software, and LAN network were set up. However, PC had very limited success with
                               privatization, which they mainly attribute to three reasons: (i) lack of clean entitlement of the sites—
                               some are still pending at court; (ii) lack of government appetite to provide PC with new SOEs and

Longer-term Program of Adjustment in Support of Sustained Economic Growth
Support to Voluntary Retirement Schemes
                                     57,400 workers from various loss-making SOEs were provided VRS.

Retraining and counseling services for retired SOE staff
                                        The Social Protection Package for Retrenched SOE Workers—BRAC Kallyan Project—had the primary
                                        objective of enhancing targeted retrenched workers’ social and economic capabilities and to provide
                                        health, education, and employment support for their families. It specifically targeted families of
                                        formerly enlisted retrenched workers and unlisted casual workers who lost their jobs since 2001 from
                                        the closure of state-owned enterprises.

                                       Outputs were as follows:
                                       Counseling provided to 46,689 retrenched workers and their families
                                       Training provided to 22,214 workers
                                       Credit provided to 13,147 workers/families
                                       Child education stipend provided to 15,423 children, of which 6,942 were girls
                                       Job Information Bank registered 2,809 prospective employees and generated employment for 1,139

SCBs
                                        Move toward a market-based financial sector resulting in a more viable and efficient system of financial
                                        intermediation.

                                       Measurable indicators

                                       Reduced share of NCBs in banking sector assets: The share of incremental bank deposit and credit from
                                       state-owned banks showed a downward trend, which can also be read as growth in market share of
                                       private sector banks. In overall terms the share of state-owned banks in lending declined from 43% in
                                       2004 to 33% in 2010, and the share in deposit declined from 50% in 2004 to 30% in 2010.


                                                                        22
              Lower percent of NPLs: The total NPLs of the state-owned banks has come down from about 25% in
              2004 to around 12% in 2010.
               Improving capital adequacy: Progress on capital shortfall (relative to capital adequacy requirements) is
              not very clear from the data obtained and shows varying levels, which could be due to changes in
              provisioning and risk-weight classifications. Data obtained from Bangladesh Bank shows progress on
              capital adequacy (measured by % of risk-weighted assets) from 4.1% in 2004 and -0.84% in 2005 to
              8.92% in 2010.
              Higher profitability of banking: Return on equity of the private banks stood at 16.7 percent in 2007 and
              at percent, while in 2002 the indicator was 11.6 percent.

UK-DFID co-financed US$88.39 million specifically for the VRS and Social Safety Net component of
this project. As mentioned earlier, DFID withdrew support for the VRS component after payment of
approximately $25 million, as it had other development priorities and as its target number of retirees
given VRS had been reached. BRAC continued to support the Social Safety Net component via direct
grant funding, although there was initially some slow disbursement. It was very challenging to reach all
the workers as they were scattered around the country following the closure of the SOEs. Nonetheless,
BRAC made impressive efforts to track the workers as far as possible. The presence of BRAC offices
around the country was of huge assistance.

At the end of the project, the main risk is sustainability of the various reforms initiated. Most important,
the initiative of privatization or reform of SOEs needs to continue to mitigate government losses, which
are still very high. Though it was expected that reforms of SOEs would continue at a higher pace during
the regime of the caretaker government, this was not evident. After 2007, privatization and/or reforms in
SOEs slowed down. The situation has not changed since the democratic government came into power in
early 2009. Also, there is risk in terms of the sustainability of the safety net program. The children of
many of the retrenched workers are not yet in a position to earn for the family and may have to stop their
education if they do not continue to receive the stipend provided. However, after closing the current
project, the safety net programs will come to an end unless BRAC mainstreams the activities into its
operations, as suggested to BRAC at the beginning of 2011.

Although there was a lack of coordination among Government agencies, and between the Government
and donors, all the stakeholders remained committed to the project, which allowed it to deliver results.
The lack of coordination may be ascribed to the initial project design, by which the VRS component and
Social Safety Net components were to be implemented in parallel rather than in an integrated fashion.
Future project designs should re-consider this element to allow improved coordination and thereby an
even more effective project.

     It would also be useful if social tracking of the workers taking VRS could be conducted.
     This would help provide additional guidance on how retired workers can be better fitted
      for a "post-SOE" life. Thus it could provide input for the Government's strategy for a
     retrenchment exercise in future. The review team would therefore encourage BRAC and
    the Government to disseminate/promote methods and results of this project widely within
