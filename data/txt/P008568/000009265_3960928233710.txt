MEMORANDUN AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT
OF THE INTERNATIONAL BANK FOR RECONSTRUCTION AND DEVEOPMMET
TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS
ON A PROPOSED LOAN TO THE
POLISH OIL AND GAS COMPANY
WITH THE GUARANTEE OF THE REPUBLIC OF POLAND
FOR AN ENERGY RESOURCE DEVELOPMENT PROJECT
1.    The following memorandum and recommendation on a proposed loan to the
Polish Oil and Gas Company (PGNG) in the amount of US$ 250 million equivalent
is submitted for approval. The proposed loan would be on standard IBRD terms
with 17 years maturity including five years of grace and would help to finance
increased production of natural gas. Cofinancing in the amount of US$ 60
million equivalent would be provided by the European Investment Bank (EIB).
2.    Background.  The Polish energy sector contributes 5% of employment, 13X
of GDP and 12% of total exports through the export of hard coal. Coal exports
are decreasing due to declining production and the high level of energy
intensity of the Polish economy. Energy production and energy conservation
have long been constrained by: (a) the policy framework within which
enterprises operated, including price distortions, soft budgets and central
administration interference; and (b) technical constraints, in particular
outdated technology and lack of access to imported equipment and intermediate
inputs due to a chronic shortage of foreign exchange.
3.    The Polish Government initiated on January 1, 1990 a package of measures
aimed at moving rapidly towards a market economy. A comprehensive
macroeconomic stabilization program was agreed upon with the Bank and the
Fund. High priority is being accorded to reducing sharply the rate of
inflation, mitigating the country's severe external debt problem and beginning
the process of restoring Poland's creditworthiness. Deposit and lending
interest rates were liberalized and are now positive in real terms. A unified
exchange rate was introduced, and most administrative price controls were
removed. While prices on most forms of energy are still controlled, they were
increased by 350%-600X on January 1, 1990; however, they are still
significantly below international levels. Domestic coal prices to industry
are in the 29-39% range of their quality adjusted export price levels, while
coal prices to households are in the 43-63% range. Other household energy
prices may need to be increased by factors ranging frow 7.5 times (for
electricity) to around 20 times (for gas and heat). Direct and hidden
subsidies to both energy producers and consumers remain.  Relative energy
prices are highly distorted in comparison with the patterns observed in nearby
market economies. Coal plays a much larger role in domestic consumption than
is justified by economic considerations, particularly when environmental costs
are taken into account. The transition towards a market economy should be
accompanied by a major shift in energy consumption towards gas and oil.
4.    Bank support to Poland's energy sector started in 1986 with a
comprehensive review of the sector. Since then, joint reviews have resulted
in a deepened understanding of the major issues facing the sector and in
recommendations for urgently needed reforms. The insights gained provide the
basis both for the proposed project as well as for planned future projects in
other parts of the energy sector.



5.    Bank Strate   and Rat oale for  ank I vo -ement   The Bank's overall
strategy and long-term objective in Poland is to support the Government's
reform program and related efforts to improve the efficiency and productivity
of the economy.  Bank involvement also focuses on helping to improve the
balarce of payments and the country's creditworthiness.  The Bank's and the
Gove_nment's strategy in the energy sector aims at improving energy-related
convertible currency earnings and significantly reducing environmental
pollution in Poland.
6.    Bank assistance would support the Government's program consisting of
energy pricing reform, energy conservation and fuel-switching from coal to gas
and oil. This is desirable not only for economic reasons but also as an
essential part of an effective strategy for environmental protection.  The key
next steps are: (a) progressive elimination of all energy subsidies; (b) a
move towards domestic energy prices that are broadly in line with
international energy prices; (c) increased domestic production of gas; (d)
increased efficiency in the energy sector, in part through restructuring of
sectoral institutions; and (e) increased private sector participation in
developing energy resources.
7.    The sector assistance strategy to be implemented through the proposed
Energy Resource Development Project and the associated ESMAP program
incorporates the following principal elements: (a) assisting in financing
measures to increase production and distribution of natural gas as a hard coal
substitute; (b) encouraging energy conservation and efficiency through
assistance in designing and implementing an appropriate energy pricing policy,
detailing the specific steps to be taken regarding realignment of industrial
and household gas prices, and preparing a gas development plan and
environmental assessment of gas use; (c) enhancing efficiency in energy
production and conversion through the development and implementation of energy
sector restructuring programs; and (d) providing direct assistance in
developing a contractual framework for private sector participation in the oil
and gas sector.
8.    Continued progress in energy price reform is also part of the dialogue
under the Bank's proposed first Structural Adjustment Loan (expected to be
presented to the Board during calendar year 1990), which would provide a
general framework for subsidy removal and a managed transition towards parity
with international prices in the energy sector.  A proposed series of future            0
energy efficiency projects would further support implementation of the
recommendations of the energy sector restructuring studies and improved energy
efficiency and environmental performance in the main energy conversion
industries (electric power, district heating and oil refining) as well as in
the main energy consuming industries.
9.          Project Description.  The project comprises the following major
components: (a) investments in eguipment and materials to increase the
production of natural gas. This would cover development and rehabilitation of
existing gas fields, gas compression, and delineation and evaluation of gas
fields discovered in recent years; expansion of transmission and storage
facilities to transport the additional gas and respond to load fluctuations;



HEMORANDUM AND RECONKENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT
OF THE INTERNATIONAL BANK FOR RECONSTRUCTION AND DEVELOPMENT
TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS
ON A PROPOSED LOAN TO THE
POLISH OIL AND GAS COMPANY
WITH THE GUARANTEE OF THE REPUBLIC OF POLAND
FOR AN ENERGY RESOURCE DEVELOPMENT PROJECT
1.    The following memorandum and recommendation on a proposed loan to the
Polish Oil and Gas Company (PGNG) in the amount of US$ 250 million equivalent
is submitted for approval. The proposed loan would be on standard IBRD terms
with 17 years maturity including five years of grace and would help to finance
increased production of natural gas. Cofinancing in the amount of US$ 60
million equivalent would be provided by the European Investment Bank (EIB).
2.    Background.  The Polish energy sector contributes 51 of employment, 13X
of GDP and 121 of total exports through the export of hard coal. Coal exports
are decreasing due to declining production and the high level of energy
intensity of the Polish economy. Energy production and energy conservation
have long been constrained by: (a) the policy framework within which
enterprises operated, including price distortions, soft budgets and central
administration interference; and (b) technical constraints, in particular
outdated technology and lack of access to imported equipment and intermediate
inputs due to a chronic shortage of foreign exchange.

significantly below international levels. Domestic coal prices to industry
are in the 29-39X range of their quality adjusted export price levels, while

basis both for the proposed project as well as for planned future projects in

5.    Bank Strategy and Rationale for Bank Involvement.  The Bank's overall
strategy and long-term objective in Poland is to support the Government's
reform program and related efforts to improve the efficiency and productivity
of the economy.  Bank involvement also focuses on helping to improve the
balance of payments and the country's creditworthiness.  The Bank's and the
Government's strategy in the energy sector aims at improving energy-related
convertible currency earnings and significantly reducing environmental
pollution in Poland.
6.    Bank assistance would support the Government:s program consisting of
energy pricing reform, energy conservation and fuel-switching from coal to gas
and oil. This is desirable not only for economic reasons but also as an
essential part of an effective strategy for environmental protection.  The key
next steps are: (a) progressive elimination of all energy subsidies; (b) a
move towards domestic energy prices that are broadly in line with
international energy prices; (c) increased domestic production of gas; (d)
increased efficiency in the energy sector, in part through restructuring of
sectoral institutions; and (e) increased private sector participation in
developing energy resources.
7.    The sector assistance strategy to be implemented through the proposed
Energy Resource Development Project and the associated ESMAP program
incorporates the following principal elements: (a) assisting in financing
measures to increase production and distribution of natural gas as a hard coal
substitute; (b) encouraging energy conservation and efficiency through
assistance in designing and implementlng an appropriate energy pricing policy,
detailing the specific steps to be taken regarding realignment o industrial
and household gas prices, and preparing a gas deve'lopment plan   d
environmental asEessment of gas use; (c) enhancing efficiency    energy
production and conversion through the development and implemen.  ;-on of energy
sector restructuring programs; and (d) providing direct assistance in
developing a contractual framework for private sector participation in the oil
and gas sector.
8.    Continued progress in energy price reform is also part of the dialogue
under the Bank's proposed first Structural Adjustment Loan (expected to be
presented to the Board during calendar year 1990), which would provide a
general framework for subsidy removal and a managed transition towards parity
with international prices in the energy sector.  A proposed series of future
energy efficiency projects would further support implementation of the
recommendations of the energy sector restructuring studies and improved energy
efficiency and environmental performance in the main energy conversion
industries (electric power, district heating and oil refining) as well as in
the main energy consuming industries.
9.          Project DescriRtion.  The project comprises the following major
components: (a) investments in equiRment and materials to increase the
production of natural gas. This would cover development and rehabilitation of
existing gas fields, gas compression, and delineation and evaluation of gas
fields discovered in recent years; expansion of transmission and storage
facilities to transport the additional gas and respond to load fluctuations;



-3
and gas treatment and desulfurization facilities and technologies; and (b)
technical assistance through consultancy services, studies and staff training
to enhance management and production efficiency within the gas sector. The
loan proceeds would finance the direct foreign exchange costs of these items.
10.         Parallel to and in close association with the project, studies and
technical assistance would be performed and provided by ESMAP as follows: gas
and oil, power and lignite, district heating, and hard coal sector
restructuring studies; a gas development plan; a gas pricing study; and
technical assistance to develop the framework for joint ventures in the gas
and oil sector. Poland lacks an overall strategy for gas development and use.
The share of gas in total energy consumption could increase up to threefold
through the year 2000, due to the higher efficiency of gas and its favorable
environmental attributes. The gas development plan would address questions of
gas allocation, interfuel substitution, alternative supply options, net
environmental benefits, and optimal investment strategy and sequencing.
11.         In line with the Government's general policy regarding the private
sector, the proposed project would encourage domestic and foreigr private
sector ga:ticigation in the development of its oil and gas sector. The Bank
would provide through ESMAP direct support and assistance in the preparation
of an appropriate legal, fiscal and contractual framework for joint venture
activities in oil and gas exploration and development.  In addition, t:ivate
sector involvement in the gas sector is expected to increase as a result of
the gas sector restructuring program. If there is eventual divestiture of
manufacturing and service companies, a number of these companies could be sold
off to the private sector. The same results could follow, in varying degrees,
from the restructuring programs being undertaken in the other energy sectors.
12.         The proposed pr-ject was reviewed in che field on several
occasions by Bank environmental experts and consultants. In part as a result
of this close coordination, the proposed project fits well into the
environmental strategy being pursued by the Bank under the Environment
Management technical assistance project (Loan 3190-POL). The project is
expected to have a major positive environmental impact. The incremental gas
to be produced under the project would primarily displace hard coal used for
household space heating. This would result in a significant reduction of air
pollution (para 17).
13.         The total project cost is estimated at US$ 616 million equivalent,
with a foreign exchange component of US$ 320 million (52%). In additicn to
the proposed Bank loan of US$ 250 million, EIB would provide cofinancing in
the amount of US$ 60 million equivalent. A breakdown of costs and the
financing plan are shown in Schedule A. Amounts and methods of procurement
and the disbursement schedule are shown in Schedule B. A timetable of key
project processing events and the status of Bank Group operations in Poland
are given in Schedules C and D, respectively. A map and the Staff Appraisal
Report, No. 8343-POL, dated May 7, 1990 are also attached.
14.        Afgreed Actions.  The Government has agreed to the following
principal actions: (a) ensuring that, following the development of
restructuring programs for the gas and oil, power and lignite, district



heating and hard coal sectors, implementation of these programs would start by
June 30, 1991 after consultation with the Bank; (b) raising gas prices to
industry to average West-European industry gas price levels by December 31,
1992 in accordance with an agreed schedule and using a representative basket
of comparator countries; and (c) ensuring that, by December 31, 1991,
household gas tariffs would be set at levels not less than industrial tariffs.
Thereafter, household tariffs would be gradually increased to fully reflect
the additional deliverv costs of gas to houselholds by December 31, 1995. The
Bank would review, on a semi-annual basis, the measures proposed to be taken
by the Government to achieve the above targets.
15.         For the implementation of the project PGNG agreed notably to: (a)
achieve, starting with the year 1991, net internal cash generation ratios of
at least 30X in any one year based on a moving three-year average (the
previous, the current and the next year) during the project implementation
period, and maintain annual debt service coverage ratios of at least 1.3
times; and (b) review by December 31, 1991 its accounting treatment of
exploration expenses and bring it in line with international accounting
principles starting on January 1, 1992.
16.         Effectiveness of the EIB cofinancing agreement would be a
condition of effectiveness of the proposed loan.
17.         Benefits.  The project would result in a total increase in gas
production (high methane equivalent) by at least 30 billion ma and in
condensate production by 0.37 million tons through the year 2010, equival nt
to at least 36 million tons of hard coal. The maximum incremental annual
output would be 2.4 billion m3 of gas and 40,000 tons of condensate. The
economic rate of return of the project based on these benefits alone is
expected to be 37X. Most of the incremental gas output will be low in sulfur
and the project would finance installation of gas treatment and sulfur
recovery units. The project would also have major environmental benefits,
since it would encourage increased use of gas. This switch from coal to gas
will, on an annual basis, reduce air pollution in Poland by a minimum of
240,000 tons of ash, 50,000 tons of sulfur dioxide, 8,000 tons of carbon
monoxide, 20,000 tons of nitrogen oxide and 3,100,000 tons of carbon dioxide
during 1995-2010. Additional benefits would arise from the transmission
component of the project, which would result in reduced losses, and from the
technical assistance component.
18.         Risks.  In the short term, the main risk associated with the
project is the possibility of delayed gas price increases needed both to
ensure that consumers receive the proper economic signals as well as to
generate the necessary enterprise cash flow. This risk is manageable, given
the Government's commitment to energy price reform as evidenced in recent
energy price increases and its policy dialogue with the Bank. The market for
additional gas output is assured, since domestic demand far exceeds supply.
The market for Polish export coal is also assured; boiler specifications in
many West European countries are for Polish quality coal and demand continues
to exceed supply by a wide margin. Therefore, the project's economic risks
are low. Drilling risks (losing the well ard equipment during drilling) are
limited due to PGNG's experience and the introduction of modern equipment



-5-
under the project. Adequate training would be provided in the use of this
equipment.  Geological risks (the degree of probability of the ges being
present and producible in the expected quantities) are limited because the
infill wells would be drilled in producing fields with known gas
accumulations. Appraisal wells would be drilled near wells which have proven
the presence of a gas bearing reservoir. Development and rehabilitation of
existing fields is based on a thoroughly monitored field production history
without major operational difficulties. The risk of procurement delays beyond
the start-up period has been minimized by the establishment of a procurement
unit for the project, which received training by Bank staff, and effective
procurement monitoring arrangements.
19.         A longer-term risk stems from the ambitious program of adjustment
and stabilization that the Government is implementing. Wh'le the Government's
current plans are satisfactory, the major institutional and systemic reforms
are unprecedented and may take longer to implement than currently planned.
The Bank's on-going economic and sector work dialogue will be important in
helping to identify potential weaknesses in implementation of the reform and
to support the Government's overall economic policy reform program.
20.         Recommendation.  I am satisfied that the proposed loan would
comply with the Articles of Agreement of the Bank and recommend that the
Executive Directors approve the proposed loan.
