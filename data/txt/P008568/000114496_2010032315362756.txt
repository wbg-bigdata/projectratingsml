storage and transmission, including:
1.    rehabilitation of presently producing gas fields through
      upgrading of gas compression in four fields, infill and
      development drilling of about 250 additional wells, rehabili-
      tation of about 1,000 existing wells and installation of
      improved underground production equipment on producing wells;
2.    delineation and evaluation of discovered gas fields through
      appraisal drilling of about 40 wells and stimulation and
      production testing of about 35 wells;
3.    increasing the capacity of the gas transmission system through
      the installation and operation of additional compressor units,
      expansion of the Southern, South-western and North-eastern
      transmission networks by about 850 additional kilometers of
      pipelines and the conversion of an existing coke oven trans-
      mission network serving about 800,000 consumers to a network
      for the transmission and distribution of natural gas;
4.    expansion of underground gas storage capacity through the
      development of two additional storage caverns with about
      300,000 cubic meters capacity each and the installation and
      operation of the necessary surface facilities, including
      compressor units and transmission pipelines to connect said
      caverns to the gas transmission system; and
5.    installation of gas treatment and desulfurization facilities.
Part B:
      Provision of a suitable computerized supervisory control and
data acquisition system to be utilized in the development and
application of an optimum operational mode for the gas transmission
system to reduce system losses.
Part C:
      Performance evaluation of pilot plants for gas desulfuriza-
tion.
Part D:
(1)   Provision of studies to: (a) assess the technical feasibility
and prepare designs for the importation of liquified natural gas;
(b) introduce a suitable management information system; and (c)

      Thereafter, withdrawal from the Loan Account of the remaining
unwithdrawn amount of the Loan allocated to the eligible Categories
shall follow such procedures as the Bank shall specify by notice to
the Borrower. Such further withdrawals shall be made only after and

Bank, the Borrower shall, promptly upon notice from the Bank: (A)
provide such additional evidence as the Bank may request; or (B)
deposit into the Special Account (or, if the Bank shall so request,

shall otherwise agree, no further deposit by the Bank into the
Special Account shall be made until the Borrower has provided such
evidence or made such deposit or refund, as the case may be.
      (b)   If the Bank shall have determined at any time that any
amount outstanding in the Special Account will not be required to
cover further payments for eligible expenditures, the Borrower
shall, promptly upon notice from the Bank, refund to the Bank such
outstanding amount.
