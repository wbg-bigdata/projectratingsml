MEMORANDUM TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS AND THE PRESIDENT
SUBJECT:    Project Completion Report on Panama
Sixth Power Proiect (Loan 2313-PAN)
Attached is a copy of the report entitled "Project Completion Report
on Panama - Sixth Power Project (Loan 2313-PAN)" prepared by the Latin America
and the Caribbean Regional Office.
Implementation of the project coincided with a major deterioration
of the sector's management and finances, itself the result of the country's
severe macroeconomic difficulties. The project was only 58x completed and $18.7
million of the $32.1 million loan was cancelled as a result of the Bank's
suspension of disbursements on all loans to Panama (due to mounting arrears). The
project failed to achieve most of its objectives and is rated unsatisfactory. Its
long-term sustainability is uncertain as it depends on a major restructuring of
the sector. Rising losses, inadequate cost recovery, cumbersome procurement
procedures and Government interference in Borrower operations have yet to be
addressed conclusively.
The experience of this project also indicates that the Bank should
pay particular attention to staffing and union relations issues when designing
and implementing operations in Panama's power sector.
The Project Completion Report is comprehensive and informative but
has no Part II contributed by the Borrower or the Government.   No audit is
planned.

SIXTH POWER PROJECT
(LOAN 2313-PAN)
PREFACE
This is the Project Completion Report (PCR) for the Sixth Power Project in Panama,
for which Loan 2313-PAN in the amount of US$32.1 million equivalent was approved on June 9,
1983. The Borrower was the Instituto de Recursos HidrAulicos y Electrificaci&n (IRHE), which
provides electric service throughout Panama. About 42% (US$13.35 million) of the Bank loan was
disbursed. Loan disbursements were suspended in November 1987 due to Panama's failure to service
its debt to the Bank. On August 8, 1989, the undisbursed balance of the loan was canceled. The
loan helped fund completed works amounting to 58% of the original project and unfinished works
amounting to 4% of the original project.
Parts I and III of the PCR were prepared by the Infrastructure and Energy Division,
Country Department II, of the Latin America and the Caribbean Regional Office based on
information in Bank files, a final completion report and addenda on project progress prepared by the
Borrower, and discussions with Bank staff. As stated in Part II, IRHE and the Government reviewed
and had no comments on the PCR.

SIXTH POWER PROJECT
(LOAN 2313-PAN)
EVALUATION SUMMARY
1.        Project Description, Objectives, Cost, Completion Date, Institutional Issues. At
appraisal, the project was defined as including works for the rehabilitation of IRHE's subtransmission
and distribution networks and works for network expansion for the period 1984-1986, including
routine distribution extensions to connect new customers. The works consisted of lines and
substations at 115 kV, 34.5 kV, 13.2 kV and lower voltages and the installation of distribution feeders
and miscellaneous distribution equipment. The project also included technical assistance to carry out
an energy loss reduction study and the design of some underground lines (para. 1.17). The project
objectives were to: (a) permit IRHE to serve an expanded market, and (b) reduce energy losses
(paras. 1.15 and 1.16). The expected cost and completion date were, respectively, US$59.4 million
and December 31, 1986. Loan 2313-PAN (US$32.1 million) was expected to cover the foreign cost
of the project (US$32.0 million), plus the Bank front-end fee; IRHE was expected to finance all
remaining costs (US$27.4 million) (para. 1.18). At appraisal, the Bank did not forcefully address the
issue of excess personnel (para. 1.39); and during implementation, Government interference in
various management areas became an important issue (paras. 1.23 and 1.43).
2.        Actual Completion Date, Works Carried Out, and Cost. The date of project completion
is August 8, 1989 when, at the request of IRHE, the undisbursed balance of the loan (US$18.75
million) was canceled. About 58% of the original project, including feeder lines, substations, and
distribution networks, was completed, and an additional 4% of the original project remained
unfinished, but was later completed by IRHE with its own funds. The cost of completed and
unfinished works was about US$31.0 million.
3.          The above project completion date overstates the period of implementation, as progress
on the project had been almost completely suspended since early 1987 for lack of adequate
counterpart funding. In November 1987, the Bank suspended disbursements on all Bank loans to
Panama when the country stopped making debt service payments to the Bank.
4.        Implementation started in 1984, approximately one year late due to very slow approval
by Government of Bank loan documents. During the implementation period, 1984-1987, and later
years, various factors combined to delay the IRHE expansion program, including the project (paras.
1.22, 1.23 and 1.43). In particular, these factors included time-consuming procurement procedures,
increasing Government interference in IRHE's affairs, IRHE's poor management, its deteriorating
liquidity due to growing accounts receivable, a worsening economy and domestic and international
political problems. By 1989, as measured by increasing energy losses (23.6%), the project was not
successful in attaining loss reduction, a main objective; and sales levels were 25% below forecast
(para. 1.26).

5.         Fmancial Performance. The financial forecasts covered the period 1983-1987. During
this period, tariff levels and revenues were satisfactory. During the longer period of 1981-1989,
IRHE's tariffs increased slightly: average revenue per kWh sold reached US cents 11.7/kWh in 1989
compared with US cents 10.9/kWh in 1981. The rate of return in 1989 was only 5.95% on revalued
assets compared with 9.25% in 1981. On average, IRHE's average revenue per kWh exceeded
estimated long-run marginal costs, which is unusual for a Latin American power utility, and indicative
that problems other than tariffs were at the root of IRHE's operational and financial difficulties
(para. 1.36).
6.         IRHE's mixed financial performance during the period 1983-1987 occurred within an
increasingly restricted financial and operating autonomy. Initially, net internal cash generation was
hampered by poor hydrological conditions which required higher-than-expected thermal generation
leading to higher-than-expected expenditures on fuel. Then, illiquidity due to rising accounts
receivable became a major financial problem, especially in 1988-1989; in 1982 accounts receivable
were equivalent to 67 days of sales and by 1989, they had reached the equivalent to 217 days, mainly
because of slow payment by the public sector (paras. 1.34 and 1.36). Also, adversely impacting on
IRHE's financial performance were high levels of energy losses and wage expenses (paras. 1.38 and
1.39).
7.         Performance. In judging the two main parties responsible for implementing the project,
the Government and IRHE, it is primarily the Government which should be held accountable for
project non-completion. During the years 1988 and 1989, in circumstances of political confrontation
(domestic and international), worsening economic recession, and growing Government interference
in the affairs of IRHE, there was very little that either the Bank or IRHE could do to advance the
project. Indeed, by 1989, the Government, as a result of non-payment of its bills, restrictions on
IRHE's budget, complicated procurement regulations, frequent management changes, and
centralization of IRHE's cash flow in the National Bank, had effectively eliminated IRHE's
operational and financial autonomy, thereby contributing to the non-completion of the project.
However, in the years prior to 1988, IRHE had the opportunity to advance the project substantially,
but did not, due primarily to the deterioration in the quality of IRHE's management, frequent
changes of its executives, and cumbersome procurement procedures. At times, it took in excess of
one year to obtain approval to award a contract (paras. 1.42 to 1.44).
8.         Lessons to be Learned. The main lesson to be learned is that during project preparation
and appraisal, the Bank should be more forceful in addressing institutional issues such as staffing
levels and in seeking improvements on the part of the Borrower's management, especially when
indications are that the project is being delayed because of management failings (para. 1.49), and that
there should be agreement between the Borrower, the Government and the Bank as to what
constitutes appropriate procurement procedures. In countries where these procedures stand in the
way of economy and efficiency, the country dialogue should raise this as an issue for Bank lending
in general and seek to promote mutually acceptable improvements.

PART I: PROJECT REVIEW FROM THE BANK'S PERSPECTIVE
A.        Project Identity
1.1.      Name:                 Sixth Power Project
Loan Number:          2313-PAN
Amount:               US$32.1 million
Canceled:             US$18.75 million
Year of Approval:     1983
Closing Date:         June 30, 1989
Borrower/Beneficiary:   Instituto de Recursos Hidriulicos y Electrificaci6n (IHRE)
RVP Unit:             LA2EI
Country:              Panama
Sector:               Electric Power
B.        Sector Background
1.2.      Bank Lending. Since 1962, the Bank made seven loans to the national power company,
Instituto de Recursos Hidriulicos y Electrificacidn (IRHE) totalling US$255.4 million (Part III, Table
1), including Loan 2313-PAN (1983), which helped finance the project covered by this report.
1.3.      The first loan helped finance a rural electrification program; the second, third and fourth
loans helped finance hydroelectric and thermo-electric expansion (533 MW) and associated
transmission. The fifth and sixth loans helped finance subtransmission and distribution projects, and
the seventh loan was expected to finance the expansion of the Fortuna hydroelectric plant.
1.4.      The first five loans contributed to improved sector organization and planning, and
facilitated the inflow of foreign commercial and bilateral financing. Bank lending also assisted IRHE
and the Government to implement tariff policies aimed at maintaining electricity prices in line with
the long-run marginal cost of supply and at providing investment funding on terms appropriate to a
public utility.
1.5.      Supported respectively by Loans 322-PAN (1962),661-PAN (1970) and 949-PAN (1973),
the first three projects were successfully completed, notwithstanding some delays and cost overruns.
Loan 1470-PAN (1977) helped finance the Fourth Power Project (Fortuna hydroelectric plant, also
called Fortuna I). Due to poor geological conditions which were undetected during execution of the
feasibility studies, completion of the Fortuna hydroelectric plant was delayed sixteen (16) months, and
there was a cost overrun of 93%, which the Bank and the Inter-American Development Bank (IDB)



-2 -
helped finance through supplemental loans. Commercial operation of the Fortuna plant started in
1984.
1.6.        With partial financing from  Loan 1778-PAN  (1980), the Fifth Power Project, a
subtransmission and distribution project, was completed with a delay of three (3) months and a cost
overrun of about 55% due to an increase in the scope of the project and higher-than-expected local
costs.
1.7.        Loan 2313-PAN (1983) helped finance the Sixth Power Project, a subtransmission and
distribution project, which was not completed as originally planned mainly because of the severe
political and economic disruptions in Panama between mid-1987 and 1989. These disruptions were
compounded by internal management and financial problems at IRHE and resulted in a rate of
electricity demand growth much lower than originally expected.
1.8.        In 1990 IRHE requested the cancellation of Loan 2506-PAN (1985), which would have
helped IRHE finance Fortuna IL a project designed to increase storage capacity, thereby permitting
additional average hydro generation of about 247 GWh per annum. Underlying IRHE's request for
cancellation was its decision to execute the project under procurement arrangements which were
incompatible with Bank procurement guidelines; the project is now under construction with IRHE's
own funds.
1.9.        Disbursements from all active Bank loans to Panama were suspended in November 1987
because of Government failure to service its debts to the Bank. Relations were normalized in March
1992 when the Board approved an Economic Recovery Loan.
1.10.       Organization and Regulation. IRHE, an autonomous Government agency created in
1961, is solely responsible for public service electricity supply, except for the supply to the Canal
Zone and adjacent areas, which have their own generating system. The system of the Canal Zone
is interconnected to the IRHE system. IRHE acquired several small private companies between 1961
and 1971: the CompafiIa Panamefia de Fuerza y Luz (FyL) in 1972--the largest utility in the country,
serving Panama City and Colon; the Empresas El6ctricas de Chiriqui in 1973--the second largest
privately owned utility; and other small companies in 1976 and 1978.
1.11.       Besides setting company policy, the IRHE Board of Directors is also in charge of power
sector policies. There is no separate regulatory body for the sector. Electricity tariffs are approved
by the Cabinet on the recommendation of the IRHE Board and by the Economic Cabinet.Y IRHE's
annual budget is subject to approval by the Economic Cabinet. Govemment involvement (and
increasing interference during the period 1983-1989) in various aspects of management suggests that
IRHE's "autonomy" was more nominal than real.
1/   The Economic Cabinet (Gabinete Econ6mico) created by executive Decree of November 25, 1983 is chaired
by the Minister of the Presidency of the Republic, who represents the President, and incLudes the
Minister of Planning and Economic Policy, the Minister of Finance and Treasury, the Minister of
Connerce and Industry, the Controller GeneraL of the Republic, the General Manager of the National
Bank of Panama, and the GeneraL Manager of the Caia de Ahorros (Govermnent savings bank).

1.12.      IRHE and the national power company of Costa Rica, Instituto Costarricense de
Electricidad (ICE), signed a system interconnection agreement early in 1982, setting forth the basis
for energy exchanges and pricing, and for the programming and financing of the interconnection
facilities. The interconnection was financed by the Bank under Loan 1778-PAN and by the IDB, and
is benefiting both countries, permitting the exchange of up to 100 MW in an emergency and using
secondary hydroelectric energy available in Costa Rica and other neighboring countries to replace
thermal generation in Panama. The interconnection facilities were commissioned in March 1986.
C          Objectives and Description
1.13.      Origin. Preparation of the Sixth Power Project began in August 1982 when IRHE
presented to the Bank technical, economic and cost information on the proposed project and
requested financing. The proposed project was the second stage of the distribution program initiated
under the Fifth Power Project (Loan 1778-PAN); and the distribution program was part of a larger
Master Plan covering the years 1980-2000. The second stage of the distribution program covered the
years 1984-1986, while the first stage covered the years 1980-1983.
1.14.      By agreement between IRHE and the Bank and in consideration of the financial
difficulties of IRHE, the Sixth Power Project was given priority over the Fortuna II project, as
preparations for this project were delayed from mid-1982. These difficulties were partially due to the
cost overrun on the Fortuna plant (para. 1.5).
1.15.      Objectives The project was an integral part of the IRHE expansion plan and shared
its objectives: (i) installation of least-cost capacity additions to supply demand growth; and (ii)
improvement of system reliability to secure a loss of load probability of two days per year as a
maximum. According to the Staff Appraisal Report (SAR) for the Sixth Power Project: "The various
components of the project would provide the means of energy distribution to meet the projected load
growth. The rehabilitation of obsolete systems and the addition of distribution transformers and
capacitors would reduce losses and improve the quality of service. However, overall improvement
to energy losses will be moderate in view of the expected increase in transmission losses when the
Fortuna project is connected at the extreme [end] of a long transmission line in 1984." V
1.16.      When completed, the project would permit IRHE to serve its expanding market and to
reduce energy losses to a reasonable level. In 1987, the year after project completion, the following
achievements were expected: energy sales of 2,335 GWh, representing an annual growth rate of
6.75% over the level of 1982 of 1,672 GWh; customers numbering 314,000, representing an increase
of 60,000 over 254,000, the level of 1982; and energy losses of 15.4% down from 17.0% in 1982.
1.17.      Description and Cost. At an expected cost of US$59.4 million, the project would include
works for the rehabilitation of subtransmission and distribution networks, and works for network
expansion during the period 1984-1986, including routine distribution extensions to connect new
consumers, plus a technical assistance component. The works would consist of lines and substations
at 115 kV, 34.5 kV, 13.2 kV and lower voltages and the installation of distribution feeders and

miscellaneous distribution equipment; the expected cost of this component was US$58.4 million. The
technical assistance component would consist of an energy loss reduction study and the design of
some underground lines, and would cost US$ 1.0 million. Most of the distribution components were
to be completed by December 1984; the substation components and the subtransmission lines, by
December 1986. The project completion date and the loan closing date were set at December 31,
1986 and December 31, 1987, respectively.
1.18.      Fnancing. To finance the expected project cost of US$59.4 million, the Bank would
provide a loan amounting to US$32.1 to cover the foreign exchange component, US$32.0 million, plus
the Bank's front-end fee; and IHRE would provide US$27.4 million to cover local costs. The Bank
loan would have a term of 15 years.
1.19.      Loan Processing Tunetable. Project preparation and loan processing moved swiftly.
Bank staff appraised the project in October and November 1982. Negotiations were held on May
2-5, 1983. Board approval occurred on June 9, 1983; representatives of the Bank, IRHE and the
Government signed the Loan and the Guarantee Agreements on September 20, 1983. The loan
became effective on March 12, 1984. The delayed effectiveness was due to the very slow process of
Government approvals of Bank loan documents (Part III, Table 2).
1.20.      Project Design. IRHE designed the project which was part of a Master Plan for
expanding the subtransmission and distribution systems to meet a load forecast for the years 1982-
1993. Since the objective of the Master Plan was to provide electric service to new customers and
to improve or replace existing facilities, alternatives were limited. However, where applicable, IRHE
carried out economic comparisons to make least-cost selections. At appraisal, in the opinion of the
Bank: (i) the technical work (planning and design) of IRHE was satisfactory; and (ii) the timing of
the project was appropriate.
1.21.      Experience with previous projects had shown that the roles and responsibilities of the
major parties to the project -- IRHE, the Government, and the Bank -- were clearly defined and well
understood. Therefore, it was reasonable for the Bank to expect such understanding in connection
with the Sixth Power Project. As explained in the report (paras. 1.23, 1.42 andl.43), the Government
altered its role and that of IRHE by increasingly limiting the operational and financial autonomy of
IRHE, especially with respect to procurement. For all contracts worth US$250,000 and above, local
procurement legislation provided for successive review and approval of bid documentation, bid
evaluation, and contract awards by the Board of Directors of IRHE and by three Government bodies:
the Cabinet, the Economic Cabinet, and the Controller. Prior to 1984, this approval procedure
normally took less than four months, but thereafter, as the Government subjected the operations of
IRHE to ever closer scrutiny, this procedure took more and more time, finally extending to a period
of twelve months and more.3' Prepared in 1986, the PCR for the Fifth Power Project (Loan 1778-
PAN), a prior transmission and distribution project, identified the cumbersome review and approval
requirements of Panamanian legislation as a source of delay 4, but evidently this development
occurred in the later stages of project execution (1984 and thereafter) because at the time of

appraisal of the Sixth Power Project (October-November 1982), the review and approval procedure
was not judged as requiring special remedial measures.
D           Implementation
1.22.      Completion Date and Works Carried OuL At appraisal, it was expected that the project
would be carried out during the years 1983-1986 and the project completion date would be December
31, 1986. The actual implementation period was 1984-1987; and the actual project completion date
was August 8, 1989 (para. 1.25). As of that date, work on the project had been almost completely
suspended since early 1987 for lack of adequate counterpart funding, even before the Bank decision
in November 1987 to suspend disbursements on all loans to Panama (para. 1.9). As shown in
Schedule 1, the value of completed works amounted to about 58.2% of the original project cost,
including: 5.7%, specific transmission and distribution works; 43.0%, routine general distribution
expansion; and 9.5%, improvements to the existing distribution system (for details, see Part III, Table
3). Including unfinished items, works carried out constituted about 62.5% of the original project cost.
The unfinished items were later put into operation by IRHE, using their own funds.

1.23.      Sources of Delay. Actual physical execution of the transmission and distribution works
began in 1984, about one year after loan approval -- a delay caused by the late loan effectiveness due
to slow Government approval of Bank loan documents. In the years 1984-1987, implementation was
delayed due to the excessive time required to obtain Government approvals needed to issue bid
documents and for subsequent contract awards (para. 1.21). This multi-step review and approval
process led to long delays in contract award, delays so extended that sometimes the validity of the
offer would expire by time of approval. A declaration of misprocurement on several contracts was
recommended after extremely long periods of inaction/indecision of up to 430 days. In some cases,
a source of delay was disagreement between Panamanian law and Bank procurement policies on
bidding procedures. Prior to 1984, the local review and approval procedures had not been an
important source of delay.
1.24.      Cost. The cost forecast at appraisal was US$59.4 million, but the actual project cost as
implemented amounted to US$31.0 million, of which US$13.3 million was the foreign exchange cost
financed by Loan 2313-PAN and the balance, US$17.7 million, were local currency costs financed by
IRHE. Given the incomplete state of project completion in 1989, actual and forecast costs are not
comparable. The actual project cost (US$31.0 million) amounted to about 52.2% of the appraisal
forecast (US$59.4 million) (for details, see Part III, Table 4).
1.25.      Changes to Closing Date, Allocations of Loan Proceeds and Timing of Disbursements
The original loan closing date was extended by two years to June 30, 1989, upon the request of
IRHE, to provide additional time to complete the project and to permit full disbursement of the loan.
IRHE was unable to progress satisfactorily with the project as rescheduled. The last disbursement
was made on December 18, 1987 and virtually no disbursements were requested thereafter. Given
the many problems of the project, the Bank did not extend the final closing date beyond June 30,
1989. The completion date for the project was August 8, 1989 when the Bank, with IRHE's
concurrence, canceled the undisbursed balance of the loan, US$18.7 million, in accordance with
Section 2.04 of the Loan Agreement and Section 6.03 (D) of the General Conditions applicable to
Loan and Guarantee Agreements. Part III, Tables 5 & 6 compares actual and forecast data on
allocations of loan proceeds and the timing of disbursements.
E_         Results
1.26.      Objectives. At the time of project completion (August 1989), IRHE was meeting the
power demand of a shrinking market, but had failed to achieve the objective of reducing energy
losses. As shown in Schedule 2, by 1986, the expected date of project completion, actual and forecast
levels of sales and numbers of customers were reasonably close; but there had been an increase, not
a reduction, in energy losses. A Bank supervision mission reported that for the year 1986 the
breakdown of causes losses were: transmission and distribution losses, about 15%; theft or fraud,
about 5%; and other causes (such as auto-consumption and unaccounted energy), for the balance of
1% to 2%.Y By 1989, sales levels had deteriorated to a level close to that of 1985 and energy losses
had further increased.

1.27.      Economic Justification. At appraisal, it had been expected that the project would
improve the quality of service through rehabilitation of subtransmission and distribution system
facilities and the additional expansion of the subtransmission and distribution system into new areas
to meet expected load growth, utilizing as much as possible the hydro energy available from the new
Fortuna hydroelectric plant. For all routine and specific subproject expansion, economic sizes of
conductors were studied and chosen using an 11% discount rate. Spare capacity at substations was
provided, based on then current consumption estimates plus approximately 25% reserve over the
estimated peak demand.
1.28.     The subtransmission and distribution program, of which this project was a part, was
designed by IRHE on the basis of load forecasts for the period 1982-2000. Actual data for the period
1983-1989 was examined for purposes of economic justification and compared with the justification
of the original 1983-1987 project.
1.29.     At the end of the 1983-1989 period, actual demand lagged the appraisal forecast by four
years due to a severe economic recession, largely linked to the Panama-US conflict although the
growth of the number of customers was close to the appraisal forecast. The actual average growth
rate for the period 1983-1989 was only 1.1% against the forecast rate of 6.75% (Part III, Tables 7
and 8a & 8b). The appraisal forecast appeared to be satisfactory when it was developed in 1983, at
which time it would have been impossible to forecast the political turmoil that was to come.
1.30.      Return on Investment. At appraisal, the internal return on the investment program for
1983-1987, of which the project was a part, was estimated at 13.4%. In computing the rate of return
for the actual investment program for the period 1983-1989, actual data for average incremental fuel
costs, average incremental operating and maintenance costs and incremental energy sales was used.
All costs and benefits were taken from the Bank supervision reports through 1987 and from the
IRHE Final Project Report. The internal financial return using the actual figures is 7.2%, about 46%
lower than the appraisal estimate of 13.4%, and about 35% lower than the 11% opportunity cost of
capital assumed for Panama (Part III, Table 9). The main reasons for the low return on the
investment program were:
a)   economic recession, resulting in actual levels of energy sales much lower
than expected at appraisal, in spite of an increasing number of customers;
and



-8-
b)   extremely high fuel expenses in the early years of the investment program,
caused by concurrent dry periods and delays in the commissioning of the
Fortuna hydroelectric plant.
1.31.      The return on investment as calculated, however, does not capture all the benefits to
society (i.e., consumer surplus).
F.         Fmancial Performance
1.32.      Actual and Forecast Data. The financial performance of IRHE during the years 1983-
1987 -- the expected period of project execution, plus one year -- was mixed (see Schedule 3 on the
following page, plus Part III, Tables 10 and 11). The most important financial problems of IRHE
during this period were higher-than-expected fuel costs and rising levels of accounts receivable. High
salary levels and overstaffing contributed to the mixed financial performance of IRHE (para. 1.39).
Other factors bearing on the financial performance of IRHE included poor financial management,
the economic recession, high levels of energy losses, and increasing Government interference in the
affairs of IRHE, including frequent management changes and loss of budgetary autonomy. In later
years, the Government further reduced the autonomy of IRHE by centralizing its cash flow in the
National Bank and by using the cash flow to finance other Government activities.
1.33.      For the years 1983-1987, actual and forecast summarized sales (9,826 GWh vs. 10,305
GWh), average revenue per kWh (US cents 12.77 vs. US cents 12.10), and operating revenues
(US$1,189 million vs. US$1,316 million) were reasonably close, but there was a shortfall (US$279.4
million or -32.5%) with respect to summarized gross internal cash generation due to rising fuel costs
and costs related to higher-than-expected electricity losses (para. 1.38). There was a partial offset
to the shortfall for gross internal cash generation due to lower-than-expected levels of debt service,
but summarized net internal cash generation (US$228.2 million) was US$155.3 million (or -40.5%)
less than expected. Expenditures for construction (US$372.0 million) and "other" (US$31.3 million)
were less than expected by, respectively, US$319.6 million (or -46.2%) and US$24.5 million (or
-43.9%). The shortfall in construction expenditures reflected the impact of Government budget
restrictions and lower market growth. The net change in working capital (US$116.1 million)
increased over the forecast level by US$88.8 million (or 325.3%), primarily because of increasing
levels of overdue accounts receivable, which reflected slow payment on the part of the public sector.
The total shortfall for applications, US$255.3 million, was matched by corresponding shortfalls for net
internal cash generation, US$155.3 million and borrowing, US$103.5 million, which shortfalls were
partially offset by a modest increase in equity contributions, US$3.5 million.
1.34.      The annual rate of return of 8.75% covenanted with the Bank was not met (see
Schedule 3 and para. 1.46); the actual ratio of summarized debt-service coverage was somewhat below
forecast levels: 1.6X vs. 1.8X. The same was true with respect to the self financing ratio: 55.5% vs.
61.3%. However the shortfalls for these ratios were not very significant as electricity tariffs were
maintained at a high level, above LRMC (para. 1.37); and the actual level of construction
expenditure, which was restricted by the Government, was well below what had been forecast
(US$372.0 million vs. US$691.6 million). The actual five-year average debt-equity ratio was a little
better than the forecast ratio (34/66 vs. 37/63). With respect to accounts receivable, IRHE
experienced serious deterioration: the actual five-year average for days outstanding (115) was well
above the forecast level (60).

- 10-
1.35.      During the years 1988 and 1989, while certain key ratios continued to indicate a mixed
performance, IRHE's finances were actually deteriorating at an alarming rate. In 1989, the rate of
return was 5.95% (as compared with 8.11% in 1982); the debt-service coverage ratio, 2.2(x); and the
self-financing ratio, 1251%. The abnormally high level of the self-financing ratio was due to the
halting of investment expenditure due to Govemment restriction.
1.36.      What was more important, however, was the growing level of overdue accounts
receivable and the increasing illiquidity of IRHE's finances. From an initial starting point in 1982 (67
days of sales), the level of accounts receivable increased to 97 sales days in 1983 and then to 217 sales
days in 1989 (or almost 60% of annual revenues), compared to the 60 days covenanted under the
loan agreement (Section 5.06). IRHE was unable to remedy this situation because the Govemment,
for political reasons, did not permit the suspension of service to customers with large overdue
balances. This situation, in turn, was one of the contributing factors to an increase in the level of
short-term borrowings. The public sector continued to be the worst offender with respect to late
payment. Underlying this deteriorating financial performance were the worsening economic situation,
deepening domestic and international political crises, and Government actions reducing the financial
autonomy of IRHE (para. 1.32). The Bank communicated its concern to IRHE and the Government
but in consideration of other non-project issues, took no remedial action (para 1.46).
1.37.      TarifEs. Average tariffs (including fuel clause adjustments) were equal to or higher than
the forecast levels in the years 1983-1987, declining to US cents 11.70/kWh in 1989. The additional
fuel costs in the early years of the period 1983-1987 were not entirely recovered through the fuel
surcharge. Nevertheless, tariff levels were satisfactory -- and this reflected the impact of Bank
conditionality in connection with prior loans.
1.38.      Energy Losses. Another factor that affected negatively IRHE's financing was the high
level of energy losses. For the period 1983-1987, the actual and forecast overall loss ratios were,
respectively, 20.5% and 15.5%, and between 1983 and 1989, the annual loss ratio increased from
18.1% to 23.6%. This increase reflected theft and rising technical losses due to the brisk reduction
of all investments in 1988 and 1989, including routine maintenance. In 1986, transmission and
distribution accounted for a loss ratio of 15%; theft and fraud, 5%; other causes, between 1% and
2% (para. 1.26).
1.39.      Wage BilL IRHE had (and has) excess personnel protected by a strong union. At
appraisal, the Bank was concerned about the adverse impact of overstaffing on IRHE efficiency and
productivity2. However, by agreeing to unambitious personnel targets, which IRHE easily achieved
(see Schedule 4), the Bank did not seek fundamental reform in this area. Considerations contributing
to this approach were the: (i) reluctance on the part of the Government and IRHE management
to confront the union; (ii) expectation that long-term growth, combined with agreed targets limiting
numbers of staff, would slowly improve efficiency; and (iii) growth depended on implementation of
the project and the expansion plan.
Z/ For example, in 1982 the number of customers served per employee was 47 in Panama as compared to 75 and
95 for the power sectors of Costa Rica and Ecuador, respectively.

G.               Sustainability
1.40.            Because the project, consisting of transmission and distribution works is an integral
part of IRHE's power system, the sustainability of the project depends on the sustainability of the
entire system. Currently, IRHE is still operating the system under sub-optional conditions; for
example, in 1990 and 1991, IRHE experienced increasing power outages and losses which reached
a record 25%. Without remedial measures, the sustainability of the project (and also IRHE's entire
power system) is open to question. To improve the performance of IRHE, the Government is
considering such options as: (i) a radical reorganization of the company and (ii) private participation
in new generating facilities.
HL               Performance
1.41.            Contractors & Consultants. IRHE used 19 contractors and one consultant firm
in carrying out the reduced project. Their performances were satisfactory up to the time when works
were halted. The energy loss analyses and engineering studies were completed satisfactorily; they
concluded that when (and if) the recommendations were implemented, the energy losses could be
reduced to 15%. The recommendations included improvements of the distribution network to control
technical losses and improvements of the commercial department to control theft and fraud.
However, no action has been taken and losses have increased (para. 1.40).
1.42.            IRHE  and the Government. In judging the two parties responsible for the project,
IRHE and the Government, the Government bears the greater responsibility for project non-
completion, as IRHE was (and to a large degree still is) an institution with little or no autonomy.
1.43.            In 1986, the original project completion date, the market conditions justifying the
project were present -- that is, actual and forecast sales levels were reasonably close, but losses
continued to be high. Nevertheless, IRHE had not completed the project, the cause being not the
financial performance of IRHE but political, economic, and procurement factors outside the control
of IRHE. Slow procurement was caused by: (i) slow review and approval IRHE's bidding documents
and contract awards by Government (para. 1.21); and (ii) Bank-Government disputes on bidding
procedures (para. 1.23).
1.44.            During the years 1988-1989, numerous changes of general managers at IRHE,
increased Government interference, macroeconomic problems, and continuing political problems,
including a looming confrontation between the Governments of Panama and the United States,



- 12 -
adversely affected the ability of IRHE to manage its operations and to fund its construction programs.
Management turnover and lack of forcefulness by management to address these issues with the
Government further contributed to poor results. Having little or no institutional autonomy, IRHE
was not in a position to effect corrections in its procurement procedures or the procedures required
by the Government. Bank staff continued to provide guidance and support to IRHE in matters
pertaining to implementation progress under the adverse situation described.
1.45.          After 1987, project completion slowed to a halt. Ensuring non-completion of the
project were Government actions depriving IRHE of its financial autonomy. Arrears in IRHE's
accounts receivable exceeded the covenanted 60 days for each of the years of the project
implementation, rising to 217 days in 1989. Compounding the accounts-receivable problems,
Government interference in IRHE went as far as ordering the centralization at the National Bank
of all the daily cash and revenues and requesting the Controller of the nation the approval of all
IRHE expenditures. Under these circumstances, there was little, if anything, IRHE could do to
advance the project.
1.46.          The Government and IRHE were in non-compliance with major covenants from
the initiation of the implementation period up to the time disbursements were canceled, particularly
those regarding construction program execution, rate of return, arrears and plant maintenance (Part
III, Table 12). Prior to 1987, when it suspended disbursements for all loans to Panama due to
Govemment failure to service its debts to the Bank (para. 1.9), the Bank's dialogue with Panama
focused increasingly on macroeconomic policy issues and debt service payment. The payments
problem was correctly perceived by the Bank as the most important issue in its relations to Panama.
In that context it was prudent not to suspend disbursements for non-compliance of project covenants.
Also bearing on this decision were such considerations as the limited autonomy of IRHE and the
likelihood that suspension would not have contributed toward compliance or advancement of IRHE's
expansion program.
1.47.          The Bank. At appraisal, the Bank did not address forcefully the institutional issues
affecting IRHE efficiency, including excess personnel (para. 1.39). In retrospect, this should be
judged as a failure of project design. In the case of Panama, staffing levels were (and are) an
important efficiency issue. There is no reason why customers should be burdened with the high tariff
needed to cover the wages of excess personnel; and the Bank should be prepared to address this issue
on a more forceful basis in the future.
1.48.          The level of supervision was appropriate (Part III, Table 13). During supervision,
Bank staff continually aided the implementation of the project by suggesting and stimulating actions
to resolve problems as they arose and responding quickly to IRHE's requests for clearances related
to implementation (para. 1.23). During supervision, there was not much that the Bank staff could
do to remedy the Government's interference in the operational and financial affairs of IRHE, except
raising it as an issue on various occasions, but to no avail.
1.49.          In 1988 and 1989, in circumstances of political confrontation (domestic and
international), worsening economic recession, centralization of cash flow into the National Bank and
elimination of IRHE's financial autonomy, the project was not completed (paras. 1.43 to 1.45). These
circumstances could not have been anticipated at appraisal; and they were outside the control of the
Bank. The Bank should not be faulted for having proceeded with a project that did not achieve its



- 13 -
objectives due to such circumstances. As for not enforcing various covenants, the Bank was wise to
be patient, given the larger issue of debt repayment (para. 1.46).
L               Lessons to be Learned
1.50.           In 1987 and prior years, IRHE could and would have completed the project, if
Government procurement regulations had not delayed start-up and implementation and if IRHE's
management had been more competent (para. 1.44). From this experience, the lessons to be learned
are that (a) during appraisal and supervision, the Bank should be more forceful in addressing
institutional issues (staffing levels, Government interference) and in seeking improvements on the
part of the Borrower's management when project delays are clearly attributable to management
failings; and (b) during project preparation and appraisal, there should be clear agreement between
the Bank, the Borrower, and the Government as to what constitutes appropriate procurement
procedures and that these procedures should not be changed without a satisfactory demonstration
of cause.

3.01                             IRHE to carry out the project with diligence and efficiency.

4.02                             IRHE to operate and maintain its plants, equipment and
property in accordance with public utility practices. (Failure
to properly maintain its thermal plants reduced full availability

timely payment of arrears owed to IRHE by municipalities and
autonomous agencies for past services according to payment
schedule satisfactory to Bank. (A program by the Government
to eliminate a small portion of the arrears in five years was
considered unsatisfactory.)
3.02 (b)                         Government shall take all actions within its power to cause its
municipalities and autonomous agencies to pay future debts to
IRHE promptly so that not more than 60 days of electricity

1/   During a Bank mission to Panama in March 1982, IRHE requested financing
of a continuation of the distribution expansion to cover the 1984-86
portion of IRHE's Distribution Master Plan, instead of the second stage
of the Fortuna Hydroelectric Project. Up to that time, the second stage
of the Fortuna Hydroelectric Project had been in the preparation stage
and was expected to be funded by the Sixth Power Project. The Bank did
provide financing for its construction later through Loan 2506-PAN.
