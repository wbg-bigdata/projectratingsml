PANAMA
SIXTH POWER PROJECT
1. THE SECTOR
Energy Resources
1.01      The main source of indigeneous commercial energy identified so far
in Panama is hydro energy. Instituto de Recursos Hidraulicos y
Electrificacion (IRHE) has investigated about 30 sites with a potential of
about 1,900 MW and an average generation of about 10,000 GWh per year (para.
4.02).   A pre-feasibility study prepared by IRHE with United Nations
Development Programme (UNDP) financing and the assistance of the consultant
C. T. Main (USA) shows that in the Changuinola and Teribe river basins there
are eleven feasible sites for power generation with a total capacity of about
1,500 MW, and an estimated annual generation of about 8,700 GWh. Also with
UNDP funds, the same consultant prepared the feasibility study for the
Changuinola II site, which would have a total capacity of 300 MW. The
Inter-American Development Bank (IDB) is considering to finance the initial
activities for this project, including the preparation of the final
engineering design and bidding documents by 1985, as well as the construction
of the access roads. Additionally, the consulting firm ACRES (Canada)
completed the feasibility study for the Tabasara hydro-project (220 MW, 1,000
GWh/year). Finally, under a Swedish Government grant, consultants are
preparing the feasibility study for the Esti project which would include the
installation of 120 MW and 500 GWh/year downstream of the existing La
Estrella and Fortuna projects.
1.02      Panama's geothermal resources would permit the installation of
about 400 MW, according to the results of preliminary investigations prepared
by Corporacion Minera de Cerro Colorado (CODEMIN), a Government-owned mining
company, and by IRHE, from 1971 to present, with UNDP and OLADE financing.
Most of the geothermal sites are located in the Chiriqui province, in the
areas of Anton, Calobre, Colorado and the Baru volcano. IRHE will contract
consultants to be financed by the Bank (para. 1.07) for the execution of
geothermal surveys in the most promising sites; the studies would be
completed in 1984.
1.03      Preliminary investigations executed by the Government show no
indication of petroleum resources. However, there appear to be potential
coal deposits in the provinces of Colon and Chiriqui, although no studies
have been made to determine coal characteristics and reserves.  As part of a
Bank financed Energy Assistance Project (Loan 1954-PAN), there are studies
underway to determine the exploitable petroleum and coal resources of the
country (para. 1.07). Completion of the studies is scheduled for 1984.

1.04      With USAID financing, IRHE is preparing preliminary studies for the
installation of 25 mini-hydro plants, which would have a total capacity of
about 1,000 kW. In the past, IRHE installed four plants of this kind (total
600 kW). Even though mini-hydros are not attractive in Panama because of
their high investment cost and low efficiency, sometimes they represent the
only feasible alternative to supply electricity to small communities. IRHE
is conducting experiments to utilize other renewable sources of energy such
as biomass, biogas, solar energy and firewood, although these sources are not
expected to contribute significantly to the country's energy supply in the
foreseeable future.
Energy Demand and Supply
1.05      Panama depends heavily on imported petroleum to meet its energy
requirements. Petroleum accounts for about 60% of Panama's total primary
energy supply. In 1981, petroleum imports amounted to 10.7 million barrels
at a cost of approximately US$361 million, or about 20% of all Panama's
imports that year. Petroleum is refined locally at Las Minas refinery, which
has a capacity of 100,000 bbl/day. Currently, about 56% of the imported
petroleum is re-exported mainly as diesel and fuel oil. Government policies
adopted in 1979 and an intense public campaign to conserve energy helped to
curb the use of petroleum products, resulting in a net decrease of 20% in its
use in the period 1979-81.. Retail fuel prices to consumers in October 1982
were as follows: Gasoline regular: B 2.18/gal; premium: B 2.32/gal;
Diesel-oil: B 1.40/gal.
1.06      As a consequence of Government policies, hydro energy has increased
its share in the country's total energy supply from 2% in 1977 to 10% in
1981.  In the same period, mainly because of the substitution of hydro for
thermal generation, the supply share of petroleum products for electric
generation decreased from 24% to 13% of gross energy supply. The following
table shows the country's gross energy consumption by supply sources for the
period 1977-81:

a/ 1 Tcal = 1.163 Gwh
Energy Planning
1.07      Comision Nacional de Energia (CONADE), created in 1980 as an
advising body to the President of the Republic, is in charge of investigating
and planning all matters related to energy supply and consumption in Panama.
It is headed by IRHE's Director General and operates with personnel of IRHE's
Planning Directorate. CONADE's Executive Board includes its Director, its
Technical Secretariat (IREE's staff) and delegates representing the President



- 3 -
of the Republic, the Minister of Planning and Economic Policy, the Minister
of Commerce and Industry and the Association of Panamanian Engineers. At
present, CONADE and the Ministry of Commerce and Industry are the executing
agencies for Loan 1954-PAN for US$6.5 million to the Government, covering
the following areas: (a) planning and organization of the energy sector;
(b) energy auditing and conservation; (c) cost analysis of energy
conservation and substitution; (d) investigation of petroleum, coal and
geothermal resources in the country; and (e) training and other studies.
Bank Participation in the Power Sector
1.08      Since 1962 the Bank has made five loans to IRHE totalling
US$172.3 million (Annex 1.1). The first four loans have helped to finance
hydroelectric and thermal expansion (533 MW) and associated transmission, and
the fifth loan is financing subtransmission and distribution across the
country. Bank participation has contributed to improve sector organization
and planning and has facilitated the inflow of foreign commercial financing
to the sector. Bank lending has assisted IRHE and the Government in their
efforts to implement tariff policies aiming at maintaining electricity prices
in line with long-run marginal costs and at providing appropriate generation
of funds to meet the sector investment requirements. The continued Bank
presence in the sector would be crucial to consolidate the sector's
organization and self-financing, and to attain, where justified, the
Government's goal of substitution of hydro for thermal generation of
electricity.
1.09      As detailed in the corresponding Project Completion and Audit
reports, the first three Power Projects financed under Loans 322-PAN (1962),
661-PAN (1970) and 948-PAN (1973) were successfully completed although with
some delays and cost overruns. In the execution of the Fourth Power Project
partly financed under Loan 1470-PAN, the construction of the Fortuna
hydroelectric plant encountered unexpected poor geological conditions which
will result in a delay of about 16 months and a cost overrun of about 73%.
The distribution project (Fifth Power Project), financed under Loan 1778-PAN,
is progressing satisfactorily, although with an expected cost overrun of
about 29% due mainly to higher than originally estimated local cost
increases.
1.10      The proposed US$32.1 million loan would be the sixth one to IRHE,
and would help finance a second stage of the rehabilitation and expansion of
distribution systems started under the Fifth Power Project.
Power Sector Organization and Regulation
1.11      IRHE, the autonomous Government agency created in 1961, is the sole
entity responsible for public service electricity supply in Panama, except
for the supply of the Canal and adjacent areas (para. 1.13). IRHE acquired
the Compania Panamena de Fuerza y Luz (FyL) in 1972, the Empresas Electricas
de Chiriqui in 1973, the Hidroelectrica de El Valle in 1976, and two small
power utilities in 1978: La Chorrera, formerly a privately owned company in
West Panama Province (about 3 MW), and Bocas del Toro, a municipal company
(less than 1 MW).



- 4 -
1.12      IRHE's Board of Directors is in charge of power sector policies
(para. 2.02). There is no separate regulatory body for the sector.
Electricity tariffs have to be approved by the Cabinet on the recommendation
of IRHE's Board and the Finance Commission 1/. IRHE's annual budget is
subject to approval by the Finance Commission. The covenant under Loan
1778-PAN which provides that it would be an event of default to make any
change in the electricity legislation affecting materially and adversely the
operations or financial condition of IRHE or the carrying out of the project,
has been maintained under the proposed loan.
1.13      The Canal facilities and adjacent areas are supplied by the Panama
Canal Commission which has an installed capacity of 176 MW. The systems of
the Canal Commission and IRHE are interconnected and exchange of power and
energy between the two companies is determined for economic and technical
reasons on a day-to-day basis; there is no formal power exchange contract.
In 1982 the Commission purchased from IRHE 16 GWh. Most of the residential
service to the Ancon and Cristobal areas is now provided by IRHE at standard
tariffs.
1.14      IRHE and the Instituto Costarricense de Electricidad (ICE), signed
early in 1982 a system interconnection agreement setting forth the basis for
energy exchange and pricing, and for the programming and financing of the
related facilities. The interconnection, scheduled for 1984, would benefit
both countries, permitting the exchange of up to 150 MW in emergencies and
secondary hydroelectric energy to replace thermal generation in Panama.
Power Tariffs
1.15      Government legislation enacted in 1958 allows IRHE to earn a
maximum rate of return of 8.75% on a rate base equal to net revalued assets
in operation plus a working capital allowance of three months revenues. A
covenant under Loan 1778-PAN establishes that IRHE's tariffs will be set to
allow 8.75% as a rate of return, starting in 1980. Actual figures were 8% in
1980, 9.25% in 1981, and 7.4% in 1982. This covenant has been retained under
the proposed loan. Fixed assets, including major works under construction,
will continue to be revalued yearly in accordance with a method satisfactory
to the Bank 2/.
1/ Chaired by the Vice President of the Republic and composed of the Minister
of Planning and Economic Policy, the Minister of Finance and Treasury, the
Controller General of the Republic and the General Manager of Banco
Nacional de Panama.
2/ The methodology agreed with the Bank provides for revaluation of assets
(including major works during construction) according to specified indices
for international inflation (Handy-Whitman indices) and local inflation
(composite index of IRHE's labor and materials costs).



-5-
1.16      IRHE applies a unified tariff structure to all its customers
throughout the country (Annex 1.2). It has been designed to discourage
excessive electricity consumption by residential customers with consumption
over 400 kWh/month (Annex 1.3). Present tariff structure provides for a fuel
surcharge clause designed to pass fuel price increases on to consumers
automatically.
1.17      As agreed under the terms of Loan 1470-PAN, IRHE, with the
assistance of SOFRELEC (France), prepared a tariff structure study based on
marginal costs of electricity (9 US/Kwh at consumer's level) Some of the
recommendations of the study have been implemented, i.e. a special tariff was
created for larger industrial customers. The study is being updated by IRHE
to determine the impact of the delay and overcost of the Fortuna project, not
known when the study was first prepared. The existing covenant under Loan
1778-PAN, which establishes that no power will be sold to bulk customers at
rates lower than the long run marginal cost, has been maintained under the
proposed loan.
Existing Facilities
1.18      IRHE's total installed capacity by the end of 1982 was 516 MW of
which 49% was hydroelectric capacity. The following table summarizes the
existing capacity in Panama by type of installation and ownership (see Annex
1.4 for details):
Installed Capacity in Panama - January 1983

1.19      By the end of 1982 the transmission system consisted of about
765 km of 220 kV and 115 kV lines interconnecting the regional systems and
the main power plants to the grid. The same year distribution systems
totalled about 4,500 km of 34.5 kV and lower voltage lines. Total capacity
in transformers by the end of 1982 was about 1,080 MVA at 220 kV and 115 kV,
and 890 MVA at 34.5 kV and lower voltages.

Electricity Consumption and Access to Service
1.20      Per capita consumption of electricity in Panama was 687 kWh in
1977, 753 kWh in 1979 and 801 kWh in 1981 3/. In 1981, 80% of the urban
population and 39% of the rural population, or 57% of the total population,
had access to electricity.  IRHE's goal is to increase those figures to 85%,
43% and 62% respectively by 1986. This reflects the Government's awareness
of the need to provide adequate public services to support the service
oriented economy of the country.
Rural Electrification
1.21      IRHE, with the assistance of the consultant ESIN (Argentina),
and IDB financing, prepared a five year rural electrification program. The
first stage of this program will be executed in the period 1983-85, at a
total cost of US$23.0 million, of which IDB will finance US$13.3 million.
The project includes 1,400 km of lines at 34.5 kV, and will serve 12,500 new
rural customers.
Sector Development
1.22      The main objectives of IRHE's expansion program are:
(a)  to meet electricity demand at least cost;
(b)  to integrate the small isolated systems into the regional systems;
(c)  to interconnect the regional systems through a high-voltage
national grid; and
(d)  to develop the country's hydro resources to meet the increase in
demand and to substitute high cost thermal generation.
1.23      IRHE's technical staff has acquired considerable experience in the
design, construction and supervision of power projects, some of which, like
the Fortuna hydro project, have presented difficult technical and financial
problems. Such experience has been complemented with formal training in and
outside the country and on the job training provided by consultants. As a
result IRHE's staff is technically prepared to meet most of the future
project requirements. However, consultants' services will still be required
for the design of large power plants, complex transmission systems and
substations and other highly specialized technical projects. The Bank's
presence in the power sector has been a decisive factor to encourage and
support IRHE's staff training in particular and institution building in
general.
1.24      IRHE is experiencing short-term financial constraints mostly
related to the Fortuna project cost overrun (para. 5.03). No major financial

and 43%; Peru 564 kWh and 36%.and Uruguay 1,209 kWh and 82% (Source:

constraints are anticipated for the long term, i.e. for the period 1983-88,
provided that financing to complete Fortuna is secured, and provided that
IRHE will continue obtaining the required 8.75% rate of return.
2. THE BORROWER
Background
2.01      The proposed borrower, IRHE, is an autonomous agency of the
Panamanian Government, created in 1961 for the purpose of planning,
constructing and operating, under exclusive basis, all power generation
r'equired by the country. Since IRHE's creation, the Government has purchased
the assets of other private utilities vesting them in IREE. Today the
institution i!::, the sole utility providing electrical energy to the entire
country, with the e-xeption of the area served by the Panama Canal Commission
(para. 1.13).
Organization and Administration
2.02      IRHE is reputed to have the best organization and staff among
public institutions in the country. IRHE is directed by a seven member Board
of Directors and a Director General. The Chairman is the Minister of
Planning and Economic Policy; other members are the Ministers of Agriculture
and of Commerce and Industry, and the representatives of the Association of
Industrialists, of the Banking Association, of the Society of Engineers and
Architects, and of IRHE's Labor Union. This Board composition has generally
proven to be satisfactory. IRHE's annual operating and investment budget
must be approved by the Government's Finance Commission (para. 1.12).
2.03      Administration is entrusted to the Director General, the Deputy
Director General and the Technical Director. The first two are appointed by
the President of the Republic, and the Technical Director by the Director
General.
2.04      IRHE's current organization (Annex 2.1) includes seven Directorates
of which three are for operations (Finances, Operations, and Engineering and
Construction) and four for support functions (Planning, Institutional
Organization, Computer Services, and Purchasing and Warehouses). It was
implemented as a result of an organizational and training program executed by
IRHE with the assistance of the consultant Gilbert and Associates, USA, with
Bank financing (Loan 1470-PAN). It is adequate for today's operation,
although some structural changes would be required in the near future to
facilitate delegation of authority and decision making as the system grows.
IRHE's management is addressing this problem.
2.05      Bank financing of organizational studies, training and consultant's
services, especially under the Fourth and Fifth Power Projects, has permitted
TRHE to achieve important goals such as: improvement of its organizational
structure, staff training at all levels, implementation of computer facil-
ities for billing, accounting and technical applications; implementation of
financial and load forecasting models; improving purchasing procedures and
management of warehouses; and improving coverage of risk insurance policies.



-8-
Employment
2.06      IRHE's total staff in December 1982, was 5,415 including permanent
and temporary employees, of which approximately 71% operate and administer
the power system across the country; the rest are in charge of the
engineering and construction activities for new projects and offer general
support to IRHE's staff. IRHE has 370 professionals with a University
degree, of which 267 are engineers. In the period 1979-81, the growth of
personnel has been higher than agreed with the Bank in the context of Loans
1470-PAN and 1778-PAN. At present IRHE has productivity indicators lower
than the average for similar utilities 4t. IRHE's management is conscious
of the problem, and took some important decisions on this issue: (i) freezing
of personnel hiring in 1982; (ii) decreasing IRHE's construction force by not
replacing construction personnel leaving the company; and (iii) establishing
that hiring of new personnel will be done only when justified and authorized
through the annual operating budgets. Although these are positive steps to
curb the problem, in view of the high incidence of personnel costs in IRHE's
power rates, during negotiations of the proposed loan IRHE agreed to limit
its personnel growth as established under agreed performance indicators
(para. 2.10).
Accounting and Auditing
2.07      IRHE has substantially improved its accounting procedures in the
last few years. As a result, monthly financial statements are now issued
within 30 days of their respective closing dates. IRHE's assets have been
revalued yearly since 1976 by a local independent consultant acceptable to
the Bank, under a methodology agreed with the Bank (para. 1.15).
2.08      Since IRHE is a Government autonomous agency, its accounts are
audited annually by the office of the Controller General of the Republic.
TRHE's annual external audit, required under previous Bank loans, has been
performed satisfactorily by Arthur Andersen and Co. since 1975. Under the
terms of the proposed loan, IRHE agreed to continue to engage qualified
external auditors to review its accounts yearly and to send to the Bank
audited financial statements, including the Auditor's recommendations, within
four months of the end of each fiscal year.
Billing and Collection
2.09      Within the context of the Fourth Power Project (Loan 1470-PAN),
IRHE, with the assistance of Gilbert and Associates (USA), established a
modern data processing system for customer billing and accounting. Monthly
bills are distributed by carriers and by mail, and within 20 days of receipt
customers should pay their bills at IRHE's offices or banks located through-
out the country. As of December 31, 1982, total accounts receivable were 18%
(about 67 days of billing) of total annual sales, which is higher than the 60
days agreed under previous loans, largely due to high arrears of public
entities. However, the problem is not serious since past experience shows
that the Government has always paid its arrears, often in lump sums.
4/ In 1982, one of the productivity indicators, the number of customers
served per employee, was 47 in Panama, as compared to 75 and 95 for the
power sectors of Costa Rica and Ecuador respectively.



-9-
Nevertheless, the relevant covenant under existing loan agreements which
limits accounts receivable to 60 days of billing has been retained under the
proposed loan.
Performance Indicators and Reporting
2.10      IRHE agreed to comply with and to inform the Bank quarterly on the
performance indicators shown in Annex 2.2 which have been discussed with IRHE
and define targets for improving its operating efficiency. IRHE also agreed
to inform the Bank whenever noncompliances with such targets are expected to
occur.  As in past loans, IRHE agreed to prepare and send to the Bank
periodic progress reports and such other reports as the Bank may reasonably
request, including a project completion report.
Insurance
2.11      IRHE carries acceptable insurance against risks arising from civil
liability, motor vehicle claims, fire, lightning, explosion, flood, accident
claims, and income loss due to equipment failure for specified plants,
warehouses and buildings. As a result of a rationalization of its practices,
IRHE now contracts its insurance policies with three companies through a
broker.
3. THE MARKET
Historical Market
3.01      IRHE's service area extends throughout the country and includes
rural areas and isolated villages. As provided in the Torrijos-Carter Canal
Treaty signed in 1977, IRHE is gradually assuming the service to residential
customers of the former Canal Zone. However, electricity supply for the
Canal operations and its military installations will continue to be provided
by the Canal Commission. At present, IRHE serves 57% of Panama's population,
equivalent to 1.1 million inhabitants. In the period 1970-80, in the areas
now served by IRHE, electricity consumption grew at an annual average of
8.8%. However, there has recently been a trend towards slower growth (i.e.
7.2% in 1977-82, and 6.9% in 1980-82) as a result of generation restrictions
in 1977 and 1978, a public campaign since 1979 directed by the Government to
save energy, and lately the economic recession.
The Forecast
3.02      IRHE has improved its load forecast models with the assistance of
consultants financed by the Bank. The most adequate model for Panama's
conditions appears to be one that considers both econometric and macroeco-
nomic inputs related to historical and projected data for consumption and
economic growth. Energy sales for the period 1982-90 are expected to grow at
6.75% per annum, which is lower than the 7.5% forecast for the same period
during the appraisal of the Fifth Power Project (Loan 1778-PAN). The



- 10 -
decrease reflects a slower economic growth for the country. 5/ Statistical
data and forecast of energy sales in Panama by consumption categories are
shown in detail in Annex 3.1 and summarized in the following table, which
shows that patterns of electricity consumption are not expected to change
substantially in the future.

3.03      The number of IRHE's customers grew from 210,000 in 1978 to
254,000 in 1982, and IRHE expects to serve 314,000 customers in 1987, a net
increase of 60,000. The proposed project would finance the distribution
expansion required to supply these new customers.
The Energy and Capacity Balances
3.04      The forecast energy and capacity balances are shown in Annexes 3.2
and 3.3, and graphically in Annexes 3.5 and 3.6. The forecast net generation
of IRHE's power plants (Annex 3.4) shows that thermal generation will be
greatly reduced after Fortuna becomes operational in 1984 (para 4.03).
4. THE PROGRAM AND THE PROJECT
Background
4.01      Up to 1976 Panama relied almost exclusively on thermal generation
to supply electric energy and, as a consequence, it depended heavily on fuel
imports.  After the commissioning of the 150 MW Bayano hydroelectric plant in
1976 and the 90 MW La Estrella-Los Valles hydro plant in 1979, IRHE
considerably reduced its thermal generation from 94% in 1975 to 41% in 1982.
In 1985, after the new Fortuna project is in service, almost all electricity
requirements will be met by hydroelectric plants.
5/ Constant GDP growth in real terms for Panama is now forecasted at 2%
average per year for 1983-85, as compared to approximately 5% forecasted
previously.



- 11 -
The Program
4.02      IRHE's generation expansion program aims toward three important
goals: (i) the substitution of hydro for thermal generation from a present
41% of thermal generation to nearly zero after the commissioning of Fortuna
in 1984; (ii) the installation of least cost capacity additions to supply
demand growth; and (iii) the improvement of system reliability to secure a
loss of load probability of two days per year as a maximum.   The present
generation expansion program for the period 1982-93 is based on a Master Plan
for 1982-2003, originally prepared by IRHE with the assistance of C. T. Main
(USA). The plan is periodically updated by IRHE's Planning Directorate. In
its latest revision, a total of eight alternative plans were considered,
combining in various arrangements the following projects: Fortuna II
(raising of the dam); Bayano 3 hydro (75 MW);- Changuinola I, II, III and IV
hydro (300 MW, 306 MW, 102 MW and 146 MW, respectively); Teribe I, II and III
hydro (237 MW, 76 MW and 124 MW); geothermal plant (110 MW); coal fired plant
(225 MW) and gas turbines (75 MW).
4.03      The least-cost expansion plan adopted by IRHE includes only
hydroelectric projects, except for a gas turbine plant (1982) constructed to
compensate for the delay of Fortuna. The existing thermal plants will be
kept operative as cold stand-by during average hydrological years, and will
operate to meet energy deficiencies during dry years and during a period of 4
years prior to the operation of the new Changuinola hydroplant in 1992. 6'
The program includes the following projects for the period 1982-93:
Generation
(a) Installation in Panama City of a 2 x 18 MW gas turbine plant (completed
in 1982).
(b)  Completion of the 300 MW Fortuna I hydroelectric project in October
1,984.
(c) Completion in 1987 of Fortuna II (raising of the dam to provide
additional firm energy).
(d) Installation of the third 75 MW generating unit at the Bayano
hydroelectric plant in 1990.
(e) Construction of the 300 MW Changuinola I hydro project for operation in
1992.
Transmission
(f) Completion of the 220 kV lines Fortuna-David in 1983.
(g) Interconnection with Costa Rica at 220 kV in 1984 (para. 1.14).
6/ IRHE is considering a rehabilitation program to improve the efficiency of
existing thermal plants as suggested recently by an UNDP sponsored energy
mission (para. 4.13).

(h) Construction of a high voltage tranmission system 7/ to connect the
Changuinola Project to the Panama metropolitan area.
Sub-transmission, Distribution and Other Projects
(i) Completion in 1983 of the sub-transmission and distribution projects
included in the Fifth Power Project (Loan 1778-PAN).
(j)  Execution of the proposed Sixth Power Project which would include mostly
distribution in the period 1983-86.
(k) Other routine expansion projects covering substations, sub-transmission
and distribution for the rest of the period up to 1993.
(1) Execution of the the first stage of the rural electrification program,
to be financed by IDB (1983-85), covering 1,400 km of primary voltage
lines (34.5 kV) to serve 12,500 new rural customers.
(m) General plant and miscellaneous investments.
4.04      The cost of the 1983-87 slice of the above construction program in
current prices, including interest during construction, is estimated at about
US$692 million, of which 41% would be local costs and 59% foreign costs
(Annex 4.1).
The Project
4.05      The Fifth Power Project now being executed (Loan 1778-PAN) included
a much needed rehabilitation and expansion of IRHE's sub-transmission and
distribution facilities across the country for the period 1980-83. Some of
the distribution networks under rehabilitation were over thirty years old,
obsolete and operated overloaded and with high losses. They were acquired
from privately-owned utilities as part of a Government policy to entrust to
IRHE the responsibility of the power business in the entire nation (para.
1.11). The project is progressing satisfactorily, although with a delay of
three months and a cost overrun in the local cost component due to higher
labor costs than anticipated at the time of appraisal (para 1.09).
4.06      The proposed Sixth Power Project is a part of IRHE's least cost
expansion plan. It has been included by the Government in the list of high
priority projects since its execution is essential to permit the expansion of
the power sector as planned by the Government. The project represents a
second stage of the program initiated under the Fifth Power Project, and
consists of the rehabilitation and expansion of IRHE's sub-transmission and
distribution systems for the period 1984-86. The various components of the
project would provide the means of energy distribution to meet the projected
load growth; part of the people who are

today without electric service, as well as large housing projects being
developed by the Institute of Social Security and the Ministry of Housing,
would be supplied with electricity. The rehabilitation of obsolete systems
and the addition of distribution transformers and capacitors would reduce
losses and improve the quality of service to residential, commercial and
industrial consumers. However, overall improvement to energy losses will be
moderate in view of the expected increase in transmission losses when the
Fortuna project is connected at the extreme of a long transmission line in
1984. Power would be supplied for the operation of the new pipeline between
Puerto Armuelles on the Pacific Ocean and Bocas del Toro on the Atlantic, now
depending on captive diesel power plants.  Postponement of the project would
cause economic problems to the industrial sector because of lack of electric
service, and to IRHE a loss of revenues, because of market growth limitations
and an increase in power losses, due to circuit overloads, with its
consequent economic losses and degradation of quality of service.
4.07      Design alternatives are sometimes limited because the proposed
project includes improvements to and expansion of existing systems.
Least-cost solutions were investigated for the main components such as
extension of existing substations and installation of new ones; routing of
transmission lines; location, dimensioning and type (aerial vs. underground)
of primary and secondary feeders; and location and dimensioning of
distribution transformers and capacitors.
4.08      The project, described in detail in Annex 4.2, consists of the
following components:
(a)  sub-transmission:  (i) installation of 65 km of 115 kV aerial
lines, 7 km of 115 kV underground feeders and 19 km of 34.5 kV
lines; and (ii) installation of 121 MVA of substation capacity at
115 kV and 34.5 kV;
(b)  distribution (13.2 kV and lower voltages):  installation of
(i) about 1,700 km of primary and secondary circuits; (ii) 40 km of
13.2 kV underground circuits; (iii) 3,200 distribu-ion trans-
formers, with a total capacity of 150,000 kVA; (iv) 9,000 street
lamps; and (v) 32,000 meters;
(c)  metering equipment:  installation in 35 substations of metering
equipment to be used for detailed load forecasting and energy
losses study (para. 4.13); and
(d)  consulting services:  design of a 115 kV underground feeder and
preparation of an energy losses study, requiring a total of 10
man-months.
Project Cost and Financing
4.09      The cost estimates for the proposed project which were prepared by
IRHE, based on actual costs of the Fifth Power Project, are reasonable. In
particular, costs were analyzed in depth to take into account recent
experience (para. 4.05). Base costs are expressed in January 1983 prices.
Local and foreign costs at the end of each year were obtained using the
following inflation indices:



- 14 -
1983    1984    1985    1986
Local Cost (%)            7.5    7.5       7.5      6.0
Foreign Cost (%)          8.0    7.5       7.0      6.0
The cost of IRHE's engineering and administration is estimated at 10% of
total base cost, in line with experience in recent similar projects. The
cost of the foreign consulting services (total 10 man-months) is estimated at
US$15,000 per man-month including travel, living and miscellaneous expenses.
Physical contingencies are estimated at 10% of base cost for the
sub-transmission and distribution sub-projects. Detailed project costs are
shown in Annex 4.2, and are summarized in the following table:

foreign cost of the project and the front-end fee, would be made at standard
Bank terms with a 15 year maturity, including a 3 year grace period. For
financial forecast purposes, an interest rate of 10.97% p.a. was assumed.
The local cost of the project, US$27.4 million or 46% of the project cost,



- 15 -
would be financed by IRHE's internal cash generation. No Government
financing is required for the proposed project, but during negotiations of
the proposed loan the Government should agree to provide any additional funds
that may be necessary to carry out the project.
Implementation
4,11      The design of the project will be carried out by IRHE's engineers
who have acquired enough experience during previous projects executed with
the assistance of consultants. The exception would be the design of the
115 kV, 7 km San Francisco-Monte Oscuro underground feeder, for which four
man-months of specialized consulting services are required. For the energy
losses study (para. 4.13) IRHE will also require specialized consultant's
services estimated at six man-months. IRHE expects to contract these
services from one of its present consultants.
4.12      Construction and insta'llation of the physical components of the
project will be executed in the same manner as for the Fifth Power Project,
as this method has proved to be successful: IRHE will carry out the
installation of all routine distribution expansion and in general all
sub-projects that require service disconnection or energized line work. All
other projects will be contracted. As a result of the implementation
approach agreed for the execution of the Fifth Power Project, IRHE has now a
total of 54 well equipped and experienced construction crews, which could
implement the proposed project without difficulty within the estimated
construction schedule.
4.13      In the past few years IRHE's energy losses have increased, the main
reasons being: (i) increase of the length of transmission lines; (ii) distri-
bution system overloads; and (iii) increase in illegal use of electricity.
In order to find solutions to decrease these losses, a diagnostic study was
prepared in January 1983 under a UNDP funded program for which the Bank was
the executing agency, which also included a review on efficiency improvements
to existing thermal plants,  A second phase for the energy loss study will be
continued by a team of IRHEE's engineers (40 man-months) assisted by a consul-
tant (para. 4.11). The proposed loan would finance the consulting services
for this study as well as the cost of fixed and portable metering equipment
required to determine loading of substation transformers, feeders, distribu-
tion transformers, etc. The gathering of demand information through these
instruments is fundamental for an efficient design and operation of distribu-
tion systems,
Procurement
4.14      All the equipment, materials and civil works not carried out
by IRHE will be procured through international competitive bidding, in
accordance with Bank guidelines,  Following successful purchasing policies
established for the Fifth Power Project, IRHE would do all purchases in a
small number of bulk contracts (Annex 4.3).  IRHE will not request
preferences for local suppliers because the equipment and materials required
for the project are not produced locally.



- 16 -
Disbursement
4.15      Disbursements from the loan account will be fully documented and
would be made for 100% of the foreign expenditures for equipment, materials,
civil works and consulting services. The estimated disbursement schedule
(Annex 4.4) is based on detailed construction programs prepared by IRHE which
envisions final equipment delivery by July 1986 (Annex 4.3) and project
completion by December 1986. This disbursement schedule reflects
peculiarities in the implementation of distribution projects and is
considered reasonable. Bank's standard profiles were not used mainly
because, particularly for Panama, they are based on experience mostly with
hydrolectric and thermal projects. The closing date for the proposed loan
would be June 1987 to allow IRHE enough time to pay funds retained to
suppliers.
Environment
4.17      Following IRHE's usual practice, the proposed project will be
carried out with due regard to environmental protection. None of the sub-
projects or the routine distribution expansion included in the project is
expected to involve any risk to the environment. Rehabilitation and expan-
sion of existing facilities in most cases will not involve new right-of-
ways. In the case of new lines and substations, the corresponding routes and
locations have been selected to minimize new right-of-ways involving
clearance.
Project Risks
4.18      The execution of the project does not involve risks other than
those normally associated with the construction of sub-transmission and
distribution works. IRHE carries out its construction works safely and has a
low record of accidents. All the rehabilitation works of existing
installations in congested urban areas, and the expansion which would require
line disconnections or energized line work, will be executed by IRHE. Some
rehabilitation of existing distribution and sub-transmission works will be
carried out by contractors under IRHE's supervision to ensure due
coordination with local authorities. Construction schedules for the
subprojects are based on average completion times for similar installations
and consequently no major delays are expected in the execution of the
project.

5. FINANCES
Summary
5.01      Since 1977 IRHE has kept a sustained improving trend in its
financial performance and its present financial situation appears to be
adequate. The difficulties which arose in late 1982 as a consequence of the
cost increase of the Fortuna project and the failure of the previously
arranged financing have been recently overcome by preliminary agreements on a
supplementary financing package. IRHE's 1983-87 fund requirement amounts to
MUS$774.7 of which MUS$59.3 or 7.7% of the total correspond to the proposed
VI project (Annex 5.3). The net internal cash generation would finance
MUS$383.5 or 45.5% of the total requirements; capital contributions from the
Government and consumers would fund MUS$17.5 or 2.3% of the total, and the
remaining 48.2% would be covered by loans amounting to MUS$373.7. This
financing plan is reasonable, assuming that the present adequate tariff
levels are maintained as well as the interest shown by external lenders. The
resulting financial situation is expected to continue its improving trend
during the forecast period.
Past Performance and Present Position
5.02      Since 1977 IRHE has kept a sustained improving trend in its
financial performance and, having overcome by early 1983 some uncertainties
on the financing of its construction program (mainly the Fortuna project),
its present financial situation appears to be adequate.  IRHE's financial
performance deteriorated substantially during the period 1974-76, mainly due
to low tariff levels and insufficient Government capital contributions.  In
1977, in connection with the Fourth Power Project (Loan 1470-PAN), IRHE and
the Government agreed with the Bank on a program for financial recovery
calling, inter alia, for: (i) tariff increases allowing IRHE to reach rates
of return of 7% in 1977, 8% in 1978 and 8.75% in 1979 and thereafter, which
were then covenanted; (ii) Government equity contributions totalling US$49.5
million over the 1977-81 period; and (iii) settlement of overdue accounts by
the Government and its agencies. These financial agreements were further
ratified in 1979 in line with the Fifth Power Project (Loan 1778-PAN). IRHE
and the Government have been substantially in compliance with the above
undertakings; IRHE's actual rates of return have consistently increased from
6.9% in 1977 to 9.2% in 1981 due to an adequate tariff policy, which has kept
pace with inflation and fuel prices. However, the return in 1982 fell to
7.4% due to lower sales resulting from the generally stagnant economic
situation of the country, and the unusually dry season which demanded higher
thermal generation than forecast. Nevertheless, it is expected that IRHE
will be able to meet the covenant rates of return in 1983 and thereafter.
Self-financing, debt service coverage and other financing ratios have also
ranged close to   Fifth Power Project estimates.
5.03      The difficulties which arose in late 1982 as a consequence of the
cost increase of the Fortuna project and the failure of the previously
arranged financing have been recently overcome by preliminary agreements on a
supplementary financing package with various agencies including the Bank, the
IDB, and commercial banks as well as bilateral Government aid agreements.
Because of unforeseen geological conditions encountered in the execution of



- 18 -
the underground works of the Fortuna project, resulting in a cost increase of
MUS$241.4 (including interest during construction), IRHE had to devise an
emergency financial plan which included the Venezuelan and Mexican Investment
Fund committed in the San Jose Agreement of April 1980. The unexpected
financial difficulties of these countries in mid-1982 made this course
impossible, and IRHE had to explore other avenues including the Bank, IDB,
Italian Cooperation Agencies and commercial banks. Finally, in March 1983,
preliminary agreements on a supplementary financing package were set as
follows: the Bank, MUS$31.3; IDB, ordinary funds, MUS$60.0 and commercial
banks syndication, MUS$30.0; Venezuelan Investment Fund, MUS$12.3; suppliers'
credit, MUS$0.2; Italian Government Export Credit Insurance Agency, MUS$25.0;
and other commercial banks, MUS$46.7; the remaining balance is to be funded
by the Government, MUS$10.4 and IRHE's internal cash generation. The project
is progressing markedly on the updated schedule and is expected to be
commissioned by mid-1984, about a year and a half behind the original
schedule.
5.04      In order to partially offset the gaps resulting from the lack of
long term financing for domestic components of its investment program and to
avoid further delays in the construction schedule of the Fortuna project, in
1980-82 IRHE resorted to excessive short and medium term financing, which has
been available in Panama, exceeding the limit covenanted under Bank loans.
However, IRHE is making some efforts to reduce such high level of short term
debt (from MUS$58.3 in 1981 to MUS$55.8 in 1982) and has prepared a plan
(para. 5.07 and Annex 5.3, footnote g/) for reducing its short term debt
position to a more manageable level.
Financial Structure
5.05      As of December 31, 1982, IRHE capitalization was (Annex 5.4):
Equity                           MUS$              %
Capital                        113.7
Grants                           7.5
Retained Earnings              205.9
Revaluation Reserve            313.2
640.3            56
Long Term Debt                   363.7            31
Current Liabilities              122.8            11
Other Liabilities                 26.9             2
Total            1,153.7           100
5.06      As of December 31, 1982, IRHE's principal creditor was the Bank;
the debt balance under its first five loans amounted to MUS$96.2 (26.5% of
total long term debt); the second largest creditor is IDB with MUS$96 (26.4%)
followed by Libra Bank, MUS$91.1 (25.1%), the. Government (by transference of
a loan from Dillon Read Overseas) MUS$39.2 (10.8%) and suppliers and
commercial banks (Annex 5.6).

Investment and Financing Plan
5.07      IRHE's 1983-87 investment program, including its own construction
program (para. 4.04 and Annex 4.1), interest during construction, require-
ments for working capital and other applications, amounts to MUS$774.7 of
which MUS$59.3 or 7.7% correspond to the proposed VI project. The ongoing
works are comprised of: (a) the final stage of the construction of the
Fortuna project, partially financed by Loan 1470-PAN, amounts to MUS$170.6 or
22%; and(b) other ongoing works such as V Project, partially financed by Loan
1778-PAN and a Rural Electrification Project, amount to MUS$127.6 or 16.5%.
Other future construction, which includes the raising of the Fortuna dam, the
Changuinola project and the interconnection with Costa Rica, amounts to
MUS$245.7 or 31.7%. The interest during construction of these projects is
estimated at MUS$88.4 or 11.4%. The increase in working capital requirements
amount to MUS$27.3 or 3.5%, and other applications to MUS$55.8 or 7.2% which
represents repayment of short term loans. The investment program and finan-
cing plan are summarized on the next page and shown in detail in Annex 5.3.
5.08      IRHE's net internal cash generation would finance MUS$383.5 or
49.5% of the total requirements of the 1983-87 program; capital contributions
from the Government for the Changuinola project and from consumers for urban
and rural distributions projects would fund MUS$17.5 or 2.3% of the total;
the remaining 48.2% would be covered by loans amounting to MUS$373.7.  Of
this figure MUS$23.3 comes from undisbursed proceeds of existing loans
including MUS$11.1 from Loan 1778-PAN. Fortuna package would finance
MUS$198.8 or 25.7% of the total, including: (a) undisbursed proceeds of
existing loans, MUS$35.2 as follows: (i) Loan 1470-PAN: MUS$9.9; (ii) IDB
ordinary funds loan: MUS$14.0; and (iii) suppliers credit: MUS$11.3; and (b)
the following future loans amounting to MUS$163.3 and for which preliminary
agreements have been set: (i) a proposed supplementary financing Bank loan:
MUS$31.3; (ii) an IDB - ordinary funds - supplementary financing loan of
MUS$60.0; (iii) an IDB - commercial banks syndication - supplementary
financing loan, MUS$30.0; (iv) a loan from the Italian Government Export
Credit Insurance Agency: MUS$25.0; (v) a commercial loan from an Italian
bank, MUS$5.0; and (vi) a Venezuelan Investment Fund loan, MUS$12.3. The VI
Project would require the proposed loan of MUS$32.1. Finally, other future
loans amounting to MUS$119.6 would be required for the rest of the program
1983-87; (a) MUS$63.7 from suppliers; (b) MUS$51.4 from international
financing institutions; and (c) MUS$4.5 from local banking institutions.

5.09      IRHE's proposed financing plan for 1983-87 is reasonable.  Assuming
the present adequate tariff levels are maintained in line with rate of return
covenants agreed with the Bank in Loan 1470-PAN, it would be expected that
IRHE would be able to obtain the financing estimated above (para. 5.08) in
view of its present financial position, its tariff policy, as well as
Government support and the interest shown by commercial lenders in projects
supported by both the Bank and IDB. As an indication of availability of
adequate financing, preliminary agreements have recently been set for a
supplementary financing package for the completion of the Fortuna project
(para. 5.03).  The effectiveness of the proposed loan will be conditional upon
the effectiveness of the Bank's suDDlementarv loan to finance the Fortuna
project (para. 7.03).
Future Finances
5.10      Present financial projections are based on:  (a) updated assump-
tions for inflation; (b) an energy balance assuming full commissioning of the
Fortuna hydroplant in the second semester of 1984; and (c) a tariff policy



- 21 -
aiming at achieving the 8.75% rate of return computed on a rate base
calculated using fully revalued fixed assets in operation and 1/4 of total
annual sales as a proxy of a working capital allocation.
5.11      IRHE's financial situation is expected to continue its improving
trend during the forecast period. The debt service coverage on an annual
basis would not descend under 1.7, which is satisfactory; and the debt/equity
ratios (45/54 in 1982) are forecast to remain at safe levels during the
period (27/73 in 1987) despite the borrowings required for construction of
ongoing and future projects.
5.12      The following package of financial convenants, which were agreed
upon by IRHE under the Fortuna and Fifth Power Project loans, will be
repeated for the proposed loan (Sections refer to Loan Agreement of Loan
1778-PAN): (a) adequacy of accounting practices and annual revaluation of
fixed assets (Section 5.01); (b) auditing by independent auditors acceptable
to the Bank (Section 5.02); (c) liens limitations (Section 5.03); (d) short
term debt limitation (Section 5.04(a)); (e) long term debt limitation
(Section 5.04(b)); (f) price of bulk sales (Section 5.05); (g) accounts
receivable targets (Section 5.06); and (h) rate of return (Section 5.07).
6. ECONOMIC ANALYSIS
Least-Cost Solution
6.01      The sub-transmission and distribution program, of which the project
is a part, was designed by IRHE on the basis of a load forecast for the
period 1982-1993. Since the objective of the program is to provide electric
service to new customers and to improve or replace existing facilities,
alternatives are limited. IRHE has made economic comparisons, where appli-
cable, to select the least-cost solution, i.e., conductor size selection, use
of capacitors, routing of transmission lines, location of new substations,
etc., using a discount rate of 11%. Sub-transmission and distribution
voltage levels have been standardized by IRHE: 115 kV for express feeders to
large substations; 34.5 kV for rural distribution and smaller towns, and 13.2
kV and 4.2 kV for urban distribution. The rehabilitation or replacement of
existing installations was included in the program only for components which
could not continue operating without excessive maintenance cost and losses.
Spare capacity at substations is normally provided to maintain about 25% over
the substation peak demand.
Return on Investment
6.02      The proposed distribution project is an integral part of IRHE's
investment program; its economic feasibility cannot be judged on a
stand-alone basis as the project is not justified by itself, but rather in
the context of generation and distribution of electric energy. Consequently,
an economic evaluation for the proposed project was not done. Instead, the
internal financial return for IRHE's overall investment program for the slice



- 22 -
1983-87 was computed as the discount rate equalizing the present value of the
stream of costs and benefits associated with it (Annex 6.1). The cost stream
comprises the capital costs of the development program and the incremental
operation and maintenance costs related to the incremental sales associated
with the program. Incremental fuel costs with respect to 1983 result in
negative values, which are equivalent to fuel savings due to thermal
generation substitution realized with the operation of the Fortuna project.
Investment costs incurred prior to 1983 for ongoing projects, except for
Fortuna, were considered as sunk costs. As a proxy for benefits, the
revenues derived from incremental sales at the average rate prevailing in
December 1982 (12.0 US/kWh) were used. No economic evaluation was made
utilizing shadow prices or to reflect other benefits to society and the
economy of the country, such as those derived from effects of fuel savings on
Panama's external trade balance, improvement of quality of service to
customers, connection of large housing developments for lower income
families, and connection of new industries.
6.03      The internal financial return is 13.4%, which compares favorably
with the opportunity cost of capital for Panama estimated to be 11%.
A sensitivity analysis was made to estimate the impact of major uncertainties
affecting the economic comparison for the following cases:
(a)  Should the capital investment and operation and maintenance costs
(except fuel) be increased by 20%, the rate of return would be
reduced to 11.6%.
(b)  Should the price of oil be decreased by 20% from the US$33 per
barrel assumed in the study, with the consequent decrease of fuel
savings due to Fortuna, the rate of return would be decreased to
11.8%.
(c)  Should costs be increased by 20% as in case (a) and benefits (both
fuel savings and revenue from incremental sales) be decreased by
10%, the rate of return would be decreased to 10%.
6.04      If sunk costs incurred for the Fortuna project prior to 1983 are
excluded in the analysis (US$242.7 million), the rate of return for the
program would be 27%, which also compares favorably with the opportunity cost
of capital in Panama. A sensitivity analysis for the same conditions
described in paragraph 6.03 resulted in the following rates: for case (a),
rate of return reduced to 20.9%; for case (b), to 23.0%; and for case (c), to
17.8%.
AGREEMENTS REACHED AND RECOMMENDATION
7.01      IRHE agreed on efficiency performance indicators which would be
quarterly reported to the Bank (para. 2.10).



- 23 -
7.02      The following main provisions of Loan Agreement 1778-PAN have been
repeated:
(a) execution of the project (Article III);
(b) management and operation of the Borrower Sections 4.01, 4.02, 4.03
and 4.04 (Clause 4.04 (b) updated for consistency with expansion
program 1982-87 in SAR para. 4.03);
(c) adequacy of accounting practices and annual revaluation of fixed
assets (Section 5.01) (para. 5.12);
(d) auditing by independent auditors acceptable to the Bank (Section
5.02) (paras. 2.08 and 5.12);
(e) liens limitations (Section 5.03) (para. 5.12);
(f) short term debt limitation (Section 5.04 (a)) (para. 5.12);
(g) long term debt limitation (Section 5.04 (b)) (para. 5.12);
(h) price of bulk sales (Section 5.05) (para. 5.12);
(i) accounts receivable targets (Section 5.06) (paras. 2.09 and 5.12);
and
(j) rate of return (Section 5.07) (para. 5.12).
Condition of Effectiveness
7.03      The effectiveness of the Bank's supplementary loan for the Fortuna
project (para. 5.09) is a condition of effectiveness for the proposed loan.
Recommendation
7.04      With the above assurances, the proposed project would be suitable
for a Bank loan of MUS$32.1 equivalent, to be made to IRBE with the guarantee
of the Government of Panama. The loan would have a repayment period of 17
years, including 3 years of grace.

the 1983-1985 period and 6Z thereafter.
g/ Cost of hydrometeorological observation activities borne by IRHE.
h/ Based on straight-line method; weighted average depreciation rates have been forecast at 3.1%
for 1983-1984 and 2.3% for 1985 and thereafter.
i/ Includes the Government oil subsidy, 9.75% on IRHE's fuel bills.
J/ See forecast interest charges in Annex 5.6.
