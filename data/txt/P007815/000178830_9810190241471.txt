INTERNATIONAL BANK FOR RECONSTRUCTION AND DEVELOPMENT
REPORT AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT OF THE IBRD
TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS ON
A PROPOSED LOAN IN AN AMOUNT EQUIVALENT TO US$32.1 MILLION
TO INSTITUTO DE RECURSOS HIDRAULICOS Y ELECTRIFICACION
WITH THE GUARANTEE OF THE REPUBLIC OF PANAMA
FOR A SIXTH POWER PROJECT
1.        I submit the following report and recommendation on a proposed
loan to Instituto de Recursos Hidraulicos y Electrificacion (IRHE) with the
guarantee of the Republic of Panama for the equivalent of US$32.1 million,
including the capitalized front end fee, to help finance a Sixth Power
Project. The loan would have a term of 15 years, including 3 years of
grace, with interest at the standard variable rate.
PART I - THE ECONOMY
2.        A report entitled "Panama:  Special Economic Report-Metropolitan
Unemployment" (3833-PAN) was distributed to the Executive Directors on June
7, 1982. The findings of that report and subsequent economic missions to
Panama are summarized below. Country data sheets are attached as Annex I.
3.        Between 1978 and 1982 the Panamanian economy grew at an annual
average rate of 4.4 percent, almost double the rate of population increase.
This reversed a decline in per capita GDP experienced during the mid-1970s.
The principal sources of growth were the provision of international
services, construction and the public sector. Agriculture has been the
least buoyant sector, with no real output growth since 1978.
4.        The Government's three main concerns since 1968 have been to
eliminate rural poverty, to increase national control over the economy,
including the Panama Canal, and to create new sources of economic growth
and exports. Social programs in health and education were extended to most
areas, and an agrarian reform program was initiated. The second goal was
achieved by the U.S.-Panamanian Treaty by which the administration of the
prior Canal Zone reverted to Panama. Major investments were undertaken in
14       transport, tourism, international commercial infrastructure, water supply
and sewerage, and power, mostly to provide support for expected private
activities. Power and most telecommunications facilities were
It       nationalized.  New state enterprises were created for export crops such as
sugar, citrus, and bananas; and a state-owned cement plant was built.
Self-sufficiency in basic foodstuffs such as rice, corn, and beans was also
accorded high priority.
5.        The Government's social programs have had considerable success in
enhancing the quality of life in Panama, as reflected in demographic,
health and educational indicators. Infant mortality was halved between



- 2 -
1970 and 1980, while the birth rate fell more than 20 percent. Access to
potable water for the rural population increased from 41 percent in 1970 to
70 percent in 1980. The proportion of the population enrolled in schools
of all types increased from less than one-quarter to over one-third between
1968 and 1980. In 1981, 57 percent of the population had access to
electricity compared to 52 percent in 1970. The Government's goal is to
increase this to 62 percent by 1986. Despite these achievements, estimates
indicate that some 20 percent of the urban and 30 percent of the rural
population continue to live in poverty.
6.        As regards the Government's economic programs, the Colon Free
Zone and past hydroelectric projects increased employment and earnings from
export of services, and reduced the burden of rising petroleum costs. The
most successful of Government programs was a major change in the banking
legislation in 1970.  This has attracted about 130 banks to Panama; it is
now a major regional Eurodollar Center. Other programs involving direct
production by the public sector or affecting private sector decisions have
been less successful. Agricultural programs have led to self-sufficiency
in rice and increased the output of milk, but have had less impact on the
output of beef and feed grains. State sugar mills have increased output
but they operate unprofitably. Similarly, State enterprises in tourism and
cement have been a burden on the fisc. The public enterprises' direct
competition with private enterprises and uncertainties relating to
Government labor and price policies adversely affected the climate for
private investment. Recent improvements in the dialogue between the
Government and the private sector and a more flexible approach to labor and
price policy have increased private sector confidence.
7.        The high level of outlays for economic and social infrastructure,
coupled with the substantial losses of state enterprises, resulted in
significant increases in the public sector deficit, despite periodic
efforts to strengthen the public finances. This deficit increased from
4.4 percent of GDP in 1970 to over 15 percent of GDP in 1978, before
falling to 11 percent in 1979 and to 6 percent in both 1980 and 1981 in
compliance with a series of Standby Agreements with the IMF. In 1982 the
public sector deficit widened to 11 percent of GDP, well in excess of the
Standby program. Because Panama has no central bank or control over its
currency, the authorities cannot finance their deficit by resorting to
central bank credit. Deficits are, therefore, met by borrowings
denominated in US dollars. Outstanding external public debt increased by
almost one-fifth during 1982, to reach US$3.1 billion, or 73 percent of
GDP. Interest payments on this debt absorbed over one quarter of total
public sector revenues.
8.        This situation prompted the authorities to take a series of
corrective actions in late 1982 and early 1983. The Government is reducing
the public sector deficit to 6 percent of GDP in 1983 and to no more than
5i percent in 1984. This is to be achieved partly by new tax measures, but
mainly by reduced current and capital expenditures. Budgetary controls
have been considerably strengthened, and the public investment program for
1983-84 thoroughly reviewed. Public capital outlays in both years will be
substantially lower than in 1981-82 and a number of projects have been
cancelled or postponed. The IMF Board will be considering in late May 1983
a proposal by its staff to support this program with a two-year standby
arrangement.



-3-
9.        In addition to addressing its short-term financial difficulties
the Government has embarked upon a program of medium-term structural
adjustment. A number of important measures have already been taken which
aim to create an environment where private initiative generates the
buoyancy in economic activity no longer provided by the financially
weakened public sector. They include rationalization of public sector
institutions, reduction of effective protection, reforms in the structure
of incentives and changes in pricing policies. Due to past high levels of
public investment much of the infrastructure required for private sector
activity is already in place. There is social tranquility and excellent
financial, communications and transport facilities, while Panama's
workforce is among the best educated in the area. The Government
anticipates that its new strategy will stimulate private investment leading
to the accelerated production of goods for export, since the scope for
further import substitution and for more growth in the service sector is
limited. The Government's medium-term program is therefore geared towards
greater efficiency in both agriculture and industry to improve their
competitiveness.
10.       The prospects for growth also depend on the use of land and
facilities reverted to Panama and on the higher earnings received under the
Canal Treaty. Implementation of the Treaty began on October 1, 1979, and
will be completed on December 31, 1999, when the Canal and all ancillary
facilities will revert to Panama. Already the ports of Balboa, Cristobal
and Coco Solo Norte, two abandoned airfields, much valuable land, and most
service outlets of the former Panama Canal Company's supply division have
reverted to Panama. The reverting land enhances a spatial orientation in
development strategy which emphasizes the metropolitan area, along the
Canal from the Atlantic to the Pacific, as the best site for activities to
take advantage of Panama's excellent geographic location. The Government
is actively planning the further development of infrastructure in this area
for expanded private sector activities to generate employment, revenues and
rents adequate to pay for these investments.
11.       The longer-term outlook for the Panamanian economy is favorable,
given its geographic advantages, educated workforce, low population/land
ratio, and adequate physical infrastructure. The medium-term outlook will
depend on key domestic policies and on the international economy. The
critical domestic issues include rising urban unemployment, the size of the
public external debt, the relative roles of the public and private sectors,
and the climate for private investment. The scope and depth of the
structural adjustment measures already taken indicate the Government's keen
awareness of these issues. It has a continuing dialogue with the private
sector and is aggressively pursuing a program to attract internationally
integrated assembly industries. Procedures for establishing plants and
granting incentives have been simplified, and labor is trained in
accordance with the specific requirements of incoming firms. Nevertheless,
the very open Panamanian economy will find its medium-terms recovery
thwarted if the recovery in world economic activity is delayed.



- 4 -
12.       The Government has recently acted decisively to reduce the public
sector deficit. In addition, its medium-term structural adjustment program
is designed to rationalize current and capital expenditures and hence
ensure a continuing stable financial environment. Panama has recently
concluded negotiations with the IMF for a two-year Standby arrangement and
is currently discussing possible Bank support for its structural adjustment
program. The Bank has reviewed the investment budget for 1983 which
reflects not only a recognition of the need for austerity but high
standards in selecting priority projects. Panama has a long record of
prompt payment of its debts and a proven capacity to reduce rapidly the
public sector deficit when necessary. On this basis, and given the
Government's clear commitment to a stabilization program supported by the
IMF, Panama is considered creditworthy for Bank lending.
PART II - BANK GROUP OPERATIONS
13.       The Bank has to date made twenty-six loans to Panama totalling
US$435.8 million (net of cancellations). Of these, 13 loans for US$159.0
million are fully disbursed, two for roads totalling US$13.1 million; one
for an airport project for US$20 million; three for agriculture totalling
US$5.7 million; two for fisheries totalling US$8.2 million, three for power
for US$76 million; one for ports for US$24 million; and one for water
supply and sewerage for US$12.0 million. Ongoing operations include one
project for livestock credit; one for development of tropical tree crops;
two for development banking; two for highway maintenance and
rehabilitation; two in the power sector (for generation, transmission and
distribution); one to support energy planning and petroleum exploration;
one to help develop the water supply and sewerage sector; one for the urban
development of Colon; and one for port development. The most recent loan
to Panama, for supplementary financing for the Fortuna Hydroelectric
Project, was approved by the Executive Directors on March 29, 1983.
14.       IFC has made three investments in Panama.  The first was a
commitment in 1971 to acquire US$0.3 million of equity in the Corporacion
de Desarrollo Hotelero, S.A. and to lend to the Corporacion US$1.2 million
to build a new international hotel. The second was a commitment in
December 1977 to lend US$2.4 million and acquire US$1.4 million in equity
in Vidrios Panamenos, S.A., the first glass container factory in Panama.
These projects have been satisfactorily completed. The third is a
commitment in 1979 to acquire US$2.5 million in equity in the Banco
Latinoamericano de Exportaciones (BLADEX), a regional export bank promoted
by the Government of Panama.
15.       While there are some difficulties, satisfactory overall progress
in the implementation of ongoing projects is reflected in the steady
increase in Bank disbursements, from US$17 million in FY79 and US$16.1
million in FY80, to US$31 million in FY81 and US$39 million in FY82. Annex
II contains a summary statement of Bank loans and IFC investments as of
March 31, 1983, and notes on the execution of ongoing projects.



- 5 -
16.       Bank lending to Panama is designed to support the Government's
development strategy particularly as regards the further development of
Panama's infrastructure and service industries, the diversification of
production and exports, and the rationalization of economic policies in
order to create the climate conducive to stimulating economic activity.
Specifically, the Bank assists those sectors in which it can make a special
contribution in terms of: (i) developing policies and institutions; (ii)
removing remaining infrastructure bottlenecks; and (iii) better utilizing
the country's natural resources, including its geographic location. In
addition to the proposed project, projects under active consideration for
Bank lending include a third livestock credit project and a structural
adjustment operation.
17.       Both USAID and the Inter-American Development Bank (IDB) have
invested substantial amounts in agriculture and social services (including
family planning in the case of USAID). Past lending patterns are likely to
persist, at least as regards the social services, because the Government
prefers to borrow on concessionary terms for these sectors, while utilizing
other assistance for projects which are expected to result in more imme-
diate economic benefits. In addition to agriculture and social services,
the IDB is financing road construction, industry and telecommunications,
sectors in which it is likely to continue lending. The IDB also partici-
pated with the Bank in the financing of the Fortuna Hydroelectric Project
and is financing a rural electrification program. USAID expects to conti-
nue its efforts in manpower training and projects oriented toward environ-
mental protection. USAID is also lending for alternative sources of energy
(other than petroleum).
18.       The Bank's share of Panama's publicly-guaranteed external debt
outstanding and disbursed was 6.2 percent at the end of 1982 and the Bank's
share of public external debt service was less than 4 percent in 1982.
These percentages are expected to increase slightly in the 1980's.
PART III - THE SECTOR
19.       Internationally oriented services (the Panama Canal, Colon Free
Zone industrial and commercial operations, transit services, and banking)
play an important role in the Panamanian economy and represent more than 60
percent of Panama's GDP, which is reflected in the heavy urbanization of
the population. Therefore the Government has consistently given high
priority to the development of the supporting infrastructure, including the
provision of electric power. In addition, the supply of electricity and
other essential services to provincial towns and rural areas helps the
economic development in the provinces, improves social conditions and
reduces migration to the metropolitan areas of Panama City and Colon.
Energy Resources and Service
20.       Panama depends on imported petroleum for about 90 percent of its
total commercial energy supply. Coupled with a national campaign for



-6-
conservation, the Government adopted in the late 1970s a policy for substi-
tuting hydro for thermal energy generation. This has helped reduce the
share of thermal generation from 94 percent in 1975 to 41 percent in 1982,
while total sales increased from 1,026 GWh to 1,672 GWh. Approximately 30
percent of electricity consumption is residential and 31 percent is
commercial, reflecting the importance of the services sector in the
economy. Industry accounts for about 12 percent and the Government for
about 19 percent. Other consumers represent 8 percent. Between 1970 and
1980 electricity consumption increased at an average annual rate of 8.8
percent. The average rate of increase dropped to 7.2 percent from 1975 to
1982 due to conservation measures, generation restrictions and, more
recently, the sluggishness in the economy. At about 880 kWh per
capita, electricity consumption in 1982 in Panama is among the highest in
Latin America. In 1981, 80 percent of the urban population and 39 percent
of the rural population, or 57 percent of the total, had access to
electricity. The goal of IRHE is to extend the service to reach 85 percent
of the urban population, 43 percent of the rural population and 62 percent
of the total population by 1986.
21.       The potential for increasing renewable energy supply lies mainly
in hydropower development. IRHE has identified about 30 sites with a
potential of about 1900 MW, and has carried out pre-feasibility studies for
11 of these sites, with a potential of about 1500 MW, with assistance from
the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP). When developed, these 11
sites would meet the country's requirements over the next 25 years. UNDP,
the IDB, and Sweden are financing feasibility studies for three of these
projects with a combined capacity of 640 MW. In addition, preliminary
studies are being prepared for the installation of 25 mini-hydro plants
with a total capacity of about 1,000 kW.
Energy Planning
22.       Panama's National Energy Commission (CONADE), created in 1980 as
an advising body to the President of the Republic, is in charge of studying
and planning all matters related to energy supply and consumption in
Panama. It is headed by IRHE's Director General and operates with person-
nel of IRHE's Planning Directorate. The Energy Planning and Petroleum
Exploration Promotion Project, assisted by Loan No. 1954-PAN, of April 23,
1981, includes studies and surveys for geothermal and petroleum resources
and coal deposits. Progress in implementation of this project has been
slow. However, preliminary investigations indicate a potential of about
400 MW from geothermal resources and further surveys are being carried
out. Preliminary surveys show no indication of any sizeable petroleum
resources, but there appears to be a reasonable potential for coal depo-
sits. IRHE is also conducting experiments to utilize other renewable
energy sources, but these are not expected to contribute significantly to
Panama's energy supply in the near future.
Power Sector Organization
23.       IRHE, an autonomous Government agency created in 1961, is
responsible for public sector power supply in Panama. IRHE's Board of
Directors, chaired by the Minister of Planning and Economic Policy, is



- 7 -
responsible for power sector policies. There is no separate regulatory
body for the sector, and tariffs have to be approved by the Cabinet upon
the recommendation of IRHE's Board, through the Finance Commission (chaired
by the Vice President of the Republic). IRHE is developing into a strong
agency with competent management. IRHE's organization, administration and
systems have benefited from substantial technical assistance provided under
previous Bank loans (Paras. 28-32 below).
Power Sector Development and Strategy
24.       At the end of 1982, IRHE's installed capacity reached 516 MW, of
which about 50 percent was hydroelectric capacity. The Panama Canal
Commission and other agencies have an additional 231 MW, 80 percent of
which is thermal.
25.       The main objectives of IRHE's expansion program are:  (a) to
extend service coverage levels at the least cost; (b) to integrate the
small isolated systems into the regional systems; (c) to interconnect the
regional systems through a high-voltage national grid; and (d) to develop
the country's hydro resources to satisfy the increase in demand and to
substitute high cost thermal generation. In addition IRHE continues to
upgrade the service. The present expansion program is based on a Master
Plan for 1979-2003, prepared by IRHE in 1978-1979, with the assistance of
consultants. The Plan consists of the completion of the 300 MW Fortuna
Hydroelectric Project (assisted by Loan No. 1470-PAN of of July 1, 1977),
a second stage of the Fortuna Project (raising the dam to increase firm
power generation), installation of a 36 MW gas turbine (completed in 1982),
the installation of the third 75 MW generating unit at the Bayano
hydroelectric plant in 1990, and the construction of the 300 MW Changuinola
Hydroelectric project in 1992. The development program also includes the
necessary transmission and distribution systems to extend the service, and
the interconnection of the national grid with the Costa Rican grid. By
1985, when the Fortuna Hydroelectric Project is expected to be in full
operation, almost all electricity requirements in Panama will be met by
hydroelectric power.
26.       With the assistance of consultants financed by IDB, IRHE has
prepared a five-year rural electrification program. The first stage
(1983-1985) is being executed with assistance from IDB.  It includes the
installation of 1,400 km of transmission lines to serve 12,500 new
customers.
Sector Constraints
27.       The main constraints to the development of the sector are the
high cost of the hydro expansion program, the burden of the growing sector
on IRHE's capabilities, and the relatively high electricity losses of gross
energy generation (14.5 percent in 1982). Bank and IDB participation in
the financing of IRHE's development programs has been an important catalyst
for enabling IRHE to obtain financing from official sources and commercial
banks for its investment needs. Most of the balance of the cost of IRHE's
development programs is covered from its own internal cash generation. The
Government provides minor amounts to cover part of these costs as equity



- 8 -
contributions. IRilE's capabilities to develop and manage the system are
being enhanced through improvements in organization, management and
systems. In the meantime, technical assistance through the hiring of
consultants provides the inputs to fill the gap. System losses are also
being given increasing attention by IRHE's management. A UNDP-financed,
Bank-executed, Power System Loss Reduction Study is under way. Its draft
identification report is being discussed with IRHE, and agreed
recommendations and solutions would be implemented under the proposed
project.
Bank Participation in the Power Sector
28.       Since 1962, the Bank has made five loans and a supplemental loan
to IRHE, totalling US$172.3 million. These have helped to finance mostly
hydroelectric and thermal plants and their associated transmission, but
have also included financing for some sub-transmission and distribution
components. Bank participation has contributed to improve sector organiza-
tion and planning and has facilitated the inflow of foreign commercial
financing to the sector on appropriate terms. Bank lending has assisted
IRHE and the Government in their efforts to establish electricity rates
which are consistent with long-run generation costs and permit the sector
to generate a substantial part of the funds required for its investment
program. The First Power Project (Loan 322-PAN of 1963; US$4 million)
helped finance a small hydroelectric plant in Central Panama and was
completed without major difficulties. The Second Power Project (Loan
661-PAN of 1970 for US$42 million) helped finance the first stage of the
Bayano hydroelectric plant; some diesel and steam generating units;
associated transmission; expansion of IRHE's distribution system; and
studies, training and consultants' services. The project was completed in
1976 with a delay of about 22 months and cost overruns amounting to about
84 percent of appraisal estimates. These were due to the need to change
the consulting engineers, problems with the main contractor, temporary
shortages of materials and higher than expected inflation rates in
1972-75. The Project Performance Audit Report (Report No. 2508-OED, dated
May 15, 1979) was distributed to the Executive Directors.
29.       Loan 948-PAN for US$30 million made in 1974, financed the Third
Power Project consisting of diesel generation, high-voltage transmission, a
national load dispatch and communication center, sub-transmission and                   9
distribution and studies and training. The Third Power Project was
substantially completed by the end of 1977, the original completion date.
Nevertheless, some of the sub-transmission works included in the project
suffered substantial delays and were completed only in mid-1980. The
delays were due mainly to IRHE's then lack of experience with
sub-transmission and distribution projects, to difficulties with
contractors and to the concentration of IRHE's efforts on the large
generation and transmission projects under execution.   The project was
successfully completed and cost, in current prices, was 27 percent over the
appraisal estimate. The Project Completion Report was issued in June 1982.



30.       Loan 1470-PAN, for US$42 million, made in 1977 helped in the
financing of the Fourth Power Project which comprises the 300-MW Fortuna
hydroelectric plant, associated transmission, an organizational improvement
program and training. The project was originally cofinanced by IDB and
suppliers. Due to unforeseen geological conditions, the project has
suffered substantial cost overruns. A supplemental loan for US$31.3
million towards financing the cost overrun of the components originally
financed by the Bank was approved by the Executive Directors on March 29,
1983. IDB, bilateral sources and commercial banks are also contributing
towards the financing. Construction of the dam was completed in February
1983 and other project works are progressing satisfactorily. The project
is expected to be completed in October 1984, with 16 months' delay. The
project remains the least cost solution for providing the needed energy,
with a rate of return of about 17 percent.
31.       Loan 1778-PAN for US$23 million made in 1980 assists in the
rehabilitation and expansion of IRHE's distribution systems across the
country. After initial delays, progress is satisfactory and the project is
expected to be completed in March 1984, three months behind schedule. A
cost overrun of about 30 percent is being financed from IRHE's own
resources.
32.       Bank continued assistance to IRHE is directed towards resolving
the sector constraints by providing financial and technical assistance for
the rational development of the sector and of IRHE as an institution with
the major responsibility in it.
PART IV - THE PROJECT
33.       The proposed project is a second stage of IRHE's sub-transmission
and distribution program initiated under the Fifth Power Project (Loan No.
1778-PAN). The project was prepared by IRHE and was appraised in October-
November 1982. Negotiations were held in Washington in April 1983. IRHE's
delegation was led by Mr. Victor Carlos Urrutia, Deputy Director General of
IRHE, and the Government was represented by Mrs. Nuvia de Jarpa, Head of
the Department of Investment Planning in the Ministry of Planning and
Economic Policy. The appraisal mission's report, entitled "Staff Appraisal
Report - Panama Sixth Power Project" (No. 4376a-PAN, dated May 16, 1983),
is being distributed separately.  Annex III contains a supplementary
project data sheet.
Project Objectives and Description
34.       The proposed project aims at rehabilitating and extending IRHE's
sub-transmission and distribution system to meet growing demand from
residential, commercial, and industrial users, including the trans-isthmian
oil pipeline which operates now on captive thermal plants. The project
would also continue the strengthening of IRHE and would help in reducing
system losses. Specifically the project covers IRHE's sub-transmission and
distribution program for 1984 to 1986. It represents the least cost
alternative for the economic distribution of generated energy to meet
projected demand and supports growth needs of the industrial and commercial
sectors. The project also includes a program for reducing system losses.



- 10 -
35.       The project consists of the following components:
(a) sub-transmission: installation of (i) 65 km of 115 kV aerial
lines, 7 km of 115 kV underground feeders and 19 km of 34.5 kV
lines; and (ii) 121 MVA of substation capacity at 115 kV and 34.5
kV;
(b) distribution (13.2 kV and lower voltages): installation of:
(i) about 1,700 km of primary and secondary circuits; (ii) 40 km
of 13.2 kV underground circuits; (iii) 3,200 distribution
transformers, with a total capacity of 150,000 kVA; (iv) 9,000
street lamps; and (v) 32,000 meters;
(c) metering equipment: installation in 35 substations of metering
equipment to be used for detailed load forecasting and energy
losses study; and
(d) consulting services: design of a 115 kV underground feeder lines
and preparation of an energy losses study.
Implementation
36.       IRHE would be the borrower and would carry out most of the design
and installation works of the project. In carrying out the Fifth Power
Project (Loan No 1778-PAN of January 30, 1980), IRHE has gained enough
experience and demonstrated capabilities to carry out these tasks.
Consultants would assist with the more complex design of the 115 kV, 7 km
San Francisco-Monte Oscuro underground feeder, for which four man-months of
consultant services would be required. In 1982, IRHE had 5,415 permanent
and temporary employees, which gives lower productivity indicators than the
average for similar utilities. IRHE's management is aware of the problem,
has frozen personnel hiring and is taking measures for improving the ratio
between the number of employees and customers. In order to increase staff
productivity and avoid overstaffing, IRHE would agree to meet a
satisfactory set of performance indicators (Section 4.01(b) and Schedule 5
of the draft Loan Agreement). This is expected to be met through system
expansion and by not replacing staff leaving the service.
Technical Assistance
37.       Under the proposed project IRHE would receive six man-months of
technical assistance in carrying out the energy losses study and designing
a program for its implementation. These consultants, as well as those
referred to in para 36 would have qualifications and be retained on terms
and conditions satisfactory to the Bank. (Section 3.02 of the draft Loan
Agreement).
IRHE's Financial Situation
38.       Since 1977 IRHE has kept a sustained improving trend in its
financial performance and is expected to continue having a satisfactory
financial situation. In 1977, in connection with the Fourth Power Project
(Loan 1470-PAN), IRHE and the Government agreed to a program for financial
recovery calling, inter alia, for: (i) tariff increases allowing IRHE to



- 11 -
reach rates of return of 7 percent in 1977, 8 percent in 1978 and 8.75
percent in 1979 and thereafter; (ii) Government equity contributions
totalling US$49.5 million over the 1977-81 period; and (iii) settlement of
overdue accounts by the Government and its agencies. These financial
agreements were maintained in connection with the Fifth Power Project (Loan
1778-PAN). IRHE and the Government have been substantially in compliance
with the above undertakings. Due to an adequate tariff policy, which has
kept pace with inflation and fuel prices, IRHE's actual rates of return
have increased from 6.9 percent in 1977 to 9.2 percent in 1981.  In § ^
1982, IRHE raised its basic tariff again by 6 percent. However, due to
lower sales resulting from the generally stagnant economic situation and an
unusually dry season which demanded higher than forecast thermal
generation, the rate of return fell to 7.4 percent in 1982. Nevertheless,
it is expected that IRHE will be able to meet the required rates of return
in 1983 and thereafter. Self-financing, debt service coverage and other
financial ratios have also ranged close to estimates. It is forecast that
IRHE's debt service coverage will rise from the present 1.3 ratio to 1.7 in
1987, and that its debt equity ratio will fall from the current 44/56 to
27/73 in the same year.  IRHE would continue to adjust its tariffs from
time to time in order that it would achieve, once again, a rate of return
of 8.75 percent, on its average revalued net fixed assets in operation plus
working capital amounting to three months' revenues (Section 5.07(a) of the
draft Loan Agreement). This is the rate of return specified in Panama's
electricity legislation. The adequacy of the rate of return would be
reviewed by IRHE and the Bank as necessary (Section 5.07(b) of the draft
Loan Agreement). IRHE's fixed assets would be revalued annually (Section
5.01(b) of the draft Loan Agreement). In order to avoid recurrence of some
disadvantageous bulk sale contracts in the mid-1970's, IRHE would not sell
electricity to bulk consumers at prices lower than its long-run marginal
costs (Section 5.05 of draft Loan Agreement).
39.       In order to fill the gaps resulting from the recent lack of
long-term financing for its construction program in 1980-82, IRHE resorted
to excessive short- and medium-term borrowing, which threatened IRHE's
financial position. To avoid a recurrence, IRHE would not incur any short
term debt if this would cause its total short term debt to exceed 20
percent of its cash operating, maintenance and administrative expenses
during the preceding 12 months (Section 5.04(a) of the draft Loan
Agreement).  IRHE would also not incur, without Bank approval, any long
term debt if its net revenues do not cover its maximum future debt service
requirements more than 1.4 times (Section 5.04(b) of the draft Loan
Agreement).
40.       At the end of December 1982, overdue payments reached about 67
days of IRHE's billings. However, the Government and public entities,
which account for a major part of the arrears, usually pay in lump sums.
The Government is considering measures to expedite regular payments, while
IRHE is strengthening its collection efforts.  Under the proposed loan,
IRHE would take all necessary measures to maintain no more than 60 days of
electricity billings outstanding and unpaid (Section 5.06 of the draft Loan
Agreement). The Government would settle its currently outstanding amounts
by March 30, 1984, and would prepare by October 31, 1983, a program,
satisfactory to the Bank, for settlement of existing debt of municipalities
and autonomous agencies, including dates of payment. Future debts would
not exceed 60 days of electricity billings (Section 3.02 of the draft
Guarantee Agreement).



- 12 -
41.       The difficulties which arose in late 1982 as a consequence of the
cost increase of the Fortuna Project have been recently overcome by
agreements on a supplementary financing package with various agencies
including the Bank (US$31.3 million), the IDB (US$90.0 million), Italian
aid agencies (US$25.0 million), the Venezuelan Investment Fund (US$12.3
million), and commercial banks (US$46.7 million) (para. 30 above). In
order to ensure IRHE's ability to maintain its finances on a sound basis,
the effectiveness of the Bank's above-mentioned supplementary loan of
US$31.3 million, approved on March 29, 1983, would be a condition of
effectiveness of the proposed loan (Section 7.01 of the draft Loan
Agreement).
42.       Financial projections indicate that IRHE would be able to meet
its financial obligations and generate internally approximately 50 percent
of the financing needs for its construction program for 1983-87, without
significant increase in its tariffs. In view of savings in fuel costs due
to conversion to hydropower, projected tariff increases would be lower than
projected inflation rates in the coming few years. IRHE would not
undertake, without Bank agreement, any expansion project not included in
this construction program which would exceed one percent of IRHE's revalued
gross fixed assets in operation (Section 4.05 of the draft Loan Agreement).
Project Cost and Financing
43.       The total cost of the project, excluding interest during
construction, is estimated at US$59.4 million, of which US$32.0 million (54
percent) would be in foreign exchange. IRHE is exempt from duties and
taxes. Cost estimates are based on January 1983 prices, and IRHE's recent
experience. Physical contingencies are 10 percent. Price contingencies
are estimated for local cost at 7.5 percent in 1983, 1984 and 1985, and 6
percent in 1986, and for foreign cost at 8 percent for 1983, 7.5 percent
for 1984, 7 percent for 1985, and 6 percent for 1986. This is consistent
with Bank guidelines. Foreign consulting services (10 man-months) are
estimated at US$15,000 per man-month, including travel and other expenses.
44.       The proposed loan would finance the foreign exchange cost of the
project plus the front end fee. IRHE would finance the total local cost
and interest during construction.
Procurement and Disbursement
45.       All equipment, materials and civil works not carried out by
IRHE's own staff would be procured through international competitive
bidding, according to Bank guidelines.  Installation would be carried out
by contractors or by IRHE's own staff. Disbursements would be made against
100 percent of foreign expenditures for civil works, equipment, materials,
installation and consulting services.
Benefits and Risks
46.       The sub-transmission and distribution program, of which the
project is a part, was designed by IRHE on the basis of a load forecast for
the period 1982-1993. Since the objective of the program is to provide
electric service to new customers and to improve or replace existing
facilities, alternatives are limited. IRHE has made economic comparisons,



- 13 -
where applicable, to select the least-cost solution, i.e., conductor size
selection, use of capacitors, routing of transmission lines, location of
new substations, etc., using a discount rate of 11 percent.
Sub-transmission and distribution voltage levels have been standardized by
IRHE: 115 kV for express feeders to large substations; 34.5 kV for rural
distribution and smaller towns, and 13.2 kV and 4.2 kV for urban
distribution. The rehabilitation or replacement of existing installations
was included in the program only for components which could not continue
operating without excessive maintenance cost and losses. Spare capacity at
substations is normally provided to maintain about 25 percent over the
substation peak demand.
47.       The proposed distribution project is an integral part of IRHE's
investment program; its economic feasibility cannot be judged on a
stand-alone basis as the project is not justified by itself, but rather in
the context of generation and distribution of electric energy.
Consequently, an economic evaluation for the proposed project was not
done. Instead, the internal financial return for IRHE's overall investment
program for the slice 1983-87 was computed as the discount rate equalizing
the present value of the stream of costs and benefits associated with it.
The cost stream comprises the capital costs of the development program and
the incremental operation and maintenance costs related to the incremental
sales associated with the program. Incremental fuel costs with respect to
1983 result in negative values, which are equivalent to fuel savings due to
thermal generation substitution realized with the operation of the Fortuna
project. Investment costs incurred prior to 1983 for ongoing projects,
except for Fortuna, were considered as sunk costs. As a proxy for
benefits, the revenues derived from incremental sales at the average tariff
prevailing in December 1982 were used (12.0 USc/kWh). This is higher than
the long-run marginal cost. No economic evaluation was made utilizing
shadow prices or to reflect other benefits to society and the economy of
the country, such as those derived from effects of fuel savings on Panama's
external trade balance, improvement of quality of service to customers,
connection of large housing developments for lower income families, and
connection of new industries.
48.       The internal financial return of IRHE's 1983-87 investment
program is approximately 13.4 percent, which compares favorably with the
opportunity cost of capital for Panama estimated to be 11 percent.  A
sensitivity analysis was made to estimate the impact of major uncertainties
affecting the comparison for the following cases:
t               (a)  Should the capital investment and operation and maintenance costs
(except fuel) be increased by 20 percent, the rate of return
would be reduced to 11.6 percent.
(b)  Should the future price of oil be decreased by 20 percent from
the US$33 per barrel assumed in the study, with the consequent
decrease of fuel savings due to Fortuna, the rate of return would
be decreased to 11.8 percent.
(c) Should costs be increased by 20 percent as in case (a) and
benefits (both fuel savings and revenue from incremental sales)
be decreased by 10 percent, the rate of return would be 10
percent. However, the likelihood of more adverse conditions is
remote.



- 14 -
49.       If sunk costs incurred for the Fortuna project prior to 1983 are
excluded in the analysis (US$242.7 million), the rate of return for the
program would be 27 percent. A sensitivity analysis for the same
conditions described above resulted in the following rates: for case (a),
rate of return reduced to 20.9 percent; for case (b), to 23 percent; and
for case (c) to 17.8 percent.
50.       The proposed project involves no unusual risk beyond that
normally associated with power distribution projects, and would have no
adverse impact on the environment. In view of IRHE's enhanced capacity as
demonstrated in the implementation of the Fifth Power Project (para. 36
above), and in view of the advanced stage of project preparation, no delays
are anticipated under the proposed project.
PART V - LEGAL INSTRUMENTS AND AUTHORITY
51.       The draft Loan Agreement between IRHE and the Bank, the draft
Guarantee Agreement between the Republic of Panama and the Bank, and the
Report of the Committee provided for in Article III, Section 4(iii) of the
Articles of Agreement are being distributed separately. The effectiveness
of the Amending Agreement to grant the supplementary loan to IRHE for
financing the cost overrun on the Fortuna Hydroelectric Project (Loan
1470-PAN) would be a condition of effectiveness of the proposed Loan
Agreement (para. 41). Special conditions of the loan are listed in Section
III of Annex III.
52.       I am satisfied that the proposed loan would comply with the
Articles of Agreement of the Bank.
PART VI - RECOMMENDATION
53.       I recommend that the Executive Directors approve the proposed
loan.

C.   STATUS OF PROJECTS IN EXECUTION (as of March 31, 1983) 1/
Loan 1397:      Second Livestock Development Project: US$8 Million Loan of
April 28, 1977; Date of Effectiveness: February 1, 1978;
Closing Date: August 28, 1984.
After a slow start progress is picking up. Changes in the milk legisla-
tion required in connection with the project involve a modification in the
method of determining milk grade and thus the price paid to producers: the
grade of milk is now determined by the standard of on-farm processing
facilities.   The modified legislation will require that producers be paid
according to the quality of milk produced. The legislation was approved in 1978
but is not being implemented. Government has indicated that implementation will
commence once the Ministry of Health is equipped with control equipment. In
1981, the Bank agreed to modify the livestock breeding farm component which was
to be carried out in an autonomous state farm that has become part of a military
base; it is now being carried out in five different research extension farms
of the Ministry of Agriculture. Action is also being taken to hire consultants
to implement staff training and assist with implementation of the new milk
pricing legislation. Loan commitments are behind appraisal estimates due to
delays in commitments in 1977, the year of the Canal Treaty ratification.
The Loan is expected to be fully committed by mid-1983 and disbursed by August
1984.
Loan 1470:      Fourth Power (Fortuna Hydroelectric) Project:  US$42 Million
Loan of July 1, 1977; Date of Effectiveness: February 8, 1978;
Closing Date: December 31, 1983.
All major contracts have been awarded. The underground civil works have
suffered delays in the excavation work largely resulting from unforeseen
geological problems in the tunnels and underground cavern. The project is now
expected to be completed in October 1984 with a delay of some 16 months.
Management and supervision of the project have improved considerably.
Construction of the dam has now been completed and procurement of equipment and
transmission are proceeding satisfactorily. There is a substantial increase in
(          the project cost because of the change in the powerhouse design, and the longer
construction period. The cost overrun is approximately US$162 million, or 73
percent of the original cost estimates, excluding interest during construction
and preparatory work for a second stage project.  A supplementary loan of
US$31.3 million was approved on March 29, to help in financing the increase in
cost.     The IDB is also providing a supplementary loan and  co-financing from
other sources is being arranged for the balance. The project remains
economically justified in spite of the substantial cost increase.
1/  These notes are designed to inform the Executive Directors regarding the
progress of projects in execution, and in particular to report any problems
which are being encountered and the action being taken to remedy them. They
do not purport to present a balanced evaluation of strengths and weaknesses
in project execution.

Loan 1565:      Highway Maintenance Project:  US$12 Million Loan of June 30,
1978; Date of Effectiveness:  October 2, 1978; Closing Date:
December 31, 1983.
The project started about one year behind schedule due to delays in field-
ing a team of consultants to provide technical and management assistance to
MOP. A group of six experts is presently completing the final phases of these
services while additional assistance in equipment and workshop management, as
well as training is being financed under Loan 2020-PAN. The project is once
again progressing steadily. Following testing in two pilot provinces,
nationwide implementation of standard maintenance procedures and a new
maintenance management system started in 1981, but was stalled for almost one
year due to lack of priority accorded to systematic management by the previous
MOP management. Procurement of maintenance equipment and mechanics tools is
complete and the last orders are currently being placed for both fast moving
spare parts for equipment purchased under the project, as well as for spare
parts to complete overhaul of 72 units under an ongoing program. All orders are
expected to be placed by June 30, 1983.
Loan 1641:      Development Banking Project:  US$15 Million Loan of January 23,
1979; Date of Effectiveness: September 25, 1979; Closing Date:
June 30, 1983.
The loan only became effective on September 25, 1979 because of delays in
obtaining Government guarantees covering COFINA's exposure in several enter-
prises in excess of the limits stipulated in COFINA's Policy Statement. The
problem was resolved . The Loan is now fully committed, except for a small
portion of a US$1.0 million component for small scale enterprise lending through
the Ministry of Commerce and Industry. Restructuring and reorganization of
COFINA is being considered.
Loan 1672:      Tropical Tree Crop Development Project:  US$19 Million Loan of
April 25, 1979; Date of Effectiveness:  July 25, 1979;
Closing Date: June 30, 1985.
The coffee and cocoa components are proceeding satisfactorily. The banana
component has suffered delays because of a change in management in one of the
key implementing organizations, the Banana Corporation of the Pacific (COBAPA)
and two consecutive bad harvests in 1979 and 1980 which led to a deterioration               )
of its finances and technical capability. The Ministry of Agriculture has been
trying to resolve the problems, and cancellation of this component is being
considered. Undisbursed funds for this component would be reallocated to the
Coffee and Cocoa component for which consultants are being contracted. The oil
palm component is also facing some problems, but with the appointment of a new
project director and the assistance of consultants, it is expected that there
will be an improvement in project execution generally. The Bank is monitoring
the situation.

Loan 1778       Fifth Power Project:  US$23 Million Loan of January 30, 1980;
Date of Effectiveness: April 22, 1980; Closing Date
December 31, 1983.
Under the direction of a new project manager, project execution is
progressing satisfactorily. The delays experienced at the beginning have been
compensated and completion is expected in March 1984, only 3 months behind
schedule.  A cost overrun of about 30 percent over appraisal estimate is being
financed from IRHE's own resources.
(        Loan 1878:      Colon Urban Development Project: US$35 Million Loan of
August 7, 1980; Date of Effectiveness: August 14, 1980;
Closing Date: June 30, 1984.
Execution of the housing component was delayed by changes in type and
location of some of the housing units proposed by the Government. Implementa-
tion, according to the modified proposal, which has been approved by the Bank,
is proceeding well but behind schedule. The port expansion and the Technical
Assistance components are also making satisfactory progress, and the development
of the commercial area in the Free Zone continues to progress. Phase I of the
road component has been completed and Phase II is substantially completed and
scheduled to be opened to traffic shortly. Structural works for phase III are
due to start in May. Other minor components are proceeding satisfactorily after
initial delays. However, the employment generation component (the industrial
estate) may fall short of appraisal expectations due to reduced demand and
delays in implementation, which may require substantial modifications in the
component. Efforts are being made to resolve existing problems and developments
are being closely monitored.
Loan 1954:     Energy Planning and Petroleum Exploration Promotion Project:
US$6.5 Million Loan of April 23, 2981; Date of Effectiveness:
July 21, 1981; Closing Date: December 31, 1984.
All main studies provided under the Energy Planning and Auditing components
have been or are being completed, including substantial training of CONADE
staff. A National Energy Strategy Paper by CONADE will be available for Bank
review shortly.  However, appointment of the petroleum and coal exploration
consultants has been delayed. The Government is reassessing investment
priorities and has put a hold on contracting of consulting services for all
exploration activities under the project.  Implementation of all project
exploration components is about 20 months behind schedule. Discussions will be
held with the Government as soon as possible to clarify future implementation of
these components and the future status of CONADE.

Loan 1955       Second Development Banking Project; US$20 Million Loan of
April 22, 1981; Date of Effectiveness: July 21, 1981;
Closing Date: June 30, 1985.
There is active demand from entrepreneurs and more than 50 percent of the
loan is already committed. However, progress of this project is less than
satisfactory: loan collections are low and arrears are rather high and a
substantial portion of COFINA's portfolio may not be recovered. During the
first half of 1982, COFINA had three different general managers and almost all
management positions were changed recently in an attempt to improve COFINA's
public image. Complete restructuring and reorganization of COFINA is being
considered.                                                                                   )
Loan 2020:      Road Rehabilitation Project; US$19 Million Loan of July 24, 1981;
Date of Effectiveness: October 13, 1981; Closing Date:
December 31, 1985.
Due to initial delays resulting from two changes of the Ministry of Public
Work's management, the project is about a year behind schedule. Under the
present MOP management implementation is improving. Detailed engineering for
the first year's roadworks is now almost complete. Rehabilitation of three road
sections has been contracted and a fourth contract awarded, with bid invitations
for five more contracts expected during the next two months. Bids are also
being invited for an agreed list of quarry equipment and orders have been placed
for spare parts needed to overhaul several crushing plants. Engaging a
consulting firm to provide technical assistance for management of equipment and
workshops is being seriously delayed due to administrative obstacles. However,
other consultants are presently assisting MOP in starting a training program.
The Bank is monitoring the situation.
Loan 2182:      Second Port Project; US$24.4 Million Loan of September 15, 1982;
Date of Effectiveness: December 15, 1982; Closing Date:
December 31, 1986.
Consultant and staff appointments have been completed and procurement
action is underway. The tariff study has been completed and a new tariff
structure became effective on April 1, 1983.
Loan 2222:      Second Water Supply and Sewerage Project; US$21.6 Million Loan
of February 17, 1983; Date of Effectiveness: April 7, 1983;
Closing Date: December 31, 1988.
This loan became effective on April 7, 1983.
