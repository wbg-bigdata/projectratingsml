INTERNATIONAL DEVELOPMENT ASSOCIATION
REPORT AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT
TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS ON A PROPOSED CREDIT
TO THE ISLAMIC REPUBLIC OF MAURITANIA
FOR AN IRRIGATION ENGINEERING PROJECT
1.        I submit the following report and recommendation on a proposed
development credit to the Islamic Republic of Mauritania for the equivalent
of US$1.1 million to help finance an irrigation engineering project. The
credit would have a term of ten years, including two years of grace, with a
service charge of 3/4 of one percent per annum. The credit would be refinanced
under any later credit that the Bank Group might make for the irrigation
project itself.
PART I: THE ECONOMY
2.        Based upon the findings of an economic mission to Mauritania in
February/March 1973, a report entitled "The Current Economic Situation and
Prospects of Mauritania" (243-MAU) will be distributed to the Executive Di-
rectors on May 10, 197h. Country data sheets aDpear as Annex I.
3.        Mauritania is not an integrated economic unit.   It consists of
three isolated economic centers: the modern mining and fish processing
industries in the northwest around Nouadhibou, the capital city of Nouakchott,
and the livestock and agricultural activities in the South. This latter is
one of the poorest regions in the world and forms, with the western part of
Mali and the northeastern part of Senegal, an almost entirely closed economic
system. Between the Nouadhibou region and the south, the capital city of
Nouakchott, built since 1960 in a semi-desert region with no natural resources
and no basic infrastructure, is only an administrative center and a port.
4.        In the past, Mauritania's main political and economic links were
with France and the French speaking African countries south of the Sahara.
But recently it has established close relations with North Africa and the
Arab League countries. In June 1972, it asked for the revision of the 1961
Cooperation Treaty with France in the economic, monetary, technical, cultural,
and military fields, and a new agreement was reached in February 1973, except
for monetary affairs. As a result, Mauritania left the W4est African Monetary
Union and the franc zone and introduced its own currency, the ouguiya, in
June of that year. However, it still wishes to keep and develop economic
ties with all its West African neighbors and is a member of the West African
Economic Community, which replaced the West African Customs Union (UDEAO) in
January 1974.



- 2 -
5.        The factors limiting economic growth in Mauritania are many.     First,
the country is one of the poorest in terms of natural resources, except for
iron ore and fish, and its climate is one of the most difficult, even among
the Sahelian countries, as its most southern regions (about 7 percent of the
country) do not receive more than 400-600 mm. of rain per annum. Second,
distances are great and transport to all but a few places is arduous and costly;
for example, freight schedules for the journey from Nouakchott (in the west)
to Nema (in the east) allow nine days each way for a journey of less than 900
miles. Under such circumstances, the exchange of food products between the
surplus and deficit areas is limited and production incentives are considerably
decreased. Third, adult literacy in the country is low, while primary school
enrollment does not exceed 15 percent of the school-age population.
Past Economic Performance
6.        Between 1960 and 1968, the Mauritanian economy grew in real terms
at 10-11 percent annually. This was mainly due to a rapid expansion in the
mining sector. Although little of the value added generated in the modern
sector spilled over into rural areas, per capita income of the rural poor has
increased at about three percent annually in the first half of the 1960's.
From 1969 to 1972, overall economic growth slowed down to three to four percent
per year as mining companies reached their capacity and as a result of a series
of severe droughts, unprecedented in this centurv.
7.        Mauritania was particularly affected by these droughts.    Agricultural
production decreased by about 60 percent in 1972, while the cattle herd was
reduced by an estimated 40 percent between 1969 and 1973. This wiped out all
the progress made in the rural sector in the early sixties and further widened
the gap between per capita incomes in the traditional (US$70) and modern sectors
(US$750). In spite of the substantial effort undertaken by the international
community to provide emergency aid to Mauritania, the consequences of the
drought will be felt for many years to come in the form of: i) lower output
in the livestock sector; ii) a difficult public finance situation as a result
of new demands on the national budget for the food relief operation and social
and health services; iii) social problems created by the concentration of
refugees around the emergency food supply centers; iv) malnutrition and starv-
ation resulting in higher death rates among children and older people and causing
a marked increase in the incidence of physical and mental damage among the sur-
viving children.
Strategy for Economic Development and Public Investments
8.        The Government's economic policy in the first decade of independence
focused on the development of infrastructure in an effort to equip Mauritania
with a modern capital and the facilities needed to run the country. The
infrastructure development effort also aimed at decreasing the dependence of
Mauritania on Senegal for the transport of goods in and out of the country.
Thus, about 80 percent of public investments between 1963 and 1972 were absorbed
by projects in transport and urban infrastructure. Public investments increased
at about nine percent per annum in current prices during this period to reach



- 3 -
an annual average of US$19 million in 1968-72, or 7.8 percent of GDP. Besides
the general constraints on economic development mentioned in para 5, plan
implementation has suffered from the limited capacity of government services
to identify, prepare, and execute projects. The technical ministries
and the planning department are understaffed and not adequately equipped to
set priorities or analyze and prepare investment projects.
9.        Future growth in the modern sector is essential to improve the
public finance situation and provide a substantial part of the revenues needed
to finance investment and recurrent expenditures for the development of the
rural sector. However, even if the contemplated substantial new investments
for the Guelbs iron ore mines are undertaken (a continuation of the present
MIFERMA operation), mining alone cannot provide employment for more than a
very small fraction of Mauritania's active population and its indirect effects
on the rest of the economy will continue to remain limited. Similarly,
establishment of manufacturing industries--so far strongly supported by the
Government--cannot provide the answer to the question of raising the standard
of living for the mass of the Mauritanian population, as high production and
transport costs and small local markets severely limit possibilities. The
Government's basic strategy therefore should be to develop the country's few
natural resources in livestock, agriculture, arabic gum and fisheries. Although
details of the Government's investment program for the Third Plan period (1975-79)
are not yet known, indications are that a much larger share of public invest-
ments will be devoted to the rural sector than in the past, as shown by the
number of projects presently under preparation in this sector. The development
of irrigated agriculture in particular is expected to play an important role in
ensuring that the consequences of a recurrence of the recent droughts would not
be so drastic. Two irrigation projects totalling several thousand hectares
are already underway. In addition to the Gorgol project, other irrigation
programs are being considered in the context of the development of the Senegal
River Basin.
Financing Public Investment
10.       The public finance situation improved markedly in the 1960s.    From
a negative US$7 million in 1960, budgetary savings reached a positive US$5
million in 1972 or about 15 percent of Central Government revenues. Public
savings (after debt amortization) financed about 20 percent of the public
investment program in the past three years, the rest being financed by foreign
aid (US$15 million per annum). During this period, the Bank has been the
third largest aid donor (providing about 18 percent of Mauritania's external
capital assistance), after France (21 percent) and the European Communities
(19 percent). About 70 percent of foreign development assistance financed
transport and urban infrastructure. Also important was technical assistance,
mainly in education, which amounted to US$5.2 million per annum in the past
three years, mostly financed by French bilateral assistance and UNDP. Conditions
of foreign aid have progressively hardened with the share of grant aid decreasing



- 4 -
from 100 percent in the early sixties to about 35 percent in 1970-72, although
the terms of the loans have remained soft. The external public debt outstand-
ing as of December 1972 amounted to US$36.4 million; the average interest rate
was 3.8 percent. The debt service ratio remains low (3-4 percent).
Prospects 1/
11.       Even assuming normal rainfall conditions, growth in the rural sector
will at best reach an estimated 2-3 percent per annum for the rest of the
decade, and would be well belowx this level should there be a recurrence of
the drought. Therefore, the standard of living on a per capita basis in the
rural sector cannot be expected to reach its 1968 level again before the early
1980s as the effects of the investments planned in this sector will only be
felt after a substantial lag. The modern sector rate of growth during the
same period could reach about five percent, a small decline from the perform-
ance of the past four vears. This is mainly due to the fact that mining
production which stagnated between 1969 and 1972, but increased again in the
last two years, is expected to remain at its 1974 level until MIFERMA begins
exploiting low grade iron ore deposits at Guelbs. As a result, economic
growth for the country as a whole could reach about four percent between
1971/72 and 1980.
12.       The need to broaden the base of economic development appears to
justify fully the Government's plans to increase public investment from
US$19 million equivalent in 1968-72 to US$28 million per annum in the Third
Plan (1975-79). Assuming tight budgetary policies, combined with a substan-
tial increase in current expenditures in productive sectors, public savings
could perhaps reach 13 percent of Central Government revenues or an annual
US$9.5 million over the Third Plan period. However, public debt amortization
will probably absorb about 40 percent of public savings. On that basis,
public savings could not finance more than 20 percent of the public invest-
ment program, and foreign aid would have to cover at least 90 percent of the
cost of each individual project eligible for foreign financing, including the
financing of some local expenditures. The projected low government contribu-
tion toward financing public investments underestimates the development effort
of the countrv. Over the coming years, the Government is expected to make
avail-able considerably more resources for current development expenditures
than in the past. For instance, if one takes into account recurrent expen-
ditures in the rural and transport sectors, the Government's share in the
financing of total public development outlays during 1975-79 could reach
25 percent.
13.       On the basis of the assumptions made in the preceding paragraph,
implementation of the proposed public investment program will require an
increase in foreign aid of about 50 percent over 1969-72 levels. The World
1/   This section was written before the recent revisions in commodity price
forecasts and therefore it does not include the effects of these revisions
on the prospects of the economy. This analysis will be undertaken very
shortly.



- 5 -
Bank Group, FED, France, the People's Republic of China and several Arab
countries are likely to be the main donors. The projected increase in foreign
aid appears to be a reasonable target and is entirely justified particularly
considering the extreme poverty of Mauritania's rural population after several
years of drought. For the same reason and in view of the limited public
savings likely to be available for the rest of the seventies, most of public
inflows should be on soft terms. Assunming that Mauritania continues to borrow
on very favorable terms, the debt service ratio would remain around 4 percent
in the coming years. Borrowing on harder terms would seriously endanger the
public finance situation.
PART II: BANK GROUP OPERATIONS IN MAURITANIA
14.       The Bank Group has had 7 operations in Mauritania to date.   Total
lending amounts to US$106.2 million, including one Bank loan of US$66 million
for the MIFERMA iron ore mining operation in 1960, five IDA credits, totalling
US$20.2 million, and one IFC operation of US$20.0 million for the development
of copper mining in 1968. Two credits were for projects in the transport
sector (US$6.7 million in FY 1966 for the road Nouakchott-Rosso and US$3.0
million in FY 1969 for a four-year road improvement and maintenance program),
two in the rural sector (US$4.2 million for livestock development in FY 1972
and US$2.5 million for a Drought Relief Fund Project in FY 1974), and one for
education (US$3.8 million, also in FY 1974). Annex II contains a summary
statement of Bank loans, IDA credits, and IFC investments as of March 31,
1974, and notes on the execution of on-going projects.
15.       The Iron Ore Mining and the 1966 Road Construction   projects have
been fully disbursed. Of the remaining projects, the First Road Maintenance
Project (FY 1969) is progressing satisfactorily. All equipment is in operation
according to appraisal schedule. The remaining funds for training will be
entirely disbursed by mid-1974, at which time a follow-up project should be
ready for Board consideration. With respect to the Livestock Development
Project (FY 1972), the start-up of the vaccination and firebreak components
was delayed by about one year to the fall of '1973, as animals left the project
area and pastures were destroyed due to the recent drought. The well component
subproject is now progressing satisfactorily, after some delays in equipment
delivery. The remaining constraint, limited availability of trained personnel,
is expected to be substantially alleviated by forthcoming hiring under the
project of specialized technical assistants. The Drought Relief Fund Project,
is progressing satisfactorily: bidding documents have been issued with IDA
approval for the subprojects dealing with vegetable production and small irriga-
tion schemes, while the feasibility study for the cattle production center is
well underway. The credit for the education project, signed on February 11,
1974, is not yet effective.
16.       In line with the development strategy outlined in paragraph 10,
the primary objectives of the Bank Group operations in Mauritania are to
help the Government (i) build a base for economic development outside the
mining sector, particularly by developing the potential of the rural sector



- 6 -
and decreasing its vulnerability to drought; and (ii) increase the country's
absorptive capacity, one of the major constraints to Mauritania's development,
by developing its educational/training svstem and making it more relevant to
the country's needs. These objectives will be pursued while continuing to
support, first, the development of mining activities which are essential to
strengthen the fiscal and balance of payments positions of the country and,
second, the development of transport infrastructure which is a prerequisite
to promoting agricultural development in remote rural areas. Due to the
extreme poverty of the country, its verv difficult climate, large distances,
an insufficient transport network, and a lack of trained personnel at all
levels, project preparation and implementation particularly in the rural
sector has proved much more time consuming than anticipated. However, the
efforts made by the Bank Group are starting to bear fruit, as indicated by
the fact that it has been possible to present two projects to the Board in
FY 74 (besides the Drought Relief Project) and the progress made on projects
which we hope to present to the Board in FY 1975, i.e., a second Road Mainte-
nance Project and the Nouadhibou Port Extension Project. The latter will
substantially increase the participation of Mauritania in the exploitation
of its fish reserves.
17.       As of December 1973, the Bank Group held 25 percent of Mauritania's
external public debt (disbursed) of US$39 million. This proportion is expected
to remain at about that level during the remainder of the 1970s. The Bank
Group accounted for about 3 percent of total debt service payments in 1973.
This ratio is expected to increase slowly in the coming years to reach about
10 percent by the mid-eighties.
PART III: TILE RURAL SECrOR IN MAURITANIA
Past Performance
is.       The rural sector in Mauritania includes about 85 percent of the
cotntry's population, yet accounted during 1969-1972 for only one-third of
GDP. Most of the sector's production consists of livestock products; crop
production represents less than 20 percent of the rural output, or 6 percent
of GDP. The bulk of crop production consists of millet and sorghum (75,000
tons/yr under normal rainfall conditions), niebes (6,000 tons), and maize
(4,000 tons); 75 percent of crops are grown under a system of flood recession
cropping in the flood plain of the Senegal River and 25 percent under rainfed
cond'tion. Mauritania also produces about 12,000 tons of dates annually and
very small amounts of wheat, barley, vegetables and groundnuts. Rice culti-
vation has started more recently and production reached 2,000 tons in 1972.
It is estimated that under normal rainfall conditions, domestic production
covers about 60 percent of the country's annual cereal requirements. In the
past few years, however, agricultural production has fallen sharply as a
result of drought and it is estimated that the production drop in 1972/73
was as much as 60 percent; this meant semi-starvation for a large proportion
of the rural population.



7-
Obstacles to Development
19.       The poor performance of Mauritania's agricultural sector can be
attributed to a wide range of constraints. Ecological conditions impose
severe limitations on the number of crops which can be cultivated economically.
Rainfall is limited and unevenly distributed and drought common and occasion-
ally, as now, of disastrous proportion; flood levels of the Senegal River are
irregular, making it impractical to employ low cost irrigation by controlled
flooding; and within 200 km of the sea, salt water backs up during the dry
season making the river water unusable for irrigation. Physical character-
istics of the country make transportation difficult and costly, and exchanges
of goods between surplus and deficit areas are extremely limited. Human
resources are also limited and at present most human effort is diverted to
assuring mere survival. The education level of farmers is low, health and
nutrition are poor, infant mortality is high, and physical resistance is low
due to the poor control of such endemic diseases as malaria and urinary
schistosomiasis. Socially, efforts to reallocate land and to modernize here-
tofore antiquated agricultural techniques are often complicated by a rigid
land tenure system. Finally, Government budgetary allocations for agriculture
have been inadequate.
Development Strategy
20.       There is some potential in Mauritania for the intensification of
rainfed millet and sorghum cultivation. This could be achieved in the south-
eastern region by introducing extension credit, and marketing services, and
through improving feeder roads and water supplies. The Government has identi-
fied such a project which is under preparation. Although the feasibility
study has yet to be completed, indications are that such a project, if well
managed, could lead to some increases in production levels and in the standard
of living of the area's agricultural population as a whole.
21.       However, the improvement of rainfed crop cultivation does not offer
a solution to Mauritania's agricultural problems; areas with sufficient rain-
fall for rainfed crop production are far too limited in extent. Consequently,
any major improvement in the sector will depend primarily on the development
of controlled irrigation to produce cereals and other crops as well as crop
residues and fodder for livestock feed. Since 1961, several small pumping
schemes have been installed along the Senegal River, and these now cover some
400 ha of rice. These schemes were inadequately prepared, organized and
funded and most have now fallen into disrepair. They are now being rehabili-
tated, equipped with appropriate institutional arrangements and expanded to
1,000 ha with financing by FED and IDA (Drought Relief Fund Credit - 444-MAU).
The only major irrigation project so far initiated is the 4,000 ha M'Pourie
project near Rosso, started in 1969/70 with bilateral aid from the People's
Republic of China. Some 500 ha have been developed to date, and yields have
averaged more than 4.0 tons/ha of paddy per crop. The remainder of the scheme
is expected to be developed at the rate of 600 ha per annum.



- 3 -
22.       For the future, regulation of the Senegal River, an objective sought
jointly by Mauritania, Senegal and Mali in the context of the Organization for
the Development of the Senegal River Basin (OMVS), would permit controlled
year-round irrigation of about 300,000 ha on both sides of the river; of this
about 60 - 70,000 ha would be in Mauritania. Two principal regulatory dams
are under study; a storage dam at '1anantali (estimated to cost US$100 million)
on the Bafing, a tributary of the Senegal River in Mali; and the Delta dam
(US$30 million) near Rosso, which would prevent salt water intrusion from
the sea at low river flow, as well as provide complementary water storage.
lIowever, the implementation of these projects will take a long time and
involve very high levels of expenditure. Estimates indicate an overall cost
in 1973 prices of over US$3,000 per ha develciped, when the cost of dams is
included.  In the meantime, Mauritania, while actively participating in the
efforts of OMtVS to develop the Senegal River Basin, has identified a number
of irrigation projects which can be implemented more rapidly since they do
not require the involvement of neighboring countries and because the total
cost of individual projects is moderate. Among such projects, the Gorgol
!Basin Development Scheme has been given the highest priority.
PART IV: TIE PROJECT
23.       The proposed engineering project provides for the execution of the
engineering studies needed for the implementation of the first phase of the
Gorgol Basin Development Scheme; the carrying out of related health and
education studies; the preparation of final designs, tender documents and
technical schedules; assistance to the Government in bid evaluation; and
technical assistance to the Ministry of Planning for the analysis of rural
development projects.
2/i.      Corgol r,asin Development Scheme.  At the Government's request, in
1970, 1!NDP financed preparation of a master plan for the development of the
entire Corgol Valley and a feasibility study of a first phase project. The
plan and study were reviewed by the Bank in 1973 and found satisfactory.
True laster plan concludes that full utilization of the Gorgol River would
eventually permit the irrigation of about 9,500 ha, and proposes that this
be developed in three phases. Because of the remoteness of the project site
and the uncertainty attached to preliininary cost estimates, it was decided
that appraisal of the Gorgol project by the Bank would be possible only after
completion of the final engineering studies and submission of bids for civil
works construction. Appraisal of the dngineering project discussed in this
report took place in D)ecember 1973 and negotiations were held on April 15
and 16, 1974. The Mauritania delegation at these negotiations was led by
Mr. Ba, Director of the Plan. A credit and project summary is attached as
Annex III. There is no separate appraisal report for this project.
25.       A number of characteristics of the Gorgol Valley explain the priority
it was given by the Government for the development of irrigated agriculture.
The Corgol River is the principal tributary of the Senegal River in 14auritania



- 9 -
and its valley extends over about 35,000 ha. The valley is regularly flooded
bv both the Gorgol and Senegal Rivers. This flooding permits cultivation of
8,000 ha of crops, mainly sorghulm, under a flood recession system (the crop
is planted as the flood recedes, and grows and matures through utilizing the
residual soil moisture). Yields are very low, averaging about 0.3 ton/ha
because of a generally inadequate water supply. It is estimated that more
than three-quarters of the area to be developed ultimately for irrigation
is not presently cultivated because of excessive flooding; thus problems of
land reallocation, which are now being studied, are not expected to be sig-
nificant.
26.       D)evelopment of the Gorgol Valley will be phased.   Phase I would
involve the development of 3,500 ha for double-crop rice cultivation over a
ten-year period, from the beginning of the investment period to full develop-
ment. Subsequently, Phase II would provide for the development, between
vears ten and fifteen of the project, of an additional 3,000 ha of rice.
Phase III is envisaged as consisting of the eventual development of an addi-
tional 3,000 ha for suigar cane and other crops in the late 1980s. This quite
slow pace of development is predicated on the limited experience in Mauritania
of modern irrigation andI existing logistical and manpower constraints; how-
ever, if shown feasible, the pace of development in respect of the second
and third phases could be accelerated.
27.       Basic infrastructure works required for Phase I would consist of
two small earth dams for water retention and flood protection (the Foum-Gleita
dam on the Gorgol Noir and the El-Bir dam on the Gorgol Blanc), and two pro-
tective dikes. WIater storage made available by these dams would suffice for
cdeveloping Phases II and III. Phase II would only require elongation of the
northern protective dike, construction of irrigation networks and land develop-
ment on 3,000 ha.   Additional protective infrastructure would be required for
Phase  III.  Preliminary estimates indicate that construction costs for
Phases I and II would total about US$17.5 million for the development of
6,500 ha (UIS$2,700 per ha) of which some US$11 million would be expended on
the construction of Phase I (Annex IV).
28.       The success of the Gorgol Basin Development Schleme will depend on
experienced and effective management, the efficient provision of support
services to farmers, and the timely supply of inputs. To gain experience,
particularly of the social problems involved in a shift from primnitive
traditional agriculture to modern irrigated cultivation, a 700 ha pilot
project would be undertaken prior to Phase I.    The pilot project would be
adjacent to the site of the Gorgol scheme and would be irrigated by pumping
fronm the Senegal River. The final design of the pilot project has been financed
by UNDP, and FrD has indicated its interest in financing the project itself
which would cost about US$3 million.   Implementation could begin as early as
Decenmber 1974.

29.       Implementation of the Gorgol Easini Development Scheme will consti-
tiLte a major effort for the Government, especially in terms of manpower and
budgetary allocations.   Thiese aspects wili be studied under the proposed
engineeriip project. As far as senior manpower is concerned, it is envisaged
that Mauritanians, presently being trained abroad or who will undergo such
training in the near future, will progressively replace the foreign technical
assistance which will be needed in the first years of the project. With the
expansion of the existing NIDP-financed agricultural school at Kaedi, the
training of extension service agents should pose no particular problems.
Finally, Mauritania's deficient supporting infrastructure is expected to be
considerably improved in the southern regions by the Second Ilighway Mainte-
nance Project, now in its final stages of preparation by the Bank Group-.
The Engineering Project
30.       The Engineering Project to be financed with the proposed IDA credit
would comprise employing consultants to assist the Government to:
a.   conduct topographic surveys and geophysical and
geo-technical investigations;
b.   conduct hydrological measurements of the Gorgol Blanc
and Gorgol Noir Rivers;
c.   prepare final designs and tender documents for the
development of the 3,500 ha Phase I of the Gorgol River
Basin Development Scheme;
d.   prepare technical schedules, including cost estimates, for
the operation and maintenance of the proposed irrigation
and drainage networks and for the construction of storage
buildings and a rice mill required for the implementation of
Phase I;
e.   prequalify bidders, evaluate bids and award contracts for
Plhase I;
f.   study the irpact of the proposed irrigated development on
health conditions;
g.   study the manpower and educational requirements needed for
the efficient implementation of both the Gorgol Basin
Development Scheme and other irrigation projects presently
under preparation in Mauritania; and
h.   assist the Ministry of Planning in the economic and financial
analyses of rural development projects by the provision of one
agro-economist for a two-year period.



31.       Execution and Timing.   The Director of Rural Public Works of the
Ministry of Rural Development would be responsible for supervising the imple-
mentation of the Project. As the French consulting firm SCET International
satisfactorily executed the Gorgol feasibility study and master plan, and as
SCET is also engaged in the final design of the pilot project (para. 28), the
Government has proposed that this firm undertake the engineering studies to be
financed under the credit. Given the experience acquired by SCET International
through several years of studies in the project area, and the delays that would
be incurred in the course of inviting proposals from other firms, we agree with
the Government's position. A draft contract has been drawn up between the
Government and SCET, the terms and conditions of which are satisfactory and
acceptable to the Association. SCET has already initiated work in the project
area under a letter of intent issued by the Government. This early start was
dictated by climatic conditions which, for field survey work, are most suitable
in the period January to May.
32.       It is estimated that the Gorgol Engineering Project including its
technical assistance component would be completed in about 2 1/2 years, and
require (excluding field surveys) a total of 14.4 man-years of professional
expertise. Field work would be completed by June 1974 and final designs and
bidding documents would be ready for final review by September 30, 1974.
Prequalification of bidders, essential due to the complexity of the works,
would be executed concurrently, allowing invitations to bid to be issued in
November 1974. Bid openings would follow after 90 days, and allow their
examination in March 1975. Appraisal of the Phase I project would be possible
immediatelv thereafter and could permit award of the contract for civil works
in late 1975. Allowing for a five-month mobilization period, this could permit
work to start in April 1976 (Chart 8319).
33.       Cost Estimates and Financing.   Total cost of the project, net of
taxes, is estimated at US$1.3 million with a foreign exchange component of
US$1,043,000 (83 percent) based on the quotation obtained for the engineering
contract. Detailed cost estimates are provided in Annex III. The proposed
IDA credit of US$1.1 million would finance the foreign exchange costs of the
project plus some local costs, or an aggregate of 87 percent of total project
costs, net of taxes. The credit would finance retroactively up to US$280,000
for expenditures incurred after January 15, 1974 on consultant services.
34.       The proposed IDA credit would be for a term of ten years, including
a two-year grace period. The borrower would be the Government of Mauritania.
The credit would be refinanced under any credit that the Bank Group might make
for Phase I of the Gorgol Basin Development Scheme.
35.       Disbursement.   The credit would be disbursed against 100 percent of
total expenditures for consultant services rendered in relation to the engi-
neering, health and education studies, 80 percent of the technical assistance
to the Ministry of Planning, and 38 percent of total expenditures for com-
plementary surveys and investigations to be carried out by Government services.

36.       Benefits and Justification.   The justification for proceeding with
the credit for the engineering project is that tentative estimates indicate
a satisfactory internal economic return from investment in the Gorgol Basin
Development Scheme. With an annual yield of about 8 tons of paddy per ha
from two crops, Phase I development of the Gorgol Valley would provide about
18,000 tons of rice per annum, and Phase I and II combined about 34,000 tons.
The latter would account for almost 20 percent of Mauritania's current
cereal consumption and for more than 30 percent of annual cereal import
requirements. The internal economic return of Phase I has been estimated at
12.9 percent, and that of Phase I and II combined at 14.6 percent. This
calculation assumes that the price of rice 1/ will decrease to about US$2071
metric ton by 1980 (having reached an all time high of US$350 per metric ton
in 1974) and will remain constant thereafter. Sensitivity tests indicate
that, even if investment and recurrent costs rise by 15 and 25 percent res-
pectively, the internal economic return of Phases I and II combined would
remain at about 10 percent (Annex IV). Benefit/cost calculations for Phase
III are not advanced enough to include them in the above analysis. However,
there is no reason to believe that the return for the overall scheme of
9,500 ha would be lower than that of Phases I and II combined.
37.       It is estimated that about 7,000 farmers and their families could
benefit from the development of the first phase of the project and thereby
increase their standard of living from one of precarious subsistence at
present to one where the family food supply would be-assured even in drought
years. The project would therefore substantially contribute to-reducing the
risk of starvation which has plagued a large proportion of the rural population
in the southeastern region in recent years.
PART V: LEGAL INSTRUMENTS AND AUTHORITY
38.       The draft Development Credit Agreement between the Islamic Republic
of Mauritania and the Association, the Recommendation of the Committee pro-
vided for in Article V, Section 1 (d) of the Articles of Agreement of the
Association and the text of a draft resolution approving the proposed. credit
are being distributed to the Executive Directors separately.
39.       The draft Development Credit Agreement provides that the effective-
ness of the Development Credit is conditional upon the signing of the contract
for the engineering services between the Government and the consultants
(Section 7.01 (a) of the Credit Agreement), and the appointment of the Project
Director (Section 7.01 (b) of the Credit Agreement).
40.       I am satisfied that the proposed credit would comply with the Articles
of Agreement of the Association.

C.   Projects in Execution -
Cr. ',o. 159-1AU  First Road Maintenance Project:   US$3.0 million; Credit
Agreement: June 26, 1969; Closing Date: December 31, 1974
This project is progressing satisfactorily except with respect to
tilC inability of the Government to assign a sufficient number of counterpart
personnel to the team of consultants as a result of a general shortage of
miiddle and upper level local personnel. This problem is being solved by the
training abroad (under the project and with the assistance of UNDP) of a
number of local personnel. For the rest, alL equipment is now in operation
according to appraisal schedule. The remnaining funds for training will be
fully disbursed by mid-1974 at which time a follow-up project shouid&be
ready for Board consideration.
Cr. No. 974-1MAU Livestock Development Project; US$4.15 million; credit
Agreement:   December 17, 1971; Closing Date:   December 31, 1976
The project provides for (i) construction and maintenance of wells,
(ii) operation of animal health campaigns and (iMi) firebreaks in an area
covering about half of Mauritania's population.    The start-up of project items8
(ii) andI (iii) was oostponed to the fall of 1973 or by about one year
following the recent drought since animals temporarily left the project area
and pastures were destroyed. In the meantime, a number of measures were
taken (survey of vaccination vards, delivery of equipment for firebreak
maintenance) which made for a more rapid start in the implementation of these
two components in late 1973. With respect to project item (i), some delays
were incurred due to the use of inadequate equipment for the survey of 20
wells to serve as a basis for the preparation of tender documents for the
reconstruction and repair of approximately 300 wells. This defect was cor-
rected bv the consultants and this item is now progressing satisfactorily.
All equipment ordered so far is now in nlace. The remaining constraint to
a rapid implementation of the project in the coming months will be the Limited
availability of traineci personnel both at the administrative and technical
levels. The forthcoming hiring under the project of a technical assistant
specialized in ndmLnistrative and accounting, matters and of three expatriate
well-diggers is expected to contribute substantially to the solution of this
nroblem.
1/   Thlese notes are designed to inform the Fxecutive Directors regarding
the progress of projects in execution, and in particular to report any
problems which arc being encountered, and the action being taken to
remnedy them.  They should be read in this sense, and with the understand-
ing that they do not purport to present a balanced evaluation of strengths
and weaknesses in project execution.
