PROJECT COMPLETION REPORT
PREFACE
Loan 1447-RO, for the Bucharest Glass Fiber Project, in the
amount of US$18.3 million, was signed in June 1977, and was closed in
December 1980, with US$18.1 million disbursed.
The main objective of the loan was to finance the construction of
a new glass fiber plant in Bucharest, to satisfy the increasing domestic
demand for glass fiber products in Romania.
The Project Completion Report has been prepared by the Industry
Department and the Investment Bank of Romania, based on missions to Romania
in August and December 1982. Chapters II-IV are substantially as prepared
by the Investment Bank.
Comments received from the Borrower, which are included as an
attachment, have been incorporated into the text.
The project has not been audited by the Operations Evaluation

ROMANIA - BUCHAREST GLASS FIBER PROJECT (LOAN 1447-RO)
PROJECT COMPLETION REPORT
HIGHLIGHTS
The project is intended to increase the production of glass fiber
and glass fiber products in the quality required by the electrotechnical
industries and for chemical processing equipment as well as for
wear-resistant and fireproof textiles and furniture. The project, which
represents a major expansion of the Glass Fiber Factory in Bucharest,
includes a glass-making and spinning section with an annual capacity of
6,000 tons of glass fiber produced as yarn and roving, and a weaving and
finishing section where approximately 6 million sq m of fabrics and woven
roving, and 13.3 million m of tapes and tubes are produced. Of the
6,000 tons of glass yarn and roving produced, 1,270 tons/year would be used
for weaving while the balance of 4,730 would be for sale to other domestic
users (para 2.05).
This project was commissioned with 9 months' delay (para 3.08).
The delay was due to difficulties in obtaining offers for the main
technology and equipment package, need for redesigning foundation work for
the furnaces and, most important, the urgent tasks assigned to the civil
works contractor for the rebuilding of industrial areas damaged by the
severe earthquake of 1977. Considering the impact of the earthquake, the
implementation schedule is considered satisfactory.
This project has been able to reach full capacity operation
during commissioning. But production in 1982 was only two thirds of
capacity and full capacity operation is not expected until 1984. This is
mainly as a result of lower consumption and change in type of product
demand (para 4.03). The project has met its main objective to provide
additional glass fiber products of improved quality at reduced cost as well
as training of personnel required for the operation of the new plant.
The project cost amounted to US$35.5 million, 18.6X below
appraisal estimate. This is mainly as a result of substantial reductions
in the cost of local equipment, import duties, erection, engineering and
civil works that compensated some overruns in preoperating, start-up and
training expenses, imported equipment and working capital (para 3.15).
The FRR and ERR for the project were calculated at 24.1X and
19.8% compared to appraisal estimates of 11% and 16.5% (paras 5.04 and
6.02). The higher FRR is due to the lower capital costs, the increase in
product prices and shift towards higher value products. The increased ERR
is mainly due to reduced capital costs, increased production of high-value
items and favorable international price developments for the glass fiber
products.



- vi -
There were no new revelations concerning this project; however,
there were a number of observations related to procurement that confirm
lessons learned in previous projects. Extended negotiations to reduce
prices, obtain maximum information on technology and minimize the foreign
content, as was the case with the main package, could in the long run
discourage foreign suppliers from bidding in Romania. Furthermore, when
local suppliers win each of the packages on which they bid in this project,
it is possible that foreign suppliers may be reluctant to participate in
bidding. Better understanding of Bank procurement guidelines should also
avoid unnecessary misprocurment (para 7.04).



I.   INTRODUCTION
1.01      The Bucharest Glass Fiber Project (the Project) is part of the
overall Romanian plan for the development of the industrial sector through
acquisition of modern technolcgy and maximizing domestic industrial
production. The Project's objective is to increase the production of glass
fiber and glass fiber products in the quality required by the
electrotechnical industries (cable and electrical equipment parts) and for
chemical processing equipment (such as reinforced polyester tubes and
tanks) as well as for wear-resistant and fire-proof textiles and furniture.
1.02      The Project, as is generally the case in Romania, was selected,
prepared and implemented under a three-tier organizational structure
comprising the technical ministry (the Ministry of Light Industry in this
case) at the top, the Industrial Central for Glass and Fine Ceramics (the
Central) in the middle, and the Glass Fiber Yarn and Fabric Enterprise of
Bucharest (the Enterprise) as the lower rung of the hierarchy.
Construction of a facility of the scope of the Project was included in the
1975-80 Five-Year Plan and a techno-economic study was prepared by the
Central and IPIU and after review by the Ministry and the Investment Bank
of Romania (IB), investment in the Project was approved by the Council of
Ministers in October 1976.
1.03      The Project was completed with an average delay of about one
year. The Project commissioning was gradual and some components such as
roving and others were commissioned with shorter delays. The Project was
completed at a lower cost than the appraisal estimate. This underrun is
due largely to a substantial reduction in civil works costs compared to
original estimates.
1.04      Although equipment has been able to reach full capacity operation
during commissioning, production in 1982 was only two-thirds of capacity
and full capacity operation was reached in October 1983. The main reasons
for this slow build-up of output are lower consumption of glass fiber than
estimated and a change in the type of product demand (para 4.04).
II.   PROJECT BACKGROUND
A.   Project Preparation, Appraisal & Approval
2.01      The Government of Romania requested Bank assistance in the
development oI its chemical industry in FY1976.  An identification mission
by the Industry Department 1 visited Romania in April/May 1976, and the
Glass Fiber project (the Project) was one of three selected for further
consideration by the Bank.
1/   At the time of appraisal the Industry Department (the name used
throughout this report) was called Industrial Projects Department.



-2-
2.02      The Industrial Central for the Glass and Fine Ceramics (the
Central), under the Ministry for Light Industries, is responsible for the
planning of production of glass products. This agency, in collaboration
with the Design Institute for Light Industries (IPIU) prepared the
Technical Economic Study for the Project. After review by the Investment
Bank (IB), this study was approved by the Government on October 26, 1976.
2.03      The Project was appraised in November 1976 (Appraisal Report No.
1504-RO dated April 28, 1977) based on preparatory work carried out by the
Central and other agencies (para. 2.01) and, on June 7, 1977, the Executive
Directors approved a loan of US$18.3 million to the Investment Bank (IB)
for on-lending to the Bucharest Glass Fiber Enterprise (the Enterprise).
The Loan became effective on August 11, 1977. Prior to appraisal, the
Government had secured financing for the more conventional part of the
required investment (para. 2.04) but sought Bank assistance and financing
for the part where modern technology was required.
B.   Project bbjective and Description
2.04      The main objective of the Project was to double the country's
fiber glass making capacity to reach 6,000 tons per year (tpy) and, at the
same time, reduce production costs. This involved a change in the process
technology used previously in Romania (para. 2.06), the training of
personnel to utilize efficiently this new technology, and the eventual
shutting down of the existing fiber glass making capacity, but not of the
plants making glass fiber products.
2.05      The Project as appraised included a glass making and spinning
section (Section I) with an annual capacity of 6,000 tons of glass fiber
produced as yarn and roving, and a weaving and finishing section (Section
II), where approximately 6 million square meters (m2) of fabrics and woven
roving, and 13.3 million meters of tapes and tubes were to be produced
annually using 1,270 tons/year of yarn and roving. The balance of 4,730
tons of glass fiber produced in Section I would be for sale to other
domestic users. The Project is located in Bucharest, in an important
industrial zone, where suitable supplies of electric power, steam, water
and natural gas are available.
2.06      The process selected for the production of glass fiber uses
direct drawing from the molten glass in form of strand, which is more
effective than the older drawing system from glass balls (Cmarbles") since
energy consumption is much reduced and the requirement of platinum-rhodium
catalyst and the material losses are also smaller. The licensor, a UK
contractor, has supplied the know-how, engineering and equipment for
Section I and provided technical assistance and personnel training for
commissioning and operating the plant within the guarantees included in the
contract.
2.07      The weaving-finishing section (Section II) uses conventional
technology (building, weaving section, utilities, etc.), similar to that
for other fiber types in the textile industry. The equipment suppliers
trained the personnel needed for this Section and provided technical
assistance during commissioning ensuring that the performance guarantees
for the installed equipment were met.



-3-
2.08      The main raw materials, quartz sand, limestone, calcined alumina,
dolomite and boric acid are locally Available but calcium floride and
sizing products have to be imported. The necessary utilities are provided
from sources outside the factory: electrical power from the natlonal
network, processed steam from a neighboring factory and natural gas from
the main gas supply pipeline in Bucharest. Therefore the supply of raw
materials, energy and other utilities has generally been satlsfactory,
assuring the reliability of the Project's operation.
III. PROJECT IMPLEMENTATION AND MANAGEMENT
A.   Achievement of Project Objectives
3.01      The main objective--improved technology and increased glass fiber
making capacity--has been fundamentally attained and training of the
personnel required for the operation of the new plant and the new process
has been successful.
3.02      There were no changes in the project scope during Implementation
but at present the Central and the Enterprise indicate that they intend to
increase output of yarn by reducing the output of roving. The capacity of
the plant to make glass fiber will remain unchanged but yarn being finer
than roving, volume of spun glass fiber will be smaller than originally
planned.
B.   Project Management
3.03      The Glass Fiber factory (the Enterprise) of Bucharest is
incorporated in the Glass and Fine Ceramics Central, being authorized to
assume direct responsibility to procure local equipment and raw materials
and to recruit and train personnel. Having a good experience in the
implementation of new investment projects the Central delegated part of its
activities regarding Project implementation to some other local specialized
organizations, assuming however the overall responsibility for the final
results.
3.04      The design and engineering for the whole plant (based on the
information and the designs supplied by the technology licensor and the
equipment suppliers) were carried out by IPIU and the responsibility for
procurement of equipment acquired through international competitive bidding
(ICB) procedures was assumed by ICE Romsit (now ICE CMT). Civil works and
equipment erection were executed by the Industrial Construction Trust of
Bucharest. The management of the Enterprise was very active in attempting
to reduce as much as possible the impact of negative factors on the normal
development of the Project implementation, which in one way or another were
not under their control.
C.  Manpower and Training
3.05      The Enterprise employs at present 1,200 people (of which, 830 are
women) including operative, technical and administrative personnel. This
number is the same that was considered at the time of appraisal. During



-4-
Project execution, the number of people employed In construction and
erection works fluctuated between 80 and 260 per day.
3.06      Based on a training program, supervised by the Central, the
Enterprise management formed, from the very beginning of the Project a
number of worker teams using various professional training systems, both in
Romania, In various glass and textile plants, and abroad. The training of
specialists abroad wam carried out with the assistance of the licensing
firm and equipment muppliers. The cost of this program, provided from the
beginning, was Included in the preoperating and start-up expenses. This
cost was approximately USs0.5 million.  The Project anagemnt was
particularly active In assuring sultable conditions for the trallng of the
operating personnel and the building up of the plant staff. Part of the
personnel was recruited already trained from other existing units of the
Central but the new technology required extensive retralning of most of the
operating personnel. During the lmplemntation period of the Project
(1977-1981), 490 persons were tralned, out of which 250 were trained on the
job as glassuaker, locksmiths, mechanics, electriclans and plumbers and
other 240 persons were taken after graduation from vocational school. In
the same period, 25 specialists (16 engineers, 2 foremen and 7 workers)
received training abroad.
D.   Performance of Consultants
3.n7      During the periol of project implementation the specialists from
various equipment suppliers were present on the site. giving up-to-date
Information on the technology and the equipment being used. At the peak of
the Implementation period (1979-19ln), more than 30 experts were on the
site. The experts from the UK licensor were particularly useful in the
erection and testing as well as in their assistance In training personnel
to ensure the successful implementation of the Project. Except for these
technical services, the Project manmgement did not consider necessary or
useful to resort to other consulting firms (management etc.).  The
consultants' participatiSn was therefore limited to the introduction of
up-to-date Information on techrology and equipment.
E.   Implemenntation Schceule
3.8       The entliaLed and actiual schedule of project implementatton In
shown In Annex 1. The commissioning of the first and second lines of
Sectton I of the Project was delaved 8 and 12 months to August and November
1980. respectively. while the commissioning of Section II was delayed 17
months to November 1979.  The net delay was 9 months due to difficulties in
obtaining offers from the main technology and equipment package for the
direct spinning of glass fiber from molten glass. The terms of delivery
obtained from the suppli.!rs were generallv longer than originallv projected
and erection of Section ; took I months longer than programmed.
3.nQ      Civil wnrks we-e comp'leted 24 months later than estimated at the
time of appraisal. This delay was due. in part, to (i) the need to
complete engineering design for main equipment. (ii) the need to redesign
the foundation for the firnace and (iII) the urgent tasks assigned to the
contractor (Bucharest Iniustrial Construction Trust) for the rebuilding of
the constructions damagei by the severe earthquake that hit Romania in



-5-
1977. Considering the Impact of the earthquake, the implementation
schedule is considered satisfactory.
F.   Procurement and Performance of Suppliers
3.10      Procurement took place under the general coordination of the
Enterprise with the responsibility for technical aspects, being assumed by
IPIU. Romuit was in charge of the procedures followed for imports and
*         Romanian equipment acquired through ICB.  For these Items, potential
suppliers were prequalified following procedures acceptable to the Bank
and taking Into account the technical capabilities and demonstrated
*         experience of Interested firms.  At least 2 or 3 foreign companies for each
package were prequalifled and in the case of 17 packages, wlth a total
value of about US$1.5 million, Romanlan suppliers were also prequalified.
3.11      Because of the difference between the Romanian and IBRD
procurement procedures, the Bank interpreted that its procurement
guidelines had not been fully complied with In the case of package No. 5
costing US$n.2 million and this amount of the Loan was cancelled. Four
packages supplied by Romanian firms could not be financed with the Loan
proceeds because of the higher price of imported packages (i.e. the
proceeds of the Rank loan had been exhausted). The final distribution of
disbursed funds from the Loan were 932 for imported equipment and 72 for
Romanian equlpment. Mnst of the value of imported packages was supplied by
the ItK (64.32), UISA (23.8A) and France (0.72). The balance (1.22) was
supplied by firms in Italy, Belgium, the Netherlands and the Federal
Republic of Germany.
3.12      During the period of procurement the borrower has observed the
IbRD methodology, namely procurement based on international bidding for the
equipment the values of which exceeded a certain price level (USS100,000)
stated in the Loan Agreement. Romsit stated that in certain cases
equipment could have been obtained at lower prices if direct shopping or
other forms of procurement had been followed instead of ICB. For the
beneftt of future projects, they therefore would want to increase the value
levels of procurement which according to the Loan Agreement could be
acquired through direct shopping.
C.   Enviromental Aspects
3.13      The Project has not encountered difficult problems concerning the
protection of the environment.  Gas emissions resulting from the production
of molten glass are subject to Romainian standards which are in line with
those required by the US and Western European countries. The limits for
fluorine and fluoride concentrations are respectively 9.2 and 2.n m.g. per
m3 of effluent gases and It is reported that the plant operates well within
these limits. Since total gas effluent volume is small the impact on the
enviroment is negligible.
3.1L      Liqtild indtistrial effluents are also subject to standards
regulated bv the Ministries of Industries and the Ministry of Health. To
complv with these standards, Project effluents are treated before being
discharged into the public sewage system. Solid waste materials amount to
about 2,5nn tons annuallv but do not present any pollution control problems

because they are practically inert materials. The plant installations are
provided with ventilation systems that maintain suspended materials
(including glass fibers) within the factory at an acceptable level. Noise
levels are comparable with other textile mills.
H.   Capital Costs, Disbursements and Financing Plan
3.15      The Project cost (i.e. excluding interest during construction)
amounted to US$35.5 million, 18.6% below the value estimated at the tine of
appraisal (Annex 2). This is mainly due to substantial reductions in the
cost of local equipment, import duties, erection, engineering and civil
works that compensated some overruns in preoperating, start-up and
training expenses, imported equipment and working capital.
3.16      Total financing required amounted to US$38.1 million, lower than
the 1977 estimate of US$45.7 million. The actual project costs in foreign
currency amounted to US$21.9 million, while those in local cuwrency Lei 682
million, which represent 97.8% and 50.3% respectively of the initial
estimates. Annex 2 draws a parallel between the figures initially
estimated in 1977 and those of the actual project costs broken down by
component items.
3.17      By their structure the actual costs were lower than the estimated
values. Unimportant overruns were recorded for training and commissioning
expenses as well as for working capital. The level of the expenses prior
to commissioning (including technical assistance charges for foreign
suppliers) is 3% higher than the estimated level, the balance being
explained by the extension of the test period, as compared with the
estimate. It should be mentioned that this excess would have been much
higher if the Romanian specialists had not taken part of the technical
assistance services initially foreseen to be supplied by foreign
suppliers. The increase of the working capital is mainly explained by the
price changes during the period of project implementation.
3.18      Initially, the closing date of the Bank loan was June 30, 1980.
As a result of the delays in Project implementation, the Bank agreed that
the closing date be extended six months until December 31, 1980, at which
date the remaining loan amount had been fully disbursed. The schedule of
loan disbursements is as follows:

Disbursements were reasonably close to the estimate.  Major
coutributing factors were that the project was relatively well defined and
Romanian preparation began well before the appraisal date.

IV. OPERATING PERFORMANCE
A.   Production
4.01      The actual and projected output of the Enterprise up to 1992, is
shown in Annex 3. The result is an increase both in yarn and roving
production and in fabrics and tubes output (tapes showing a marked
decrease). For 1985, it is planned to change part of the roving facilities
to manufacture yarn so that the production capacity of fabrics would be
correspondingly increased.
B.  Market Development
4.02      The comparison of supply and demand between appraisal estimates
and the current situation is shown in Annex 4, summarized below.
ROMANIA - Glass Fiber Production and Consumption

Consumption        1,345       7,100       3,634       11,440        9,417
Imports             829        1,600         560        4,440
Production          516        5,500       3,074        7,000        9,417
4.03      As compared to the appraisal report, actual 1980 demand showed:
- total consumption decreased by 49% (from 7,100 tons at the time
of appraisal, to 3,634 tons actual), 85Z of this demand being
supplied from domestic production (as against 77% foreseen in
the appraisal report) and 15% was imported (compared to
the appraisal estimate of 232).
- production decreased by 44% compared to the appraisal report
due to the delay in commissioning the Project.
- imports decreased to 560 tons as compared to the estimated
1,600 tons in the appraisal report, a drop of 65%. The
evolution of consumption is lower than projected at the time of
appraisal, the demand for finished products (fabrics, tubes and
tapes) being lower than the demand for glass fiber.
4.04      Comparing the forecasts for 1985 with the consideration of the
appraisal report shows:
- a decrease of 18% in total consumption (from 11,440 tons
estimated in the appraisal report to 9,417 tons) which would
be 100% supplied from domestic output (as against 61% foreseen
in the appraisal report), imports being eliminated (compared
to the appraisal estimate of 39%).



-8-
- consumption is fully covered by output.
The evolution of structure marks also changes in comparison
with the appraisal report, thus:
- yarn consumption is at the level estimated at the time of
appraisal (this being fully covered from domestic production)
and tubes and tapes consumption decrease by 62Z and 64Z
respectively as compared to appraisal report.
The Glass Fiber project did not have problems as far as placing
its production. The implementation of this project made it possible to
substitute imports.
4.05      The 1980 and 1981 consumption structure was the following:
Percentage
Estimated     Actual      Actual
1980         1980        1981
Building materials                 52            19         31
Chemical plants                    13             8          27
Electronic industry                35            73         42
Total                         100           100        100
In the field of building materials, the range of products for consumption
comprises: corrugated plates and skylights (for roof), sanitary objects,
bituminous slabs for water proofing, fireproof curtains; for electronic
industry cables and materials for electrical insulation, parts of machines
for the electrotechnical industry; and for chemical industry, pipes and
tanks. As compared with the consideration of the estimate, the rate
achieved in 1980 shows an obvious orientation towards the electrotechnical
industry, as a result of the policy of continuous modernization and export
promotion in this industry. In 1981, the product range structure became
more complex, depending on the glass fiber supply, by commissioning the
spinning mills.
V. FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE
A.   Production Costs
5.01      The actual specific consumption of raw materials at full capacity
(11,814.1 tons per year) is in general comparable to the appraisal estimate
of 11,551 tons per year. The unit consumption of raw materials for the
production of glass fiber was revised after appraisal in view of the
requirements indicated by the main technical know-how and equipment
supplier. A comparison with those considered in the appraisal report
follows:



9
Annual Consumption of Raw Materials
(at full capacity)
tons/year
Estimated     Actual        X
Quarts Sand                     4,908        5,058.7    103.0
Calcinated Alumina              1,214        1,370.9    112.9
Limestone                       1,578        1,915.8    121.4
Dolomite                        1,718        1,533.4     89.3
Boric Acid                      1,736        1,634.4     94.1
Calcium Fluoride                  395          240.1     66.9
Salt Cake                          32           60.8      1.9
Total                       11,551       11,814.1    102.3
Under steady operations it has been found that consumption of alumina and
limestone was higher than design and consumption of dolomite, boric acid
and calcium fluoride was lower. However these changes are typical in glass
fiber production since the raw material formulation is not an exact
science.
5.02      A review of the price structure of a number of products and
materials, including fuel prices, took place in 1981, in order to be in
line with international prices and to reflect the substantial increase of
fuel and energy prices. The new prices and those utilized for appraisal
are shown in Annex 5.
B.   Financial Analysis
5.03      Financial projections are shown in Annex 6.  They are based on
actual prices prevailing until 1981 and new prices now in force, applied to
the project's actual and projected volume of productien and costs,
5.04      The internal rate of return calculated on the basis of the above
is 24-1% (Annex 7), compared with 11% at the time of appraisal. The
increase in the financial return is due to the lower capital costs, the
increase in product prices and the shift towards higher value products.
These positive factors more than offset the negative impact of the Project
delay and the lower than expected buildup in production levels.
VI. ECONOMIC PERFORMANCE
6.01      For the purpose of calculating the economic costs and benefits of
the Project, the following ad,ustments are made on the financial data.
Eliminating import duties is the only adjustment in the economic capital
costs of the Project. The economic capital cost streams in current and
constant 1982 terms are shown in Annex 8. Production costs are adjusted as
shown in Annex 9. For natural gas, the economic price has been estimated
to be Lei 2,550/N m3 (or US$170/N m3), compared to the Romanian price of
Lei 5001N m3. For electric power, the economic price has been assumed to
be Lei 450/Mwh (or US$30.0 Mwh), compared to the Romanian price of Lei



- 10 -
370/Mwh. Boric acid, the only direct imported raw material, is priced
substantially equal to its import value, so its financial price is
unchanged. For other inputs, most of which are not internationally traded
to any significant degree, local prices have been increased by 10X, to
correct approximately for low energy prices in their respective production
costs. (At appraisal, no price adjustment was made for local materials to
arrive at economic prices.) The Romanian prices for glass fiber and glass
fiber products in 1982 are found to be generally in line with the
international prices 2/, except for roving, for which an econom&ic price of
Lei 30.0/kg (or US$2.0/kg) has been assumed, while the domestic price is
Lei 45.3/kg.
6.02      The economic rate of return calculated from the cost and benefit
streams in Annex 10 is 19.8%, compared with 16.5% at the time of
appraisal. The increased return is mainly due to: (i) capital costs are
lower than forecast despite the delays in Project implementation; (ii) the
increased production of high value items, as mentioned in para 3.03; and
(iii) the favorable international price developments for the glass fiber
products, which have increased the revenues at full capacity by about 50Z
while limiting the operating costs increases to about 41% in real terms.
6.03      At full capacity, net annual foreign exchange savings is
estimated to be about US$30 million 3/ in 1982 US dollars against the
appraisal estimate of US$12 million.  The large increase in net annual
foreign exchange savings is mainly due to about two-fold price increases
for the glass fiber products during 1976-82 period, and the shift towards
higher value products mentioned in para 3.03.
VII. BANK ROLE AND LESSONS LEARNED
A.   Bank Role
7.01      During the mid-1970s, the project formed part of a broad-based
effort on the part of the Bank to assist Romania in improving performance
of the industrial sector. Other projects selected include those in
fertilize-, steel, chemicals, fibers, and mechanical subsectors. This
Project was selected since it was import substitution for a key industrial
intermediate-glass fiber.
7.02      The Bank assisted in defining the technology package and
competitive bidding for that package reduced the cost substantially. The
same is true for equipment. The only alternative available--supplier's
credits--would have limited choice of equipment and repayment terms would
have been much shorter than for Bank funds.
2/   International prices for glass fiber are not readily available.
Several sources revealed present prices for several types of glass
fiber but it is probable that the present recessionary situation has
depressed price levels. These prices and prices for other products
set in line with them have been conservatively used for the economic
analysis.
3/   Natural gas is treated as a local cost in this calculation.



- 11 -
7.03      Overall, the Bank has helped the Romanian agencies develop a
better understanding of economic criteria in project evaluation. The Glass
Fiber Project is one example of this continuing process.
B.   Lessons Learned
7.04      While there were no new revelations concerning this project,
there were a number of observations that confirm lessons learned in
previous projects. Project implementation was reasonably successful
despite the one year delay. Early supervision is highly desirable to
complete all arrangements for engineering, technology and procurement
procedures. If a rapid follow-up after Board approval is not made, the
project sponsor can be left without sufficient guidance. In a situation
such as Romania's, where the country's procurement procedures are
different from the Bank's, frequent and early supervision can lead to
better understanding. This point has been confirmed in a number of
projects.

Dear Mr. Watanabe
Re : Project Completion Report on the Bucharest Glass
Fiber Enterprise(Loan 1447-RO)
We thank you for the remittance of the completion report for
the above mntioned project.
After careful analysis thereof we drew out the following
comments which we would kindly ask you to be taken into consideration
in the final document.:
1. On page iii, in the column "repaid" please, replace 3.8
Text      by 6.o ; in column "outstanding" please, replace 14.3 by 12.1,
amended
these being the repaid and outstanding amounts by the end of 1984.
Text           2. On page v, pera 2., please, replace "The Bank appraisal
amended   mission discussed with the Government..." by "The Bank appraisel
mission discussed with the representatives of the Light Industry
Ministry and of the Investment Bank..."
Text           3. On page 1, pars l.o2, please, replace "... a techno-economic
amended   study was prepared by the Central..." by "... a teohno-economio
study was prepared by the Central and IPIU...".
4. On page 1, pare l.o4 please, replace "... and full capacity
Text      operation is not expected until 1984..." by"...and full capacity
operation was reached in Octomber 1983... I.
Text           5. On page 1, pare 1.o3 please reword it partially, as follows
amended   "The Project was completed with an average delay of about one year.
The Project commissioning was gradual, some parts of the capacities
being commissioned with shorter delays(3,ooo tons roving, 21,8oo sq m

fabrics, 8,500 thous.m tapes and 3,300 thous. tons tubes).
The Project was completed at a lower coat than the appraisal
astimate".(follows the text of the report, par. 1.o3).
6. On page 4, para 3.o8 please replace 18 by 17 and "December"
amended   by "November", these being the correct data.
7. On page 2, para 2.o after the words "conventional part"
amended   please,add in brackets "building, technology for the weaving section,
utilities, etc".
8. On page 5, para 3.14 please, replace "Ministry of Industries"
amended   by "Ministries of Industries".
9. On page 4, para 3.o9 please, replace the words "... for the
amended   rebuilding of the industrial areas damaged..." by " ... for the
rebuilding of the constructions damaged"...
lo. On page 6, pars 3.17, line 9, please replace the words
amended   "to be granted" by "to be secured", in order to avoid the sense
"free of charge".
Text          11. On page  6, para 3.18 will be reworded as follows (last
amended  part, under the table):
Disbursements were rather close to the eatimate, major contri-
buting factors being That the project was well defined and Romanian
preparation began well before the appraisal date".
Text          12. On page  8, para 4.05, in the table, please, replace
amended  figure 18 from the second line with figure 8, comprised in the
completion report submitted by us.
Text amended   13. On page lo, para 7.o4, line 9, please delete the word
"fundamentally".Jlso, please, delete the last phrase of the para
7.o4, taking into account that :
- IBRD cancelled the amount of the loan on an unjustified
basis, without taking into account the borrower's arguments, who
participated in the ICB organized in accordance with World Bank
procurement procedures. ICE Uzinexport submitted a competitive bid,
more advantageous from the price viewpoint, as compared with
Dietze und Schell bid. The bid of the firm Uzinexport was, as
we informed by our telex of October 3-rd 1978, in comparable
prices, of t 149,147 as compared with Schell bid, of S 17o.911,
.1.

but the bidding award was temporized on basis of questionable
and unquantifiable reasons, in the meanwhile the validity period
of the bidebeing expired.
* Text        14. On page 11, para 7.o5, we propose the deletion of the
amended final part of the text, beginning with "ftile the procedure...",
because the loan funds were used primarily for the procurement
of imported itema(93%) and only 7% for local supply. Under these
circumstances the affirmation that the foreign supliers will be
more reluctant to participate in bidding is unfounded.
We look forward to receiving from you the final draft of the
report to be distributed to the Executive Directors.
Thanking you in advance, I remain
YoLrs faithfully,
Alexandru   eanu
