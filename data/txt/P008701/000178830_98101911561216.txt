APPRAISAL OF BUCHAREST GLASS FIBER PROJECT
SUMMARY AND CONCLUSIONS
i.        This report appraises the Bucharest Glass Fiber Project for which
the Government of Romania has requested a Bank loan of US$18.3 million. The
Project consists of two sections. Section I, the spinning plant, will pro-
duce 6,000 tons per year (tpy) of continuous glass fiber through the direct-
melt process in the form of roving and yarn (glass fiber intermediates),
and Section II will convert 1,270 tpy into woven roving, fabrics, tapes
and braided tubes. The remainder will be sold as roving and yarn. Sec-
tion I will employ sophisticated technology available only from a rather
closely held industry, while Section II will use conventional textile tech-
nology. The plant will be located in the industrial area "Militari", in
the south-western outskirts of Bucharest. It will be operated by a newly
established enterprise belonging to the Central for Glass and Fine Ceramics
under the Ministry of Light Industry. Total financing required for the Proj-
ect is estimated at Lei 914 million or US$45.7 million equivalent, includ-
ing US$24.5 million in foreign exchange.
ii.       None of the Project's glass fiber production is planned for direct
export since it will substitute imports and meet rapidly expanding domestic
demand which will result from the increasing usage of glass fiber by basic
industries provided for in the current Five-Year-Plan (1976-80). Romania
already has a small plant for 1,000 tpy of glass fiber which uses the simpler
but less efficient marbles process based on imported marbles. It began pro-
duction in 1974 and produced 516 tons in 1976 meeting 38% of demand in that
year. Demand started to grow rapidly in Romania in the early seventies from
only about 200 tons in 1970 to 1,345 tons in 1976. During the current Five-
Year-Plan consumption is expected to increase to about 7,100 tons in 1980.
This market projection does not yet take into account the effects of the re-
cent earthquake which, on balance, should lead to an increase in requirements
for glass fiber reinforced plastic needed to reconstruct Romania's severely
damaged chemical industry and general housing.
iii.      Glass fiber is used internationally for reinforcing plastics and
rubber in the construction, automotive and boat building industries and for
electric insulation, and to a lesser extent for fireproof fabrics. In con-
trast, in Romania glass fiber so far is used primarily for electric insula-
tion (33%) and in the chemical industry for reinforced plastic tanks and
pipes (62%), while the building materials industry uses only a small portion
(5%). The current implementation of downstream projects will substantially
change this structure and increase the consumption of glass fiber by the
building materials industry to 52% of total demand, reducing the market share
of the chemical industry correspondingly.
iv.       The projected increase will bring Romania's per capita glass fiber
consumption from 0.06 kg in 1976 to 0.32 kg in 1980, which corresponds to the
US per capita consumption of the late 1950's and the 1975 consumption of Spain,



- ii -
Italy and Austria. It will also bring the structure of Romania's glass
fiber consumption closer to that in more industrialized countries, but fur-
ther important potential applications of reinforced plastics remain, such
as applications in the boat building and automotive industry which are not
yet foreseen for Romania during the current Five-Year-Plan. After a steady
increase in world glass fiber consumption, a drop occurred in 1975, due to
the general recession in that year, but results for 1976, which are available
only for the USA, also the world's most important producer, indicate that
world consumption is increasing again, although it has not yet returned to
the peak level of 1973 and 1974. Therefore, there exists at present some
surplus capacity in the USA, Western Europe and Japan which is, however,
expected to be absorbed by increasing demand by 1978-79.
v.        The proposed Bank loan which would be for a term of 15 years, includ-
ing three years of grace, at an interest rate of 8.2% p.a., would be passed on
to the Project Enterprise by the Investment Bank, which controls the use of
investment funds in Romania and supervises the progress of projects. The
loan would provide 82% of the foreign exchange requirements (excluding
interest during construction) and would be disbursed against the supply of
know-how, machinery and equipment, erection supervision, training and start-
up assistance for the spinning plant (Section I). The Government will use
bilateral credits of US$4.1 million to meet part of the foreign exchange
expenditures for Section II, and will provide the remainder of the financing
required to cover US$21.2 million equivalent of local costs and interest
during construction.
vi.       Technically, the manufacture of glass fiber itself is part of the
glass industry, its further processing (into roving, yarn and woven products)
is part of the textile industry. In Romania, both these industries belong
to the Ministry of Light Industry which has given responsibility for the
Project to the Central for Glass and Fine Ceramics (CISCF). The Project was
originally planned for completion by mid-1978. However, due to the longer
than anticipated time needed for selecting the process and licensor for
Section I, this schedule can no longer be met, and Section I is now expected
to start production in mid-1979; Section II, on the other hand, is still
forecast to commence operations in mid-1978 as originally scheduled. Until
the commissioning of Section I, the weaving and finishing plant (Section II)
will use imported yarn and roving.
vii.      CISCF has established the Glass Fiber Yarn and Fabric Enterprise
to operate the plant, and has appointed an experienced Project manager. The
Ministry's Design Institute for Light Industry (IPIU), which also prepared
the technical-economic study for the Project, is responsible for engineering
(based on the information and designs provided by the foreign licensor and
suppliers). The time-critical contract for Section I was awarded as a turn-
key, lump-sum contract after international-competitive bidding and was signed
in April 1977. The required down-payment of US$1.4 million is proposed to be
financed retroactively by the Bank.
viii.      Practically all raw materials (sand, boric acid, dolomite, lime-
stone and calcined alumina) will come from domestic sources, and utilities
will be supplied from existing facilities in the industrial area selected
for the Project. The Project poses no difficult environmental problems.



- iii -
ix.       In Romania all prices are fixed by the State Committee for Prices.
The primary responsibility of an enterprise is to meet established physical
targets, and inputs and outputs are calculated at the fixed prices. There
is a historical tendency for prices not to be changed over long periods of
time. The product prices for the Project have been approved by the State
Committee on the basis of projected production costs plus a margin of 10%
of production costs for profit. Although financial viability is not of pri-
mary importance to Romania because of the centralized nature of its economy,
achievement of profitability targets as established for each enterprise on
the basis of fixed prices is a measure of the efficiency of an enterprise's
management. The financial projections for the Enterprise provide for losses
during the first two years of operation, and the profit break-even point (61%
of capacity utilization) is expected to be exceeded during the third year of
operation (1980). The Project's financial rate of return is 11%.
x.        The Project faces few risks.  It has been well prepared, and the
licensor/supplier for Section I guarantees the quantitative and qualitative
output of the plant. However, due to the tight implementation schedule, the
possibility of a minor delay exists. Furthermore, glass fiber production
requires skilled operators. There is already some experience available from
the small existing plant but, in addition, provision for operator training
by the licensor/supplier has been made.
xi.       The economic cost of production of the Project is comparable to
that of a similar plant in Western Europe that was recently completed. This
is so because practically all raw materials come from Romanian sources, and
the lower Romanian labor costs offset the slightly higher cost of investment
and of maintenance materials. Both plants would need a price level of about
US$2 per kg of roving and yarn in order to yield a satisfactory return, and
this is also about the current price level for the same intermediates in the
USA, Western Europe and Japan. Using this price level, the Project yields
an economic rate of return of 16.5% in real terms. The Project will employ
about 1,200 persons, representing an investment of about US$38,000 per per-
son. At full capacity, the Project will yield net annual foreign exchange
savings (before amortization of the Bank loan) of about US$12 million.
xii.      Based on the agreements reached on the points listed in Chapter VIII
of this report, the Project is suitable for a Bank loan of US$18.3 million
equivalent for a period of 15 years, including three years of grace, at an
interest rate of 8.2%.






I. INTRODUCTION
1.01      The Government of Romania has requested a Bank loan of US$18.3 mil-
lion equivalent for the construction of a plant in the outskirts of Bucharest
to produce 6,000 tons per year (tpy) of continuous glass fiber, in the form
of roving, yarn, woven roving and yarn fabrics, tapes and braided tubes. 1/
Total financing required for the Project is estimated at Lei 914 million
(US$45.7 million), including Lei 490 million (US$24.5 million) in foreign
exchange. The Government will provide the remainder of the financing, using
bilateral credits to cover part of the remaining foreign exchange require-
ments. The Project was approved and funds allocated by a decision of the
Council of Ministers. Implementation of the Project has begun, and production
is scheduled to begin in mid-1978 for one section and mid-1979 for another.
1.02      The Project is part of the Government's strategy to promote rapid
industrialization and to introduce new and advanced technologies. Domestic
demand for glass fiber is projected to grow rapidly during the current
Five-Year-Plan period (1976-80), and the Project will substitute imports.
Continuous glass fibers are used mainly for reinforcing plastics and rubber
and for electrical insulation, and to a lesser extent for fireproof curtains
and upholstery. None of the Project's glass fiber production is planned
for direct export but some may be exported as part of reinforced plastic or
electrical goods.
1.03      The Project was first reviewed by a Bank identification mission to
Romania in April 1976, which from a list of eight industrial projects gave
this Project together with two others priority for Bank support. The Project
was subsequently appraised in November 1976 by a mission consisting of
Messrs. G. Becher (Chief) and Eus T. Tortorelli of the Industrial Projects
Department and M. Greco (consultant). The appraisal is based on the technical-
economic study prepared by the Romanian Design Institute for Light Industry
(IPIU).
II. THE SECTOR AND THE BORROWER
A.   Ministry of Light Industry
2.01      Technically, the manufacture of glass fiber is part of the glass
industry, its processing into roving, yarn and woven products is part of the
textile industry. In Romania, both these industries belong to the Ministry
of Light Industry, and this Ministry has, therefore, been assigned the task
of implementing the Project. The Ministry has, in turn, given this responsi-
bility to its Industrial Central for Glass and Fine Ceramics (CISCF), which
has established the Glass Fiber Yarn and Fabric Enterprise (the Enterprise)
to implement and operate the plant. The organizational structure of the
light industry has the same three step hierarchy as all industrial sectors
in Romania, consisting of the technical ministry at the top, the industrial
1/   A glossary of the main technical terms used in this report is given in
Annex 1.



2
central in the middle, and the enterprise at the bottom. The ministry is
responsible for the planning and performance of its sector for which it also
approves investments for subsequent submission to the Council of Ministers,
the highest authority for final approval. A list of the eight centrals under
the Ministry of Light Industry is given in Annex 2-1.  The industrial central
directs the operations of all enterprises in its particular sub-branch of
the economy (e. g. Central for Cotton Products, Central for Glass and Fine
Ceramics), allocates production programs and coordinates purchase of raw mate-
rials and domestic sales. The Ministry of Light Industry also has under its
control the Design Institute for Light Industry (IPIU), which is responsible
for the preparation of feasibility studies, 1/ and the general and detailed
design, as well as construction and erection supervision of projects carried
out by the centrals under the Ministry. The Ministry further has two foreign
trade enterprises: ROMSIT which is responsible for the import of know-how
and machinery and equipment, and ROMANOEXPORT, in charge of the export (and
import) of light industry products. IPIU has prepared the feasibility study
for the Project and is preparing the general and detailed designs, and
ROMSIT, with the advice of IPIU, is responsible for the procurement of
imported goods for the Project.
B.   Industrial Central for Glass and Fine Ceramics
2.02      The Central for Glass and Fine Ceramics (CISCF) is responsible
for the planning and production of glass products, chinaware and pottery.
It employs about 40,000 people in its 26 enterprises. Its seat is Bucharest.
Romania has a well established glass and ceramics industry. Its growth
rate since 1950 has averaged 13% p.a., very close to the average rate for
the entire industrial sector of 12.9%. In 1975 it produced 358,000 tons
of glassware. About 20% of its production is exported. CISCF also has
an institute responsible for all research in the glass industry. A more
detailed description of CISCF, including summarized financial statements,
is presented in Annex 2-2.
2.03      One of the enterprises under CISCF is a small plant for continuous
glass fiber with a design capacity of 1,000 tpy (300 tpy of roving and 700
tpy of mat). The plant was designed by the Design Institute of the Ministry
for Building Materials with assistance from an Italian engineering firm. It
is based on the so-called marbles process (para. 4.02) and uses imported glass
marbles for conversion into fibers. Most of the equipment is manufactured in
Romania. The plant started production in 1974 with 76 tons, increasing to
436 tons in 1975 and 516 tons in 1976. It is to reach full capacity in 1977.
The plant employs 110 people and is located right next to the site for the
Project. Although its technology is much simpler, it will be very useful for
training some of the operators for the Project.
C.   Romanian Financing System and the Investment Bank (the Borrower)
2.04      Investments are financed fully with non-interest-bearing capital.
The central aggregates the funds available from cash generation of its
1/   In Romania called "technical-economic study" and required prior to
approval of an investment by the Council of Ministers.



- 3 -
enterprises and matches them against funds required for approved investments.
Any surplus is transferred to the state budget, and any deficit is covered
from the state budget. After start of operation of a new plant, the funds are
returned to the State (via the central) in the form of payments by the enter-
prise into several different funds (para. 6.13). All prices are fixed by the
State Committee for Prices. The primary responsibility of an enterprise is to
meet established physical targets, and inputs and outputs are calculated at
the fixed prices. Financial profitability for an enterprise as related to
capital employed and output is established by the central and the achievement
of the specific profitability targets is a measure of the efficiency of an
enterprise's management. There is a historical tendency for prices not to be
changed over long periods of time. This implies not only that there is a lack
of correlation with shifting supply and demand relations but, also, that
cost/price relationships become distorted as the industry expands, new
technology is introduced and labor productivity increases. To remedy these
distortions periodic price resetting is undertaken for the whole economy, at
which each sector is reviewed separately. The last such price resetting was
in 1974-76 and the currently prevailing internal prices are expected to be in
force at least through the end of the Five-Year-Plan period (1980).
2.05      The Investment Bank (IB) controls the use of all investment funds.1/
The president of IB reports to the Minister of Finance. During project
preparation, IB reviews the technical-economic study prepared by the respon-
sible design institute, before its submission to the Council of Ministers for
final approval. During implementation, IB supervises the progress of the proj-
ect and the use of funds. Therefore, as has been the case for all previous
industrial projects financed by the Bank, IB is proposed to be the Borrower of
the Bank loan. It will be responsible for supervising on the Romanian side
the execution of the Project and the procurement of goods and services required
for it; assurances in this regard have been obtained.
III. THE MARKET
A.   Uses of Glass Fibers
3.01      Continuous glass fibers are used for purposes of reinforcement,
insulation and fireproofing (para. 3.02). The fibers are not necessarily long
or continuous when used in such applications but, when first manufactured, are
drawn as continuous filaments from molten glass. This differentiates them
from discontinuous fibers commonly referred to as glass wool which is used for
heat and sound insulation. 2/ The fibers to be produced by the Project will
be of "E" (electrical) glass, the normal type of glass used in continuous
fiber production. As it is almost alkali-free, "E" glass has a high elec-
trical resistance and is, therefore, ideal for electrical insulation. 3/
1/   Except those allocated to agriculture and food processing which are
controlled by the Agricultural Bank.
2/   Romania has glass wool production facilities for about 500 tpy.
3/   Other glass types are "A" glass (alkali-containing), "C" glass (chemically
resistant) and "S" glass (high strength).



- 4 -
3.02      More than 85% of glass fiber currently produced in the world is
used as reinforcement for plastic materials to improve their mechanical
properties. The product obtained from the combination of polymers and glass
fibers is called "Glass Reinforced Plastic" (GRP). In addition to their use
in GRP, glass fibers have the following applications:
(i) reinforcement of rubber materials such as conveyor
belts and special tires. Glass fibers are used here
as a multiplicity of twisted yarns or "cord";
(ii) insultation of electric wires and cables and other
high voltage items;
(iii) reinforcement of paper. Yarn is inserted in the paper
to impart extremely high unidirectional strength. Main
end uses are special bags and tapes; and
(iv) manufacture of fabrics for fireproof curtains, industrial
filters, upholstery and for the production of bituminous
sheets for water proofing of buildings.
The main products marketed by the glass fiber producers are roving (used
as such or woven), chopped and milled fibers (as such or as a mat or veil),
yarn and yarn woven into fabrics and tapes or braided into tubes. A general
description of these glass fiber products as well as their end uses and
average content in GRP is given in Annex 3-1.
3.03      Since the largest share of glass fiber is used in GRP, the develop-
ment trend for these products is of primary importance for future glass fiber
consumption. As the table below indicates, consumption of GRP in the different
end-use sectors varies in the main markets. Market sophistication and level
of industrial development are important factors as the consumption of GRP
shifts from building materials and electrical appliances in less developed
markets to automotive and boat building in the more advanced ones.

B.   World Market
3.04      The following brief discussion of the world market for glass fiber
serves as background information only, since the Project will use largely
local materials and produce only for the domestic market. Manufacturing of
glass fiber is a very sophisticated technology, and only few companies in
the world have developed original processes in this field. The secrecy and
exclusiveness of this industry is such that these companies are in a posi-
tion to control the international market, either through participation or
licensing agreements with most producers. 1/ In part on account of the
oligopolistic structure of the industry, reliable capacity, production and
consumption statistics are difficult to obtain, and there appears to be a
tendency to overstate production capacity and understate capacity utiliza-
tion. About 85-90% of all glass fiber used in the world are produced and
consumed in the USA, Western Europe and Japan. Some minor production capac-
ity exists in Canada, Eastern Europe and Latin America. World consumption
in 1973, production capacity, actual production and consumption in 1975, and
projected demand for 1980 are summarized below, and discussed in more detail
in Annex 3-2.

a/   Estimated
World production capacity in 1975 was estimated at 780,000 tpy, led by the USA
with 390,000 tpy (50%), followed by Western Europe with 222,000 tpy (29%),
Japan with 120,000 tpy (15%) and the remaining producing countries with 48,000
tpy (6%). Estimated total world production increased steadily from about
400,000 tons in 1970 to 610,000 tons in 1974 (Annex 3-2, Table 4), but fell
1/   Annex 3-2 (Table 1) shows that the six most important licensors control
83% of the capacity in the three main markets (USA, Western Europe,
Japan), and the three most important ones control 68%.



off sharply in 1975 to an estimated level of 483,000 tons, indicating a level
of capacity utilization of only about 60%, which was caused by the general
recession in that year. Average capacity utilization in the USA, which was
also only about 60% in 1975, has improved to 73% during 1976 (Annex 3-2, Table
6), and is expected to return to the pre-recession level of 85-90% in 1978-79.
3.05      The projected glass fiber demand in the three main consuming areas
in 1980 is based on an analysis of the GRP market by end-use sectors and their
expected development trends. Glass fiber consumption in the USA, Western
Europe and Japan is expected to grow from about 523,000 tons in 1973 to about
800,000 tons in 1980, representing an annual growth rate of 6.25%. Japan is
forecast to show the highest growth rate (11% p.a.) and to more than double
its level of consumption, from 67,000 tons in 1973 to about 140,000 tons in
1980. Western Europe is expected to have a growth rate of 8% , and the USA one
of 4% p.a. Average per capita consumption in 1975 in the USA was 1.0 kg, in
Japan 0.4 kg and in Western Europe about 0.5 kg, ranging from 0.3 kg in Italy,
Spain and Austria to 0.7 kg in Germany and Netherlands. On the basis of the
projected increase, 1980 per capita consumption in the USA would reach 1.4 kg,
Japan 1.1 kg and Europe 0.8 kg. The production capacity in the USA, Western
Europe and Japan in 1977 is indicated by the industry at 820,000 tons (Annex
3-2, Table 4), and the total world production capacity is indicated at 875 to
900,000 tons. A consumption level of 800,000 tons in 1980 in USA, Western
Europe and Japan would nearly fully utilize their indicated 1977 capacity.
No demand projections for countries outside the USA, Western Europe and Japan
are available, but total consumption in these countries is unlikely to exceed
150,000 tons in 1980. This implies that additional capacity of 50 to 75,000
tpy must be built between 1977 and 1980 to meet projected world demand in 1980.
C.   World Market Prices
3.06      Prices of glass fiber products differ in the three largest markets,
USA, Western Europe and Japan. Lowest prices are found in the USA, while in
Japan and especially in Western Europe quotations for the same articles are
normally higher. The explanation is found in the lower cost of raw materials
and, in particular, natural gas in the USA. 1/ Romania is currently importing
glass fiber from Japan, France, Belgium, Sweden and Czechoslovakia (CSSR).
The table below compares current (1976) domestic prices in the USA, Japan and
Western Europe with current import prices of Romania. On an average, Romanian
import prices in 1976 were somewhat below domestic prices in the three main
markets. However, as increasing demand absorbs the existing surplus capacity,
import prices are expected to gradually return to the level of domestic
prices. In the past, domestic prices for glass fiber have steadily risen to
reflect increasing raw material, labor and energy costs, even in times of
reduced capacity utilization such as 1975 (Annex 3-2). The high level of
concentration in the industry most likely accounts for this resistance of
prices against downward pressure.
1/   During the recent gas curtailments, some manufacturers in the USA had
to shut down their plants or operate at reduced levels of capacity uti-
lization. Other plants which were able to switch to alternative fuels,
such as propane, raised their prices by a special energy surcharge of
about US50 per kg.

D.   The Romanian Market
3.07      Romanian glass fiber consumption began in the late sixties and
developed at a very rapid rate (50% p.a. on an average). Local production
started in 1974 with the small plant near Bucharest (para. 2.03) for roving
and mat and reached about 516 tons in 1976, providing about 38% of the coun-
try's glass fiber consumption in that year. Romania's production, import and
consumption of glass fiber is shown below for 1971 and 1976. A more detailed
discussion of the Romanian glass fiber market is given in Annex 3-3.

3.08      Until now, electrical insulation and reinforcement of plastic tanks
and pipes for the chemical industry have been the main applications of glass
fiber in Romania. Within the current Five-Year-Plan (1976-80), the production
capacity of some major users of glass fiber will be expanded considerably,
particularly in the field of building materials. The current structure of
consumption by end-use sector and the anticipated change are shown below:

-8-
A comparison with the structure of consumption by end-use sector in the
markets of Western Europe, USA and Japan shows that in those markets the
sectors of building materials, chemical plants and electrical applications
constitute only slightly more than one-half of the entire glass fiber con-
sumption. Other important end-use sectors are the automotive and other
transport industry and the boat building industry. The latter alone uses
about one quarter of the glass fiber consumed in the USA. However, these
applications are not yet being considered in Romania.
3.09      The projected consumption, production and import of glass fiber in
Romania for the years 1978, 1980 and 1985 are shown below (for detail see
Annex 3-3). The figures for 1980 are based on the targets of the current
Five-Year-Plan, but modified to take into account the actual status of imple-
mentation of projects consuming glass fiber. This projection was prepared in
November 1976 and does not yet take into account the effects of the recent
earthquake on the economy and the market for glass fiber. However, on balance,
this should lead to an increase in glass fiber requirements since large
quantities of glass reinforced plastic will be needed to reconstruct Romania's
severely damaged chemical industry and general housing. Growth of consumption
after 1980 has been projected at 10% p.a. which is a conservative growth rate
if compared with the actual rate between 1971 and 1976 OiL7% p.a.) and the
planned growth rate for the current Five-Year-Plan (35% p.a.).

3.10      Consumption of glass fiber in Romania is expected to increase
from 1,345 tons in 1976 to about 7,100 tons in 1980 and 11,440 tons in 1985.
Per capita consumption which was only 0.06 kg in 1976 would increase to 0.32
kg in 1980, which corresponds to the US per capita consumption of the late
1950's and the 1975 per capita consumption of Spain, Italy and Austria. On
the basis of the projected consumption of glass fiber, Romania would continue
to import glass fiber, reaching a peak of 4,767 tons in 1978. Imports would
still be 967 tons in 1981 when the Project is expected to reach full production.
E.   Marketing Arrangements
3.11      As mentioned above, the entire production of the Project is planned
for domestic consumption, substituting imports. The Central for Glass and
Fine Ceramics, under whose authority the plant will operate, will deliver the
plant output to other centrals, who are the end-users of glass fibers. The
respective ministries after consultation on the needs of their enterprises
signed a protocol on the long-term quantities of glass fiber to be supplied by
the Project. After Project start-up detailed annual sales plans will be
prepared and actual sales contracts signed with the glass fiber consuming
enterprises. The Enterprise is expected to have about 10 such contracts.
IV. THE PROJECT
A.   Project Scope
4.01      The Project consists of a spinning plant (Section I) with a capacity
of 6,000 tpy of glass fiber in the form of roving and yarn and of a weaving
and finishing plant (Section II) with a capacity of 6 million m2 of fabrics,
10 million linear meter of tapes, and 3.3 million lin. m of braided tubes.
Section II will use 1,270 tpy of yarn and roving from Section I, the balance
(4,730 tpy) will be sold as roving and yarn. The plant will be located in
Militari, an industrial area in the outskirts of Bucharest, southwest of the
city. The area is being developed as a major industrial estate and provides
common facilities for power generation, steam, water and natural gas supply.
A detailed description of the proposed production process and plant facilities
is given in Annex 4-1.
B.   Process Technology
4.02      The manufacture of glass fiber consists of three stages:  (1) the
manufacture of glass, (2) the drawing of continuous filaments, i.e. the conver-
sion of molten glass into strands, and (3) the conversion of glass fibers
into saleable products. At one time, these three stages constituted separate
manufacturing activities. Glass was first produced in the form of marbles
(marbles process), and the marbles were re-melted for conversion into fibers.
Romania's first small plant uses this process. Some 15 years ago, the
"direct-melt" process was introduced which converts the molten glass directly
into fibers. The Project will use the direct-melt method which is more
energy efficient, and has lower platinum/rhodium requirements and lower



- 10 -
material losses. 1/ Only a limited number of companies in the world have
developed processes for this specialized technology. The licensor will
supply know-how, engineering, equipment, start-up assistance and training for
Section I and will guarantee the performance of this plant portion. Section
I will have two furnaces with a capacity of 3,000 tpy of glass fiber each.
The furnaces have an expected life of 3 to 4 years, after which they are
relined with new refractories. Having two furnaces permits relining of one
furnace while the other is in operation.
4.03      The weaving and finishing plant (Section II) will utilize conven-
tional technology similar to that for other fibers in the textile industry.
Although glass fiber has special handling characteristics and requires special
finishing technology, there are a number of suppliers who have the necessary
know-how and manufacture equipment to the required specifications. The
foreign suppliers will train Romanian operators and assist during start-up and
commissioning, and provide a performance guarantee for their respective
equipment. A graphic presentation of the production steps in Section I
and II is shown in Annex 4-2 and a plant layout in Annex 4-3.
C.   Raw Materials and Utilities
4.04      The principal raw materials are quartz sand, limestone, calcined
alumina, dolomite and boric acid. Except for a small quantity of calcium
fluoride which will be imported, all raw materials are produced locally.
Quartz sand is the most critical raw material since its purity and constancy
of composition is an essential requirement of the direct-melt process. The
Miorcani quarries in north-east Romania can supply a suitable grade of quartz
sand in sufficient quantities. Raw material requirements, sources and means
of transport are listed in Annex 4-4. Location of domestic raw material
sources are shown in Map IBRD 12652R1. The central position of Bucharest,
where the plant will be located, in the Romanian highway and railroad systems
will keep the transportation costs for raw materials and finished products at
a minimum.
4.05      Utility requirements will be met from external sources.  Power
will be supplied from the existing network, steam from the boiler house of
a nearby synthetic leather factory and natural gas from the 28" pipeline
which supplies gas to the Bucharest area from the Transylvania gasfields.
These arrangements are satisfactory and no bottlenecks are expected to develop
over the life of the Project.
D.   Management and Project Execution
4.06      As noted above, the Central for Glass and Fine Ceramics (CISCF) has
already established the Enterprise to implement and operate the plant. CISCF
and the Enterprise have primary responsibility for project implementation.
They also have direct responsibility for the procurement of local equipment
and raw materials and the recruitment and training of operating personnel.
1/   The unit production costs of Romania's small plant are about 40% above
those of the Project.



- 11 -
CISCF is well experienced in the implementation of new projects. It has
delegated several areas of project execution to the following organizations
which are well versed in their respective tasks and judged to be capable of
handling them effectively:
-    IPIU, the engineering enterprise of the Ministry of Light
Industry is responsible for the design of the entire plant
(based on the information and designs provided by the
licensor and suppliers);
-    ROMSIT, the foreign trade enterprise of the Ministry of
Light Industry is responsible for the procurement of
imported goods;
-    The Trust for Industrial Buildings is responsible for the
execution of civil works and equipment erection.
4.07      CISFC has appointed a manager for the Enterprise.  He is in the
process of forming a team to coordinate and supervise project implementa-
tion, and the same team will constitute the management of the Enterprise at
the start of operation. An organization chart of the Enterprise is given
in Annex 4-5. The appointed manager is an engineer with broad experience
in the field of glass making factories, at both the design and construction
stage as well as in production management, and is well qualified for the job.
IPIU and ROMSIT have appointed senior members of their staff to the Project.
The arrangements for project implementation are satisfactory.
4.08      According to the current Five-Year-Plan, the Project was scheduled
for completion by mid-1978. However, due to the longer than anticipated time
needed for selecting the process and licensor for Section I, this schedule
can no longer be met, and Section I is now expected to start production in
mid-1979; Section II, on the other hand, is still forecast to commence
operations in mid-1978 as originally planned. Until the start of production
of Section I, the weaving and finishing plant (Section II) will use imported
yarn and roving. One furnace of Section I is to be lit up in April 1979 and
the second in July 1979. The formal acceptance test for Section I is expected
at the latest for January 1980. The phased commissioning of the two sections
will allow a quick build-up of capacity utilization for the more capital-
intensive Section I. A project implementation schedule is shown in Annex 4-6.
As part of the information to be provided (para. 6.15), the Enterprise will
submit by September 30, 1977, a critical path schedule for the implementation
of the Project.
E.   Employment and Training
4.09      A total staff of about 1,200 (about 60% female staff), is expected
to operate the plant including about 15% maintenance personnel needed for the
sophisticated machinery. Training of operators for Section I will be carried
out through:
(i)  specialized plant training at the licensor's processing
units abroad;



- 12 -
(ii) on-the-job training for mechanics, welders and operators
by the licensor's supervisory staff present in Romania for
plant erection and commissioning; and
(iii) operator training in the existing small glass fiber plant.
For Section II, training will be carried out in existing textile facilities
in Romania and, if judged necessary, by machinery suppliers abroad. A total
of about 820 staff will benefit from the training program, estimated to cost
US$400,000 equivalent. An outline of the training program, as currently
contemplated, is given in Annex 4-7. Assurances have been obtained that the
Enterprise will submit by December 31, 1977, a detailed training program that
is acceptable to the Bank.
F.   Ecology
4.10      The Project does not pose any difficult environmental problems.
Fluorine and fluoride emissions which result from the reaction taking place
during glass melting, are subject to Romanian standards (average fluorine
and fluorides concentrations of 0.2 and 2.0 mg/m3 respectively), which are
in line with standards in Western Europe and the USA. The Project will be
designed to meet these standards. The discharge of industrial effluents in
Romania is regulated by standards issued jointly by the Ministries of Industry
and Public Health. Liquid effluents from the plant will be treated in a waste
water treatment unit prior to discharge into the sewer system.  The Project
will produce about 2,500 tpy of waste glass fibers, which also do not pose
difficult pollution problems as they are substantially inert. All equipment
will be fitted with labor safety devices, and air conditioning will keep the
concentration of noxious elements (including fiber) below maximum admissible
limits. The proposed pollution control facilities, as envisaged under the
Project, are considered adequate, and assurances were obtained that the
Enterprise will operate these pollution control facilities with due regard to
ecological, environmental and safety factors. A more detailed discussion of
the environmental impact and protection is presented in Annex 4-8.
V. CAPITAL COST AND FINANCING PLAN
A.   Project Cost
5.01      Total financing required for the Project (Sections I and II) is
estimated at US$45.7 million equivalent, including US$24.5 million in foreign
exchange. Details of capital cost estimates are given in Annex 5-1 and
summarized below:

a/   c.i.f. cost at plant site.
5.02      The capital cost estimate is based on the main fixed-price contract
for Section I which is scheduled to be signed before the end of April 1977, on
three contracts signed with suppliers for Section II and on recent quotations
obtained for the remaining contracts to be signed. Local costs have been esti-
mated by IPIU on the basis of the expected volume of civil works and erection.
Foreign exchange requirements excluding interest during construction for
Section I are US$18.0 million and for Section II US$4.4 million. Import
duties on equipment average 33%. A physical contingency of 5% of the base
cost estimate has been added which is sufficient due to the advanced state of
the Project. For foreign supplied goods and services, although supplied on
the basis of fixed-price contracts, annual price increases of 7.5% have been



- 14 -
assumed in order to establish project cost in April 1977 prices. Local costs
are forecast to increase 1% annually throughout the project implementation.
The above cost estimates, including physical and price contingencies, are
considered adequate.
5.03      In Romania, all financial flows in and out of industrial enterprises
are recorded in accounts held by one single bank (National Bank) and payment
terms are legally fixed at low levels. Romanian enterprises, therefore,
can keep relatively small working capital, largely in the form of inven-
tory. Net working capital required for the Project is estimated at Lei 24
million (US$1.2 million). A detailed estimate is given in Annex 5-2.
B.  Financing Plan
5.04      The Project is part of CISCF's current Five-Year-Plan.  In establish-
ing its investment and financing plan, the Central aggregates all approved
investments of its enterprises and matches them against the availability of
funds from its enterprises through cash generation. If the total investment
requirements exceed the combined availability of funds, then the Central
obtains a budget allocation. There is, therefore, no specific financing plan
for this one Project alone. During the current Plan period (1976-80), the
structure of CISCF's financing plan for its investments is as follows:
Structure of CISCF's Financing Plan
During 1976-80 Plan Period
Source of Funds                     %
Depreciation                      69.2
Benefit (= profit)                24.9
Budget                             5.9
100.0
5.05      The funds for the Project will be provided to the Enterprise through
the Central and will be returned by the Enterprise to the State in the form of
contributions to different funds (para. 6.13). Although the IBRD loan will be
used for Section I and bilateral credits for the importation of machinery and
equipment for Section II, these funds will not be on-lent to the Central or
Enterprise. In this respect, the Investment Bank will work like a "central
bank", making available the necessary foreign exchange to the Central and
Enterprise against local currency provided in accordance with CISCF's financ-
ing plan. Interest during construction which does not exist under the Romanian
system but will accrue on the IBRD loan and the bilateral credits will be born
by the Investment Bank and not charged to the Central or Enterprise.

5.06      The proposed Bank loan of US$18.3 million will be made to the
Investment Bank for a period of 15 years, including 3 years of grace, at an
interest rate of 8.2% p.a. The schedule of principal and interest payments
on the Bank loan is shown in Annex 5-3.
5.07      The Council of Ministers' approval of the Project includes approval
to spend funds up to the estimated cost of the Project (including foreign
exchange). The organizations responsible for project implementation consider
this amount as a strict limit that is not to be exceeded, since a new decision
by the Council of Ministers would be required. The Council's decision for
the Project has established the limit of Lei 850 million for the Project's
total cost (excluding working capital and interest during construction) and
US$24.5 million (excluding working capital, interest during construction and
also indirect foreign exchange requirements) as the limit for the Project's
foreign-exchange expenditures. Both limits exceed the latest estimate used
in this report of Lei 848 million and US$20.9 million respectively. Moreover,
the standard assurances were obtained that the Government will make available
the funds needed for the execution of the Project. The Project will be
considered as completed when the facilities during a period of 10 consecutive
days, achieve design capacity production.

C.   Procurement
5.08      Procurement procedures for Bank financed goods and services are in
accordance with Bank guidelines. As for the main contract for Section I all
known suppliers of technology and equipment were contacted directly by ROMSIT
but in addition, at the Bank's request, a letter was sent to all embassies of
Bank member countries represented in Romania. Detailed technical discussions
were held during 1976 with the four qualified suppliers who had expressed
interest to participate in the bidding. Subsequently, they were invited to
submit a final tender price in December 1976, based on the detailed technical
documentation agreed upon during technical discussions. Only two of the four
companies submitted valid bids. They were evaluated by ROMSIT and IPIU, and
the evaluation was subsequently reviewed and the recommended award accepted
by the Bank. The contract between ROMSIT and the selected bidder, a British
engineering firm representing TBA-Bishop technology, 1/ is scheduled to be
signed before the end of April 1977. It calls for the supply on a turn-key
basis of the know-how, engineering, equipment, erection supervision, training
and start-up assistance for Section I. The related contracts for twisting
equipment and bushings for which the suppliers were specified by the main
contractor and whose offers were evaluated together with the main contract,
are expected to be signed in May 1977. Additional machinery and equipment for
Section I not forming part of the main contract will be submitted to interna-
tional competitive bidding (or international shopping for items below
US$100,000 equivalent) in an amount of US$1.5 million. For this equipment,
Romanian suppliers will be qualified to participate in the bidding, and the
normal 15% preference will be applied to Romanian bids. Imported equipment
for Section II, which will be financed from bilateral credits, will be pur-
chased in accordance with Romanian procurement procedures. There will be
about six contracts for Section II, three of which had been signed as of April
1977, with the remainder expected to be signed by the end of May 1977.
D.   Allocation and Disbursement of Bank Loan
5.09      The Bank loan will cover 40% of the total financing required for
the Project, and about 75% of the estimated foreign exchange requirement. It
will be disbursed against 100% of the foreign expenditures under the contract
for the supply of know-how, engineering, machinery and equipment, erection
supervision, training and start-up assistance for Section I and the related
contracts for twisting equipment and bushings. It is expected that down-pay-
ments of US$1.4 million will have been made on these contracts before the
Bank loan is signed. It is, therefore, proposed to finance retroactively
expenditures made after April 15, 1977, not expected to exceed US$1.4 million.
In addition the Bank loan will be disbursed against 100% of foreign expendi-
tures or local ex-factory cost of contracts won after international competi-
tive bidding or international shopping for other, ancillary machinery and
equipment for Section I, as summarized below:
1/   See Annex 3-2, Table 1 for main licensors.

VI. FINANCIAL ANALYSIS
A.   Volume and Value of Production
1.   Volume of Production
6.01      The weaving and finishing plant (Section II) is expected to start
production in July 1978 and reach 50% capacity utilization during the re-
mainder of that year, 95% in 1979 and 100% in 1980. The spinning plant
(Section I) is expected to start production in mid-1979, reaching 30% average
capacity utilization in that year, 75% in 1980 and 100% in 1981. 1/ Although
the Project incorporates technology that is new for Romania and requires
skilled operators, the projected buildup of capacity utilization is considered
realistic in light of the training and start-up assistance provided by the
foreign suppliers. Also, since the design capacities of Sections I and II
have been established with due allowance for downtime 2/, achievement of 100%
of design capacity utilization can realistically be expected.
6.02      Since production of Section I will start about one year after the
start-up of Section II, roving and yarn will have to be imported in 1978 and
yarn in 1979. There will be no difficulty in importing the required quanti-
ties. The production volume and import requirements of yarn and roving in
the first four years of operation are projected as follows:
1/   Detailed projected capacity utilization and corresponding production
volume are shown in the projected income statement in Annex 6-4.
2/   See Annex 4-1 for assumptions regarding number of operating days
for Sections I and II.

Production Volume and Import of Yarn and Roving for 1978-1981

Production:  Section I
Roving (tons)                  -      1,200    3,000    4,000

Production:  Section II
Woven Roving (1,000 m2)       270      1,015    1,070    1,070
Fabrics (1,000 m2)          1,230     4,685    4,930    4,930
Tubes (1,000 m)               825     3,135    3,300    3,300
Tapes (1,000 m)             2,500     9,500   10,000   10,000
6.03      The gap which derives from the different start-up times for the
weaving and finishing plant on the one hand and the spinning plant on the
other, provides a welcome phasing during which the Enterprise can solve any
problems in the weaving and finishing operation using imported roving and
yarn. The weaving and finishing department should be operating well in 1979
(at an expected capacity utilization of 95%), allowing the gradual phasing in
of roving and yarn produced in the Enterprise's own spinning department.
2.   Value of Production
6.04      Prices:  As is practice for new products in Romania, producer
prices have been approved by the State Committee for Prices on the basis
of projected production costs plus a margin of 10% of production costs for
profit (benefit). These prices, like all prices in Romania, will be subject
to only minor modifications (if at all) and will normally be fixed at least
for the period of the current Five-Year-Plan. The detailed price list is
shown in Annex 6-1.
6.05      Gross Production and Gross Product:  Two important plan indicators
of Romanian enterprises are (a) the gross production which counts the pro-
duction of Section I (roving and yarn) and of Section II (woven roving,
fabric, tubes and tapes) at their respective prices, and therefore, includes
double counting of roving and yarn consumed in Section II, and (b) the gross
product which deducts this consumption of roving and yarn. In the financial
projections which do not include changes in finished goods inventory the gross
product is equivalent to sales revenues. At full capacity utilization, the
Project will reach an annual gross production of Lei 327.2 million (US$16.4
million) and a gross product (= sales revenues) of Lei 269.8 million (US$13.5
million).
B.   Production Cost
6.06      Detailed production costs, with quantities and unit prices, are
shown in Annex 6-2. At full capacity utilization, annual costs are estimated
at Lei 187.7 million (US$9.4 million) as follows:



- 19 -
Annual Production Cost at Full Capacity
(Prices of 1976)
(Million Lei)         (%)
Raw Materials                      20.2           10.7
Auxiliary Materials                35.1           18.7
Maintenance Materials              17.0            9.0

Reserve for Relining                4.0            2.1
Contingency                         3.7            2.0
187.7         100.0
6.07      All raw materials except calcium fluoride, which represents only
2.3% of the raw material cost, come from local sources. Sizing materials
make up 70% of the estimated cost of auxiliary materials. Initially, these
sizing materials will be imported, but the know-how to be made available
by the suppliers for Section I and II will include the formulation for the
sizing materials, and the Enterprise and the suppliers will identify suitable
Romanian enterprises to produce these sizing materials locally soon after
Project start-up.
6.08      About 68% of the production costs are fixed and 32% are variable.
Maintenance materials have been calculated at 2% of fixed assets. Deprecia-
tion is on a 12-year straight-line basis, in line with Romanian depreciation
schedules. The life expectancy of the furnaces is about three years, after
which relining takes place (para. 4.02). One-third of the estimated cost of
relining (Lei 12 million) is debited each year in the form of a "reserve for
relining".
C.   Financial Projections
6.09      The projected financial statements for the Enterprise are summarized
below. The assumptions used are listed in Annex 6-3, the projected income
statement in Annex 6-4, the cash flow statement in Annex 6-5, and the balance
sheet statement in Annex 6-6, all for 10 years.

c/   Full capacity utilization for spinning plant (Section I).
6.10      The Enterprise is expected to incur losses during the first two
years of operation. The State will make up any resulting cash deficits.
The Project's profit break-even point is estimated to be at 61% capacity
utilization. A break-even chart is shown in Annex 6-7.
6.11      The financial projections do not provide for price changes since
all prices in Romania are controlled and revised by the State Committee for
Prices only after fairly lengthy intervals (para. 2.04).
6.12      As explained in para. 5.05 above, projects in Romania are financed
fully on a "non-interest-bearing-capital" basis, but funds are recovered by
the State through payments from the Enterprise into several state funds. In
order to indicate the amounts of interest and principal due to the IBRD,
payments by the Enterprise equivalent to the actual payment due to the Bank
are shown in the projected cash flow statement and so is a "notional" debt
service coverage, relating benefit plus depreciation to debt service on the
Bank loan. Since the Bank loan finances only 42% of total project cost, this
notional debt service coverage in all years is relatively high (above 2.5
times).
6.13      As mentioned previously, the capital advanced by the State to
different enterprises for their projects is returned to the State in the form



- 21 -
of payments into several funds. Firstly, an amount equivalent to the Enter-
prise's annual depreciation is paid into the "depreciation fund". In the
financial projections for this Project, principal repayment on the Bank loan
has been considered as an advance payment into this depreciation fund and
correspondingly deducted from the payment into that fund. Secondly, an amount
equivalent to 10% of the planned benefit of the Enterprise must be paid into
the State budget. Thirdly, the Enterprise can pay a bonus to workers, not
exceeding 2% of total labor cost. Fourthly, the equivalent of 1% of net
working capital can be retained by the Enterprise in the form of a reserve
fund to increase its working capital. All remaining funds are transferred to
the State budget, except for very small bank balances and petty cash. Assur-
ance was obtained that in any given year after 1980 the sum of annual benefit
and depreciation remitted by the Enterprise to the State shall be at least
sufficient to cover the equivalent in Lei of the interest and principal to be
paid by the Investment Bank in that same year to the Bank, except that an
interest rate of 10% shall be applied.
D.   Financial Rate of Return
6.14      With an expected life after start-up of 12 years, the Project
yields a financial rate of return of 11% (Annex 6-8). The results of the
sensitivity analysis of this return are as follows:
Sensitivity of Financial Rate of Return
1.   Base Case                                                 11.0%
2.   Production Cost up 5%                                      9.9%
3.   Production Cost up 10%                                     8.8%
4.   Project Cost up 5%                                         9.8%
5.   Delay of 6 Months in Start-up                              9.0%
6.   Delay of 6 Months in Reaching Full Capacity                8.0%
Increases in production costs beyond the projected level are considered un-
likely, since production costs have been estimated with due allowance for
the possibility of lower efficiency of plant operation in early years. Chances
of an increase in project costs are also low. However, because of the tight
implementation schedule, a delay in project start-up is possible. A six-month
delay would reduce the rate of return to 9.0%. There is also a certain
probability that the attainment of full capacity utilization might be somewhat
delayed due to operator inexperience; as one such (extreme) case, the possibil-
ity of a 6-month delay has been considered which would reduce the project's
financial return by 3 percentage points.
E.   Auditing and Reporting
6.15      Romania has an elaborate audit system under which enterprises
submit periodic operational and financial reports to their Central, Ministry
and Investment and National Banks. These reports serve to ensure achievement
of plan targets and proper use of funds. Though the contents and presentation



- 22 -
of these reports differ from those normally received by the Bank, it is
possible to adjust them to provide sufficient information for the Bank to
adequately monitor the progress of project implementation and operations.
The Bank's reporting requirements were discussed during negotiations,
and agreement was reached that the Enterprise will submit quarterly progress
reports and annual financial statements, in a form satisfactory to the Bank,
and that the Bank will receive within three months after the end of each year
copies of annual audit reports of the Enterprise prepared by the Ministry of
Finance.
F.   Risks
6.16      The Project faces few risks, the only important one being initial
problems in reaching full capacity utilization or high quality production
in Section I, due to operator inexperience. However, through the proposed
training program and the guarantee from the licensor/contractor, who ensure
that the plant will achieve the specified production program quantitatively
and qualitatively, all reasonable precautions against this eventuality have
been taken. The possibility of the actual growth rate in Romanian glass
fiber consumption falling below the substantial increase provided for in the
current Five-Year-Plan is small because of the nature of Romania's planned
economy where the expansion of new production facilities is closely coordi-
nated with the expansion of consuming industries. Furthermore, the expected
rapid growth of glass fiber consumption starts from a low base and there
remain important applications of GRP not yet considered (automotive industry,
boat building and sporting goods), which would be introduced should this be
necessary for maintaining the planned growth rate for consumption.
VII. ECONOMIC ANALYSIS
A.   Economic Costs and Benefits and Rate of Return
7.01      International prices, at the conversion rate of Lei 20 per US
Dollar, have been used for tradable, and domestic prices for non-tradable
goods and services, for purposes of calculating the economic costs and
benefits of the Project. Project costs have been kept at their financial
value, except for import duties which have been deleted (Annex 7-1). Pro-
duction costs were adjusted as follows. For quartz sand, the potential export
price is estimated to be 40% above the Romanian price, and for boric acid
50%.  For electric power, which has a Romanian price of USJ 1.5 per kwh, the
economic price has been assumed to be USJ 2.25 per kwh (+50%). For natural
gas, for which the Romanian price is Lei 0.2 per Nm3 (USe 28 per MMSCF), the
economic price has been estimated to be Lei 1.4 per Nm3 (US$1.96 per MMSCF)
or plus 600% on the basis of the current import price of crude oil. On this
basis, the economic production costs amount to 117% of the financial production
costs (Annex 7-2).
7.02      As discussed earlier (para. 3.06), Romanian import prices in 1976
were slightly below domestic prices in the USA, Western Europe and Japan, but



- 23 -
are expected to increase to the same level as the existing surplus production
capacity in the three main markets disappears. In order to determine the
competitiveness of the Project, its projected production costs for Section I
(expressed in economic prices) have been compared with those of an existing
plant in Western Europe which started production in 1976 (Annex 7-3), and
both have been found to be very close (see below). This is so since prac-
tically all raw materials for the Project come from Romanian sources, and
Romanian labor costs are below those in more developed countries and offset
slightly higher cost of investment and of maintenance materials. At full
capacity operation, the Western European plant (which has a production
capacity of 13,000 tpy) has average production costs, including a return on
investment, of US$1.92 per kg of roving and yarn as compared to US$2.03 for
the Project, both in the product mix as planned for Section I (4,000 tpy of
roving and 2,000 tpy of yarn). Annex 7-4 shows that the current average
ex-factory price in the USA, Western Europe and Japan is about US$2 per kg
whereas it is US$1.73 in Romania. As indicated by the cost analysis of the
Western European plant, world market prices will have to be at a level of
about US$2.00 per kg in 1976 terms (c.i.f. Romania) in order to yield a
satisfactory return on investments. Using this price level, the Project
yields an economic rate of return of 16.5% (Annex 7-5).
7.03      The sensitivity of the economic rate of return is shown below:
Sensitivity of Economic Rate of Return
Base Case                                         16.5
Import Prices Equal Romanian Prices               10.2
Production Cost up 5%                             15.4
Project Cost up 5%                                15.5
Delay of 6 Months in Start-up                     14.7
Delay of 6 Months in Reaching
Full Capacity                                   14.0
As in the case of the financial rate of return, a delay in reaching full
capacity utilization due to operator inexperience is the most likely cause
of a reduction in the economic rate of return. However, during preparation
of the training program by the suppliers and the Enterprise, care will be
taken to minimize this risk through extensive training of Romanian staff.
B.   Employment and Foreign Exchange Effects
7.04      The Project will employ about 1,200 persons representing an invest-
ment of about US$38,000 per person employed. Therefore, the Project can be
considered as relatively labor-intensive. At full capacity it will yield net
annual foreign exchange savings (before amortization of the Bank loan) of
about US$12 million.



- 24 -
C.   Transfer of Technology and Future Possibilities
7.05      The Project will introduce in Romania the new technology of glass
fiber production by the direct-melt process. The supplier of the technology
will also undertake to provide for a period of five years after start-up free
of additional charge information of all improvements in design or operation
that become freely available to him from the operation of his own plants or
other plants using his technology. The Romanians in turn will undertake to
provide similar information to the supplier. This creates a link between the
operation of the Project and the operation of other plants using the same
technology. The exchange of information excludes improvements which are
patented or could fundamentally change the technology or operating economy
of the plant, but in the case of such latter information, the Romanians will
be notified of its existence and will have the option to purchase it.
7.06      The start of large-scale glass fiber production in Romania is
only the first step in introducing this material. As has been discussed
above (para. 3.08) there are important applications for glass fiber not yet
considered in Romania but already very important in more developed countries,
where the use of glass fiber reinforced plastic would provide superior perfor-
mance or replace more expensive materials. It is, therefore, the intention
of the Romanians to build additional glass fiber production facilities soon
after completion of this important Project to meet increasing demand.
VIII. AGREEMENTS
8.01      Agreement has been reached as follows:
(i) the Investment Bank will supervise the execution of
the Project and the procurement of goods and services
required for it (para. 2.05);
(ii) the Enterprise will submit by December 31, 1977, a de-
tailed training program that is acceptable to the Bank
(para. 4.09);
(iii) the Enterprise will operate the pollution control facil-
ities with due regard to ecological, environmental and
safety factors (para. 4.10);
(iv) the Government will make available the funds needed for
the Project (para. 5.07);
(v) the Enterprise will remit to the State in any given
year after 1980 an amount of benefit and depreciation at
least sufficient to cover the Lei equivalent of interest
and principal due in that same year on the Bank loan
except that an interest charge of 10% shall be applied
(para. 6.13);



- 25 -
(vi) the Enterprise will submit quarterly progress reports and
annual financial statements in a form satisfactory to the
Bank, and the Ministry of Finance will submit within three
months after the end of each year its annual audit report
of the Enterprise (para. 6.15).
8.02      With the above agreements the Project is suitable for a Bank loan
to the Investment Bank, equivalent to US$18.3 million for 15 years, including
3 years of grace, at an interest rate of 8.2% p.a.

THE MINISTRY OF LIGHT INDUSTRY
Introduction
1.        There are ten "technical" ministries in Romania, each of them
responsible for the preparation and implementation of the annual plan, the
Five-Year-Plan and the Long-term (Perspective) Plan for a major sector of
the economy. Each ministry has under it industrial centrals which direct
the operations of a group of enterprises of related activity. Centrals can
be considered as "holding companies" of all enterprises in one particular
subbranch of the economy. Besides the centrals, the ministries have spec-
ialized design institutes and foreign trade enterprises for their respective
sectors.
The Centrals
2.        The Ministry of Light Industry controls the following eight centrals:
(i) Central for Glass and Fine Ceramics
Production of consumer goods and technical goods made of
glass, china and ceramics, the operation of sand pits for
quartz sand, and research in the field of glass and fine
ceramics technology. This central will be responsible for
the Bucharest Glass Fiber Project (for details see Annex
2-2).
(ii) Central for Cotton Products
Production of cotton yarn, and cotton and blended fabrics.
(iii) Central for Silk, Flax and Hemp Products
Processing of silk cocoons, the production of silk, flax and
hemp yarns and pure as well as blended fabrics of these.
(iv) Central for Wool Products
Production of woolen yarns and pure as well as blended fabrics.
(v) Central for Knitwear
Production of knitted goods.

THE CENTRAL FOR GLASS AND FINE CERAMICS
Responsibility and Organization
1.        The Central for Glass and Fine Ceramics (CISCF) is responsible
for the planning and production of glass products such as glass containers,
table glass, flat glass, technical and optical glass, the production of
chinaware and pottery. It directs the operations of its constituent enter-
prises. The Central prepares the development and production plan for its
industrial branch, based on proposals from the enterprises, passing it on
through its ministry (in the case of CISCF, the Ministry of Light Industry),
to the Council of Ministers for coordination of and incorporation in the
national (five-year or annual) plan. The Central coordinates the purchase
of raw materials and the sale of products. It decides over the research
program of its Research Institute for the Glass and Ceramics Industry. The
seat of CISCF is Bucharest.
2.        CISCF employs about 40,000 people in its 26 production enterprises,
which are 16 enterprises to manufacture glass containers and table glass,
4 enterprises to manufacture flatglass and flatglass products, 3 enterprises
to manufacture chinaware and pottery, 2 enterprises operating sand pits, and
I semi-commercial plant for glass fiber.
3.        Summarized financial statements for CISCF are shown in Table 1 for
1974 and 1975 (actual) and 1976 to 1980 (the current Five-Year-Plan period).
The Semi-Commercial Plant for Glass Fiber
4.        In 1974, a plant designed to produce 1,000 tpy of glass fiber was
commissioned. This plant has been designed by the Design Institute of the
Ministry for Building Materials with assistance from an Italian engineering
firm and has a design capacity for 300 tpy of roving and 700 tpy of mat.
Most of the equipment is manufactured in Romania. The plant currently uses
imported marbles, but these are in short supply since the marbles process is
gradually being replaced by the direct-melt process (see Annex 4-1), and a
unit to make marbles was recently bought from the People's Republic of China
and is currently being supplied for start of production in late 1977. In
1974, the glass fiber plant produced a total of 76 tons, in 1975 a total of
436 tons, and in 1976 about 500 tons. Lack of platinum/ rhodium, of which
the marbles process requires about twice as much per ton of plant capacity as
the direct-melt process, kept the production at this low level of capacity
utilization. It is planned to produce at full capacity in 1977. However,
because of the higher energy requirements, Pt/Rh requirements and higher
material losses, the production costs of this small plant are about 40% above
those of the Project. The plant employs 110 people. Although the technology
of this plant is much simpler, it will be useful for the training of operating
staff for the Project.

WORLD MARKET FOR GLASS FIBER
General Outline
1.        Production and consumption of continuous glass fiber is concentrated
in the USA, Western Europe and Japan which account for 85 to 90% of the
total world market. Some minor production capacity also exists in Canada,
Latin America and Eastern Europe. The technology to produce continuous glass
fiber was developed in the USA in the 1930's. After World War II, some
companies in France, UK and Japan developed their own technology (starting
with licenses purchased from the USA), but today there are still only half
a dozen companies in the world with a well-established technology in this
field. Therefore, these companies are in a position to control the interna-
tional market, either through participation or licensing agreements with most
producers (Table 1). Table 2 lists the number of glass fiber plants in each
country.
World Capacity, Production and Consumption
2.        Table 3 shows the world capacity in 1975 at 780,000 tons per year
led by the USA with 390,000 tpy (50%), followed by Western Europe with 222,000
tpy (29%), Japan with 120,000 tpy (15%) and the remaining producing countries
with 48,000 tpy (6%). Table 4 shows the production in 1970 to 1975 for
major producing countries and their estimated production capacity in 1976 and
1977. It shows that while production increased steadily from 1970 to 1974
(from an estimated total world production of 400,000 tons in 1970 to 610,000
tons in 1974), world production fell off sharply in 1975 to an estimated level
of 460 to 500,000 tons, indicating a level of capacity utilization of only
about 60%, which was caused by the general recession in the synthetic fiber
industry in that year. Total world production capacity in 1976 is estimated to
have been about 800,000 tons, and expected to increase to 875 to 900,000 tons
in 1977.
3.        Consumption figures for some countries in 1975 are shown in Table 3.
They show that in that year of relatively depressed consumption levels, the
per capita consumption in Western Europe ranged from 0.3 kg in Italy, Spain
and Austria to 0.7 kg in Western Germany and Netherlands. This compares
with a 1975 per capita consumption in Japan of 0.4 kg and the USA of 1.0 kg.
The increase in per capita consumption with passage of time is indicated in
Table 5 which shows shipments by US producers to the domestic and export
market, and US imports and estimated US consumption of glass fiber for the
period 1960 to 1976. During that period, US per capita consumption in-
creased from 0.37 kg to 1.45 kg in 1973 after which it fell off to 1.33 kg
in 1974 and 1.00 kg in 1975, due to the general recession in those latter
years, but returned to 1.28 kg in 1976.



ANNEX 3-2
Page 2
4.        Table 6 compares US production capacity as reported by the industry
with actual production during the years 1970 to 1976. It shows that during
that entire period, reported production capacity was in excess of actual
production, with average capacity utilization reaching a maximum of 93% in
1973, falling to only 60% in 1975 but returning to 73% in 1976.
5.        Table 7 shows the actual consumption of glass fiber in the main
consuming areas in 1973 and 1975 and the projected consumption level for
1980. This projection is based on an analysis of the GRP markets by end-use
sector and their development trends, as shown in Table 8. Glass fiber con-
sumption in the main consuming areas is expected to grow from about 523,000
tons in 1973 and about 430,000 tons in 1975 to about 800,000 tons in 1980,
representing an expected annual growth rate of 6.25% over the level of 1973
or 10.5% over the depressed level of 1975. Japan is expected to show the
highest growth rate in 1973 to 1980 (11% per year) and to more than double
the level of consumption, from 67,000 tons in 1973 to about 140,000 tons
in 1980. Western Europe is expected to have a growth rate of 8% per year,
versus 4% per year for the USA. Western Europe is expected to increase its
level of consumption to about 250,000 tons and the USA to 410,000 tons in
1980. Per capita consumption in 1980 will continue to be highest in the
USA, at 1.4 kg, while Japan will overtake Western Europe in per capita con-
sumption, estimated to reach 1.1 kg against 0.8 kg in Western Europe. The
growth rates projected for 1973 to 1980 are below the rates experienced prior
to 1973. They reflect the uncertainty surrounding future growth rates for
the economies in the developed world. The estimated 1977 production capacity
in the USA, Western Europe and Japan is about 820,000 tons. A consumption
level of 800,000 tons in 1980 would, therefore, nearly fully utilize this
capacity. No demand projections for countries outside the USA, Western
Europe and Japan are available, but total consumption in these countries
is unlikely to exceed 150,000 tons in 1980. The total world production
capacity is estimated to be 875 to 900,000 tons in 1977, indicating that
additional capacity of 50 to 75,000 tpy needs to be built between 1977 and
1980 to meet projected world demand in 1980.
World Market Prices
6.        Prices of glass fiber products differ in the three largest markets,
USA, Western Europe and Japan. Lowest prices are found in USA, while in
Japan and especially in Western Europe quotations for the same articles are
normally higher. The explanation is found in the lower cost of raw materials
and, in particular, natural gas in the USA. During the recent gas curtail-
ments, source manufacturers in the USA had to shut down their plants or
operate at reduced levels of capacity utilization. Other plants which were
able to switch to other fuels, such as propane, raised their prices by a
special energy surcharge of about US54 per kg. Average 1976 prices within
the three markets are shown below:

2/   Minimum quotation for heavier fabrics; maximum quotation

7.        In the past, domestic prices in the main markets have steadily
risen to reflect increasing raw material, labor and energy costs, even in
times of reduced capacity utilization such as 1975, as shown below for two
products in Italy and Federal Republic of Germany. The high level of con-
centration in the industry most likely accounts for this resistance of
prices against downward pressure.

8.        Exports prices for products originating from the three main market
areas were in 1976 below domestic prices, and, on an average, Romanian import
prices have been somewhat below domestic prices in the three main markets.
However, as it is projected that the current level of excess capacity will
gradually be reduced through increasing demand, Romanian import prices are
expected to move towards the level of domestic prices. Romania is currently
importing roving, yarn, woven roving, tapes and tubes from Japan, France,
Belgium, Sweden, and fabrics from Czechoslovakia (CSSR). The table below
summarizes current import prices.

ROMANIAN MARKET FOR GLASS FIBER
Past Consumption, Production and Import
1.        Romanian glass fiber consumption, production and import in the years
1971 to 1976 is shown below. Consumption began to develop in the late sixties
at a very rapid rate (50% p.a. on an average). Local production started in
1974 (with the semi-commercial plant at Bucharest for roving and mat) and
reached 515.8 tons in 1976, about 38% of consumption (1,344.8 tons) in that
year. The remainder was imported, some small quantities from Czechoslovakia,
the rest from Western Europe and Japan.

End-Use Sectors of Glass Fiber
2.        Until now, electrical application (insulation) and reinforcing of
plastic tanks and pipes for the chemical industry have been the main appli-
cations of glass fiber in Romania. Within the current Five-Year-Plan
(1976-80), the production capacity of some major users of glass fiber will be
expanded considerably, particularly in the field of GRP building materials
(para. 5 through 7). The current structure of consumption by end-use sector
and the anticipated change are shown below:
Structure of Glass Fiber Consumption
in Romania by End-Use in 1975 and 1980
(Percent of Total Weight)
1975        1980
Building Materials          5           52
Chemical Plants            62           13
Electrical Application    33            35
100         100
A comparison with the structure of consumption by end-use sector in the mar-
kets of Western Europe, USA and Japan (see Annex 3-2 Table 8) shows that in
those three main markets the sectors of building materials, chemical plants
and electrical appliances constituted in 1975 only slightly more than one-
half of the entire glass fiber consumption. Other important end-use sec-
tors are the automotive and other transport industry and the boat building
industry (one quarter of glass fiber consumption in USA). However, these
applications are not yet being considered in Romania.
3.        Table 1 shows the projected product mix for the Project on which
the design capacity of 6,000 tpy has been established, and the intended
end-use. This end-use is based on a protocol signed between the Ministry of
Light Industry on the one hand as supplier, and the Ministries (i) for
Chemical Industry, (ii) for Machine Tools and Electrotechnical Industry and
(iii) for Forestry and Building Materials, on the other hand, as consumers.
Projected Consumption, Production and Import
4.        The projected consumption, production and import of glass fiber
in Romania for the period 1977 through 1985 are shown in Table 2. The figures
for 1977 through 1980 are based on the targets of the current Five-Year-Plan,
but modified to take into account delays in the implementation of projects
consuming glass fiber. Consumption is expected to increase from about 1,345
tons in 1976 to about 3,930 tons in 1977 (192% over 1976, but only 150%
over 1975). It is expected to reach about 7,100 tons by 1980 or by about 50%
p.a. over 1976. Growth of consumption after 1980 has been assumed at 10%
p.a., reaching 11,440 tons in 1985. Production has been assumed to be limited



ANNEX 3-3
Page 3
to the combined capacity of the semi-commercial plant (1,000 tpy) and the
project (6,000 tpy). The remainder to fully meet expected consumption has
been assumed to be imported.
5.        The construction materials industry, for which the current Five-
Year-Plan foresees a growth rate of about 10% p.a. is implementing several
projects which will substantially increase the consumption of glass fiber:
(i) A factory in Bucharest which currently has a capacity for
100 tpy of GRP items (corrugated sheet and skylights)
manufactured by a discontinuous process (contact molding)
will start in the second quarter of 1977 a fully automated
production line with a capacity of 5,000 tpy of GRP items,
mainly flat and corrugated sheet and sanitary appliances.
It will consume 2,200 tpy of roving;
(ii) A factory in Berceni, currently manufacturing bituminized
water proofing sheets will adopt glass fabrics as a support.
Consumption will be 500 tpy of fabric;
(iii) Two new factories in Vaslui and Simleul-Silvaniei are under
implementation for production of bituminized sheets in 1979.
Their combined consumption will be 500 tpy of fabric;
(iv) Cotton currently used for carpet backing will be replaced by
glass fiber because of its superior strength. This will
require about 500 tpy of yarn.
6.        In the electrotechnical industry, for which the current Five-Year-
Plan foresees an average growth rate of 21% p.a., there are two main consumers
of glass fiber: the enterprise ICME (Enterprise for Manufacture of Cables
and Electric Insulation Materials) in Bucharest, and the enterprise ELECTRO-
PUTERE (Enterprise for Heavy Electric Engineering Goods) in Craiova. ICME
used in 1976 52 tons of yarn, 2.2 million m of fabric (about 220 tons) and 2.8
million linear meter of tubes (about 15.5 tons), or a total of about 290 tons.
Expansion of production capacity currently underway, will increase its fiber
glass consumption in 1980 to 130 tons of yarn, 9 million m of fabrics and 4
million meter of tubes, or about 1,050 tons of glass fiber. ELECTROPUTERE
used 750,000 m of fabrics (97.44 tons) and 1.2 million linear meter of tapes
in 1976. Its consumption is expected to increase in 1980 to about 200 tons.
7.        The chemical industry, for which the current Five-Year-Plan foresees
a growth rate of 16% p.a., requires glass fiber for tank, vessel and pipe
reinforcing (GRP). The main producer of GRP tanks is the enterprise I.U.C.
(Enterprise for Chemical Installations) in Fagaras. Its consumption of
glass fiber of about 460 tons in 1976 is expected to increase to about 915
tons in 1980.

Grand Total          7,100  100.0
9.        The projected increase in glass fiber consumption, though substan-
tial, would still leave the level of per capita consumption below that in
other countries. Per capita consumption in Romania was 0.06 kg in 1976 and
would in increase to 0.32 kg in 1980 and 0.49 kg in 1985 on the basis of the
projected consumption. The projected per capita consumption of 1980 corres-
ponds to the US per capita consumption of the late 1950's, and the 1975 per
capita consumption of Spain, Italy and Austria.

BUCHAREST GLASS FIBER PROJECT
PROJECT DESCRIPTION
I. Introduction
1.        The Project will consist of two main sections.  In the first section
(spinning department) 6,000 tpy of roving and yarn will be produced, and in
the second section about 1,270 tpy of roving and yarn will be converted into
woven roving, yarn fabrics, tapes and braided tubes. The remainder will be
sold as roving and yarn. While Section I involves highly specialized tech-
nology, Section II involves weaving and finishing technology similar to that
used for other fibers in the textile industry. A material flow chart is
presented in Chart 1. The plant will be located in Militari, an industrial
estate in the southwestern outskirts of Bucharest. This location has been
selected in view of (a) the existing infrastructure and utilities in the
industrial estate, a section of which has been assigned to the Ministry of
Light Industry, and (b) the central position of Bucharest, which is also the
location of the main consumers, in the Romanian highway and railroads systems
which will keep transportation costs for raw materials and finished goods at
a minimum (IBRD Map 12652RI).
II. Spinning Department (Section I)
2.        The manufacturing process in Section I consists of three main
stages (i) glass manufacture, (ii) drawing of continuous fibers, (iii) the
conversion of fibers into roving and yarn. Steps (i) and (ii) are continuous
processes, but only an average operation of 330 days per year (7,920 hours)
has been assumed in order to account for the relining of furnaces at the end
of their campaign life (para. 7), while for step (iii) 306 days per year in 3
shifts per day (7,344 hours) have been assumed. A list of the main equipment
proposed for Section I is given in Table 1.
Glass Composition
3.        Commercial glass is primarily based on silica (in the form of
quartz sand) and is obtained by fusing a mixture of materials at elevated
temperatures.  To silica (Si02), other materials are added to lower its
melting temperature. Other ingredients are added to provide the desired
balance of finished glass properties. Electrical properties of glass are
governed by the presence of alkali, e.g. the Na 20 and K20 conte 6s.  The
resistance of,t1he alkali - containing "A" glass per meter is 10   ohm com-
pared with 10   ohm for the almost alkali-free "E" glass. 1/  Typical glass
I/   "A" glass (alkali-containing), "E" glass (electrical resistance), "C"
glass (chemically resistant), "S" glass (high strength).

compositions are shown below. The constituents are commonly introduced in
compounded forms, such as in this Project as quartz sand, limestone, dolomite,
boric acid, salt cake, calcined alumina and calcium fluoride.

Handling, Weighing and Mixing of Raw Materials
4.        All raw materials will be received in bags, which will be emptied
into storage silos. From the silos materials will be delivered to weighing
equipment and into the batch mixer. This technology is quite similar to that
applied in other processes using batches of solid raw materials as feedstock.
Homogeneous composition of the glass is of primary importance and requires
suitable weighing equipment (with an accuracy of at least +0.5%), accurate
mixing equipment, and conveying of the batch to the furnace batch charger in
such a manner that no segregation of raw materials occurs. The batch plant
will be sized to produce approximately 35 tons of mixed batch per day.
The Furnace Melter and Forehearth
5.        The batch is fed into the melting section of the furnace for conver-
sion into molten glass. Batch feeding is usually done at one end of the fur-
nace, by double or single screw feeders. The project will have two furnaces.
Each furnace comprises a melter, fired with natural gas, and a set of fore-
hearth, also fired with natural gas, which feed molten glass to a number
of filament forming bushings attached to the underside of the forehearth.
Details of the furnace equipment are presented in Chart 2. The capacity of
each furnace has been designed so that full production in downstream facil-
ities can be maintained even in the year refractory relining takes place,
through the prior stockpiling of strands.



ANNEX 4-1
Page 3
6.        The temperature above the glass surface is generally around 1,600 C.
The glass depth in the tank must be carefully controlled and set in every
zone of the furnace so that, despite the negative downwards temperature
gradient, the glass at the bottom is always over the devitrifiL.tion tempera-
ture (1,130-1,140C) which would cause crystalline inclusions in the glass.
Owing to the high temperature and the fact that at these temperatures "E"
glass is very corrosive on most refractories, the choice of refractory mate-
rials giving reasonable life and good quality of glass is of the utmost im-
portance and represents a major component of the know-how. The temperature
and corrosion effects are highly variable in the different zones of the
furnace, and protective materials must be chosen accordingly.
7.        The manufacture of glass from the mixed batch materials is a con-
tinuous process during the whole life of the furnace. A campaign life will
last 3-4 years at a maximum, at the end of which the furnace is dismantled
and remade with new refractories. The time needed for this is around 12
weeks.
Fiber Drawing
8.        Continuous glass fibers are currently produced by either of two
processes: the marbles or the direct-melt process. In the marbles process,
glass spheres (marbles) having a diameter of about 20 mm are made from the
furnace and later re-melted for spinning. Spinning can either be performed
in the same plant producing the marbles, or in another plant which purchases
the marbles. The marbles process is generally used when small productions
are involved.
9.        In the "direct-melt process", molten glass is drawn directly into
fibers. The filament forming bushings are attached to the underside of the
forehearth. They are made of platinum/rhodium alloy and are individually
electrical-resistence heated in order to bring the glass to a convenient
degree of viscosity for spinning. Glass fibers are produced by drawing
filaments from each stream of molten glass as it drops from the orifices in
the base of the bushings. Streams are pulled into desired diameters by high
speed winders. The combination of temperature, configuration of the orifices
in the bushings and the winder speed control the diameter of the filament. A
number of filaments are formed simultaneously, gathered into a bundle called
a "strand" and treated with a protective binder.  The strand is wound onto
forming tubes, or "packages", for drying and curing in ovens before conver-
sion to other forms.
Surface Treatment or Sizing
10.       Because glass filaments abrade each other easily, protective surface
treatment is applied immediately after the filaments are formed and before
they are wound. This treatment also bonds the filaments into a strand so they
can be handled, and includes a coupling agent which later improves glass-resin
adhesion. Sizing material formulations are of two types: (a) a complex
starch-oil emulsion applied on yarn intended for glass fiber textile material



ANNEX 4-1
Page 4
(twisting, plying, or weaving) and (b) a chemical mixture, mostly composed
of an organic, resinous film former, a wetting agent, and a surface active
agent, and applied to glass fiber intended for direct GRP utilization.
11.       Glass fiber manufacturers for yarn are more concerned with filament
protection than with coupling capability during the production of fibrous
glass materials for woven fabrics, because of the great degree of glass
abrasion encountered in weaving. For these materials, the protective binder
must be burned off yarns and fabrics (heat cleaned) after weaving and a
coupling agent or finish applied to improve glass-resin adhesion. During
size application, a considerable amount of sizes are wasted, i.e. are not
picked up by the fiber, however efficient the applicators may be designed.
Sizes can only partially be recirculated, thus representing a problem of
waste water treatment, although the volumes involved are of relatively low
magnitude.
Manufacture of Roving and Twisted Yarn
12.       After being dried and cured, the packages of strands are ready
for the manufacture of roving and twisted yarn. Rovings are obtained by
winding up a number of strands (6 to 60) to produce a bonded package. Yarns
are single strands which have been given a definite twist (measured in
turns per meter or inch) in order to impart them with specific mechanical
strength and properties in view of their subsequent utilization, mainly for
weaving. Plied yarns are obtained by twisting several strands together
simultaneously. After being twisted, yarns are wound onto bobbins of various
shapes and dimensions.
Production Losses
13.       During the different production steps, from batch preparation
until the obtainment of roving and yarn, considerable material losses are
likely to be encountered that must be taken into account in establishing the
process material balance and in calculating total raw material requirement.
Losses are mainly in relation with chemical modifications and volatility of
some raw materials during melting and with events such as fiber breakage
during attenuation or during winding operations. Average losses in the
different steps of Section I are shown in the table below. A material flow
chart is attached to this annex.

III. Weaving and Finishing Department (Section II)
14.       This department is similar in its conception to those in conven-
tional textile industry. Machinery is also similar with some modifications
in order to meet special requirements for the weaving and finishing of glass
fibers which are inelastic and abrasive. The capacity of Section II is based
on 306 operating days per year in 3 shifts per day (7,344 hours). A list of
the equipment foreseen for Section II is in the attached Table 2.
Preparation of Yarn and Roving for Weaving,or Braiding
15.       Packages of roving and yarn (single and plied) will be prepared
on a number of machines in order to get them ready for weaving and braiding.
These machines are the following:
(i) Beam warpers: a multitude of warp yarns are wound on a
cylindrical body so as to permit removal of these yarn
as a warp sheet;
(ii) Warp sizing machines: application of size to yarns,
normally through the immersion of the yarns into the
size solution, followed by squeezing and drying. This
treatment is applied to warp yarn in order to reduce the
number of broken filaments which result from mechanical
abrasion during weaving;
(iii) Reaching and drawing-in machines: entering the ends of
the warp yarns into the loom;
(iv) Pirn winders: winding of weft yarn on pirns for insertion
into the shuttles.
Weaving and Braiding
16.       Weaving of yarn fabrics is performed on shuttle looms and of roving
on shuttleless looms. Braiding machines are used for the manufacture of
tubes:
(i) Shuttle looms: conventional looms to weave yarns. Two
sets of yarns (warp and weft) are interlaced. The weft
is inserted during weaving by projecting a pirn carrier
or shuttle through the warp shed.
(ii) Shuttleless looms: In shuttleless looms the weft is fed
from one or both sides of the loom by means of spears which
insert the weft roving in the warp. As a spear reaches the
end of its stroke a peg located at the edge of the cloth
holds the roving while the spear withdraws, and the roving
is cut. These looms are used for weaving roving because of
the weight of the weft that would have to be thrown forth and
back if a shuttle were used.



ANNEX 4-1
Page 6
(iii) Braiding machines: round braided tubes are made of yarn that
is interlaced by a process similar to that of conventional
braiding.
Finishing
17.       Chemical and other treatment is used to make the fabrics more
capable of fulfilling their specific function. Therefore, the treatment
is quite different according to the end use of the fabric, i.e. whether
it will be used for industrial purposes (for example, in the manufacturing
of GRP articles) or for upholstery.
(i) Finishing of industrial fabrics: the sizing applied to
the yarns in order to make them more suitable for weaving
would jeopardize good adhesion of glass fibers with resins
or insulating laquers during subsequent utilization. There-
fore, this size must be removed by means of a chemical or
thermal treatment (at a temperature of about 4000 C), and
new sizes of suitable formulation for each specific end-
use are applied.
(ii) Finishing of fabrics for upholstery: a "coronization"
treatment is usually applied. This consists of a number
of treatments which give a glass fabric the same softness,
lightness and anti-crease properties as any other fabric
for upholstery. First a thermal treatment is applied, in
order to burn off the size from the filaments and to
eliminate, by annealing the glass, any tension which might
have been generated in the fiber during weaving. As a
consequence, fabrics will gain in softness and have the
appearance of a silk cloth. Subsequently, a chemical
treatment is made with a finishing agent which will improve
abrasion resistance, water-proof properties, washability
and color resistance.
Material Losses in Section II
18.       Weaving and braiding operations imply a material loss of about
5% in the case of yarn and 8% in the case of roving, referred to the weight
of yarn or roving packages feedstock.

ANNEX 4-8
ROMANIA
BUCHAREST GLASS FIBER PROJECT
ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACT AND PROTECTION
General
1.        The principal sources of pollution produced from the technology
employed in the project are the emission of fluorine and fluorides in the
exhaust gases from the furnaces and the discharge of process water. The
project will also produce solid waste in the form of glass fiber scraps,
which do, however, not involve difficult pollution problems as they are
substantially inert.
Air Emissions
2.        The main source of air pollution are the furnaces in which a large
amount (about 60x) of the fluorine added to the batch of raw materials as CaF2
decomposes during the melting process and is discharged to the atmosphere.
Most industrialized countries have very strict emission limits for fluorine
and its compounds as shown in Table 1. In particular in the case of similar
plants located in the proximity of populated areas or of buildings higher
than the maximum level of the plant, gaseous effluent treatment facilities
have been installed. Romanian standards for fluorine and fluoride emissions
are similar to USA and Western European regulations. For the Project, the
climatic conditions and its location in a flat non-residential area are such
that all suppliers guaranteed that the provision of a stack of suitable height
(25 to 30 m) will be sufficient to meet the Romanian standards. The Romanian
air pollution standards and the climatic conditions prevailing at the project
site are presented in Tables 2 and 3.
Waste Water
3.        Waste waters are primarily dilute fiber sizing material, and will,
after a single step biological treatment, followed by a chemical treatment
be discharged into the sewage system of the Municipality of Bucharest.
Waste water specifications for that system are quite similar to USA and
Western European specifications and are shown in Table 4. The Militari
industrial area has already the facilities necessary for pre-treatment
prior to discharge into the municipal system.
Solid Waste
4.        The project will produce about 2,500 tpy of waste glass fiber.
To date, no method for recycling has been developed, and the waste fiber
will, therefore, be dumped in a sanitary landfill of the municipality of
Bucharest. A research program is planned by the Research Institute for
the Glass and Ceramics Industry with the objective of finding some profit-
able application for these waste fibers.
