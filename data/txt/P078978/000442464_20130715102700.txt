F. Results Framework Analysis 3

Project Development Objectives (from Project Appraisal Document)
The objective was to increase access to, utilization of, and patient satisfaction with health
services in project-supported areas, and to build capacity and efficiency at national, oblast
and rayon levels in administering a basic package of health benefits and introducing
financing reforms in primary health care.

Revised Project Development Objectives (as approved by original approving
authority)

The Project Development Objectives were not revised.

  PDO (No.1-7) and IO (No.1-20) indicators are original CBHP indicators taken from the table
“Arrangements for results monitoring? in Annex 3 of the PAD as the complete set of indicators that had
actually been used at outset for project monitoring. Indicators listed in other parts of the PAD’s Annex 3
and Supplemental Letter No.2, including some additional ones, were not considered in this analysis because
they (i) did not have baseline and target values; (ii) in some cases, had different wording; (iii) in some cases,
combined more than one indicator from the “Arrangements for results monitoring? table; and (iv) had not
been used for actual project monitoring.

data is used as the baseline.

  This target value was set in AF1 Project Paper relative to the four visits specified as the baseline based on
the reported national average of 3.9 visits in 2008, which was higher than the average of 2.6 visits for the
six rural pilot rayons due to the incorporation of higher numbers of visits in urban areas. In subsequent
project documents, the target value remained unspecified up until it was set under AF2.

I. Disbursement Profile
1. Project Context, Development Objectives and Design

1.1 Context at Appraisal

1.       Country and Sector Background. In 2002-2005, Tajikistan’s first Poverty
Reduction Strategy (PRS) reflected the importance the government’s reform program
placed on improving health sector performance to advance overall health status and
achieve health outcomes outlined by the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs). After
the dissolution of the Soviet system, Tajikistan experienced years of civil war (1993-97),
which resulted in severe economic decline, leaving Tajikistan one of the poorest countries
in the world, with a social infrastructure, including the health system, in a near-state of
collapse. The breakdown of infrastructure and health services, particularly in rural areas,
led to resurgence in previously well managed communicable diseases: malaria has
become endemic in regions bordering Afghanistan and periodic outbreaks of typhoid
fever and measles attest to inadequacies of both the water supply system and public health
programs. Nearly one third of children suffered from chronic malnutrition and morbidity
and mortality rates of the main non-communicable diseases (NCD), such as hypertension
and ischemic heart disease, had increased as well. As a consequence, Tajikistan had the
poorest health outcomes among CIS countries and its epidemiological profile resembled
that of the lowest income countries in the world. 23

2.       Between 1999 and 2003, Tajikistan experienced a return to peace and stability,
which facilitated modest gains in wellbeing. Health spending was just under $12 per
capita in 2003, placing Tajikistan among the lowest spenders on health in the world. At
this level of spending the country had barely enough resources to cover the recurrent costs
of the most basic health services. 24 The public budget contributed just $2 per capita or 16
percent of the total. The government budget for the health sector represented less than one
percent of GDP in 2003. The health sector was characterized by poor health outcomes,
misallocation of staff and other resources, inefficient production of care, and hospital
overcapacities. The latter was aggravated by the input-based provider payment system, as
hospital beds were unequally distributed between urban and rural areas, resulting in
inequity of access. The lack of pooling of health funds had contributed to geographic
disparities and underfunding, which hampered the efficient use of resources and posed a
threat to access to care for low-income groups, particularly in rural areas. Financial
barriers were cited most often as a reason for not accessing health services, coupled with
physical barriers being most acute in the remote mountainous regions, especially during
the winter season. Years of under-financing left much of the existing infrastructure in a
state of disrepair and a large numbers of qualified health workers were lost to migration.

3.     Thus, the public health situation in Tajikistan was bleak and required an
immediate solution that would meet the short-term, urgent basic health care needs of the
population. The Government of Tajikistan (GOT) recognized that an immediate response
would need to be: (i) limited to the state budget; (ii) minimal in scope, focusing solely on

  Republic of Tajikistan. Health Sector Note (Report No.29858-TJ), June 30, 2005.
24
  The Commission on Macroeconomics and Health (2001) estimated that a minimal health service
package addressing the most common communicable diseases would cost around $34 in the least
developed countries.



                                               1
priorities such as basic maternal and child health (MCH) services and the prevention and
control of TB, HIV/AIDS, and malaria.

4.      At the same time, GOT developed a medium-term strategy that focused on: (i)
health financing reforms aiming at mobilizing resources to finance essential health
service; (ii) restructuring of the health delivery system to expand the primary health care
(PHC) network based on the family medicine (FM) model and strengthening the public
health functions; (iii) ensuring more effective service delivery for the poor through better
integration of public health, personal health care, and community health approaches; and
(iv) improving transparency and accountability at all levels by promoting participatory
monitoring and evaluation (M&E). 25

5.       Country Assistance Strategy and Rationale for Bank Assistance. The
government’s reform objectives were shared by the Bank’s strategy for Tajikistan, which
aimed to help “preserve and enhance the quality of health and education services?. 26 The
preceding Bank-financed Primary Health Care Project (PHCP), implemented in 2000-
2005, introduced a model of health care delivery based on primary care and enabled the
construction of 25 rural health facilities. The rationale for the Bank’s further involvement
in the health sector was grounded in: (i) the Ministry of Health’s (MOH) increasing
ability to manage the complex transition to sustainable development, its open recognition
of unresolved sector issues, commitment to complex policy and financing reforms; and
(ii) the Bank’s strong relationship with MOH, ability to continue coalition-building with
other donors, and its planned support to management and payment reforms in PHC
through a policy-based operation.

1.2 Original Project Development Objectives (PDO) and Key Indicators

6.      The PDOs were to: (i) increase access to, utilization of, and patient satisfaction
with health services in project-supported areas; and (ii) build capacity and efficiency at
the national, oblast and rayon levels in administering a basic package of health benefits
and introducing financing reforms in PHC. 27

7.        The PDOs were to be achieved through:

     (a) Strengthening coherence and coordination in policymaking, policy analysis, and the
         management of donor support by MOH;

     (b) The support to the implementation of per capita financing for PHC and the Basic
         Program of Medical Care Services (BPMCS); and

     (c) The renewal of the PHC infrastructure in 2-4 rayons in Soghd and Khatlon oblasts
         and complementary measures to improve service delivery and outreach.

No.32294-TJ), October 3, 2005.
27
   The wording of the PDO was the same in the main text and Annex 3 of the Project Appraisal
Document (PAD, Report No. 34080-TJ). Although it was slightly different in the Financing
Agreement, the difference in wording did not alter the substance.



                                                  2
8.      The achievement of the PDO was to be measured by the following outcome
indicators as identified in the main text of the PAD. 28

     (a) Decrease in percentage of households in project-supported areas who don’t seek
         health care when necessary because they cannot afford it;

     (b) Decrease in share of health costs as a percentage of total household expenditure in
         project areas;

     (c) More equitable distribution of the health budget through implementation of per
         capita financing in PHC and case-based payment for hospitals;

     (d) Improvement in PHC infrastructure, services, and patient satisfaction in project
         areas.

1.3 Revised PDO and Key Indicators

9.         The PDOs were not revised.

1.4 Main Beneficiaries

10.        Project investments were intended to benefit the following:

     a) MOH, oblast health departments (OHD) and rayon health and finance departments
        of the 41 rayons of the Soghd and Khatlon oblasts through strengthened capacity,
        coherence and coordination as well as through strengthened PHC and hospital
        management and financing, and capacity to implement the BPMCS;

     b) Front-line PHC workers in project-covered rayons through re-training under an
        approved FM training course;

     c) The populations of the Soghd and Khatlon oblasts (3.2 million people at appraisal)
        were to benefit from improved access to and utilization of PHC services in rural
        areas through rehabilitated PHC infrastructure and improved quality of basic
        services. Intended benefits also included improved financial protection through the
        expansion of the BPMCS, exemption of poor and vulnerable households from co-
        payments, and reduction of informal payments. Indirect benefits included reduced
        travel time for patients, and improved social welfare and productivity of the
        population. The communities were to be empowered to address their priority health
        needs through institutionalized community structures, capacity for prioritization and
        micro-planning, grant financing, and close dialogue with community nurses and
        feldshers.

1.5 Original Components

11.        The Project included the following four components:

12.     Component A. Strengthening Policy, Planning, and Donor Coordination in the
Ministry of Health (US$1.46 million or 10 percent of total project baseline cost) would
support four streams of activity:

13.     A1. Policy Formulation and Analysis sub-component included the establishment
of a Health Policy Analysis Unit (HPAU) under the MOH’s Department for Planning,
Coordination and Implementation of Health Reforms to perform analytical functions such
as: (i) monitoring and evaluation of health reforms through client satisfaction surveys,
public expenditure tracking (PETS) surveys, and out-of-pocket payment surveys; and (ii)
provision of evidence-based advice on policy development in response to MOH needs
through the preparation of National Health Accounts (NHA), functional and legislative
reviews of the health sector, and a basic sector Medium-Term Budget Framework
(MTBF).

14.    A2. Strategic and Operational Planning sub-component included the development
of a comprehensive sector strategy based on sub-sectoral strategies with the aim of
improving the coherence of sector policies and donor-financed activities.

15.     A3. Donor Coordination sub-component would help MOH improve donor
coordination through biannual sector review conferences aiming at collective policy
analysis, communication of policy objectives, joint planning, and, most importantly,
improving coordination between the government and international donors.

16.     A4. Public Relations and Communication sub-component included the
strengthening of the public relations capacity of the MOH by supporting: (i) the operation
of the earlier established Public Relations (PR) unit; (ii) ongoing PR activities and
communication programs connected with the MOH’s overall reform program; and (iii)
the development of a communication strategy for the MOH.

17.     Component B. Implementing Organizational and Financing Reforms in the
Health Sector (US$4.29 million or 29 percent of total project baseline cost) included
three subcomponents:

18.     B1. Strengthening PHC Management and Financing sub-component included: (i)
management training, furniture, and computers to build the capacity of the newly-formed
rayon PHC Departments in 41 rayons of the Soghd and Khatlon oblasts to manage the
network of facilities in their charge; (ii) development of a basic rayon-level PHC
management information system (MIS) for utilization tracking and basic disease
surveillance; (iii) an outreach vehicle for each rayon department for supervisory visits to
subordinate clinics in the rayon; and (iv) local TA for the OHDs to act as “PHC coaches?
following the Tendler and Freedheim model of Ceara, Brazil. 29 These project activities
were to build on and be complemented by a number of measures under the Policy-based
Credit designed to strengthen PHC management and financing and enable the effective
implementation of per capita-based budgeting for PHC including: (i) administrative
separation of PHC from hospitals at the rayon level; (ii) a treasury account for PHC at the
rayon level, separate from that of the Central Rayon Hospital (CRH); (iii) collection of all
PHC facilities—and their per capita based budgets—under the authority of a rayon-level

PHC department and manager in a network model; and (iv) adoption of per capita
budgeting for calculating and distributing rayon PHC budgets.

19.     B2. Strengthening Hospital Management and Implementing the Basic Program of
Medical Care Services sub-component included at the hospital level: (i) provision of
furniture, computer, and basic software for hospital accounting departments and training
for their new role as an active collector of fee revenues and case-based payments; (ii)
adaptation of the basic HMIS software package to serve billing and receiving functions;
and (iii) development of business plans that link revenue sources for the hospital with
their expected use. At the oblast level, (i) the introduction of a purchasing function in the
pilot OHDs by providing them with management training, computers as well as a server
and de novo developed software to receive and process hospitals’ payment claims; (ii)
local IT consultants to maintain servers and provide IT support; (iii) periodic and in-
service training of oblast staff in conjunction with counterparts in the MOH; and (iv)
local and international TA for continuous development and dissemination of information
on fees and patients’ rights, including the establishment of an oblast-level hotline for
complaints.

20.     B3. Strengthening MOH Oversight of Organizational and Financial Reforms sub-
component included the strengthening of hospital policy development in the Economic
and Financial Planning unit of the MOH by: (i) refining output-based budget formulation
methods, initially focusing on the refinement of the PHC per capita financing and on
costing and fine-tuning the BPMCS; (ii) applying an output-based budget formulation to
the development of the MTBF and the annual budget process; and (iii) monitoring health
financing indicators with the objective of developing baseline NHA.

21.    Component C. Strengthening Primary Health Care in Selected Rayons
(US$8.06 million or 55 percent of total project baseline cost) originally included the
following three subcomponents:

22.     C1. Strengthening the PHC Infrastructure sub-component envisaged (i) the
rehabilitation or replacement of PHC facilities in 2-4 rayons in Sughd and Khatlon oblasts
selected based on a PHC rationalization plan; (ii) furniture, equipment, and radio-
communication equipment for the facilities; (iii) and an engineer/architect and field
coordinators for supervision by the Project Implementation Unit (PIU). The
rehabilitation/construction works were to be based on revised building standards and
norms and standard design packages for rural health facilities.

23.     C2. Strengthening PHC Services and Outreach sub-component (financed in
parallel by the Swedish International Development Agency (SIDA)) was designed to
support (i) a technically-guided dialogue process between health workers and
communities to identify service bottlenecks and plan solutions, which would
progressively be supported by staff from the rayon PHC department in order to build
supervision capacity on their part; and (ii) a small grants program to address the issues in
question, explicitly considering issues of child and maternal mortality and access to
pharmaceuticals. Examples of such activities included inter alia the following:
establishing or using an existing institutional structure for consultation and action on
health issues at the village level; designing a program of targeted interventions for
vulnerable groups and priority health issues; developing proposals for remedial actions
that can be financed with small grants of less than US$500, etc.




                                             5
24.   C3. Strengthening PHC Training sub-component included re-training of, at a
minimum, all PHC workers in project rayons under an approved family medicine training
scheme.

25.     Component D. Project Coordination and Capacity Building for Implementation
(USS0.62 million or 4 percent of total project baseline cost) 30 included project
management by the PIU to support the MOH in the administration and coordination of the
project. Field supervisors were to be hired as local consultants to oversee civil works. As
opposed to the previous project, component specialists in this project were to be co-
located with their counterparts in the MOH. The PIU was also, over time, to be located
within the Ministry, both to ensure close coordination and to facilitate capacity
development for project implementation and fiduciary functions in the MOH itself.

1.6 Revised Components

26.     See section 1.7 on changes to the components in terms of their scope and scale.

1.7 Other significant changes

27.     Changes to the project included: three occasions of additional financing (AF), two
cases of restructuring, reallocations of funds on two occasions, one extension of closing
date, and a cancellation of funds.

Additional Financing

28.     The US$4 million of AF from the Global Food Crisis Response Trust Fund
(GFPCR TF092349) was an emergency response to the combined impact of the harsh
winter of 2007-2008 coupled with power shortages and high energy prices, and a
resulting severe financial and food crisis. 31 It entailed the addition of 3 subcomponents to
Component C of the CBHP and 7 new Intermediate Outcome (IO) indicators to the
Results Framework (RF) to monitor the progress under those subcomponents.32

29.     The US$5 million equivalent AF1 (IDA-H4610; hereinafter, AF1) 33 supported: (i)
the financing gap under the CBHP related to the overall price inflation due to the
financial crisis; and (ii) the scaling up of the CBHP activities, as detailed in Annex 10.
The RF was updated with 7 new IO indicators specific to the AF1-supported activities,
two new PDO indicators, and a modification of one original PDO indicator.




30
   The Project Preparation Advance of US$300,000 accounted for the remaining 2 percent of the total
baseline cost.
31
   Approved by the Board on June 13, 2008; the Grant Agreement was signed and became effective on
July 17, 2008, with the closing date of March 31, 2010
32
   The subcomponents supported: C3) nutritional supplements and nutrition education to pregnant and
lactating women; C4) growth monitoring equipment for primary health care centers; and C5) food
packages for undernourished women at PHC centers. The closing date under the Grant Agreement
dated July 17, 2008 was March 31, 2010.
33
   Approved by the Board on April 30, 2009; the Financing Agreement was signed on May 22, 2009
and declared effective on August 11, 2009, with the closing date of December 31, 2010.



                                                 6
30.   The US$3 million equivalent AF2 (IDA-H5860; hereinafter, AF2) 34 scaled up the
CBHP and AF1 activities, as detailed in Annex 10.

Reallocation

31.     The first reallocation of the original Grant proceeds in the amount of SDR
116,000 (US$180,000 equivalent) from “Unallocated? to “Operating Costs? category35
was due to: (i) initially underestimated operating costs, which were exacerbated by
inflation in overall costs in conjunction with the then ongoing economic crisis; and (ii)
increased burden on operational costs related to the PIU’s parallel administration of the
GFPCR AF and preparation of the new Health Sector Strategy Support Project.

32.    The second reallocation 36 permitted the unallocated SDR 404,000 and Project
Preparation Advance (PPA) savings of SDR 42,627 to be reallocated to the “Works,
Goods and Consultants’ Services? and “Operational Costs? categories in order to reflect
funding needs by category more accurately and to utilize project savings in the PPA
category (see Annex 1, Table d).

Restructuring

33.     The first (Level I) restructuring for the undisbursed portion of the original project
included: (i) an upgrade of the Environmental Category from C to B (see Section 2.4);
and (ii) an extension of the CBHP closing date from March 31, 2010 to December 31,
2010 to align it with the closing date of the AF1 to allow for the preparation of the
Implementation Completion and Results (ICR) Report for both. 37

34.     The second (Level II) restructuring involved only the reallocation of funds as
detailed above and in Annex 1, Table d.

Cancellation

35.     SDR548 from the AF1 was cancelled as of April 30, 2011 as undisbursed balance
at closing, which originated due to the exchange rate fluctuations and ensuing currency
gain, with the disbursement under the AF1 at closing amounting to US$5.19 million
equivalent.

2. Key Factors Affecting Implementation and Outcomes

2.1 Project Preparation, Design and Quality at Entry

36.   The ICR team rates Project Preparation, Design and Quality at Entry as
Moderately Satisfactory on the basis of the following factors:


34
   Approved by the Board on July 1, 2010; the Financing Agreement was signed on August 5, 2010 and
declared effective on November 3, 2010, with the closing date of December 31, 2012.

   Processed on October 30, 2008 through the Country Director’s approval in response to the request
from the Ministry of Finance dated October 16, 2008.
36
   Processed on August 30, 2010 through the Country Director’s approval in response to the request
from the Ministry of Finance dated August 6, 2010.
37
   Processed on April 30, 2009 along with the AF1 through the Board approval following the Bank-
wide HNP portfolio review.



                                                7
37.      Project Preparation. The project was prepared within a period of 10 months and
under tight budget constraints: a sizeable portion of the budget was spent on the
preparation and dissemination of the Tajikistan Health Sector Note, Report No.29858-
TJ. 38 Project preparation was supported by a Japanese Trust Fund 39 for: (i) baseline
surveys and stakeholder assessment; (ii) rationalization and investment plans for rayon
health systems in selected rayons; (iii) action plan for community-based health promotion
and public health programs; (iv) operationalization of community health grant program;
(v) Project Implementation Plan and Operational Manual; (vi) Technical Norm; and (vii)
Standard Design Packages.

38.     Apart from the PHRD Grant, the GOT requested a PPA 40 in order to: (i)
implement additional activities for the CBHP preparation—such as the development of a
PHC rationalization plan in two oblasts and a training plan to support community-based
health promotion, public health programs, and the small grants program; and (ii) provide
operational costs and capacity building for the implementation of the PHRD Grant and
during the estimated 9-month period between the closing of the PHCP and effectiveness
of the CBHP.

39.     The entire project was financed by a total of 6 grants. The original IDA grant of
US$10 million equivalent, in the form of Specific Investment Lending (SIL), was co-
financed by two grants from SIDA and SDC (US$6 million and US$1.2 million
equivalent, respectively), with SDC funds earmarked to subcomponents A3 and C3. The
project also received three IDA grants as AF in 2008, 2009, and 2010 (US$4 million,
US$5 million equivalent, and US$3 million equivalent, respectively). The first five grants
were fully disbursed at closing in 2010, with only SDR548 from AF1 cancelled as
undisbursed currency gain (see Section 1.7).

40.    Quality at Entry. The project’s quality at entry was Moderately Satisfactory
based on the following:

41.      Soundness of background analysis. An extensive analysis of the issues affecting
access to, utilization, and quality of health care services, as well as the overall
performance of the health system was summarized in the Tajikistan Health Sector Note.
The report also provided policy recommendations for short- and medium-to-long-term
strategies to address both immediate needs and systemic reforms. The preparation also
benefitted from analytical work identifying macro issues and implications for the project
design, such as Tajikistan Poverty Assessments, 2000, 2004 and Public Expenditure and
Institutional Review, 2004.

   Letter from the Ministry of Finance dated November 30, 2004. The PPA (IDA-Q4680) was signed
on March 25, 2005, with the original closing date of June 30, 2005, which was extended once until
March 31, 2006 due to the change in the original timetable for the CBHP preparation. A reallocation of
US$35,000 was processed on January 26, 2006 from Category 2 (Consultant Services) to Category 4
(Operating Costs). Of the total amount of US$300,000, US$240,275 was disbursed; the remaining
amount was reallocated to other categories (see Annex 1, Table d).

42.     Quality Enhancement Review (QER). A QER was conducted prior to project
appraisal. The project was found to be soundly designed with an adequate balance of
ambitiousness and risk. It was also considered to be appropriate to the context, with the
recognition that implementation would be challenging given the institutional reforms to
be supported. The need for close attention to coordination both within the government,
between the levels of government, and with other donors was emphasized. Specification
of M&E arrangements in greater detail was also recommended. Most recommendations
by the QER were taken into account and reflected in the revised PAD.

43.     Assessment of Project Design. The overall objective of the project was consistent
with the identified sector issues, PRS, National Development Strategy (NDS), the
Concept of Health Reform in Tajikistan for 2002-2010, and the Bank’s country strategy. 41
The project components, as designed, did comprehensively address the key needs of the
country’s health sector at all levels, including the focus on the renewal of PHC
infrastructure combined with improvements in service delivery, community outreach, and
health worker training. The project built on prior rigorous analytical work and lessons
from the preceding Bank-financed PHCP. It envisaged a phased approach to reforms and
the “learning-by-doing? modality for the MOH’s capacity building and coordination. The
design also safeguarded policy reforms under the ongoing Bank budget support through a
Letter of Development Policy (LDP) and leveraged the complementarities with other
development partners’ (DP) previous and ongoing work, e.g., the ZdravPlus-developed
hospital MIS. Although stakeholder views regarding the level of the project’s
ambitiousness varied, all unanimously acknowledged the project to be the most
comprehensive health sector operation in Tajikistan to date.

44.     At the same time, the design was challenging due to the lack of institutional
capacity; multitude of partners and stakeholders involved; variety of funding sources and
arrangements; and the intertwinement of the project activities with each other and their
dependence on policy measures by the GOT. In fact, the retention of the experienced
PHCP PIU for implementation of the CBHP and management of the civil works was
designed to compensate for the initial capacity constraints. However, the expectation for
timely and consistent government actions for the implementation of the project as planned
proved optimistic, especially given the unforeseen global economic crisis impacts.

45.     Several project design alternatives were considered. 42 The option of a policy-
based operation was rejected in view of Tajikistan’s substantial investment needs. An
immediate move to a SWAp arrangement was also rejected at appraisal because of the
overall weak administrative capacity of the MOH, as well as a lack of donor coordination
and the absence of a widely agreed upon health sector strategy. 43 An exclusive focus on
service delivery at the grassroots level was rejected for many reasons: (i) failure of the
many existing targeted grassroots interventions to collectively translate into improved
performance of the public health sector; (ii) incentive problems and structural failings in
the public delivery system itself; (iii) the inability of disease-focused interventions to

43
   This was fully consistent with the then new Country Partnership Strategy for FY06-09, in which a
follow-on project to be implemented through a SWAp arrangement was included for 2009.

address the significant inequalities in the burden of health financing and out-of-pocket
payments; and (iv) the need for a combination of technical expertise and investments to
support the GOT’s ambitious structural reform program, an area in which the Bank has
considerable comparative advantage and, thus, demand.

46.     Lessons learned from previous Bank-financed projects. The project design
incorporated several key lessons drawn from the implementation of other health reform
projects in the ECA Region, which included the following:

     •   Clear recognition of the political and technical complexity of rationalizing health
         facilities, especially hospitals, without changes in the provider payment system in
         a post-conflict country with high poverty, very weak infrastructure, and
         geographical challenges.
     •   The complexity of supervising remote civil works to be completed on time and at
         a reasonable cost and, thus, the importance of outreach and closer coordination
         with local communities to build ownership and support as well as very close
         planning and supervision of the process at both the national and local levels.
     •   The need for policy-based lending to complement project activities and support
         institutional reforms, and “anchoring? activities in the country’s policy or
         program context to ensure sustainability.

47.     Risk Assessment. A comprehensive list of risks to PDOs and component results
was included in the PAD. The mitigation measures were adequately identified for most of
the risks. Still, some risks were either unforeseen or the envisaged mitigation measures
turned out to be insufficiently adequate or beyond the project’s control. Thus, the
potentially insufficient allocations to the health sector and implementation feasibility and
sequencing of key blocks of the Health Sector Financing Strategy (HSFS) 2005-201544
were underestimated, as were some critical risks for the implementation of Component B.
For example, the only risk identified for Component B was the failure of BPMCS to
reduce informal payments because of failure to implement payment reforms—mitigation
measures were defined as the provision of management training for BPMCS
implementation, PR strategy implementation, and the creation of opportunities for redress.
Moreover, the feasibility of scaling up hospital case-based payment and PHC financing
reforms in the context of persisting input-based, fragmented financing system were not
fully evaluated at the design stage. The materialized risks led inter alia to the financial
inadequacy of the BBP, introduction of hospital fee-for-services system, and a much
slower pace of financing reforms than intended.

48.     Adequacy of participatory processes. The preparation benefitted from close
collaboration with a wide range of DPs and projects involved in the Tajikistan health
sector, including SIDA, the Swiss Development Cooperation (SDC), the United States
Agency for International Development (USAID)-funded ZdravPlus Project (subsequently,
Quality Health Care Project-QHCP), SDC-funded Project Sino, the World Health
Organization (WHO), Asian Development Bank (ADB), UN Emergency Fund for




44
  The Strategy included the following key blocks: establishment of a single payer, pooling of public
funds at the oblast level, development and implementation of new provider payment methods,
increased public financing, output-based budget formulation, and reorganization of health care delivery
system.



                                                  10
Children (UNICEF), Aga Khan Foundation, and a number of local NGOs. 45 The
collaboration ranged from direct participation in the project design to close coordination
in areas of common interest, including the use of management training curricula
developed by ZdravPlus Project, and HMIS work done by ADB, ZdravPlus, WHO, and
Project Sino.

49.     Adequacy of government commitment: (i) in accordance with the PRS, the GOT
adopted in May 2005 the HSFS for 2005-2015, which provided an important framework
for the implementation of health financing reforms in the medium term; (ii) the MOH
confirmed its commitment to the key structural, institutional and health financing reforms
supported by the project in the LDP; 46 (iii) key stakeholders were involved in project
preparation from the outset, such as the National Board on Health under the Prime-
Minister Office and the Aid Coordination Unit in the President’s Administration; and (iv)
the well-established and experienced PIU from the previous Bank-financed PHC project
was retained for the implementation of the CBHP.

2.2 Implementation

50.     The project succeeded in delivering nearly all of the outputs under the four
components and the Food Price Crisis AF (refer to Annex 2). The project was rated
Satisfactory throughout, in terms of both Development Objective (DO) and
Implementation Progress (IP), with DO downgraded to Moderately Satisfactory only
twice. The first was in December 2010 due to the lack of clear and consistent data on
progress towards the PDO, and the second in December 2012 as an overall DO rating for
the project because some PDO indicators were only partially achieved. IP was
consistently rated Highly Satisfactory from June 2009 to May 2010, and Moderately
Satisfactory only once in May 2012 due to a disbursement delay. The project was never
considered at risk during its implementation period and performed well both at the central,
oblast, and rayon levels despite challenges presented by a complex policy environment
and the adverse impacts of the economic crisis.

Positive factors in implementation

51.     Strong GOT ownership during the early implementation period was reflected in
a number of consistent and decisive GOT actions, including, inter alia, the adoption in
February 2006 of an Action Plan for the implementation of the HSFS; and the
establishment of 19 working groups early in the process for the development of the
envisaged sub-strategies, including a working group to develop a communication strategy
chaired by an MOH deputy minister.

52.     The Bank-supported programmatic development policy grants (PDPG)
reinforced project investments in infrastructure, capacity building, and in establishing
systems and processes; most importantly, they highlighted the sector needs to the GOT.
Thus, the legal framework for the strengthening of PHC management and financing—as
contemplated in the PAD—was adopted under PDPG-1. 47 Likewise, the allocation of a

greater share of health sector wage bill increases to PHC workers’ wages was
implemented between 2006 and 2008 under PDPG1-3. These policy actions helped shift
financial and human resource allocations towards the strengthened, PHC-centered health
care delivery model.

53.     The Bank’s continuous focus on sustainability of investments and flexibility in
adjusting the project scope based on emerging issues and needs. For example, the Food
Price Crisis AF of 2008 addressed the impact of sharply rising food prices on the
nutritional status of pregnant and breastfeeding women and children in the Soghd and
Khatlon oblasts. Likewise, the increase in construction costs by 87% between 2006 and
2008 due to hikes in wages, operational costs, and construction material prices
necessitated the provision of the AF1 in 2009 to enable the completion of the originally
planned activities and maximize the project’s development impact. 48

54.     Effective administration of the project by the PIU was acknowledged in all the
aide memoires and consistently rated Satisfactory or Highly Satisfactory. Despite the
replacement of the PIU Director in early 2011, the PIU’s accumulated project
management experience secured efficient and timely completion of the project activities
that were within its control.

Less effective factors influencing implementation

55.     Overall fiscal limitations resulted in considerable, chronic underfunding of the
health sector and impeded implementation of BPMCS and PHC financing reforms.
During project implementation, public funding for the health sector increased from 1.3%
of GDP in 2006 to 2.0% in 2011, 49 with most of the funding supplementing health
workers’ salaries. While additional public financing for non-salary expenditures was
considered critical for moving towards full capitation in PHC and effective financing of
the BPMCS, its lack—aggravated by the economic crisis—proved detrimental to
increasing access to health services for the poorest. For example, the national average for
the percentage of households who did not seek health care when necessary because they
could not afford it rose from 26.7% in 2003 to 53% in 2009.

56.      Considerable capacity constraints in the sector both at the central level and
among oblast, rayon and facility administrators. For example, the MOH’s nascent
institutional capacity in health policy, planning and management was heavily restrained
initially by the lack of a coherent national health strategy unifying the key stakeholders
around a shared sector vision and objectives. This limited the MOH’s ability to avoid
fragmentation among DPs and to improve MOF’s understanding of the complex
functioning of the health sector in order to gain its support to a consistent and shared
reform path. 50

57.     Disagreement on health financing reforms between the MOH and MOF after
2009 proved to be the stumbling block for scaling up the reforms. The MOF was
concerned about: (i) the lack of a comprehensive, clear vision and implementation
capacity for the reforms on the MOH side, including the clarity on how the reforms would

50
   This view was shared by the Vertical Functional Review of the Ministry of Health and in most of the
interviews the ICR team conducted.



                                                 12
lead to improved quality and efficiency of health services; 51 and (ii) the MOH’s limited
public finance management capacity to prevent potential financial misuses in the sector
while moving away from the traditional line-item budgeting. Thus, in the absence of
progress in pooling of funds at the oblast level and further scaling up of case-based
payment system, the project activities focused mainly on development of hospital
business plans, health staff capacity building, and information campaigns on the
population’s rights under the BPMCS.

58.     While policy dialogue on financing and organizational reform issues had
increasingly become a multi-donor affair, 52, this uncertainty in policy environment called
for a consistent dialogue and capacity building effort from DPs, involving not only the
MOH but, importantly, also the MOF. Regrettably, the lack of shared approach to
substantive aspects of reforms (PHC capitation, funds pooling, and FM and CME
training) among DPs themselves at different stages of project implementation fell short of
building a shared vision and consensus within the GOT. This was exacerbated by the lack
of a convening power to lead the policy dialogue on implementation of structural reforms
with the GOT at the highest level (which most of the interviewed stakeholders saw as the
World Bank’s mandate). The Bank’s implementation-focused engagement in this area
remained somewhat insufficient, with PDPGs focusing on adoption of policy measures,
and CBHP mostly on capacity building activities and service delivery. All these factors
collectively resulted in the absence of a critical mass supporting health financing reforms
and made them nearly an impossible undertaking.


2.3 Monitoring and Evaluation (M&E) Design, Implementation and Utilization
Rating: Modest

59.     M&E Design is rated Modest. The design of the M&E system had the following
weaknesses: (i) an extensive number of PDO and IO indicators (14 and 20, respectively,
listed collectively in the PAD and Supplemental Letter No.2); 53 (ii) missing baseline and
target values for half of the proposed PDO indicators, especially those measuring
improvements in service delivery and patient satisfaction; (iii) reliance of the two main
PDO indicators on the Tajikistan Living Standards Survey (TLSS) conducted outside of
the project scope, with their baseline and target values specified for the national level
while the project investments only covered selected rayons in two oblasts; (iv) complexity
and process orientation (number of rayons covered or staff trained) of some indicators,
including for PDO; (v) inclusion of indicators that did not directly and solely reflect the
project activities, e.g., PDO indicator “More equitable distribution of the health budget
through implementation of per capita financing in PHC and case-based payment for
hospitals? although hospital payment reform was supported by ZdravPlus. For these
reasons, the project monitoring presented challenges throughout the implementation
period, especially due to the lack of updated, accurate, and comparable data for the two

No.32294-TJ), October 3, 2005.
53
   The Supplemental Letter No.2 did not include all the indicators listed in the PAD, and the wording
of some indicators differed between the two documents. The reasons for using the indicators from the
“Arrangements for results monitoring? table of the PAD’s Annex 3 for Results Framework Analysis
are explained in Section F of the Data Sheet.



                                                  13
key PDO indicators. 54 This manifested itself especially after 2009 when the TLSS was
discontinued.

60.     M&E Implementation is rated Modest. Despite inconsistencies in the RF, the
level of effort to monitor progress towards PDO achievement was commendable. From
the outset, special attention was paid by the Bank to establish a baseline for and measure
the impact of health financing reforms. Thus, the baseline Patient Financial Burden and
Satisfaction survey was made the priority task for the forthcoming HPAU.

61.     An informal revision of the RF took place in May 2009 in order to improve clarity,
relevance, and measurability of both PDO and IO indicators. As a result, monitoring of 12
PDO and 14 IO indicators was discontinued, a few new indicators added, and others were
refined. The M&E of the project was downgraded from Satisfactory to Moderately
Satisfactory only once in December 2010 given the lack of clear and consistent data on
progress towards the PDO, especially for the two indicators relying on TLSS data. A
revision of the overall M&E framework was attempted to ensure the indicators could be
monitored regularly for the remaining two years of the AF2 implementation, 55 which
would have required processing of a Level II restructuring of the project. This intention
was later reconsidered in consultation with the Bank’s ECA Quality department as the
two main PDO indicators were considered achieved based on the original CBHP target
values whereas it appears to have been confused that the (more optimistic) target values
for the two PDO indicators set under AF2 56 overrode the original CBHP target values.
Regrettably, this confusion had eliminated the last opportunity for correcting deficiencies
in the project M&E.

62.      M&E Utilization is rated Substantial. The MOH’s capacity to use the produced
data for policy planning and decision making has evolved over time, though at a slower
pace than expected. Following the period of continuous overwhelming of the HPAU with
the MOH’s routine work—which left less time for HPAU’s core analytical and M&E
functions—remarkable progress was achieved in building demand from policymakers and
other stakeholders for relevant and timely analytical inputs. Thus, the European
Commission (EC) and WHO continued to support HPAU functioning after CBHP phased
out, and the practice of having clear annual work plans for HPAU, allocating 80% of its
time to analytical work, has been gradually followed. Moreover, the continuous use of
surveys, NHA, and MTBF was embedded in the Comprehensive Health Care Strategy,
which also includes a comprehensive set of monitoring indicators for implementation
review and policy planning through the participatory Joint Annual Review conferences
initiated since 2011 under MOH leadership.

63.    Notably, the State Committee for Investments and State Property Management
(SCISPM) has committed to increasingly linking sectoral monitoring data with strategic
monitoring and planning at the national level through a comprehensive database of all
donor investment projects in the country and enhancement of sectoral indicators to ensure
the impact, sustainability, and consistency of all investments with national priorities.

   Targets for these two indicators were established under AF2 at or below the already attained, pre-
crisis levels based on TLSS 2007 data. The unavailability at the time of AF2 processing of the TLSS
2009 data, which was already reflective of the impact of the economic crisis, resulted in the inability of
the Bank team to establish realistic target values for these two indicators.



                                                   14
64.      The project investments in PHC- and hospital-based MIS and enhancing health
statistics quality have contributed to improving the accuracy and reliability of data for
monitoring, planning, and decision making purposes. The EC plans to further develop
HMIS at the national level, with potential use of the CBHP-deployed facility-based MIS,
present considerable room for system-wide improvements in the M&E capacity in
Tajikistan.

2.4 Safeguard and Fiduciary Compliance

65.     Safeguards compliance is rated Moderately Satisfactory. The original Project
was rated C and was limited to the rehabilitation of small PHC facilities (1-5 rooms), with
potential replacement of a few facilities within the existing building footprint. 57 These
were expected to pose minimal environmental risks. With no outpatient surgery or other
procedures, no medical wastes were envisaged and safe disposal of “sharps? was to be
specified, and no land acquisition was expected. Nonetheless, with a potential
replacement of health facilities, the Recipient, though not required for a Category C
project, had prepared, approved, and publicly disclosed in November 2005 an
Environmental Management Plan (EMP). The Plan covered issues pertinent to small-
scale civil works and, according to the then existing national Sanitary Norms and Rules,
envisaged a site-specific environmental screening and review process. 58

66.      As part of the Bank-wide portfolio review of investment projects conducted in
December 2008, the Bank team found that out of the 55 planned facilities, 11 were being
built on new sites, with the construction half way completed. The Bank team ensured all
necessary due diligence by: (i) requesting the Recipient to immediately suspend all the
construction works on those sites; (ii) exploring the reasons of the need for construction
on new sites; and (iii) consulting with the Bank’s safeguards unit. It was found that: (i)
the 11 new PHC facilities had to be constructed on new sites because the rented premises
of other facilities (schools, utility rooms, etc.) where the old PHC centers were located
had to be vacated; (ii) they were constructed on new sites previously approved by the
local authorities in strict compliance with the Oblast Development Master Plans,
environmental evaluation, and the country’s legislation; (iii) the new construction was on
territories that had not been populated before, were free of settlement, greenery, buildings
or any economic activity, and nobody had lived before on those territories; and (iv) no
resettlement took place according to the local authorities; (v) the land for new
construction sites was appropriately allocated based on four commonly required legal
documents. 59 In addition, an independent social assessment commissioned by the Bank on
the due diligence of land acquisition for the 11 PHC centers confirmed that no land
acquisition or involuntary resettlement took place, thus, the Bank’s Operational Policy
4.12 on involuntary resettlement was not triggered.

67.     As a result of the findings and a review by the Bank’s Safeguards Unit of the
original EMP—which was found acceptable—the following actions were taken by the
Bank: (i) the Environmental Category was upgraded from C to B, along with processing
the AF1, in March 2009 for the undisbursed CBHP funds pertaining to the construction of

                                               15
the 11 PHC centers; (ii) site-specific EMP checklists for the 11 PHC facilities were
prepared by the PIU/MOH in accordance with the original Project-wide EMP, approved
by the Bank, and included in civil works contracts before the continuation of construction
works; (iii) the AF1 was assigned Environmental Category B, and the original EMP was
updated by the MOH in line with Bank requirements for Category B projects and publicly
disclosed in March 2009. 60Subsequently, the Bank team continued to ensure compliance
of the civil works with the provisions of the project-wide and site-specific EMPs. As a
result, the project did not have significant or irreversible negative environmental impact
at the construction phase of the facilities.

68.     Although the handling and processing medical waste was the responsibility of the
rayon SES, the Bank recommended on several occasions to: (i) revisit the utilized
incinerator design to ensure destruction of all medical waste items; and (ii) assess
functional efficiency of the medical waste collection and processing system in order to
minimize possible health hazards. By November 2012, this issue was addressed through a
MOH decision to build a new type of small incinerator based on improved and tested
design, and with all technical work being underway.

69. Financial Management is rated Satisfactory. The PIU had adequate capacity
throughout the project period and performed all financial management functions as
required. Additional internal controls were implemented by the PIU for the Food Price
Crisis AF, as required by the Bank, to ensure transparency and control over the selection
of beneficiaries and implementing NGOs, as well as the delivery and distribution of food
and nutrition supplements. The internal controls were further strengthened in 2010 to
eliminate the practice of cash payments for training expenditures. The customized
accounting software was updated as necessary in order to produce acceptable financial
reporting for all the grants. Disbursements under the project were consistently on or ahead
of schedule and the proceeds of the grants were disbursed as planned.

70.     Although external audit reports were usually submitted in a timely manner and
found acceptable by the Bank, the reports for CY2010 and CY2011 were delayed due to
the late selection of an auditor by the SCISPM under the centralized annual block audit
arrangement. As part of the project closing procedures, the PIU opened an escrow
account for the payment of the final audit to be conducted in May 2013, with a report
expected by June 30, 2013.

71.     Procurement is rated Satisfactory. The PIU had adequate procurement capacity
and procurement activities were implemented satisfactorily for the most implementation
period based on a regularly updated procurement plan. The detailed Project Operational
Manual ensured clarity of roles among PIU staff vis-à-vis procurement activities, and the
availability of procurement staff in the Bank’s country office enabled regular interaction
on procurement issues.

72.     Initial delays in the first round of the micronutrients and food packages
procurement under the Food Price Crisis AF occurred due to the increase in procurement
workload and lack of technical expertise in the PIU in procurement planning for
emergency assistance. The issue was addressed through: (i) the recruitment of an
additional procurement assistant to support the implementation of the Food Price Crisis


60
     Ibid.



                                            16
AF; (ii) collaboration with UNICEF in procurement planning and supply of
micronutrients, vitamins, and growth monitoring equipment; and (iii) application of the
simplified shopping method with higher thresholds for the procurement of the first batch
of food packages. The latter was allowed by the Bank in response to the urgent nature of
the food crisis, based on OP/BP 8.00. At the same time, the PIU was required to develop
a satisfactory distribution plan and oversight mechanism to ensure timely delivery of the
food packages to the beneficiaries.

73.     The recommendations from the four procurement ex-post reviews and a country
fiduciary portfolio review (2008) conducted for the project were usually properly
implemented by the PIU before the next mission. No major issues were identified during
the reviews, with procurement processes considered compliant with the Bank’s
procurement guidelines.

2.5 Post-completion Operation/Next Phase

74.     The transition arrangements for post-completion of CBHP investments are
considered adequate, as demonstrated by: (i) the takeover of CBHP support to some
MOH functions by other partners (e.g., by WHO and EC for HPAU; by USAID-funded
QHCP for the MOH Press Center); (ii) incorporation of some other functions into MOH
routine operation (e.g., donor coordination); and (iii) shared funding from oblast and
rayon hukumats for FM training and maintenance of PHC infrastructure, and from local
jamoats for operational costs of PHC facilities (e.g., fuel for generators). Also, the
dialogue has continued with GOT on implementing the Health Sector Master Plan.

75.     A proposed Health Services Improvement Project (HSIP) planned for early
FY14 would focus on improving the coverage and quality of basic PHC services (mainly
for MCH and NCD) by piloting performance-based financing (PBF) at the PHC level as
well as continued investments in PHC infrastructure and capacity building. The HSIP also
marks important transitions: to an explicit focus at the policy level on stimulating
improvements in service quality, and from the PIU-based model to MOH-led
implementation. In addition, an Institutional Development Fund (IDF) grant 61 will
support the piloting of full per capita financing in PHC facilities of selected rayons in the
country.

3. Assessment of Outcomes

3.1 Relevance of Objectives, Design and Implementation
Rating: Substantial

76.      Objectives. The project’s objectives were, and remain, highly relevant. They fully
reflect the country’s current development priorities declared in the NDS for 2006-2015,
PRS for 2010-2012, and Comprehensive Health Sector Strategy 2010-2020. 62 The
objectives are also consistent with the Bank’s Country Partnership Strategy for FY2010-



61
  Approved in December 2012 in the amount of US$0.5 million.
62
  The priorities specified in these strategies relate to improving public administration and developing
human potential; promoting sustainable improvements in living standards, particularly of vulnerable
groups; and improving quality, equity, efficiency and cost-effectiveness of the health system through
inter alia an increase in public funding, in particular to primary health care.



                                                   17
13 aiming to maintain access to critical public services and to strengthen the quality of
public services provided in order to enhance human capital potential.

77.      Design. The design was, and remains, substantially relevant. Project components
built on the previous project’s lessons and comprehensively addressed the key sector
issues that retained their relevance throughout. The combination of investments in
physical infrastructure and intellectual capacity, and reinforcement of investment
activities with policy-based budget support remained relevant and effective design
features. However, a better defined and streamlined RF could have enabled better
measurement and demonstration of the PDO achievement.

78.     Implementation arrangements based on a PIU model were relevant in the context
of the existing weak institutional capacity in the health sector. However, the arrangements
for gradually mainstreaming the stand-alone PIU into the MOH did not materialize fully
in practice and, therefore, considered modest.

3.2 Achievement of Project Development Objectives
Rating: Substantial

79.     Overall, compared to the situation prior to CBHP, the project, with co-financing
from SIDA and SDC, made an important contribution to improvements in some key areas,
including (i) the strengthening of the MOH’s stewardship capacity; (ii) building capacity
for delivering PHC services and implementing structural reforms at all levels; and (iii)
improving access to, utilization of and patient satisfaction with PHC services in project-
supported rayons.

80.     As illustrated in Table 1 below, the targets for nearly all the IO indicators were
achieved or partially achieved, as were most of the PDO indicators (refer to Annex 2 and
Section F of the Data Sheet for details). However, two PDO indicators—related to the
percentage of households not seeking care because they cannot afford it and the share of
health in household expenditures—presented a mixed picture vis-à-vis achievement of the
PDO1.

PDO 1 – increase access to, utilization of, and patient satisfaction with health services
in project-supported areas.

81.      The strengthening of the PHC infrastructure, FM-based services, and outreach;
involvement of local communities; and implementation of the BPMCS has led to
increased utilization of health services in the pilot rayons. Although the changes have
been uneven, the evidence shows that the number of PHC visits per capita per year in the
7 pilot rayons has increased by over 70% on average in 2012 compared to 2009, and over
60% compared to 2006. The PHC gate-keeping function established through a referral
system and the BPMCS implementation have resulted in improved access to hospital
services and financial protection of vulnerable and exempted population groups in the
BPMCS pilot rayons. While the share of hospital admissions of provisionally exempted
groups before the BPMCS implementation was around 30% on average, this share ranged
in 2011 between 43.7% in Sarband, 55.6% in Spitamen, and 65.2% in Nurek.
Furthermore, deliveries have increasingly constituted the largest share of all the
admissions of exempted groups under the BPMCS, which ranged in 2011 from 47.9% in
Spitamen to 61.4% in Nurek to 64.9% in Sarband.64 The findings from the final Patient
Financial Burden and Satisfaction survey conducted in late 2009, after 15 months of the
BPMCS implementation, suggest that the share of pregnant women registering with PHC
facilities in order to benefit from free delivery under the BPMCS increased from 6.8% to
15% of all PHC visits. The survey also confirmed that—when formalized co-payments,
informal payments to medical personnel, and payments for drugs, medical supplies and
lab tests were taken into account—the average amount of payment by patients decreased
by 11% in the pilot rayons whereas it increased by 21% in the control rayons.

82.      The increased utilization of health services in the pilot rayons has translated into
improved health system performance indicators: (i) increase in the number of pregnant
women seeking antenatal care from the baseline of zero in 2005 to 2,889 in 2009 and to
4,229 in 2012; (ii) 37% reduction in home deliveries from 35,063 in 2005 to 21,954 in
2012; and (iii) some improvements in immunization coverage and infant and child
mortality rates 65. Evidence also indicates to increased satisfaction with health services in
project supported areas. According to data from the same survey of 2009, the level of
satisfaction with PHC services was 92%, and 93% for hospital services. The CBHP
Impact Assessment of 2010 66 explained behavioral reasons for such unusually high values
but also confirmed, using proxy indicators, that the population of the pilot rayons was
more satisfied with provided health services than the population in non-pilot rayons,
taking into account the comparison of the situation before and after project interventions.
Another external evaluation showed that community satisfaction with services at PHC
facility level increased in pilot rayons covered by Aga Khan Foundation and AKTED

83.      However, an accurate measurement of the end-of-project achievement status of
the two PDO indicators which relied on TLSS was not possible due to the discontinuation
of TLSS after 2009 and the issue of comparability of data from other sources. 68 One
might speculate that the target values set under AF2 were not achieved based on the data
from TLSS 2009. However, a sensible assessment should take into account the negative
effects of the 2008-2009 economic crisis, 69 which led to a reduction in household
incomes due to reduced migrant worker remittances from abroad 70 and an overall increase
in the price of food products. In addition, the prices of pharmaceuticals, most of which the
country had been importing, increased significantly due to the elimination of the related
import duty relief starting February 1, 2011. 71 Thus, the aggregate impact of the crisis
was to directly and negatively influence the achievement of these two PDO indicators,
and it is hard to know at the time of writing the exact extent to which the project activities
have increased the households’ access to health services. Still, what available evidence on
the improved financial protection and utilization of health services in the pilot rayons
presented above suggests that the project indeed had an ameliorating impact even if some
end-of-project targets might not have been achieved.

PDO 2 – build capacity and efficiency at national, oblast, and rayon levels in
administering a basic package of health benefits and introducing finance reforms in
primary health care.

84.     The RF—especially after the informal revision in May 2009—did not include
PDO indicators directly linked to this PDO. However, the important achievements in
building capacity and efficiency at all levels—as demonstrated by the respective IO
indicators—are evident from: (i) the MOH’s engaging HPAU as an increasingly relevant
instrument for evidence-based policymaking; (ii) adopted key strategies and enhanced
stewardship role of the MOH laying the foundation for sector development in the medium
term; (iii) strengthened M&E framework for the health sector and improved coordination
among the MOH, other GOT agencies, and DPs in addressing the needs of the health
sector through Joint Annual Reviews; (iv) MOH’s strengthened capacity for regular and
targeted communication on health reform issues through a variety of communication

   Based on a 2011 household survey on access to and quality of public services conducted in five
regions of Tajikistan under the Bank-supported “Mainstreaming Governance in Tajikistan Program?,
among those who needed outpatient / inpatient treatment in Soghd oblast, 14.3% / 6.9%, respectively,
did not sought treatment because they could not afford it. In Khatlon oblast, the responses led to
percentages of 2.9% / 7.8%, respectively. Compared to the data from TLSS 2009 (15% for Soghd and
42% for Khatlon), these additional data show slight improvement in access to health services in Soghd
and significant improvement in Khatlon. Conversely, the additional data show that share of health in
household expenditure has increased in both oblasts, with 2.5% / 5.4% on outpatient / inpatient care in
Soghd and 4.1% / 7.1% in Khatlon. However, due to possible differences in methodology these data
must be interpreted with caution.

channels at different levels; (v) training abroad of over 150 specialists at all levels in
financing and management reforms and PHC and hospital finance planning functions
internalized at the central and sub-national levels; (vi) two OHDs and health facilities in
44 rayons of the Soghd and Khatlon oblasts—which represent two thirds of the total
number of rayons in the country—fully equipped, furnished, provided with basic
information systems, and with all managerial, financial, and statistical staff trained in
computer literacy, HMIS, health management, and financial management and performing
their expanded functions; (vii) streamlined statistical reporting and routine use of HMIS
by facilities and rayon-level managers for business planning, management, and reporting
purposes; (viii) procurement capacity built at the MOH, with “Qualified Procuring
Entity? status and authorization awarded to conduct tenders autonomously.

85.     The 2012 targets for one PDO indicator and one IO indicator were not fully
achieved within the project period due to the GOT decisions to implement full capitation
and expanded BPMCS in a more phased approach in post-project period, mainly due to
fiscal constraints. However, the CBHP did support the introduction of the PHC per capita
financing in two thirds of the country where none existed before, and the experiences
from piloting the BPMCS—along with other DPs—and enhanced capacity for evidence-
based policymaking enabled GOT to take informed decisions for subsequent
implementation phase.

3.3 Efficiency
Rating: Substantial

86.     The project investments created both direct and indirect benefits for the
population in project supported areas as well as for the public administration and the
health system in general. The present value of project benefits are estimated at about
$17.4 million and the present value of costs amount to $13.9 million (component C),
implying a benefit/cost ratio of 1.2 and an economic rate of return of 23% (refer to Annex
3 for details).

87.     The fiscal sustainability analysis contained in the PAD was repeated using actual
project costs to estimate the true recurrent cost impact. It showed that the recurrent
project expenditures represent just 0.08% of total public health expenditures. Given the
six-fold increase of Tajikistan’s economy over the past seven years, significant increase
in public health expenditure over the last decade, and the healthy economic outlook, the
project’s recurrent cost impact is negligible and the investments are likely to be
sustainable.

3.4 Justification of Overall Outcome Rating
Rating: Moderately Satisfactory

88.      Although the project's relevance, efficacy, and efficiency are all rated Substantial,
the project’s overall outcome is considered Moderately Satisfactory, mainly because
progress towards efficiency objective could not be scaled up fully towards the established
target values within the project period due to the related GOT decisions conditioned by
fiscal constraints.

3.5 Overarching Themes, Other Outcomes and Impacts

(a) Poverty Impacts, Gender Aspects, and Social Development




                                             21
89.     The project’s poverty, gender and social development impact was especially
visible in GFPCR interventions. Nutritional support, education, and child development
monitoring services provided to pregnant and breastfeeding women living in lower-
income areas contributed to their households’ socioeconomic wellbeing, children’s
cognitive development and prevention of illness, thereby reducing impoverishing effects
of expenditures caused by ill-health. Due to the high level of poverty in the country72 and
labor migration of the primarily working-age rural men, the strengthened PHC networks
mostly benefitted women, children and the elderly from poor rural households in the
neediest rayons. Finally, the financing reforms aimed to provide financial protection to
the poor by enhancing equity in financing of health services.

(b) Institutional Change/Strengthening

90.     Project investments resulted in considerable institutional development impact.
This included both strengthening of the MOH, Republican Center of Medical Statistics
and Information (RCMSI), OHDs, FMTCs, PHC facilities, and hospitals’ physical
infrastructure and capacity to fulfill their expanded functions better. Capacity building
also involved the development of important strategies, tools, and mechanisms for the
sector. Substantial institutional development was also evident in the empowerment of
local communities to address their health and development needs through uniquely
tailored and well-tested mechanisms. Most importantly, the project laid the foundation for
the advancement of structural reforms by building experience, understanding, and
capacity vis-à-vis policy, financial and managerial aspects of such reforms at the central,
oblast and rayon levels.

(c) Other Unintended Outcomes and Impacts

91.     The PIU and involved PHC facilities gained the unanticipated experience of
implementing emergency humanitarian assistance. The project also expanded the health
management and financial management training to specialists from three additional
rayons after ADB support to those rayons was phased out, thus covering all the 44 rayons
of the Soghd and Khatlon oblasts.

3.6 Summary of Findings of Beneficiary Survey and/or Stakeholder Workshops

N/A

4. Assessment of Risk to Development Outcome
Rating: Moderate

92.     The achievements attained are encouraging with standardized approach to PHC
infrastructure, institutionalized community development mechanisms, and a
comprehensive PHC approach with FM courses incorporated in the university pre-
diploma curriculum and effort to further develop CME. The developed core analytical
tools and functions are increasingly being internalized by the MOH, and DPs continue to
support the MOH in this transition. Some moderate risks that development outcomes
would not be maintained remain due to the: (i) uncertain policy environment vis-à-vis


72
 At the end of 2007, 53.5% of the population was poor, and 17.1% extremely poor, according to
TLSS 2007.



                                                22
structural reforms; (ii) GOT’s limited ability to fully implement the rationalization plan;
and (iii) potential lack of sustainable institutional ownership of the HMIS development.
However, a renewed GOT commitment to reforms, core capacity for implementation
created, and improved donor coordination compensate the risks to a large extent and
make project gains unlikely to be reversed.

5. Assessment of Bank and Borrower Performance

5.1 Bank Performance

(a) Bank Performance in Ensuring Quality at Entry
Rating: Moderately Satisfactory

93.     Despite the tight preparation timetable and budget, the design was well-thought,
comprehensive, and well-targeted to the most pressing issues. It built on the prior
rigorous analytical work and lessons from the preceding PHCP, envisaged a phased
approach to reforms, and leveraged complementarities with the Bank’s policy-based
operations and other DPs’ work. Key decisions—such as the retention of the core staffing
of the PHCP PIU to implement the CBHP—were based on a solid assessment of the
situation and substantiated agreement with the government. Though an EMP was not
required for a category C project based on the prevailing practice and OPCS guidance at
the time of appraisal, its preparation and public disclosure for this project was a good
practice.

94. However, there were deficiencies in the M&E framework, which hindered adequate
measurement of the progress towards PDO achievement. Risks related to the policy and
fiscal environment—aggravated largely by the economic crisis—were either unforeseen
or underestimated.

(b) Quality of Supervision
Rating: Moderately Satisfactory

95. In general, the allocation of resources, supervision support from SDC and SIDA, and
exploration of additional funding sources enabled the task team to supervise the project
well, including effective response to the needs for international TA and implementation
of innovative activities. Comprehensive aide memoires provided detailed reviews of the
implementation progress, policy and implementation issues faced, and recommendations
for specific, time-bound actions. Likewise, the prepared ISRs provided the Bank
management with a candid overview and assessment of project performance and policy
issues. The task team’s effort to ensure fiduciary and safeguards compliance and progress
in meeting intermediate results, including civil works and disbursement targets, was
commendable.

96.      The 2008 Mid-Term Review (MTR), joined by SDC and SIDA, focused on
ensuring impact and sustainability of project investments and actions to remedy emerging
issues, including inter alia the need to reallocate funds to higher-than-expected costs of
civil works and to improve the project’s results framework.

97.    There was some inefficiency in the Bank team staffing in the early years of
implementation, and insufficiency of implementation-focused policy dialogue was a
shortcoming during supervision. No appropriate revision of the PDO indicators and
monitoring arrangements took place after TLSS was discontinued despite the obvious


                                            23
challenges in reliably measuring the progress toward achieving the PDO. Had this been
done, the project’s substantial achievements and impact could have been demonstrated
better than was eventually the case.

(c) Justification of Rating for Overall Bank Performance
Rating: Moderately Satisfactory

98.     The overall rating of Moderately Satisfactory is based on the Bank performance
during the preparation and supervision phases, as discussed above.

5.2 Borrower Performance

(a) Government Performance
Rating: Moderately Satisfactory

99.      The ownership and commitment to the project objectives by the GOT—including
the MOH, MOF, National Board on Health, and Aid Coordination Unit/CSISPM—was
strong during the preparation as evidenced by its close involvement in preparation
activities; adoption of the sensible HSFS for 2005-2015; commitment to key health
reforms stated in the LDP; and the signing and effectiveness of the DGA within
reasonable time. In addition, the GOT: adopted, although with occasional delays,
resolutions that provided legal bases for piloting BPMCS and per capita payment reforms;
retained the PHCP PIU to implement the CBHP and manage civil works; and ensured
adequate transition arrangements for regular operation of supported activities after project
closing.

100. Conversely, delays in some activities occurred during early implementation
period due to changes in MOH leadership; some policy reversals took place despite the
initial commitments expressed in the LDP; and overall political buy-in from the GOT for
rolling out the envisaged health financing reforms attenuated after 2009. The Health
Sector Master Plan has not been implemented fully in the absence of envisaged changes
in the provider payment system and broad stakeholder support for the rationalization
although it was used as a reference for constructing PHC facilities under AF2 as well as
to inform the design of the HSIP and KfW hospital investment program.

(b) Implementing Agency or Agencies Performance
Rating: Satisfactory

101. The project was ready for implementation in due course, with all systems in place
and cost estimates, job descriptions for the PIU staff, and first-year implementation plan
ready by the appraisal stage, and a comprehensive POM developed by the PIU without
any support from international TA by project effectiveness.

102. During the implementation phase, the PIU effectively carried out all aspects of
project management. All audits of the PIU’s performance were unqualified, except for
delays in submitting external audit reports for 2010 and 2011, which was beyond the
PIU’s control. The PIU responded flexibly and efficiently to changing circumstances,
including adjustments in procurement and civil works to constrained finances occasioned
by the economic crisis, coordinating the implementation with other partners, and
supervising a complex project in a difficult implementation environment while
maintaining fiduciary integrity. The MOH proposal to use the PIU to administer the
US$92 million grant from the Global Fund for AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria and three


                                            24
occasions of AF for CBHP from IDA testified to the PIU’s strong track record in project
management and disbursement.

103. As contemplated at the design stage, the PIU exercised utmost due diligence in
supervising the civil works, which is especially impressive given the scattered distribution
and remoteness of the facilities and the difficulty of completing a far-flung set of facility
constructions on time and at reasonable cost. A slightly larger number of quality
shortcomings (than had usually been the case) were reported in the November 2012
mission aide memoire. The major observed factor was the rush to complete the
construction on time, which started late due to the long winter of 2011-12, and
secondarily a perhaps somewhat weakened supervision effort by the PIU in the last year
of the project. The PIU’s involvement in policy issues was to a large extent fueled by the
MOH’s insufficient technical capacity and the PIU’s heavy focus on timely
implementation of its work program, which in many aspects was dependent on policy
actions to be taken by GOT.

(c) Justification of Rating for Overall Borrower Performance
Rating: Moderately Satisfactory

104. The overall performance of the Borrower is rated Moderately Satisfactory based
on the GOT and PIU performance, as discussed above.

6. Lessons Learned

105. The following are key lessons that have been derived from the implementation of
this project:

106. Critical to ensure adequate assessment of risks and challenges at appraisal
and during project implementation. Investment lending on its own is not sufficient
when embarking on complex structural reforms; a mix of policy-based budget support
and implementation-focused SIL has the potential of raising the effectiveness of reform
interventions. Still, when intended policy reforms are not addressed directly by an
investment operation—but coordinated on a critical path with other Bank operations or
programs of other DPs—assessment of risks should comprehensively cover and prioritize
all aspects that can affect the project interventions, including fiscal and capacity
constraints and political complexity of initiating such reforms. Expectations for
implementation of reform projects in countries with changing political environments
should be realistic and potential implementation delays should be anticipated and
proactively addressed, especially in the case of complex projects covering a wide range of
activities.

107. Government ownership and capacity development. Strenuous and continuous
efforts are critical for building technical and implementation capacity in the line
government agency implementing a reform project, especially when capacity limitations
are recognized at the design stage. Such efforts should properly address institutional,
capacity imbalance, and motivation aspects through clear definition of roles,
accountability arrangements and provision of incentives. Importantly, motivation needs to
be provided to civil servants when projects of this nature and complexity are to be
implemented by them. Although building of MOH’s implementation capacity by
integrating the PIU into the MOH over time was envisaged at CBHP design stage, it
happened in a more limited degree than expected because of (i) the legal status of the PIU
as a stand-alone legal entity with a broad range of entitlements, and (ii) the lack of


                                             25
adequate incentives on both sides to stimulate the transfer of knowledge and
implementation capacity from the PIU to the MOH. This in some cases negatively
affected ownership of project outputs by the MOH. At the same time, this project
demonstrated that close work with oblast/rayon authorities, communities, and population
was critical for building broad ownership and support to project activities at lower levels.

108. Need for effective coordination. Structural reforms have several prerequisites,
such as a shared and clear vision for reforms, building capacity and a critical mass of
supporters upfront, concerted efforts towards the vision from all stakeholders involved,
and strong champions for reforms. Therefore, in sectors involving many partners with
common areas of interest, participatory processes and transparency at all stages are
critical for sustaining effective coordination and broad support from all stakeholders
involved. Timely sharing of all relevant information, joint supervision of projects and
regular health summits focused on relevant topics can serve as effective tools for ensuring
consistency of policy dialogue with the government and positive aggregate impact on the
sector development. More importantly, such coordination initiatives should be initiated
upstream among DPs’ headquarters offices at a program planning stage to avoid
constraints in coordination at the country level when DPs’ respective programs/projects
have been pre-defined at their headquarters.

109. Appropriate staffing of Bank teams is critical. The right composition of a task
team, including specialized technical and strong task management and operational skills,
is required to supervise complex projects in challenging environments. Continuous policy
dialogue on key policy issues with all relevant stakeholders from the outset, strong
supervision and capacity building are particularly critical when embarking on complex
financing reforms in politically challenging and fiscally and capacity-wise constrained
environments.

110. Streamlined results framework and adequate monitoring arrangements are
essential to guide implementation and measure results. Although the project in many
respects was exemplary in its inherent relevance to Bank policies and country strategies,
it proved once again the critical need for performance indicators to be carefully selected
at the design stage or appropriately revised during implementation.

111. Safeguards. Lack of full compliance with the Bank’s safeguards requirements in
projects involving civil works in a country with weak overall capacity is a common
occurrence. The Bank teams should anticipate that construction on new sites might
become necessary even if not initially envisaged and, therefore, ensure an appropriate
mechanism is in place to confirm the location and nature of works prior to their initiation.
Moreover, relevant and adequate capacity building for implementing agencies is critical
for understanding of and compliance with the Bank’s requirements. Collectively, these
will ensure that the Bank is notified in due time and all necessary assessments and plans
are prepared together with the Client before civil works start.

7. Comments on Issues Raised by Borrower/Implementing Agencies/Partners

(a) Borrower/implementing agencies

112. The ICR team acknowledged most of the MOH’s comments enclosed in full in
Annex 7. An effort was undertaken to obtain from other possible sources additional
objective evidence supporting or refuting the initial rating of overall outcome as
Moderately Unsatisfactory. As a consequence, additional information provided by the


                                            26
Ministry of Health and external survey data 73 (re-calculated for the ICR purposes) has led
to the ICR team’s conviction that the overall outcome rating should be upgraded to
Moderately Satisfactory. All the relevant comments have been incorporated as far as
possible in the final version of this ICR.

   Over-spending is explained by the increase in construction materials prices and cost of sub-
contractors services due to high inflation, as well as rehabilitation of additional facilities under AF1
and AF2.
79
   Due to (i) reallocations of funds to Operating Costs category on two occasions (see Table (d)) related
to (a) initial underestimation of costs, (b) increase in costs related to administration of additional
activities, and (c) increase in costs caused by the financial crisis; (ii) increase in value of the
international consultancy contract for development of HMIS which originated from the increase in
income tax rate for non-residents from 15% to 25% starting January 2010, according the amended Tax
Code; and (iii) and currency gains due to appreciation of SDR and Swedish Krona against USD.

Cost-Benefit Analysis

1. Background

Tajikistan is the poorest of the former Soviet republics and even today is still recovering from
armed conflict scars. Health outcomes are poor and the country increasingly faces a double
burden of communicable and non-communicable diseases. Maternal and child health are a
major challenge and the country is unlikely to meet the MDGs for infant and child mortality.
After decades of neglect, the health infrastructure is dilapidated, and major investments are
needed to retrain health workers on family medicine. Funding in the health sector is highly
unequal and largely concentrated at the secondary and tertiary levels at the detriment of PHC.
Limited managerial capacity in the health sector contributes to perpetuate inefficient
financing practices.

To help overcome some of these key health sector challenges, the CBHP promoted the
implementation of several activities that intended to (i) strengthen the national capacity for
health policy, planning and donor coordination, (ii) implement organizational and financing
reforms in the health sector and (iii) strengthen PHC in selected rayons.

At the time of the last ISR, almost all CBHP planned activities under the project had been
completed. Some, but not all, of the PDO level indicators as well as the intermediate results
indicators have been achieved. The health physical and human capital infrastructure has been
strengthened, with a total of 68 buildings including 61 PHC facilities and 7 other buildings
(oblast health departments, training centers, MOH premises, etc.) rehabilitated or replaced
and 1,123 PHC personnel retrained in family medicine. A system of PHC capitation has been
implemented in 44 districts and there are plans to further extend it nationally. A Health Policy
and Analysis Unit (HPAU) has been established within the MOH to monitor and evaluate
health reforms and provide policy advice in response to MOH needs.

This economic analysis intends to review the development impact of the CBHP in Tajikistan.
In particular, the analysis aims to provide evidence on the project costs and benefits and, to
the extent possible, estimate the cost-benefit of the investments that were done during the
course of the project.

2. Methodology, data and assumptions

The project investments created both direct and indirect benefits for the population in project
supported areas as well as for the public administration and the health system in general. The
methodology used for assessing the direct and indirect benefits as well as the project costs are
discussed in order below.

    2.1. Direct benefits

The project benefits comprised several measures of direct impact, which included enhanced
service quality at the primary care level through improved physical and human capital
infrastructure. The project promoted improvements in the PHC infrastructure and a marked
increase in the number of doctors and nurses trained in family medicine. 290 doctors and 833
nurses in 9 rayons had received training in family medicine in the project areas at closing. The
resulting increase in service quality contributed to improved patient satisfaction, as




                                              39
documented by a project impact evaluation report. 83 Although available data is somewhat
mixed, the overall improved utilization of (mostly) PHC services in the pilot rayons suggests
enhanced access to health services in those rayons. The improvements in service quality and
personnel capacity led to significant increase in the number of visits to PHC facilities per
capita per year in most project-supported areas. The change in the number of visits to PHC
facilities per capita per year was estimated at 118% in Asht, 144% in Spitamen, -54% in
Kabodiyon, 165% in Nurek, 76% in Sarband, -18% in Shuraabad, and 38% in Temurmalik.

It is likely that the increased utilization of primary care services led to subsequent reduced
need for more expensive secondary and specialist care. Nevertheless, direct estimates of the
impact on the utilization of secondary care level services of the increase in primary care visits
are not available from direct project data. In line with impact estimates from other similar
World Bank projects, we assume that total inpatient days from unnecessary hospital
admissions were reduced by 30% as a result of enhanced utilization of outpatient care. Using
estimates from the WHO-CHOICE database, the cost per inpatient day is estimated at about
$5.7 and the cost per outpatient visit at around $1.3.

     2.2. Indirect benefits

Indirect benefits were derived from improved process indicators such as increased
implementation capacity of the MOH and other government bodies in addressing the needs of
health sector. Similarly, there are indications that the project promoted enhanced donor
coordination, which contributed to increase the amount of resources available to support the
health sector, as evidenced for example by the sustained international support for the
continuation of certain project activities. In addition, the introduction of capitation financing
reforms is likely to have contributed to greater efficiency in the delivery of PHC services.
More broadly, it is reasonable to expect that the project had significant indirect economic
benefit on the wider economy. For instance, the increased access and utilization of health care
services is expected to lead to improvements in health status. These, in turn, would reduce
productivity losses, lower absenteeism, increase payoff periods and returns to investment in
child health and, possibly, reduce future need for health care spending (an ounce of
prevention is worth a pound of cure).

Nevertheless, no direct evidence is available to corroborate these hypotheses regarding the
indirect impact of the CBHP. Therefore, in line with previous assessments of the economic
impact of the project, the scope of this economic analysis will be limited to the areas where
there is more readily available information.

     2.3. Project costs

As discussed above, since we cannot reasonably estimate the economic benefit of all project
activities, the economic analysis will be restricted to the Component C. The estimated total
project costs for the original CBHP, AF1, AF2, and SIDA/SDC financing is shown below.
Resources from the Global Food Price Crisis Response TF are not included in the analysis
because these activities had a slightly different nature and the outcomes from the Food Grant
can be considered time-limited.

The total project cost was $26.77 million for the overall period out which of $15.62 million
(58% of total) was used to support activities under Component C. The projected was
implemented over a period of 7 years, with both the total annual investments and the annual
investments in infrastructure (Component C) peaking in 2008.

3. Cost-benefit analysis and measures of economic efficiency

As noted in the Bank’s Economic Analysis Guidance Note 84, not all project benefits can be
expressed in monetary terms; indeed, some project benefits are often “difficult to monetize or
even quantify but can be demonstrated to be important as project outcomes?. In the case of
the CBHP, the lack of available evidence limits the scope of the analysis than can be
performed. Most of the available data refers to information on process or output indicators
and there is limited information on outcome indicators to enable a quantitative analysis of the
economic returns to investment. For example, the increased number of health workers and
other health sector staff that received training (inputs) lead to significant improvements in the
quantity and quality of services delivered (outputs). For instance, outpatient visits per capita
increased by 70% on average in project areas. Still, it is unclear how these improvements
translate into the impact on health outcomes and, ultimately, greater economic benefits.
Therefore, in line with previous project papers, this analysis is limited to only a subset of the
full spectrum of activities supported by the project, specifically those supported under
Component C.

                                                                   3 percent discount rate
     Present value of project benefits (Thous.US$)                 17,412
     Present value of Component C cost (Thous.US$)                 13,937
     Present value of project net benefits (Thous.US$)             3,475
     Benefit/Cost ratio                                            1.2
     Economic rate of return                                       23%

The results of this economic analysis cannot be compared to the original economic analysis
because the CBHP original PAD does not include an economic analysis. However, a
subsequent project paper for additional financing conducted an economic analysis focused
specifically on subcomponent C1 and estimated the internal rate of return at 9% for the first
five years. The estimates provided here give a conservative estimation of the project benefits
that does not take into account several measures of indirect impact and, in the absence of
project-level evidence, assumes limited effectiveness of some of the main project activities.

Fiscal Sustainability Analysis

A fiscal sustainability analysis carried out as part of the PAD estimated recurrent expenditures
for project investments and compared the total cost impact with projected increases in public
health expenditure by the GOT. Total annual recurrent costs were estimated at US$1,085,000.
As non-salary expenditures in PHC were projected to increase by US$1.4 million in 2006, it
was concluded that the project investments were likely to be sustainable after completion.

In order to assess the fiscal sustainability of project investments after completion, this
analysis was repeated using actual project costs to estimate the recurrent cost impact. Data on
government health expenditures during the project period were provided by the MOH.

Only the parts of project components with a recurrent cost impact were included in the
analysis; namely civil works, vehicles and equipment (medical, information technology and
office). Salary costs associated with the continued functioning of the Health Policy Analysis
Unit were excluded as either further funding was being provided by other project partners or
functions were being absorbed by pre-existing MOH employees.

Assumptions for the analysis included the following (as per original analysis):

    •   Civil works
            o maintenance allowance of 2.5% of investment cost
            o an immediate need for full maintenance on new facilities
            o depreciation to zero over 50 years
    •   Vehicles
            o maintenance allowance of 10% of investment cost
            o depreciation to zero over 10 years
    •   Equipment
            o maintenance allowance of 5% of investment cost
            o depreciation to zero over 5 years for information technology equipment
            o depreciation to zero over 10 years for medical and office equipment

Table 3.1 displays the parts of project components with a recurrent cost impact. The annual
recurrent expenditure of the project going forward was estimated to be US$1,081,615.

 Table 3.2 displays public health expenditures by the GOT during the project period. Public
 health expenditures as a percentage of GDP rose from 1.3% to 2% during the project period,
 with a 47% increase from 2010 to 2011. In particular, expenditure on PHC increased from
 US$7.1 million in 2007 to 32.4 million in 2011. In 2011, non-salary expenditures in PHC
 were US$4.9 million, five times the estimated annual recurrent cost expenditures.

 The recurrent project expenditures represent just over three percent of PHC expenditures for
 2011 and just 0.08% of total public health expenditures. Furthermore, the economy of
 Tajikistan has increased six-fold over the past seven years. Given the significant increase in
 public health expenditures in Tajikistan over the last decade and the healthy economic
 outlook, the recurrent cost impact of this project is negligible and project investments are
 likely to be sustainable.

Dear Davlatali Shomakhmadovich,

The Ministry of Health of the Republic of Tajikistan extends its gratitude to SCISPM for
cooperation and continuous support in the settlement of issues regarding the implementation
of investment projects in the health sector and presents for your appraisal a copy of the letter
and the report of the CBHP PIU regarding the implementation of the item II of the Aide-
Memoire dated December 13, 2012 of the CBHP mission, where it touches upon a number of
tasks to be implemented at the final stage of the Community Based Health Project (Grant
H586-TJ) till 31 December 2012.

It must be noted that in accordance with the information from the PIU Director, the form and
way of reporting was discussed with the World Bank. The report had been sent to the
Ministry of Health.



Respectfully,



Minister                                 (signed)                 N. Salimov

1.0. Project initialization and project context at the evaluation stage

1.1. Historical context at the evaluation stage:

Political context: During the years following the collapse of the soviet system,
Tajikistan endured the most severe political crisis civil conflict (1992-1997) resulting in
multiple human losses among non-combatants, considerable destruction of the social
infrastructure, including in the health sector, entire economic decline among former
soviet republics, and destruction of the recently existing public management principles
based on soviet system of the country management. Qualified staff outflow, need to
rehabilitate post-conflict destructions, establishment and formation of new country
management structures, formation of the new political forces and parties, creation of
the nation-building legal framework were important political challenges faced at
project onset.

Social and economic situation. Despite the impressive progress achieved in the last
decade, Tajikistan is still the lowest income country in the world with estimated per
capita GNI at US$200 in 2003. Tajikistan’s population had fairly low health indicators
among the CIS countries and its epidemiological situation is close to the countries with
the lowest income in the world.

Main challenges in the health sector: The health system in Tajikistan has multiple
structural weaknesses: PHC doesn’t receive adequate attention; number of hospitals is
greater than needed and their services are too expensive for the poor; health staff
salaries are low and this forces them to take out-of-pocket payments for services; and
development of HR capacity and health education are carried out insufficiently. There
are major gaps in the Health strategy, especially in its planning and management at all
levels and at the health facility administrations. Infrastructure is in very poor condition.
Notwithstanding these problems, the Government of Tajikistan has agreed to carry out
a range of budgetary and organizational reforms in the framework of the WB Loan for
strategy development and implementation (LSDI) that will strengthen management and
reinforce flow of funds towards to PHC. There is no well-defined management in the
health policy in Tajikistan. In fact, concurrence on the common sector strategy is absent.
the lack of internal dialogue among key parties – MOH, MOF and in particular, the
Executive President’s Office, results in the policy incoherence. It is reflected in donor
activity that has been defined by weak coordination until recently.

Institutional environment: Project implementation was carried out by the Project
Implementation Unit on the behalf of the MOH. For greater PIU integration with MOH
and other partners and with the purpose to build internal MOH capacity for
implementing projects and other appropriate responsibilities, the PIU has been moved
closer to the MOHSIDASIDA.

1.2. Project components and subcomponents.

PROJECT GOALS AND OBJECTIVES. THE PRINCIPAL PROJECT OBJECTIVE
IS STRENGTHENING OF THE MINISTRY OF HEALTH’S CAPACITY AND
EFFECTIVENESS, IMPROVING HEALTH CARE MANAGEMENT AT THE
NATIONAL, OBLAST AND RAYON LEVELS, AS WELL AS ENHANCING THE
ACCESS, USE AND PATIENT SATISFACTION OF HEALTH SERVICES.

Project Summary:




                                               50
CBHP was implemented oveer four years with a preparation period of twelve months.
Primarily total project amount was US$17.3 million including contingencies. The
project was financed with grant funds provided by IDA in the amount of US$10 million,
US$6 million from the Swedish International Development Agency (SIDASIDA) and
US$1.2 million from the Swiss Agency for Development and Cooperation (SDC). The
project was implemented in two oblasts: Khatlon and Sughd according to
administrative-territorial division of these oblasts apart from rayons where ADB
operated; and six pilot rayons: Asht and Spitamen (Sughd Oblast), Shurobod,
Kabodiyon, Nurek and Sarband (Khatlon Oblast) selected based on need; where the
infrastructure of existing health facility network has been rehabilitated, staff has been
trained on family medicine (physicians and nurses), was and community outreach was
carried out.

2 Design, implementation and project impact

2.1. Assessment of the project design:

Design of this project, despite its fair ambitiousness, is optimal for achieving the stated
goals; moreover project design has been elaborated in such a way that successful
implementation of the scheduled activities and objective attainment required new levels
of coordination among donor health sector community and intersectoral and
subordinate public institutions, major international non-governmental organizations,
public authorities at the national, oblast and rayon level, communities and mass media.

However, according to the independent final assessment, innovative design of this
project was recognized as successful and became an important factor of the project
goals achievement.

2.2. Principal outcomes, achieved objectives (i.e. on basic efficiency indicators and
under each component/ sub-component.

Component ? - Strengthening Policy, Planning and Donor Coordination in the
Ministry of Health (MOH) – is aimed at strengthening MOH capacity through
developing evidence based health policy, establishing Health Policy Analysis Unit
(HPAU), supporting donor coordination and working groups engaged into development
of the strategic conceptual documents of health system reforming, strengthening public
relations, and executing health sector reforms.

Achievements:

        1. HPAU has been established according to the Decree of the MOH No.
        413 dated 14.07.07. HPAU has attained certain objectives, such as: conduction
        of three large-scale BBP introduction evaluations (HPAU support), a range of
        studies on per capita financing introduction, case-based payment system;
        involvement in development of the National Population Health Strategy until
        2020, National Health Accounts, technical support when collecting information
        for developing the Health Facilities Master Plan; HPAU has collaborated with
        development partners in supporting the SWAp introduction, preparation for the
        Donor Community Steering Committees (SC) meetings, and participation in
        the international congresses with the scientific research outcomes etc.

       informational support to the SC activity, specialized working groups and
       interagency organizations and is a liaison among operating various specialized
       working groups (over 44) providing them continuity and mutual awareness; 16
       consultants have been hired to strengthen the capacity of MOH, and 168 MOH
       specialists and its departments receivedspecial training abroad.

       3. A Master Plan for health facilities restructuring was developed. The Master
       Plan reflects long-term vision and objectives for achieving effective and
       sustainable growth in the health sector. The Strategic Plan on Health Facilities
       Rationalization in Tajikistan for 2011-2020 has been approved by the GOT
       Resolution No 169 dated April 1 2011; MOH has also approved Health HR
       Development Program of the Republic of Tajikistan for 2011 -2015, developed
       under the HPAU support.

       4. Support for conducting over 10 summits, substantial number of round
       tables, SC meetings on transition issues to SWAp and donor community (DC)
       consolidation have been carried out and facilitated Availability of the
       specialized sub-divisions and officials engaged in donor coordination within
       the MOH organizational chart will create a basis for achieving donor
       coordination sustainability.

Subcomponent C3: PHC Training Strengthening aimed at provision of equal access
to population of 6 pilot rayons to more qualified Primary Healthcare.

Achievements:

   •   Trainings of doctors and paramedical staff of pilot rayons in family
       medicine are completed (so far 1,123 people graduated --290 doctors and 833
       nurses--, which is 104% of the planned target);

   •   Improved equal access of population of about all pilot rayons to the qualified
       PHC services

   •   The working conditions of re-trained specialists were bettered through
       improved PHC infrastructure (rehabilitated and reconstructed health facilities,
       equipment with modern clinical and laboratory equipment, cold chain that
       enabled to increase of population access to the updated PHC services)

       facilities of the country are conducted with involvement of international
       technical assistance, the results of evaluation and recommendations offered are
       adopted and approved by the Ministry of Health.

Subcomponent С4. Responding to the food crisis. The World Bank responded to the
humanitarian crisis in the country by allocating additional financing for the
improvement of women and children nutritional status through conduction of
trainings on rational nutrition, delivery of food, micronutrients for pregnant and
lactating women, infants and children as well as provision of PHC centers with
stadiometer and scales.




                                            55
Achievements:

            •   The admission and early registration of pregnant women was
                increased. Doctors believe that activities such as the distribution of
                food supplements to pregnant women, micronutrients and information
                materials is a good incentives for women to apply a doctor at early
                stage for registration of pregnancy and allows physicians to examine
                them and recovery if necessary.

            •   80% of trained women apply the knowledge gained into the practice,
                they use into their diet more fruits and vegetables, meat products (as
                far as possible). It is worth to notice that 62% out of re-trained women
                continue breast-feeding their children. 64,3% out of trained women
                who have children under 6 months continued breast-feeding while
                only 31,2% respondents not taken attended the trainings continued
                breast-feeding.
            •   The widespread and proper use of growth monitoring equipment,
                consistent and correct account of anthropometric data. Visit of 51
                health facilities showed that the scales and stadiometers available are
                used and the results are fixed in the case-record book of a child.

            •   Analysis of indicators by districts of Sughd region describes that
                there is a positive trend indicators such as: growing coverage of
                children (up to 134.3% in August 2009 compared to June 2009) that
                are measured height and weight, and assessed the development of the
                child according to the new standards; Increase the identification of
                children with malnutrition at 58.8%; Increase the percentage of
                children with malnutrition registered from 67.7% to 79.9%.

            •   Sufficient level of public awareness through the media. To inform
                the public about the rational nutrition and the project activities on
                subcomponent C 4 for the reporting period was implemented: at the
                national and regional TV broadcasting composed 350 minutes of air
                time and on the radio - 58 minutes. 32 publications were placed in
                newspapers, 21 informative articles were put sites. Analysis of the
                questionnaires of household survey showed that 61% of women
                received information about rational nutrition through television and
                radio broadcasts, in newspapers and publications.

Component D – Project Management. Project Implementation Unit has been
established on the basis of the Resolution of the Government of Republic of Tajikistan
dated March 11, 2000 # 99 and currently is functioning as CBHP Management. PIU
activities are implemented based on Constitution of Republic of Tajikistan, general
laws, regulations and rules of the country.

2.3. Lessons learned

     - Needs to closely cooperate with many stakeholders during the implementation
       of the project, specifically multifaceted participation in organization and
       management of HPAU (CBHP, SIDA, WHO, MOH are involved), outreach
       activities (ACTED, Mercy Corps, Aga-Khan Fund) required substantial efforts
       on development of mechanism of joint activities, bid time expenditures to create
       a dialogue; And there were cases where the consensus was very hard to achieve.




                                             56
     - Well-coordinated team work of PIU jointly with MOH RT, Oblast Health
       Department of Sughd and Khatlon, as well as WB team during the whole period
       of implementation contributed to the better project facilitation in general.

     - Capacity strengthening of CBH PIU specialists and staff, i.e. training while
       working may be also considered as important lesson in capacity strengthening
       for the country.

     - Initial forecasts were not always realized as for rate of reform advance,
       especially financial reforms were considered adequate to implemented on
       grounds due to the influence of different out-of project factors (for instance,
       BBP implementation postponing at the level of pilot Oblast because of
       insufficient preparation of rayons, etc).

     - The implementation of the project demonstrated that availability of prepared
       cadres on the grounds can create conditions for reforming at Primary level.

2.4. Project Impact to the reforming in health sector based on final evaluation of
the project

The satisfaction of population with healthcare delivery is essentially higher in pilot
rayons compared to the control rayons. It is characterized by the impact of all
components of the projects; there is list of evidences available for it. However, for the
further improvement of healthcare quality this sphere should remain prioritized.

Application of health services, especially at primary care level was increased and
there is significant difference between pilot and control rayons. The larger increase
in number and more medical and nursing references are observed in the pilot rayons
compared to control ones, as a result of implementation of technical component
(maintenance, equipment of facilities and staff), training (training of family specialists)
and community-based components.

In general, "no admission" for healthcare has declined over the years to a
sufficient extent, mainly by improving outpatient care. Residents of the pilot
districts rarely postpone visits to a doctor, if it is necessary, compared to that of control
rayons, respectively, 33.4% admissions compared to 36.4% in the control rayons.

The most common reason of “no admission? is financial lack to apply for services
(80% of total responses).

The increase of health sector capacity at national, oblast and rayon levels in health and
financial management as a result of the project implementation is obvious. The practice
of conducting main researches is introduced which is supported by the project to get
evidences during the health policy formation. Increase of capacity is also reflected in
the use of computer technologies at all levels, maintenance of all techniques provided

    - Main solutions promoting the implementation of the project: Qualitative
      preparation of project proposals, tracing frequency of CBHP implementation
      progress, Support of efforts on MOH capacity strengthening, OHDs, focus on
      strengthening of analytical approach and enhancement of involvement rate state
      structures as one of the factors of post-project sustainability and reinforcement of
      cooperation of health sector of Tajikistan with Donor Community.

    - Main decisions preventing the project implementation: any

    - Assessment of activities of supervision mission of the WB: Recommendations of
      WB team on the results of systematic general missions reflected in aide memoir
      contributed to the timely implementation of measures and accomplishment of
      goals set within the project frameworks.

3.2. Evaluation of activities of Government during the preparation and
implementation of the project:

3.2.1. Main decisions contributing to the project implementation:

    • Well-timed and coordinated selection of pilot CBHP-covered rayons and Oblasts.

    • Well-timed signing of agreements for execution of additional grants: (i)
      Financing agreement dated 22.05.09 (Grant №H461TJ); (ii) Financing
      Agreement dated 05.08.10 (Grant №H586TJ), (iii) Grant Agreement dated
      17.07.08 from Trust fund on emergent Situations.
    • Resolution of the Republic of Tajikistan No 169 dated 01.04.2011 «Strategic
      Plan of health facilities Rationalization of Republic of Tajikistan for the period of
      2011-2020?.

    • Availability of relevant organizational and regulatory terms for CBHP
      implementation.

3.2.2. Main decisions (or lack of them) preventing the project implementation: any

3.2.3. Monitoring of MOH and PIU.

CBHP implementation has been accomplished based on data collection on fulfillment
of tasks of the project component and subcomponents using quantitative efficiency
indicators given in PAD and Operational Manual with logical relations to the expected
results. The efficiency indicators are set in these documents per implementation years
(monitoring indicators). Expected results per components and project in general
suppose achievement of situation with many constituents undergoing different factors.
That’s why the indicators formulated are complex and include several subcomponents
such as repair, equipment, and training. During the monitoring system building, the
logic scheme and project implementation process itself was taken into account which
consists of 4 stages: contribution, implementation process, results at the end and remote
impact. The following constituents of monitoring and evaluation were identified as: (i)
Monitoring and Evaluation instruments; (ii) Data collection methods and sources;
(iii) Ways of checking the data provided; (iv) Reporting/Accountability system. Such
data collection methods were used as monitoring cards, sampling from secondary
sources, conduction of personal researches, working meetings, Steering sessions,
fieldtrips with other donors, brief overviews/analytical notes, conduction of seminars,
monitoring fieldtrip of profiled MOH working groups by subdivisions of MOH,
Oblast Health Units.



                                               58
As well as the regular instrument of monitoring and evaluation of project progress is
systematic semiannual general missions of WB team. The main document upon the
completion of mission - the aide memoir is presented to the Government of RT,
National Committee on Investments and State Property Management, Ministry of
Finance and Health, other stakeholders.

Systematic reporting/accountability, reports structure. PIU is preparing a report on
Project Implementation status, where the monitoring indicators of all project
components are reflected. Twice per year the efficiency indicators are updated, the
report is developed on project management before the arrival of mission of WB
specialists. Detailed Report on application of funds and dynamics of execution of
planned measures, and brief information of project implementation progress is
presented on monthly basis for coordinating and inspecting investment projects of State
and MOH RT.

Project Evaluation. The interim evaluation was implemented. It did not change the
design of the project: some formulations of table of indicators were made. To define the
impact rate of community and basic health project on strengthening of capacity of
MOH of RT, promotion of conditions and achievement of results of organizational and
financial reforms of the sector as well as improvement of accessibility, quality and
satisfaction with PHC services in 6 pilot rayons.

3.2.4. Adjustments made by the Government and its impact to the monitoring and
project implementation:

CBH PIU director was changed due to the reaching of retirement age of former PIU
Director; In accord with RT Legislation and adhering WB procedures a new director of
PIU was appointed based on open competition, negative influence on the project
implementation of administration change is not observed; The PIU activities are keep
being evaluated positively in aide memoir.

3.3. Efficiency evaluation and quality of interaction of WB and Government in the
course of Project Implementation is quite satisfactory.

3.4. Efficiency assessment of different organizations, companies and technical
assistance during the project implementation (expenses compared to the benefits
gained)

Conducted international and local technical assistances during the project
implementation for the development of a number of major strategic documents, studies
and surveys, as well as civil works, training and equipping of facilities were very useful
in health care system that promote advancement of organizational and financial health
reforms.

4.1. Project expenses: Forecasting expenditures at the evaluation stage against actual
expenses by (i) components and subcomponents and by (ii) expenditure category and
(iii) source of financing (equivalent in USD), if available. Grants amount allocated for
the project implementation for all components and subcomponents as well as for
categories and source of financing inclusive of supplementary inflows has been entirely
disbursed. Amount of five grants (without C4 - food crisis grant) at the moment of the
agreement signing composed 25.3 mln.USD, and at the project completion it is 26.8
mln.USD. Excess of the disbursed amount is based on the foreign exchange gain,
received in the result of SDR and Swedish Krona fluctuations against USD during the
project implementation period.


                                              59
4.2. Operational annual expenses impacting the budget. Project design has specified
the PHC strengthening by rehabilitating primary level facilities already available within
the health structure and construction of the new ones, expenditures for which are
incorporated in the budget; such additional expenditures related to purchased radio and
communication equipment for the ambulance cars in 7 pilot rayons (annual payment for
the radiofrequency, generators (fuel purchasing) were covered through financial
support by local authorities.

4.3. Impact on institutional structure, established and supported by the project.
Within the project there were established such institutional structures as HPAU in
MOH structure and Press-Center; 60 sites are rehabilitated and constructed including
RHC, RuHC, HH, Oblast TCCFM of Sughd and Khatlon. 4 more RuHCs will be
constructed and equipped as well as a RHC of Temurmalik rayon will be rehabilitated
due to the end of 2012. Re-trained FM specialists provided with medical wallets within
the project are working in them. Training and re-training of FM specialists covered by
the budget is planned to implement in Training Centers with active use of all
subdivisions and structures: auditoriums, internet, presentation techniques, libraries,
use of capacity of trained doctors.

5. Main lessons learned:


5.1. A number of important organizational and financial reforms of the health sector
require coordination with many other agencies, as well as adoption of relevant
Resolutions by the Government of RT (e.g.: BBP expansion across the pilot Region,
Per-capita financing piloting with all types of expenses, etc.), which does not always
correspond with the planned project activities.

5.2. Implementation of multi-component project, which essentially is complex program
requires the formation of a competent team for the project fulfillment; it was the right
decision project was implemented by PIU team, that had experience of execution of
alike projects which are assessed as satisfactory.

5.3. Successful execution of multilevel and complex project the great role of which
plays Ministry of Health of RT and its subdivisions, international non-governmental
organizations, construction organizations, Training centers etc. demands development
and introduction of new coordination mechanisms with all stakeholders using Sector
Wide Approach.

5.4. Matters of further project sustainability should be resolved not at implementation
or completion stage but at that of development of concept basis of project proposal as a
certain strategy of project “exit? from the pilot areas.

5.5. Unorganized political environment, imperfection of structural building of co-
subordination of health facilities at different levels of healthcare protection of
population due to the numerous vertical programs, crudity of creation of Rayon health
Departments and other aspects of organizational character were also crucial factor
impacting project implementation progress.

6. Sustainability of project investments

It is worth to acknowledge the investments made sustainable as there are such aspects
like: (i) establishment of HPAU, development of different strategic documents (ii)
strengthening of infrastructure of MOH, OHDs of Sughd and Khatlon, TCCFM, PHC


                                              60
facilities of pilot rayons, (iii) trained FM specialists,(iv) Promotion of AF at all 44
rayons of Sughd and Khatlon, and BPP in 3 pilot rayons with transition of functions on
management of the issues to the trained specialists of pilot OHDs within the project.
Hence, sustainability is achieved through the institutionalization, increase of skills and
abilities of specialists involved, formation of responsible relations of communities to
the healthcare, creation of regulatory basis, transition of functions and responsibilities
to the relevant state structures and local authorities.

                                   Dear Ms. Marsha Olive!

         The Ministry of Health of the Republic of Tajikistan would like to express its
gratitude for the support and cooperation in the field of health reforms of the Republic of
Tajikistan. At the same time, having studied the draft Community and Basic Health Project
Implementation Completion and Results Report (IDA-H1950, IDA-H5860), the Ministry
would like to present the following comments.
         It is worth noting that the Implementing Agency for this Project is the Ministry of
Health of the Republic of Tajikistan which implemented the Project through the Project
Implementation Unit. Over the period of the Community and Basic Health Project
implementation from 2005 through 2012, the health system has achieved certain progress
which significantly influenced the quality of and access to health services in the pilot districts.
         As such, the wording of the Project Development Objectives focuses on building
capacity in administering the process of introduction of the Basic Benefit Package (BBP) and
primary health care (PHC) financing reforms rather than enhancing efficiency of the BBP and
financing reforms. In our case, the original Project design fairly assumed that the Project
Development Objective should be namely strengthening capacity in managing the BBP
introduction process and not BBP efficiency, as a probable long-term outcome, as such.
Evidences of a significant progress achieved in BBP administration by the Ministry of Health
are as follows:
     — the Ministry of Health’s leading role has been strengthened through the conduction of
         thematic health summits;
     — clearer distribution of strategic areas under the financing reforms between the
         Development Partners (DPs);
     — the Health Policy Analysis Unit (HPAU) has independently conducted a number of
         BBP surveys with elements of population interviewing;
     — in-depth study by the Ministry of Health of the Sughd Oblast budget financing for
         potential risks of BBP extension to all districts of Sughd Oblast.
         As far as the population’s access to health services is concerned, it should be noted
that 3 surveys have been conducted by independent survey firms under the assessment of
financial burden of inpatient and outpatient services in the pilot districts after the introduction
of the Basic Benefit Package. The results of these surveys showed that, compared with the
control districts, the pilot districts had the level of informal payments reduced and the number
of PHC visits increased, and introduction of the copayment scheme has improved the
operation of health facilities.
         It must be acknowledged that BBP has significantly strengthened the targeted access
for the most vulnerable population; so, if approximately 30% of hospitalized patients
belonged to the category of the supposed exempt population before the BBP introduction, this
percentage has approached 60% already by 2012. One should note that a significant part of
this cohort was represented by maternity patients, thus evidencing that the accessibility of in-
patient obstetrics was ensured to some extent by BBP.


                                                62
         The Ministry of Health considers this a rather strong argument for the achievement of
the indicators as this means that BBP introduction has played in general a positive role for the
most vulnerable population in the pilot districts.
         Regarding the strengthening of capacity in administering per-capita financing (PCF),
the following positive aspects should also be noted:
     — practically all districts of the country, including all the Project’s pilot districts, use the
         PCF principle to calculate their budgets, and this mechanism has been solidly
         established at the national level (when the Project started, no districts used PCF);
     — the adoption of a more reasonable approach to sector reforming, i.e. phased
         introduction of a new health financing mechanism (Decree of the Government of the
         Republic of Tajikistan No 536), provides an evidence of improved administration
         skills at the republican and oblast levels together with improved coordination with the
         Development Partners;
     — joint Decree of the Ministries of Finance and Health (No 49-No 237 dated April 25,
         2013) “On Introducing Full Per-capita Financing in PHC Facilities of Sughd Oblast
         from June 1, 2013? was signed. This provides an evidence that the practical
         implementation of full per-capita financing has started.
         The change of the status of the indicator “100% per-capita financing in Spitamen
rayon and 20% per-capita financing in the remaining 43 rayons of the two Project oblasts?
from the PDO level indicator to the Intermediate Outcome indicator also bespeaks better per-
capita financing administration by the Ministry of Health (the Tajik and English copies of the
letters of the Ministry of Health and the Ministry of Finance are attached).
         On the basis of the official data (reports of state supervision departments and services,
the Health Policy Analysis Unit under the Ministry of Health), it is proposed to change the
rating of the BBP administration capacity building indicators from Moderately Unsatisfactory
into Satisfactory.
         Also, we disagree with the Overall Outcome Rating assessed as Moderately
Unsatisfactory. 85 The explanation of such a rating, which is mainly because of “the limited
ability to substantiate the argument of increased access to health services in project-supported
areas? (p. 27), is unpersuasive. As noted above, the results of the surveys conducted by the
Health Policy Analysis Unit under the Ministry of Health under BBP (baseline survey,
surveys conducted 3 and 15 months after BBP introduction) showed that the patients’
satisfaction with the quality of health services provided to them has increased in the pilot
districts after BBP introduction. The BBP introduction has slowed down the growth of the
patients’ financial burden. A significant decrease in the volumes of informal payments to the
health staff is observed in the pilot districts compared with the control ones. BBP has
contributed to the enhancement of transparency within the health financing system. It is worth
noting that along with that, there are problems regarding full coverage of BBP by the state
budget due to the increased number of health services provided to the exempt population. To
address this issue, the Ministry of Health holds negotiations with the Ministry of Finance and
other relevant agencies to increase the volume of health sector financing.
         Given the above considerations, the Ministry of Health of the Republic of Tajikistan
finds it acceptable to consider changing the outcome rating from Moderately Unsatisfactory
to Substantial.




85
  The original draft that was sent for comments to Government had an MU rating. But then new data
emerged on outcomes by Geographical area that confirmed more progress than initially described on
health outcomes included in the project's results framework. This led to an upgrade in the rating.




                                                 63
       The Ministry of Health of the Republic of Tajikistan avails itself of this opportunity
to express once again its appreciation for the cooperation and support in the field of
improving health of the population of our republic.


Sincerely yours,

Minister                                    /Signed/                           N. Salimov


Annex 8. Comments of Cofinanciers and Other Partners/Stakeholders

In its e-mail of June 5, 2013, SIDA indicated that it had no further comments on the draft ICR
and looked forward to receiving the final report.

SDC provided comments on the draft ICR by e-mail of June 13, 2013. Overall, SDC agreed
with the overall outcome rating of the project as Moderately Satisfactory. 86 SDC confirmed
that the ICR "thoroughly describes inputs and achievements of the project, sheds a light to the
lessons learned and most importantly well describes the process of the project
implementation. [SDC] appreciates that critical assessment of some project’s activities,
particularly related to health financing reforms, is done considering not only the challenging
environment in which the project had to be implemented but also acknowledging the
complexity of the project objectives which have been developed during the project’s design
without thorough estimation of risk factors. Though sustainability of the project’s
achievements and implementation of recommendations developed in strategic documents—
Strategic Plan for Rationalization of Health Facilities of the Republic of Tajikistan for 2011-
2020 and Program for Development of Human Resources in the Health Sector of the Republic
of Tajikistan for 2011-2015—remains now with the Ministry of Health, the report will serve
as an excellent reference document to follow up on the progress of health care reforms in
Tajikistan.?.




86
  The draft ICR was shared with SDC and SIDA for review and comments when additional survey
data and information provided by the Ministry of Health had largely been reflected in the document
and, as a result, the overall outcome rating upgraded to Moderately Satisfactory.
