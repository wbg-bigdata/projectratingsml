INDONESIA
APPRAISAL OF
FOURTH IRRIGATION REHABILITATION PROJECT
SUMMARY AND CONCLUSIONS
i.        Indonesia is a net importer of rice, her staple food, and the
principal aim of the current First Five-Year Plan is to ensure self-suffi-
ciency in rice by 1975. The main components of this policy have been the
support of rice prices, the rehabilitation of irrigation systems which
suffered serious deterioration from lack of maintenance works over the last
30 years, and the expansion of agricultural support services.
ii.       Since 1969, the Association has made nine credits (totalling
US$110 million) in the agricultural sector, three of which (US$38 million)
are for the rehabilitation of irrigation systems. This report appraises
the fourth rehabilitation project.
iii.      The proposed project is composed of three parts:  Part A, rehabili-
tation and improvement of the Pekalen-Sampean Irrigation systems which serve
229,000 ha of an important rice producing area in East Java; Part B, ground-
water investigation of the Sragen area (900 km2) in the Upper Solo Basin,
and of the Madiun valley (1,600 km2) for future development of supplemental
water supplies for increasing yields and production of crops, mainly food
grain and Part C, feasibility studies for future projects.
iv.       Works under Part A include desilting of canals; repairing of
canal banks and structures; and replacing of brushwood checks and drops in
tertiaries with permanent structures. Part B works include a study of
surface and subsurface geology and hydrology; geoelectric surveys, test
holes and test wells to determine the groundwater potential; and comparative
studies of the other means of developing additional water supplies (storage
reservoirs and pumping from rivers) vis-a-vis groundwater development.
v.        The estimated project costs are US$23.4 million, $20.2 million
of which would be for Part A, $2.2 million for Part B and $1.0 million for
Part C. The foreign costs component of Part A are low (32% or $6.5 million)
while those of Parts B and C are high (68% or $1.5 million for B and 87% or
$0.9 million for C).
vi.       Apart from consultants ($3.6 million), the main foreign exchange
requirements would be for the purchase of equipment and vehicles, all of
which would be subject to international competitive bidding. The civil
works consist of a large number of small individual jobs scattered over 139
irrigation systems, and each must be scheduled to minimize interference with
irrigation and farming. Most of the works would be labor-intensive by
nature and in many instances the exact scope of the rehabilitation cannot
be specified in advance. International competitive bidding would not be
appropriate for such works. Procurement procedures would therefore be
similar to those agreed under Credit 220-IND, i.e., works would be awarded
after local competitive bidding among prequalified contractors.



- ii -
v:Li.     The Directorate General of Water Resources Development would
execute the project. Part A would be implemented by PROSIDA, an executive
body which is already responsible for two IDA-assisted projects (Credits
127-IND and 220-IND). Parts B and C would be administered by the Groundwater
Group and the Director of Irrigation respectively. Consultants would be
engaged to assist each group.
viLii.    Part A of the project would increase Indonesia's annual output of
riLce by about 150,000 tons, of soybeans 40,000 tons, and of maize 30,000
tons. This would be equivalent to a gross annual foreign exchange saving of
about US$11 million on rice imports, and increased gross export earnings of
about US$6 million per year from soybeans and maize. The rate of return on
this part of the project would be about 39% and would remain acceptable
despite delay or over-run in construction cost.
ilX.      Part B of the project is an essential step towards an investment
program.  If successful, it could lead to large scale development projects
and benefits would accrue from the provision of an assured water supply
wlhich would greatly raise crop production, thus raising the living standards
o3' the farmers.
xc        Part C of the project would help finance feasibility studies for
two additional irrigation projects, the first for a new irrigation system
and the second for further rehabilitation with surface water storage,
providing dry season irrigation as well as flood control.
xi.       The project is suitable for a Credit of US$12.5 million equivalent
on usual IDA terms. As in previous IDA rehabilitation projects in Indonesia,
the Credit would contribute 50% (US$10 million) of the costs of Part A and,
in addition, would cover foreign exchange costs (US$2.5 million) of Parts
B and C. The balance of finance would be provided by the Government. The
Borrower would be the Government of Indonesia.

APPRAISAL OF
FOURTH IRRIGATION REHABILITATION PROJECT
I. INTRODUCTION
1.01      The Government of Indonesia (GOI) has requested an IDA Credit of
US$12.5 million to assist in financing a fourth rehabilitation project com-
prising:
(a) rehabilitation and improvement of the Pekalen-Sampean
irrigation systems, which serve an important rice
producing area in East Java;
(b) a groundwater investigation in the Upper Solo and
Madiun Valleys for the development of supplemental
water supplies for water scarce areas; and
(c) feasibility studies for two future irrigation projects.
1.02      The Association has made 17 credits to Indonesia totalling
US$231 million, of which nine are in the agricultural sector, amounting
to US$110 million, including three credits for rehabilitation of irrigation
systems. The First Irrigation Rehabilitation Credit (127-IND:US$5 million:
September 1968) financed purchase and operation of equipment for rehabilitation
of the Rentang, Tjisedane and Glapan-Sedadi irrigation systems in Java and
completion of a new system, Way Seputih, in South Sumatra (Map 1). It also
provided for Consultants (Harza, USA) to prepare feasibility reports for
further irrigation rehabilitation projects. The second (195-IND:US$18.5
million:June 1970), provided assistance for rehabilitation of the Djatiluhur
project in West Java. The third Credit (220-IND:US$14.5 million:November
1970), helped to finance rehabilitation at Tjiudjung and Pemali-Tjomal in
Java and Sadang in South Sulawesi.
1.03      The First and Third Irrigation Rehabilitation projects (Rehab I
and III) are administered by Projek Irigasi IDA (PROSIDA), a unit of
the Directorate-General of Water Resources Development (DGWRD), Ministry of
Public Works and Electric Power (MPWEP). An autonomous agency, Otorita
Djatiluhur, was created to administer the rehabilitation of the multipurpose
Djatiluhur project (Rehab II).
1.04      Works on Rehab I are proceeding well and disbursements are on
schedule. Rehab II was declared effective on December 31, 1970, the three-
month delay being due to difficulties in establishing the Authority. All
civil works in the project were to be carried out under about five contracts,
awarded after international bidding. However, because the Authority was
unable to prepare the necessary tender documents in time, the Association
agreed (March 1971) that the 1971/72 program could be carried out under eight
small contracts, of which the first two amounting to 15% of the value of the
eight could be awarded after local bidding. Because of these delays,



d:Lsbursements are behind schedule but all eight contracts have now been
awarded 1/ and it is expected that disbursements will increase. Effectiveness
of Rehab III was delayed by two months - until May 28, 1971 - because of
d:Lfficulty in recruiting expatriate advisers. Planning and design are
progressing satisfactorily, and construction is now in progress and disburse-
ments have started.
1.05      This present project (Rehab IV) would, with Rehab I and III,
increase to 630,000 ha the area to be rehabilitated by PROSIDA. It differs
from previous projects in that Pekalen-Sampean is not one irrigation
unit but comprises many small systems spread over 15,000 km2 and because it
would include upgrading of the systems where practicable and justified.  The
piroject also includes technical assistance for a groundwater investigation
to be,administered by a groundwater group within DGWRD. UNDP have stated
that they have no objection to GOI requesting that the Association finance
this part of the project.
1.06      This report is based on the findings of an appraisal mission led
by Mr. K. Pranich, which visited Indonesia during July and August 1971.
Messrs. M. Burer, A. Stapleton and H. J. Tennent were responsible for
appraisal of the rehabilitation project, and Mr. H. R. McDonald and Mr. P. W.
Whitford for the groundwater.
II. BACKGROUND
2.01      General.  Indonesia is an archipelago of more than 3,000 islands
sitretching along the equator for some 5,000 km. The total land area of
about 1.9 million km2 supports a population of some 124 million which is
imcreasing at about 2.6% per year. The distribution of population and
natural resources among the various islands is very uneven, and the island
oE Java, covering only 7% of the total land area, supports almost 70% of
the total population. Agriculture accounts for more than half of the
national income and provides a livelihood for about 75% of the population.
Rice imports are now down to 540,000 tons annually. The current five-year
p.Lan aims at self-sufficiency in rice by 1975 but this may be difficult to
achieve. Exports, derived mainly from mining, forestry and estate crops,
are estimated at $1,364 million in FY72. The per capita income is presently
estimated at US$75-100 and the five-year plan presumes a growth rate in this
value of 2.3% per annum. There is almost no data on income distribution,
but it is believed to be more uniform than in other developing countries of
similar size and stage of growth.
2.02      Agricultural Development in Java.  Although 75% of the cultivated
area of Java is devoted to food production, the island is not yet self-
sufficient in rice. Most irrigated land grows at least one paddy crop each
year, during the wet season, but production in the dry season is limited by
the amount of water available from unregulated river flows and the few
existing storage reservoirs. Where enough irrigation water is available in
1/   All to local contractors.



- 3 -
the dry season, it is almost invariably used for a second crop of paddy.
Other crops, such as maize, soybeans, tobacco, and vegetables, are generally
grown only with residual moisture or with small amounts of supplemental
irrigation and yields are very low.
2.03      Agricultural Support Programs.  Since 1966 the Government has
pursued an active program of agricultural development, directed primarily
at increasing production of rice. The main components of this policy have
been support of rice prices through the introduction of floor and ceiling
prices; rehabilitation of irrigation systems that have been allowed to fall
into disrepair; and expansion of agricultural support services through the
introduction of BIMAS and INMAS, a package of agricultural inputs (Annex 3).
The impact of these Government programs has been considerable. The production
of rice rose from 9 million tons in 1967 to 11.6 million tons in 1970.
2.04      With assistance from IDA Credit 246-IND, the Government is
establishing a modern seed industry which will produce 22,000 tons per year
of high yielding, certified rice seed to serve the whole of Indonesia.
Under the PUSRI Fertilizer Expansion project (Credit 193-IND), more fertilizers
will be produced and distributed to farmers.
2.05      Irrigation and Drainage.  Irrigation systems in Indonesia are
classified into "technical" and "semi-technical". Technical systems have
permanent control structures at the headworks and on primary and secondary
canals while semi-technical systems have no permanent headworks, and canal
structures of brushwood and cobblestones are washed away every time there
is a large flood.
2.06      Irrigation and drainage systems, technical and semi-technical,
throughout Indonesia are generally in very poor condition as a result of
neglected maintenance over the past 30 years. This neglect has been less
pronounced in East Java than elsewhere, but even so structures have deter-
iorated and canals silted, causing inadequate control of water and poor timing
of agricultural operations and thus reduced yields especially in the dry
season.
2.07      MPWEP is responsible for the construction and rehabilitation of
large-scale works of national importance (Special Projects). In most provinces
the Public Works Department (PWD) is responsible for the construction, and
operation and maintenance (O&M) of all other irrigation systems from the
source of water down to the secondary canals. However, in East Java, the
Irrigation Service (ISEJ) reports directly to the Governor, and this has
been the major factor leading to the better condition of the irrigation
systems in this province. Traditionally, farmers are responsible for the
construction and O&M of the tertiary canals down to farm turnouts. Communal
work is organized by village officials, responsible through the district and
provincial governments to the Ministry of Internal Affairs.
2.08      Agricultural Taxation.  Public agricultural services are financed
from the proceeds of a land tax (IPEDA) levied throughout Indonesia, which
is based on a land classification prepared in the 1930's. In East Java,
this tax is in the range of Rp 3-4,000 per ha per year. Recent efforts to



- 4 -
sitrengthen the collection of this tax have had considerable success in the
project area, and revenues have doubled in the past few years. Road main-
t:enance, schools and mosques obtain the major share of revenues and the
anmount allocated to O&M of irrigation systems is hopelessly inadequate. In
addition to IPEDA, farmers contribute to village development funds and pay
directly, in cash or kind, for the O&M of irrigation systems at the tertiary
:Level and below through village organizations.
2.09      Groundwater Resources.  There has been no systematic investigation
of the groundwater potential in Indonesia. Prior to 1940, some wells were
sunk by sugar plantations and in urban areas for domestic use but groundwater
resources have not yet been widely exploited for irrigation. In 1969 the
Bank engaged a consultant to make a reconnaissance survey of potential
groundwater areas in Java. Later, the Consultants for Rehab I (Harza, USA)
engaged under Technical Assistance Credit 135-IND to formulate a groundwater
iLnvestigation program, recommended a groundwater program for the Upper Solo
and Madiun valleys.
2.10      In 1969, GOI engaged P.N. Waskita Karya, a government-owned
contracting firm, to carry out geologic and geophysical studies in the
Miadiun and Upper Solo areas. The studies, though completed, were not of
sufficient scope to ascertain the potential for large scale development. In
April 1971 a contract for a similar study for the Pemali-TJomal area was
awarded by GOI to the same firm. This study is still in progress.
2.11      Another groundwater study has been conducted in connection with
the Kali Progo basin study (Sir MacDonald & Partners, UK) and a pilot project
is planned under the British assistance program.
III. THE PROJECT AREA
A. The Pekalen-Sampean Irrigation Systems
3.01      General.  The project area comprises 139 small  irrigation systems
in five areas covering 229,100 ha spread over 15,000 km in East Java:
(roup           Irrigation District           No. of Systems        Area - ha
A                 Lumadjang                      32                32,800
B                 Bondowoso                      39                39,300
C                 Lumadjang                      21                46,300
D                 Bondowoso                      18                49,000
E                 Banjuwangi                     29                61,700
Total         139               229,100
3.02      Climate.  The Indonesian climate is tropical and temperatures vary
only a few degrees around the annual average of 26°C. Rainfall is monsoonal,
80% of the annual precipitation falling in the northwest monsoon - November
t:hrough May - while rainfall in the dry season is inadequate for cropping.
In the project area, rainfall varies considerably, from only 475 mm in the



-5-
coastal part of area "B" to over 3,000 mm in the inland part of area "D"
(Annex 2).
3.03      Topography and Soils.  The area is characterized by irregular
clusters of high and active volcanoes, sloping abruptly towards the irrigated
coastal plains. The head reaches of rivers flow in deep ravines, which
become shallow and wide near the coast.
3.04      Reconnaissance soil surveys of the project area were conducted by
the Indonesian Soils Research Institute in 1962 and 1970. Soils are alluvial
with good texture, and suitable for rice, sugarcane and various upland crops.
Because of their volcanic origins, the soils are fertile but crops respond to
nitrogen and phosphorus fertilizers.
3.05      Crops, Production and Yields.  During the wet season, rice is the
predominant crop although sugarcane is also grown on a 14-1/2 month rotation
on about 8% of the area. In the dry season, a second rice crop is grown
where there is sufficient irrigation water but otherwise one or two "polowidjo "
(secondary) crops are grown. These include soybeans, maize, tobacco, onions,
chillies, sweet potatoes, peanuts and cassava. The overall annual cropping
intensity within the project area, with under-irrigated polowidjo crops giving
very low yields, averages about 210% (Annex 1).
3.06      Due to good soils, relatively low population and the high level of
skill of the farmers, East Java is a food surplus area; about 10% of the total
rice production, which reached 2 million tons in 1970, was exported to other
parts of Indonesia. Present production of the project area is estimated
at 970,000 tons of dry stalk paddy 1/, 62,000 tons of soybeans, 42,000 tons
of maize and 1.6 million tons of sugarcane. The average yield of 3.3 tons/ha
dry stalk paddy compares favorably with the national average of 2.7 tons/ha.
Yields of polowidjo crops (soybeans 600 kg/ha and maize 900 kg/ha) are low
because rainfall is inadequate and because they are almost always under-
irrigated. Yields of sugarcane average 90 tons per ha with a sugar to cane
ratio of only 9% compared to world levels of about 12%.
3.07      Existing Irrigation and Drainage.  The 139 separate irrigation
systems are served by 170 headworks and weirs (Maps 3 to 7). The largest
single system is 17,700 ha, but some are less than 500 ha. Drainage is
effected through numerous rivers and streams which flow through the areas.
3.08      Irrigation systems are gravity run-of-the-river systems with
headworks or weirs to raise the level and divert water into networks of
canals. All have deteriorated in varying degrees. Gates and hoisting
devices in most structures need replacement and all canals need desilting and
bank repair. The ISEJ has kept up the operation of the systems quite well
but, because of lack of funds, has not been able to carry out essential main-
tenance and repair.
1/   Stalk paddy consists of the rice panicle, cut off by hand, with about
15-20 cm of stalk attached. When dry, it converts to about 46%
milled rice by weight.



3.09      Farmers are industrious and respond to improved techniques and
inputs. They have maintained tertiary and quaternary canals to a certain
extent but some need rehabilitation and all need permanent control structures
to replace the brushwood checks and drops. If properly distributed and
controlled, water would be ample for paddy in the wet season but polowidjo
crops are grossly under-irrigated. The Ulu-Ulu 1/ system of water management
works reasonably well.
3.10      Farm Size and Land Tenure.  E st Java has a population of about
27 million with a density of 560 per km . Per capita income averages about
US$80 per year. In the project area, the average farm family consists of
al)out 5.7 persons and the average farm size is 1.4 ha. Approximately 45%
oiE the farms are less than one ha in size, 30% between one and two ha, and
25% are more than two ha. Few farms are larger than five ha. Most farms
consist of more than one parcel of land but fragmentation is not extreme
and does not present a major problem.
3.11      There are about 163,000 farmers in the area.  Most farmers (more
than 80%) own their own land. The remainder farm under tenancy agreements
based on share-cropping (mostly on a 50-50 basis) or cash payments, or a
combination of the two. Larger farmers commonly engage laborers to work a
specific area of land in return for one-fifth of the crop. Most cultivation
it by hand but draft animals are used for plowing paddy land. Most of the
land for sugarcane (about 18,000 hectares) is rented from farmers for 16
months by the State-owned sugar factories: the cash payment in 1971 was
Rp 70,000 per ha.
3.12      Agricultural Support Programs.  Farmers in East Java have responded
well to the incentives and support programs described in para 2.03:  more
than 75% use fertilizers and 40% use improved rice varieties. However,
outside of the BIMAS program, the provincial extension service is weak.
There is generally one officer in each Ketjamatan (sub-district) to serve
about 3,000 farmers (see para 5.07). Extension work is hampered by lack
of funds, transport vehicles and the low educational standard of the field
workers, though dissemination of information through printed matter and radio
broadcasts is increasing.
3.13      Marketing, Credit and Storage.  Although East Java is a rice
surplus area, about 20% of the farmers in the project area have no
marketable rice surplus while about 50% sell less than 500 kg per year
of dry stalk paddy. The national rice purchasing agency, BULOG, buys
from rice mills any surpluses over local requirements. Existing milling
capacity considerably exceeds present production.
3.14      BIMAS, which serves 35-40% of farmers in the project area, provides
credit for a package of agricultural inputs and a cost of living allowance
in cash. This credit of Rp 8,000 to Rp 13,000 per ha must be repaid in cash
i,f  A water-master in charge of the allocation of irrigation water to
farmers' fields from tertiary canals.



-7-
within seven months. Except for the few larger farmers who can obtain credit
from the Bank Rakjat Indonesia, there is no institutional credit outside of
the BIMAS program. The cooperative movement has not been effective and
farmers have to meet other credit needs from merchants, money lenders, or
paddy traders. In East Java, however, credit does not appear to be a major
bottleneck in the adoption of improved techniques, such as new seeds, fer-
tilizers and pesticides, as the use of these inputs considerably exceeds the
availability of institutional credit. However, there does appear to be a
shortage of consumer credit which obliges farmers to enter into private
trading agreements and sell paddy at unfavorable prices.
3.15       BULOG operates several warehouses in the project area and most
rice mills have storage capacity. Some villages have communal storage
but most farmers have space in their homes or barns to store crops. While
the storage capacity of the area is adequate even for future levels of
production, its quality is poor and there are losses from rats and weather
damage. Lack of adequate facilities for drying is also a problem.
3.16       Transportation.  Farm-to-market transportation is largely by
hand carrying, bicycles or animal carts. The road network (over 20 km
per 100 km2) is more than adequate for the present volume and kind of
agricultural production. A railway line passing through the project area
connects with Probolinggo, Banjuwangi, Surabaja and other centers but produce
from the project area is carried by road to Surabaja or Banjuwangi for on-
ward shipment by truck or ship to other parts of Indonesia.
B. Groundwater Investigation
3.17       The investigation would be carried out in two densely populated
contiguous areas; Sragen (900 km2) in the Upper Solo Valley in Central Java
and in the Madiun Valley (1,600 km2) in East Java. Both these areas ex-
perience severe water shortages not only in the dry season but frequently
during the wet season if the monsoon rains are late. The resulting delay
in planting causes crops to mature towards the end of the monsoon season
when intense rainfall frequently occurs in the upper reaches of the water-
shed causing floods downstream. These floods destroy crops which are almost
ready for harvest.
3.18       Much of the Sragen area has no irrigation and depends on monsoon
rains for the production of rice on the lowlands and cassava and maize on
the uplands. The only available dry season water supplies are obtained by
rope and bucket from shallow dug wells which are frequently destroyed by
floods. Melons, maize, onions and chillies are grown and irrigated in this
manner in small areas. The Madiun Valley is irrigated but also experiences
severe dry season water shortages. Dry season crops, mostly soybeans and
maize, are often not harvested because yields are too low to compensate for
the work required. In both areas, the average farm size is very small, less
than 1 ha, and the majority of farms are owner-operated. Both areas have
adequate road networks, marketing and storage facilities.

IV. THE PROJECT
4.01      The project consists of three parts which would be executed by separ-
alte agencies in the DGWRD:
Part A    Rehabilitation and improvement of the Pekalen-Sampean
irrigation systems (229,100 ha) to increase production
of rice and other crops and provision of improved
services to ensure that the efficiency of the systems
is maintained. PROSIDA would execute this part.
Part B    An investigation of the groundwater resources and
alternative sources of supplementary water, in the Upper
Solo and Madiun Valleys to determine the most economical
method of increasing water supplies for agricultural
production in these water-scarce areas. This part would
be executed by the Groundwater Group in the Directorate
of Planning and Programing in DGWRD.
Part C    Feasibility studies for (a) a new irrigation system
(15,000 ha) at Sampean Baru in East Java, (b) a rehabili-
tation project (85,000 ha) in Tjirebon area, and (c)
surface water storage and flood control on the Tjimanuk
River to provide dry season irrigation in West Java.
These studies will be administered by the Director of
Irrigation in DGWRD.
A - The Pekalen-Sampean Irrigation Systems
The Project Works
4.02      Part A of the project would include rehabilitation of existing
systems and upgrading of selected semi-technical systems whierever justified
(about 12,000 ha). It would include provision of consultants, an agricultural
extension adviser, and staff training. Equipment and vehicles would be
provided for construction and O&M and for agricultural extension workers.
major works (Annex 4) would include:
(a) rehabilitation of headworks and weirs in the Pekalen-
Sampean irrigation systems;
(b) desilting of primary and secondary canals and repair of
canal structures; repairs to canal banks, including
sodding as erosion protection and construction of step-
landings to control access for domestic purposes- and
construction of buffalo wallow ponds on primary and
secondary canals;
(c) rehabilitation of the first 50 m of tertiary canals,
construction of permanent structures on tertiaries and
head gates for quaternaries;



- 9 -
(d) rehabilitation of flood and lava control levees;
(e) repair of inspection roads and bridges; and
(f) upgrading semi-technical to technical irrigation systems
wherever justified.
4.03      Most of the works would be implemented by labor-intensive methods.
For repair to structures, mostly masonry, these would be the only practical
methods. For desilting of canals, experience with Rehab I suggests a
cost of Rp 125/m3 using machines and Rp 150/m3 by manual labor.  Thus the
shadow price of labor would need only to be le8s than 85X of the wage rate
to justify labor intensive methods, from an economic viewpoint. The
degree of under-employment in this area indicates that this is indeed the
case. However, machinery would be employed for desilting large canals
which cannot be shut down without severe interference with crop production.
4.04      The remaining length of tertiary canals mentioned in (c) above, and
all quaternaries would normally be rehabilitated by farmers with guidance
and direction from PROSIDA and the appropriate local authorities. Assurances
were obtained during negotiations that if farmers fail to carry out this
work, GOI would complete the rehabilitation, or cause it to be completed,
within 12 months after the completion of the first 50 m of each tertiary; and
that PROSIDA would arrange for construction of all controls needed in the
tertiaries and the head gates of quaternaries as permanent structures.
4.05      Consulting Services.  Because of the serious shortage of planning
and design capability in Indonesia, consultants would be required. ISEJ
has already started some rehabilitation (Annex 4) and GOI intends that
PROSIDA should start operations in the area during the 1972 dry season. To
meet this schedule consultants must begin work no later than April 1972.
The consultants would provide engineering services during pre-construction
and implementation and would prepare the feasibility study for Sampean Baru.
Draft terms of reference are contained in Annex 5. The consultants would
prepare plans, designs, specifications and contract documents and would
supervise construction work. About 36 man-years would be required at a cost
of about US$2.0 million. Assurances were obtained during negotiations that
consultants acceptable to the Association would be appointed om-terms and
conditions satisfactory to the Association.
4.06      In order to build up Indonesian expertise in planning, design and
O&M, the consultants would arrange for sending six senior PROSIDA engineers
for training and study tours of irrigation projects abroad.
4.07      Water Quality, Supply and Demand.  Recent tests of samples taken
from several canals showed the waters to be of good quality, suitable for
irrigation and for domestic purposes. Water supplies are generally more
than adequate during the wet season. However, because of the deterioration
of the systems, which affects water control and distribution and causes
large wastage, most of the areas suffer from water shortages in the dry
season. Soybeans and maize grown as second and third crops are presently



- 10 -
irrigated up to only 50-602 of their water requirement. With rehabilitation,
irrigation efficiency would bo Increased and there would be less water
wastage. However, even with higher Irrigation efficiency, only about 205%
cropping intensity could be fully irrigated, as compared to the present
intensity of 210X with under-irrigated crops. Details of water requirements
and supply are given In Annex 6.
4.08      The many rivers and streams in the project areas generally flow in
deep ravines and provide adequate drainage. There is no prolonged flooding
but due to the nature of the terrain and the tropical rainfall, some areas
suffer from flash floods of two to eight hours' duration. In such areas,
towns and agricultural land are usually protected by levees; some of these
also provide protection from lava flows. These levees would be rehabilitated
utnder the project.
4.09      Construction Schedule.  In order that construction could commence
in 1972, consultants must be appointed by April 1972 (para 4.05). It is
unlikely that new equipment can be delivered in time to make a contribution
to the 1972 works but procurement would be initiated by July 1972. The
consultants feasibility report suggested that construction period should be
siLx years but GOI proposes to complete construction by December 1976, i.e.
in five years. The Assoclation agrees that this timetable (shown in Annex
7) is realistic provided the above deadlines are met: however, any delays
would mean that work would not be completed until the 1977 dry season. Such
a delay would have only a minor effect on project benefits (para 7.03).
B. Groundwater Investisation
4.10      The investigation would include a study of surface and subsurface
geology and hydrology. Geoelectric surveys and electric borehole logging
would be used to determine the occurrence and extent of aquifers. Two
drilling rigs would be adequate for the expected drilling program, i.e.,
211 deep (200-400 m) test holes and 12 test wells. Successful wells would
be converted into production wells. Availability of shallow groundwater
would be investigated by the construction of three different kinds of
shallow (about 10 m) wells -- at least 20 dug wells, 20 dug and bored wells
and 4 well batteries. The studies would compare other means of developing
dry-season water supplies, including any potential surface reservoirs and
pumping from rivers, streams and drains (Annexes 4 and 5).
4.11      Experience has shown (para 2.10) that, because of lack of experience
in Indonesia of groundwater development, consultants should be appointed to
conduct the investigation. No suitable drilling rigs are available and the
project provides for purchase of two rigs by DGWRD but, following the normal
Indonesian procedure, operation of the rigs and installation of wells would
be sub-contracted to competent local firms.
4. 12     Consultants, acceptable to the Association, would be appointed by
April 1972 and drilling would start in June 1973 and continue through May
15174. Construction of shallow wells would start about April 1973, and con-
tinue until October 1973. Testing and evaluation would continue until the



- 11 -
consultants' contract expires in March 1975. Draft terms of reference for
the consultants are contained in Annex 5. The project includes overseas
training of selected Indonesian engineers in the investigation, planning,
design and management of groundwater projects; the consultants would organize
this training.
C. Feasibility Studies
4.13      The feasibility studies cover two separate areas.  Sampean Baru
(15,000 ha) is a new irrigation system in East Java (Map 4), actually started
and later discontinued during the Second World War. It will provide irri-
gation to land at present only growing rainfed crops.
4.14      The Tjirebon area (85,000 ha) in West Java (Map 1) lies between
Rentang (being rehabilitated under Rehab I) and Pemali-Tjomal (being rehabi-
litated under Rehab III). Rehabilitation of this area will close the gap in
these projects along the northern coast of Java. The Tjimanuk River runs
through the Rentang area and construction of surface water storage in its
basin would provide dry season water to both Rentang and Tjirebon, benefitting
a total area of 175,000 ha. Storage would also provide flood control and
hydro-power in the area.
4.15      Consultants would be required for these studies.  They would be
appointed by July 1972 and complete their work by August 1973.
D. Cost Estimates and FinancinR
4.16      Cost Estimates.  The estimated cost of Pekalen-Sampean
rehabilitation would be US$20.2 million. The cost of rehabilitation works
is difficult to estimate as a large part of the structures and canals are
under water at all times. In this case, PROSIDA and their consultants
selected representative systems in each area. Actual measurements of silt
and detailed estimates for typical structures were made to develop costs per
ha for canals and average costs for structures, using unit prices based on
experience in current projects. Annex 8 shows the detailed estimates for
Pekalen-Sampean rehabilitation, the groundwater investigation and the feasi-
bility studies. These are summarized below:

- 13 -
4.17      Because of the uncertainties of rehabilitation works, physical
contingencies averaging about 13% have been added. An allowance has also been
made for price escalation calculated on the year-end balance at an annual
rate of 5% for foreign and 6% for local costs.
4.18      Financing.  Previous IDA credits for irrigation rehabilitation
in Indonesia have contributed 50% of the total cost of the project. This
would be satisfactory for the rehabilitation part of the project, which has
a foreign exchange component of 32%. However, the proposed credit would
cover all foreign costs of the groundwater part (68%) and the feasibility
studies (87%). Thus, IDA would contribute about 53% of overall cost of the
project: of the IDA credit, 71% would be used for foreign exchange costs and
29% for local costs.
4.19      The financing plan would be as follows:

Foreign costs, 100% of requirement          3,670         8.9

5,180       12.5
GOI Contribution
Local costs, 75% of requirement             4,490        10.9
9,670       23.4
4.20      Procurement and Contracts.  Equipment, vehicles and drilling rigs
(Annex 9), costing about US$2.6 million, would be procured after international
competitive bidding. Bona fide local manufacturers would be allowed a pre-
ference of 15% or the prevailing custom duty whichever is lower. Consultants
for Parts A, B and C would be appointed in accordance with IDA Guidelines.
Because of the small number of test holes and wells; because the sites are
widely scattered; and because the rate of work is dictated by the require-
ments of the investigators, international bidding would not be appropriate
for well drilling and the Part B consultants would subcontract drilling to
competent local firms. Similarly, the need for casings, pumps and other
materials required to bring successful test wells into production cannot be
estimated in time to allow international bidding and the Part B consultants
would purchase these supplies, which will not cost more than $230,000
(Annex 5), as agents for Government.
4.21      The civil works (estimated to cost US$8.6 million) consist of a
large number of small individual jobs scattered over the 139 systems. In
many instances, the exact scope of rehabilitation works cannot be specified
in advance. Some of the works are seasonal and each job must be scheduled to
minimize interference with farming and to suit irrigation schedules. Interna-
tional competitive bidding would not be appropriate for such works. Procure-
ment procedures, therefore, would be similar to those agreed under Credit
220-IND, i.e., jobs would be grouped into contracts of at least US$15,000
equivalent which would be awarded after competitive bidding, and in the case
of contracts of US$75,000 or over, prequalification will be required. Since
the size of the civil works contracts is not likely to be attractive to foreign
bidders, advertisements would be limited to local newspapers. Procedures for
procurement of equipment (para 4.18) and civil works were agreed during nego-
tiations.



- 14 -
4.22      Disbursement.  Disbursements would cover 100% of the cif cost of
imported equipment and the foreign exchange cost of consultants, the
adviser and training. Disbursements for locally assembled or manufactured
equipment would be a percentage (presently estimated at 95%) of the
ex-factory price including sales tax; for civil works contracts, a
percentage (presently estimated at 44%) of monthly progress payments as
certified by the consultants. No disbursements would be made against
operation and maintenance, work orders for small or emergency jobs or admi--
nistration and overhead. Subject to the approval of the Association, savings
could be utilized to carry out further works related to the purposes of the
project.
4.23      Under the present work schedule, annual expenditures of the IDA
Credit and GOI contribution to the project are estimated to be as follows:

4.24      Accounts and Audit.  PROSIDA would maintain a separate account
for Pekalen-Sampean rehabilitation and would carry out internal audits.
The DGWRD would do likewise for the groundwater investigation and feasibility
studies. In Rehab I and III the Directorate General of Government Financial
Control has been accepted as the auditor. Although the audits for Rehab I
are behind schedule, steps have been taken to improve the situation. PROSIDA,
Rmoreover, has now engaged an administration and financial adviser under
Rehab III. GOI has agreed that the project accounts would be
audited annually by the Directorate General of Government Financial Control,
aind that copies of the audit would be sent to the Association within four
months of the closing date of the Indonesian fiscal year (April 1-March 31).

V. ORGANIZATION AND MANAGEMENT
A. The Pekalen-Sampean Irrigation Systems
5.01      Rehabilitation.  In April 1969, MPWEP issued a decree creating
PROSIDA as a "Special Project" under the DGWRD to implement Rehab I (Figure
I). Later, in April 1970, PROSIDA was also given responsibility for Rehab
III. MPWEP has recently issued a decree, the terms of which are acceptable
to the Association, giving PROSIDA responsibility for Pekalen-Sampean area.
Inter alia, the decree establishes the organization shown in Figure II,
which includes a full-time PROSIDA engineer to deputize for the manager, who
is the head of ISEJ.
5.02      Section 3.07 of the Development Credit Agreement 220-IND required
that PROSIDA would not engage in any new rehabilitation projects unless the
Association was satisfied that this would not adversely affect the ongoing
projects. Three expatriate advisers have already been appointed to assist
PROSIDA in construction and contracts, operation and maintenance, and finance
and administration. PROSIDA has been doing well in implementing the Rehab I
and III projects. The Rehab I will also be phasing out by the time the
construction work in this project is started. Moreover, the ISEJ, with which
PROSIDA would work in carrying out the rehabilitation, is a strong and
efficient organization. For these reasons, it is considered that PROSIDA is
capable of executing this project and the increased responsibility would not
adversely affect the implementation of the existing Rehab I and III. However,
to ensure that PROSIDA maintains its strength and capability, assurances
were obtained during negotiations that PROSIDA would be headed at all times
by a competent and experienced full-time General Manager; and, before making
any new appointment to this position GOI would inform the Association of
the names, qualifications and experience of the persons being considered for
such appointment and afford the Association a reasonable opportunity to
exchange views on such persons.
5.03      Operation and Maintenance.  O&M is the responsibility of the
ISEJ, which is staffed with experienced engineers and technicians. Although
short of funds during the last 30 years, ISEJ maintained the systems in
operable condition. The project would provide the additional funds necess-
ary for proper O&M during rehabilitation: if the Province does not allo-
cate them GOI would ensure that adequate funds are provided thereafter.
Assurances to these effects were obtained during negotiations.
5.04      After the re-introduction of adequate O&M, it would be necessary
to improve water management at the farm level to obtain full benefits from
the project. The response of project area farmers to new inputs (para 3.12)
leaves little doubt that they will learn the techniques rapidly and apply
them enthusiastically. In order to bring all the people essential to the
running of the irrigation systems together, GOI proposes to re-establish
the Irrigation Advisory Committees at Ketjamatan (sub-district) level
with officials from irrigation, agriculture, local government, and farmers'



- 16 -
representatives as members. As in the case of Credit 220-IND, assurances
were obtained during negotiations that such committees, with satisfactory
terms of reference, would be established within 12 months. Further assurances
were obtained that the Golongan system 1/ of rotating the dry season water
supply would be reinstated as soon as each irrigation system is rehabilitated.
5.05      Field Staff Training.  Reference has been made to overseas
training by consultants of PROSIDA engineers (para 4.06) and ground water
ispecialists (para 4.12). Government has agreed that the Association would
give prior approval to programs, itineraries, cost estimates and the officers
selected for overseas training. The project also includes training of field
staff (Annex 11). HPWEP operates two training institutes - the Bandung
Technical Academy and the Surabaja Training Institute. Formerly, the
Academy gave only formal education in civil and mechanical engineering and
architecture but, since 1969, has provided short refresher courses for irri-
gation sectional officers, sub-sectional officers and construction supervis-
Drs. The Institute concentrates on training of irrigation officials at
sub-sectional level and lower. The numbers admitted is limited by lack of
operating funds: the project includes provision for sending about 350
more irrigation trainees.
5.06      The project also includes refresher courses in modern agricultural
practices for the 125 agricultural extension officers working at the
sub-district level in the project area. These courses would be conducted
by the Directorate General of Agriculture at its training centres. In
addition 12 subject matter specialists would be trained at the Central
Research Institute at Bogor.
5.07      Agricultural Support Programs.  It is unlikely that the number
of agricultural extension officers in the project area could be increased
from the present one per 3,000 farmers to a more appropriate ratio, e.g.
one per 1,000 to 1,500 farmers, in the near future (para 3.12). Given the
present manpower and budgetary constraints, extension work could best be
strengthened by increasing the technical competence and mobility of the
existing extension workers. Altogether 137 motor cycles would be required
for 125 extension officers and 12 subject matter specialists. 16 sets
of audio visual equipment, each set to serve 8 extension officers, would also
be provided. The project also includes an expatriate agricultural extension
adviser to assist the Agricultural Extension Services of the Ministry of
Agriculture in strengthening their activities in the project area. GOI agreed
to engage this adviser within 12 months.
5.08      Roads and Communications.  Road maintenance and improvement programs
are underway in East Java at all levels -- State (with assistance from IDA
Credit 154-IND), provincial and district. These would enable the existing
1/   System of sharing dry season water which is in short supply by means of
rotation, leaving a part of the area out of irrigation each year. This
system, which ensure efficient use and equitable sharing of limited
amounts of dry season water has fallen into disuse in the past 30 years
since the dilapidated systems could not be operated properly (see Annex
1, para 25).



- 17 -
road network to handle future increases in production without difficulty.
Similarly, the increased requirements for transport vehicles could easily
be met by the private sector. A radio-telephone system, which would cost
less than a telephone system of equal efficacy, would provide convenient
communication between each area and the field office at Djember as well as
the project head office in Surabaja.
Recovery of Costs
5.09      The cost of O&M after rehabilitation would be about Rp 1,200 per
ha per year. Recovery of the investment in rehabilitation over 30 years,
would require Rp 1,000 per ha per year without interest on Rp 2,200 with 6%
interest. The total charge required to cover O&M and investment costs
would therefore be Rp 2,200 per ha per year (Rp 3,400 with 6% interest).
5.10      Traditionally, farmers in Indonesia have not paid directly for
capital costs of irrigation systems but have contributed indirectly
through the land tax. At present, farmers pay land taxes (para 2.08)
of Rp 3-4,000 per ha on irrigated land but less than 10% of the revenue
collected by the Province is allocated for O&M of the irrigation systems.
During negotiations, as in Rehab III, GOI agreed to maintain and enforce
legislation authorizing collection of charges on irrigated land, starting
within one year after the rehabilitation of each system. They further
agreed that after two years the level of charges would be sufficient to
cover the operating and maintenance costs.
5.11      The land tax forms a major source of revenue at the provincial
and district levels, and any change in this tax must be considered in the
broader context of overall taxation policy. This question is currently
under review in Indonesia, and Government does not intend to impose new
charges in rehabilitated areas at the present time. However, an overall
increase in the land tax and a revision of land classification are being
considered. The increase in incomes as a result of the project will in-
crease the tax base in the project area, and recovery in full of incremental
O&M and investment costs would amount to only about 10% (16% with interest)
of incremental income. No provision was made in Rehab III for the recovery
of investment costs, since it was argued that, over the past decades, farmers
had paid for maintenance through the land taxes, and that rehabilitation was
only necessary because maintenance services had not been provided. However,
because of the higher levels of farm incomes, and because this project
includes some improvement as well as rehabilitation, it was agreed during
negotiations that GOI would carry out a study of the estimated economic
benefits of Part A of the project including the increase in income of the
farmers and the possibilities and arrangements for mobilization of part of
such increased income for further development.  Upon completion of the study,
about three years from signing of the credit, GOI will consult with Associa-
tion on its conclusions.
B. Groundwater Investigation
5.12      The proposed groundwater investigation would be carried out by
consultants (para 4.11) and would be supervised by a Groundwater Group
already established within the Directorate of Planning and Programming of



- 18 -
thie DGWRD (Figure III).   The Groundwater Group is guided in its work by a
steering committee composed of high-level officials in the DGWRD and the
Geological Survey, Department of Mines.
C. Feasibility Studies
5.13      The proposed feasibility studies will be carried out by consultants
and administered by the Director of Irrigation within DGWRD. In the case
of the Tjimanuk River studies there will be a review of feasibility after
siK month' work.
VI. PRODUCTION, MARKET PROSPECTS AND FARM INCOME
IN THE PEKALEN-SAMPEAN IRRIGATION SYSTEMS
6.01      Production.  At present, many farmers in the project area are
using good quality seeds and fertilizers (para 3.12). With an improvement
in the irrigation facilities, most farmers would undoubtedly use the necessary
inputs to obtain higher yields. For this reason no distinction is made
between BIMAS and non-BIMAS areas in estimating yields.
6.02      After rehabilitation, average yields of dry stalk paddy would
increase from an overall average of about 3.3 to 4.9 ton per ha at full
development as a result of improved control and timeliness of water appli-
cation. However, some increase in yield would also be obtained even without
rehabilitation (from 3.3 to 3.9 ton per ha), due to better seeds and in-
creased use of inputs. For soybeans and maize the situation is different
as they are now irrigated with only about half of their requirements. With-
out rehabilitation they would remain seriously under-irrigated and no improve-
ments would be possible. Hence, the increase in yield from 0.6 ton per ha
to 1.0 ton for soybeans and from 0.9 ton per ha to 2.0 ton per ha for maize
would be attributable entirely to the rehabilitation which would enable the
Golongan system to be reintroduced and would increase irrigation efficiency
in the dry season. Because sugarcane already receives priority in water
supply, no increase over the present production of 140,000 tons sugar is
to be expected as a result of rehabilitation (Annex 12). The estimated
increase in production of the three main crops -- rice, soybeans and maize
at full development in 1982 is shown below:
Estimated Production

/1   Equivalent to about 150,000 tons milled rice.



- 19 -
6.03      Market Prospects.  Indonesia now imports over 500,000 tons of
rice annually, while production in 1970 was estimated at 11.6 million tons,
(para 2.01). Rehabilitation of irrigation systems, combined with price
support for rice and increased use of improved seeds and fertilizers, has
led to a significant increase in rice production, and rice imports are
likely to be greatly reduced over the next few years. However, the rela-
tively high price and income elasticity of demand for rice in Indonesia
coupled with the increasing population, indicates that there would be no
difficulty in absorbing the additional 150,000 tons of rice that would be
produced by the project at full development. Soybeans and maize are exported
to the rapidly growing Japanese market and other East Asian countries.
Market prospects for these two commodities are good.
6.04      Rice Prices.  The Government currently supports the price for
milled rice at Rp 36 per kg ex-mill (ranging to Rp 38 per kg for better
quality grain), equivalent to Rp 14.5 per kg for dry stalk paddy at the
farm-gate. This price is supported only by BULOG purchases at the mill,
however, and the price received by the farmer is frequently below the
official minimum. Rice purchased by BULOG is used to provide rations for
Government services and the armed forces, and is released into the market
only when necessary to keep the retail price below Rp 50 per kg.
6.05      The present retail price of rice, Rp 45 per kg, is equivalent to
about US$108 per ton. This compares with a current world price of about
US$85 per ton f.o.b. Rangoon for 42% broken rice, or about US$100 landed
in Djakarta. The recent devaluation of the rupiah, therefore, has brought
domestic rice prices into line with world levels. These levels are at their
lowest for the past thirty years, and it is unlikely that there will be any
significant further decline in rice prices in the future.
6.06      Farm Income.  Most farming in the project area is basically
subsistence in nature, with rice being grown primarily for family consumption.
Family income consists of sales of surplus rice and, in some cases, other
crops such as soybeans and maize, as well as earnings from off-farm
employment. When labor is hired, on larger farms and at peak periods, payment
is generally in kind.
6.07      The assumptions underlying calculation of the farm budgets are
explained in detail in Annex 13, along with a detailed breakdown of typical
budgets.  Only actual payments, in cash or kind, have been charged as produc-
tion costs, except for family labor for which the cost of family consumption
of rice has been charged. Following existing market practices, surplus
production sold at the time of harvest has been valued at a somewhat
depressed price (Rp 10 per kg for dry stalk paddy).  As the cropping pattern
in the project area involves the choice between three basic rotations (rice/rice,
rice/soybeans or rice/soybeans/maize), (see Annex 1), three typical farm
budgets have been calculated for three different farm sizes in Annex 13.
The effect that the project would have on cash farm incomes of the two most
prevalent cropping patterns -- rice/rice and rice/soybeans is summarized in
the table below:

VII. BENEFITS AND JUSTIFICATION
A. The Pekalen-Sampean Irrigation Systems
7.01      The project would have a favorable impact on the national economy,
on the financial status of the farmers, on income distribution and on employ-
ment.
7.02      Economic Benefits.  At full development in 1982, the project would
increase Indonesia's annual output of milled rice by 150,000 tons, of soybeans,
40,000 tons; and of maize, 30,000 tons. Based on present estimates of future
world commodity prices, this would be equivalent to a gross annual saving
of about US$11 million in foreign exchange on rice imports, and increased
gross export earnings of about US$6 million per year from maize and soybeans.
The project benefits would be realized through more effective use of irrigation
water in both wet and dry seasons, upgrading of selected (about half)
semi-technical irrigation systems and reintroduction of rotation of dry
season water (Golongan system) to ensure its more efficient use.
7.03      It is expected that farmers in the project area would respond quick-
ly to improvements in the irrigation system, and that production would reach
full development in 1982, five years after the completion of construction.
With efficient O&M, the project would have a life of at least 30 years. Based
on projected future world prices for maize and soybeans and a future world
rice price 20% below current levels, the project would have an internal rate
of return of about 39Z. If labor is costed at market rates, the rate of
return would be about 26%. If the period of construction is extended by
two years, there is a construction cost over-run of 10%, benefits are
delayed by an additional two years and incremental crop yields are reduced
by 10%, the rate of return would be 25%. If the above events are combined
with labor costed at market rates, the rate of return would still be 17%.
Even if the project falls short of expectations, therefore, it would still
give an acceptable rate of return (see Annex 14).
7.04      Income and Employment Effects.  The expected increase in farmers'
Income has been shown in para 6.07: under existing price-cost relationships,
there would be adequate incentive for farmers to intensify production and
take advantage of the improved water supply.



- 21 -
7.05      Small paddy farmers, who would be the prime beneficiaries of the
project, form one of the poorest groups in Indonesia. Although data on
personal incomes are not available at a national level, a rough indication
can be gained by comparing the average per capita income (in cash and kind)
of farm families in the project area of US$30 with the national income per
capita for the whole of Indonesia US$75-100 per annum. As a result of the
project, the per capita income of farmers would be raised to about US$45 per
annum which, while still below the national average, constitutes an increase
of about 50%.
7.06      There is surplus labor in the project area and, because of
the small farm size, many farm families are greatly under-employed. The
project would improve this situation in three ways: by providing employment
on the rehabilitation works; by intensifying agricultural production
practices and by increasing employment in secondary industries (drying,
milling, storage, transportation) because of increased overall production.
7.07      Ecology.  The project would improve the farmers' standard of
living and would not adversely affect public health. There is no evidence
of schistosomiasis in the project area. Fertilizers and chemicals are already
used in significant quantities and people are well aware of their toxic
hazards. GOI is preparing legislation restricting application and distri-
bution of chemicals.  Widespread applications of BHC (Benzene-Hexachloride)
against stemborers in rice, however, may also destroy parasitic insects,
which could result in an increase of moth borers, harmful to sugarcane. On
the other hand, it may be expected that the re-introduction of the Golongan
system and the diversification of crops will interrupt the life cycles of
harmful insects and rodents and provide better control of pests and disease.
B. Groundwater Investigation
7.08      The investigation is an essential step towards an investment
program. If successful, it could lead to large-scale development projects
and benefits would accrue from the supplemental water provided to large areas
presently experiencing severe water shortages. The provision of an assured
water supply would greatly raise crop production and thus uplift the living
standard of the farmers. The use of consultants would give training to
Indonesian engineers and technicians, so that they would be able to continue
to develop the new source of water in the future.
C. Feasibility Studies
7.09      The feasibility studies will develop additional projects for
possible IDA financing. These will cover further rehabilitation, a new
irrigation system, and surface water storage. The latter will provide much
needed dry season irrigation and increase cropping intensity over 175,000
ha from 125% to 200%.



- 22 -
VIII. AGREEMENTS REACHED AND RECOMMENDATIONS
8.01      During negotiations agreement was reached on the following principal
points:
(i) PROSIDA will arrange construction as permanent structures of
all controls in the tertiaries and head gates of the quaternaries
(para 4.04);
(ii) the Golongan system of rotating dry season water supplies will
be reinstated (para 5.04);
(iii) GOI will levy charges on beneficiaries within one year after
each system is rehabilitated, and after two years will recover
the full cost of 0 and M (para 5.10); and
(iv) GOI will study economic benefits including farm incomes and
means of mobilizing such increased incomes for future develop-
ment (para 5.11).
8.02      The project constitutes a suitable basis for a Credit of US$12.5
million on usual IDA terms. The borrower would be the Government of Indonesia.
There would be no additional conditions of effectiveness.

INDONESIA
FOURTH IRRIGATION REHABILITATION PROJECT
Agriculture
General
1.        The Pekalen-Sampean project area is located in the Eastern Java.
Its western border, running almost north-south, starts about 60 km east
of the Province's capital, Surabaja, near the town of Probolinggo. The
area is characterized by high volcanic peaks, sloping abruptly towards
coastal plains. It comprises five non-contiguous areas covering about
229,000 ha of alluvial soils and lies in the river valleys. The areas
have gravity irrigation systems, some of which date back to 1883 but most
of which were built during the 1920's.
2.        The climate is tropical with a wet season from November to April
and a dry season from Nay to October.  Annual rainfall ranges from 475 mm
locally in the coastal area to over 3,000 nm inland, 80% falling in the
wet season in short, intense storms over very localized areas. Mean monthly
temperatures vary from 25°C in July to 280 in November. Average annual
evaporation is about 1,000 mm, being highest in September (130 mm) and
lowest in February (60 mm).
3.        There are two distinct groups of crops, "lowland" and "upland"
crops. The "lowland" crops, mostly rice, are irrigated crops, whereas the
"uipland" crops are mainly rainfed, though they may be irrigated whenever
there is water available. Rainfed crops, commonly called "polowidjo"
crops, include : rainfed rice (padi gadu), soybeans, maize, tobacco,
chillies, sweet potatoes, peanuts and cassava.
4.        Agricultural activities center on rice growing principally in the
wet season but also in the dry season whenever irrigation water is available.
Other important crops are soybeans and maize grown by the farmers in the
dry season on residual soil moisture with some supplementary irrigation.
5.        Cropping intensity in the wet season is 100% (rice) while in the
dry season it varies from 44% in areas where only limited irrigation water
is available to 136% where two polowidjo crops are grown, partly rainfed.
Overall cropping intensity of the project area averages about 210%.
Rice
6.        East Java is a rice surplus province and in 1970 exported about
10% of its total production of 4.4 million tons of dry stalk paddy.1/
In contrast to other parts of Java the high yielding varieties (HYV) are
1/   Unthreshed rice in the husk, harvested with 15-20 cm stalk and tied in
bundles.



ANNEX 1
Page 2
cultivated on a significant. scale: about 40% of farmers use improved rice
varieties. The HYV are cross breeds `'etween the Indica and Japonica type
varieties and have the following important characteristics: short-strawed,
non-lodging, photo-insensitive, high response to nitrogenous fertilization,
easy shattering chalky grain, approximately 135 days growing period and
rather sensitive to bacterial blight. They are locally known as: PB-5
(Peta Baru 5), PB-8 and C-4 (Siampat). These HYV are well accepted by the
population and sold and consumed either mixed with the local varieties or
pure.
7.        The traditional local varieties are divided into Tjereh varieties
(mostly non-awned, slightly photo-sensitive, with thin and long grains),
and Bulu varieties (awned, photo-insensitive with more round grains). Most
popular improved traditional varieties are: Bengawan, Syntha, and Dara: their
growing period varies from 140 to 160 days, and they all belong to the
Tjereh group.
8.        Cultivation practices are similar throughout the project area and
in general, there is a good discipline in water management as shown by
fairly large areas with a uniform stand of crops. Soil and nursery prep-
aration starts late November/December; transplanting is in January/February
anad harvesting in April and May.
9.        Nurseries are generally one-tenth of the size of the area to be
p:Lanted. Soil preparation, plowing, hoeing and levelling is done either
by manual labor or with the help of animals. Seed, usually pre-soaked, is
sown at rates of about 25 kg/ha in the fine mud. As the seedlings grow,
water levels are increased to 10 cm. Seedlings of the HYV stay 3 to 4 weeks
in the nursery before transplanting, though in areas with a seriously
deteriorated irrigation system transplanting is often delayed, resulting in
lower yields. Seedlings of the traditional varieties may remain 5 to 6
weeks in the nursery.
10.       Immediately after the nursery is seeded, the field to be planted
is prepared by cutting and burning the straw of the previous crop, repairing
the field dikes, followed by plowing twice and/or hoeing, harrowing twice,
and levelling with wooden implements. When irrigation water is late
the first plowing is done after the first rains. Tillage is mostly performed
by draft animals.
11.       Transplanting is specifically an activity for women.  Seedlings
are pulled out 10 to 20 plants at a time, cleaned of soil, sometimes the
leaves are cut to about half their length and finally they are tied together
in small bundles and transported to the field. Planting distance is 10 to
30 cm in a square. After one week dead seedlings are replaced and the
water level is gradually raised; average water height is 10 to 15 cm for
the HYV and about 25 cm for the traditional varieties.
12.       Weeding is done once or twice, depending on the thoroughness of
soil preparation and the effectiveness of water control to suppress weed



ANNEX 1
Page 3
growth. The first weeding starts 3 to 6 weeks after transplanting. Weeding
is mostly done by women in the standing water and consists of pulling out
the larger weed clusters or pushing the smaller ones with their feet deep
in the mud.
13.       More than three-quarters of farmers in East Java now use fertilizer
in rice production. Fertilizers are applied on the nurseries before
seeding and on the field immediately after soil preparation and after the
first weeding. However, quantities applied are often about half of the
amounts recommended by the Agricultural Extension Service or through the
BIMAS 1/ and INMAS 2/ programs (see Annex 3, para 5). Urea is by far the
most widely used chemical for the smallholders.  Use of phosphatic fertilizers
is much less common.
14.       The main channels for fertilizer distribution are the state
enterprises PN Pertani and PUSRI. Established in 1963, PN Pertani held an
official monopoly as a government fertilizer distributor until 1967, and
it was the sole distributor of urea produced at the state-owned urea factory
PUSRI in Palembang. The relations between the two enterprises, however,
were not good and in 1968/69 PUSRI developed an efficient and extensive
private distribution network. With PUSRI's planned increase of imports it
is expected that it soon will supersede PN Pertani. These imports, which
will reach 200,000 tons in 1972/73, are intended to expand PUSRI's market
in anticipation of plant expansion to be completed in late 1973. By that
time PUSRI's present capacity of 90,000 tons per year will have increased to
480,000 tons of urea per year.
15.       Pests cause more damage to rice crop than diseases.  The main pest
is stemborer, a moth larvae which feeds on the plant tissues and either kills
the seedlings or causes empty panicles. Other serious pests are bugs and
rats; the latter not only damage the crop but also undermine bunds and dikes
and feed on stored paddy. The most common disease is Brown spot
(Helminthosporium oryzae). Common pests and diseases are the following:

literally "mass guidance for self-sufficiency in foodstuffs.
2/   Abbreviation for "Intensifikasi Massal Sewa Samboda Bahan Makanan"

16.       Chemicals to protect rice against pests and diseases are distributed
under BIMAS and INMAS programs but are not so widely used as fertilizers.
A problem is the timely application of the chemicals, due to insufficient
knowtledge on the part of the farmers about the use of chemicals and to the
inadequate supply of spraying equipment. Laws restricting use and distribution
are being drafted.
17.       Harvesting is traditionally done by women who cut each panicle
with a special rice knife: the "ani-ani". It is a generally accepted
principle that those who do the weeding, have the right of harvesting as
well. Normally harvesters are paid in kind, one-fifth of the amount of
s talk paddy that they harvest.
18.       Threshing is done either in the field (particularly the easy
shat:tering PB varieties) or at home by beating the stalk paddy with a stick.
The threshed rice in the husk without stalk is called "gabah". After
winnowing by wind and drying, the gabah is ready for hulling which is done
in small daily quantities at home or in larger amounts at the village huller.
The products after hulling are: the hulls, the bran ("dedek') and the
rice kernels ("beras"). The hulls are discarded, the bran used for feeding
livestock and poultry and the rice is polished before consumption. The
relative weights of the various forms of rice are:

Dry Stalk Paddy         80   - 100
"Paddy Gabah"           66.6 -  83
Milled Rice             37   -  46
19.       Drying facilities are poor particularly for the crops harvested
at the onset of the wet season. Storing is done in the farmer's house, in
the farm yard or in the village rice store ("Lumbung desa"). Most storage
facilities are not rodent-proof, causing considerable losses, and good storage
capacity is generally insufficient. The rice is stored either as dry stalk
paddy or as polished rice. While milling capacity is considerably in excess
of present production, most mills are very old and the percentage of broken
rice is high.
Sugarcane
20.       The project area has about 18,000 ha of sugarcane, the cultivating
and processing of which is managed by Government estates. Land is rented
by the factories from the farmers for 16 months, usually on a rotation of
4 years. Rental for 16 months was recently increased from Rp 50,000
in 1969/70, to Rp 70,000 per hectare. In addition to rent, cash premiums
are given to farmers, as follows:
(a) Rp 1,500/ha if the land is available to the factory
before May;
(b) Rp 2,000/ha if available before April; and
(c) Rp 3,000/ha if available before March.
If the factories are late in returning the land, premiums of Rp 2,500, 5,000
or 7,000 per ha are given for one, two or three months delay, respectively.
All operations are carried out by the factories. Notwithstanding the fact
that a compensation of Rp 70,000 per ha for the loss of one rice and
three polowidjo crops can be considered reasonable to good (see Farm
Budgets: Annex 13) farmers find the rent low and are therefore rather
reluctant to let their land. To meet the farmers demand the factories try
to return the rented land to the owners before August in order to give the
farmers the possibility of one polowidjo crop before preparation for the
wet rice season in November/December.
21.       The sugar estates receive preference in the timing of irrigation
water application but not in the quantity of water. In practice this means
that whenever possible the distribution of irrigation water to the sugar
estates starts in May, when water is needed for the new plantings.
To meet the water demand of the crop, most estates have wells and pumps for
supplementary irrigation. Traditionally the crop is only irrigated during
the dry season, from May to October inclusive.



ANNEX 1
Page 6
22.       Present average sugarcane production in the project area is
approximately 8 ton/ha of refined sugar per crop as compared to 18 tons
before 1940. This deterioration, however, is not due only to insufficient
irrigation. Sugar experts of PNP 1/ XXV gave the following additional
reasons, which are more decisive for the yield than the amount of
irrigation water:
(a) Plant material is not pure;
(b) Farmers tend to let land with lower quality soils instead
of first class land;
(c) Cultivation practices are not carried out correctly;
(d) Transport of the cane to the mills is in many instances
poorly organized and slow, causing losses in sugar content;
(e) Deplorable condition of the mills. Total capacity has decreased
and average output on crystal sugar per unit of cane is only
9%, compared to pre-war rate of 11-12%; and
(f) Poor timing of irrigation supplies.
23.       In view of the above factors affecting yields, it is not anticipated
that increase in yields would be achieved by irrigation rehabilitation alone.
Until the bottlenecks described are eliminated, the increase in produc-
tion should not be taken into account.
Other Crops
24.       After rice and sugarcane, soybeans and maize are the most important
crops grown in the area.  With the onset of the dry season when irrigation
water is not sufficient to grow a second rice crop, soybeans receive the
highest priority for irrigation. This crop is sown without land preparation,
weeded only once and harvested 80 to 90 days later. If rainfall or the
amount of irrigation water available gives any hope of a reasonable third
crop, a 90-day maize crop is sown after superficial land preparation.
In general the supply of irrigation water in the dry season is very small,
hence yields are low.
The Golongan System
25..      The project will ensure the return of the disused Golongan,
a rotation system, which has fallen into disuse because of inadequate
walter control. This is a system of sharing dry season water, which is
always in short supply, by means of rotation of water supply; leaving a part
of the area out of irrigation each year. The re-introduction of the
system will also ensure that the present taxation system is equitable.
TT  PNP = Perusahan Negara PerKehunan (National Agricultural Estate),
which rans the State-owned sugar factories in the project area.



ANNEX 1
Page 7
Yields
26.       Present rice yields in the project area of 3.3 tons dry stalk
paddy per ha in the wet season and 3.1 tons in the dry season compare
favorably with the national average of 2.7 ton/ha. Even without the project,
research on rice will continue and yields, averaged for HYV and local
varieties, may increase to 3.9 tons and 3.4 tons dry stalk paddy per ha in
the wet and dry seasons, respectively. However, with the project, good
water management and continued research on rice culture are expected to
increase average yields to 4.9 tons/ha dry stalk paddy in the wet, and 4.7
ton/ha in the dry, season.
27.       For soybeans and maize which are now grown on residual soil moisture
following the wet season rice crop and/or on additional irrigation, water
is the limiting factor. Yields are about 600 kg dry grains per ha for
soybeans and 900 kg for maize and will remain static unless the project is
undertaken. After rehabilitation of the irrigation systems, the
anticipated yields can easily increase to 1,000 kg/ha for soybeans and
2,000 kg/ha for maize.

FOURTH IRRIGATION REHABILITATION PROJECT
Agriculture Supporting Services
General
1.        The Ministry of Agriculture is sub-divided into five Directorates
General: Agriculture, Forestry, Estates, Animal Husbandry and Fisheries.
The Directorate General of Agriculture is sub-divided into five Directorates
(Planning, Production Development, Agricultural Engineering, Agricultural
Economy and Agricultural Extension) and three Research Organizations
(Agriculture, Horticulture and Soils).
2.        Lower in the organization, the Directorates branch off into a
number of Agricultural Services at provincial, district, sub-district and
village level (Table 1). These services are technically subordinated to
the Ministry of Agriculture, but administratively and particularly as far
as policy considerations are concerned, they fall under the Ministry of
Interior through the Provincial Governor.
Extension Service
3.        All the technical services from provincial level downwards are
engaged in agricultural extension work in one form or another. The senior
official at the provincial level is the Inspector of Agriculture. The
activities of the technical services include:
(a) seed propagation and some applied research;
(b) collection of statistical data;
(c) administration; and
(d) extension, which mainly consists of custom work (spraying
of chemicals for farmers), demonstration by means of
"Demplots" (demonstration plots) and key-farmers, inform-
ation on crop particularities by means of pamphlets and
through the radio, and finally, some rare visits to farmers.
4.        At sub-district level (Ketjamatan level) all the activities are
generally carried out by one man. It is estimated that there are about
1,000 field workers for approximately 3 million farmers in East Java. The
field extension worker's main means of transport is the bicycle.



ANNEX 3
Page 2
5.        Hampered by lack of funds, it is doubtful whether agricultural
extension work can be significantly intensified by appointing more extension
officers. However, the present extension worker could do considerably more
if he could use a motorcycle instead of the slow and exhausting bicycle.
6.        The educational background of the extension workers, particularly
at the lower levels is poor. The Association has negotiated an Agricultural
Education Project which may be expected to improve the training of future
recruits but in-service training is required to improve the standards of
existing staff (Annex 11). The estimated cost of improving agricultural
extension work in the project area (excluding costs of buildings and land
acquisition) is as follows:
Item                      Designation                Cost (Rp)
(a)  Training    125 Sub-district extension officers   7,500,000
12 subject-matter specialists            360,000
(b)  Equipment   137 motorcycles                         22,687,000
16 audio-visual units                  3,974,000
3 four-wheel drive vehicles           3,7269000
Total               38,247,000
7.        GOI requires specialist advice to strengthen the Extension
activities of the Ministry of Agriculture and to ensure that improved
standards continue when rehabilitation is completed. The project includes
appointment of an expatriate adviser on agriculture extension for a period
of 2 years (see Appendix). Without affecting his work on the Pekalen-Sampean
project, this specialist could advise on agricultural extension problems in
Rehabilitation I and III projects as well.
Research
8.        Agricultural research is carried out by the Central Research
Institute for Agriculture (CRIFA) at Bogor, which also manages some twenty
experimental farms throughout Indonesia. CRIFA performs research only for
food crops and small industrial crops. The estates (sugar, tobacco, rubber,
coffee, etc.) have their own research stations, scattered throughout East
Java. For sugarcane, the main research station is at Pasuruan.
BIMAS and INMAS Programs
9.        The BIMAS and INMAS programs are aimed at self-sufficiency in
foodstuffs in general but until now, they have been concentrated only on
rice production. Under the BIMAS program, credit may be obtained for fer-
tilizers, insecticides, spraying equipment, seed and cost of living allowance.
Choice can be made between Package A, worth approximately Rp 12,500 for the



ANNEX 3
Page 3
cultivation of HYV and Package B, worth about Rp 8,000 for local rice
varieties. The interest rate is 1% per month. Packages are as follows:
BIMAS

Package A                  Package B
Rp/ha                     Rp/ha

Cost of Living                       3,500                     3,500
12,512                    8,136
Also special extension services are provided on the basis of one extension
worker per 600 to 1,000 ha.
10.       BIMAS program is available to any one area just for one year.
After one year of BIMAS the farmer may join the INMAS program which actually
means that Government guarantees the availability of the inputs same as for
BIMAS but credit has to be acquired for on a private basis. No living
allowance and no special extension services are given. The interest rate
is 2-1/2% per month.
11.       The use of higher inputs is only effective in areas with an
efficient irrigation system. In the project area about 77,000 ha (1969/70
season) or 34% were under the BIMAS program, as compared to approximately
5% of the irrigated area for the rest of Java, reflecting the better
condition of the irrigation systems as well as the more progressive nature
of the farmers. Since BIMAS is only temporary and many of the farmers in
the non-BIMAS area use fertilizers, pesticides and good seed, it is believed
that after the rehabilitation of the irrigation systems and re-establishment
of a good water management, there will be no clear difference between the
yields of BIMAS and non-BIMAS areas. The Government will start the first
BIMAS-maize program in East Java in the season 1971/72.
Agricultural Credit
12.       The Bank Rakjat Indonesia (BRI) is the official source of credit.
The only type of agricultural credit is seasonal credit or short-term credit.
The interest rate on agricultural loans is 1% per month, in the framework of
the BIMAS program. BRI has teams of two or three persons who go out to the



ANNEX 3
Page 4
v:Lllages to handle the applications for loans. Land, houses, animals, or
aniything else of value, is accepted as collateral. A recommendation of
the village head, or good previous experience with the applicant may
influence the ultimate decision favorably. Credit obtained through BIMAS
is repaid in cash or kind.
13.       In addition to the Bank Rakjat Indonesia, there are village banks
and village paddy banks, but their working capital is very small and hence
the amount of credit furnished is insignificant as compared to that of the
Bank Rakjat Indonesia. The paddy banks lend members paddy for consumption
and seed and are repaid in kind at harvest time plus a fee of 10 to 25%.
Another source of credit is the maoney lender, who is normally a paddy
collector; interest rates are very high, but loan procedures are short and
the only collateral needed is the coming rice crop. Despite constraints in
credit facilities, credit does not seem to be a major bottleneck in the
acloption of improved agricultural techniques.

FOURTH IRRIGATION REHABILITATION PROJECT
Part A - Pekalen-Sampean Irrigation Systems
Project Works
Location
1.        The project is located in East Java (Map 1).  It consists of
five non-contiguous areas totalling about 229,110 ha spread over 15,000
km2 (Map 2), known as Pekalen-Sampean Irrigation Project.
The Area
2.        The five areas have been designated by letters A to E for
convenience and are shown in detail on Maps 3-7. Table 1 shows the size of
each area together with the division between Irrigation Districts and Table 2
gives an inventory of the works to be rehabilitated.
3.        There are 139 separate irrigation systems with 170 headworks
and wiers. The largest single system is 17,770 ha, whilst many areas are
smaller than 500 ha.
4.        The oldest part of the project was constructed in 1883, but the
majority of the canals and structures were built between 1920 and 1930.
The Project Works
5.        The project works consist of the rehabilitation of headworks, weirs,
canals and their structures. They also include the repair of inspection
roads and bridges, the construction of a base camp and houses for irrigation
officials. Provision is made for upgrading of selected semi-technical
areas.
Headworks and Weirs
6.        Most structures are in fair condition, but almost in all cases
new steel gates, seals and new hoisting gear are needed. The downstream
aprons of many weirs need repair. At Pekalen weir steel armor is required
on the crest for protection against rolling rocks.
Canal Works
7.        Most primary and secondary canals require desilting and the banks
need shaping and sodding. To protect canal banks from erosion in village



ANNEX 4
Page 2
areas, step landings will be provided for domestic purposes. Similarly,
buffalo wallow ponds with pitched stone banks will be provided at
the edge of every village on primary canals. To prevent excessive seepage
from high level canals and to prevent erosion on bends some masonry protection
to canal banks will be provided.
8.        The project works also include the rehabilitation of tertiary
canals and construction of checks and turnouts in these canals. PROSIDA will
be responsible for the first 50 m of the tertiary canals and the farmers
the remainder. PROSIDA will also provide permanent structures in the
tertiaries and headgates of the quaternaries. The permanent controls in
thie tertiary canals will be vital for better water control and distribution,
especially for growing crops during the dry season.
9.        Inspection roads are also in need of repair and many bridges
require major repairs or replacement.
Equiipment and Communications
10.       Since the canals cannot be shut down for more than 15 days due to
crop requirements and domestic needs, most primary canals will be excavated
by machine. All secondary and tertiary canal work will be carried out by
hand labor. Equipment for construction and later operation and maintenance
is provided in the project (Annex 9). This list of equipment has been
prepared after careful review of experience in the first rehabilitation
project (Credit 127-IND).
11.       The various telephone warning systems for floods or volcanic
erlptions are in poor repair. The project, therefore, provides for
modernization of the present warning systems and for radio communications
beitween the main district offices, field office at Djember, Surabuja and
Djakarta.
Floods and Levees
12.       The project area does not suffer from prolonged flooding, but
some parts are subject to flash floods of from 2 to 8 hours duration. Levees
have been built to protect agricultural land and irrigation systems, and
they are in need of repair. Near Lumadjang levees have been constructed
to protect valuable agricultural land from lava flows from Mount Semeru, an
aclive volcano.  The project allows for strengthening of these levees.
Operation and Maintenance
13.       The East Java Irrigation Service reports directly to the Governor
of East Java and is separate from the Highways Department. Elsewhere in Java,
highway and irrigation are combined in one department and the head of PWD
down to section chiefs are responsible for both activities. Due to this
separation the staff appear more dedicated to their irrigation work and have



ANNEX 4
Page 3
kept the irrigation systems operating in spite of lack of funds. Maintenance
has suffered through almost total lack of funds to purchase materials.
Once funds are made available for operation and maintenance the East Java
Irrigation Service will be able to carry out the work. Additional funds
required for the satisfact31y n & M rf th.e systerm during rehabilitation are
provided in the project and on completion will be supplied by GOI.
Semi-Technical Areas
14.       A semi-technical area is generally in the foothills in fairly
steep terrain. It has no permanent structures either in the canals
or at the headworks. By selecting the best areas for upgrading (building
permanent control structures) considerable saving in water can be effected.
It is estimated that about 12,000 ha of semi-technical areas would be
upgraded to technical areas.
Consulting Services
15.       The design capability in East Java is very low and PROSIDA's
design staff still require training and guidance. The project, therefore,
provides consulting services for planning, design, supervision of
construction and a feasibility study of Sampean Baru irrigation system
para 16). It is expected that the consultants will actually carry out
design work, and at the same time train their Indonesian counterparts
(Annex 5).
Sampean Baru FeailitStud
16.       The Sampean Baru irrigation system of which the feasibility study
is to be undertaken, covers an area of about 15,000 ha presently
unirrigated. The weir, head regulator and 9 km of main canal were built
during the 1940's but the weir was outflanked by the river. The system was
then left uncompleted and not used. A full engineering and cost-benefit
study is included in the project works.
Expenditure to Date
17.       Some rehabilitation has been carried out in the project area by
the East Java Irrigation Service from funds supplied by GOI. The expenditures
are as follows:
(jps million)    (US$'000)
1969/70                  316.8             765'

Part B - Groundwater Investigation
Project Works
Background
13.       Indonesia is a net importer of rice and the principal aim of the
current First Five-Year Plan is to ensure self-sufficiency in rice by 1975.
Two methods of achieving this are possible. The first is to increase yields
through the adoption of high yielding varieties, greater use of inputs and
the rehabilitation of irrigation systems. The second method is an increase
in cropping intensity. As all the available land, at least in Java, is
aLready cropped in the wet season, this amounts to increased cropping in
the dry season. At present, with the existing "run of the river" irrigation
systems, dry season cropping intensity in Java is generally between 20 and
30%. However, even in the same irrigation district, dry season cropping
intensity may range between zero and 100% between localities.
19.       During the last few years, it has been realized that groundwater
development may be an effective way of increasing cropping intensity.
Since the supply of surface water has, until recently, been sufficient for
all irrigation needs, there has been little development of groundwater. most
villages obtain their domestic water from shallow wells (3-5m deep) while
there has been some development of deep, artesian water for public supply
(t:ypically for public bath houses). In only few areas, there has been some
use of shallow wells for irrigation.
20.       In 1969, the Bank engaged a consultant, Mr. Sayyid Hamid, to make
a brief survey 1/ of potential groundwater development in Java. At the
same time, consultants for Credit 127-IND (Harza, USA) studied groundwater
possibilities 2/ for the areas involved in rehabilitation.
21.       Harza was later engaged under the Technical Assistance Credit
135-IND to formulate a groundwater exploration program. Their work,
carried out in July and August, 1969, included agricultural and economic as
well as engineering studies. The earlier reconnaissance studies showed
potential for groundwater development in five areas (Madiun Valley, Upper
Solo Valley, Pemali-Tjomal, Tjisedane and Rentang Project areas). Harza
1 /    "Report on Exploration and Development of Groundwater in Indonesia,"
July, 1969.
2/   "Reconnaissance Survey of Groundwater Potential in Irrigation Rehabili-
tation Projects," October, 1969.



ANNEX 4
Page 5
concluded 1/ that the last two areas had little potential for economic
groundwater development but recommended that an exploration program be carried
out in the Madiun, Upper Solo and Pemali Valleys.
22.       Meanwhile, in 1969 the Government engaged P. N. Waskita Karya, a
government-owned contracting firm, to carry out geologic and geophysical
studies and test drilling in the Upper Solo and Madiun areas. A report 2/
is available in Indonesian on the first part of the contract (geology and
geophysics). After many delays, due to inadequate equipment and their lack
of experience with this kind of work, Waskita Karya has drilled six wells -
four in the Madiun Valley and two in the Sragen district of the Upper Solo
Valley. Their investigation, however, is considered insufficient to
determine the groundwater potential for development. In April 1971 the
Government awarded Waskita Karya another contract for similar studies in
the Pemali-Tjomal area.
23.       Three basin studies in Java should also be mentioned.  The
Brantas Basin in East Java has been studied by the Japanese firm of Nippon
Koei but their studies did not include groundwater. The Kali Progo Basin
in the vicinity of Jogjakarta has been studied by Sir M. MacDonald and
Partners (UK) and their recommendations include some for groundwater
development. A basin study of the Djatunseluna area, under bilateral
assistance from the Netherlands, east of Semarang will begin soon. The
Government has also embarked on some small-scale, shallow groundwater
wells in the Ngandjuk area of East Java.
The Study Areas
24.       The areas to be investigated by the consultant are shown on Map
8. They comprise about 900 km2 around Sragen, in the Upper Solo
Basin, and the2whole of the Madiun Valley floor upstream of Ngawi,
about 1,600 km . Both these areas experience severe water shortages
not only in the dry season but frequently during the wet season if the mon-
soon rains are late. In addition they also experience floods towards the
end of the monsoon season when intense rainfall occurs in the upper reaches
of the watershed. These floods destroy crops which are almost ready for
harvest.
25.       Much of the Sragen area has no irrigation and depends on monsoon
rains for the production of rice on the lowlands and cassava and maize on
the uplands. The only available dry season water supplies are obtained
by rope and bucket from shallow dug wells which are frequently destroyed

by floods. Melons, maize, onion and chillies are grown and irrigated in
such manner in small areas. Farmers are very poor as compared to other
arieas.
26.       The Madiun Valley is irrigated but also experiences severe dry
season water shortages. During the monsoon season, rains are frequently
late and planting of rice may be delayed for one or two montns which in
turn delay harvest and increases the risk of loss of almost ripened grain
to floods. Dry season crops, mostly soybeans and maize, are often not
harvested because yields are too low to compensate for the work required.
The Investigation
27.       The investigation which is to be carried out by an expatriate
consulting firm would consist of the following:
(i) A study of the deep groundwater potential by means of
geoelectric surveys, borehole logging (to determine the
occurence and extent of aquifers) test holes, test wells
and pumping tests. Successful test wells would be
finished to the same standards as production wells and
would be operated for data collection on yields and
costs of running the wells. This would involve the
drilling of about 21 deep test holes and 12 test wells.
The study should include also the capital and 0 & M costs
of deep groundwater development.
(ii)  An economic and engineering evaluation of shallow
aquifers by means of three different kinds of shallow
wells - 20 dug wells about 10 m deep, 20 dug and bored
wells and 4 well batteries. Such wells may have lower
costs per unit of yield than deep wells.
(iii)  A comparative study of technical and economic viability
of the various methods of developing additional water
supplies for the areas or any part thereof. These methods
are:
(a) Shallow groundwater (i) dug wells
(ii) dug and bored wells
(iii) well batteries
(b) Deep groundwater
(c) Surface water (i) storage reservoirs
(ii) pumping from streams and drains
(iv) Agricultural studies to obtain an estimate of the benefits
to be obtained from supplemental supply of water.



ANNEX 4
Page 7
(v) A completion report showing which alternatives appear to be
economically attractive, bearing in mind organization,
financial and social constraints. It one or more groundwater
alternatives are recommended, the report would include
recommendations whether additional field data and studies are
required for determining feasibility of possible large scale
projects and the costs and time requirements for such work.
If groundwater development does not appear feasible, the data
and analysis would be included in the report with appropriate
recommendations. If surface water development appears
attractive, consideration would be given to financing feasibi-
lity studies outside this investigation program.
28.       Details of the required equipment are covered in Annex 9 while
the role of the consultant is outlined in Annex 5, which also includes
draft Terms of Reference. In order to avoid delays in drilling test wells
after completion of test holes, the consultant will purchase well casings,
screen pumps, engines and accessory supplies on quotations from suppliers and
bill the Government at the invoice price. Annex 7 Part B shows the proposed
program schedule, which indicates that if consultants are engaged by
May 1, 1972, the investigation would be completed by April 1, 1975. A
detailed cost estimate is given in Annex 8, showing an estimated total cost
of US$ 2.2 million, of which US$1.5 million (68%) would be in foreign
exchange.
Organization
29.       In 1969, a groundwater group was set up within the Directorate of
Planning and Programming in the Directorate-General of Water Resources Develop-
ment (Figure III). This group has been supervising on-going groundwater
studies and planning for future development. The group is guided in its work
by a steering committee composed of high-level officials in the Directorate-
General of Water Resources Development and the Geological Survey, Department
of Mines. It is proposed that this group handle the present program, though
most of the investigation works would be supervised and/or carried out by
the consulting firm.
30.       Matters such as procurement would be handled by the groundwater
group at headquarters in Djakarta (Figure III) . There would be one sub-project
manager for both the Sragen and Madiun study areas. He would be responsible
both to the Project Manager in Djakarta and to the Provincial Public works
Department (or, in the case of Madiun, which is in the Province of East Java,
to the Irrigation Service). The Provincial Chief of Public Works (or
Irrigation Service) is responsible both to the Governor (and hence to the
Minister of Internal Affairs) and the Ministry of Public Works in Djakarta.
This system is quite usual in Indonesia and seems to work smoothly, without
conflicts of authority.



ANNEX 4
Page 8
31.       The sub-project manager would be counterpart or co-manager to the
team. This should ensure that administrative problems do not arise during
the investigation.
Legral Aspects
32.       Water rights are vested with the State and are governed by the
Alj,emene Water Reglement of 1936, translated into Indonesian in 1968. A study
group is presently revising this law but no action is expected in the near
fut:ure. Article 28 of the statue states:
It is prohibited, except by permission of the Provincial
Authority concerned:
(a) to explore for groundwater at a depth greater than
15 metres; or
(b) to improve or purify existing artesian wells having
depths greater than 15 metres.
Permission will not be issued by the Provincial Authority
without consultation with the Mining Directorate concerned.
33,       This procedure is not expected to cause any difficulty or delay as
the provincial authorities are anxious to facilitate groundwater development
in their areas.
Part C - Feasibility Studies
34.       In order to provide for further irrigation projects, feasibility
studies have been included. They are:
(a) for a new irrigation system (15,000 ha) at Sampean Baru in
East Java;
(b) for another irrigation rehabilitation project (85,000 ha)
at Tjirebon in West Java; and
(c) for a surface water storage project on the Tjimanak River
to provide dry season irrigation for both Rentang and Tjirebon
areas (175,000 ha). This study would include flood control
and hydro-power.
35.       The work would be carried out by consultants supervised by the
Director of Irrigation under DGWRD.

investigation including test 5rilling in the Madiun Valley (about 1,600 km
and Sragen area (about 900 km ) in the Upper Solo Basin in Java. This



ANNEX 5
Page 10
program will be carried out for the purposes of determining (a) potential
yield of aquifers and cost and yield of deep and shallow wells in the two
areas, (b) the design and cost of production wells in areas suitable for
large scale projects, if studies establish justification for such projects,
and. (c) the benefits from irrigation with groundwater. The investigation
is expected to identify and evaluate areas with significant groundwater
potential, determine the design criteria and costs of wells and evaluate
the economic aspects of the development.
Scope of Consulting Services
2.        The work of the consulting engineers during the approximate period
May 1, 1972, to March 30, 1975, will be as follows:
(a) Prepare detailed specifications and tender documents suitable
for use by the Government of Indonesia in international
competitive bidding for one combination rotary-percussion and
one rotary drilling rig capable of drilling to depths of 400
meters, together with complete set of tools, spare parts and
auxillary equipment for installing casings, screens, engines
and pumps. Tender documents would also be prepared for procure-
ment of vehicles, pumping and power equipment needed for running
pumping tests.
(b) Provide assistance to Directorate General of Water Resources
Development in the evaluation of tenders received after interna-
tional competitive bidding and make recommendations for award.
(c) Provide one or two experienced drilling supervisors as
required to direct the drilling operations.
(d) Select and stake on the ground the locations of test holes
test wells, collect geologic and hydrologic data as required
for identification and evaluation of possible large scale
groundwater projects, utilizing shallow and/or deep aquifers.
(e) Provide geophysical resistivity and borehole logging equipment
and make supplemental surveys as required in the Madiun and
Sragen areas to determine the applicability of test hole and
test well data throughout the areas shown on Map 8 for use in
evaluating the feasibility of groundwater development in those
areas.
(f) Responsible for the drilling of about 21 test holes and 12
test wells as well as the conversion of successful test
wells to production wells. In this connection the Consultant
may sub-contract this work to a qualified Indonesian drilling
contractor who will be working under the direction of the
Consultant and under the close supervision of the
Consultant's drilling supervisors.
(g) The Consultant would purchase casing, screens, pumps,
engines and accessories needed for test wells and for



ANNEX 5
Page 11
converting them to production wells on quotations from
suppliers after completion of test holes. The Government
would be billed for these at invoice prices. Table 1
shows the estimated list of equipment and supplies to be
purchased by the Consultant.
(h)  Design, construct and evaluate three different kinds of
shallow wells - a total of about 20 dug wells, 20 dug
and bored wells and 4 batteries of 6 wells each. The
evaluation of the shallow aquifers should consider such
factors as recharge, storage and transmissibility as well
as cost, yield, drawdown and economic and engineering
feasibility under conditions prevailing in Indonesia.
(i!  Make preliminary studies of surface water augmentation by
surface reservoirs and/or low lift pumping from streams
and drains. These studies should evaluate the feasibility
of such developments for comparison with groundwater
development (shallow and deepwells). Only those reservoir
sites which would potentially serve as irrigation supply
within the study areas will be considered.
(1) Collect the necessary agricultural and economic data to
evaluate and recommend a proper course of action with
regard to the feasibility of possible large scale projects.
(k)  Although other reviews have not indicated economic sources
of surface water - by pumping or storage - an investigation
of these resources should be made.
(1)  Prepare a completion report on the investigation by
March 30, 1975. This report should include all data
collected during the investigation and analyses pertinent
to the development of possible large scale projects
including all aspects such as suitability of soils and
crops, availability of surface and groundwater, projected
market conditions and socio-economic factors. The comple-
tion report will make recommendations as to the most
economical means of augmenting the dry season water
supply. If one or more groundwater alternatives are
recommended, the report will evaluate the need for any
additional studies required to determine the feasibility
of large scale groundwater development. If additional
studies are recommended, the report should include a
detailed plan for such studies together with cost estimates
and time required for execution. If surface water develop-
ment apnears to be the most attractive, the report should
include recommendations for the required feasibility
studies, including a detailed plan, cost estimates and the
time required for such work.



ANNEX 5

FOURTH IRRIGATION REHABILITATION PROJECT
Water Supply and Requirements
1.        Though Indonesia experiences annual rainfall varying from 500 mm
in the coastal plains to over 5,000 mm in the mountains, the rains are often
delayed and unevenly distributed. During the wet northwest monsoon, the
rainfall is characterised by high intensity showers and thunderstorms
with considerable variation in frequency of occurence. The intensity and
unfavorable distribution of rainfall adversely affects rice production.
Furthermore, delay in the onset of the wet monsoon frequently results in
delayed planting of crops and if the wet season is short, crop yields are
depressed by water shortages at the time the rice grain is forming and
maturing. During the dry southeast monsoon, rainfall is even more unreliable.
For optimum crop production, in both wet and dry seasons, supplemental
irrigation water is required.
2.        In the project area, the rainfall varies from a minimum mean of
475 mm on the coast of Area B to a maximum mean of 3,070 mm inland in area
1 (Annex 2). The pattern of rainfall records show increasing rainfall with
increasing elevation and slightly less rainfall in the north and east of
the area. This is due to the prevailing winds and the shadowing effect of
the mountain peaks which form a central ridge on the eastern end of Java.
3.        Streamflow records were available in only a few stations in the
area. Some stations were operated prior to 1940 and abandoned, whilst
others have been established in the last few years. Automatic recording
gauges have recently been installed in some stations and discharge measure-
ments made with propeller type current meters. A fair number of staff
gauges exist throughout the area with some flow measurements made with
surface floats.
5.        Records indicate that the dry season stream flows generally remains
quite high in spite of the low dry season rainfall. Although this varies
over the project area, depending on the degree of afforestation in the hills
and mountains, it is due to the volcanic nature of the rocks and soil.
Surface rains are largely stored underground and reach streams and rivers
after long delays. Numerous springs exist on the slopes of mountains and
augment basic flows.
6.        In arriving at the demand for irrigation water, the modified
Blaney-rriddle method was used. This method has proved to give good results
in countries of similar climatic conditions such as Burma, India (in deltas),

the Philippines and Thailand. The project areas are planted with about 92%
paddy and 8% sugar cane in the wet season (sugar cane crops extending over
14-1/2 months). During the dry season the amount of paddy planted varies
from area to area, but is generally less than half the area, the balance
is planted with polowidjo (secondary crops) such as soybeans and maize. Since
there is such variety in rainfall, river flows and crops, water requirement
computations were prepared for all five areas on a sample basis. In each
area a typical irrigation system was selected for study and results pro-rated
for the whole area. Water requirement computations for Areas A to E are
shown in detail in Table 1 to 5 of this Annex.
7.        The amount of water required for irrigating seed beds and preparing
land for paddy transplanting was estimated at 175 mm at the beginning of
the wet season for the first crop and 125 am at the beginning of the dry
season for the second paddy crop. As the demand for water is heavier during
tLtese periods, staggering of planting dates as in the old established
Indonesian "Golongan System" was assumed. The present practice of closing
off irrigation water 2 weeks before harvesting has also been assumed in
arriving at the water requirement.
8.        The rainfall used was the dependable rainfall in 8 out of 10 years
or a probability of 80%. The same percentage was applied to river flows.
9.        Since in general records of the flows at the barrages or weirs
were not available, the flows were derived from the rainfall-runoff correla-
tion at other known sites.
1f.       The field irrigation efficiency (after the project) was estimated
to be from 70% to 75%. A conveyance efficiency of 70% to 80% was adopted.
The overall system efficiency thus ranges from 50% to 60% with an average
o1f around 55%. To arrive at these efficiencies, management of water would
have to be at a reasonably good level. Indonesian farmers have known and
piracticed irrigation for centuries and they are adept in water management.
There is no doubt that such efficiencies could be reached.
11.       The following Table gives areas that can be fully irrigated after
rehabilitation, during wet and dry season with related crops:

The Golongan System
12.       The water demand of rice differs according to its stage of growth.
In pre-War Indonesia it was generally accepted that on heavy soils, irrigation
applications for growing paddy ranged from 0.7 1/sec/ha to 1.0 1/sec/ha,
whereas for very light soils an application of 6.0 l/sec/ha was no exception.
13.       However, for good land preparation rice needs considerably more
water than durlng its growing period. In order to avoid exorbitant
capacity in the irrigation system to cope with the huge water demand for
land preparation, the irrigated area was divided into smaller irrigation units
and a rotation sVstem was used for irrigation applications. Each irrigation
unit is called a "golongan".
14.       Each golongan received 0.4 1/sec/ha during 2 weeks for the area to
be occupied by the nurseries, which is about one-tenth of the plantfield.
After this period there was a period of 4-6 weeks for land preparation
during which 1.4 1/sec/ha was given, followed by 12 weeks with 1.0 1/sec/ha,
and 2 weeks before harvest Irrigation was stopped. This schedule applied to
rice varieties with a growing period of 150 to 200 days. The new high
vielding varieties however, need a golongan system based on a growing period
of 13n to 150 days.
15.       This golongan system is also of particular importance for crops
grown during dry season when irrigation water is limited. By irrigating each
year different golongans, leaving the remaining part of the area without



ANNEX 6
Page 4
irrigation, each farmer will have his turn (one out of two years or two years
out of three years, depending on water availability) in receiving full
irrigation for his crops during the dry season. In this way the yields
and production of crops are better than without the Golongan system and farmers
receive equitable share of water.

INDONESIA
FOURTH IRRIGATION REHABILITATION PROJECT
Staff TraininR
1.        There is a dearth of trained and experienced personnel in almost
all fields of activity in Indonesia. Those trained prior to World War II
are either retired or nearing retirement. There has not been a sufficient
number trained since the war to fulfill the needs. This situation applies
to irrigation and agricultural activities and for this reason staff training
is provided in this project.
Irrigation Training
2.        The Ministry of Public Works and Electric Power (MPWEP) operates
two institutes - the Bandung Technical Academy and the Surabaja Training
Institute. Formerly, the Academy gave only formal academic courses towards
degrees in civil, electrical, mechanical engineering and architecture but,
since 1969, at the request of the Director General of Water Resources
Development, it has provided three short refresher courses for irrigation
sectional and sub-sectional officers and one for irrigation construction
foremen. Each course which lasted for a period of about 3 months, gave
training to about 35 persons.
3.        The Surabaja Institute was established only in 1970, with the sole
purpose of training old and newly recruited irrigation sub-sectional officers
and gate supervisors. The course for new recruits comprises 3 months of
classroom study and 9 months of actual working time in the field in an
operating irrigation project. If the person passes an examination given at
the end of the course, he would be given employment by the MPWEP. The course
for officers who have already been in service a few years, consists of three
months classroom study only. Each of the two classes has about 40 men.
4.        Though the Bandung Technical Academy has the capability to
give training to about 150 men per year and the Surabaja Training Institute
about 250 to 300 men per year, the number of classes at and the trainees
admitted to both the institutions have been much below these levels, due to
lack of operating funds. The costs of training at the Bandung Academy
including instructors, overhead, board and loading of trainees are estimated
at Rp 1,000 per capita per day while the same costs at Surabaja Institute
are about Rp 800. These costs do not include round trip travel from the
trainees' home town to the institutes.
5.        Under the Rehab III project (Credit 220-IND), funds amounting to
Rp 46 million have been provided for training of irrigation personnel on the
operation and maintenance of irrigation systems. Also an expatriate



ANNEX 11
Page 2
adviser on 0 & M and staff training has been employed by PROSIDA to assist
them on these two important aspects of the works. In this project Rp 49
million has been provided for the training of about 350 irrigation personnel
and about 135 agricultural extension officers and workers (see paras 7 & 8).
This would be one of the means of ensuring that the project after rehabilita-
tion would be properly operated and maintained for achieving the target
benefits.
6.        In addition, funds have also been allotted in the project for
sending six selected senior officials for overseas training and study tours
of irrigation projects. The consultants shall make arrangements for the
training of these engineers.
7.        Under the terms of reference of the consultants to be employed
in the implementation of the Pekalen-Sampean project, they would be required
to give in-service training to the Indonesian counterparts in the planning,
design, construction and operation and maintenance as far as possible.
Indonesian engineers and technicians would undoubtedly receive much benefits
from this.
Agricultural Training
3.        In order to realize the full benefits of the rehabilitation program,
training in modern agricultural practices is needed for the 125 agricultural
officers working at the Ketjamatan (sub-district) level in the Pekalen-Sampean
project area. Subjects to be covered in the training would include, for
example: (i) characteristics of new rice varieties and some important upland
crops and modern agricultural practices for these crops, (ii) cropping
pattern and crop diversification, (iii) the use of fertilizers and pesticides,
and (iv) methods and techniques of approaching and reaching the farmers.
The training course would require about one month and would be conducted
by both governmental and nongovernmental specialists. The cost of this
training, estimated to be about Rp 7.5 million, has been provided in the
project.
9.        In addition, refresher courses would be given to 12 subject matter
specialists (rice, upland crops, fertilizers, pesticides, etc.), in order
:hat they would be able to give advice and assistance to the extension workers
Ln these specific problems. This training would require about 2-3 weeks and
would be conducted at the Central Research Institute at Bogor. The cost of
this aspect of training is estimated to be about Rp 0.4 million.
110.      Under the project an expatriate agriculture extension adviser
would be employed directly by the Government to advise and assist on all
matters pertaining to agricultural extension service in the project area.
Noreover, the consultants to the project would also be required to have
an agronomist on their team to work for the project. One of the main
functions of these two experts would be to give advice and training to
the Indonesian agriculturists and extension officers. Both the experts
urould be working for the project for at least two years.



ANNEX 11
Page 3
Groundwater Training
11.       Because of the lack of experience in Indonesia of groundwater
development, consultants would be appointed to conduct the investigation
program. One of the main duties of the consultants would be to give in-
service training to the Indonesian geologists and engineers during the course
of the program. The consultants would be required also to furnish one or
two drilling supervisors so that they would train Indonesian technicians and
skilled men in the art of well drilling and collection of data and samples
and their analyses and interpretation of these data and samples.
12.       Provision has been made in this part of the project also for overseas
training of six selected Indonesian geologists and engineers in the investiga-
tion, planning, design and operation of groundwater projects. The consultants
would be responsible for making arrangements for such training.

FOURTH IRRIGATION REHABILITATION PROJECT
Farm Budgets
1.        The attached Tables 1 to 3 give representative farm budgets for
the Pekalen-Sampean project area. Three basic farm models have been used,
representing the three most common cropping patterns followed at the present
time (farm models I, II and III). Each farm model has been applied to three
farm sizes (0.5, 1.0 and 2.0 ha), and has been calculated under three
different conditions -- at the present time, in the future (1980) without
the rehabilitation project, and in the future with the rehabilitation
project.
2.        Although farm size in the project area averages 1.4 ha per farm,
the three farm sizes used are representative of the project area. Three
stages of farm development have been used because of the dynamic nature of
the agriculture in the project area. With the introduction of improved
rice varieties, the increased availability of fertilizer, other inputs
and credit, and the incentive provided by the rice support program, farmers
in the project area are rapidly adopting improved production techniques and
yields are increasing. It is reasonable to expect, therefore, that average
rice yields will increase somewhat over the next ten years even without the
project. At the same time, however, the inadequacies of the irrigation
systems will provide a ceiling to yield increases unless the system is re-
habilitated.
3.        The attached tables represent the actual payments, in cash or kind,
that a farmer makes and the actual income he receives from his irrigated
lowland during one year. It does not include income from off-farm labor nor
income from crops grown on land other than irrigated lowland. While more
intensive land use as a result of the project or a shift in cropping patterns
would utilize more family labor, it is not expected that this would signifi-
cantly reduce off-farm income. The farm budgets do not represent composite
cropping patterns, but only the more common ones; the small area of high-value
crops (tobacco, chillies, onions) that is found in the project area is
excluded, and so too, because of its unique financial arrangements, is sugar.
Other assumptions and definitions used in the budgets are discussed below.
4.        Gross value of production.  This has been calculated for each farm
from total yield before deductions for losses, seed, payment in kind, and
the average farm-gate price. Although the government operates a support
price for paddy; all evidence suggests that the average price received by
the farmer during the main (wet) season harvest between April and June is
considerably lower than the official floor price of Rp 14.5 per kg for dry
stalk paddy at the farm gate. Because of relative scarcity in the dry
season, however, the price received during the off (dry) season paddy
harvest is somewhat higher than the floor. In calculating the gross value



ANNEX 13
Page 2
of production, an average price of Rp 10 per kg for dry stalk paddy has
been assumed for the wet season crop, and Rp 16 per kg for the dry season
crop. Prices of soybeans and maize have been taken at the present levels
of Rp 40 and Rp 20 per kg respectively for all three models. Average crop
yields have been estimated according to the assumptions presented in Annex 12.
5.        Hired labor.  With the large population, small farm size and
general scarcity of alternative employment opportunities in the project
area, there is widespread underemployment and the opportunity cost of labor
is very low. For the economic analysis, the incremental input of labor at
t;he farm level has been costed at zero, but for the farm budget calculations
account has been taken of actual payments by farmers which represent, in
part, traditional transfers of labor within the community. The principal
labor requirement is at harvest, when for social reasons it is customary
for even very small farmers to use additional labor and to pay one-fifth
oE the crop for this. In the calculations, however, it was assumed that a
farmer with 0.5 ha or less would compensate for this payment by performing
similar work on other farms. Therefore, harvest labor has been costed, at
one-fifth of production, only in excess of 0.5 ha. Weeding and cultivation
is generally performed by the same labor as harvest, and is included in the
harvest charge. Almost all land preparation for rice is done with bullocks,
even on the smallest farm, and this has been costed at the current rate.
The labor input for land preparation, transplanting and fertilizers is
charged in excess of 1.0 ha. Spraying has been charged at the current
market cost of hiring a back-pack sprayer.
6.        Materials.  All materials have been costed at the market rate.
Tthe cost of seed has been calculated on the basis of purchased seed for
improved varieties and farm seed for traditional varieties. Interest on
purchased inputs has been charged at the rate currently charged by the
Bank Rakjat Indonesia (1% per month).
7.        Family consumption.  For the purpose of the farm budget analysis,
family consumption has been costed at the quantity of rice consumed by a
family of 5.7 persons. This has been taken at 125 kg. per person, or 1550 kg.
of' dry stalk paddy per family. Half of this has been charged at the higher
dry season priue. Other food items, which may be produced on the farm or
purchased, have not been costed.
8.        Tths.  Farmers pay a land tax (IPEDA), a charge to the Ulu-Ulu or
local irrigation official, and other village and mosque taxes. These have
been charged at average current rates.
9.        Wucer charge.  At the present, farmers pay only land tax (IPEDA)
a portion of which, about ip 400 per ha per year, has been used mainly to
operate the irrigation systems during the recent years. It has been assumed
that the Government will impose an additional charge of Rp 800 per ha to
cover the maintenance cost (altogether 0 & M costs being Rp 1,200 per ha)
and Rp 1,000 per ha to recover the rehabilitation cost of the irrigation
systems, and this increased charge has been included only for the "future -
with rehabil4rtation" model.



ANNEX 13
Page 3
10.       Other charges.  These include depreciation on small hand tools
(bullocks and plough have been costed directly as a land preparation cost) at
Rp 500 per farm year; and waste and loss of production at 5% of total output.
11.       Off-farm income.  This item has not been included in the farm
budget because little information is available on this additional income and
because it will not be affected significantly by the project.

FOURTH IRRIGATION REHATILITATION PROJECT
Economic Analysis
1.        The internal rate of return has been calculated using shadow
costs and prices to reflect the real costs and benefits to the economy of
the proposed project. The analysis compares the net value of production
that would be achieved with the project to that likely without the project.
The following specific assumptions were made:
(a) that some yield increases would be achieved even
without the proj ect-,
(b) that the opportunity cost of both family and hired
labor is zero;
(c) that benefits would begin to accrue on each part of
the project area the year after completion of construction
in that area;
(d) that five years would be needed to reach full agricultural
development after the completion of construction;
(e) that increased dry season water available as a result of
project works would be used for cultivation of maize and
soyabeans;
(f) that the reintroduction of the Golongan system would allow
dry season water to be used more efficiently;
(g) that the future world prices of rice will decline to US$79
per ton FOB Rangoon in 1975 and US$62 in 198O, and that
world maize and soybean prices will remain constant at
TJS$55 and US$100 per ton FOB Surabaja respectively;
(h) that current fertilizer prices in Indonesia reflect a
35Z subsidy in the case of urea and a 50% subsidy in the
case of triple superphosphate;
(i) that all taxes are financial transfers and do not represent
a true economic cost;
(1) that with the project annual 0 & M costs would increase by
approximately Rp 800 per ha (Rp 183 million for the project
area),



ANNE( 14

(k) that no increase in sugar yields would result from the
project; and
(1) that the project life would be 30 years.
2.        Under the above assumptions, the project would have an internal
rate of return of approximately 39%. The sensitivity of the project to
variations in the above assumptions was tested and found to be relatively
Insensitive to changes in timing or cost assumptions. The results of the
sensitivity analysis are as follows:
Rate of Return
A:   Construction cost over-run of IO%:             36%
B:   Construction cost over-run of 20%:             33%
C:   Period of construction extended by
2 years and benefits delayed by 2 years:   29%
D:   Benefits delayed by 2 years:                   26%
E:   Crop prices reduced by 10%:                    34%
P:   Incremental crop yields reduced by 10%:        35%
G:   All labor costed at market rates:              26%
H:   Cropping pattern based on use of increased
water for rice cultivation:                  36%
I.   Construction cost over-run of 102,
period of construction extended by 2 years,
benefits delayed by 2 years and incremental
crop yields reduced by 10%, or A+C+F           25Z
J.   I + all labor costed at market rates, or
I + G                                          17%
