REPORT AND RECOMIENATION OF THE PRIDEniT TO THE
EXUTIVE DIRECTORS ON A PROPOSED DEVLOPENT CREDIT
TO THE REUIC OF INDONESIA FOR A FOCURTH
IRRIOATION REABILITATION PROJECT
1.        I submit the following report and recommendation on a proposed
development credit to the Republic of Indonesia for the equivalGnt of
US$12.5 million on standard IDA terms to help finance a fourth irrigation
rehabilitation project.
PART I - INTRODUCTICK
2.        Indonesia has received seventeen IDA credits amounting to US$231.4
millon.    The composition of this lending reflects the priorities for
rehabilitation and development established by the Government.   Indonesia's
Pirst Five Year Plan (1969-1974) rightly gives highest priority to agriculture,
with particular emphasis on rice production as rice imports are a severe foreign
exdange drain.   Rice production has increased markedly over the last four
years and is expected to be auguented in the future by the works being carried
out under three previous IDA credits for rehabidlltation of irrigation systems
covering almost 700,000 ha, the first of which is now partly completed.    In
addition, IDA has made a credit to help increase rice yields throughout
Indonesia by establishing a seed multiplication program for high-yielding
rice varieties.       IDA also organized a consortium of lenders to finance a
major expansion of the PUSRI fertilizer plant.   Other credits in the agric-
cultural sector include three to assist rehabilitation of rubber, palm oil,
and tea estates and one for fisheries.   Theose nine credits account for well
over half of the Association's lending to ludonesia.
3.        To help bring about more syotematic planning and policy making in
the agricultural sector, we have financed a national fertilizer study and an
evaluation of rice production and intensifioation programs, as wvll as a study
of groundwater availability and potential uses*    An agriculture sector survey
mission to assesa further needs in this sector, in coordination with the
Resident Staff, is currently in the field.   Thue the Association is providing
substantial help to Indonesia in its drive to increase agricultural output.
4.        In order to accelerate rehabilitation in other sectors, oredits
for highways, power, telecoammmications and and education also have been made.
In recognition of the urgent need for institutional reforms, a iznber of IDA
projects have included major steps to reorganize existing institutions or
establish new ones.   At the eame time, to supplement the Government's efforts
in improving administration and menagemeznt, credits have included appropriate
provisions for consultant services and other technical asbistance.    In addition,



-2-
three technical assistance credits have been made to help finance pre-
investment studies undertaken by the Government, which have helped to
establish investment priorities over a wide range of activities.   A
summary statement of IDA credits and IFC investments is at Annex I.
5.         In addition to the present project, eight others are expected
to be ready in time for presentation to the Executive Directors within the
next few months.   These comprise TFurther projects in agricultural estates,
highways and power distribution and also projects in priority fields not
hitherto assisted: family planning, agricultural education, industrial
finance, smallholder rubber, and marine transport.
6.         The first IDAIjbredit to Indonesia was made in Sep't iber 1968.
Twelve of the seventeen credits were made since June 1, 1970. The program
is thus relatively new,.sand largely for this reason the undisbursed portion
of the credits is large* Another contributing factor is thit,virtually
every one of the credits has introduced extensive institutional reform, in-
volving creation of new project authorities, drafting of new charters, and
enactment of new legislation, all of which have taken much time. Several
credits have experienced pronounced delays in disbursement because of
management problems'.  These include the first and second agricultural
estates projects (Cre. 155 and 194-IND), the management of which continues
to cause some concern. We have informed the Government of steps which need
to be taken to remedy the situation, and it has undertaken to do so.
Similarly, delays have been encountered on the telecommunications project
(Cr. 210-IND), but the contract for the main item - the trans-Sumatra
micro-wave'network - has recently been awarded and an early ri'se in dis-
bursements is expected under that credit.  Disbursements on two projects,
electricity distribution (Cr. 165-IND) and education (Cr. 2J9..END), have
been substantially delayed because of problems in selection "ahiad ppointment
of consultants by the Government; for the electricity project, however,
orders are now being placed for equipment and disbursements are rising
satisfactorily. As to the education project, negotiations with consultants
have not yet been concluded, partly because of uncertainties resulting
from the Government's recent imposition of Indonesian income taxes upon
foreign consultants and contractors, but the contract is expected to be
signed shortly.  In the casv of the PUBRI fertilizer expansion project
(Cr, 193-IND), though disbursements will not rise appreciably until the
second half of 1972 when financing of equipment contracts will commence,
the project is on schedule and the Borrower's performance on ithis complex
project can be considered quite satisfactory.
7.         As to the previous irrigation credits, works on the first irriga-
tion rehabilitation project are proceeding well, and disbursements are on
schedule. The second such project was delayed by three months due to difficul-
ties in establishing the new project authority, but all construction contractshave
now been awarded and disbursements are expected soon to rise sharply. On the
third project, planning and design are progressing satisfactorily and con-
struction is underwayo



-3-
8.        The overall disbursement rate of the Indonesian lending program
has risen appreciably in recent months.   Total disbursements as of January 31,
1972, were US$33.9 million; of this amount US$25.2 million have been disbursed
since April 1, 1971.   The pace of disbursements is expected to accelerate
further, since orders had been placed or contracts awarded amounting to a total.,f
US$70.3 million as of December 31, 1971.
PART II - THE ECONCIY
9.        The latest Bank economic report an Indonesia (EAP-27a) dated
November 30, 1971, finds that Indonesia's economic progress continues to be
satisfactory.   The economy appears to be growing at present at around 6-7
percent in terms of GDP, while price stability is being maintained and exports
are increasing.   Production of rice, the basic commodity, has increased sub-
stantially for the fourth successive year.   In the industrial sector, especially
in textiles, there is further substantial growth.   With private foreiga invest-
ment accelerating and the rehabilitation and expansion of dowastic enterprises
being fostered under official programs, the prospects of industrial growth from
the present small base are good.    (Country Data are presented in Annex II.)
10.       While economic progress is at an early stage, the problems Which
remain to be tackled are large.   Advances are being made in forAmulating plans
programs and projects ind in starting to implement them, but the limited
managerial and financial resources available still present a serious obstacle*
The pressure on financial resources is evidenced by the continuing high rates
of interest which prevail in the economy and by the necessity for a devaluation
A l        0-- - -  'Iared in p'vrt as a precaution in the face of internationial
uncertainties and in part to restrain. import demand following a loss in foreign
exchange reserves.   In 1972 there is prospect of a significant increment in
both foreign exchange earnings and Government revenues, as a result orincipally
of sharp increases in oil production and the volume and value of oil axports.
The demand for resources is so great, however, that this increment will moderate
but not reduce the need for aid to supplement the domestic resources available
for public and private investment and the improvemont of essenttal Gov4,rnment
services.
11.       Government revenues in 1971/72 (April-March) are now astimateci to be
20 percent higher than last year.   A much larger increase, 36 percent, is
projected for 1972/73.   The largest item in this increase would be taxes
on expected higher earnings of foreign oil companies, but other revenues would
increase by 18 percent.   The increment of Rp. 150 billion ($360 million) will
finance increases in salaries and material expenditures en the ordinary budget,
while still allowing for a doubling (to Rp. 136 billion) in the sizH of the
surplus available for the development budget.    Together with the counterpart
funds generated by program aid (estimated at.Rp. 95 billion) this will provide
for a development budget in 1972/73 of Pp 231 billion, which is 40 percent
larger than that for 1971/72.



- 4 -
12.       Exportszare expected to rise by 10 percent in 1971/72 with the
prospect of a 29 percent increase to $1,270 million in 1972/73. Most of
this is accounted for by oil exports, which will increase by 40 percent in
1971/72 because of price increases during the year and by almost 100 percent
in 1972/73 because of increased production at the higher price now established;
and by timber exports, up 44&percent in 1971/72 and projected to increase by
27 percent to $220 million ,in 1972/73.  For all other exports, aggregate
value may be down somewhat in 1971/72, due primarily to lower prices for
rubber, with a modest recovery in the following''year.
13.       Imports of goods and services of3$1,778 million are projected for
1972/73, which may mean a current account deficit of just ovd'er *6O million,
)slightly larger than that eOected this year.   Debt payments 'i   be slightly
lower; the increase in private capital inflows is expected to e somewhat
'higher; and public capital inflow, at $520 million, is expectid- to be higher
,by $75 million, because ot increas'ed project aid utilization, 1ifi that fore-
icast for 1971/72.
j40.      Bank Group assistance to Indonesia is part of the international
,support being given in increasing amount through the Inter-Governmental Group
for Indonesia (IG&).    Commitments of aid have risen from $200 million in
.1967 to well over $600 million for 1971/72.  The proportion of project aid
'has steadily increased over this period, but substantial program aid remains
essential as support for the balance of payments and - in spite of strong
'domestic revenue efforts - as a supplement to rupiah resources for the
development budget.   For 1972/73 the Governmen't has requested 10IG aid
conmitments of $670 million, of which $350 million is forprojedt aid and
$320 million for program aid.  At its meeting at Amsterdam in De4ember 1971,
-the IGGI accepted this request, endorsed by the Bank and Fund, 'U  realistic
.in relation to Indonesia's requirements.  Preliminary indicat±igi of support
by a number of member countries suggest that the request will afgin be met.
15.       Following the rescheduling arrangements for pre-1966 external debt
which culminated in April 1970 in agreement on a long-term settlement of the
debts held by Western creditors and Japan, and subsequent agreements on similar
lines with several Eastern European countries, the ratio of external debt service
to exports is currently low, about 11 percent of exports.  It will rise
appreciably throughout the 1970's as grace periods expire on aid received after
1966, but should remain manageable during the decade if good export performance
continues and if new aid remains available on concessional terms similar to
those at present obtained from the IGGI.  All aid from the IG01 donors has
been given on concessional terms approximating the standards set by the DAC.
Consistent with this pattern, the Bank Group's assistance to Indonesia (aside
from IFC investments) has so far been provided exclusively in the form of IDA
credits.



PART III - THE PROJECT
16.       The project is composed of three parts (see Annex III).    Part A
would rehabilitate and improve the Pekalen-Sampean irrigation systems which
service 229,000 ha. of important rice producing land in East Java (see map
attached).   PROSIDA, an executive body in the Directorate General of Water
Resources Development, would administer the rehabilitation work in this part
of the project. PRCSIDA has been doing well in implementing the firat and
third irrigation rehabilitation projects (the Djatiluhur Authority is res-
ponsible for the second). It is capable of executing the rehabilitation part
of this fourth project, and the increased responsibility would not adversely
affect the implementation of the first and third projects.    However, to ensure
that PROSIDA maintains its strength and capability, an assurance has been
obtained that the Government will have PROSIDA at all times staffed with
qualified personnel under the supervision of a competent and experienced General
Manager; prior to the appointment of any new General Manager, the Government
would consult with the Association on the qualifications and experience of
candidates.   Fhrthermore, because of the serious shortage of planning and
design capability in Indonesia, consultants would be engaged to provide
engineering services, which would in part be financed by the proposed credit0
17.       1brks in Part A include desilting of canals, repairing of canal
banks and structures, and replacing of brushwood checks and drops in tertiaries
with permanent structures.    Most of the work would be implemented by labor
intensive methods, but machinery would be eployed for desilting large canals
which cannot be shut down without severe interference with crop production.
PROSIDA would rehabilitate the primary, secondary and the first 50 meters of
tertiary canals and would construct permanent structures on tertiaries and
head rates for quaternaries.   The remaining length of tertiary canals and
of quaternaries would normally be rehabilitated by farmers with guidance and
direction from PROSIDA and the appropriate local authorities.    If farmers
fail to carry out this work, the Government would complete the rehabilitation
or cause it to be completed.   Also included in Part A are assistance in
strengthening agricultural extension programs in the project area, and a
program of local and overseas training in the planning, design, operation and
maintenance of irrigation systems.
18.       There has been no systematic investigation of the groundwater
potential in Indonesia, and groundwater resources have not yet been widely
exploited for irrigation.   Part B of the Project would comprise an investiga-
tion of groundwater resources and alternative sources of supplementary water
in the Upper Solo and Madiun Valleys (2,500 Km2) in Central Java. The investi-
gation would attempt to determine the most economical way of increasing water
supplies for agricultural production in these water-scarce areas.    It would be
executed by the Groundwater Group in the Directorate General of Water Resources
Development.   Because of lack of experience in Indonesia of groundwater



* 6 -
development, consultants would be engaged to help the Groundwater Group
in the investigation; their services would be financed out of the proposed
credit.   If results of the groundwater study are favorable, they could lead
to a future irrigation project.   Local and overseas trainLng would be
provided for about six engineers or geologists in the planning, design,
construction and operation of groundwater projects..
19.       Part C comprises feasibility studies for future irrigation projects.
These are a new irrigation system at Sampean Baru_in East Java; an irrigation
rehabilitation project at Tjirebon in West Java; and a surface ware,z storage
project on the adjacent Tjimanuk river to provide dry season water for the
Rentang irrigation system - which is being rehabilitated under Credit 127-IND -
and the Tjirebon irrigation ,system.  The studies would be administered by the
Directorate Generalof Water Resources Development and would be carried out by
consultants acceptable to the Association.
20.       The estimated cost of Part A is equivalent to US$20.2 million (not
counting farmers' contributions in completing tertiary and quarternary irrigation
canals and structures on their own land), of which the foreign exchange component
would be $6.5 million, or 32 percent.    As in earlier irrigation rehabilitation
credits to Indonesia, the Association would contribute 50 percent of the cost
of Part A of the project, including about $3.6 million of local costs.    As I
noted in my Reports (P-830 and P-689) for the second and third irrigation
rehabilitation projects respectively, it is not feasible at this stage of
Indonesia's economic recovery for external lenders to cover Indonesia's large
resource gap by financing only the import component of projects.    The prcposed
project has a relatively low foreign exchange component and yet promises to
yield a high economic rate of return and to make an important contribution
towards the Gbvernment's drive to achieve self-sufficiency in fooqd.   In these
special circumstances I consider some financing of local currengy expenditures
on this part of the project to be appropriate and justified.
21.       The estimated cost of Part B is US$2.2 million and of Part C is
US$1.0 million, with foreign exchange components of US$1.5 million (68 percent)
and US$0.9 million (87 percent) respectively.   The proposed credit would finance
the foreign exchange costs of Parts B and C of the project, with local currency
costs met by the Government.   The total project cost is thus equivalent to
US$23.4 million of Which the Association would finance US$12.5 million, i.e.
53 percent (including US$3.6 million of local cost), and the Government would
finance the remaining US$10.7 million.
22.       The civ.l works under Part A, estimated to cost US$8.6 million, consist
of a large number of small individual works scattered over the 139 systems which
constitute the Pekalen-Sampean complex. In many instances the exact scope of re-
habilitation works cannot be specified in advance. Some of the works are seasonal,
and each job must be s^cheduled to minimize interference with farming and to suit
irrigation schedules. As in the third irrigation rehabilitation project (Cr.220-IND),
the civil works would be grouped into contracts of at least US$15,000 equivalent.
These would be opened to international competitive bidding, prequalification being
required for contracts exceeding $75,000.  Since the size of individual contracts is
not likely to be attractive to foreign bidders, advertisements would be limited to
local newspapers.



-7-
23.        Drilling under Part B would be for a small number of test-holes
and wells at widely scattered sites and at a rate of work dictated by the
investigation program;  hence international bidding would not be appropriate
for well drilling., and the consultants would sub-contract drilling to competent
local firms. Casings, pumps and other materials needed to bring successful
test vells into production vill have to be imported, but the types and quantities
required will only be known when tests are completed and thus cannot be determined
in time to allow international competitive bidding. As and when needed,. these
items would accordingly be purchased through local suppliers by the consultants,
acting as agents for the Government. The ahiount of the credit involved is not
likely to exceed $230,000.
24.        Local bidders would be allowed a margin of preference of 15 percent
or the actual customs duties payable by non-exempt importers, whichever is lower.
Local manufacturers and assemblers are expected to be 8uccessful bidders for only
a small portion of the equipment procured under the project, thov.gh at present it
is not possible to make a firm estimate of this portion.
25.        As was done in the first, second and third irrigation rehabilitation
projects, the Government would undertake to adopt and enforce legislation authori-
zing collection of taxes on irrigated land or on its users in the project E.rea,
to collect such taxes within one year after each system is rehabilitated, and to
set the taxes at levels adequate to provide enough revenue to cover full operating
and maintenance costs within two years of rehabilitation of each system (Section
4.O5 of the draft Davelopment Credit Agreement), As in the first and third irri-
gation rehabilitation projects, no provision is made for the recovery of investment
costs, on the grounds that over the past decades farmers have paid for maintenance
through the land taxes and rehabilitation is now needed only because maintenance
has not in fact been carried out. However, the Goverrmnt has agreed to complete
by t4arrzh 3s 1Q7r (hy whlh  ate the project's benefits are expected to start
accruing to the farmers), a study of the estimated economic benefits of Part A
of the project, including the increase in income of farmers and the possibilities
for mobilization of part of such increased income for further developmentO  The
Government will consult with the Association on the conclusions of the study,
which are expected to be of assistance to the Government in determining appropriate
fiscal and economic policies for the agriculture sector.
26.        Rice production in 1970 was estimated at 116 million tons, and about
500,000 tons was imported. rehabilitation of irrigation saystms, combined with
price supports for rice and increased use of improved seeds and fertilizera, has
led to a significant increase in rice production, and rice imports seem likely to
be greatly reduced over the next few years. However, the relatively high income
elasticity of demand for rice in Indonesia coupled with the growth of population
suggests that there should be no difficulty in absorbing the additional rice that
would be produced by the project at full development. Soybeans and maize are
exported to the rapidly growing Japanese market and other East Asian countries.
Market prospects for these two cDmmodities are good.
27.        The Government currently supports the price for milled rice at 1p 36
per kg ex-mill (ranging to Rp 36 per kg for better quality grain), equivalent to
Rp 14.5 per kg for dry stalk paddy at the farm-gate. This price is supported only



- 8 -
by BULOG (the central rice purchasing agency) purchases at the mill, however,
and the price received by the farmer is frequently below the official minimum.
RLce purchased by BULOG is used to provide rations for Government services and
the armed forces, and is released into the market only when necessary to keep
the retail price below Rp 50 per kg.  The present retail price of rice, Rp 45
per kg, is equivalent to about US$108 per ton. This compares with a current
world price of about US$85 per ton f.o.bo Fangoon for 42 percent broken rice,
or about US$100 landed in Djakarta.  The recent devaluation of the rupiah,
therefore, has brought domestic rice prices into line with world levels, These
levels are at their lowest for the past thirty years, and it is unlikely that
there will be any significant further decline in rice prices in the future.
28.        Part A of the project would increase Indonesia's annual output of
rice by about 150,000 tons, of soybeans by about 40,000 tons, -and of maize by
about 30,000 tons, This is equivalent to a gross foreign exchinge savings of
about US$11 million yearly on rice imports, and to increased gross export
earnings of about US$6 mllUion yearly from soybeans and maize. The rate of
return on this part of the project is estimated to be about 26 percent at going
wage rates, but would be about 39 percent, assuming that the opportunity cost
of both family and hired labor is zero. The Government will. establish a system
to monitor the economic benefits of the project. The groundwater investigation
in Part B, if successful, could lead to large scale development projects;  and
the benefits of an assured water supply would greatly increase crop production
and thereby raise farmers' living standards. The feasibility studies under
Part C are for a new irrigation system and for rehabilitation elsewhere with
surface water storage, providing dry season irrigation as well as flood control.
29.        After the re-introduction of adequate operation and maintenance, it
-would be necessary to improve water management at the farm level to obtain full
benefits from the project. The response of project area farmers to new inputs
leaves little doubt that they will learn the techniques rapidly and apply them
enthusiastically. In order to bring all the people essential to the running of
the irrigation systems together, the Government proposes to re-establish irriga-
tion advisory committees at the sub-district level with officials from irrigation,
agriculture, local government and farmerst representatives as members.  As in the
case of Credit 220-IND, assurances were obtained during negotiations that such
committees, with satisfactory terms of reference, would be established within
12 months, Further assurances were obtained that the rationing of dry season
water supply by a system of rotation would be reinstated as soon as each irri-
gation system is rehabilitated.
PART V - LEGAL INSTRTME&TS AND AUTHORTY
30.        The draft Bavelepsmat Credit Agreement between the Republic of
Indonesia and the Association, the recommendation of the Committee referred
to in Article V Section 1 (d) of the Articles of Agreement of the Association,
and the text of a draft resolution approving the proposed credit are being dis-
tributed to the Ececutive Diftectors separately. The draft Development Credit
Agreement is in the usual form for this type of project and follows closely
the text of the Development Credit Agreement for the third irrigation rehabili-
tation project.



31.        1 am satisfied that the proposed Development Crdit would comply
with the Articles of Agreemnat of the Assdciation.
PART VI - REOX?9ENTION
32.        I recomend that the Bcecutive lrectors approve the proposed
Devlopment Credit.

INFlONSIA - CREDIT AND PROJECT SUMARIY
Borrower:   Republic of Indonesia.
Amount:     US$12.5 million equivalent.   The proposed credit would cover half the
cost of irrigation rehabilitation and the foreign exchange cost of
groundwater investigation and of preparation of possible future irriga-
tion projects.   The credit would thus cover about 53% of the project
costs - including $3.6 million of local currency costs - and the
Government would finance the remaining $10.7 million.
Terms:      Amortization in 50 years including a 10 year period of grace through
semi-annual installments of i of 1 percent from March 1, 1982 through
September 1, 1991 and of 13 percent from March 1, 1992 through
September 1, 2021.   Service charge would be 3/4 of 1 percent.
Project:    The project comprises three partst
A. Rehabilitation and improvement of the Pekalen-Sampean irrigation
systems which serve 229,000 ha. of important rice producing areas in
East Java, training of irrigation and agricultural staff, and
strengthening of agricultural extension programs,
B. investigation of groundwater resources in the Upper Solo and Madiun
Valleys (2,500 kimi) in Central Java for use in agriculture, and
C. feasibility studies for future irrigation projects, comprising a
new irrigation system at Sampean Bami in East Java, rehabilitation
of the Tjirebon irrigation system in West Java, and surface water
storage on the Tjimanuk river to provide dry season water to
irrigation systems in West Java.

Procurement    All goods, except oonstruction materials other than steel, would
Arrangements: be procured after international coapetitive bidding in accordance
with-the Association's guidelines.   Local bids would be allowed
a margin of preference of 15% or the actual customs duties payable
by non-exempt importers, whichever is lower, for goods manufactured
or processed locally.   Civil works will be grouped into contracts
of at least $15,000 equivalent. These would be open to international
competitive biddiAg, pre-qualification being required for contracts
exceeding $75,000.   Since the size of individual contracts is
unlikely to be attractive to foreign bidders, advertisemnents would
be limited to local newspapers.   For the groundwater investigation
the consultants will act as agents for the Government, sub-
contracting drilling to local.competent firms and purchasing items
through local suppliers.
Disbursement   The Association would disburse against the c.i.f. price of imported
Arrangements:  goods and the foreign exchange cost of consultants.', services and
training.   Where an award is made to a local manufacturer or
assembler, disbursement would be made for the ex-factory price
net of taxep on the sale of the goods involved. 'In order to
finance 50 percent of the cost of Part A of the project, IDA would
finance 44 percent of the estimated cost of civil works.
