REPORT AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE
PRESIDENT TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS
PROPOSING AN INCREASE IN THE AMOUNT OF THE LOAN
TO THE KARIBA NORTH BANK COMPANY LIMITED WITH THE
GUARAUNTEE OF THE REPUBLIC OF ZAMBIA FOR THE KARIBA NORTH PROJECT
(Loan 701-ZA of July 7, 1970)
1.        I submit the following report and recommendation for a supplemental
loan to the Kariba North Bank Company Limited for the Kariba North Project,
in an amount of $42.1 million equivalent, to finance cost increases. The
proposed supplemental loan would be in the form of a second7trEache of Loan
No. 701 ZA (Kariba North Project), increasing the original amount of Loan No.
701 ZA from $40 million equivalent to $82.1 million equivalent. The grace
period under the original loan (the first tranche) would be extended by
eighteen months (from July 31, 1975 to January 31, 1977); the rate of interest
on the second tranche would be 7-1/4 percent per annum; and amortization of
both tranches would be over a peri,)d of twenty years, commencing February 1,
1977.
PART I: THE ECONOMY
2.        The last Economic Report on Zambia (Report No. 4-ZA) was issued on
December 26, 1972. An updating mission visited Zambia in October-November
1973. The most recent economic data are summarized in Annex I.
3.        The economy is characterized by a distinct dualism between the
large modern sector and the rural subsistence erconomy. Almost half the
population of 4.5 million is involved in the modern sector; the remainder
depend for their livelihood on small-scale traditional agriculture. The
average per capita national income in 1971 was estimated at $100 in the
traditional sector while the figure for the modern sector is over $650.
There are approximately 400,000 in wage employment, which has been growing
at about 3 percent per annum in recent years. Population growth is estimated
at 2.5 percent per annum.
4.        The shortage of trained citizens to man the economy has been a
critical constraint to development. At Independence (1964) there were only
about 100 citizens who were university graduates and 1,000 possessing
secondary school level certificates. Since then remarkable progress has
been made in expanding education at all levels. At present there are over
800 Zambian university graduates and the annual output from the secondary
schools has risen to over 6,000. In recent years the Government has placed
special emphasis on expanding vocational and technical training.
5.        The modern sector is dominated by the copper industry, which con-
tributes nearly 40 percent of GDP and 95 percent of exports. Thus the world
copper price has a large and pervasive effect on the economy. Unfortunately,



the copper price is notoriously unstable and the Government has inadequate
means of insulating the economy from the fluctuations of the copper market.
In recent months, Zambia has benefitted from the record copper prices result-
ing in a dramatic improvement in the country's financial and foreign exchange
position. However, it is essential to view the present exceptional situation
in a longer term perspective. Economic trends between 1970-73 were in sharp
contrast with those in the preceeding years, as well as current trends.
6.        Between 1964 and 1969, gross national income at constant prices
grew on the average by almost 17 percent a year.   More than half of this
increase, however, resulted from the improvement in terms of trade. Then,
as now, the sharp increase in the world copper price had placed Zambia in
a strong financial position. The Government's budget and the balance of
payments produced growing surpluses. In the course of 1970, however, the
period of rapidly rising incomes ended owing to a combination of unfavorable
factors. The two most important factors were the sharp deciine in the copper
price in the second half of 1970 from US$1680 to US$1090 a toA and the flood-
ing of the Mufulira mine in September 1970 which accounted for 25 percent
of Zambia's copper output. The combined result of lower copper prices and
production losses was a fall in the value of copper output of 40 percent
between 1969 and 1971 and a fall in gross national income per capita from
US$425 to about US$355 over the same period, with little recovery in 1972
and 1973. Although the price of copper improved markedly in the second half
of 1973, sales fell below the projected level due to a combination of produc-
tion problems and transport bottlenecks.
7.        The decline in the value of copper sales between 1970 and 1972
had a strong adverse affect on the budgetary situation, national savings and
the balance of payments. The deterioration in the budgetary situation was
compounded by two additional factors: first, recurrent expenditures had
been allowed to increase sharply aid second, government revenue from the
mining sector declined because of new capital depreciation allowances granted
as an incentive to boost further investment. Consequently, the Government's
recurrent budget which in 1970 still had a surplus of US$246 million - more
than enough to finance all development expenditure -- showed deficits of
US$25 million in 1971 and US$76 million in 1972. At the same time private
savings were also adversely affected and their domestic availability further
reduced by the mounting problem of capital flight since 1969. In 1973,
partly as a result of improved copper prices and partly owing to severe aus-
terity measures, the recurrent budget showed a small surplus of approximately
US$37 million.
8.        Net foreign reserves declined from a peak of US$605 million in
August 1970, to US$131 million by December 1973 (equal to two months imports).
This sharp decline cannot entirely be explained by the unfavorable develop-
ment in the prices and output of copper and by government's deficit financing
alone. Part of the decline was due to legal and illegal capital exports.
9.        The Government has over the past two years taken steps to restore the
financial balance. To improve the balance of payments, imports of certain



luxury goods and consumer goods that are also produced locally were prohibited,
and a surtax on dutiable imports was introduced. Exchange control regulations
were tightened, including measures to curb capital flight. To improve the
budgetary situation, new tax measures were introduced in the 1972 and 1973
budgets. Austere spending policies kept the increase in recurrent expenditure
down to 4 percent in 1972 and 6 pe:-cent in 1973. The underlying positive
trend in the balance of payments o;curing over the past twelve months has
been obscured by the Government's cecision to repay bonds that had been con-
tracted in 1969 in payment for the acquisition of a majority shareholding in
the two major mining groups. The repayment (US$239 million) was financed,
in part, from two Eurodollar loans totaling US$150 million.
10.       The closure of the Rhodesian border created a serious crisis, caus-
ing severe restrictions on imports and necessitating major expenditures on
expanding the capacity of alternative routes. Shortage of imports held back
investment and interfered with copper production. The value of total imports
fell slightly in 1973, and gross fixed capital formation is estimated to have
declined from US$525 million in 1972 to US$367 million in 1973. It is expected
that, as a result of the emergency measures taken over the past twelve months,
imports will rise substantially in 1974-75. The Tanzania-Zambia Railway
which is now being used to transport goods to the Zambian border should be-
come fully operational in 1975 and, provided the Lobito and Malawi routes
remain open, Zambia should have no problem obtaining all her essential im-
port requirements.
11.       Zambia's Second National Development Plan, 1972-76 (SNDP) envisaged
a total investment of US$3,000 million, of wh:Lch approximately one-half was
to be undertaken by Central Government, one-eighth by public sector enter-
prises and the remainder by the private sector. The core of the SNDP was the
proposed investment of US$560 million in the expansion of copper production.
The targets set in the SNDP are now largely of historical interest. The
unanticipated fall in the price of copper and the emergency situation arising
from the closure of th'! Rhodesian border led to a reduction and distortion
in planned capital expenditure.  The Government has commenced the preparation
of the Third National Development Plan (1977-81) which is scheduled for pub-
lication in 1976.
12.       In brief, Zambia's primary objective is to sustain growth
while: (i) correcting the rural-urban imbalance; (ii) redistributing
income; and (iii) providing new employment opportunities. Zambia hopes
to achieve this objective by investments in (a) mining and the related
power sector to yield income for strengthening other sectors, (b) manu-
facturing industries to become less dependent on imports and to expand
employment opportunities, (c) agricultural production and processing
industries to make Zambia self-sufficient in most foodstuffs, and
(d) rural development projects to benefit large nurbers of rural poor.
The most difficult challenge is to raise the productivity of the large tradi-
tional agriculture sector. Recognizing the need for a concentrated effort
to improve traditional agriculture, the Government has decided on a strategy
of integrated rural development, which has been successfully introduced in
some other African countries. The Government plans to start "Intensive



- 4 -
Development Zones" (IDZs) in two or three areas with suf'icient potential,
and, if successful, subsequently increase their number. Attempts to increase
agricultural productivity will be accompanied by investments to improve the
quality of life in rural areas by providing, for example, community centers,
rural electrification, improved roads and water supplies, health facilities
and village industries.
13.       Although copper will remain for many years Zambia's most important
economic asset, sustained long-term economic development depends on the
creation of a more diversified econorm4C structure.  To encourage d-1ve siF-ca-
tion, a number of important policy changes, particularly relating to pzices
and incomes are required.
14.       The Government has recently boosted agricultural producer prlces
but has yet to raise consumer prices so as to reduce the large subsidies
enjoyed by residents in the urban areas. It has put into effect the first
elements of a new incomes policy, which is designed not only to reduce the
great disparity between urban and rural incomes but also to obtain a greater
share of incomes generated by the mining industry for the developmenit of
the rest of the economy. One of these elements is the measures, announced
in August 1973, designed to give the Government a firmer control of the
mining industry. As the new arrangements are still being negotiated, it is
too early to say to what extent they will enable the Government to increase
the contribution of mining to general economic development without affecting
detrimentally the production and efficiency of the mines. Another element
of the new incomes policy relates to wages and salaries paid to Zambfan
workers. The manifesto which was recently adopted by the Central Committee
of the ruling party announced the introduction of a "Zambian wage structure".
This would separate the wages paid to Zambians from those paid to expatriates
so that the wage basic levels in the economy could reflect more truly the
economic conditions in Zambia rather than the conditions on the international
labor market for the supply and demand of highly skilled expatriates.
15.       Zambia's financial position over the past year has improved sub-
stantially with the marked upswing in copper prices. Average copper prices
in 1973 were about 50 percent higher than in 1972, and prices in 1974 are
forecast to increase further. The high copper price has increased the
Government's scope for noninflationary domestic borrowing by tapping part
of the excess liquidity created by the external surplus.    For 1974, the
budgetary position should improve further and domestic revenues may once
again be used to finance a substantial part of government investment. In
view of this prospect, Bank lending would be mainly related to foreign costs
of projects but some local cost financing may be justified for projects in
the social and agriculture sectors where the foreign exchange component is
very small.  Budgetary savings, together with disbursements from foreign
loans, should cover the financial needs of the Government.and there would
be no need for deficit financing.
16.       Over the past year, the Government has actively sought foreign assist-
ance for the public sector investment program. At the same time, it stepped
up borrowing from commercial sources. Because of its limited borrowing in



- 5 -
the past, Zambia's debt service obligations are low. Thus, there is consider-
able scope for further borro7wing abroad on conven'tional terms. To achieve a
5% growth rate Zambia's foreign borrowing will have to increase gradually from
US$120 million in 1974 to US$250 million p.a. in 1980 and to US$300 million p.a.
in l985.  The debt service ratio would grow from 3.9% in 197L to .5% in 1985,
assuming that exports grow at 5% p.a. in real terms, that copper prices will
increase at the same rate as international prices generally, and that approxi-
mately two-thirds of the borrowing is on commercial terms (10% p.a. repayable
over 10 years), and the remainder on IBRD terms. The Government recognizes the
need to plan external borrowing to reduce as far as possible the effect of
short-term fluctuations in the copper price on the balance of payments and the
development budget.
PART II: BANK GROUP OPERATIONS
17.          The Bank has made sixteen loans to Zambia and the IFC has
two investments there. Four loans were made for railways and electric
nower before Zambia became independent and are guaranteed by the UK as
well as Zambia.  Since Independence, four loans have been made for agri-
cultu-al development, three for education, two for highways, and two
for power. Total lending to date has been US$339.1 million
(net of cancellations), of which US$198.9 million is for electric power,
US$47.2 million for transportation, US$55.7 million for education, and US$24.8
million for agriculture. Six loans are fully disbursed and the first loan
made in 1953 (No. 74-RN), was repaid in full in February 1972. The IFC made
its first investment in Zambia in February 1972, providing US$1.1 million for
expansion of a shoe manufacturing company. A second IFC investment in the
same company, totalling US$1.2 million, was made in June 1973. As of December
31, 1972, the Bank's share in Zambia's total debt (disbursed and undisbursed)
was 16 percent, while the Bank's share in Zambia's total debt service payments
in 1973 was 12 percent. Present projections indicate that the Bank's share in
Zambia's debt would increase to about 29 percent in 1980, while the Bank's
share in Zambia's debt service would increase to about 38 percent in 1980.
Annex II contains a summary statement of Bank loans and IFC investnents as of
May 31, 197!1, and rotes on the execution of ongoing projects.
18.       Progress on Bank operations in Zambia has been adversely affected
by the difficulties Zambia has faced over the past decade. The Unilateral
Declaration of Independence in Southern Rhodesia in 1965 led Zambia to
sever her close economic ties with Southern Rhodesia at a considerable cost,
disrupting the development program. Shortage of skilled manpower has inter-
fered with progress on some projects, while recent cost escalations have
caused difficulties on others, especially the Kariba North project. Finally,
the sharp fall in copper prices in 1971 and 1972 forced the Government to
rephase capital expenditures on several programs; this affected the Bank's
first education project. The Zambia-Rhodesia border closure created an addi-
tional financial burden, but has not, however, caused significant delays to
Bank-financed projects. Substantial assistance was provided by various bila-
teral sources to help Zambia meet this emergency. To help maintain Zambia's
development effort in the face of these financial problems, the Bank made



available in June 1973 a US$30 million program loan. However, the recent
improvement in Zambia's financial position, caused primarily by the increase
in copper prices over the past year, diminished the need for part of this
loan. In March 1974, after discussions initiated by the Bank, the Govern-
ment requested the cancellation of US$17.5 million of the loan.
19.       We propose to continue assisting Zambia in achieving her develop-
ment objectives. A mixed farming project is presently being prepared and
the Bank is also assisting in formulating proposals for Intensive Develop-
ment Zones (IDZ). While still at the early planning stage, the Bank expects
to assist in the financing of these and other projects (e.g., forestry) in
the agricultural sector. Rapid drift of population to the towns has given
rise to serious urban problems which cannot be ignored; the Bank is respond-
ing to this need with a project scheduled for Board consideration at the
same time as the proposed operation,for the provision of serviced sites for
self-help housing in Lusaka and for the upgrading of squatter settlements.
A oroject for telecommunications development is also being prepared. The
supplementary loan presently under consideration for the Kariba North Project
will help meet cost over-runs experienced during construction of the project.
PART III - THE ELECTRIC POWER SECTOR
20.       The major wholesale supplier of electric power to Zambia and
Southern Rhodesia is the Central African Power Corporation (CAPC), which
owns the Kariba dam and the South Bank power station, and transmits power
from this and other sources over its extensive 330 kv grid in both countries.
CAPC was established, following the dissolution of the Federation of Rhodesia
and Nyasaland in 1963, to be responsible for power production and bulk trans-
mission, and is jointly owned and operated by Zambia and Southern Rhodesia.
The Corporation is controlled by a Higher Authority for Power (HAP) comprising
members from Zambia and Southern Rhodesia - the latter being appointed under
an Order-in-Council of the United Kingdom Government following Southern
Rhodesia's Unilateral Declaration of Independence (UDI) in 1965. In spite of
UDI, the interconnected system is continuing to operate with the support of
all parties. CAPC has remained a viable institution, operating efficiently
and providing substantial benefits and economies to both countries.
21.       CAPC sells power to five companies: two in Zambia and three in
Southern Rhodesia. In Zambia, CAPC sells power to the Copperbelt Power
Company (CPC), owned 51 percent by Government and 49 percent by the Government
controlled mining companies, and to the Zambia Electricity Supply Corporation
Limited (ZESCO), which was set up in 1969 as an entity wholly owned by the
Government to be responsible for all power production in Zambia, except from
the Kariba North Bank power station. ZESCO operates the 600 MW Kafue (Stage I)
hydroelectric station, the 108 14W Victoria Falls hydroelectric power stations
and a few other small thermal, diesel and hydroelectric stations. The Kafue
and Victoria Falls power stations are interconnected to CAPC's power system



- 7 -
and ZESCO sells its entire power production, in bulk, to CAP>. ZESCO purchases
its power from CAPC, in turn, for its consumers throughout Zambia. The copper
mines, which account for 75 percent of the total consumption in Zambia, obtain
their requirements directly from the CAPC system, through CPC.
22.       The growth of demand, generatirng capacity and ernergy production
capability of the interconnected system is depicted in Annexes IV and V.
Presently, 1,884 NW of installed capacity is available to the CAPC intercon-
nected system, but the energy resources are already insufficient to meet the
demand and a period of energy shortages is forecast until the Kariba North
Bank power station is commissiored.
23.       The construction of the Kariba North station is the most economic
source of additional power to meet the existing shortages and growth in de-
mand and, upon completion in 1976, will add 600 MW capacity to the inter-
connected system.  Further generating capacity would be required by 1977,
which would be met by the Kafue II Hydroelectric Project in Zambia (600 MW),
for which the Bank made a loan (919 ZA) to ZESCO in July 1973.
24.       Future development of the interconnected system until 1980 would
consist of (a) the expansion of CAPC's 330 kv transmission system; and (b)
the provision of additional generating capacity. After ZESCO's Kafue Stage
II hydroelectric project is completed, further generating capacity would
most economically and conveniently be met by the third stage of Kafue River
development (450 MW). Planning for the Kafue Stage III project, however, is
only at a preliminary stage. For reasons of national self-sufficiency,
Southern Rhodesia has recently announced a program to construct the Wankie
thermal power station for operation in 1977, although this would not be the
most economic source of power for t.he CAPC system after the Kafue II project.
25.       Bank lending has been a major factor in developing the intercon-
nected system in Zambia and Southern Rhodesia and, in particular, the Kariba
power scheme. The first Bank loan (145 RN) was made in 1956 for the Kariba
dam, the adjacent South Bank power station (600 MW) in Southern Rhodesia,
and the interconnected 330 kv transmission system; a second Bank loan (392 RNS)
was made in 1964 for extending the transmission system; a third (701 ZA) was
made in 1970 for the Kariba North Bank power station, and the proposed second
tranche of this loan would assist in meeting cost overruns encountered in
construction of this station.
26.       The Kariba North Bank Company (KNBC), owned entirely by the Govern-
ment of Zambia, was created to implement the Kariba North Bank station as relations
with Southern Rhodesia. made it infeasible for CAPC to construct the power
station as its owner, which it would normally have done. KNBC is the Borrow-
er for Loan 701 ZA and the owner of the power station. KNBC has appointed
CAPC as its agent to oversee all matters relating to construction of the proj-
ect. After completion of the project, KNBC has also agreed to lease the Kariba



North power station to CAPC, which would operate it as part of the intercon-
necr.ed system. CAPC has, in turn, agreed to pay rent sufficient to cover
.IBC's entire debt service and reasonable administrative costs.   These arrange-
ments would enable the interconnected system to continue to operate as an
effective integrated power system.
PART IV - THE PROJECT
Description and Purpose
27.       A full description of the project was given in my Report (P-843)
of June 24, 1970, recommending the loan to the Kariba North Bank Company
(KNIBC) for a hydroelectric power project. An updated loan and project sum-
mary is attached as Annex III.
28.       The project forms part of the s-heme to utilize the hydroelectric
power potential available at Kariba, estimated at 8,500 GWh annually.    This
scheme began in 1956 with the construction of a dam on the Zambesi River,
a power station (600 MW) on the South Bank in Southern Rhodesia which
generates about 5,250 GWh annually, and a transmission system, which has
subsequently been extended, connecting the South Bank power station with
load centers in Zambia and Southern Rhodesia. The project consists of the
construction of an underground power station on the North Bank of the Zambesi
River, with an installed capacity Qf 600 MW, provided by four 150 MW turbo-
generators. The station will match the generating capacity of the South
Bank station, but has been designed so that its capacity could ultimately
be increased to 900 MW.
Construction of the Project
29.       Sir Alexander Gibb & Partners (Gibb), who were the civil. engineering
consultants on the Kariba dam, have been retained as consultants on the civil
works for Kariba North. Merz & McLellan have been engaged as the electrical
and nmechanical consultants. The main civil works contract for the project
was awarded in January 1971 to the Mitchell Construction Kinnear Moodie Group
(Mitchell) of the United Kingdom, who was the lowest bidder at K20.5 million.
All bids were substantially higher than the estimate of about KTh.0 million,
inclusive of contingencies, made by the consultants, Gibb, in 1968, and used
as the appraisal estimate in 1970.
30.       Mitchell started construction of the main civil works in April 1971,
and initially made satisfactory progress. However, the rate of progress
slowed down considerably from March 1972, with implications for serious delays
in the erection and commissioning of the generating units, the first of which



- 9 -
was scheduled for operatior. in July 1974. Differences arose between Mitchell,
Gibb and KNBC on the causes of the slow down, on claims for increased cost,
and on contract performance. Efforts to resolve these differences
vere unsuccessful.
31.       During the period from October 1972 to January 1973, intensive efforts
were made by the Government, in consuLtation with the Bank and other parties con-
cerned, to settle the issues arising out of the main civil works contract, but no
agreement was reached. On Januatry 25, 1973, Mitchell informed KNEC that work
at the site, which by then was moving at a very slow pace, would be suspended
on January 31. On that date, Mitchell went into receivership and the Govern-
ment immediately took over the site.
32.       Claims and counterclaims under the Mitchell contract have been
asserted by the parties involved.   KNBC is taking steps in respect of its
claims which involve possible recoaery under a performance bond.    It is
expected that, in due course, the courts will establish responsibilities
and liabilities in the case. 1/
Selection of New Civil Works Contractor
33.       After Mitchell went into receivership, the Government, in consulta-
tion with the Bank, initiated discussions on the alternative courses of action
and their respective costs and implications to determine the most appropriate
course of action for completing the project. A new round of competitive
bidding was not tried in view of the high cost of delays, estimated at
K 1.2 million per month. Negotiation with a single contractor, selected
from among those who originally bid for the civil works contract, was agreed
to be the most economic course of action. The Government selected Energoprojekt,
a Yugoslav contractor who had satisfactorily completed the Kafue Stage I Proj-
ect in 1971 and had thus attracted the confidence of the Government. Moreover,
this firm was willing to mobilize immediately and complete the Kariba North
project to specific targets. The Bank concurred with this selection.
34.       Energoprojekt undertook to complete the civil works according to
new targets determined by Gibb. The targets called for entry to be granted
to the electrical works contractor by December 15, 1973 and commissioning of
the first generating unit in October 1975.
35.       Energoprojekt also agreed to negotiate a new contract based on its
original unsuccessful tender in 1970 but appropriately adjusted to account for
changes in economic circumstances since the awarding of the original contract.
Mobilization began in May 1973 and work was restarted on the basis of an interim
arrangement. A new unit price contract was signed in November 1973.
1/   Additional details are given in Annex VI (para. 5).

Per:hormance of the New Contractor
36.       Energoprojekt has brought in adequate construction equipment and
sufficient expatriate personnel for operation on a three shift basis. Its
methods of construction and maintenance of constructon equipment are effizient
and there is now confidence in achieving the target of comms8iioning the f:Erst
generating unit by October 15, 1975, sixteen months later than tne originai.
target date.
37.       Initially, Energoprojekt concentrated its work on the two critical
sections of the project - viz., (a) the machine hall and (b) the tailrace
outfal1. Good progress has been achieved in these two areas. The power
house cavern has been excavated to the loading bay level. Excavation to the
turbine pits is in brisk progress. Access was provided to the generating
plant contractor according to schedule on December 15, 1973, earning Energo-
projekt its first bonus. Work is now proceeding well in all areas.
Administration
38.       CAPC has felt hampered in the fulfillment of its role as agent
because of the restrictions the border closure has placed on the movement of
its staff. However, CAPC and the Government are presently discussing possible
arrangements that should permit specified CAPC personnel access over the Kariba
dam to the site.  To expedite decisions, the Government has appointed its
Permanent Secretary, Ministry of Transport, Power & Works as Chairman Qf the
KNBC, and has provided KNBC with a fulU time Secretary who has been familiar with
the project from inception.
Effect of Closure of the Zambian-Southern Rhodesian Border
39.       In 1971, suppliers of the permanent plant and equipment for the
project chose the Beira-Southern Rhodesia rail and road route for transport
to the Kariba dam. The closure of the Zambian-Southern Rhodesiar. border in
February 1973 necessitated rerouting of this equipment.   Initially the Bank
was informed that heavy equipment required for the Kariba North project would
be exempt from the Zambian embargo on the use of the Beira-Southern Rhodesia
route, but the Government decided in March 1974 that only equipment which had al-
ready reached Southern Rhodesia would be allowed to continue using that route. The
project consultant, in consultation with the suppliers of equipment, transporta-
tion authorities, and agencies concerned, then prepared a program for rerouting
the heavy equipment, via either the Dar-es-Salaam (Tanzania) road route or the
Lobito Bay (Angola) rail and road route, that would ensure deliveries at site
without further delays and in accordance with construction requirements. The
cost of this rerouting has been estimated at US$5.4 million, of which US$5.0
million represents the foreign cost.
Project Costs
40.       The Bank's original $40.0 million loan (701-ZA), which became ef-
fective on January 11, 1971, represented the estimated foreign exchange costs



of the project in 1970 when the total cost, including interest during con-
struction, was estimated at K40.7 million (US$57.1 million equivalent). The
total project cost is now estimated at K90.4 million (US$1h0.6 million
equivalent). Of the total, foreign exchange costs represent K56.0 million
(US$87.1 million) and local costs K34.4 million (US$53.5 million). To meet
the cost increase, supplementary financing of US$47.1 million equivalent in
foreign exchange and K21.4 million in local currency is required (in addition
to a Government grant of KO.9 million).
41.       The cost estimates, at the time of appraisal (April 1970) and at
preseni:, are summarised in Annex VI, together with notes on the basis of the
present cost estimate and causes of the :ost increases. The cost estimates
are now based entirely on contracts awarded or decided. Costs have increased
on preliminary works by 131 percent, engineering by 99 percent, electrical and
mechanical equipment by 44 percent and civil works by 219 percent - those on
the civil works being the most significant. The chief reasons for the cost
increases are:
(a) bids received for civil works and electrical and mechanical
plant were higher than the appraisal estimates;l/
(b) Mitchell's failure, the subsequent change of contractor,
and consequent construction delays; and
(c) world-wide price inflation after bids were received.
In our best judgement, the increases in costs can be attributed as follows:
1/   In my memorandum R71-5 of January 11, 1971, I informed the Executive
Directors that bids received for the project had resulted in substantially
higher estimates of project costs than those which had been used to deter-
mine the amount of the loan and that I intended to propose a supplementary
loan of some $11.0 million for the Kariba North project in order to fi-
nance the full foreign exchange requirements.

Justification
L2.           The project cost, excluding interest during construction, now stands
at K123 per kW installed. Considering that the capital cost of a new thermal
station in Zambia would be about K220 per kilowatt installed, the Kariba North
B?nk hydroelectric station still represents the least cost alternative for
expansion of generating capacity of the CAPC interconnected system. The cost of
ene-rgy production from Kariba North would also continue to represent the lowest
of all available alternatives.
1t3.         The rate of return on the project, calculated on the basis of
revised project costs and expected revenues of CAPC, is 1 percent. This is
only slightly lower than the rate of return originally calculated for the
project since revenues are now expected to be substantially larger than
originally forecast.

44.          The Government has agreed to provide Kj.2 (MS$5.0) million, on. terms
satisfactory to the Bank, to cover the foreign cost of the rerouting of heavy
equipment (para. 39). The proposed second tranche of loan 701 ZA would finance
the balance of the additional foreign exchange costs of $42.1 million.
45.          With respect to the local costs, the original Loan Agreement between
CAPC and KNBC,signed in December 1970, called for a loan by CAPC of K13.0 million
at an interest rate of 7 percent per annum to cover all local costs, including
interest during construction. When it first became apparent that there would be
substantial cost overruns, CAPC agreed in principle to increase its loan to
K20 million, subject to the condition that the Bank would make a supplementary
loan to cover the additional foreign costs. Il accordance with this earlier
agreement, CAPC has reaffirmed its intention to increase its loan to K20.0 million.
46.          The Government has also agreed to lend KNBC an amount of K13.5
million, at an interest rate of 7-3/4 percent, to cover the gap in local cost
financing; this is in addition to approximately KO.9 million the Government has
already made available to KNBC in the form of grants. The Government loan to
KNBC would be substantially refinanced by a proposed loan to the Government of
about K13.0 million from the Commonwealth Development Corporation (CDC) that
would be made specifically for the purpose of constructing the Kariba North project.
47.          The revised financing plan for the project, in summary, would be as
follows :l/

49.       CAPC's financial position is sound.   Its balance sheet is summarized
in Annex VII. In FY73, the rate of return on average net fixed assets in
operation (before interest but after depreciation) was 8.7 percent, This
return has permitted CAPC to develop the transmission network defined in its
loan covenants to the Bank and to generate a substantial portion of the cost
of the Kariba North Bank station. CAPC cannot transfer funds freely between
Zambia and Southern Rdodesia, as only overhead adjustments are authorized.
As a result, on a cash basis, the operations in Zambia and Southern Rhodesia
are distinct. So far, CAPC has been able to balance its revenues and expendi-
tures separately in the two countries, but it will not be able to do this
after 1977.
50.       In view of the restriction on transfer of funds, separate cash flow
projections were prepared for CAPC's operations in Zambia and Southern Rhodesia
up to FY1976/77. 1/ They indicate that CAPC's cash position in each country
would be sound in that period and that CAPC would be able to generate suf-
ficient funds in Zambia to disburse fully its K7.0 million supplementary loan
to KNBC by June 30, 1976.      In FY1976/77, CAPC would be able to meet the
first rent payment for the Kariba North power station.
51.       It is not possible to make firm forecasts beyond 1977 as agreements
have not been reached on the amounts to be paid for purchases of power by CAPC
from either KAFUE II or the projected Wankie thermal plant in Southern
Rhodesia (para. 2b). Indeed, some uncertainty enshrouds the CAPC system after
1977. The two main alternatives are: (1) the CAPC system could remain fully
interconnected between the two countries and operated on sound economic
principles, taking its supplies from the cheapest available sources; or (2) the
CAPC system could effectively cease, requiring each country to operate on a
national basis only. The former alternative would require free transfers of
funds betweer. the two countries to meet cash deficits in Zambia, since hydro-
electric generation in Zambia would, if interconnections of new power sources
based on sound economic principles continued, constitute the preferred and
main source of energy for CAPC. However, even if these problems should not be
resolved and the CAPC system should split, sufficient revenues would be
generated by the Zambian market alone at prevailing tariffs to meet all debt
service obligations of the Kafue and Kariba projects.
Release of Additional Guarantees
52.       The original arrangements contemplated for financing the second
stage of the Kariba scheme envisaged a Bank loan to CAPC, with Zambia guaranteeing
half the loan and Southern Rhodesia the other half, but relations with Southern
1/  ANNEX VII gives cash flow projections for CAPC in Zambia and Southerr
Rhodesia.

Rhodesia made this course impossible. All concerned agreed, however, that
Zambia should not be required to incur a greater liability for this project
Uhan it would have incurred under the original arrangements.   The United
Kingdom, which continues to be the ultimate guarantor for the earlier Bank
loans for the Kariba scheme, accordingly agreed that the Bank should release
Zambia from a part of its obligations as guarantor of loans 185-RN and
392-RNS. A release of guarantees arrangement was therefore devised for
loan 701 ZA in order that Zambia's guarantee responsibility would be limited
to 50 percent of the total of Bank loans for the Kariba scheme.
53.       Additional releases of Zambian guarantees in respect of the two
earlier loans need to be made in view of the necessity for a large supple-
mentary Bank loan. Arrangements have been made to relieve Zambia of all pay-
ments under the earlier loans beginning with the December 1, 1972 payment in
respect of loan 145-RN. However, even with the additional releases, the
portions of the loans available to be released will not be sufficient
to maintain the 50% guarantee sharing arrangement, and Zambia will be re-
quired to carry about 53% of the burden of guarantees for the full Kariba scheme.
PART V - LEGAL INSTRUMENTS AND AUTHORITY
.-IJ.     The draft Amending Loan Agreement between the Bank, KNBC and the
Republic of Zambia, the draft Amending Release Agreement between the United
Kingdom, the Republic of Zambia and the Bank, the Report of the Committee
provided for in Article III, Section 4(iii) of the Articles of Agreement, the
text of a resolution approving the proposed supplemental loan and the text of
a resolution approving the proposed amended guarantee release arrangements are
being distributed to the Executive Directors separately. Zambia's guarantee
X under loan 701-ZA would extend to the proposed supplemental loan.
55.       A draft Loar, Amendirg Agreement between CAPC and KNBC,   d a draft
Loan Agreement between the Republic of Zambia and KNBC have bee   agreed.   The
signing of these documents would be a condition of effectivene s for the proposed
supplemental loan.
56.       I am satisfied that the proposed supplemental loan would comply with
the Articles of Agreement of the Bank.

C.   Projects in Execution 1/
Loan No. 56f2-ZA - Industrial Forestry Proj ect: US$5.3 million loan of
October 5, 1968; (losing Date: June 30, 1977
Execution of the project is making more rapid -rogress than expected
at the time of appraisal. However, there are several staff Vacancies which
aives cause for some concern. We have suggested that government seek technical
assistance from bilateral sources until qualified Zambian accountants become
available. Project costs have proved to be higher than expected.
Loan No. 592-ZA - First Education Project: US$17.4 million loan of
ADril 11, 1969; Closing Date: September 30, 1974
As a result of, inter alia, prolonged negotiations with the archi-
tectural consultants a reduction in 1972 of budget allocations due to decline
in cooper prices, and poor management in the early stages of project implement-
ation, the project is about 2-1/2 years behind schedule. Progress in project
implementation is now proceeding satisfactorily. To allow for the completion
of the project, the original September 30, 1974 Closing Date is proposed to
be extended to March 30, 1977.
Loan No. 627-ZA - Livestock Development Project: US$2.5 million loan of
June 30, 1969; Closing Date: November 30, 1974
The project has run into serious management and financial problems.
The Government has recently decided that the scope of the project should be
drastically amended. Discussions on this matter are in progress.
Loan No. 645-ZA - Second Education Project; US$5.3 million loan of
November 30, 1969; Closing Date: August 31, 1973
Construction work, procurement of furniture and equipment has
basically been completed. Recent cost estimates indicate an expected savings
of about US$0.50 million in loan proceeds. Delays in the initial implementa-
tion stage caused by, inter alia, building material shortages and limited
managerial capacity of certain civil works contractors resulted in an extension
of the original Closing Date of August 31, 1973, by about 16 months. The
project is expected to be completed by the revised December 31, 1974 Closing
Date.
1/   These notes are designed to inform the Executive Directors regarding the
progress of projects in execution, and in particular to report any problems
which are being encountered and the action being taken to remedy them.
They should be read in this sense, and with the understanding that they
do not purport to present a balanced evaluation of strengths and weak-
nesses in project execution.

Loan No. 685-ZA - Commercial Crops Farming Project: US$5.5 million loan of
June 5, 1970; Closing Date: December 31, 1975
Loan No. 882-ZA - Integrated Family Farming Project: US$11.5 million loan of
February 28, 1973.   Closing Date:  June 30, 1979
Physical development of both the Cormmercial Crops and Family Farming
Projects is satisfactory and benefits realized by farmers are up to or exceed
expectations.  However, the Tobacco Board of Zambia (TBZ) which is respons-
ible for project implementation, faces difficult problems due to staff short-
ages and deficiencies in its accounting orgarnization. Costs of both projects
slightly exceed appraisal estimates. Disbursements on the Commercial Crops
Project are close to appraisal estimates but no requests for withdtawal have
yet been submitted for the Family Farming Project.
Loan No. 701-ZA - Kariba North Project: Us$40.0 million loan of July 29.
1970; Closing Date: July 1, 1976
Loan No. 900-ZA - Third Education Project: US$33.0 million loan of June 6,
1973; Closing Date: September 30, 1979
Problems in recruitment of staff for two of the three Project Units
are creating some initial delays in project implementation. Work implemented
by the Project Unit previously established under the First Education Project
(Loan 592-ZA) is proceeding on schedule with numerous civil works contracts
awarded as a result of the utilization of previously approved standardized
drawing and tender documents. Due to the early stage of project implement-
ation, it is likely that time lost in recruitment of Project Unit staff will
be overcome during the overall project implementation period.
Loan 911-ZA - Program Loan: US$30.0 million loan of June 18, 1973;
Closing Date: June 30, 1974
In March 1974 the Government requested the cancellation of US$17.5
million of the loan. The cancellation was made effective on March 14, 1974.
Loan No. 919-ZA - Kafue Hydroelectric Prolect (Stage II): US$115 million
loan of July 16, 1973; Closing Date: December 31, 1979
The preliminary works, such as access roads and camps, are now
substantially complete. Construction of the main civil works started in
June 1973 and is proceeding satisfactorily.

PROCUREMENT
ARRANGEMENTS:    Goods and services required for the project have so far
been procured through international competitive bidding,
except for the new civil works contract with Energo-
project (Yugoslavia), and items involving expenditures
of less than US$10,300, which are being procured on the
basis of other procadures approved by the Bank. After
the failure of Mitchell (United Kingdom), who won the civil

PROJECT COSTS
1.        The costs of the project, at thle time of appraisal and at present,
are summarized on page 4 of this annex for comparison.
Notes on the New Cost Estimate
2'.       The estimate for completion of the Kariba North project is now
based entirely on contracts awarded or decided. Substantial disbursements
have already been made under various contracts since 1970 in different cur-
rencies and exchange rates and these amounts have been suitably adjusted to
take into account the subsequent variations in exclhange rates. 1/
3.        The estimates for the electrical and mechanical works are based on
the contract value of equipment ordered, the agreed modifications and t'ne pro-
visions for increases (or decreases) in costs at prevailing exchange rates.
Tlte increases in costs arising out of civil works construction delays, in-
creases in transportation and storage costs, and the cost of acceleration
of erection of turbines have also been included. Additional provisions have
been made for physical and price contingencies which we believe are adequate,
considering the fact that the escalation admissible on these contracts is
linmited and most of the payments for equipment would be completed by mid-1975.
4.        The civil works estimate is based on completed preliminary works,
actual nayments made under the Mitchell contract and the agreement with
Energoprojekt on the main civil works contract, which is subject to changes
based on actual measurements (due to physical variations) and likely claims.
5.        The estimate makes no allowance for claims arising out of termina-
tion of the Mitchell contract, because it is not possible at this time to
assess the outcome of the litigation that is now expected to ensue. Mlitchell
througii its Liquidator has asserted substantial claims (unspecified as to
amount) against KUBC (a) for sums allegedly due under the contract before
its terminatiotn, and (b) for damages for breach of contract.   Such clains
have subsequently been confirmed by Mitchell's Receiver and rejected by IKNMC.
K'BC in turn has asserted claims against iMitchell for breachl of contract
(alleging damages of approximately K25 million), and against 'iitchell's
1/   All contract prices have been denominated in Zanibian Kwacha.   KNBC,
whiclh is advised by the Bank of the amount charged to thte loan account
in US dollars when each disbursement is made, converts it into Kwacha
at the ruling parity rate. The parity rate from the beginning of tlle
project construction to February 13, 1973, was K1=US$1.4; since then
it has been K1=US$1.555.   The cost estimates, however, have been ad-
justed to reflect changes in exchange rates since thie time of disburse-
ment, since the payments from KNBC to the Bank will be made in the
same currencies as those disbursed.

sureties under its performance bond (in the face amount of about
Kb.] million).  Mitchell and its sureties have rejected KNBC's claims,
and the sureties have indicated their intention to seek indemnity from
Gibb, the Engineer, on the grounds of misrepresentation by Gibb of the
rock conditions, for any liability established against them. According
to advice of Mitchell's Liquidator to creditors, Mitchell's estimated
assets available for distribution to unsecured creditors would be about
Lv5 million (US$3.15 million), whereas total unsecured claims (not
including KNBC's claims) amounted to about W7.82 million (US$18.0 million).
Thus, even on the basis of the most optimistic assumptions, KNBC could
recover from Mitchell only a small portion of its losses arising out of
the termination of the Mitchell contract, and as a practical matter, its
principal source of any recovery would be Mitchell's sureties, as to which
any recovery would be limited to the approximately K4.1 million face
amount of its performance bond. All claims and counterclaims having been
formally rejected, it is probable that the issues will be litigated in
the courts of the United Kingdom (where KNBC can obtain jurisdiction over
the parties involved). The case turns essentially on a series of complex
factual and engineering issues which are hotly disputed by the parties,
and accordingly, it is expected that a final resolution is several years
away.
6.        In regard to contingencies for civil works, tile Engineer has pro-
vided for physical contingencies at 5 percent, which is considered adequate
considering the present position of the work, with most of the excavations
conmpleted and little uncertainty in the nature and quantities of work.   In
addition, a price contingency of about 15 percent of the remaining payments
iias Deen provided to cover escalation, likely changes in exchange rates and
marginal delays in project construction.   As construction work is proceeding
well, no allowances have been made for extraordinary delays.
Reasons for Cost Increases
7.        At the time of appraisal, the cost of the main civil works of the
project, inclusive of contingencies, was estimated at about K14.0 million.
This estimate (of April 1970) was the same as an estimate prepared by Gibb
in November 1968. The Gibb estimate was based on contract rates for simi-
lar work awarded in 1967 for the Kafue (Stage I) hydroelectric project. When
t.enders were received for Kariba civil works late in 1970, the two bidders
who had direct experience of construction of large projects in Zambia - Torno
of Italy on the Kariba South Project and Energoprojekt of Yugoslavia on the
Kafue (Stage I) Project - had quoted K24.2 and K24.9 respectively for this
work. It was apparent then that the appraisal estimate had not taken into
account (a) the world-wide rising trends in construction costs since 1968,
and (b) the actual experiences of the Kafue contract.



ANNEX VI
Page 3 of 4
8.        The project has borne the full costs incurred on the Mitchell con-
tract, and the additional burdens of mobilization through the new contractor,
Energoprojekt. Inclusive of a net construction plant advance of K2.55 million
given by the Employer, and other payments outside of the contract, Mitchell
had been paid K13.4 million at the time of termination of its work, with only
30 percent of the work having been completed.   According to the Engineer,
Gibb, Energoprojekt's contract value of K24.9& million for completing the
rest of the work was about 10 percent on the high side, bzut this had to be
accepted in the difficult situation that had arisen after '.Mtchell's failure.
9.        The cost of preliminary works has also registered an increase of
131 percent. The 1968 estimate, used for appraisal, had assumed that housing,
hospital and other facilities available on the South bank, in Southern Rhodesia,
would be available. GRZ's decision that the project had to be self-sufficient
on the North bank in these respects caused the increase ifn these costs. The
costs of engineering are based on contracts and on supervision costs actually
incurred or expected to be incurred. These increases, to a large extent, are
the inevitable consequences of Mitchell's failure and the delays in construc-
tion.
10.       The total increase in cost of electrical and mechanical works is
44 percent. Bids received in 1970 for the main generating plant, transformers
and switchgear were about 30 percent higher than the appraisal estimates.
These costs have increased further due to escalation and changes in exchange
rates of some of the foreign currencies involved. Delays in construction of
the civil works and provision for storage of some manufactured items have
also contributed to the total increase.
