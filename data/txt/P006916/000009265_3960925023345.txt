PROJECT COMPLETION REPORT
COSTA RICA
INDUSTRIAL CREDIT PROJECT
(LOAN 1599-CR)
PREFACE
This report presents an evaluation of the results achieved under
the Bank's first Industrial Credit Project in Costa Rica (Loan 1599-CR).
The US$15 million loan in support of a number of institutional and
industrial sector objectives was made to the Central Bank of Costa Rica
(CBCR) which established a second tier facility, Fondo de Desarrollo
Industrial (FODEIN), to channel Bank and counterpart resources to small and
medium scale industrial, agro-industrial and export projects presented by
participating financial intermediaries. The loan was appraised in February
1978, approved and signed in July 1978. However, it became effective only
in September 1980 and the first authorizations of subloans were finally
granted by the Bank in July 1981 (three years after loan signing) after
interest rate issues were resolved. The loan was fully committed in
October 1984 and fully disbursed in February 1986 some four years behind
the original schedule. While the Bank did not make a follow up loan for
FODEIN, its operations continue to benefit from the use of the US$15
million (equivalent) in counterpart funds and reflows. The Interamerican
Development Bank (IDB) expects to grant a loan to the Government of Costa
Rica in mid-1988 to support FODEIN's institutional development and
financing for the industrial sector.
The Project Completion Report (PCR) was prepared by the Bank's
Latin American and Caribbean Country Department II following a country
visit in January 1988. The PCR draws on the staff Appraisal and Presidents
Reports, loan documents and the project files. The report presents a
factual review of the operations of the project, the extent to which the
main objectives of the program were achieved, the uses to which FODEIN's
loan resources were put and the results of the investments made. A Project
Completion Report, which included a substantial data base on project
performance and status, was received from the Borrower.
The assistance and cooperation received from the Government, the
CBCR, FODEIN, participating financial intermediaries and other agencies and
enterprises during the project completion mission is greatly appreciated.
The Borrower's comments have been received and included in t_e report and
are attached as Annex 3.
This project has not jeen audited by the Operations Evaluation
Department.

La  In addition, the borrower's outstanding balance to the Bank includes
US$6.5 million in accrued exchange risk adjustments. Thus, the total
outstanding balance on Lean 1599-CR currently is US$15.9 million.
Lb The Board approved an amendment to the loan agreement on August 3,
1982 under which up to US$5 million of the US$15 million loan could be
used for pre-export financing. US$3 million were ultimately used for
such purposes.
/c While conditions of effectiveness were met in 09180, outstanding
interest rate issues were not resolved until 06/81. The Loan did
therefore not become operational until mid-July 1981 when a new
structure of interest rates was put in place for FODEIN and the Bank
agreed to authorize initial withdrawals from the Loan Account.

PROJECT COMPLETION REPORT
COSTA RICA
INDUSTRIAL CREDIT PROJECT
(LOAN 1599-CR)
EVALUATION SUMMARY
1.       Soon after the Loan became effective in 1980, Costa Rica's economy
faltsred and plunged for a range of reasons includings  deepening foreign
trade imbalances, foreign exchange constraints, declining domestic demand,
high public sector expenditures, credit restraints to the private sector
and interest and exchange rate policie. that hampered resource mobilization
and encouraged capital flight.  By 1982-83 Costa Rica was in the midst of a
deep recession, exasperated by hyper-inflation and the deep foreign
exchange and political problems e5Tertenced by CACM trading partners
(paras. 1.03-1.04). By late 1983 Costa Rica had brought inflation under
control and with the assistance or substantial external aid had reduced its
short term foreign exchange problems to what appeared to be manageable
proportions. It was in this general environment of uncertainty, change and
disruption of traditional CACM relationships that the subprojects financed
under the Loan were appraised and implemented.
2.       After a three-year delay in project start-up and an amendment to
the loan agreement which provided for short term working capital financing
for pre-export operations, Bank funds were committed and disbursed, under
this initial industrial credit project, for 34 investment subprojects and
26 pre-export credits. Investment subprojects varied considerably from the
expected with respect to: size of enterprises and subprojects, employment
effects and geographic location of subprojects (paras. 3.05-3.07). Beyond
that, several unpredicted political and economic events affected b-oth the
financial outcome of many subprojects and the achievements of key
institutional objectives. These events, however, also enablea the Bank to
provide an important input to national deliberations and decisions
regarding interest rate policy under the Loan which in turn had broader
positive effects on financial sector policy (para. 2.08).
3.       A relatively high 30? of the Bank financed investment subprojects
have experienced serious operational and financial difficulties. Half of
these projects are in liquidation or have closed down their operations.
The other half are operating but with difficulties and at low capacity
utilization. Ten percent of total companies financed are operating
adequately but below forecast. Ultimately some of these subprojects may
fail (para. 3.12). This high failure rate occurred despite the detailed
subproject appraisal procedures in place and the high percentage (60Z), of
total subprojects revieved by the Bank. The major shortfall in subproject
preparation and analysis was in the areas of marketing and distribution
research and analysis (para 3.14). The mechanics of analysis and
estimation of production costs, macro-demand, economic rate of return or
financial rates of return were adequate, reflecting the Bank's contribution



- vi -
by establishing technical assistanceltraining programs and carrying out a
large number of free limit subproject reviews (paras. 4.03-4.04).
4.       The portfolio losses experienced by the participating financial
intermediaries (PFI) were lower than would be expected given the high
percentage of subprojects that closed or are classified as operating with
difficulty as borrowers have been striving to repay their obligations
(para. 3.12). Currentl1 252 of loans (equal to 281 of the unpaid loan
amc(mt) are in arrears.    However, most arrears are short term
delinquencies as only 6Z of loans are in arrears for over 180 days. Two
failed subprojects have fully repaid their obligations. One operation in
difficulty has totally refinanced its debt using AID resources and has
cancelled FODEIN debt. Others have increased their capital contributions
and are striving to work their way out of difficulty. Many entrepreneurs
are struggling, and with some success, to work their way out of trouble.
Many of the companies hard hit by CACM's problems have begun to seek export
oppertunities in the USA and elsewhere.
5.       The project, as appraised, provided PFI with a gross financial
spread of 3 points for all loans except for SSE2 credits on which one
additional point was added. The basic spread was raised to 4.5 points for
all loans in August 1981 when the higher interest rate schedules were
approved. Even with the higher spread basis, all but the most efficient
financial intermediary would lose money on the operation, given the low 7
to 1 DIE leverage ratio required by the project (Annex 2). PFI
participation was restricted and highly concentrated in one PFI that
accounted for 802 of investment projects.
6.       Institutional development objectives were clearly met for FODEIN,
the apex institution, which has emerged from the project as a sound, well
managed, staffed and financed facility, that is now able to attract
external resources. institutional development objectives were not achieved
for PFI as few provisions were made to help P1I to upgrade their capacity
to assist clients prepare projects or to appraise or supervise projects in
line with standards set for the project (para. 4.04). Slow disbursement
after mid 1981, when the final interest rate issue was resolved, and the
bias toward large projects were a direct outcome of the low financial
spreads and the excessively bureaucratic procedures established for the
project. An intrusive role was assigned to FODEIN under the project
(para. 4.04) and three of the four possible PFI would not actively
participate until 1986-87 when procedures were simplified.
1/ As of June 1987, only 81 of portfolio was in arrears. Since then
arrears expanded dramatically to 202 as credit conditions have
tightened sharply and many borrowers are paying interest but not
principal on their loans.
2/ An SSE was defined as an enterprise with not more than US$150,000 in
capital (equal to US$450,000 in total assets besed on a 2 to 1 D/E
ratio which would be an ample definition of SSE in the Costa Rica
context in 1978). The appraisal did not anticipate financing micro-
enterprise and anticipated a minimum SSE loan size of US$25,000.



- vii -
7.       An SSE subloen Guarantee Facility was established, as a condition
of loan effectiveness, to compensate PFI for up to 30S of the outstanding
principal amount of the PFI's subloan. This facility, which was to be a
main institutional feature of the loan, vas not used by the PFI for the 3
subprojects that could have met the ample definition of SSE. An AID
financed Credit Guarantee Scheme was instrumented by an AID Project
Agreement signed on February 26, 1979. It offered 75Z coverage on loan
defaults (compared with the Bank's 30Z).3 It was, however, geared to
service a target group of micro and very small urban and agricultural
enterprise not expected to be reached under the Bank loan.
8.       FODEIN established an AID financed SSE credit facility (based upon
three AID credit line equal to US$10.8 million) which were disbursed during
1980-86 for about 6,525 small credits averaging about $1,750 (para. 3.08).
The AID project was not in competition for the larger scale SSE and medium
size subprojects the Bank hoped to finance. The Bank project's failure to
reach the SSE and medium scale projects resulted in higher average costs of
job created and substantially fewer jobs created than were expected
(paras. 3.06-3.07). The average size investment subproject under Loan
1599-CR was US$1,331,000 and the loan proved to be mainly a large scale
industry credit project. FODEIN did not act to aggressively promote
smaller, more labor intensive projects as they were not alerted to such
requirements.
3/ The AID Guarantee Scheme initiated in 1980 proved to be difficult to
efficiently manage and AID refinanced the project in 1983 and
strengthened the administration and provided technica) assistance in
project preparation. A detailed audit of the AID Guarantee Program
indicated that most projects failed to achieve intended results (e.g.
30S of borrower had disappeared, 302 used funds for purposes other than
intended). The technical assistance process, that was a feature of the
loan, generally resulted in larger loans than initially contemplated.

I. BACKGROUND AND HISTORY
Industrial Sector Lending Activity
1.01     Loan 1599-CR represented a renewal of Bank support for Costa
Rica's industrial sector which it had not assisted since the early 1960's
when the Bank made two loans designed to help finance imports of industrial
machinery and equipment (Loan 254-CR for US$2 million in May 1960 and Loan
296-CR for US$3 million in September 1961). Both loans were fully and
quickly disbursed for their limited objectives. Bank financing under Loan
1599-CR was intended to complement ongoing or planned lending programs of
the Interamerican Development Bank (IDB) and the United e Ates Agency for
International Development (AID). In 1976 the IDB made a Industrial loan
of US$8 million to the Banco de Costa Rica. While tbe U .5 million com-
ponent reserved for larger enterprise was fully committed by early 1978,
the small scale industry component moved slowly. In early 1978, AID
prepared a San Jose Urban Development Credit that included financial and
technical assistance to small craftsmen. In February 1979, AID signed an
agreement with the Central Bank of Costa Rica (CBCR) and four major finan-
cial institutions to establish a production credit guarantee program (PCGP)
designed to encourage lending to small scal' enterprise. AID also provided
US$10.8 million from 1980 through 1984 to bapport SSE operations through on
SSE lending facility in FODEIN.
Macroeconomic Setting and Sector Performance
1.02     In the years prior to the appraisal of the Industrial Credit
Project in 1978, Costa Rica had achieved a sound balance between high per
capita GNP growth and social development. Real growth in agriculture was
an impressive 5.4? during the preceding decade and a half. Industry, which
accounted for 202 of GDP, 12? of employment and 27? of total exports was
the fastest growing sector with an average annual real growth rate of 8.12
in 1972-1976 and 112 in 1977. Manufacturing exports lead overall sector
growth mainly because of sharply increasing exports to the Central American
Common Market (CACM), generous fiscal incentives, tax credit certificates
(CAT) for non-traditional exports and absence of restrictions on private
foreign investment. Industrial enterprises were mainly small (702 of the
registered 2,867 enterprises had less than 10 workers, only 10? had more
than 50 workers) and mainly located around San Jose. The composition of
industrial production had been essentially static for a decade. Food,
beverages and tobacco accounted for about half of industrial value added
(Annex 1, Table 2). Industrial employment had been growing at 6.52 I a. in
the decade peior to the loan which was expected to help support an even
higher planned 7.5Z p.a. employment growth rate.



1.03     Starting in late 1980, as Loan 1599-CR became effective, Costa
Rica's economy deteriorated as prices for its main agricultural exports
fell and the price of its main impirt, petroleum, continued to increase
sharply. GDP increased only 1? in 1980. Balance of payments and debt
service problems emerged for almost all CACM countries in 1981-82 and ex-
ports to CACM dropped below their 1980 levels. Foreign credit problems
increased e"d wide variations in foreign exchange rates (in the range of
08.6 and M2s.0 per dollar) prevailed during the year and fostered
uncertainty in the import sensitive industrial sector. Foreign exchange
reserves and credit declined sharply and import compression and sharp
devaluation fueled inflation which rose from 18.1Z in 1980 to over 90? in
1982.
1.04     Industrial output fell by more than lOX in 1981-82 and total
employment dropped below the 1980 level. Reflecting credit restraints,
uncertainty and excess capacity, industrial investment in 1980 fell 15Z
below the previous year's level. This was followed by further reductions
of 28Z in 1981 and at least 20? in 1982. In 1983, the Government launched
an economic recovery and stabilization effort centered around a reduction
of the public deficit and the rate of growth of credit to the private sec-
tor and foreign debt restructuring. Owing in part to the recovery of com-
modity export prices, this effort succeeded.1 During 1983-83, the economy
recovered further as domestic demand expanded at an average rate of almost
24Z. With low inflation, interest rates had historically not been a major
issue in Costa Rica. Starting in 1981, however, the CBCR's administered
interest rates turned sharply negative (Annex 1, Table 3) and recovered
only in mid-i983.
Finacial Institutions
1.05     At the time of appraisal, Costa Rica's financial sector consisted
of (i) the national banking system, which included the CBCR, four nation-
alized, Government owned commercial banks and CODESA, a public development
bank, and (ii) institutions outside the nati.onal bankitg system, including
4 private foreign banks and 30 private financieras that accounted for only
24Z of industrial lending. Currently, the banking system consists of the
regulated sector--four Government-owned commercial banks, CODESA, and 17
private commercial banks--and the unregulated components, wh-ich include 56
financieras, 50 financial co-operative associations, 7 savings and loan
associations and a public insurance company. In 1978, only the national
banks could discount, rediscount or borrow from CBCR. Private banks were
granted access to international lending agency credit facilities only in
late 1985. Then, as now, only government-owned banks have the right to
mobilize resources at maturities shorter than six months. This barrier to
short-term, lower cost, deposit seeking was designed to suppress pr.vate
sector banking growth and it has helped the Government banks to maintain
1/ Currently Costa Rica's rate of inflation is about 15? and its trade
deficit at 1.52 of GDP is among the lowest in LAC.

their resource base.2 Government policy has not helped public banks to
become efficient. The Goverament has forced public banks on several
occasions, since 1982, to absorb the costs and obligations of restructuring
distressed sectors through extended loan maturities at unrealistic rates.
Recently, Government banks were forced to reschedule all agricultural loans
overdue more than 180 days at negative real interest rates and maturities
of up to 16 years.  The banking system was and is highly politicized and
inadequately regulated and there remains ample scope for strengthening
institutional facilities for upgrading the efficieacy and the skills of
bank management and professional staffs. The Bank is addressing these
issues through a financial sector review and a proposed Second Structural
Adjustment Loan, SAL II.
II. PROJECT OBJECTIVES AND LOAN EFFECTIVENESS
Backlround
2.01     The project was identified by the Bank in 1975-76 in discussions
with the Government, prepared by the CBCR with Bank assistance in June 1977
and appraised in February 1978. As approved by the Board in June 1978, the
project provided for the establishment in the CBCR of a permanent, finan-
cially independent industrial development fund, Fondo de Desarrollo Indus-
trial (FODEIN). This fund would operate as a second tier lending facility
that would mobilize and lend term resources to the qualified financial
intermediaries (which were till recently the four publicly owned banks).3
Loan Obiectives
2.02     The Industrial Credit project sought to:
ti) Give technical and financial support to the industrial develop-
ment program proposed in the National Plan for 1978-82 by
providing term resources and technical assistance;
(ii) Create the institutional capability to promote and finance
efficient export and import substitution subprojects and super-
vise their satisfactory execution;
21 The Costa Rican banking systems has historically been substantially
repressed. The CBCR played a major role in allocating and rationing
resources and restricting competition for deposits. The ratio of M2 -
Ml was only 42 in mid-1970's, which is about 30Z of what would be
expected given Costa Rica's relatively high level of per capita GNP.
31 Direct lending to a single financial intermediary, following the
pattern of IDB's earlier industrial lending through the Banco de Costa
Rica, was examined by the mission and rejected on the grounds that
multiple institution lending would reach a larger number of
beneficiaries and introduce an element of competition into the project.
The mission also indicated that the second-tier facility could
strengthen the technical capability of participating financial
institutions.

(iii) Support especially labor-intensive activities and industries
with comparative advantage; and
(iv) Facilitate participation of smaller enterprises believed to be
more efficient at employment creation at lower cost.
2.03     The extent to which these Loan Objectives were achieved is
analyzed in para. 2.09 and in Chapters 3 and 4.
Loan Effectiveness
2.04     Major conditions of Loan Effectiveness were that: (i) FODEIN adopt
detailed operating policies and regulations acceptable to the Bank;
(ii) provisions be made to set up a scheme to guarantee loans for smaller
enterprises for up to 30Z of the loan amount; (iii) the CBCR make a US$15
million (equivalent) capital contribution to FODEIN to be maintained there-
after in real terms; (iv) at least two participating financial inter-
mediaries (PFI) be declared eligible to participate in the project; and
(v) two consultants be contracted to develop appropriate operational
manuals and guidelines, provide on-the-job training in project appraisal
for FODEIN's staff and organize short-term training seminars for profes-
sional staff of PODEIN and PFI in project appraisal.   As a method for
increasing FODEIN's independent capital structure over the 15-year repay-
ment period of the project, the CBCR assumed the obligation to repay
interest and principal on the Loan as well as FODEIN's operating expenses.
2.05     Effectiveness was scheduled for November 1978 but was not achieved
until September 1980.4 The initial problem in advancing the project was
the slow pace of discussions witi the new Government on organizational
arrangements for FODEIN (para 2.07), solved only in September 1979 when the
bill to ratify the Bank loan was sent to the Legislative Assembly and then
into committee. Thereafter, the pace of legislative activity was slower
than expected. Part of the slow pace was due to the new Government's lack
of enthusiasm for a key feature of the project i.e., setting up FODEIN as a
second tier facility within the CBCR. Soon after Board approval of the
Loan, the new Minister of Finance (MF) raised some issues about the Project
at a CBCR Board meeting. At subsequent discussions with Bank missions it
became clear that the Government wanted to minimize CBCR's role in finan-
cial management as one necessary step in reducing the financial repression
that resulted from the CBCR's excessive control over credit allocation,
interest rates, portfolio restrictions and disincentives to increased
banking system competition and resource mobilization (para. 1.04). MF's
preference was to limit CBCR to traditional monetary functions and to
explore other alternatives for loan management.
4/ Other Effective dates set by Bank management action were 4/30/79,
11/30179, 4/1/80, 6/6/80, 7/31/80, 9/12/80. The multiple delays mainly
resulted from under-estimations of the time needed for congressional
ratification of the Loan.



- 5 -
2.06     In response to the Government's expressed concern regarding the
establishment of FODEIN within the CBCR, a Bank mission returned to Costa
Rica to examine two possible alternatives: (i) undertaking the Loan as a
single tier operation, and (ii) establishing FODEIN as an independent
agency or as an independent unit within an existing public sector bank.
Option ti) was rejected on the grounds that its adoption would restrict
Bank lending to one intermediary, thus, potentially eliminating com-
petition.5 Option (ii) was rejected because it posed a number of difficult
institutional and legal problems and legislative hurdles. There is little,
if any, evidence that the MF's proposal was seriously reviewed as a basis
for a possible opening to a dialogue on financial sector reform, including
the possible reduction of financial market repression. Nor is it clear
that this loan could have become an appropriate vehicle for this. In any
event, it was not raised as an issue. At that time, the MF's concerns were
viewed as a possible stumbling block to advancing a loan that had already
been signed. The Bank agreed to modify the composition of the Board of
Director's of FODEIN to reduce high level Government participation and, on
that basis, the Government moved the Loan to the Congress for its ultimate
ratification in August 1980. After Congressional action was taken to
ratify the Loan, the CBCR acted to establish FODEIN and to provide the
US$15 million (equivalent) as a capital contributions.
2.07     Conditions of Effectiveness were fully met and the Loan went into
operations on September 12, 1980 (para. 2.04). During negotiations, the
onlending rate to sub-borrowers as fixed at 12.5Z with agreement that
rates would be reviewed annually. As inflation rates averaged 24? in 1980,
the Bank initiated interest rate discussions in line with the Loan Agree-
ment. Pending agreement, the Bank suspended subloan approvals (commit-
ments). An acceptable interest rate of 22.75Z p.a. was proposed by CBCR in
April 1981, and agreed to by the Bank in June 1981. Interest rate policy
was reviewed and modified annually over the life of the loan and with the
exception of a brief period in 1982 Bank loans have been channeled at posi-
tive interest rates (Annex 1, Table 3). Because only 7? of the total loan
amount was committed during 1980-81, and because it was expected that high
unfulfilled demand existed for pre-export working capital financing, an
amendment to the Loan Agreement was signed in August 1982 which authorized
the use of up to US$5 million for pre-export financing.6
5/  The evaluation did not mention that the Bank does deal directly with
multiple financial institutions often for many years until they gained
adequate institutional and technical strength and maturity and could be
served by a second tier facility.
6/ Demand for pre-export financing proved to be slower than expected and
industrial borrowing accelerated; thus, as of July 1984, only US$3
million on pre-export financing had been disbursed when Loan 2274-CR
the Export Finance Project (FOPEX), became effective and became a
source of export financing.



Creating Term Lending Facilities
2.08     To participate in the credit, PFI would have tot (i) establish a
separate project unit specializing in term lending; (ii) capitalize the
unit with *equity type resourcesw and maintain a total debt to permanent
resources (equity) ratio of at least 7 to 1 within the unit; and (iii)
maintain separate books of accounts and support a separate independent
audit of the unit. On that basis, participation in the project was mainly
limited to the Banco Nacional de Costa Rica (BNCR) which used about 85Z of
the investment program's resources. The Banco de Costa Rica, which used
about 91, and CODESA which disbursed almost 72 of funds, participated only
nominally in the earlier stages of the project (para. 3.01). The PCR
mission was told that the nominal participants were not prepared to support
separate project units for a low volume project or maintain separate books
of account and capitalize these operations with 7 to 1 D/E ratios. The
conditions for PFI project participation proved to be excessive for three
of the four eligible participants given the 4.5 point spreads offered and
the high incremental costs that participation imposed. Because of the
relatively low leverage ratio and high costs of setting up a special unit
to handle few loan operations, this project was not financially attractive
for P1I (Annex 2). The intended objectives might have been achieved in a
more conventional way without sacrifice to project quality. The conditions
for participation in the project were excessively complex for reasons that
were never closely examined during project design and preparation.7
2.09     FODEIN was vested with many subproject control and supervision
responsibilities that would normally reside with the first tier banking
institutions. FODEIN was an active participant in the initial preparation
of subprojects as well as subproject reviews and often insisted that a
consultant be hired to prepare subprojects as a condition for its accep-
tance of projects for review. It inspected and held copies of all dis-
bursement documents and supporting invoices. Thus, FODEIN maintained files
that would duplicate the key records normally kept in the credit and
project files of the commercial banks. In line with project requirements,
FODEIN maintained an active supervision capability and gathered data on the
performance and loan repayment status of each subproject. Most of these
tasks are (or should be) a part of the normal routine of commercial banking
7/ In place of the conditions imposed on PFIs under this project the
following conditions are more often applied. PFI would be expected to:
(i) finance 52 to 151 of the loan, depending on country conditions.
The Costa Rica project might have provided for cofinancing of about
10.OZ of subloans (equal to an explicit DIE of 10 to 1); (ii) appoint
one official as liaison to the second tier facility and train at least
one professional to be qualified to appraise terms credits; (iii) adopt
appropriate policies and procedures regarding supervision of projects
and maintenance of contracts, vouchers and records where such did not
exist; and (iv) include in its annual independent audit an audit of the
use of Bank funds and the adequacy of procurement control and records
keeping. The Bank is usually also concerned about the financial
soundness of the PFI and could establish appropriate tests to be
administered by the Central Bank or other regulatory authorities.



operations and are not appropriate to the efficient operations of a central
bank based apex institution. There was no indication in the appraisal that
PFI controls and record keeping functions were inadequate. Had PPI's
record keeping, supervision or credit control been inadequate then TA could
have been provided for under the project to ensure that problems were
solved and that FODEIN's intervention in many aspects of normal commercial
banking activity could be reduced.
III. UTILIZATION OF LOAN RESOURCES
ParticiDatina Finan,.ial Institutions
3.01     CBCR regulations limited banking system access to external devel-
opment resources to the five public sector banks. The Banco Nacional de
Costa Rica (BNCR), the country's largest commercial bank, used 792 of the
Bank's total loan resources (US$15 million) and 851 of the investment
project component (US$12 million) (Annex 1, Table 14). Banco de Costa Rica
(BCR), the second largest commercial bank, used 142 of the total loan while
CODESA used only 5Z. The Banco Anglo-Costarricensea (BAC) used a mere 22
of total funds, all of which was for pre-export (non-project) short term
financing. By comparison, under the AID financed SSE project FODEIN
operated in a more agile and less concentrated fashion. Thus, in 1984 only
about 48Z of SSE loans were channeled by BNCR. BCR used almost 301 of
resources and the balance was channeled by the other public banks. In the
end, Loan 1599-CR turned out to be a highly concentrated, large scale
lending operation. About US$12 million of the Bank loan was used to
finance only 34 FODEIN industrial investment projects. US$3 million of the
US$5 million initially allocated were used to finance 26 mainly short term,
smaller sized, pre-export projects.8
3.02     After the Bank's loan was fully committed in late 1984, FODEIN's
project financing operations switched to the use of its own resources, its
procedures for lending were simplified and lending accelerated. During
1985-87 FODEIN approved 69 investment projects amounting to C1,577 million
(about US$25 million equivalent), compared to 34 Bank financed projects
amounting to 0509.2 million (US$12 million equivalent) during 1981 to 1985
under Loan 1599-CR. FODEIN's lending operations surged for several
reasons. First, the economic outlook improved. Second, private sector
banks were given access to CBCR's development credit lines. Third, after
the Bank project closed, FODEIN prepared and issued simplified partici-
pation guidelines that reduced the time and cost of PFI lending to medium
8/ Special procedures were established for an evaluation of the possible
national benefits to be derived from the pre-export financing of each
firm. The financing proposals for these non-investment projects were
not reviewed in detail by the Bank and special procedures were adopted
for their approval. As FODEIN has not been actively involved with pre-
export financing since the initiation of Loan 2274-CR in early 1984
(when a US$25 million Bank loan was made effective to provide for an
export financing fund through pOPEX), the mission focused on the status
of 34 investment projects. A PPAR on Loan 2274-CR whici covers initial
FODEIN export operations has been issued.



size enterprise. As a result, the cost of operating with FODEIN credit
lines were lowered and the time frame for lending was reduced. Finally,
financial margins for PFI were improved as they began to charge special
fees for preparation of projects and to receive revenues from loan- related
activities such as letter of credit operations. By the end of 1987, FODEIN
had made a total of 103 loans of which 25 loans were disbursed in 1987 by
six participating public and private banks. BNCR had only 322 of 1987
lending operations, BCR had 28Z and INTERFIN 202. This was a very
different distribution than that which had prevailed during 1982-85.
3.03     Currently, the major impediment's to FODEIN lending of its ample
resources (paras. 4.07-4.08) are: (i) CBCR's law that limits CBCR's total
lending to any financial institution to an amount equal to 502 of the PFI's
recoverable assets,9 and (ii) the CBCR's lack of foreign exchange to
finance the import requirements of investment projects in a timely fashion.
Regarding foreign exchange constraints, the Interamerican Development Bank
(IDB) is currently preparing a US$30 million industrial credit to be chan-
neled through FODEIN. Regarding the impact of CBCR's lending limits, the
private banks that have been mainly affected have been discounting (with
recourse) their FODEIN eligible industrial term credits with the larger
public banks which still have scope for increasing their CBCR financial
lending operations.
Proiect Financial Plan
3.04     The Project Financial Plan for Loan 1599-CR differs substantially
from appraisal estimates (Annex 1, Table 1). First, the Bank financed a
smaller percentage of total project costs than was contemplated (26.42 vs
30.72). Second, PFI's lending operations were more conservative than
expected. Subproject financing was made on a realistic 1 to 1 DIE basis
(FODEIN's lending policy permitted highly leveraged loan: 4 to 1 for SSE
and 2 to 1 for new larger projects). The appraisal report forecast that a
highly leveraged, 3.5 to 1, financial program would prevail. Suppliers
credits, which were not anticipated, provided 112 of total financial
requirements, further reducing FODEIN's need to provide counterpart
financing. As a result of these factors, FODEIN's estimated 312 share of
project financing was reduced to only 92 of total project cost and FODEIN
used less than 252 of the US$15 million in counterpart resources that the
CBCR had provided as a condition of effectiveness. PFI met the requirement
that they finance at least 12.52 of each subloan. Retrospectively PFI's
conservative leveraging of subproject financial plans was well considered.
Had the PFI taken advantage of the higher leveraged lending provided for
under the project, it is likely that their loan portfolios would be even
weaker than they currently are. Had the Bank and FODEIN more closely
supervised and managed the percentage of Bank financing of subprojects
during 1982-84, the Bank's share of subproject financing could have been
increased, thus accelerating disbursement of the Loan. As of December 1983
the Bank was only financing 27.3Z of total project costs; with appropriate
actions the Bank's disbursements could have doubled.

-9-
Distribution of Subloans
3.05     Total investment by industry under the project was US$45.5 million
equivalent (Annex 1, Table 2). Almost 322 of total investment (US$15.5
million equivalent) were made in the Food, Beverage and Tobacco Subsectors.
The Paper and Printing Industry invested US$12.4 million equivalent and
accounted for a surprisingly high 27.22 of total, mainly because of a very
large investment project to expand paper box production and large invest-
ments by Costa Rica's publishing industry. The distribution of lending and
total investment by Industrial Sectors was substantially different from the
national industrial value added mix that had served as a basis for the
appraisal report's projections (Annex 1, Table 2). Investments by the
industries that historically account for a high percentage of domestic
value added was lower than expected. Thus, the Food and Beverage sector
that accounted for almost 452 of industrial value added had 31.92 of
investment while Paper, Products and Printing with a low 5.22 of total
value added accounted for 27.2T of investment. The project unit did not
aggressively promote direct investment in natural resource based and other
priority enterprises that were the stated focus of development under the
National Plan. There was little focused promotion activity because (1) it
was not incorporated into FODEIN's performance goals or reflected in
FODEIN's operational or supervisory concerns and (2) FODEIN's management
was fully engaged in organizing a new enterprise and had little time or
staff to devote to intense promotional activity.
Number and Size of Subproiects and Enterprises
3.06     It was estimated, during appraisal, that 229 investment sub-
projects would be financed under the Loan and that small subprojects of
less than US$50,000 would account for 26Z of the total (Annex 1, Table 4).
Only 34 investzent subprojects were financed under the Loan and 412 of
these subprojects were larger than US$1,000,000 (equivalent). There were
no micro-enterprise subprojects (assets of less than US$25,000) and few
medium scale enterprise subprojects (Annex 1, Table 4). The average asset
size of enterprises being financed was in the US$1,000,000 range. The
outcome of the Loan, with respect to size of enterprise participating and
loan size financed, was very different than expected and the Loan objective
to facilitate SSE lending was not achieved (para. 2.02). There appear to
be three main reasons why: (1) the narrow margins on lending (para. 2.11)
did not cover costs or offer adequate incentives for SSE or medium scale
lending (para 3.08); (2) FODEIN management had not been alerted to the need
to direct project promotion toward achievement of SSE and other lending
targets and goals; and (3) the three smaller public sector banks, that
dealt with medium scale clients, did not fully participate in the project.
Employment Generated and Cost Per Job
3.07     The appraisal estimated that 4,105 jobs would be created at an
average cost per job of US$11,890 (Annex 1, Table 2). Because of the of
smaller investment projects (para. 3.08) and the higher investment than
contemplated in capital intensive re-equipment projects (para 3.06), only
983 new jobs were reported as actually created. The average cost per job



- 10 -
created was US$46,236. almost 4 times higher than the appraisal estimate.-I
The employment generation results of the loan were lower than anticipated.
Experience showed that the project was not designed to promote, facilitate
or administer SSE and medium scale lending. Lending margins proved to be
too small (Annex 2) and procedures too difficult to attract PFI toward
smaller projects. Only limited supervisory time was available and Bank
staff could not address these issues. After the Bank's loan was fully
committed in 1985, FODEIN simplified and improved lending operations,
higher margins were available and all four public commercial banks joined
the project and smaller and medium size lending accelerated.
Small Scale Enterprise Lending
3.08     Starting in 1980, the CBCR launched a small scale credit program
financed with a US$5.8 million AID grant that was followed by additional
US$5 million in grants. The program, which was implemented by an SSE
lending unit within FODEIN, was successful. Some 6,525 credits were
financed through five public sector banks from 1980 through 1986.  Average
loan size was about US$1,750 equivalent. The AID project reached a micro-
enterprise group that the Bank Loan had not planned to reach under its SSE
component. The AID program was supported by a guarantee fund with an
initial contribution of US$3 million. The fund insured up to 75Z of the
outstanding balance of qualified SSE. The development of the AID SSE
facility in 1979-80 and its subsequent operations were not reflected in
Bank supervision reports. The fact that the Bank loan was not designed to
promote SSE lending should have been apparent by 1982, but this was also
not reflected in supervision reports. An appropriate point for a full
review of project objectives and goals of Loan 1599-CR was reached in late
1981/early 1982, when the Bank and FODEIN sought to establish mechanisms to
speed-up loan disbursement and Loan 1599-CR was amended to include the
financing of up to US$5 million in pre-export working capital loans for
industry. It was envisaged that demand would be high for pre-export
financing, and problems of slow loan disbursement would be resolved. This
did not prove to be the case, disbursement of the pre-export component was
slow and in the end only 602 of the allocation was disbursed. The pre-
export fund effort appeared to divnrt supervisory attention away from the
operational and design problems affecting the FODEIN project. By 1982-83
it was clear that the limited technical assistance effort-under the Loan
would not be adequate to positively affect the public banks' term lending
activities, in support of Loan objectives (para. 4.05).
Type of Enterprise and Terms of Subloans
3.09     Consistent with the difficult economic environment that prevailed
during 1980-85, about 82Z of subprojects financed were for the expansion of
existing enterprises while only 6 loans were to support new projects
(Annex 1, Table 5). Fifteen subprojects were to finance import substitu-
tion activity, 3 projects were designed to increase export operations and
101 This cost per job created is in line with experience in other DFC loans
in Latin America that specialized in larger scale lending operations in
food processing or printing and chemicals industry and the like.



- 11 -
16 projects were to help increase both domestic and export sales.
Unfortunately most expert expansion plans were directed toward the
shrinking CACH. Forty percent of FODEIN loans were granted for terms of
from 8 to 15 years. An additional 382 of loans had 6 and 7 year maturities
(Annex 1, Table 5). The need for such extended terms was not always sup-
ported by the project cash flow analysis.
Financial and Economic Rates of Return
3.10     Financial rates of return calculated for the subprojects financed
were high in nominal terms, averaging almost 401 (Annex 1, Table 5). How-
ever, with average rates of inflation ranging around 25Z during project
implementation, real financial rates of return calculated for subprojects
do not differ widely from appraisal estimates of about 152 in real terms.
Because of the difficult economic environment, the problems encountered by
exporters to the CACM, and the large number of projects that have
encountered unforeseen problems (para. 3.13), the financial and economic
returns for at least 352 of the project are expected to be substantially
lower than estimated. Five projects have failed, five project are
operating with difficulty and may remain "evergreen projects' and three
others will operate below expectations (Table I below). While financial
and economic returns have not been prepare by FODEIN on an ex-post basis,
it is clear that with 352 of project operating at zero or negative returns,
the financial and economic returns for the project that were expected can-
not be achieved. The overall economic returns of the project for Costa
Rica could be further diminished as the carrying costs of the project had
increased by about US$6.5 million due to foreign exchange cross currency
risk adjustment losses (as of May 1988).
3.11     The technical capability of FODEIN to do financial and economic
analysis was considered to be acceptable. In line with the procedures
established under Loan 1599-CR, many subprojects were prepared by consul-
tants selected by FODEIN. These reports were then reviewed by FODEIN staff
prior to their presentation in support of an application for Bank author-
ization of a subloan. Because of the early involvement of FODEIN in the
PFI's process, subloan preparation and appraisal tended to be lengthy and
FODEIN's slow review process tended to further discourage potential indus-
trial users. In line with the requirements of the Loan, after an appraised
subproject (supported by a consultant study) was presented by the PFI to
FODEIN, the Apex institution prepared a formal appraisal report on the
subloan application. This process tended to add an additional month or
more to the internal approval process. Under the Loan Agreement, FODEIN
was to play an excessively large role in the process of subproject prepara-
tion and appraisal.  This was in part due to the fact that FODEIN's staff
was better prepared by the technical assistance program to undertake Bank
style appraisal reports than were PFI's staffs, as the TA program was
directed mainly at FODEIN.
Current Status of Investment Prolects
3.12     Many of the projects financed under Loan 1599-CR were launched as
Costa Rica's economy slid into a broad recessionary trough that was
deepened by hyper-inflation and devaluation of the currency (paras.
1.02-1.03). Externalities like reduced prices and demand for coffee, cocoa
and other major export co-modities seriously affected the viability of



- 12 -
projects that depended upon exports of processed coffee, cocoa or textiles.
These developments also depressed national income, affecting domestic
consumption and consumer sales and the profitability of a number of
subprojects. As shown in Table I below, five of the 34 investments
projects financed under the loan (representing 152 of the projects financed
and 6.3Z of the loan funds) did not achieve adequate operating levels and
have closed or are in judicial collection. Five firms representing 152 of
loan funds are operating with difficulty and two are operating below
expectations. Some of these problem loans are currently being repaid to
PFI from the proceeds of sales of plant and equipment of the company or by
the parent company. Jn economic terms, however, about 352 of the Bank Loan
amount may have been lost or put at risk.

Status of Loan Portfolio
3.13     As of December 31, 1987 ten subprojects representing 20Z of loan
funds had been fully repaid; sixteen subprojects representing 522 of loan
funds have made payments on due date or were under 2 months in arrears;
five larger projects representing almost 222 of funds were in arrears under
180 days and considered by the PFI as good credit risks that were operating
in a financially constrained environment. Three subprojects were more
deeply in arrears and six are in Judicial Action. Together these represent
6.32 of loan funds (Annex 1, Table 7). The PFI optimistically expected
that they would not take financial losses on these projects. Until
recently, FODEIN financed subprojects had performed in a much better
fashion.  As of March 1986, only 82 of all subprojects financed by FODEIN
(of which Loan 1599-CR accounted for about 50) were in arrears over 91
days. By September 1987 about 23Z of total loan portfolio was reported by
PFI to be in arrears. This major deterioration in portfolio quality
reflected: (1) very tight bank credit ceilings imposed by the CBCR in mid-
1986 and continued under agreements with the IMF; and (2) sharply rising
short-term interest- rates that are currently 312 higher than the rates
prevailing in FODEIN's loan portfolio. Poor loan portfolio performance in
late 1987 may thus reflect credit restraints and interest rate disequi-
libria which reduces incentives to repay cheaper debt, and not a sudden
massive deterioration in portfolio quality.
3.14     The status and condition of each subprojects was reviewed with PFI
officials and FODEIN.   In addition, a detailed review was made of the
project documents of 10 firms that had failed or are operating with diffi-
culty. These reviews were supported by field visits to 5 project sites
where management was interviewed and conditions of operations observed.
This research effort revealed that, while the recession played an important
role in reducing project profitability, it turned out not to be the major
cause of project failure.  The major controllable internal reasons why
subprojects did not perform as expected were few in number:
(a) Inadequate Marketing and Distribution Research. About 502 of problem
subprojects suffered from an inadequate understanding of the markets in
which they had hoped to compete.  Many of these new investment sub-
projects were based on only a limited knowledge of product require-
ments, especially for foreign markets, where product quality, style,
size and pricing realities were not well understood. Few if any of the
subprojects invested in systematic marketing or distribution research
or tested products and market concepts and programs and iientified
problems. None of the PFI insisted that such research be undertaken.
FODEIN did not employ marketing experts.
(b) Inadeguate Evaluation of Management Capability to Operate Comples
Proiect. In about 252 of the problem cases, the entrepreneur or the
management team was unable to plan for and successfully execute a
project start-up or efficiently run an expanded enterprise after the
projects became operational. Loan appraisals totally lacked a serious
evaluation of management's capability to effectively operate new or
expansion projects financed under the Loan.



- 14 -
3.15     The major external events affecting the project outcome includeds
(a) the continued deterioration of the CACM and the sharp reduction of
Costa Rican exports to this market; (b) continued inflation and devaluation
and the rising costs of debt service and imports; and (c) reduced private
construction and public works activity. About one-half of the projects
financed under the Loan depended upon increased export sales to the CACM,
which was a declining market that had been under growing financial and
political stress since 1980. The failure of CACM export oriented invest-
ments to produce satisfactory export sales and revenues was the key factor
affecting subproject financial performance. The failure of FODEIN and/or
the Bank to flag the higb risks involved in excessive dependance on a
failing CACM represents a breakdown in the project appraisal review
process.
3.16     Based upon a review of subproject files, it is not clear that the
Bank subproject review processes contributed substantially toward iden-
tifying problem subprojects, raising key issues regarding the adequacy of
the technical assistance to PPI and FODEIN, or the needs for additional
assistance to further improve subproject appraisal or preparation (para.
4.02-4.04). The Bank subproject review process appeared to be pro-forma,
in line with the original intent of the project; i.e., to reduce the Bank's
involvement in the labor intensive si.bproject review process.11 The Bank
received 17 "Al subprojects (projects exceeding the US$250,000 free limit)
for its review. Of these subprojects, 10 are currently operating with
difficulty or have failed. None of these subprojects were identified by
the Bank review as potential problems,12 nor did the subproject reviews
lead to any judgements about the overall appraisal capability of PFI or
FODEIN or the need for further training of Loan participants. Such
findings raise questions about the meaning and/or the adequacy of the
Bank's subproject review process as it could have counterproductive
aspects. Inexperienced PFI may excessively depend upon the Bank's review
and approval of subprojects, without having an adequate understanding of
the amount of time, or the professional skills mix that was actually
devoted to the review task. They may not know that these may vary
substantially depending on Bank staff experience and availability. It is
also possible that the high focus on the review of the financial and
economic rates of return methodology may send the wrong signals to PFI
about other central issues of the subproject preparation and review
processes (e.g. development of a strong marketing plan and test of the
plan, assurances that adequate management is in place).
3.17     In approving a subproject for disbursement which has gone through
the A subproject review process, the Bank implicitly places its imprimatur
on the subproject and, in the absence of specific comments to the contrary,
seems to confirm the general quality of appraisal work presented by the
I1/ Recent experience has shown that up to three man days of Bank staff
time can be required to carefully review an A subproject.
12/ There is, as an example, no record of any Bank's suggestions that
borrowers invest in market research to validate key assumptions
regarding market acceptance of new products and foreign or domestic
sales projections.



- 15 -
PFI. In that context, the Bank places itself in the position of author-
izing for disbursement a subproject that may not have been technically well
prepared. Consideration should be given to the option that the Bank's *no
objection, telex designating approval to withdraw be sent to the PFI with a
clear statement that sets out the linitations (if any) of the Bank review
process to reduce the possibility that the PFI does excessively rely upon
the Bank to flag potential problems or significantly reduce project risks.
This procedure could (i) assist Bank managers to carefully assess staffing
and time allocation priorities, as they relate to the subproject review and
the linked institutional building efforts, and (ii) place PFIs on notice
that the Bank's review is limited to selected areas and offers no implicit
conment on the adequacy of others.
IV. INSTITUTIOL4AL DEVELOPMENT
Institution Building
4.01     The institutional development objective of Loan 1599-CR was 'to
assist Costa Rica in building up an institutional set-up for financing
efficient subprojects.' The appraisal report dealt at length with the
development of an apex institution, but discussed only briefly the needs of
the PFI to Improve overal. term lending capability. The specific institu-
tional building tasks needed to help ethieve the above objectives would
includes
(A) Establishing FODEIN with the technical capability to: (i)
review subprojects presented to it by PFI; (ii) identify areas
of strengths and weaknesses in subproject preparation and
appraisal; and (iii) help PFI to improve their appraisal and
credit supervision skills.
(B) Assisting PFI to develop: (i) effective lending policies that
would include expanded mediti and long term project lending;
(ii) appropriate procedures for project promotion to ensure an
expanding supply of efficient subprojects for funding; and
(iii) professionally adequate subproject preparation and
appraisal facilities, sound credit management and appropriate
policies and procedures for project supervision.
Technical Assistance
4.02     The above stated broad institution building objectives proved to
be an overly ambitious undertaking given: (i) the public banking sector
environment and its relatively low state of development; (ii) the rela-
tively short time frame involved in this initial operatj.ons; and finally
(iii) the small amount of funds allocated for technical assistance (TA) and
the modest scope of the TA program when compared with the broad range of
needs for assistance that the PFI would have (para 4.03). In reality the
project narrowly focussed its institution building efforts on improving
FODEIN's appraisal skills and on the development of its procedures and
methods manaals. This effort was supported by US$120,000 in loan funds
(para. 4.04).



- 16 -
4.03     During loan preparation, it would be expected that the l3ank
achieve an understanding ofs (i) the availability of financial sector
training facilities (e.S. banking association operated training facili-
ties); (ii) the skills mix and level of sophistication of tra!ning
facilities at local universities or other centers; and (iii) the measures
that would need to be taken, in the short term, to prepare existing PFI
staff to better handle subproject appraisals and in the longer term to
upgrade professionalism and the quality of banking operations. During
appraisal, the Bank would normally assess the financial and technical capa-
bility of the major prospective PFIs and visit the other smaller operations
to discuss their capability and needs for assistance. On that basis, an
appropriate short and medium term training/institutional building program
could be designed. Under Loan 1599-CR, these measures were ne%t fully taken
as it was expected that FODEIN would take the initiative to help define
sector training and institutional development needs and upgrade PFI profes-
sional capability. Given FODEIN's inexperience, staff limitations and
funding constraints, this did not happen. There was little, if any, time
spent on follow-up on these institutional and technical assistance issues
during supervision.
4.04     In line with the Loan Agreement, almost US$120,000 was borrowed by
the CBCR to finance a training program in subproject appraisal and super-
vision and for the preparation of a subproject appraisal manual and rele-
vant procedures for operating the facility. Two contractors initiated the
program in late 1980. During 1981-82, they trained mainly FODEIN staff in
subproject appraisal. No institutional memory of this training effort
exists among the PFI. As a result of the training program's focus of tech-
nical ass: nce on the apex institution, the less well prepared PFI
depended upon FODEIN to review and reappraise many of the subprojects
presented to it for financing, which was costly to the CBCR.13 PFI con-
tinued to depend upon FODSIN's staff intervention to help them to advance
subproject appraisal and conduct supervision during the life of the Loan.
4.05     Retrospectively, in the project design, provisions for the
training of PFI were clearly inadequate. What made matters worse was that
subsequent Loan supervision did not deal with this problem and the need for
a mid-term correction in the project's institution building efforts. Had
PFI appraisal and supervision capability been brought to acceptable levels,
then FODEIN might have processed loan applications and supervised overall
program activity with fewer full time professionals, thus reducing project
cost. In November 1987, the Interamerican Development Bank (IDB) initiated
preparation of an industrial sector credit, amounting to US$30 million
equivalent using the FODEIN facility. It is likely that the IDB, in
cooperation with AID, will then concentrate technical assistance resources
on building the professional capabilities of PFI, and FODEIN could reduce
its participation in the project preparation process and in the appraisal
function. It is expected to increase project promotion and relevant super-
vision functions.
131 In line with Project requirements, FODEIN prepared its own complete
appraisal report for each of the 34 subprojects, a feat that consumed
about 90 man weeks of staff time.



- 17 -
4.06     FODEIN is currently soundly organized, well managed and supported
by an effective staff of five professionals which may be appropriate for
its current higher volume of lending. FODEIN performed its heavy burden of
assigned tasks with acceptable efficiency. The heavy iandate for this apex
in-stitution, in line with approved Policy and Procedu,es Statements, was to
serve as a financial agent with loan review/approval responsibilities.
FODEIN was responsible for procurement review and the maintenance of pro-
curement and expenditure records. FODEIN also followed up on and super-
vised all outstanding accounts and received current information on the
status of repayment of each subproject. In fact, FODEIN was given first
tier level operational responsibility to deal directly with commercial bank
clients to help them, as an example, to engage consulting services for
purposes of preparing subprojects. In line with Bank requirements, FODEIN
also directly reviewed procurement decisions with the borrower and the PFI
and received copies of receipts and other procurement documents which it
checked against lists of goods prepared for each subproject.
4.07     Many of the responsibilities assigned to FODEIN under Loan 1599-CR
would normally be expected to be part of the operating responsibilities of
a qualified financial intermediary. FODEIN's efforts did indeed duplicate
PFI's normal procurement review and record keeping activities. In that
regard, there existed, during Loan preparation, an incomplete understanding
of standard commercial banking operations and the securities and checks
that au adequately efficient financial institution would normally have in
place. Very little weight was given to the role that the PFI's external
auditors could play in assuring the Bank that a PFI had adequate policy and
procedures in place to control disbursements and procurements and to main-
tain mportant documents. Thus, an excessive number of tasks were assigned
to FODEIN, as a direct result of which FODEIN operated more slowly than
necessary, requiring between 3 to 6 months to complete a subproject re-
view/approval cycle. Shifting responsibility from PPI to FODEIN did have
the effect of reducing Bank project supervision activity as only 15 man
days of supervision time were reported in the period from 1982 through 1986
(Page iii). A high percentage of Bank supervision dealt with the need to
raise the level of project supervision efforts.
Financial Sectoz Policy Development
4.08     Interest rate policy related issues became the focus of staff
concern during project appraisal. Costa Rica's administratively estab-
lished fixed interest rate policy was inconsistent with efficient term
lending operations. At negotiations, it was agreed that the adequacy of
subloan interest rates (initially set at 12.52) would be reviewed annually.
In September 1980, as the Loan became effective, inflation had risen to
almost 242 p.a. and interest rates had became highly negative. As this was
not acceptable, the Bank suspended operations (informally) pending an
agreement on interest rates. By mid 1981, agreement was reached on a final
lending interest rate of almost 23Z. Interest rates have remained positive
since then (Annex 1, Table 3). The initial interest rate discussions did
lead to broader agreements by the Government on interest rate policy. It
is reasonable to say that a positive result of 'oan 1599-CR was that it



- 18 -
pioneered progress and helped to change interest rate policy in Costa Rica.
However, it is also reasonable to speculate that, as pointed out before and
in para. 4.09, the Bank's supervisory commitment may have been inadequate
over the life of the project to influence other aspects of financial sector
activity that might have benefited from greater project involvement.
4.09     Reducing Bank involvement with PFI by using an apex facility was
an important, implicit, objective of the project. The appraisal did not
directly address the trade-offs or the costs that could be involved in the
proposed sharp reduction in the Bank's work with financial intermediaries
and banking supervisory and monetary authorities. Under Loan 1599-CR, the
Bank's direct involvement with the financial sector proved to be episodic
rather than continuous and the Bank failed to build a strong sectoral data
base and detailed expertise on the financial sector and the condition and
problems of key financial institutions (e.g. there is no evidence that
issues of accounting policy or banking supervisory practice were ad-
dressed). The ongoing project did not serve as a vehicle for building a
basis for a policy dialogue that has frequently been woven through ID?
operations.14 A possible cost of initial excessive reliance upon an apex
institution to substantially reduce Bsank staff involvement in IDF lending
operations was that professional staff's direct involvement with financial
sector issues was limited over the life of the project and prospects for an
ongoing dialogue on sectoral issues were reduced.
PODI'. FiPnancial Position
4.10     PODEIN was established as a permanent institution with an initial
capital structure consisting of the proceeds of the US$15 million Bank Loan
and US$15 million (equivalent) that the CBCR provided as counterpart
resources.  The Loan Agreement also provided that the CBCR would: (i) main-
tain counterpart funds in real terms; (ii) meet all the direct and indirect
costs of FODEIN operations; and (iii) would repay the interest, principal
and comuitment fee under the loan. Thus, all interest payments by inter-
mediaries have served to increased FODIZN's permanent resources while its
high initial capital base and adequate reflows from loans to PFI provide
for ample local currency liquidity to meet: current and projected future
14/ There are successful models of how the Bank's DFI lending operations
managed to handle the mixture of project and financial sector issues to
advance: (i) major financial policy goals; (ii) capital market
reformation; and (iii) improvements in bank regulatory and supervisory
practice. The need for financial sector reform activity was recognized
in Costa Rica but never integrated into the project's reduced
supervision processes during 1983-1985. Such .discussions were being
conducted in several LAC countries in the context of existing or future
DFC projects. The use of an Apex facility reduces Bank staff
supervision effort. The trade-offs in the form of reduced Bank staff
involvement in the details of financial sector operations and reduced
prospects for devel` 4- the expertise and creditability to influence
macro-p 'icy or PFI performance was not addressed in the a,praisal
report's "project risksf section.



- 19 -
operations. As of December 31, 1986, FODEIN had assets equal to US$30.3
million and no liabilities. (Annex 1, Table 11 shows the growth of FODEIN
asset structure during 1981-1987).
4.11     As the CBCR provided FODEIN with US$15 million equivalent in
capital and paid for its costs of operations, Loan 1599-CR clearly suc-
ceeded in its objective of establishing FODEIN on a solid financial
footing. Based upon its highly liquid position amounting to US$10 million
in cash on deposit in the CBCR, its recent annual operating profits equal
to about US$1.5 million (Annex 1, Table 12) and its annual reflows of about
US$2.5 million, FODEIN is firmly positioned to meet the term lending needs
of the industrial sector in the foreseeable future. (See Annex 1, Table 13
for favorable financial ratios). Thus, further lending to Costa Rica to
support industrial sector investment would, inter alia, be based upon
reducing the Government's shortage of foreign exchange resources to
expedite imports for investment projects financed by FODBIN. The DEB's
prospective US$30 million industrial sector loan is expected to provide the
CBCR with the foreign exchange needed to support the imports of equipment
and services by the industrial investment projects financed through FODEIN.
Auditla and Financial Reporting
4.12     The appraisal report for Loan 1599-CR did not include an analysis
of the auditing and financial reporting requirements of the project and the
special accounting problems that could result from the method used to
ensure thats (i) FODEIN's counterpart funds would be maintained in real
terms; and (ii) its operating costs would be fully covered by the Central
Bank. The Loan Agreement provided that an annual independent audit of
FODF- would be conducted by the CBCRI'S Auditor General (AGB). The absence
of a clear cut definition of requirements has not proven to be satisfactory
as unresolved accounting presentation problems continued to be vexing
through the life of the project. As of February 1985, problems associated
with the form and content of the audit for the year ending December 31,
1982 had still not been resolved. The audit for 1986 was reviewed by the
PCR mission. This audit report successfully dealt with some of the Bank's
prior objections regarding context and presentation and it did provide
additional information and comparative financial data for prior years. The
audit report also provided estimates of what FODEIN'S direct and indirect
operating costs would have been had CBCR not absorbed the total costs of
FODEIN operations.
4.13     The 1986 audit report represented a substantial improvement over
prior efforts. However, balance sheet errors in adjustment accounts for
1985 were carried forward to 1986 and are currently being reviewed by the
AGB. Thus, a final n.adit report for the project was not available to the
PCR mission. Nevertheless, FODEIN'S loan portfolio and cash accounts have
been audited in detail and the outstanding balance on each loan confirmed
in line with the comments made by the Bank in its February 1985 review of
FODEIN's 1982 audit report.

V. SUMMARY AND CONCLUSIONS
Proiect Obiectives
5.01     The four major objectives of the project were only partially
achieved:
1.  The Loan succeeded in creating FODEIN as an organizationally
and financially strong and well managed apex facility within
the CBCR. Since the closing of the Bank Loan, FODEIN has been
reorganized and it adopted new procedures which have increased
its efficiency, reduced lending delays, returned respon-
sibility for Loan preparation and appraisal to the PFI and
sharply expanded the number of public banks participating in
the program. Private banks were permitted to participate,
starting in 1987.
2.  The Loan provided only very limited amounts of lending to the
larger SSE that the Loan had hoped to target through the
establishment of a guarantee facility. At the same time the
AID-sponsored micro-enterprise program through FODEIN granted
5,525 loans to micro-enterprises that were made by the public
commercial banks, at subsidized interest rates.
3.  Reflecting the project's limited success in promoting and
attracting smaller and medium scale borrowers, the Loan failed
to finance employment generation at low cost. Less than 25Z
of the jobs estimated were actually created and the average
cost per job was a high US$46,236, four times higher than
expected.
4.  The Loan attracted less than the expected volume of natural
resource intensive investment and it did nothing to advance
diversification of PFI borrowers.15 However, it led to a much
higher than anticipated level of resource mobilization by
investment enterprises and suppliers.
5.02     Loan 1599-CR did not fully achieve its lending objectives as
aspects of the design of the project proved to be inappropriate and super-
vision was constrained and inadequate to provide corrective measures:
a) financial incentives were thin as the maximum permitted finan-
cial spreads of initially 32 and then 4.52 were inadequate to:
(a) compensate PFIs for the costs of establishing and
operating a special term lending unit and assuming the risks
of lending to smaller and medium enterprise; and (b) provide
15/ In its comments on the PCR the CBCR noted that industrial development
policy highly favored import substitution. See Annex 3, Page 1 for
full text of comment.



- 21 -
PFIs with a real return on their capital given the required,
restrictive 7 to 1 DI ) leverage ratio (see Annex 2 for tech-
nical discussion).1
b) the policies and procedures created for the apez institution
were incompatible with efficient outward-reaching operations.
FODEIN's procedures resulted in lengthy and costly loan
processing, slow disbursement and low project participation.
FODEIN was not fully aware of the Bank's project objectives.
thus, they were not embodied in its organizational and opera-
tional arrangements which did not provide for activities or
incentives to steer the project toward achieving the objec-
tives set by the Bank.
c) the conditions for participation of financial intermediaries
in the project proved to be unnecessarily stringent and
restrictive. Simpler and more realistic conditions could have
been applied and broader participation sougs&. As a result,
the project became virtually a one institution loan as BNCR
used 802 of total loan funds to finance large size loans and
85Z of investment project resources.  The other public insti-
tutions backed away from the conditions imposed.
d) technical assistance efforts were limited given the rather
broad objective of the project, i.e. to create institutional
capability within a new ape-tunit and technically inadequate
PFI. In the end, TA efforts were focused on FODEIN, which did
not have the staff available to perform the task of helping
PFI to improve project appraisal and term portfolio manage-
ment. The project set excessively ambitious institutional
targets for the financial and Bank staff resources applied.
e) periodic reviews of the adequacy of policy, procedure or
product pricing were not made. There was little if any mana-
gerial or Bank response to the data that indicated that the
project was not achieving its lending objective with respect
to employment generation, loan size, cost per job created and
finally quality of loan portfolio. Since project promotion
and marketing functions were not included in FODEIN's opera-
tions, corrective actions were not taken during the life of
the project.
16/ The CBCR commented, in support of the low financial spreads provided
under the loan, that spreads were adequate because the operating costs
of financial intermediaries were only increased marginally (see Annex
3). Staff does not agree for reasons cited in Annex 2. It is unsound
banking practice to price a new banking product line at marginal cost.
For a financial product line to be sustainable within a bank it must
bear its fair share of direct, indirect and overhead costs plus
provisions and earn a real return on capital in line with the
opportunity costs of funds. On that basis it ie sound practice to
price any financial product at average cost, in the absence of a cost
accounting system.

5.03     It is not clear why problems in project design were not addressed
in 1982-83 by expanded supervision as it became evident that the project
outcome would be very different from that expected. Solutions to slow
disbursement were sought by modifying the loan to finance pre-export
requirements. But the basic problems of low spreads and cumbersome pro-
cedu.es that restricted participation were never addressed and reviewed
until FODEIN unilaterally altered and streamlined operations - after Bank
funds were committed and the project closed.
Economic and Financial Results
5.04     About one quarter of the subprojects financed are operating with
difficulty and 62 have failed. The financial rates of return and the eco-
nomic results will be less than expected and delayed. Part of the reason
for the somewhat high subproject distress rate results from the fact that
during project implementation the Costa Rican economy was staggering
through a five-year recession including hyper-inflation, major exchange
rate adjustments and the unraveling of the CACM, a major market for many
industries. Another important reason for high subproject failure was the
evident lack of skill in addressing the market and distribution analysis
aspects of subproject preparation, especially in export related project. A
large number of these subprojects were over the free limit and, thus,
subject to prospective detailed review by the Bank prior to its approval
and authorization to withdraw from the Loan Account. The Bank's review
process did not identify or flag the lack of adequate marketing analysis in
the failed subprojects.
5.05     It is not clear that the Bank can make a meaningful contribution
to the evaluation of the adequacy or inadequacy of subproject appraisal
methodology without a higher 1 vel of involvement in the process. This
would imply, especially for first projects like Loan 1599-CR, that the Bank
would give more weight to a process designed to prevent economic loss
(failed subprojects) than it does to other aspects of Bank operations. It
would imply (i) the use of qualified experts experienced, as an example, in
areas of marketing and distribution and (ii) the provision of technical
assistance over a longer period of time, including not only pre-operatioaal
training programs but also programs that were designed to address the
problems identified during project operations. This Loan provided for
early training but nothing to correct the actual problems that emerged
during the life of the project.

Financial Svreads, Leverage Ratios and Profitability
1.       Under Loan 1599-CR, Participating Financial Intermediaries (PPIle)
were initially granted a maximum financial spread of 3 percentage points on
all subloans except those to SSE, which were priced to carry a 4 percentage
point spread. lI When interest rates were increased in mid-1981. financial
spreads for PPIle were increased to a flat 4.5 percentage points for all
subloans. The appraisal report did not present a rationale for setting the
initial 3 or the subsequent 4.5 percentage point limits on financial
spreads. Moreover, this document did not present normative data for Costa
Rican comercial banks, nor demonstrate that the maximum allowable
financial spreads would be adequate to cover operating expenses and
provisions for bad debt while yielding reasonable real returns to PFIs.
Since PPIs were required to maintain high capital to asset ratios of 12.5S
(equivalent to the 7 to 1 DIE ratio specified in the Loan Agreement) as a
condition for their participation in the Bank Loan. it is clear that
exceptionally high returns on assets would be required for PFIs to earn
reasonable real returns on capital (para. 2 (a)). How high returns on
assets would be gained was not discussed.
2.       An analysis of the adequacy of net financial spreads (4.5 percent
on assets) provided for in Loan 1599-Cr would revealed the following about
thq costs of banking and margin requirements:
(A) Return on Capital: Of the 4.5 percent of spread granted under
the Loan, 2.0 percentage points, or 44.4Z of the total, would
have been required to provide a PFI, operating under the
prescribed 12.5Z capital/asset ratio, with a nominal pre-tax
return of 16Z on capital (equal to an estimated 10? after tax
return). Since high returns such as 2 percent on assets are
only rarely earned by commercial banks, there appeared to be
strong indications that the spread and the leverage structure
would not be compatible.
(B) Cost of Operations An estimated 4.0 to 4.8 points were
required to cover the operating costs of the coamercial banks
in Costa Rica. This compares reasonably well with the 3.5 to
4.7 (4.2 average) percentage points required to cover the
operating costs of the larger, more developed, commercial
banks in Colombia, Mexico and Venezuela, during 1981-84. The
more efficient, larger size, PDIC-insured commercial banks in
the U.S. (during 1981-84) required, on average, a low 2.6
points on assets to cover their operating costs.

This is not the same as the difference between the interest rate
charged borrowers and the interest rate paid or borrowed funds.

(C) Provisions for Bad Debts: 0.6 of one percentage point on
assets would be required annually to cover the costs of
making provisions for possible loan and interest losses for a
relatively efficient short term lending institution operating
under moderately uncertain business conditions. In Costa
Rica about 1.0 point would be required, given the higher loan
failure rates associated with term lending operations in the
uncertain economic environment-that characterize the project.
NORMATIVE DATA: Actual Spread (Return on Asset) Requirements for
the Loan
3.       A highly efficient U.S. commercial bank operating under the
leverage conditions specified by Loan 1599-CR would have required 5.2
percentage points of spread to earn a nominal pre-tax profit of 16Z.
(Under spread leverage conditions provided for in the Loan, an efficient
U.S. commercial bank would have earned an inadequate 102, pre-tax, return
on capital). Since, the financial spread and the leverage conditions
permitted under the Loan would have been inadequate even for a highly
efficient commercial bank, it is clear that less efficient Costa Rican
banks would fair even less well.
4.       Commercial banks in more advanced Latin American countries
(Colombia, Mexico and Venezuela) would have operating costs of about 4.2
percentage points and would have experienced a small positive gross
operating income under the Loan. After modest provisions of 0.6, however,
these banks would show a loss of 0.3Z on assets which would result in a
loss of 2.42 on capital applied to the project. The 4.5 points of spread
and very conservative leverage conditions of the Loan would have resulted
in financial losses for the commercial banks in the three countries. These
commercial banks would, on average, have required 6.8 percentage points of
spread to meet a pre-tax earnings target of 162 on capital, under the
leverage conditions prescribed.
5.       Costa Rican PFIs At the time of the loan an average commercial
bank in Costa Rica would probably not have covered its costs of operations
with 4.5 percentage points of spread, and the requirements to make
provisions for bad debts with a nominal 16? pre-tax profit under Loan
1599-CR's low leverage structure would have required about 7.1 points of
spread. Not very different from the 6.8 point margin requirement of the
more advanced Latin American commercial banks illustrated above.
6.       Returns on assets for commercial banks operating in relatively
efficient environments are low (about 1.2 percent on assets in Colombia and
Venezuela, 1.2 percent in the U.S. and 1.6 in Mexico). An efficient U.S.
regional commercial bank in a competitive environment will require about
4.2 points of financial spread for it to earn about 1.1 percent (net) on
assets. This would yield the Bank about 15.72 on capital, based upov a
capital to asset ratio of 7.0 percent (equal to a 13.3 to 1 DIE).
7.       The 7 to 1 D/E leverage ratio specified under the Loan was
inconsistent with low cost (margin) banking operations. An efficient PFI



- 39 -                 Annex 2
Page 3 of 3
could have achieved a nominal pre-tax profit of about 152, on capital
applied to the Bank loan, with about 6.0 points of spread if the leverage
ratio (DIE) permitted under the loan were 14 to 1. The Bank loan provided
for double this capital requirement and 75Z of the spread needed.
SUMMARY
8.       Inadequate attention was given to key financial aspects of project
design. Normative data on banking income, costs and financial structure
were not used to help establish financial targets and the mathematical
relationship between leverage and spread was not examined. Thus, both
relatively low spreads and very low leverage were assigned to PPI. Ther.e
proved to be incompatible with a reasonably efficient P1I earning net
profits or reasonable returns on capital. Clearly greater attention needs
to be given to understanding the cost structure of PF1, and where
appropriate, letting interest rates and spreads be set by the market
conditions prevailing and in line with each PFI's perception of its own
cost structure and profit requirements.
CONCLUSION
9.       Appraisal reports decisions regarding margin structures, capital
requirements, leverage ratio requirements, etc. should, where possible, be
supported by an analysis that takes into account the operational data for
the institutions involved and the leverage conditions under which local
institutions operate. On the basis of such information, a simple financial
analysis should be prepared that demonstrates the logic and consistency of
the conditions for lending and capital adequacy requirements for the
institution as well as the possible financial returns to the intermediaries
that participate in Bank projects.

Tra uletioa of CBCR Coments on PCR
Mr. Alexander Nowicti, Division Chief
The World lank
I ack*elvdge receipt of your letter of March 1, 1989 with the
enclosed Project Completion Report on Industrial Credit Project 1599-CR.
We would like to mke the followin commets on this report:
1.        In piragraph 5.01(0) of the PCR it is stated that lan  1599-CR was
used to a less r degree than expected for financing investmt projects making
Intensive use of local natural resources.
It should be noted In this connection that iAdustrial development
during the period covered concentrated on import substitution, since the
highly protected local and Central American market made sucb an approach very
profitable. In addition, considerable Incentives were given for the purchase
of machinery and equipment and the iWprtation of raw materials. The
structure of FODEIN's portfolio was therefore determined by the d emad from
national Industry.
This situation wa difficult to reverse by mean of the credit
mechanism alone, but the structural changes that will be brought about by the
measures relating to the level of protection for industry, interest rates,
exchange rates, Internal organization of enterprises, etc., with a view to
incrasing the country's exports to m_rkets otber than the local and regional
ones will make the comparative advntages of producing with a greater
national added value more evident in the future.
2.        Th  fincial operating _agin allowed to the partipatin
intermelares (HIs) Is sot ncecssarly smll, s Is asserted in paragraph
5.02(a). since while It Is tru  that the rles specified that to participate

Finally, an agreement was reached under which the PFIs would
maintain separate accounts for their operations with FODEIN resources, but
within their established accounting systems. As a result, virtually no costs
were Incurred for additional auditing.
Furthermore, over a year ago, following a review of the regulations
governing FODEIN, the PFIs were authorized to place the part of subloans
financed with their own resources at different terms and interest rates than
those applied to the FODEIN resources. The Interest earned on the funds
contributed by the private banks is therefore higher than that obtained from
the PODEIN funds, while the term is much shorter.
3.        Paragraph 5.02(c) states that the conditions required for PFI
participation in the program meant that, with the exception of the Banco
Nacional de Costa Rica (BNCR), the other public Institutions did not
participate fully in it.  We would like to coent on this statement as
follows:
(a) The Corporaci6n Costarricense de Desarrollo (CODESA) ceased to be a
program PFI for purely legal reasons.
(b) Of the other four Institutions, two virtually did not participate in
the program. However, this situation prevailed both during the period covered
by the PCR and after 1984, when a number of measures were taken that
simplified and streamlined FODEIN's operations. At the present time the
participation of the two state banks in question is practically nil despite
the fact that the cost of operating with FODEIN funds bas been reduced, as
noted In paragraph 3.02 of the PCR.
(c) Once Costa Rican legislation allowed the private banks access to
Central Bank resources obtained from external sources, their participation in
FODEIN increased appreciably.
For these reasons we do not believe that It was necessarily the
conditions imposed on the PFIs for participation In the program which caused
two of them not to play any significant role in channeling FODEIN resources.
4.        Regarding the need to increase the fliancial margin allowed the PFIs
and the gearing ratio, we would co.ment as follows:
(a) For the reasons set forth in section 2 of this telex we consider
that a mre detailed anlyso  is weeded to determine whethir any Increase in
the financal margin granted to the PFI. Is called for. ik principle. it is
felt that if th   margin were inadequate the private baukg would not be using
IODEIN's resources to the extent they are at present.
(b)  Increasing the gearAng ratio In ODEIN would have the following
negative effects:
(1)   fte coeoercial bank would reach the ceiling set for indebtedness to
the tentral Dank (DCCH) quicker, since reduction of their
contribution could also lower this ceiling, whch might slow down
the disbursement of PODEIN rsources.

(it)    The significant lncrease in the number of banks, together with
negative developments in a lrge number of flinacial entities, have
caused JCCR to be more cautious in granting loans. At WCCRl
request, the Legislative Assembly recently approved a law that will
regulate the uational financial system mor effectively than baa
been the case so far. Incresing the gearlg ratio In FODEIN will
therefore bring about an lacrase ln the level of the comercial
banks' Indebtedness ti conjunction with a smller contribution on
their part, which would heighten the risk for JCCR
