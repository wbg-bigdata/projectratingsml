TRADE AND FINANCIAL SECTOR ADJUSTMENT OPERATION
LOAN SUMMARY
Uowrower:                          Jamaica
Amount:                            US$40.0 million.
Payable io 17 years, includlng a grace period
of 4 years at the standard variable Interest
rate.
LVA   D.ecription:                 The proposed loan would be in support of the
Government's program of structural adjustment;
it would include programs to further enhance
actions taken under the first tiree SALs. The
proposed sector operation aims at improving
the performance of exports and industry as
w1e as strengthening the financial sector.
More particularly the program will focus on
the following problem areas: (i) elimliating
the remaining distortions in the trade regime
with a view to establishing a broad based and
more uniform tariff structure with appropriate
incentives for exports; and (ii) reducing the
bias against private luvestment and equity
investments by eliminating distortions in
financial markets. The loan would finance
Imports of raw materials, intermediate goods,
non-luxury consumer goods, capital equipment
and spare parts. Counterpart funds would be
used to reduce the indebtedness of the
Government with the domestic banking system.
isburement Estimate:               The loan would be disbursed In two tranches.
It is anticipated that the first tranche of
US$20 million would be- disbursed soon after
loan effectiveness. The second tranche of
US$20 milllon would be released subject to a
review of the adjustment program to be held
within nine months from loan effectiveness.
Disbursement of the entire loan is expected to
be completed within twelve months of loan
effectiveness.



(ii)
Risks:                             The success of the Government's programs faces
the following significant risks:  (1) the
vigor of the economic recovery in Jamaica and
the impact this will have on the overall trade
balance; (ii) the impact of the tariff changes
and the removal of quantitative restrictions
on imports and exports; (iii) the impact on
both domestic and foreign investor confidence
and the effect this could have on industrial
investment, production and exports; (iv) the
level of national support to carry out the
programs; and (v) the administrative capacity
and commitment of the Government to carry out
the adjustment programs. Some of the risks
are beyond the Government's and the country's
control. The Government has, however,
demonstrated a willingness to take politically
difficult economic actions. In so doing, it
has continued to enjoy national support. As a
result, the risks associated with the project
are acceptable.



INTERNATIONAL BANK FOR RECONS2'RUCTION AND DEVELOPMENT
REPORT AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE PRBSIDENT
TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS ON A
PROPOSED LOAN TO JAMAICA FOR A
TRADE AND FIMANCIAL SECTOR ADJISTMENT LOAN
1. *     I submit the following report and recommendation on a proposed
loan for the equivalent of US$40.0 million to Jamaica for a Trade and
Financial Sector Adjustment Loan. The loan would have a term of 17 years
including 4 years of grace, with interest at the standard variable rate.
PART I - THE ECONOMY1
Introduction
2.       An Economic Report entitled 'Economic Situation and Public
Investment" was distributed to the Executive Directors in April 1985.
Annex I contains the basic country data.
3.       Since Jamaica became independent in 1962, the nation has
experienced three distinct phases of economic performance. Each phase has
been determined by events In the foreign sector accounts and has followed a
course determined largely by the character of domestic reactions to those
events. The first of these, which lasted through the 1960s and somewhat
beyond, was an era of strong growth of real output.  The main factors were
domestic financial stability coupled with direct foreign investment in the
bauxitelalumina and tourism sectors. During this period the nation enjoyed
a steady accumulation of foreign capital and productive facilities. Some
of the growth of production was from newly-established Import-substituting
ind4stries, and their relative Inefficiency proved harmful later in the
decade as unemployment began to climb. Nevertheless, key Jamaican prices
were relatively stable and moved in a pattern that was broadly consistent
with price movements internationally.
4.       The second phase was very nearly the opposite of the first.  Early
in the 1970s, production began to fall. Sharp increases in Jamaica's
petroleum import bill occurred, but were more than compensated by rising
bauxite/alumina related earnings. The, public sector grew rapidly as
Government attempted to boost employm.t. Domestic monetary and credit
expansion accelerated, local prices diverged from international prices, and
a sharp erosion of physical and financial capital occurred. Finally, the
structure of incentives became increasingly biaed toward the production of
nontradable goods and services rather than production for export.
1/ Parts I, Il, III and IV of this report and of the President's Report
for the companion Public Enterprise Sector Adjustment loan are
identical.



-2-
Recent Develogments
5.       In 1980, the country entered a third phase when the Jamaican
Government launched an ambitious economic recovery and sdjustment progr,s
aimed at restoring economic growth and correcting the structural imbalance
in the external accounts. To this end, since 1981 the Government ha.
entered a series of arrangements with tV'3 International Monetary Fund and
has received three structural adjustment loans from the World Bank. This
recovery program has been hampered by adverse external events. When the
initial stabilization and structural adjustment program was formulated In
1981182, Jamaica was exporting about 12 million tons of bauxitelalumina
with gross export earnings of about US$669 million, or 752 of total
merchandise exports. The assumption that this level of output would be
maintained proved to be seriously wrong. By 1985 it became evident that
the fall in volume and earnings, to about US$280 million, was not a
temporary phenomenon, but a reflection of more fundamental problems within
the sector and the worldwide oversupply situation.
6.       The decline in the bauxitelalumina sector in Jamaica has provided
a graphic Illustration of the openness of the economy, and its
vulnetravlity to the external sector. The modest real growth that was
recorded in the early 1980's, was offset by negative growth in 1984 and
particularly the sharp decline of 4.2Z in 1985. However, the problem of
the mining sector mask the real adjustments that have occurred in the
economy over the recent past. Agriculture, manufacturing and tourism have
all displayed growth since 1981. Tourism in particular has recovered very
rapidly to become the country's leading foreign currency earner, and with a
122 increase in stopover visitors in 1986 has been a major contributor to a
restoration of real positive growth. This is estimtod to be about 2.21 In
1986. In addition, there has been a significant fiscal adjustment In the
past year, with an estimated overall fiscal deficit of 9.42 of GDP. Thi
compares to a range of 132 to 222 for the previous five years. This fiscal
adjustment has been due to a variety of reform that have boon undertaken
since FY82/83, and which are now becoming effective. First, there has been
a significant improvement in tax revenue, as a result of Increased fuel
taxes accruing to the Government following the oil price doclines, Uproved
tax administration and higher stamp duties on imports. Second, there ha
been substantial restructuring and reduction of both current and capital
expenditures of the Central Government. Third, there has been continued
improvement in the financial performance of the public entorprises due
primrily to Increased tariffs for the major utilities. In additlon, over
the past three years, the structural composition of the overall public
sector deficit has been changing. While very dramatic reductions in the
Central Government's deficit have been achleved, the Bank of Jamaica '(30)
has incurred heavy deficits as a result of foreign exchange losses atising
out of the large devaluations. For example, the deficit of the Central
Government and public enterprises declined from 14.52 of GDP In FY81/82 to
an estimated 8.82 of GDP in FY85186, but Bank of Jamaica losses--which were
negligible in FY81/82--rose to 7.12 of GDP by FY85/86 thereby reducing the
apparent fiscal adjustment.
7.       Furthermore, progress has been made in restoring viability to the
balance of payments. The substantial devaluations of the J$ in 1984 and
1985 have caused the import level to fall back, and this now stands below



-3-
the level rocorded in FY8081. Iore rocently, the decline to internatioa
oil prices has resulted in a *gin of about US$100 million In f78 7,
equivalent to about 42 of GDP. This ha. olo ehanced the cost
competitiveness of the bouxitoellum    sector 'hich uses oil fired
smlters.  On the export side, thoro has been signficant growth in touris
revenues, with a doublig of net receipts over the past aix yers. I3-
traditional exports outside the CARICO  mrket hve grown from U8S80
millios in FY80181 to US$144 million In 1Y85186, with a strong increas
(about 502) for the two years following th. major devaluations In early
FY84185. This rapid growth disappared in 1Y86187, due possibly to the
maintenane of the exchange rate of J35.50 to US$1.00 and the consequent
appreciation of the real effective exchange rate by about 12 to 142 by
December, 1986. Under the preseAt Stand-by program with the Ill (see
par, 12), the Government has iplemented a scheme for manufactured exports
providing for a duty rebate of 7.52 In 1Y87/88, and this Is epected to
restore the momentum in growth of non-traditional manufactured exports.
Restoration of earlier export levels for traditional products (sugar and
bananas) has been dlsappointing; however, the ongoing rehabilitation
program for the banana industry is now progressing well, with exports in
1986 twvice the level recorded in 1980.

8.       With tbese developments, the current account of the baloace of
payments has improved significantly. Provisional esstmates suggest a
deficit of about 7.51 of GDP In FY86/87, about half the levol recorded In
the previous two year. Simultaneusly, howover, there has been a
substantial build-up in external debt, to US$3.5 billion (1512 of GDP) as
of March 31, 1987. Though much of tUs external debt has been accumulated
on reasonable terms, the decline in export earnings has resulted In a stoep
rise In the debt service ratio, to a level of 722 before reschedullag, or
about 51 after rescheduling for FY86187. The World Bank now holds 14.82
of debt outstanding and obligations owing to the IMF are equivalent to 3652
of quota as of March 31, 1987.

The I1 and the TriDartite Mission
9.       Jamaica has entered into four separate arrangements with the IN?
since 1980, an Extended Fund Facility (EFF) arrangement in March 1981, a
one-year Stand-by covering FY84185, a 22-month Stand-by approved in June
1985, and the present Stand-by program which was approved in March 1987.
Coinciding with the decline of bauxitelalumina exports, Jamaica has had
severe difficulties in maintaining compliance with the stabilization
program.  The main reasons for this have been due to over-optimism
concerning the level of expected foreign exchange earnings including the
disbursements of external assistance, the lack of speedy reaction by
Govern-ent authorities to changed circumstances, and & me slowness in
implementing agreed adjustment measures.
10.      After the failure to attain the targets under the third IMF
arrangement in September 1985, the Prime Minister requested the Managing
Director of the IMF, in cooperation with the President of the World Bank
and the Administrator of the United States Agency for International
Development (USAID) to mount a tripsrtite 'fresh eyes' mission to Jamaica
to review the situation, and identify policies which would be expected to
reestablish economic growth. The mission visited Jamaica in January-
February 1986, and presented its report to the Government in mid-April
1986. The most Important conclusions of the mission were as follows:
(i)  the macro-policy mix was inappropriate.  In particular, the
report found that monetary policy was too tight, and that the
exchange rate was consequently being repressed to the
disadvantage of exporters. Furthenmore, the mission emphasised
that inadequate progress had been made on fiscal policy. Thus,
it recommended a program of major fiscal adjustment to reduce
the crowding out of private sector investment and the relaxing
of exchange rate policy to promote export diversification and
sustainable growth;



(ii) to achieve fiscal adjustment, a major contribution should be
sought from the public enterprises, both through Improved
financial performance and through divestment;
(iII) in addition to a lesser emphasis on tight monetary policy,
instruments of monetary poli.y should be reformed in such a way
as to remove bias against the private sector;
(iv) the trade and incentives system, though lproved over the whole
structural adjustment period, still wa In need of reform to
remove remaining anti-export bias;
(v) programs to protect the poor during the period of adjustment
deserved support, but should be adequately targeted, rather
than in the form of generalized subsidies; and
(vi) continued high levels of external assistance would be required
and justified if Government were to undertake a major
adjustment effort, and much of this assistance would need to be
concessional policy-based assistance, disbursing as balance of
payments support.
1I.      The Government accepted the medium-term objectives proposed, but
expressed reservations about the implied pace of adjustment and the use of
further exchange rate devaluations. As a result, the 22-month Stand-by
with the IMF, ihich was Inoperative since March 1986, was cancelled In July
1986. However, by December 1986, agreement was finally reached on a new
Stand-by to run from March 1987 to March 1988. During the recent intensive
policy dialogue with the IMF and the Bank, the Government has reduced Its
public investment plans and implemented further revenue measures, with the
result that the overall fiscal deficit for FY86187 has declined
significantly to about 9.42 of GDP. In adoition, balance of payments
performance has proven to be better then projected by the Tripartite
Mission, mostly as a result of better than foreseen tourism revenues, lower
service payments, and a lower oil bill.
12.      The new Stand-by arrangement addresses some of the issues
identified above in para 10(i), more specifically, the need for further
fiscal adjustment and monetary policy reforms. It also contemplates
exchange rate adjustment, shuuld the planned increase in foreign reserves
not materialise, and limits wage increases and inflation to protect
competitiveness. This Stand-By arrangement and the Compensatory Financing
Facility (CFF) purchase for SDR85.0 million and SDR40.9 million
respectively, will support a further reduction in the overall fiscal
deficit to 5.42 of GDP in FY87188. In addition, monetary policy is to be
closely monitored, with a programmed growth in broad money of 102. In the
balance of payments, the current account deficit is targeted to further
improve in 1Y87/88, recording a deficit of about 6.32 of GDP. The proposed
sector adjustment loan, along with the companion Trade and Financial Sector
Adjustment Loan would help address issues (ii), (iiI) and (iv). The third
member of the Tripartite Mission, USAID, is assisting the Government In
formulating a program to address Issue (v) through the introduction of a
food stamp and other targetted subsidy programs. Finally, the Bank, as
Chairman of the Caribbean Group for Cooperation in Economic Development



(CGCED), is coordinating external assistance to Jamaica to address Issue
(vi). The two proposed sectoral operations would form an integral part of
the external assistance to be mobilised In support of the adjustment
program.
PART II - PROGRESS ACHIEVED IN STRUCTURAL ADJUSTMENT
Introduction
13.      Three structural adjustment loans (SALs) have been made to Jamaica
by the Bank sin;e 1982, for a total of US$190 million together with
structural reform efforts undertaken with the assistance of USAID.
Nevertheless, In 1987 Jamaica's economic situation demands that additional
adjustment and further structural policy reforms be taken to restore longer
term viability and sustained growth. The scope of reforms already
undertaken was designed on the basis of a set of assumptions about the
external environment which have proved to be incorrect. This relates In
particular to assumptions concerning the bauxitelalumina sector. Indeed,
if net earnings from the bauxite/alumina sector had been the same in
FY85/86 as in FY80181, and assuming the same degree of policy reform, then
the current account deficit on the balance of payments would have been 8.4S
instead of 14.21 of GDP and the fiscal deficit would been 7.31 instead of
15.91 of GDP. Tho amount of adjustment required to restore viability and
growth to the Jamaican economy has therefore been a moving target, with the
attainment of objectives always being steps ahead of the most recent
adjustment program.   However, recent 1improvements In Jamalca's balance of
payments and fiscal accounts, together with an improved internatinal
outlook for the bauxite and alumina sector provide a better basis for tho
eountry to take advantage of the reforms already undertaken. The previous
structural adjustment measures have laid a good basis on which to build the
next phase of adjustment. The policy reforms that were carried out under
the first three SALs are described in Annex III.  Of particular importance
are the moves to a more realistic exchange rate, removal of distortions in
the trade regime, reforms of the tax system, reforms of public investment
programming, improved public enterprise perfotmance, and rejuvenation of
the agricultural sector. Details of the main reforms that have been
carried out to date are outlined below.
The Foreiin Exchanet Allocation Mechanism
14.      The foreign exchange allocation mechanism has evolved gradually
from a tightly controlled, restrictive fixed market regime, to a flexibly
managed system. In 1980, there wa a fixed exchange rate of J$1.78 =
US$1.00, and official foreign exchange was allocated administratively, in
conjunction with the import licensing regime. This has evolved, through a
variety of interim foreign exchange allocation systems, to the present
auction system, which permits bidding by all potential users of foreign
exchange. Under the new exchange arrangements, the Jamaica dollar
depreciated In real effective terms by about 451 from the third quarter of
1983 to the third quarter of 1985. After a further drop in October 1985,
when the exchange rate briefly reached J$6.40 per US dollar the authorities
stabilized the exchange rate at J$5.50 per US dollar in November 1985 by
increasing supply to the auction. This managed auction system has
continued in place to the present.

15.      The Government believes that the real effective depreciation that
has occurred since 1983 is sufficient to improve export competitiveness and
that a return to a fully floating system would be highly destabilizing at
this time, with a high risk of social disturbance. However, the ability of
the Goverrment to maintain the present nominal exchange rate Is crucially
dependent upon its success in bringing the fiscal deficit down, keeping
monetary growth under control and ensuring that nominal wage adjustments
economy wide are modest. Under the present IMF Stand-by arrangement, the
Government is committed to allow the exchange rate to adjust further in the
event the FY87188 reserve targets are not being met, or the real effective
exchange rate appreciates significantly.
She Trade Regime
16.     At the start of the program in 1980, there was a rigid import
licensing system covering all Imports, backed by some 364 specific
quantitative restrictions (QRs) which offered strong domestic protection.
Together with the overvalued exchange rate, these were considered the main
sources of anti-export bias in the economy In January 1982, the first set
of 60 QRs were removed as a first step in a five-year program to gradually
eliminate all such restrictions. Import licensing has been progressively
liberalized, such that by April 1984, most raw materils and capital goods
wero removed from licensing. In April 1985 licensing was abolished on all
Imports and the remaining qRs were removed, except for those items Imported
by the Jamaica Commodity Trading Company (JCTC), items restricted for
security reasons and for some agricultural items. While this was two years
ahead of schedule, it do"s not appear to have caused severe dislocation,
although a limited number of processed agricultural products were
subsequently placed again on the QR list.
Th. Financial Policy Reform Program
17.      It was recognized early in the adjustment process that the capital
mrket had an important role to play in the economic recovery program.
Under the Technical Assistance Loan (Loan No. 2106-JM) which accompanied
the first SAL, a study of the capital market and any constraints to its
enhanced performance was comuissioned. Upon completion of this study, it
became evident that these questions were linked to broader issues within
the financial sector, and the Government requested the Bank to undertake a
financial sector study.  This was undertaken at the beginning of 1985 and a
report was presonted to Government In April 1985. It examined four main
areas: (i) monetary policy; (ii) interest rate policy; (iII) housing
finance policies and (iv' capital market development. This study forms the
basis for the financial sector component of the proposed Trade and
Financial Sector Adjustment loan; the bulk of reforms considered necessary
have already been taken.
Tax Reform
18.      In 1983 the Government launched a major research exercise with
asistance from USAID to develop a comprehensive tax reform program. This
work vas essentially completed in mid-1985, at which time the Government
established a Parliamentary Commission to examine its findings and make
reconmendations for implementation. The Government introduced in January



- 8 -
1986 a revised personal income taxi a revised property tax system in July
1986 and a revised corporate income tax in January 1987. The next step is
the introduction of a General Consumption Tax to replace most existing
indirect taxes by May 1988.
19.      The reform is far reaching.  Under the previous personal income
tax, the initial threshold for taxes war, about US$500 per year and the
maxismum rate of 561 applied on income ovsr US$2,500 per annum. The result
of this was pervasive evasion, with ever increasing percentages of income
being received in non-taxable form, such as housing and travel allowances.
The sweeping reform introduced in January 1986 raises the Initial tax
threshold to about US$1,500 per anmum, and taxes all income, including that
received in kind and interest income at a flat rate of 33-1/3S. The reform
achieves four main aims:  (a) the poor are relieved of any income tax
burden; (b) the incentives to work are increased by reducing high marginal
rates; (c) the tax base is broadened by eliminating tax exempt income; and
(d) tax administration is greatly simplified. The revised corporate income
tax also represents a substantial advance on the previous system. The tex
rate was reduced to 33-1/3Z (from 451), with increased provisions for loss
carry forward and adjustment of investment and depreciation allowances. As
a result of these reforms, tax revenues from income have increased by 271
in FY85186 and are expected to increase by a further 301 in PY86187.
20.      The present system of indirect taxes (excise duties, consumption
duties, retail sales taxes and other selective taxes and stamp duties) is
highly complex, particularly when both excise and consumption duties are
levied on the same goods at the same level of production. There is an
excessive number of rates, many of which require frequent legislative
action to adjust. Finally, there is limited taxation of services despite
their growing importance in the economy. The Committee on Tax Reform
finalized the preliminary report on adjusting this situation in July 1986,
and a Geaneral Consumption Tax to replace all of these indirect taxes is
expected to be enacted soon. This tax will have a much broader base, with
a greatly reduced number of rates, and exemptions only on some basic
commodities and exports. While the revenue impact would be neutral, it
would reduce distortions, simplify the system and increase tax buoyancy.
In addition, introduction of the General Consumption tax will help in the
implementation action of further steps of the Tariff Reform program. This
would ensure that both imports and domestically produced goods receive
equal treatment with respect to indirect taxation.
Public EnterDrises and Fiscal Adiustment
21.      A major stated aim of the Government, since the commencement of
the country's present structural adjustment exercise, has been to reduce
the size of the public sector in the economy via sale or lease of assets
and to improve the financial performance of both the Central Government and
the public enterprises. Some progress has been achieved. The Government
has eukbarked upon an Administrative Reform Progrsm, with World Bank
asslstdice (Loan No. 2423-JM), a major component of which has been a phased
introduction of performance budgeting and improved financial management
systems. Central Government current expenditure in relation to GDP has
declined steadily throughout the adjustment program from 32.1% of GDP in
FY81/82 to 27.71 in FY85/86, notwithstanding an increase in interest
expenditures on external debt, equivalent to 3.01 of GDP.  This adjustment



- 9 -
has been brought about by a decline in wages, following substantial labor
retrenchment in FY84/85 and FY85186, particularly in local government and
in the temporary, non established work force. There has also been a
reduction in real wages of tho public work force.  Nominal wage increases
averaged 112 and 151 in FY84/85 and FY85186, respectively, while price
inflation vas about 272 and 262 in both years. In addition, there has been
a steady decline in current transfers to support a variety of urban
services, including the elimination of the subsidy for the provision of
rural water, which is now covered by increased water tariffs of the
National Water Commission. Simultaneously, there has been a steady decline
in Central Government capital expenditures from abonut 122 of GDP in FY81182
to about 5% in FY85/86. These reductions have affected the supporting
economic infrastructure, particularly roads and the maintenance of the
capital stock in the health and education sectors; this declining trend
however, was forestalled In FY86/87.
22.      Within the context of the structural adjustment pcogram, attention
has been focused on the 18 largest public enterprises. Of these, the
Banana Company has been divested and the sugar industry is presently
undergoing restructure and reorganization; the remaining sixteen
enterprises are the subject of the proposed sector adjustment operation.
In FY80181, the consolidated operating surplus of this targeted group was
J$4.5 million (on sales of over J$1.5 billion), or 0.1% of GDP with net
transfers of J$147.2 million (3.02 of GDP) from the Central Government.
Large losses were recorded in the National Sugar Company, National Hotels
and Properties, Air Jamaica and the Jamaica Omnibus Service (since
dissolved). This poor performance continued to FY82183. In general, the
poor consolidated operating results in the period FY80181-FY82/83 arose
primarily from a failure to adjust prices, at a time when capital and
overall expenditures were increasing rapidly. To remedy this, a number of
pricing measures were Introduced in FY83184. In November 1983, water and
sewerage tariffs were increased by an average of 671; electricity tariffs
were raised by an average of 402 in January 1984 to reflect the higher cost
of fuel and petroleum product prices; the latter were also raised in mid-
1983, with gasoline prices rising by 502. These measures, together with
further Improvements in operating efficiencies, had the desired benoficial
results, and the operating surplus for FY83184 improved to J$197.6 million
(2.92 of GDP); net transfers from Central Government declined to J$115.7
million (1.71 of GDP). Further price adjustments occurred in FY84185 for
water (691), electricity (542), telephone services (501 to 1002), basic
foods (451 to 1602), and petroleum products (231), with the result th*t the
consolidated surplus improved to J$370.4 million (4.0% of GDP); Central
Government transfers declined marginally in relative terms. This
improvement continued in FY86/87; the estimated operating surplus is
expected to reach J$1227.3 million, equivalent to 9.61 of GDP.
23.      The Government is committed to continue its efforts.  The hotel
leasing program is now completed, with the result that operating losses of
the National Hotels and Properties have been eliminated. Two publicly-
owned sugar factories are being reorganized, with a view to production of
ethanol for export, and the remaining operations being brought under a
foreign management contract. The National Sugar Company has been replaced
with a debt free holding company, with past accumulated losses to be
absorbed by the Central Government. The Banana Company, as noted, has been
divested, and othor entities have been targeted for similar treatment. The



- 10 -
J_maica Broadcasting Company, for example, Is to be radically altered with
a variety of its facilities to be leased to private sector operators. The
broadcasting company has improved both service and financlal viability.
Finally, the water utility has been reformed and restructured with a
resultant improvement in the quality of service.
The Public Sector Investment Progran
24.      A major effort has been made to improve the quality of the
preparation, execution and monitoring of the public sector investment
program (PSIP). The main features of the revisions to the PSIP system hove
been: the establishment of a rolling three-year investment program
greater balance in the program with the emphasis being placed on economic
infrastructure and support for the export effort; the introduction of a
monitoring system, which produces quarterly progress reports; the
establishment of an inter-ministerial committee, chaired by the Prime
Minister, to approve the PSIP and individual projects; the application of
more appropriate project selection criteria within sectors, and the
Integration of the PSIP process with the budget process, such that tho
first year of the PSIP is now identical with the capital formation
component of the budget.
Structural Adlustment and Poverty Alleviation
25.      Successive governments in Jamaica have attached considerable
Importance to the alleviatlon of poverty over the past twenty years and
progress has been achieved. Life expectancy at birth has risen (presently
72.5 years at birth); calorie intakes average about 1202 of daily
requirements; there is universal access to primary education and about 852
of the population has accoss to safe water. However, the porvasive
transformation and structural adjustment of tho economy over the past six
years, has affected income distribution, poverty and the quality and
quantity of government services. A Household Expenditure Survey was
completed in early 1985, and results suggest that real consumption has
fallen since 1975, as the economy has stagnated. However, there has boem a
moderate decrease in income inequality suggesting that adjustment has been
spread throughout the economy. In addition, there has been an ncreas In
the self employed, particularly in non-agricultural aroas, and a decline in
Government employment. Progress has been made In reducing unemployment,
however, the level is qtill high, and estimated to be between 20X to 232 of
the work force. The Government operates a variety of public assistance
programs to support the poorest sections of the community. There is a food
stamp program, a school lunch program, and a special nutrition program for
groups at high risk of malnutrition (pregnant wmen, lactating mothers and
pre-school children). The Government also subsidizes the prices of certain
basic foodstuffs through the pricing policy of JCTC. In addition, there
are a variety of Government agencies designed to Improve vocational
training for school leavers. Under the two proposed sector adjustmaent
operations, the reforms that will be undertaken are not expected to create
greater hardships for the poorer sections of the Jamaican comsmunty.
Reforms in the public enterprise sector should help to improve efficiency
over the medium term, thereby reducing costs and improving the level and
quality of services provided. Furthermore, explicit offorts are to be made
to review the food subsidy program to ensure that the targetted benefits
accrue to those most in need. Under the proposed Trade and Financial
sector adjustment loan, the tariff reform program is to be phased gradually



- 11 -
over a period of four years, and in recognition of the need to mitigate
some of the social costs of adjustment, no basic foodstuffs are included in
those groups of zero tariff Items which will have a positive tariff applied
by March 1988. In addition, the whole tariff reform program is designed to
allow the economy to become more competitive in those areas of production
which tend to have relatively high labor/capital ratios. Therefore, in the
medium term, as the tariff reform progresses, the pace of job creation
should increase significant,, benefitting the presently unemployed and
future school leavers.
PART III - PROSPECTS FOR THE JAMAICAN ECONOMY - 1986/87 - 1990/91
26.      The economic outlook for the Jamaican economy is dependent upon
timely policy action, to reduce the fiscal deficit considerably over the
next two to three years, and to adjust tho exchange rate system, should
domestic cost and price inflations exceed that prevailing in Jamaica's
major trade partners and competitors. With these key reforms, and with the
adoption of the reform programs to be supported by this and the
accompanying Trade and Financial Sector Adjustment loan, a major
contribution will have been made to a restoration of growth and balance of
paymonts viability. However, this growth will continue to be dependent
upon large inflows of concessional assistance from donors, especially over
the next three years but at a reduced level compared to the period 1983 to
1985. Furthermore, given the debt burden facing Jamaica, and the extent of
the structural Imbalance since the collapse of bauxitelalumina exports, it
is expected that only a modest increase in living standards can be achieved
before FY90/91.
The Domestic Sector
27.      Given the present tighter financial situation which will inhibit
public sector investment growth, it is considered unlikely that GDP growth
will be as high in FY87/88 as in FY86/87. However, this growth should pick
up steadily to reach about 3.52 in real terms per annum by 1992. To
achieve these higher growth rates, consumption should increase modestly
over the next four years (at about 1.5X per annum). This will require that
the present tax effort is maintained and that monetary policy is conducted
in a manner that ensures a modest growth of consumer credit. If
consumption increases faster, resources for investment will be preempted
and the prospects for growth will worsen.
28.      A program of sustained growth and adjustment must be based on
increased domestic savings. If, after a period, the average savings rate
does rise, this would lay the groundwork for further growth and for future
increases in-consumption. The program of adjustment is predicated on gross
domestic savings increasing by about 8.5% per annum, in real terms, from
1986 to 1991, such that the ratio of domestic savings to GDP would increase
from 8.72 in FY86/87 to 14.82 in FY90191. Under this scenario, marginal
savings rates, both public and private, must increase over the next few
years, with public savings accounting for about 342 of total domestic
savings by 1990.



- 12 -
29.      The reduction in the public sector deficit in the first year is
asst.med to be accomplished mainly through increased Central Government
re4enues resulting from additional tax measures and a maintenance of
present tax receipts from oil products, and declines in expenditures from
the postponement of non-priority investments and Improved public enterprise
management. Subsequent mprovements are predicated on modest growth in
current expenditures, continued Improvements in public enterprise
performance, as well as revenues obtained through divestiture. Such
improvements in the public sector would permit tie overall public sector
deficit (including the BOJ) to decline from an estimated 9.42 of GDP in
FY86187 to 2.22 in FY91192.
30.      This scenario of growth and adjustment can be realized only if the
ratio of total investment to GDP rises from 12.42 to about 16.02 by
FY91192. The growth in public sector investment is expected to be modest
such that by FY91192, this investment would be about 9.02 of GDP. While it
might be desirable to raise that rate, there is little room for maneuver
within the Central Government budget, given the large interest payments.
With this projected level of GDP and investment, a modest decline in
unemployment of about 3 to 42 should occur primarily through growth in
labor-intensive export oriented activities. Projections for the domestic
accounts are shown in Table 4.
31.      The leading sector for the economy over the next decade will be
tourism, followed by continued growth in non-traditional manufacturing and
agriculture, and as such investment should be concentrated in these areas.
Very little growth is projected in the bauxite/alumina and sugar sectors,
however, as the banana rehabilitation program continues, it is projected
that banana output should double by 1990, with more modest growth
thereafter. Given that there is considerable underutilized capacity in the
economy and that the ratio of private to public investment will increase,
it Is expected that the incremental capital output ratio (ICOR) will
decline over the next five years to reach about 4.8 by FY91/92. The levels
of investment shown in these economic projections are based on this ICOR
assumption, which is similar to that assumed by the Tripartite Mission's
report.
The External Accounts
32.      Exports of goods and non-factor services are projected to grow at
3.12 a year in real terms, from FY85186 to FY90/91. This overall growth
rate includes a higher growth rate of 122 a year in constant prices for
non-traditional exports outside CARICOM; an increase in tourism earnings of
8.82 per year; and a small growth of other exports. It can be argued that
the decline in the bauxite sector has been arrested and that some small
growth can be expected in the future, especially if oil prices do not
increase significantly. Imports are projected in the scenario to grow
slightly lower than the growth rate of GDP. Despite Import substitution
efforts, particularly in agriculture, the economy, and especially exports,
will continue to depend on significant amounts of imported capital goods
and raw materials. These growth projections are based upon the continued
existence of a competitive exchange rate. As such, careful monitoring of
the real effective exchange rate will be necessary with prompt adjustments
being made when appropriate.



- 13 -
33.       Significant biprovements are projected in the current account
balance relative to GDP (from a deficit of 14.22 of GDP in FY85186 to a
deficit of 1.02 of GDP by FY90191) and in the debt/GDP and debt/export
ratios. Annual flows of foreign capital to ths public sector are projected
to decline over the next decade, after FY87188, both in gross and in net
terms. However, because of the large amounts of annual amortisation of
existing debt, even modest net capital inflows must involve large gross
financing. The requirement for balance of payments support will decline
after FY88/89 to a level in FY90/91 nearly half that required in FY85/86.
In addition to new capital inflows, substantial debt rescheduling, both by
commercial banks and official creditors, amounting in total to about US$460
million, Is also assumed to continue through 1989190. Beyond 1990 there
would be no need for further rescheduling. The scenario assumes that
private capital inflow over the period will remain constant at about US$50
million per year. Whether this materialixes or not will depend greatly on
Jamaica's exchange and interest rate policies, as well as other factors
that influence decisions on foreign equity investment, such as the presence
of the proper regulatory framework and the absence of exchango controls.

34.       Under this projection framework, and on the critical assumption
that Jamaica successfully continues with the main macroeconomic reform
program described above, the external financing gap is closed for FY87/88.
For Ff88189 to FY91192 there is an external financing gap equivalent to
about 3.51 of GDP (about US$105 million), which will need to be filled by
balance of payments support by traditional multilateral and bilateral
sources, as well as, if possible, by new donors . Assuming this flow of



- 14 -
external rosources is forthcoming, together with the maintenance of project
aid flows at levels siilar to that pertaining over the past three years,
the country should be considered creditworthy. Jamaica is continuing to
ree ive substantial financial assistance from the IMF, bilateral donors and
other multilatoral development banks. The Goverrnent of Jamaica has
recently concluded rescheduling agreements with the Paris Club on March 5,
1987 and with the commercial banks on March 10, 1987. The situation,
however, Is not without risks. The Bank's exposure in Jamaica is high at
14.81 of debt outstanding and disbursed, and this exposure will increase
with the two proposed sector adjustment operations to about 15 52 of debt
outstanding and disbursed. However, the economic projections, together
with the attendant financing plan, indicate that this exposure would
decline from 1988 on, to about 132 of debt outstanding and disbursed by
1995, and IBRD debt service is expected to decline from 6.4Z of exports in
1987 to 4.2Z by 1995.
35.      The projections outlined above are cautious and the growth targets
achievable. It should be noted, however, that the economy is still
vulnerable to external shocks, particularly with regard to major Increases
in oil prices or to disruptions that affect the 6rowth of the tourist
sector. Should either of these events occur, then the balance of payments
could deteriorate rapidly, which would aggravate the already signiflcant
debt service burden and reduce the pace of GDP growth. Furthermore, the
balance of payments is very sonsitive to changes in the pricoe of bauxite
and alumina. If prices decline by 102, below that presently projected,
then the current account deficit in FY90/91 would be US$46 million higher
(equivalent to 1.51 of GDP) and the cumulative financing gap from FY88189
to FY90191 would inereaso by US$130 million. These vulnerabilities
indicate that the country's medium-term economic framework and overall
creditworthiness can chango rapidly and as a result will require continued
monitoring. In particular, prior to second tranche release, compliance
with this medium-term framework, and its attendant external financing plan,
will be reviewed.

PART IV - CONTINUING THE ADJUSTMENT PROCESS
The Proposed Sector AdJustment Loans ad the Macroeconomic Framework
36.      Achievement of the growth and balance of payments targets proposed
is contingent upon a continued program of structural reform which the
proposed Trade and Financial Sector and Public Enterprise Sector Adjustment
loons are designed to support. While broader issues related to monetary,
fiscal and exchange rate policies are being pursued in the context of the
prosent Stand-by arrangement with the IMF, the two sector adjustment loans
are designed to Improve tho incentive framework facing exporters and
Improve the operational efficiency of public enterprises. The
Interrelationship between the two proposed sector adjustment loans and the
stabilisation program are very close, with each depending on the success of
the other. The choice of the two sectors follows in natural sequence the
prior reform. undertaken. The reform program undertaken in FY87188 would
provide a solid foundation for other needed reform measures. In
particular, future attention would be directed toward further restructuring
of the public enterprise sector and to measures necessary to improve the
agricultural sector's performance. Furthermore, as the tariff reform
progresses ln the second and third years, attention would be directed
toward the industrial sector to facilitate the transition to a more
competitive, and less protected, trading environment.
Tho Proposed Ector &dlustment Loans and Relations with the IM? Arranpement
37.      The two proposed sector adjustment loans would be both supportive
of and dependent on policies agreed to as part of the framework underlying
the arrangement with the IMF. Inherent within the present Stand-by
arrngement is the goal of a further reduction in the overall fiscal
deficit, strengthening of the international reserve position and avoidance
of a rapid appreciation of the real exchange rate of the Jamaican dollar.
In particular, If the real exchange rate appreciates significantly without
appropriate adjustment of the nominal exchange rate, then the reforms In
the trade and tariff regime would be much less likely to encourage the
development of exports, and vould be likely to result in further
dislocation In the manufacturing sector, with Imports replacing domestic
production. Similarly, It will be much harder to achieve reforms in the
financial sector If the fiscal deficit remains high. Clearly, one
implication of the removal of bias against private sector Interest rates
and of the goals of the financial sector reforms, will be higher rates to
the public sector but If the fiscal deficit is not controlled then crowding
out of the private sector could increase.
38.      The two proposed sector adjustment loans would also contribute to
the achievement of the targets of the program with the IMNt
(1) Fiscal deficit: of the projected fiscal improvement about
half would come from the reduction in oil prices and
improvement in tax administration and most of the balance
In FY87/88 would come from improved savings of the public
enterprises and divestment under the action programs of the
proposed sector adjustment loan;



- 16 -
(it) Financial golicys the revised financial policy being
supported by the proposed Trade and Financial Sector
Adjustment loan would be directly supportive of the broad
macro economic framework, and would improve monetary
management In generall
(iII) Balsnce of iaymentst the achievement of viability in the
balance of payments is critically dependent on the growtn
of non-traditional exports, and this in turn Is dependent
upon reform in the tariff regime and the general incentives
to export implied by these reforms.
39.      Ultimately, however, the crucial interdependence of the two
proposed sector adjustment loans and the IMF arrangement comes from their
collective Impact on the restoration of growth. Without economic growth,
the prospects for success in any of the programs are severely dampened, not
only because of the political and social difficulties that would result,
but also because of the nature of the economy. Jamaica is and will remain
import dependent, and the achievement of viability in the balance of
payments will be determined to a large extent by the ability of the economy
to generate nw exports and to control the fiscal deficit. The proposed
aggregate set of policies, both macro and sectoral, are designed to
provide room for private sector activity, and to expand nontraditional
exports with growth being centered on those areas which will contribute to
the achievement of longer-term viability.
Policy-Based and Proiect Lending 2
40.      Thera continues to be a close relationship between the Bank's
policy-based lending and traditional project lending. Two of the ongoing
projects have particular relevance to the Public Enterprise .*ctor
Adjustment loan: the Water Supply and Sewerage Technical Assistance and
Rehabilitation Loan (2423-JM) is addressing the financial and technical
performance of the National Water Commission; and the Public Administration
Reform Project (2433-3M) is addressing the management of the public sector
in general, and of the Ministry of Finance in narticular. In addition, the
ongoing Industrial Credit Project (2294-JM) and Exports Crops Project
(2414-IM) are providing credit to the sectors that trade reform is designed
to encourage.
41.      Several projects whiCh are expected to be presented to the
Executive Directors for approval In the coming months will continue this
process. The proposed Second Sugar Rehabilitation Project is designed to
address the efficiency of the public sugar sector, thus improving public
finances, as well as rationalizing the amount of land utilized for sugar,
and releasing good land for the development of nontraditional export crops.
The proposed Population and Health Project and the Fourth Education Project
would contain components which wmuld examine the financing of the health
and education sectors, and design cost recovery programs in theso sectors.
Finally, the proposed Fourth Power Project would not only continue to
improve the infrastructural base for development, but also concentrate on
the efficiency of the power generation company, with the aim of lowering
the unit cost of electricity production.
2/ Full details on past Bank lending were distributed to the Board, in the
Country Brief dated March 31, 1987.

Loan Amount and Cofinancing
42.      It is proposed that the Public Enterprises Sector Adjustment loan
and the Trade and Financial Sector Adjustment loan should be for US$20
million and US$40 million respectively. Both loans would be made available
in two equal tranches. This compares to the amounts of US$75 million,
US$60 million, and US$55 million for SALs I-III respectively. No
cofinancing is envisaged for this loan. The two proposed sector adjustment
operations together would represent about 5.5% of Jamaica's import
requirements in FY87/88, about 92 of Jamaica's gross financing needs, and
about 252 of net public capital financing needs over the current fiscal
year.
PART V DEVELOPMENT ISSUES AND ACTION PROGRAMS
43.      A key objective of the on-going adjustment program in Jamaica has been
the progressive elimination of distortions in production and in resource
mobilization and allocation created by excessive direct Government
intervention. Despite the progress made through adoption of a flexible exchange
rate policy and reductions in import licensing requirements and quantitative
restrictions (para. 16 above), the trade regime continues to encourage
excessively (i) manufacturing relative to agriculture, mining and tourism;
(ii) domestic market oriented production relative to export production; and
(iii) final goods production relative to production of capital and intermediate
goods. Nevertheless, the growth of non-traditional exports during 1985 and 1986
(see para. 46) suggest that the changes of trade and exchange rate policies are
having a positive impact on industrial efficiency.
44.       The proposed loan would support a major new phase In the Government's
trade reform program which aims at dismantling the remaining distortions in
favor of a broach based and more uniform tariff structure with appropriate
incentives for exports. In the financial sector, the biases against private
investment and equity investments would be removed by eliminating distortions in
the interest rate structure and minimizing the constraints on efficient
functioning of capital markets.

Trade PolicZ Reform
Recent Trends in Manufacturing Industry and Exports
45.      After a long period of decline during the 1970s, manufacturing
production resumed moderate growth during 1981 through 1983. Production
declined again in 1984 but stabilized in 1985 as restructuring of the sector
strengthened industrial export orientation. Manufacturing value added Increased
In 1985 by about 1%, mostly as the result of the rapid growth of the Kingston
Free Zone (KFZ), which is supported by Bank Loan No. 2107-JM. Eaterprises in
the KFZ export all their production and operate in a free-trade environment with
practically no administrative or tariff restrictions. In contrast, to other
manufacturing, these enterprises can benefit fully from the improved
opportunities for Jamaican products in export markets. The performsuce of
export industries outside of the KFZ was less dynamic but still satisfactory,
while growth of the import substitution industry was restricted by the ongoing
adjustment process. Preliminary statistics indicate that manufacturing
continued to recover during 1986, although most of the moderate growth occurred
in the -FZ.
46.      Over 75% of Jamaican nontraditional exports are manufactures.  Clothing
has the largest share among manufactured exports. However, processed foods,
beverages and tobacco products, which are characterized by low import content
and high domestic value added, have also become important export products. A
large variety of vegetables are the main nontraditional agricultural exports. A
number of traditional agricultural and manufactured products other than bauxite,
alumina, sugar and bananas, have also gained increasing importance in exports:
citrus, coffee, cacao in both processed and unprocessed form, together with
pimento and rum had an export volume of US$40million In 1985 and their potential
for growth is substantial. Exports of non-traditional and hlgh potential
traditional exports stagnated during 1975 to 1981 at a level of about US$150
million per year, which was largely due to the prevailing strong anti-export
bias of economic policies. Since then, they have achieved moderate growth as
they benefitted from the adjustments of the exchange rate as well as the removal
of most quantitative import and licensing restrictions that hampered access by
exporters to imported inputs. The high potential exports were about US$200
million in 1985, over one-third of total Jamaican exports. The 1986 exports of
this product category are estimated at a somewhat higher level than in 1985.
47.      The recent moderate growth of nontraditional exports has been
constrained by a forced restructuring of both their direction and composition.
Until 1982 the bulk of these exports went to neighboring CARICOM countries.
With CARICOM trade practically collapsing in 1984, a major part of Jamaican
exports has been redirected to new non-CARICOM markets. The product composition
has shifted from chemicals, pharmaceuticals and consumer goods suitable for the
protected regional market to garments, beverages, vegetables and processed foods
which are competitive in North America and Europe. This restructuring of



- 19 -
exports toward new markets and products has been a difficult process, although
it obtained support from the tariff concessions provided by the Caribbean Basin
Initiative (CBI) and other parts of the U.S. tariff code. Recent investments in
export production capacity have been concentrated on better utilizing the
opportunities provided by the U.S. tariff concessions.
48.       The subsectors generatLng most of the non-traditional exports have
already completed a major part of their structural adjustment and would, in many
cases, benefit from a further adjustment of the incentive system, which would
tend to reduce the cost of labor and domestic production Inputs relative to
capital and imported inputs. Many import-substitution industries, on the other
hand, have not yet adjusted sufficiently to achieve improved efficiency and
competitiveness. The trade policy reform program supported by the proposed
loan would help these industries through the provision of an appropriate
incentive framework to take effective steps for the needed adjustment of their
operations; it would also provide incentives for directing part of their
production to export markets.
Trade Policy Issues
49.      Jamaica's trade policy system reflects, to a large extent, the
industrial development strategy of the Caribbean Common Market (CARICON) at the
time of its establishment In the early 1960s. The Common External Tariff (CRT)
which establishes duty rates generally between 0 and 45Z of import value, was
intended to support import substitution and protect the existing industry and
has, therefore, not provided adequate incentives to economic activities with
regional comparative advantage in the international markets. Distortions
created by the CUT on the economy have been increased by stamp duties and
pervasive tariff exemptions. The stamp duties which are imposed on imports on
top of the CRT were introduced in stages between 1980 and May 1985 for the
purposes of providing additional protection to dmeestic industry and generating
fiscal revenue. There are currently 9 different stamp duty rates ranging from
6Z to 952 of the total of Import value plus the CUT.
50.      The duties actually paid on non-CARICOM imports are much lower than
indicated by the statutory CET and stamp duty rates because of widespread tariff
exemptions. The average nominal tariff protection on non-CARICOM imports is
estimated at 36%, compared to actual CUT and stamp duty collection of about 12S
of total imports. Imports by the bauxite industry and imports of fuel, basic
foods and drugs are exempted from duty payment. Furthermore, an estimated 135
Jamaican enterprises have been afforded duty exemption, for 5 to 10 year
periods, on their imports of production inputs and capital goods under
(a) the Industrial Incentives Act and (b) the discretionary right of the
Minister of Finance to grant duty exemptions ("Ministerial remission"). The
latter has been applied in practice mainly for investment promotion purposes.
The hotel and motion picture industries, public transportation, the University
of the West Indies and most direct government imports also benefit from duty



- 20 -
exemption. Another major source of exemption is the 'Group of 77", a list of 77
different categories under which goods can be imported duty free and which
benefit a large variety of public and private institutions and sectors.
Finally, imports of the enterprises In the KFZ and of the firms manufacturing
under the assembly provisions of the US tariff code are duty free. In 1986,
excluding the Imports which benefit from justified duty exemption (imports of
the bauxite industry, oil, CARICOM imports, imported Inputs of the assembly
industry), about US$300 million, corresponding to 50% of the remaining imports,
were exempted from duty payment. About 402 of this Import value wa exempted
under the "Group of 77" regulations; 35% benefitted from exemption due to
Ministerial remission; 20% were imports under the incentives acts; and about 5%
had a statutory zero tariff under the CET.
51.      Although import licensing was abolished in principle in April 1985,
about 80 items of the Jamaican Customs Code remained on a restricted import
list, including basic foods products, pharmaceuticals, fertilizers, explosives,
plywood, motor vehicles and parts, and arms and ammunition. Subsequently, a
number of items, mainly processed fruits and vegetables which generally have low
import duties, were placed again on the restricted list after a surge in imports
of these items. Finally, reference prices, together with high additional stamp
duties, provide protection for major food and steel products. Reference prices,
together with the additional stamp duty, involve an increase of the protection
level of the affected products, since they tend to be set at levels
substantially above the actual CIF prices. The total duty charge, which is
calculated as a percentage of the high reference price, may reach up to 300% of
the CIF price, effectively preventing Importation.
52.       All-in-all the system of tariffs, stamp duties and exemptions,
combined with the remaining non-tariff restrictions, is inconsistent, complex
and inefficient. It provides wrong signals to the enterprises, is difficult to
administer and costly to the economy. A recent study2/ by consultants of the
government concluded that the net result of the current protection system is to
afford high protection to domestic market production and low protection to
production for the export market. Disparities of effective protection rates for
different product categories are high: Industries with good export performance
(food processing, beverages, tobacco products and apparel) receive fairly
low effective protection, while several industries producing for the domestic
market (rubber products, part of the chemical industry, plastics, metal products
and electrical products) are highly protected. The footwear industry is the
only major import substitution activity which has developed with almost no
protection. For the purpose of obtaining a measure of industrial efficiency,
the consultants' report also estimated the domestic resources that must be spent
in different industries to earn or save a dollar of foreign exchange. The
2/ Center for Development Technology, Inc.: Comparative Advantage and
Incentive Stady, February 1986.



- 21 -
results of this analysis are consistent with the estimation of effective
protection rates: food, footwear, apparel, chemicals and metals are produced
efficiently in Jamaica and generate or save more foreign exchange than they use
in production, while paper, plastics, electrical equipment and machinery
Industries seem to be largely lnefflcient and are net users of foreign exchange.
Trade Reform Program
53.       In light of the distortions and inefficiencies discussed above, the
Government has greatly stepped up Its efforts to reform the trade regime. Its
new program encompasses the following: simplification of the duty system and
its administration; substantial reduction of the differentials in the duty rates
aiming at a small number of rates varying between 5% and 30%; broadening of the
product base which is subject to duty payment by eliminating all major duty
exemption schemes; and introduction of a drawback system for export
manufacturers to enable them to obtain production inputs at world prices. On
the administrative side, the Government has established a Tariff Reform
Committee with the task of designing the implementation details of the reform
program and monitoring its execution. An Anti-dumping Committee which would
operate an import safeguard mechanism would be created under the Ministry of
Foreign Affairs, Trade and Industry to provide assistance, in appropriate cases,
to Jamaican firms exposed to dumping.
54.       The final goals of the tariff reform would be achieved in several
stages over four years beginning January 1987. A gradual implementation of the
reform program is necessary for several reasons: First, an immediate and
radical change of level and structure of protection would lead to severe
economic disruption and substantial losses of jobs and production at a time when
the economy is still fragile. Second, drastic changes of the tariff system
could lead to unforeseen reductions in duty collections, while under a phased
program the Government can adjust the rates of the general consumption tax to
compensate for any losses in duty collection which may arise in the later phases
of the reform. Third, the Government Is also committed to the international
agreement on the CET. Negotiations with the CARICOM partners on a revision of
the CET in line with the tariff reform goals will be time consuming. The final
tariff structure of the reform program can only be implemented after a
successful completion of these negotiations, but the initial phase of the
reform, which is supported by the proposed loan, can be put into effect under
the existing CARICOM agreement.
55.       The major Impact of the tariff reform program would be upon the
dispersion of protection, while the overall level of effective protection would
only change by a small amount. Average effective protection of domestic market
production is currently estimated at a moderate 44%. However, effective
protection varies widely from negative rates for the footwear and leather
industry to high rates of 220% for the plastics and rubber products industries.
At the completion of the tariff reform the average effective protection would



- 22 -
be about 35% - 40%. The majority of the enterprises would be protected at
effective rates of 202 to 30% and only a small number of consumer goods
manufacturers would benefit from high effective protection of over 50X. The
progressive reduction in the dispersion of ecfective protection rates during the
tariff reform would support economic growth by increasing incentives for those
activities in which Jamaica has a comparative advantage.
56.       A Cabinet Paper submitted to Parliament in February 1987 contains a
broad outline of the comqlete tariff reform program. It establishes ultimate
goals including a final set of four tariff rates to be achieved by March 1991:
10% for raw materials, 20% for capital goods and 30% for consumer goods; only
items imported by public utility companies would pay a reduced duty rate of 52.
It also lists the exemptions to import duties that will continue to be applied.
Finally, it spells out the detailed measures which will be put into effect as
the first stage of the reform program. The public discussion of the Cabinet
Paper has provided enterprises and consumers in Jamaica with the necessary
information for making timely adjustments in anticipation of the changing
incentive system. The Development Policy Statement and Action Program presented
In Annex II contain the substance of the Government's Cabinet Paper.
57.       The first phase of the new program is already underway and has three
main objectives: First, to provide a clear signal to enterprises and consumers
that the Government intends to embark on a broad-based tariff reform. Second,
to indicate the direction of the reform process, so that firms and consumers can
take effective steps for adjusting to the following reform stages. Third, to
achieve a substantial improvement in the tariff system, while avoiding economic
disruption to the extent possible. The specific measures which the Government
is implementing under the proposed loan during the initial stage of the tariff
reform are described below.
Tariffs
58.       During the initial stage of the reform, the dispersion of nominal
import tariff and stamp duty rates, ranging from zero to over 200%, would be
substantially reduced by eliminating tariff peaks and introducing a minimum
tariff for items presently with a statutory zero CET and stamp duty. To this
end, the Government introduced, In March 1987, a maximum total CET and stamp
duty rate of 68%. Before second tranche release, (i) this maximum tariff rate
would be reduced to 60%, and (ii) its further reduction during the following
twelve-month period (FY1988/89) would be agreed with the Bank. A limited number
of items (items defined as luxury products and several agricultural products
protected by high stamp duties) would temporarily carry a higher tariff than the
maximum.



- 23 -
59.       Import duties will also be imposed on items carrying a zero nominal
tariff and stamp duty. Prior to second tranche release, a tariff of 5% would be
introduced for animal feed, fertilizer, printed material and agricultural
tools.  The most significant items entltled to duty-free importation are basic
foods and prescription drugs. Mainly because of their social Impact, these
would become subject to a minimum tariff in the following stages of the reform.
Upon completion of the initial stage of the program (March 1988) Imports of
about J$ 7 million out of total Imports at zero tariff of about J$ 73 million
would be affected by the introduction of the minimum tariff.
Tarlff Exemptions
60.       The initial stage of the reform program includes important actions
with respect to each of the major categories of exemptions, i.e., the Industrial
Incentives Act and other incentive legislation, Ministerial remissions and the
Group of 77. The bulk of these actions has already been taken, including the
Imposition of a 51 duty on imports by the public utility companies which came
into effect on February 4, 1987. Except as noted below, exemptions under the
various Incentive acts were abolished as of January 19, 1987. This will not
immediately affect the benefitting enterprises since they would continue their
duty-free importations until the stated expiration of thelr benefits. The
remval of these schemes will send a clear signal, however, to the import
substitution industry that, in the future, it will not receive any preferential
tariff treatment. On the other hand, enterprises exporting 1002 of production
to markets outside of CARICOM will continue to be entitled to duty-free imports
of production Inputs and machinery under the Export Industry Encouragement Act
or will be compensated for their payment of duties and indirect taxes under the
rebate scheme (para. 66). Ministerial remission was also abolished as of
January 19, 1987, except for a small number of exceptional circumstances, i.e.,
natural disaster; charitable programs; emergency situations; gifts to Government
health and welfare programs; and International agreements.
61.       On March 31, 1987, the Government removed 50 of the 'Group of 77"
categories entitled to duty-free importation. These 50 categories covered 391
of total Import value of the 77 in 1985 (excluding imports of oil, aircraft
supplies and a power barge). Before second tranche release, additional
categories, with an import value of at least 111 would be removed from exempt
status, in order to bring the total reduction of exemptions to at least 501 of
the total 1985 import value of the 77. The categories to be removed during the
succeeding phase of the tariff reform would also be agreed with the Bank prior
to second tranche release. A small number of entitlements to exemption from
duties for legal reasons (mainly items imported for international conventions)
and sr2ial reasons (e.g., for charitable institutions and churches) would not be
removed under the program. These amounted to only about 1X of 1985 import value
of the 77.



- 24 -
Non-tariff Import Restrictions
62.        mport Licensig.  At the end of 1986 import licenses were required
for four categories of products: (i) items for which the Jamaican Commodity
Trading Corporation (JCTC) has an import monopoly (mainly basic foods,
fertilizer, pharmaceuticals, automobiles); (ii) agricultural and agro-industrial
products (processed vegetables and fruits); (iii) a small number of industrial
products (several wood products, matches, chassis for trucks and tractors); and
(iv) items under Government import control for security and public health
reasons.
63.       Under the reform program, the Government intends to abolish the
restricted list, except for national security and public health items and a few
agricultural items produced by small farmers who will require import protection
beyond the period of the program . Also JCTC imports of (t) items consumed by
the low income population and (ii) automobiles are likely to be dealt with only
in the later years of the program. The first steps under the program were taken
on February 25, 1987, when the government removed 55 items from the restricted
list. Such items included most of the products which had been replaced on the
list after April 1985; agricultural products produced competitively in Jamaica;
a number of fertilizer products which were previously under the import monopoly
of JCTC, but where direct importation by traders and farmers is considered more
effective; and a number of industrial products, for which the JCTC monopoly was
abolished. An additional 45 agricultural items were moved from the restricted
Import list at the same time and placed on the list of items subject to
reference prices. As a result of these actions, the list of restricted items
has been cut by approximately 50%, with the majority of the 112 items remaining
on the list falling outside the scope of the program. The Tariff Reform
Committee will examine the remaining restricted items and identify, in agreement
with the Bank, further items which would be removed prior to second tranche
release.
64.       Reference Prices.  The system of reference prices, jointly with an
additional stamp duty of generally 40% and 95%, protects agriculture, the
poultry and beef lndustry, the milling industry, and the steel industry. Only
small farmers require additional long-run protection by the system of reference
prices and protective stamp duties, while large agriculture, which is frequently
producing for export, and industries can be removed over time from the system,
as they would be adequately protected by regular tariffs and the anti-dumping
provision which has been put into effect by the Government. On February 25,
1987, the Government took the first step in dismantling the system of reference
prices and protective stamp duties. All fruits and vegetables which are
generally produced efficiently in Jamaica were completely removed from the list
of items with protective stamp duties. In addition, eight other agricultural
products were removed from the system of reference prices while maintaining
their protective stamp duties. The Tariff Reform Committee will examine the
list of items which remain subject to reference prices and additional stamp
duties and determine, in agreement with the Bank, additional items to be removed
from the system prior to second tranche release.



- 25 -
65.       During the program phase supported by the proposed loan, manufacturing
production protected by non-tariff barriers (import licensing and reference
prices), which was already reduced to a low level under the SAL programs, would
decline further, from about 11% to 8% of total manufacturing production;
agricultural production protected by non-trade barriers would decline from about
20% to 15% of total agricultural production. Overall, the coverage of
non-tariff protection would decline by second tranche release from 8.5% of total
goods production in Jamaica to 6.2%.
Duty Rebate Scheme
66.       When raising the stamp duty rates on imports in April 1985, the
Government implemented a duty drawback scheme for export manufacturers.
However, this scheme never became fully operational, partly because the system
did not take into account the duty component of domestically produced inputs and
domestic indirect taxation. Furthermore, exporters were reimbursed for their
duties on the imported inputs only at the time of exportation of the finished
product, which made the scheme uncompetitive with the provision of import duty
exemption under the Export Industry Encouragement Act and the system of
Ministerial remissions. Given the recent discontinuation of Ministerial
remissions, a more effective duty rebate system would be required to maintain
the competitiveness of Jamaican export manufacturers. As the first step toward
this end, the Government has put into operation a temporary scheme providing for
a premium of 7.5% of export value for exports of manufactured goods to
non-CARICOM countries. This temporary scheme aims at compensating exporters for
the appreciation of the real exchange rate since November 1985 and forms an
integral part of the present IMF Stand-by arrangement. The Government is,
however, committed to replacing this temporary scheme with a rebate system which
would reimburse exporters for the import duties and indirect taxes actually
paid. The Government has recently prepared an outline of such a scheme and the
revised duty rebate scheme, after prior approval by the Bank, would be put into
operation before second tranche release.
Institutional Framework
67.       The tariff reform requires the detailed preparation of program phases,
continuous monitoring of their impact and the identification of support programs
that might be necessary to ease transition problems faced by individual firms
and sectors. The Government's Tariff Reform Committee which is staffed with
members from the relevant Government agencies will perform such functions. The
terms of reference providing the different functions and operational procedures
of the Tariff Reform Committee have been agreed with the Bank. The Committee
initiated its operations in May 1987. Its tariff reform program covering the
period April 1988 to March 1989, as agreed by the Government and satisfactory to
the Bank, will be published prior to second tranche release.
68.       The Government established in May 1987 an Anti-dumping Committee under
the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Trade and Industry to provide temporary
assistance, in appropriate cases, to firms facing dumping of their products.



- 26 -
This Comittee includes representatives of relevant interest groups. The
anti-dumping regulations, together with the operational procedures for the
Committee have been dlscussed with the Government. The Government wll1 submit
the relevant legislation to Parliament by October 1987.
69.       The Tariff Reform Committee and the Anti-dumping Committee are
expected to require outside technical assistance in performing their important
and complex functions. An outline of the the terms of reference of such
assistance has been agreed with the Government. The assistance would be
financed from funds of the Second Technical Assistance Loan (Loan No. 2507-JM,
signed September 16, 1985).
70.       The full tariff reform program cannot be completed while the current
agreement on the CET continues to be in effect. The Government intends,
therefore, to initiate at an early time negotiations with the CARICOM member
countries on revising the CET to make it consistent with the reform program.
The Government plans to formally present its program for CRT revision to the
next meeting of CARICOM Heads of Government.
Financial Sector Reform
Current Structure and Recent Developments
71.       The Bank of Jamaica (BOJ) is the monetary authority of the country.
It issues currency, holds the country's international reserves, provides
financial services to banks and the government, and regulates the banking
system. Jamaica's monetary policy is managed by the BOJ in conjunction with the
Ministry of Finance, The main policy instrument employed by BOJ is the liquid
asset reserve which is composed of the cash and asset reserve requirement.
Commercial banks, merchant banks and trust companies have to maintain a cash
reserve in proportion to their deposits. Furthermore, these institutions have
to hold a BOJ-stipulated volume of assets, mostly consisting of treasury bills
and government bonds. Since 1984, the BOJ has used the discount rate for
indicating the direction of monetary policy changes. More recently, the DOJ has
also entered the money market by issuing its own certificate of deposit (CD).
The BQJ has not intervened directly in the allocation of credlt to the private
sector, with the exception of ceilings on credit growth which were Imposed
intermittently but were removed in October 1985.
72.       Commercial banks dominate the financial system and accounted for about
two thirds of the assets held by financial institutions during 1986. The 10
commercial banks also own 4 out of 8 merchant banks and 6 out of 10 trust
companies. Merchant banks and trust companies are chartered to lntermediate in
medium- and long-term financial instruments and to perform financial trust
operations* In practice, however, they are frequently used to attract time
deposits which they can do at lower cost than commercial banks due to reserve
ratio differentials among financial intermediaries. Life insurance companies



- 27 -
are second to commercial banks in terms of total assets. They invest mainly in
government bonds and mortgage loans. Building societies and credit unions also
play important roles in Jamaica's financial sector, althoiugh their assets are
only about 10X of total financial sector assets.
73.       The small Jamaica Stock Exchange is Incorporated as a private company,
but operates in practice as a subsidiary of the Bank of Jamaica (BOJ) which pays
part of its overhead expenses and accommodates the trading floor and the
administrative office in its building. Only four brokers hold the voting
shares, while the shares issued to the BOJ for covering past operational
deficits of the stock exchange are non-voting. Currently, 52 companies are
listed on the stock exchange and only one new company has been listed since
1973. About 90 million shares with a value of about J$500 million were traded
in 1986.
74.       During the ten-year period ending in 1982, the financial sector
maintained a steady rate of resource mobilization (M2 fluctuated in a narrow
range around 38% of GDP).  Financial deepening resumed thereafter with M2
attaining 42.22 of GDP in 1985, one of the highest ratios among countries of
comparable income per capita. This performance contrasts sharply with the
overall decline of the Jamaican economy during the 19709 and the moderate
economic growth of the 1980s. Several factors contributed to the strength of
the financial sector in an adverse environment of economic recession and low
growth: (i) a growing network of financial institutions; (ii) a fair degree of
competition among financial intermediaries in resource mobilization; (iII) the
traditionally high saving propensity of the Jamaican population; and (iv) the
predominantly market-determined, flexible interest rates.
Financial Sector Policies and Interest Rates
75.       Efficient mobilization of resources has enabled total domestic credit
to expand at annual rates which were generally above inflation. The good growth
of domestic credit in the 1970. and 1980s, however, masked the fact that an
underlying change in credit allocation was taking place. Most of the additional
credit created during the 1970s and 19809 went to the public sector which
accounted for over 502 of the total net domestic credit outstanding in 1986,
compared to only 11% in 1970.
76.       Interest rates are largely determined by market forces, with the
exception of two administered rates. The BOJ fixes the "bank rate" which it
charges on the Government's overdraft account. There is also a floor interest
rate on savings deposits for protecting the small savers, which has frequently
been used to influence interest rate levels. The ceiling on mortgage rates was
abolished in 1985. The interest rates on the BOJ's certificates of deposit and
on treasury bills are market determined, although the requirement on financial
institutions to hold treasury bills as part of their liquidity reserve has
depressed treasury bill rates relative to the level of interest on certificates



- 28 -
of deposit. After a period of depressed interest rates on commercial bank loans
duriA3 the late 1970s, credit rates have been strongly positive in real terms
(with the exception of 1984, when inflation increased rapidly).
Financial Sector Issues and Reform Program
77.       Financial institutions in Jamaica are generally privately owned and
financial markets suffer from little direct Government intervention. Overall,
the financial system tends to mobilize and allocate financial resources
efficiently. However, the heavy and protracted recourse to the financial system
by the public sector in the 1970s and the 1980s caused a number of distortions
that adversely affected financial intermediation. In this period, the rapid
expansion of public demand for financial resources contributed to raising the
lending rates of commercial banks which may have resulted in crowding out
private enterprises on credit markets. The monetary policy of the BOJ was
increasingly determined by the need to raise resources for the public sector,
whose overall deficit expanded from 2.3% of GDP in 1972 to 12%-19% of GDP
between 1976 and 1985. About half of these deficits were financed through the
banking sector, including the BOJ, whose net claims on the government rose from
J$ 43 million (32 of GDP) in 1972 to over J$ 3.0 billion (30% of GDP) in 1986.
The financing of the large public sector deficits through the BOJ created a
number of economic policy issues including: (i) distortions in credit allocation
and interest rate structure; (ii) an entanglement of monetary and fiscal
policies and instruments; and (iii) constraints upon the development of the
capital market.
78.       With the support of Bank staff during loan preparation, the Government
conducted an analysis of financial policies and approved, in March 1986,
revisions aiming at: (i) the removal of the remaining distortions in financial
markets listed in para. 77; (ii) the separation of monetary and fiscal policies;
and (iII) the creation of a fiscal and institutional environment which would
strengthen the capital markets. Towards these ends, the Cabinet approved, in
March 1986, a revision of the banking legislation including the Banking Act for
the comercial banks, the Financial Institutions Act for financial institutions
other than the commercial banks, and the Bank of Jamaica Act regulating the
BQJ's new financial policy and its strengthened supervisory functions.
79.       While the proposed new legislation has not yet been presented to
Parliament, the Government and the BOJ have already implemented, with the
continued support of Bank staff and Bank-financed technical assistance,
important measures required by the revised financial laws, The revised
legislation will be submitted to Parliament by December 1987. The proposed loan
would support the effective completion of the Government's financial sector
reform program, except mainly for the securities market reform which requires an
in-depth study and fundamental organizational changes. The study is scheduled
for completion prior to second tranche release.



- 29 -
Removing Distortions in Financial Markets
80.       Reserve Requirements   In accordance with the financial sector reform
program, the Government has given the BOJ a higher degree of operational
independence to manage financial policies. The BQJ's policies will focus on the
coetrol of base money in the economy, which entails reliance upon three main
instruments: reserve requirements for banks; open-market operations of the BOJ;
and rediscounting activities of the Bo. Most of the broad provisions for these
instruments were made effective under the Government program approved in March
1986. At about the same time, the BOJ made the necessary organizational
arrangements and initiated, with the support of Bank staff, the establishment of
the analytical capability for formulating monetary policy and monitoring its
impact.
81.       Under the restrictive monetary pollcy environment In 1984 and 1985,
the BOJ relied heavily upon the liquid asset reserve requirement. Given that
this requirement is fulfilled mainly with the purchase of Government paper, the
BOJ has used it for both controlling credit expansion and for financing the
public sector deficit.  This dual function has had an adverse effect on monetary
policy as the BJ has generally been required to subordinate monetary policy to
the Government's need for fiscal resources. Furthermore, the inclusion of
Government paper in the liquid asset requirement tends to distort the interest
rate structure as Treasury bills generally carry interest below market rates.
Financial Institutions offset the foregone revenue on Government paper by
charging correspondingly higher Interest rates on loans 'to the private sector,
which end up subsidizing the Government's debt. The highly positive real rates
of commercial banks' lending to the private sector Indicate that such
subsidization has occurred in recent years.
82.       The BOJ has already initiated the reduction of the liquid asset
requirement imposed on financial Institutions. Since February 1986, the liquid
asset ratio has been reduced in three steps from 481 to 35%. The required
non-cash portion of the ratio has declined from 281 to 151, leaving the cash
reserve requirement unchanged at 20% of prescribed liabilities. These measures
havp provided additional liquidity to the banking system. Furthermore, the
smaller amounts of relatively low yielding treasury bills in the liquid asset
requirement have enabled the banks to reduce the interest rate charges on
private sector loans.
83.       The proposed loan would support a continued shift toward base money
management* The Government has recently decided to eliminate completely the
non-cash portion of the liquid asset ratio by March 31, 1988. Thereafter,
financial institutions would no longer be forced to purchase Government paper,
and the BOJ would rely on cash reserves, at levels set in accordance with the
requirements of monetary policy. Thus, the new policy on reserve requirements
would be fully In effect prior to second tranche release.



- 30 -
84.       Open Market Operations.  In November 1985, the BJ initiated the
issuance of certificates of deposit (CD) with the intention to absorb liquidity
in the economy in support of the tight monetary and credit policies. The CDs
are the BOJ's main instrument of an actlve open market policy which serves, in
addition to the cash reserves, to fine-tune monetary policy. CD interest rates
declined between March and December 1986 from about 28% to 18% in line with the
substantlal reductions In deposit rates during this period. The BJ's open
market operations under the new monetary policy are, therefore, off to a good
start, although a secondary market for CDs has not yet been established.
85.       Rediscounting Operations. The third instrument of the new monetary
policy, rediscounting operations by the BOJ, was formally reinstated in may 1986
with a discount rate of 152. However, due to the current high liquidity of the
banking system, which has been strengthened by the reduction of the liquid asset
reserve requirement, the discount window of the BOJ is not yet operating.
Furthermore, the BOJ imposed a penalty of 10% above the discount rate for
treasury bills, in order to discourage a possible large-scale redemption of
Government paper which had been released from the liquid asset ratio. However,
once the need for providing additional liquidity to fimancial institutions on a
selective basis arises, the discount window is expected to perform an important
function In situations where the integrity of segments of the financial system
is threatened.
86.       Payment of Interest on Bank Reserves.  The required holding of
interest free reserves with the B0J represented a considerable cost burden for
the banks. It induced the banks to maintain high spreads between deposit and
loan rates thereby reducing the effectiveness of financial intermediation in
Jamaica. Therefore, the Government recently approved the payment of interest on
part of the cash reserves held with the B0J. Three percentage points of the 20%
cash reserve currently receive an interest payment at market rates. The B1J
would extend the payment of interest to six percentage points (corresponding to
30% of total prescribed cash reserves) before second tranche release. The level
of Interest paid on such reserves by the B1W would continue to be In line with
market interest rates.
87.       Overdraft Facility.  The B0J manages several Government accounts,
including an overdraft facility, that initially were meant to level out seasonal
fluctuations In the Government's cashflow. Beginning in 1976, the Government
was permitted to automatically draw up to 30% of the year's projected fiscal
revenue under the overdraft facility. The extensive use of the account had two
adverse effects. First, it has resulted in excessive money creation, which led
to inflation and loss of foreign exchange reserves. Second, it led to a sharp
Increase in domestic debt, since, at the end of the fiscal year, the Ministry of
Finance usually repaid the remaining balance with long-term bonds . The
overdraft account, thus, became entrenched as a permanent method of financing
the public sector deficit. The Government has recognized the adverse effects on



- 31 -
the economy of this method of financing public sector operations and is
gradually reducing the overdraft celling. In March 1986, the ceiling was
lowered to 152 of the Government's projected annual revenues. The Issue of
public sector financing by the B0J is being addressed In the IMF Stand-by
agreaent which establishes public sector deficit and net domestic assets limits
of the BQJ.
Control of Financial Sector Policies and Supervision of Financial Institutions
88.       The broad based financial sector reform program Initiated by the
Government and continued under the proposed operation will require a careful and
continuous assessment of the response of the financial markets.  To achieve this
the BOJ has established a Monetary Policy Committee composed of the senior bank
management with appropriate technical subcommittees. The Bank has been working
with the B0J toward strengthening of the control mechanisms at the disposal of
the Committee and sponsored, under the Second Technical Assistance Loan (Loan
No. 2507-3M, signed September 16, 1985), the formulation of two models, one for
money demand/supply projections and one for estimating flow of funds. Both
models are expected to become operational toward the end of 1987.
89.       The flow of information to the Monetary Policy Committee and its
pollcy making subcommittee is not yet functioning in a satiseactory mrnner. The
current methods of collecting and processing information in the BOJ is
cumbersome and senior management of the B0o is generally not provided with
reliable and timely information needed for effective decision-making. Technical
assistance for the establishment of processing capabilities for
balance-of-payment and financial system data, including data processing hardware
and software together with the related training of Do0 staff, would be provided
with financing under the Second Technical Assistance loan. The data collection
and processing facilities will be operational by December 1987.
90.       The financial reform program is expected to broaden the scope of the
functions of financial intermediaries and to help develop the capital market.
The reform would create an environment in which financial institutions will be
more dynamic, take more risks and grow in number. The recent establishment of
two new cov_ercial banks and several merchant banks and investment funds provide
evidence that such developments are already occurring. In thls more liberal
environment, the importance of effective bank supervision is heightened. The
revised banking legislation approved by the Cabinet in March 1986 provides the
legal framework for broadened supervisory power of the BOJ. Pending enactment
of this legislation, the 10., with the assistance of the IMP, has taken
effective measures to reinforce Its supervisory capabilities. The banking
Inspection department of the BO0, which will carry out the broadened supervisory
function, is changing procedures, increasing staff and conducting a thorough
staff training program. These measures are adequate to meet the expanded



- 32 -
supervision requirements of the BOJ, and no additional external assistance is
needed in this area.
Strengthening of Financial Markets
91.       Taxation of Financial Instruments.  Successful implementation of the
new financial policies is conditioned upon a better functioning of the capital
market. By curtailing the Government's recourse to the BOJ's overdraft facility
and concomittantly phasing out the banks' compulsory investments in Government
paper, the Government will be directed toward the money and capital markets for
its financing requirements. Absorption by the capital market of the
Government's debt instruments will be an important determinant of success of the
new financial policy. Furthermore, Jamaica's capital market has the potential
to play a more important and dynamic role in the country's economic
development. Currently, Jamaican companies are highly leveraged and in need of
more equity which the financial markets are so far unable to provide. Finally,
efficient functioning of the capital market will facilitate the success of the
divestiture of public enterprises which is currently under implementation.
92.       The fiscal system has been biased against equity Investment in favor
of debt and has bo:h encouraged companies to use credit rather than equity and
discouraged individuals from making equity investments. This has contributed to
the high debt-to-equity ratios which premail for most companies in Jamaica
today. During past high inflation and restrictive credit policies, the
enterprises were, therefore, frequently unable to finance the investments
necessary for taking advantage of new opportunities on export and domestic
markets. In the past, the anti-equity bias of the Jamaican tax system had three
main sources: (i) the corporate tax rate was high at 45%; corporate taxation
was a particular burden for the enterprises quoted on the stock exchange, which
tend to be more carefully scrutinized by the tax authorities than other firms;
(ii) corporate dividends were taxed twice: once at the corporate level, and
once at the shareholder level through a withholding tax on dividend payments of
33-1/3%; and (iii) a stamp tax was imposed on stock exchange transactions and on
the issuance of new shares. Since early 1986, a broad-based tax reform program
is being implemented in stages which, among other, aims at the reduction of the
anti-equity bias in the tax system. As a first measure for providing a more
equal tax treatment of debt and equity financing instruments, the Government
introduced, in January 1986, a 33-1/3% withholding tax on interest payments.
Furthermore, at the beginning of 1987, the Government reduced the rate of
corporate taxation also to 33-1/3% and eliminated the tax on stock exchange
transactions.
93.       In spite of the recent measures on taxation, there continues to be
anti-equity bias in the Jamaican tax system. In the context of the on-going tax
reform, the Government intends to amend corporate tax regulations in a manner
which would, in principle, permit investors to avoid dividend tax by converting
dividend payments into equity. A revised regulation satisfactory to the Bank



- 33 -
would be made effective prior to second tranche release. Also, prior to second
tranebe release, the stamp duties on the issuance of new shares on the stock
market would be removed.
94.       Development of New Financial Instruments.  The Government has
recognized that it should play a greater role than in the past In stimulating
the development of the capital market. To that end, the Government intends to
increase the number of financial instruments available to institutional and
individual investors. Prior to second tranche release, the Government would
introduce at least two new debt instruments, an instrument of 180 to 360 days
maturity and a medium-term bond, with variable interest rates.
95.       Strengthening of the Stock Exchange and the Securities Market.  The
stock exchange plays only a small role in Jamaica's financial sector, in spite
of the recent expansion of the trading volume from 37 million shares In 1985 to
90 million shares in 1986. If it is to achieve a more significant capital
market function than in the past, the stock exchange requires a thorough
reorganization. The Government has recently initiated a study of Jamaica's
securities markets which calls for, inter alia, detailed proposals for the
required changes in the institutional framework and operational procedures of
the stock exchange. The study will make proposals on how the stock exchange can
operate largely independently of the BOJ, attract more shareholders than
currently, introduce over-the-counter trading to Increase the number of
listings and achieve more active trading, and improve its financial situation.
This study will be completed by December 1987, and Government proposals for
implementing its recommendations furnished to the Bank before second tranche
release.
96.       Stock market trading is currently subject to inadequate control and
supervision. As the trading volume has increased In recent times, reports on
trading irregularities have become more frequent. The capital market study
mentioned above would also make proposals on establishing an independent
authority, a Securities Exchange Commission whichs, among other functions, would
have the task of supervising stock market operations. The creation of a new
securities market agency is a long-term undertaking and the Securities Exchange
Commission may not be fully operational for several years. However, current
dynamic developments on the Jamaican stock markets require effective supervision
of the stock exchange at a much earlier time. The Government intends to
establish, as an interim arrangement, a stock market inspection unit. The
functions of the unit would be transferred to the Securities Exchange
Commission, once this new agency is operational.
97.       The terms of reference of the securities market analysis have been
agreed with the Bank. The establishment of an interim stock market inspection
unit would also require a detailed analysis of the current situation;
establishment of operational procedures, staffing and training requirements; and



- 34 -
establishment of temporary stock market regulations including disclosure and
investor protection measures; regulations to prevent insider tr8ding; and rules
for the control of broker/dealer activlties. The terms of reference for the
technical assistance required for the establishment of the temporary stock
market supervision unit and its operational procedures have been agreed with the
Bank. The assistance would be financed from the proceeds of the Second
Technical Assistance Loan. The inspection unit would be made fully operational,
after review with the Bank, prior to second tranche release.
PART VI - THE PROPOSED LOAN
Loan History
98.       As noted in paragraph 13 above, the Bank has provided three Structural
Adjustment Loans since 1982. This has led to an intensive policy dialogue
between Government and the Bank on a broad range of macroeconomic issues, and
the Bank has provided a considerable amount of import financing to Jamaica
during this period of severe economic difficulties. The progress achieved under
the three SALs was described in Part II of this report, and the proposed Sector
Adjustment Loan reinforces the reform programs undertaken under these loans. It
was initially appraised in January 1986 and reappraised in August and September,
1986. Negotiations took place in Washington in May 1987, and the Jamaican
delegation was led by Mr. Harold Milner, Financial Secretary of the Ministry of
Finance and Planning. Annex IV contains a timetable of key events in processing
the operation and a description of the special conditions of the proposed loan.
Loan Description and Administration
Loan Description
99.       The proposed loan would consist of two tranches of US$20 million
equivalent each and would finance the CIF cost of a wide variety of general
imports, including raw materials, intermediate goods, non-luxury consumer goods,
capital equipment and spare parts, subject only to a negative list of prohibited
items.
100.      The matrix in Annex III summarizes the policy actions that were taken
prior to Board presentation and those that will have to be taken prior to the
release of the second tranche. A discussion of these is contained in Part V,
and in the Government's Development Policy Statement which is included as
Annex II.
Disbursement
101.      The first tranche of the loan is expected to be disbursed soon after
loan effectiveness and the second tranche after it has been determined that the



- 35 -
policy actions that have been taken are satisfactory. Such determination is
expected to occur within ten months after loan signature. The Bank of Jamaica,
the country's Central Bank, would be responsible for the coordination and
collection of relevant documentation and preparing withdrawal applications under
the loan. Disbursements for the entire loan are expected to be completed within
twelve months of loan effectiveness.
102.      Because of the financing plan of the present Government stabilization
program, which Includes balance of payments support from other multilateral and
bilateral sources, retroactive financing to January 1, 1987 of the US$20.0
million equivalent first tranche is proposed. To simplify disbursement, only
invoices with a minimum value of US$10,000 equivalent would be eligible for
financing. Disbursements would be made against full documentation, except that
for contracts/purchase orders valued up to US$50,000 equivalent relating to
eligible imports, statements of expenditure (SOB) would be authorized. The
minimum value for SOEs submitted would be US$250,000 equivalent, for which the
detailed documentation evidencing expenditures would be retained by the Bank of
Jamaica and made available for the required audit and also inspection by the
Bank.
Procurement
103.      Both private and public sector imports would be eligible for
financing. For all purchases under US$5 million, private firms would follow
normal commercial practice and public sector importers would follow standard
Government practices, which ensure reasonable prices. All purchases exceeding
US$5 million would be through international competltive bidding, in accordance
with Bank guidelines, except for petroleum imports which would be acquired
through Jamaica's existing advantageous arrangements.
Records and Auditing
104.      The Bank of Jamaica would maintain separate records and accounts of
all transactions under the loan. All such accounts would be audited annually by
independent auditors acceptable to the Bank, and the auditor's report would be
submitted to the Bank not later than four months after the end of each Jamaican
fiscal year. Audit reports would include a separate opinion with respect to the
disbursement requests submitted to the Bank on the basis of SOEs and state
whether such requests bave been effected In accordance with the terms of the
Loan Agreement.
Monitoring
105.      The progress of the Government reforms in the trade and financial
sectors and of the measures supported by the proposed operations would be
closely monitored through regular supervislon, including continued close
cooperation with the IMP. A specific supervision miesion would review
compliance with the conditions for release of the second tranche.

Risks
106.      The success of the Government's trade and financial reform programs
faces significant risks. The outcome of the Government's macroeconomic
adjustment program and the pace of the economic recovery in Jamaica could
influence the adjustment of enterprises and consumers to the changing trade and
financial environment. The tariff changes and the removal of quantitative
Import restrictions could also lead to short-term increases of imports and a
deleterious effect on the balance of payments. Furthermore, the tariff reform
program could Increase uncertainty which could affect both domestic and foreign
investor confidence and, therefore, retard temporarily the growth of industrial
investment and production. Finally, the outcome of the trade policy reform will
depend upon the level of national support as well as the Government's
administrative capacity to carry out the adjustment programs. Some of the risks
are beyond the Government's and the country's control. The Government has,
however, demonstrated a willingness to take politically difficult economic
actions. In so doing, it has continued to enjoy national support. As a result,
the risks associated with the project are acceptable.
PART VII - RECOMMENDATION
107.      I recommend that the Executive Directors approve the proposed loan.

JAMAICA
TRADE AND FINANCIAL SECTOR
ADJUSTMENT LOAN
DEVELOPMENT POLICY STATEMENT AND ACTION PROGRAMS
1.        The Government of Jamaica requests the World Bank (IBRD) to
provide a loan of US$40 million for a sector adjustment operation in
support of the continuing process of reform of the trade regime and the
financial system within the Government's overall structural adjustment
progr&m for the Jamaican economy.
TRADE POLICY REFORM
2.        From the outset of the structural adjustment program the
Government has given high priority to improving the incentive framework for
the industrial sector. The sector suffered severely in the 1970'. and
early 1980's from a number of external events: the two oil shocks, the
decline in international demand for and the price of bauxite and alumina,
and the increasing difficulties experienced by CARICOM. These external
factors, however, were magnified by an incentive system biased against
exports. Incentive policies which, at that time, included extensive
quantitative restrictions, encouraged production for the protected domestic
and regional markets and discouraged exports to markets outside the CARICOM
area. These shortcomings impeded the recovery process and hindered the
Government's export-led growth strategy. The Government, therefore, set
out to create a climate conducive to private initiative and enterprise by
introducing programmes strengthening the market system through the
reduction of controls on prices, import licensing and state marketing.
3.        A programme for the elimination of quantitative restrictions on
imports was initiated in 1982 and by 1985 the majority of such restrictions
had been eliminated. These measures were complemented by the introduction
of a more flexible foreign exchange policy and a number of incentives to
exporters. Nevertheless there remains a need for further major adjustments
in the structure and level of import protection, and the Government
therefore proposes to embark on a new, comprehensive trade reform programs
to be implemented in a systematic and progressive manner over a four year
period ending in March 1991. The main objectives and features of the
reform and the measures to be adopted during fiscal year 1987-88 are set
out in Cabinet Papers tabled in Parliament in January and February 1987,
the substance of which is set out below.
A. Objectives and Main Features of the Four-Year Programme
4.        The present tariff regime applies to a narrow import base because
of the extent of exemptions and reductions granted. A large proportion of
Imports now enter duty free. In 1985, out of a total CIF import value of
US$776 million net of oil, only $237 million or approximately 31% was
subject to duty. Further there is a wide dispersion of duty rates between



- 42 -
ANNEX I2
Page 2 of 8
0 and 200%. Finally there still exists a substantial number of
qtuatitative and other restrictions which impede the efficient evolution of
the productive sectors. The main objectives of the programse are to
simplify the tariff system and minimize QRs. This will involve adjustments
in the aggregate of customs and stamp dutles, the elimination of most
exemptions and ministerial remissions, and the removal of all items from
the restricted import list and from the system of reference prices and
protective stamp duties, except for (a) items produced by small farmers,
who will require protection beyond the end of the programe period, (b)
items requiring government import control for security and health reasons,
and (c) basic foods and pharmaceuticals imported by JCTC.
5.        More specifically, the final set of rates to be applied by the
end of the reform period are as follows:
(i) 5% import duty to be applied on items imported by the
utility companies as described in the Second Schedule of the
Customs Tariff Code (hereafter referred to as Second
Schedule);
(ii) 0I agregate import du y to be applied to raw materials;
(iii) 20% aggregate import duty to be applied to capital goods;
(iv) 30% aggregate import duty to be applied to consumer goods.
The first reduction of the maximum aggregate rate will be to 68%, subject
to the exceptions spelled out in para 8. Further reductions will be made
annually in consultation with interest groups to reach the 301 maximum by
1991. However, the actual maximum for each of these later years will be
subject to progress in negotiations with CARIC0M. In this latter regard,
the Government is seeking revisions on an urgent basis in the CARICOM
external tariff (CET) system to make it consistent with the reform
programme.
6.        Ministerial remissions and exemptions under the Rotels
[Incentives] Act, the Industrial Incentives Act, the Pioneer Industries
[Encouragement) Law, the Export Industry Encouragement Act and under the
Second Schedule will be eliminated under the programe except for the
following cases: natural disaster, charitable programmes, gifts to the
Government, temporary imports, international agreements, oil, bauxite and
CARICOM imports, 807-type imports, bank and currency notes and coins, and
the University of the West Indies. The Export Industry Encouragement Act
will continue to entitle firms exporting to markets outside of CARICON to
duty free imports of production inputs and machinery, provided such firms
produce 1002 for export, operate under a bonded warehouse system, and use
their imported inputs and machinery exclusively for exports. Such firms
will have the option of the exemption provided by the Act or the import
duty rebate. The latter will be replaced under the programme by a rebate
scheme which wlll reimburse exporters for the import duties and indirect
taxes actually paid. The removal of most ministerial remissions and
exemptions will Increase revenues to compensate for revenue losses
resulting from the decrease of maximm rates.

Page 3 of 8
7.        A Tariff Reform Committee will be set up to monitor the impact of
the programme and to develop the specifics of the successive phases. The
detailed programmes will each cover a full fiscal year and will be
published at least three months prior to the start of the applicable year.
The Committee will also identify problems that could arise as a result of
implementing the programme as well as alternative approaches to dealing
with such problems that would minimize disruptions as implementation
proceeds. In addition, an Anti-Dumplng Committee will be established under
the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Trade and Industry to provide safeguards,
in appropriate cases, to firms alleging dumplig or other Injury from the
implementation of the reform. This Committee will include representatives
of relevant interest groups. The Government wlll be seeking support, both
financial and technical, to assist enterprises in the process of
transformation and modernisation. It will also seek technical assistance
financing for the Secretariat of the Tariff Reform Committee and the
Anti-Dumping Committee.
B. Initial Actions
8.        The first phase of the reform programe is already underway and
consists of the following main actions:
(i) The application of a maximum duty of 52 on items imported by
the utility companies described in the Second Schedule came
into effect February 4, 1987;
(iI) Raw material imports, which attracted a 16% stamp duty,
attract a 10% stamp duty as of January 19, 1987;
(iii) A 68% maximum aggregate of customs and stamp duties has been
applied to imports. This came into effect February 25,
1987.
Imported items which do not qualify for this new duty
treatment are:
(a) Items where the CET exceeds the 682 maximum.
(b) Items which now attract protective stamp duty, that is,
those items not removed (under the first phase) from
the list covered by the Provisional Collection of Tax
(Additional Stamp Duty) Order which attract stamp
duties of 40% and over.
(c) Imports of alcoholic beverages, tobacco products, arms
and ammunition, and motor cars with engine capacity
exceeding 2000 cc (petrol engine) and 2200 cc (diesel
engine).
(iv)  As of January 19, 1987, no new duty exemptions will be
granted under the following legislation except for cases
listed under paragraph 6 above: Hotels tIncentives] Act,
Industrial Incentives Act, Pioneer Industries
[Encouragementi Law. The Export Industry Encouragement Act



- 44 -
ANNEX It
Page 4 of 8
will be amended, if necessary, to make It conform to the
programme (para 6 above).
(v)  As of January 19, 1987 no new Ministerial remissions, other
than those referred to In para 6 above, are being granted.
(vi) As of February 4, 19X7, fifty of the seventy-seven Items
presently listed under the Second Schedule are no longer
totally exempt from customs duty. These items, which
represented 39X of the value of 1985 Imports under the
Second Schedule (excluding oil Imports, alrcraft and a power
barge), are set out In Appendix 1. In those cases where the
Items already attract stamp duty they will continue to do
so.
(vii) The outline of a duty rebate system entltling exporters to
reimbursement for Import duties and lndlrect taxes actually
paid has been prepared in May 1987. This outline is In
Appendix 7.
(viii) The Tariff Reform Committee and the Anti-Dumping Committee
have been established. Terms of reference for both
Committees have been approved by the Government and a
coordinator for the Tarlff Reform Committee has been
appointed.
(ix) By February 25, 1987 the items listed in Appendix 2 were
removed from the list of restricted lmports, and In the case
of the agricultural products Indicated in Appendix 3, these
maintain a measure of protection through reference prices
and stamp duties. The items remaining on the restricted
list during the first phase of the reform are in Appendix 4.
(z)  The system of reference prices and protective stamp duties
were removed from the items listed In Appendix 5 on
February 25, 1987.
9.        The measures implemented in this first phase of the reform
prograime enable an increase from 31X to 392 in the value of non-oil
imports which will be subject to Import duties. There Is a net tax take
estimated at J$32 million resulting from the above measures, Including the
reduction of the maximum aggregate tax to 682, lowering the present 162
stamp duty on raw materials to 102 and the removal of exemptions and
remissions.
C. Actions During Second Phase
10.       The second phase of the programme will cover the period April
1987 to March 1988 and will consist of the following main actions:
(1)  The maximum aggregate customs and stamp duties applied to
Imports will be further reduced to not more than 60 percent
by March 31, 1988, except for those Items where the maximum
CET is higher than 602 and those Items listed in para 8
(iti) (b) and (c) above.



- 45-                     A X1f8
(li) A minimum import tariff of 52 will be introduced on certain
items by March 31, 1988. These Items are set out in
Appendix 6.
(iii) Additional items enjoying duty free importation will be
removed from the Second Schedule (List of 77) by March 31,
1988. These Items will amount to at least 112 of the 1985
Import value of the Second Schedule, excluding oil imports,
aircraft and a power barge.
(Iv) All those items remaining on the lists of imports subject to
licensing and reference prices/protective stamp duties, witb
the exception of those of a security nature, small farmer
agricultural items and those subject to importation by the
Jamaica Commodity Trading Company, will be examined by the
Tariff Reform Committee with a view to further removals by
March 31, 1988. Agreement on the ltems to be removed will
be sought by November 30, 1987.
(v) The Tariff Reform Committee will design a comprehensive
Import duty rebate scheme for all exporters, except those
operating under the Jamaica Export Free Zone Act, the 807
Schedule, the Export Industry Encouragement Act, (except
where the operator exercises the option to retain duty
relief Instead of the rebate), those exporting to CARICOM
and the Bauxite sector, for consideration by the Government
by January 1988.
(vi) Draft legislation needed to make the Anti-Dumping Committee
fully operational will be tabled in Parliament by October,
1987.
(vii) The Government will seek to have the need to revise the
CARICOM CET placed on the agenda of the next CARICOM Heads
of Government Neeting.
(viii) The Government will prepare and publish the programme for
the third phase of the trade policy reform covering the
period April 1988 to March 1989. Agreement on the third
phase programme will be sought by January 31, 1988. The
programme will include the further reduction of the maximum
aggregate CET and stamp duties; further elimination of Items
from the Second Schedule; further elimination of items from
the lists of imports subject to licensing and reference
prices/protective stamp duties; reduction in the number of
Items excepted from the maxisum aggregate CRT and stamp
duties; and further increase of the number of items subject
to the minimum tariff.
FINANCIAL SECTOR REFORM
11.       The economic adjustment programse underway has as Its paramount
^bjective the achievement of stable, sustainable growth within the
constraints Imposed by the need to mintain a balance of payments situation



- 46 -                  ANNEX II
- -Page 6 of 8
sustainable in the medium to long term. The adjustment programe entails a
transitlon from a situation where public sector deficits were large,
requiring an expansionary monetary stance with consequential effects on the
balance of payments given the then fixed exchange rate regime   The
persistent entanglement of monetary and fiscal policies has advereely
affected the ability of the Bank of Jamaica (BOJ) to pursue its principal
role of maaglng money and credit in line with the requirements of the
adjustmant program. The mixing of policies has distorted both credit
allocation and the interest rate structure by pushing up rates on loans to
the private sector in order to compensate low interest funding to the
Governmeat. This has contributed to a retardation of the development of an
active and broad based capital market as well as imposing a quantitative
restraint on private sector credit availability. In order to address
these and other defielencies in financial policies the Government, in April
1986, announced a broad financial reform progamme. The main objectives of
the programe are to:
(1) separate monetary and fiscal policies;
(2) eliminate distortions in financial markets; and
(3) create a fiscal and institutional environment which would
strengthen the capital markets.
12.       Major progress has already occurred In the impleuentatioi, of the
reform progame.
A.        Liquid-Assets Ratio
13.       A major component of the reform programme is to phase out the
non-csRh portion of the liquid assets ratio. Our original (April 1986)
objective was to eliminate the non-cash portion by March 1989. We have
recently decided to accelerate this timetable so that the non-cash portion
Is eliminated by March 1988. In the meantime we have reduced the non-cash
portion in two steps from 28Z to 18S in January 1987 and further to 152 In
March 1987.
B.        Cash Reserve Interest Payment
14.       In order to help assure that reserve requirements do not result
In excessive cost burden to financial institutions which in turn could
contribute to excessively high lending rates, the Government has introduced
a policy of paying market interest rates on a portion of reserve
requirements. As a first step, market interest rates are being paid on 152
of the 201 cash reserve. By March 1988 this figure will be doubled, i.e.,
to 301 and possibly higher if compatible with the fiscal and monetary
programe for 1988/89.
C.        Base Money Management
15.       The Bank of Jamaica reintroduced in November 1985 open market
operations, through the purchase and sale of CDs in order to fine tune
monetary policy.



AM=EX 1I
-47 -                     fa7f 8
D.        Rediscounting Operations
16.      Another weakness in past policies arose from the absence of a
facllity whereby the Bank of Jamaica has the necessary leverage to
Influence the transactions of financial lastitutions at the margin. The
Bank of Jamaica, therefore, instltuted in May 1986 a rediecounting facillty
which can accommodate situations where the lntegrlty of segments of the
finanelal system Is threatened, and, more generally, situations where the
Bank of Jamaica needs selectively to influence the financial market.
E.        Monetary Policy Committee
17.       To achieve the new policy objectives the Bank of Jamaica has
established an Open Market Committee as a permanent part of the lank's
management of money and credit. The Committee has developed a money
demand/supply projection model and a flow-of-funds model which are expected
to contribute to the Commttee's decision-making process when the models
become operational towards the end of 1987.
F.        Government Overdraft Facility
18.       Central Government financing Is provided through several
instruments within the Bank of Jamaica including an overdraft facility.
The limit on use of this facility has been reduced from 301 of the expected
annual fiscal revenues to 152. The interest rate charge on this facility
Is adequate to cover the Bank of Jamaica's cost of funds. Further llats
on this facility are not considered necessary In view of the constralnts on
public sector financing imposed by the overall public sector deficit target
and, more particularly, the net domestic assets target of the Bank of
Jamaica. It should also be noted that the Government has increased the
ceillng on the outstanding issue of treasury bills to J$1.5 Billion and
will increase the Issue of variable rate longer-term bonds so as to provide
alternative Instruments to the Government to meet its borrowing needs and
to the Bank of Jamaica for managing liquidity. More specifically, by March
1988 the Government will introduce two new Instruments, one of 180-360 days
maturity and the other a longer term bond with variable Interest rates.
G.        Banking Supervision
19.       One of the objectives of the flanmcial sector reform is to
heighten banks' ability to respond to market forces. The more open system,
however, brings with it the need to assure effective supervisory powers.
The Governuent thus approved in March 1986 amendments to the Banking Act,
Bank of Jamaica Act and the Protection of Depositors Act designed to
strengthen the legal authority of the Bank of Jamaica to supervise the
banking system. Pending passage of the new legislation, the banking
inspection department of the Bank of Jamaica is undertaking a staff
strengthening programe and revising processes and procedures. The
Governmeat is seeking to obtain Parliamentery approval of the legislation
by December, 1987.

H.        Strengthening of Capital Markets
20.       The fiscal system has historically contained an anti-equity bias
which has contributed to the high debt/equity ratios observed for most
companies. The sources of the bias against equity have been mainly:
(i)  the high 452 corporate rate of taxation;
(it)  double taxation of dividends in contrast with interest
payments on long-term deposits, where tax was not withheld
at source; and
(iii)  the stamp duty charged on stock exchange transactions and
the issuance of shares. Important improvements in this
situation have occurred over the past year, t.e., the
corporate tax rate has been reduced to 33 1/32, the tax on
stock exchange transactions has been eliminated, and a 33
1/3% withholding tax on interest payments has been
introduced. By March 1988, further steps will be taken to
remove the anti-equity bias: the tax on issuance of new
shares on the stock market has been abolished and
examination is proceeding to determine what scheme could be
Introduced to reduce the tax on dividends provided such
dividends are retained by the companies to increase equity,
particularly for productive companies or specific sectors,
I.        Strengthenlng of Capital Market Institutions
21.       The Jamaica Stock Exchange needs a number of changes if it is to
play a dynamic role In the financial sector and stimulate equity
investments. Its membership needs to be broadened and it should become
more autonomous, although under an improved regulatory environment. A
study has been initiated to analyze the operations of the securities
market and formulate appropriate recommendations for these operations,
which will provide the basis for preparing drafting instructions for the
proposed Securities Act. This study will be completed by December 1987 and
discussed with the Bank in January 1988. The Government: is in the process
of estaolishing, as an interim measure, a stock market inspection unit.

TRADE AND FINANCIAL SECTOR ADJUSTMENT LOAN
The Import Tariff Rebate System
1.        The Government intends to introduce by April 1, 1988 an Import Tariff
Rebate System which would satisfy the following broad criteria:
(1) Full compensation to exporters for all import duty paid directly and
Indirectly;
(ii) administrative simplicity and credibility;
(iII) meeting of fiscal constraints; and
(iv) conformity with GATT and CARICOM regulations.
The system that best meets these criteria has a small number of rebate rates
applied to the value of exports of goods and services measured as appropriate.
Rate levels and sectoral coverage of the system would be detetmined on the basis
of duties actually paid on production inputs, bearing in mind the total amount
of resources that can be allocated to the system.
2.        During the period of the on-going tariff reform, rebates will be set
at tentative levels reflecting the structure of import duty payment. When the
final tariff structure has been established in 1991, final rebate rates will be
Introduced which reflect as closely as possible the actual import duty payment
by exporters. The proposal made in the Comparative Advantage and Incentive
Study to introduce three rebate rate levels represents a reasonable guideline,
although final rates will be determined on the basis of a detailed analysis to
be performed by the Tariff Reform Committee.
3.        The sectoral coverage of the system will depend upon a number of
factors (resources, administrative feasibility) which will be analysed in detail
by the Tariff Reform Committeeo However, a system covering the most important
sectors can be Introduced prior to the completion of this analysis based on the



- 61 -
ANNEX II
Appendix 7
Page 2 of 2
following criteria: (i) manufactured exports to third markets have the highest
priority for benefitting from the system; they are highly dependent upon
imported production inputs and machinery and they are frequently not competitive
on export markets without duty-free imports; (ii) non-traditional agricultural
exports should also receive the rebate at the earliest possible time;
(iii) tourism (and possibly other export-oriented services) will benefit from
the system; however, before tourism can effectively participate in the scheme a
number of administrative problems may have to be solved; (iv) the following
export activities will not participate in the system for a variety of reasons:
(a) exporters to CARICOM which actually sell in a protected regional market
without restrictions; (b) manufacturers importing inputs duty-free under
existing legislation (Alnisterial remissions, Export Industry Encouragement Act,
807 Scheme, etc.); (c) the bauxite industry which does not pay duty on imports;
(d) agricultural products benefitting from price agreements and quota
arrangements.
4.        The administrative arrangements for the rebate scheme will be
determined by the Government on the basis of an analysis of the Tariff Reform
Committee. The Tariff Reform Committee will elaborate details of rebate
administration by January 1988. The final Government plan for introducing a
rebate scheme will be discussed with the Bank.
