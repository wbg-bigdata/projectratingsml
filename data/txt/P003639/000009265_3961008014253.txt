MEMORANDUM AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT
OF THE
INTERNATIONAL BANK FOR RECONSTRUCTION AND DEVELOPMENT
AND THE INTERNATIONAL DEVELOPMENT ASSOCIATION
TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS
ON A PROPOSED LOAN AND A PROPOSED CREDIT
TO THE PEOPLE'S REPUBLIC OF CHINA
FOR A SOUTHWEST POVERTY REDUCTION PROJECT
1.          I submit for your approval the following memorandum and recommendation
on a proposed loan of $47.5 million and a proposed credit of SDR 128.6 million ($200
million equivalent) to the People's Republic of China to help finance a Southwest Poverty
Reduction Project. The loan would be at the Bank's standard variable interest rate, with
a maturity of 20 years, including 5 years of grace. The credit would be on standard IDA
terms with 35 years' maturity. The proceeds of the loan would be onlent to project entities
at rates no less than the prevailing rates for Agricultural Development Bank of China loans
for similar purposes with repayment in 20 years, including 5 years of grace. The proceeds
of the credit would be onlent to the provincial and county governments of Guangxi,
Guizhou and Yunnan and the central government's Leading Group for Poverty Reduction
(LGPR) for 20 years, including 6 years of grace, with interest at 2.0 percent per year.
The foreign exchange risk would be borne by the provinces of Guangxi, Guizhou and
Yunnan for their respective components.
2.          Sector Background. Broad participation in reform-driven rural economic
growth brought about a tremendous reduction in absolute poverty in China from roughly
270 million poor in 1978 to about 100 million in 1985, or from one third to less than one
tenth of total population. Despite continued rapid overall economic growth and strong
government commitment to poverty reduction, the proportion of total population living in
absolute poverty has declined only slightly since 1985. Most of China's remaining
absolute poor are now concentrated in remote resource-deficient rural areas-primarily in
upland regions of the interior provinces of northern, northwestern and southwestern China
-where they typically comprise entire communities. The very poorest households in these
communities are those further disadvantaged by high dependency ratios, ill health and other
difficulties. Minority peoples are heavily overrepresented among the rural poor. Although
the absolute poor have land use rights, as do all of China's rural population, in most cases
the land itself is of such low quality that even subsistence levels of crop production are
generally not possible. Achieving simple productivity gains on these rainfed uplands,
through increased application of fertilizer, better seed and other modern inputs, has proven
problematic, and the number of the absolute poor now exceeds the carrying capacity of the
land. Furthermore, since these are in many cases some of China's most ecologically
fragile lands, the poor are often both the perpetrators and victims of upland environmental
destruction.



3.          About 25 million of China's remaining absolute poor reside in the remote
upland areas of the southwestern provinces of Guangxi, Guizhou and Yunnan. Absent
meaningful levels of agricultural growth and rural enterprise development during the
1980s, per capita output of grain and subsistence foods did not increase, and off-farm
employment opportunities have little more than kept pace with population growth. The
provision of social services also stagnated in these areas, and education achievement and
health status remains deplorable. At least half of the boys in the poorest towns and
villages and, particularly in some minority areas, nearly all of the girls do not attend
school and will not achieve literacy. Infant mortality rates in the poorest townships and
villages exceed 10 percent, and are about triple the national average. Incidence of several
infectious and endemic diseases, including tuberculosis and iodine deficiency disorders, are
also prevalent in these areas. About half of children in households at or below the absolute
poverty line are at least mildly malnourished (stunted), and iron, vitamin A, and other
micronutrient deficiencies remain a severe problem. As many as 90 percent of poor
children suffer chronic intestinal worm infection.
4.          Labor market liberalization in China, spurred by strong economic growth
and reduced constraints to internal travel and change of residency, has led to unprecedented
labor mobility by at least 70 million migrants in a total rural labor force of 440 million.
For those who have been able to participate in the local and interprovincial migration for
employment process, the income rewards have been substantial, due to the enormous wage
rate differential for low-skill levels. However, the absolute poor in upland areas have not
been able to fully take part in the labor migration process due to (a) labor market
imperfections such as the lack of labor market information, (b) the poor's paucity of even
rudimentary knowledge and skills required for obtaining employment in growth pole areas,
and (c) inadequate financial resources to cover the initial expenses of a job search.
5.          The government's poverty reduction program was established in 1986 and
is coordinated by the State Council's LGPR and the central and provincial Poor Area
Development Offices (PADO). LGPR is the principal advocate of China's rural poor, and
in 1994 issued a new National Seven-Year Plan for Poverty Reduction (8-7 Plan) to
achieve further reductions in poverty. The 8-7 Plan recognizes that the transition and
significant reduction of absolute poverty, from large numbers of poor spread widely across
the countryside in the late 1970s to pockets of poverty in remote resource-deficient areas
by the mid-1980s, makes it easier and fiscally less burdensome to target increased
development and social services assistance to the remaining absolute poor. In near
complete agreement with the World Bank's 1992 report China: Strategies for Reducing
Poverty in the 1990s, the 8-7 Plan calls for:
(a)   institution building and policy reform, including a strengthening of the
institutions responsible for implementing explicit poverty alleviation projects
and programs, the establishment of an independent and objective poverty
monitoring system, the concentration of available funding in the poorest
counties (a number of relatively well-off counties and provinces will be
"graduated" from the poverty reduction program);



-3-
(b)   greater investment in the development of human capital, including more
central government funding for health, nutrition, education, and relief
services in the poorest areas;
(c)   promotion of labor mobility strategies to encourage the organized flow of
low-skill labor from the poor areas to growth pole areas; and
(d)   continued investment in poor-area agricultural, rural enterprise, road and
other rural infrastructure development projects.
6.          Lessons Learned from Previous Bank Group Operations. The Bank's
experience with a large number of multisectoral rural-development-cum-poverty-alleviation
projects has not been entirely successful in terms of impact or sustainability. An extensive
review by the Bank's Operations and Evaluation Department (OED) of two decades of
Bank experience with rural development projects documents that the complexity of project
implementation and problems with institutional coordination have been the principal causes
of mixed results.  Recognizing that these institutional difficulties are inherent to
multisectoral projects, the OED analysis favors the approach of "implementing separate
project components in different ministries as though they were separate projects, but with
a coordinating unit located in a nonsector ministry such as Planning or the President's
Office" and emphasizes the importance of long-term institution building. The OED report
also highlights the importance of (a) strong government commitment to the project and a
favorable macroeconomic environment, (b) relying primarily on locally proven technical
innovations (the results of research and trials were often not available in time to have an
impact on concurrent projects), (c) retaining flexibility in program design during
implementation, (d) supplementing the Bank's own inputs, during design and supervision,
to cover the full range of skills required by a multisectoral project, (e) a comprehensive
monitoring and evaluation process, and (f) full community participation. These lessons are
fully reflected in the design of the proposed project. In particular, LGPR, which is a
nonsectoral office of the State Council, would be responsible for coordinating project
design and monitoring implementation. The project also enjoys strong government support
and a favorable macroeconomic environment, relies primarily on an integrated package of
proven technologies, and would establish a comprehensive monitoring and evaluation
process.  Community participation has been achieved through a process of detailed
consultation in upland communities involving village leaders, a sample of the poorest
households, village teachers, health practitioners and other members of the community.
During project preparation, an independent field investigation in Guangxi and Guizhou by
a cultural anthropologist led to suggestions regarding health, education and labor mobility
component design and implementation, and these were incorporated into specific
component activities. Nongovemmental organization staff also participated in project
preparation missions and advised on community participation in project design and
implementation.
7.          The proposed project also builds on lessons from recent Bank loans to China
in the health, education, agriculture and rural infrastructure sectors. For social services,
specific lessons include the importance of increasing access to existing rural facilities,



- 4 -
improving the skills of teachers and health providers, establishing reliable financing
mechanisms, and upgrading bilingual education in minority areas. In agriculture, the
experience of earlier Bank-supported projects suggests the need for greater emphasis on
crop diversification and marketing in order to avoid the risk of oversupply, and to enhance
sustainability by assigning responsibility for project management to existing institutions
(suitably strengthened). Since the Bank has very little experience with labor mobility
projects, the project builds on lessons from the Chinese Ministry of Labor's recent
experience in this area, ongoing rural research work, and a wide range of counterpart and
village interviews.
8.          Project Objectives.  The primary objectives of the project are to:
(a) demonstrate the effectiveness of a focused rural development project approach to
poverty reduction, (b) facilitate a "market-friendly" increase in labor mobility from the
poor areas to better off rural and rapidly growing urban areas, (c) upgrade poverty
monitoring at the national and local levels, and (d) significantly reduce absolute poverty
in 35 of the very poorest counties in southwestern China.
9.          Rationale for Bank Involvement. The proposed project is consistent with
the Country Assistance Strategy discussed by the Board in August 1993 and the one that
will be discussed by the Board on June 1, 1995, in that it directly addresses two of the
Bank's top operational priorities in China, viz., poverty reduction and environmental
protection. Through the Bank's report on poverty in China (para. 5) and the "International
Conference on Poverty Issues in China" (held in Beijing immediately after the public
release of that report), close collaboration with the Chinese government has been
established and the Bank has played an active role in the development of the new national
strategy for reducing absolute poverty in the 1990s. Bank participation in the project will
greatly assist the operationalization of the Government's 8-7 Plan and it is expected that,
if successful, the Bank-supported project will become the prototype for extension to the
remainder of China's poor areas and the overall poverty reduction program. Bank
involvement in the project (a) will also play a catalytic function in the establishment of an
independent, national-level poverty monitoring system, and (b) is helping to focus the
project's land and farmer development component toward the development and provision
of an integrated package of environmentally sound and farmer-determined technologies for
more productive upland agriculture.
10.         Concept and Description. The proposed Southwest Poverty Reduction
Project would be a focused, participatory, multisectoral attack on absolute poverty in an
extremely resource-deficient area-covering the worst affected upland areas of Guangxi,
Guizhou and Yunnan in southwest China-where previous single-sector actions have not
led to sustainable reductions in poverty. Key components of the project are:
(a)   land and farmer development (30 percent of project costs), using menus
of crop and livestock activities to increase upland agricultural productivity
and reverse the trend of environmental degradation through (i) extension of
improved agriculture and smallholder livestock management techniques and
inputs, (ii) establishment of tree crop nurseries and extension (for high-



- 5 -
altitude and red-soil varieties), (iii) intensification of staple crop production
on the modest amount of available flat land, (iv) terracing for improved
water and soil conservation, and (v) the incorporation of provincial research
institute findings;
(b)   off-farm employment (45 percent of project costs), through (i) a voluntary
system of enhanced rural labor mobility for the upland absolute poor,
supported by skills training, a computerized demand-driven placement
system emphasizing local markets, monitoring of worker safety, prevention
and resolution of abuses, and provision of financial resources to cover initial
job search costs; (ii) support for township and village enterprises (TVE)
consisting of investment credit for labor-intensive commercially viable
agroprocessing, mineral, service and handicraft industries with strong
backward linkages to poor households and environmental safeguards meeting
national standards; and (iii) the Guangxi municipal employment development
subcomponent, which would support a poverty reduction enterprise
development zone for labor-intensive industries, unsubsidized low-cost
housing schemes (including slum improvement and dormitory construction
for migrant workers), mariculture, agriculture, and fast-growing tree
plantations in Guangxi's Beihai, Nanning and Fangcheng municipalities;
(c)   social services and rural infrastructure (22 percent of project costs),
through (i) upgrading township and village health clinics and primary
schools and the training of health workers and teachers, (ii) the development
of mechanisms to insure sustainable access to these social services by the
absolute poor, and (iii) the construction of rural roads, safe drinking water
supply systems, small-scale irrigation, drainage, biogas, and rural
electrification; and
(d)   institution building and poverty monitoring (3 percent of project cost), by
(i) improving LGPR's and PADOs' capabilities in poverty project design
and implementation, procurement, accounting, and monitoring and
evaluation; and (ii) establishing an objective poverty monitoring system by
using improved survey instruments to provide a credible and comprehensive
poverty profile for the project areas, analyze the accuracy of the targeting
of benefits to the absolute poor, and measure and evaluate the impact of the
project's individual components.
11.         Project Implementation. LGPR and its World Bank Project Office have
principal responsibility for project design and implementation. At the provincial level,
Project Leading Groups (PLGs) have been set up to (a) mobilize institutional, technical and
financial resources and support for the preparation and implementation of the project and
(b) provide a critical coordination and monitoring function. In addition, provincial Project
Management Offices (PMOs), comprising PADO staff and an increasing number of
specialized staff from outside the LGPR system, have been established to ensure effective
and timely preparation and implementation of the project. It has also been agreed that,



- 6 -
under the general supervision of the provincial PMOs, the provincial Education, Health,
and Labor bureaus would play leading roles in the implementation of the social services
and labor mobility components. At the county level, PMOs have been established and have
played the lead role in organizing the preparation of the county and subproject feasibility
studies. Working closely with the several technical bureaus directly involved in the project
and with the township governments and their offices at the administrative village level, the
county PMOs would also take the lead role in coordinating project implementation.
County PLGs have been set up to secure coordination among the technical bureaus.
12.         Project Cost and Financing. The estimated project cost totals $486.4
million equivalent, with a foreign exchange component of $145.9 million equivalent
(30 percent). The Bank Group would finance $47.5 million equivalent and SDR 128.6
million ($200 million equivalent), covering all of the foreign exchange costs and about 30
percent of local costs. To allow rapid start-up of work under the project's social services,
labor mobility, land and farmer development, and institution-building components,
retroactive financing of up to $24.75 million has been recommended to cover expenditures
for these items incurred between January 1, 1995 and the date of signing of the Loan and
Credit Agreements. A breakdown of costs and the financing plan are shown in Schedule
A. Amounts and methods of procurement, and the disbursement schedule are shown in
Schedule B. A timetable of key project processing events and the status of Bank Group
operations in China are given in Schedules C and D, respectively. A map is also attached.
The Staff Appraisal Report, No. 13968-CHA dated May 18, 1995, is being distributed
separately.
13.         Project Sustainability. Based on the development of improved extension
services, the selection of a wide range of appropriate crop varieties and livestock breeds,
and the improvement of research capabilities that will support project activities, the land
and farmer development component is likely to be sustainable. Activities supporting off-
farm employment will be sustainable through (a) the emphasis on labor mobility cost-
recovery, (b) TVE selection based on commercial viability, and (c) the provision of
training to county and provincial Labor Bureau staff. Improved education and health
services will be sustainable since the increases in household income levels brought about
through the project will be sufficient to allow for the gradual phase-out of the initial
subsidies for the recurrent costs under the social services component.  Institutional
sustainability is addressed through a comprehensive program of technical assistance,
training, and study tours to strengthen existing capacity and ensure development of long-
term capabilities. The ability to monitor poverty is sustainable, and will increase over time
through the development of enhanced survey instruments.
14.         Agreed Actions. The principal assurances agreed with the Borrower at
negotiations were that: (a) tuition fees would be provided for approximately 90,000
children per year, and cooperative health care funds would be established and adequately
funded in all project villages, (b) project farmers would receive exclusive land use rights
for a term of not less than 50 years for wastelands and other lands they plant to perennial
crops under the project, (c) labor mobility would be undertaken only on a strictly voluntary
basis, and that an adequate monitoring and reporting system, focusing on fair treatment of



- 7 -
workers and workplace safety, would be finalized and implemented; and (d) to achieve the
necessary flexibility in project design and implementation, a full mid-term review would
be undertaken in 1997. In addition, Beihai, Nanning and Fangcheng municipalities would
obtain commitments from all participating project enterprises that at least 70 percent of the
full-time jobs created in those enterprises would be provided to the absolute poor from the
project's upland counties.
15.         Environmental Aspects. This is a Category B project and, overall, the
project is expected to have a favorable environmental impact. In particular, the land and
farmer development component focuses on improving productivity through reversing
upland environmental destruction. Potential minor environmental issues arise from changes
in land use practices, the development of small-scale enterprises, and the construction of
rural roads and other small-scale rural infrastructure. The labor mobility component also
raises several social issues. LGPR has commissioned an Environmental Management and
Mitigation Plan that identifies environmental issues and defines necessary mitigation
measures. These necessary mitigation measures comprise known and proven engineering
and technical solutions, and are covenanted under the project. In addition, the labor
mobility component has been subjected to careful social and anthropological review, and
an effective monitoring system would be established under the project to guarantee migrant
workers' rights and job safety.
16.         Project Benefits. The project would significantly reduce absolute poverty
in 35 of the very poorest counties in southwestern China by increasing the incomes and
productivity and improving the health and educational status of about 2.8 million upland
smallholders. It would also demonstrate the effectiveness of a comprehensive rural
development project approach to poverty reduction, stabilize or even reverse the
environmental destruction of upland areas, upgrade poverty monitoring at the national and
local levels, and encourage greater local community participation by enabling households
to make key decisions during implementation. Project components with quantifiable
benefits, including the land and farmer development, labor mobility, and TVE development
activities, have an overall estimated rate of return of 36 percent.
17.         Risks. The project addresses problems of chronic absolute poverty and
natural resource degradation in an area where previous single-sector interventions have not
led to sustainable reductions in poverty. The greatest strength of the project-its focused
multisectoral rural development approach--comes at the inherent cost of greater than
average complexity and greater difficulties in implementation. This risk was acknowledged
prior to the outset of project preparation, and has been effectively countered by (a) the
project's unique organizational and management structure, which features an existing,
relatively powerful national network of committed antipoverty agencies, (b) a strong
institution and implementation capacity-building program, and (c) the full involvement of
the beneficiaries and village communities in the design and implementation of the project.
In addition, the project relies on an integrated package of proven technologies and
interventions.  County-level governments, where leadership required for effective
implementation is more sustainable due to the local importance of the project, have
extensive experience with these technologies and interventions.



- 8 -
18.        Individual components also face specific risks.  The land and farmer
development component faces a risk of slower-than-expected adoption of improved farming
techniques, which would result in a slower rate of economic and environmental benefits.
However, the project's package of improved farming techniques would (a) require only
limited cash inputs, (b) be integrated with existing farming practices and be supported by
stronger extension services, and (c) be introduced, in some cases, on a pilot basis. The
labor mobility and TVE components face three risks:  (a) inadequate institutional
coordination, (b) sudden market changes, and (c) insufficient worker safety monitoring.
A pilot phase, and the participation of the All-China Women's Federation on a consultative
body of key government agencies, would address these problems effectively. Most TVE
products are intended for use in growing local and provincial markets, minimizing
commercial risks.
19.        Recommendation. I am satisfied that the proposed loan and credit would
comply with the Articles of Agreement of the Bank and the Association and recommend
that the Executive Directors approve the proposed loan and credit.

(a) As credits are denominated in SDRs (since IDA RepLenishment VI), undisbursed SDR credit
balances are converted to dollars at the current exchange rate between the dollar and the SDR.
In some cases, therefore, the undisbursed balance indicates a dollar amount greater than the
original principal credit amount expressed in dollars.
(b) Credit fully disbursed.
(c) Not yet effective.
