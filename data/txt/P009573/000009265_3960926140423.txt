Amounts                  SDR 0.8 million (US$1.06 million equivalent)
Tenmss                   Standard, with 40 years' maturity
Co-finsmciers            The Government of the Swiss Confederation
(GSC) will provide a grant of US$5.0 million.
On-lendint ters:s        From RGOB to BLCi
for investment costs (US$0.83 million) and incremental
operating costs (US$0.23 million) at interest rate of
12Z p.a., payable within 9 years, Including a grace
period of 2 years with BLC bearing the foreign ex-
change risk.
Proiect Descriltions    This proposed IDA-assisted Second Forestry Development
Project covers Paro, Haa and Thimphu Districts in
Western Bhutan where the coniferous forest has been
affected by a pest outbreak. The project would be
part of an integrated program of activities aimed at
restoring the ecological balance, renewing the forest
resot'rces, and enabling the salvage logging of commer-
cially valuable timbers. The project would be admin-
istered by BLC and ID over a six-year period and sup-
ports (a) ID activities in pest and forest management,
and (b) BLC activities, including road construction,
logging, workshop development, marketing, nursery
development and reforestation In the project area, and
improvement of the financial management system. Tech-
nical assistance and training support is envisaged for
both BLC and PD. Funds for BLC's activities would be
on-lent from RGOB to BLC at an interest rate of 12Z
p.a. with repayment within nine years, including two
years grace period. The subsidiary loan would be
denominated in US dollars, with BLC bearing the for-
eign exchange risk. The total project cost is esti-
mated at US$31.3 million, with a foreign exchange
component of US$8.6 million (272). Of the total,



- vi -
investment costs amount to US$11.5 million, and incre-
mental operating costs US$19.6 million, almost all of
which is attributed to BLC's salvage loggivg opera-
tions to be financed from its own revenue generation.
Given its manpower constraint and limited implemen-
tation capacity, the need to concentrate forestry
development efforts on the more urgent needs identi-
fied in the pest-affected areas, the need to make an
early start on essential procurement, and the wish to
minimize the volume of hard currency borrooing, RGOB
requested that the scope of the First Forestry Project
be amended to permit start-up activities in the pro-
posed Second Forestry Project areas, thereby reducing
the additional credit required under the Second
Project. IDA has accepted RGOB's proposal to reduce
logging activities in Southern Bhutan which are sup-
ported by the First Forestry Development Project
(Credit 1460-BHU), and allocate part of the funds for
purchase of equipment and technical assistance needed
to start up activities in the areas proposed to be
covered under the Second Project, and the project
scope and description has been amended accordingly.
Additional IDA support would be provided through the
proposed Second Project, which would be cofinanced by
the Government of the Swiss Confederation (which is
already supporting forestry activities in Bhutan).
The Swiss-financed portion would be administered by
IDA and follow Bank Group's guidelines for procurement
and employment of consultants. The project would also
be implemented in close coordination with the ongoing
UNDP/FAO technical assistance programs in the forestry
sector. Retroactive financing under the IDA Credit
would be provided in the amount of US$100,000. With
these integrated efforts, the project would help mod-
ernize and commercialize forest resource management in
a way that would ensure Lustained utilization and
preservation of the ecosystem, and would also streng-
then the institutional capabilities to plan and manage
these developments. The main project risks include
the possibility of delays in project implementation
and difficulty in containing and combatting the pest
attack; however, a number of measures have been taken
to minimize these risks.



SECOND FORSTRY DEVELOPMENT PROJECT
I. INTRODUCTION
1.01    Forests constitute the largest renewable natural resource in Bhutan.
The Royal Government of Bhutan (ROB) has therefore placed high priority on
the development of this sector as a vehicle for increasing foreign exchange
earnings, employment, and incomes. At the same time, the draft Sixth Plan
(1987/88-1991/92) calls for a cautious policy of renewable resource
exploitation that will provide mAximum protection to the ecosystem. In
addition, the plan suggests that the role of forestry in the national economy
could be expanded more effectively with the aid of the private sector. Thus,
it supports the development of the private sector and the privatization of
some Government activities. Specifically, the sectoral development objectives
emphasize watershed management and afforestation, salvage logging and
reforestation in overmature pest-ridden forests that are now losing a high
percentage of their timber resources, and forest research and scientific
forest management.
1.02    Under the first IDA-assisted Forestry Development (Afforestation)
Project (Credit 1460-BHU), the Forest Department (FD) has been developing the
capacity to undertake an integrated land clearance and reforestation program
in degraded forost areas of Southern Bhutan. This project became effective in
1984 and implementation is progressing on schedule. In 1984, RGOB established
the Bhutan Logging Corporation (BLC) to take over comercial logging
operations from PD. In 1985 a serious pest outbreak In the extensive
coniferous forests in Westerh Bhutan led ROB to seek assistance from IDA to
combat the problem, and made ROB strongly aware of the need for a program
that would focus on the utilization and renewal of forest resources. The
crisis has enhanced Government conmitment to developing a well-defined
resource management program. An IDA identification mission visited Bhutan in
September/October 1985, followed by an PAO/CP preparation mission in
November/December 1985, an IDA preappraisal mission in May/June 198fi, and an
appraisal mission in May/June 1987.
II. BACKGROUND
2.01    The Kingdom of Bhutan is a landlocked country covering about 46,600
km2 in the mideastern Himalayas (longitude 88045' to 92010'E, latitude 260 to
300N). It is bordered on the west, south, and east by the Indian states of
Sikkim, West Bengal, Assam, and Arunachal Pradesh, respectively, and on the
north by the Tibetan Autonomous Region of China. Most of the landscape is
mountainous, with elevations ranging from 200 m to 7,600 m; the highest
mountain is Kular Xangri, which is about 7,600 m. The main rivers (Torsa,



-2-
Raidak, Sankosh, Mangdechu, Kuruchu and Manas) originate in the inner
Himalayas aud all flow to the south, eventually joining the Brabmaputra river
in India.
2.02    Bhutan can be divided into three broad physiographical zones, all
running east to west. The Northern Zone (about 30 km wide) is covered by
perpetual snow, glaciers, and barren rocks, and altitudes are in excess of
4,000 m. The Central Zone, (about 70 km wide), lies between altitudes of
2,000 m and 4,000 m. This zone contains the major forest areas of the country
and enjoys a temperate climate and vegetation. Thimphu, the nation's capital,
and the project area are located in this zone. The Southern Zone (about 50 km
wide) comprises foothills of the Himalayas rising to an altitude of about
2,000 m; here the climate is hot and humid and the natural forest vegetation
dense. Because of the range in altitude throughout the country, monthly
average temperatures vary widely, from O0C (central zone) in winter to 280C
(foothills) in summer, and annual rainfall range from 1,000 mm to 3,000 mm,
with 802 falling between June and September.
2.03    Because of its mountainous terrain, Bhutan is not readily accessible
and transportation presents considerable problems, although roads now link
Bhutan with the Indian plains to the south. The first paved road, which
stretches 175 km from the bordsr town of Phuntsholing to Paro and Thimphu, the
capital, was constructed in 1962. The main road network now totals about
2,000 km and most of it follows the principal river systems. One main east-
west road links Thimphu with Tongsa, near the geographic center of the
country, and Tashigang in the east. There are no railways; the nearest
railhead is about 40 km south of the southern border entry town of
Phuntsholing. The nearest seaport is Calcutta, which lies about 750 km to the
south by road. RGOB has initiated commercial flights between Paro (about 40
km from Thimphu), Calcutta, and Dhaka.
2.04    Although no accurate statistics are available, the total population,
951 of which is rural, is estimated at 1.3 million and growing at about 2.4Z
per annum. With the low population, there appears to be less pressure on
land, food, and housing than elsewhere in South Asia, and the standard of
living appears to be better than the calculated per capita income of about
US$160. Literacy and life expectancy, however, remain low (12X and 46 years,
respectively).
2.05    Agriculture and animal husbandry activities account for about 48? of
GDP. Forestry contributes about 16? while the manufacturing, mining, and
tourism sectors account for some 5S of GDP. Services--including transport,
trade, construction, and government services--account for about 23?, with net
rental income contributing 8Z of total GDP.
2.06    The official currency is the Ngultrum (Nu), which RGOB began issuing
in 1974. As there are no controls on trade and payments with India, the
Indian rupee circulates freely and is interchangeable with the Ngultrum on a
one-to-one basis within Bhutan.
2.07    Administratively, the country is divided into 18 dzongkhags
(districts)t three in Eastern Bhuten, five in Central Bhutan, seven in Western



Bhutan, and three in Southern Bhutan. The district administrations report
directly to the Ministry of Home Affairs through appointed district
administrators (Dzongdags). The Dzongdag is primarily responsible for
cAllecting revenue and more recently, following decentralization, has been put
in charge of implementing much of the development effort at. the district
level.
2.08    Bhutan has long been isolated from the rest of the world, owing in
part to its topography and in part to the deliberate intentions of the
country's past rulers. As a result of this isolation, the people have had a
simple but traditional life-style, with subsistence agriculture and barter
forming the mainstay of the rural economy. Over the past 20 ye&rs, however,
the country has been gradually opened to external influences, as RGOB has been
seeking external assistance to develop and modernize the country. To support
an increased development effort and to expand its sources of economic
assistance, ROB joined the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank in
1981, and the Asian Development Dank in 1982.
2.09    ROOB initiated its first Five-Year Development Plan in 1961.  Both the
First and Second Plans budgeted for development expenditures but did not state
clearly defined priorities. The Planning Commission was established in 1971
to consolidate the planning process. During the Fourth Plen (1976177-1980/81),
District Planning Committees were formed to submit development proposals of
direct interest at the local level. Early Plans concentrated on road
construction to link up rural communities and townships within the Kingdom and
to improve links with its main trading partner, India. Road construction
accounted for about 602 of the First Plan allocation. Education expenditures
rose from 9Z in the First Plan (1961/62-1965/66) budget to 19Z in the Third
Plan (1971172-1975176). Agricultural sector development did not gain priority
until the Fourth Plan, when 29Z of budgeted outlays were earmarked for this
sector.
2.10    Total Plan outlays increased rapidly from Nu 107.2 million in the
First Plan to Nu 1,162.0 million in the current Fifth Plan (1981/82-1985186).
In the Fifth and Sixth Plans, RGOB has not only added programs for siystematic
forest renewal, but has also planned for a significant increase in the
comercial harvesting and utilization of wood resources. While conscious of
the need to provide forest products for the country's wood-based industries,
RGOB intends to see that forest exploitation is managed in a way that will
preserve the ecosystem (see para 1.01).
III. THE FORESTRY SECTOR
A. The Forest Resource
3.01    Bhutan is abundartly endowed with high-grade forests which represent
the country's largest renewable resource and whose foreign exchange earning
potential is probably only second to water. Data on the forest resources are



- 4 -
available from both the Pro-Investment Survey of Forest Resources carried out
from 19'4 to 1979 over some 721 of the land area, and a 1982-83 study of land
use and vegetation cover using satellite (Landsat) imagery. The forest cover
distribution of Bhutan, as determined by Negi from interpretation of this
remote sensing data, is shown in Table 3.1.

To date, over 1.5 million ha of Bhutan's 2.57 million ha of forests have been
surveyed and demarcated.
3.02    Bhutan is the only country in the subcontinent that has been able to
retain as much as 642 (2.57 million ha) of its land under forests. Because of
a relatively low population density, the situation in Bhutan is significantly
better than in neighboring countries where the Himalayan forests have been
much degraded. However, the pattern of forest exploitation in the country has
been uneven. The forests in the south, especially those near the Indian
border and those neas roads and centers of population, have become degraded,
whereas the rest, which are relatively inaccessible, are still virtually
intact.

3.03    The forest resource and sustainable yields as estimated from the
forest resource inventory of 1974179 are presented in Table 3.2.

f_ Net merchantable volume.
3.04    As Table 3.2 shows, Bhutan could easily sustain an overall annual cut
of almost 14 million m3, which is considerably larger than the present
extracted annual volume of around 0.6 million m3 (see Table 3.3). However,
most of the coniferous forests in the country are climax forests whose growth
is static (that is, all incremental growth is offset by an equal volume lost
to death and decay), leading to a considerable loss of incremental timber and
revenue. However, this loss could be retrieved through sound forest
management, which would ensure that trees are harvested prior to the onset of
decay.
3.05    Bhutan has a very diverse fauna and flora, ranging from temperate
(Palaearctic) species in the north to Indo-Malayan in the south Some 500
bird speries have been recorded and at least 5,000 vascular plants are
believed to exist there (country endemism is low but 10-15Z are probably
endemic to the Eastern Himalayas). The sixteen vertebrate species and
subspecies (12 manmals, three birds, and one reptile) that occur in Bhutan are
considered to be threatened with extinction throughout their world range and
are all protected from hunting by law. At least part of the range of most of
these species occurs in one or more protected areas. Even so, illegal hunting
has steadily increased as a result of population growth and the imuigration of
other nationalities into Bhutan. Furthermore, all plant and animal species
and protected areas are under some threat of habitat modification by shifting
cultivation (especially in Eastern Bhutan), stock grazing, and burning of
vegetation. Thus there is an urgent need to conserve and protect the various
ecosystems in the diverse terrain of Bhutan. RGOB recognizes this and is
receiving technical assistance from UNDP/FAO (under project BHU/851016) as
well as the World Wildlife Fund for work in this field. The former would help
develop a strategy for the management of national parks and forest reserves,
while the latter would deal with species conservation.



B. ForestrY in the Economy
3.06    Despite low extraction levels, forests play an important part in the
economy. They are the source of the Efueiood, construction poles, and timbers
that are consumed freely, or at nominal cost, by the rural population. The
forestry sector also contributes about 5Z to total Government revenues (Nu 336
million in 1986/87) through foreet royalties, revenues from sales by BLC and
FD, and excise duties and sales tax levied on all sales of timber and wood
products. In terms of export value, major forest products (such as logs, sawn
timber, and veneer) and minor products (such as resin and tea chest battens)
accounted for Nu 79.2 million, or 16Z of total exports in 1986 out of total
exports for that year of Nu 486 million (US$40 million). There is
considerable scope, within very safe limits and controls, for increasing the
present low levels of extraction and utilizatitin of the forest resource, and
expanding receipts from the sale and expozt of forest products, and thereby
narrowing the country's trade deficit.
3.07    The forestry sector is of strategic importance particularly because
the young and expanding industrial sector is largely dependent on forestry.
At present the private sector wood-based industry consists of about 25 small
sawmills, two veneer plants, and a number of maller enterprises that include
furniture making, tea chests, packing crates, blockboard, broomsticks, matches
and charcoal making. In addition, numerous pitsaw operators ccavert around
100,000 m3 per year into sawn timber. New wood-processing plants are being
established in Southern Bhutan--the integrated plywood/sawnwood mill at Gedu
is now operational and a second phave (comprising a joinery that will convert
plywood and panels from the sister plant into finished products) is being
constructed. A particle board plant near Phuntsholing is also being
developed; it will consume Gedu waste plus lops and tops.
3.08    Present aanual wood extraction is about 0.6 million mi3, of which
approximately 0.4 million mi3 is for local fuelwood (assuming that 152 of this
is supplied from net allowable cut, and the rest from logs and tops and other
waste). The annual extraction of standing volumes is 4.5 of estimated net
allowable cut of 13.9 million m3.  The main categories of users are shown in
Table 3.3.

estimated to be supplied from allowable cut.
b/ Net allowable cut is 13.9 million m3.
Source: PD and BLC, 1987.
Of the 4.5? of net allowable cut extracted each year, an estimated 2.8? is
made up of fuelwood consisting mainly of deadwood collected from the forest,
waste material from the mills, and lops and tops. It appears that total
harvesting capacity can be increased twenty two-fold, or that another 13.2
million m3 of timber can be harvested per year without outpacing natural
regeneration, provided that the extraction takes place under a sound
management and reforestation plan. RGOB plans for the proposed development of
comercial logging activities over the next five years are safely within this
outer limit of the permissible annual harvesting level.
C. Forest Legislation. Policy, and Plans
3.09    The utilization of forest resources in Bhutan is regulated by several
major pieces of legislation and policies, among them, the Bhutan Forest Act of
1969, National Forest Policy of 1974, draft Forest Act and Forest Policy of
1985, and the charter establishing the Bhutan Logging Corporation in 1984.
3.10    The Forest Act of 1969 consolidated numerous directives relating to
forest rights, forest products, and royalties. The Act provided legal
protection to the country's forests by denominating as Government Reserved
Forests those lands over which no one had a permanent, heritable, and
transferable right of use and occupancy. Hunting, fishing, and felling of
trees or burning vegetation by shifting cultivators in Forest Reserves,



- 8 -
National Parks, or Wildlife Sanctuaries were strictly prohibited and penalties
laid down for violators. The felling of trees and grazing rights on forest
land were brought under the control of the PD.
3.11    The National Forest Policy of 1974 directed that 60S  of the land area
should remain under forest cover, and spelled out various aspects of forest
utilization, development, and conservation of soil, water, climate and
wildlife resources. In recognition of the population's need for access to
forest produce and of the increased marketability and value of timber
products, and in an attempt to restrict illicit and uncontrolled encroachment,
the Forest Policy permitted specific permit-holders free entry into the
forests to collect dry fuelwood for their private use. Commercial logging by
private operators was to be prohibited, and all logging was to be carried out
by PD's contractors in approved areas against the payment of royalties and
contractor license fees. The growth of revenue from the forest was to be
limited to 101 per annum. The Policy also recognized the need to demarcate the
forests, prepare working plans for utilization, develop roads to open up these
areas, train technical personnel to manage the forests, and undertake forestry
research.
3.12    In 1979, R0O0  opted for a more conservative approach to forest
resource utilization and severely curtailed felling by comercial operators in
an attempt to minimize overexploitation that did not pav sufficient regard to
good forest management practices.  To help reestablish Detter control and
planning and enforce the intentions expressed in the Forest Policy of 1974, FD
was assigned to undertake all felling and thereafter auction the logs to
private sammills or undertake direct export. Furthermore, exports of logs and
sawn timber were to be gradually restricted to encourage the development of
forest industries and promote an Increase in value added to export products.
These polLcy changes led to a decline In timber productlon because PD's
extractLon capacity was inLtially limited, as were Bhutan's facillties for
processing logs and sawn timber. When PD took over logging in 1979/80, the
volume processed was 1,400 m3 but this was rapidly bullt up to 58,700 m3 by
1983/84. Most of these resources were subsequently transferred to BLC whlch
was able to increase logging capacLty to 100,000 m' by 1985/86 (see Table
3.4).

a/  Includes 58.4 logged by BLC, established in 1984.
bi Approximately 552 of this was woods inventory not
removed from the forest.
3.13    By the time the Fifth Five-Year Plan was introduced in 1980, RGOB's
approach had clearly shifted -- instead of viewing the forest as a revenue
resource, RGOB now saw it as a renewable resource that needs to be managed and
conserved. Furthermore, RGOB recognized the need for a program of phased
extraction together with systematic reafforestation to restore the ecology of
overexploited forests in areas close to roads and centers of population. It
also saw the potential for utilizing forest resources in new areas once they
became accessible by the forest roads that were to be constructed.
3.14    These new policy directions, which were approved from time to time by
the National Assembly, have been incorporated in the new Draft National Forest
Policy initiated in 1985, which clearly ranks conservation of forestry
resources higher than revenue production. The draft Policy lays down an
action plan for several activities, including acceleration of the pace of
afforestation and reforestation in degraded areas; limiting the baneful
effects of shifting cultivation and illicit and indiscriminate encroachment,
felling, fires, and stock grazing in the forests; enactment of comprehensive
legislation on forests and wildlife and environmental conservation; early
demarcation of reserved forest and preparation of sound management plans;
forestry research, training, and extension; and the provision of employment
opportunities through forestry sector development.
3.15    Similarly, the updated Draft Forest Act of 1985 clearly defines the
concessions granted to bona fi4e nationals that will enable them to obtain
their domestic requirement of timber and to collect other minor forest produce
as approved by PD, subject to payment of taxes or royalties levied. However,
the Draft Act emphasizes forest management and grants RGOB powers to curtail



- 10 -
or suspend these concessions in the interest of forest conservation. It also
endows RGOB with new and more explicit powers to regulate forest access,
reclassify land as reserved, as necessary, for the purpose of protection or
preservation, impose duties, and regulate the transit and sale of timber and
forest produce. A parallel Draft Bhutan Wildlife (Protection) Act of 1985
covers the protection of wildlife and natural areas and the provision of
hunting regulations. Although not yet incorpo-ated in the draElt legislation,
environmental conservation has also been a foremost concern of RGOB. RGO0 has
requested ADB's assistance to review both these various draft legislation and
policies as well as the institutional arrangements and operations of the
Ministry of Agriculture and its departments and agencies, to ensure the
consistency of objectives and procedures, and the comprehensiveness of
enabling legislation and orders.
3.16    These activities reflect RGOB's strong commitment to a policy of
regulating the commercial exploitation of the forest resource and ensuring its
continued replacement and protection. The transfer of FD from the Ministry of
Industry and Forests to the Ministry of Agriculture also reflects the change
in emphasis from forestry as an extractive industry to one that requires
sustained management and development.
.R
D. ForestrY Institutions
3.17    FD was established in 1959 to (a) manage the country's forests, (b)
regulate access to and utilization and protection of the forest resources, and
(c) enforce restri-tions and collect taxes and dues. Its functions also
included land preparation and reafforestation, pest management, and wildlife
protection.
3.18    In 1980/81, FD commenced commercial logging activities in line with
Government's decision to curtail logging by private contractors to prevent
possible overexploitation and eliminate harmful extrac'ion practices. The
subsequent rapid expansion of FD's logging activities (see para 3.12) created
the need for a specialized agency to oversee the development vf commercial
logging activities.
3.19    In 1984, RGOB established BLC to take over the logging operations from
FD. The Charter establishing BLC entrusts it with the administration of
logging, extracting, manufacturing, and marketing of timber and other forest
products.
S. External Assistance and IDA Assistance Strategy
3.20    Since 1975, FAO and UNDP have been involved in a number of technical
assistance projects related to a wide range of forestry programs including
forost management, afforestation, logging and road construction, wood
processing and marketing, and training and manpower development. The latest
in this series of projects is the Forest Management and Conservation Project



- 11 -
(BHU/85/016) to be implemented from late 1987. HELVETAS (a Swiss
nongovernmental agency) has also been involved for a number of years in
training for logging and reforestation activities in Bumthang. NORAD
assistance in forestry is also being negotiated, and ADB is financing the
mechanization of forest roads construction under a multi-sector project.
Since 1976, RGOB has maintained arrangements with World Food Programme (WFP)
to provide food assistance in support of forestry development and other
projects in Bhutan; VFP food is distributed as part payment of wages for
laborers employed on the projects and has been found to be an important
incentive in attracting and retaining such workers.
3.21    The first IDA-assisted Forestry Project (IDA Credit 1460-BHU of US$5.5
million) became effective in 1984. Conceived prior to the establishment of
BLC, it supports RGOB's efforts to develop FD's capacity to plan and operate
an integrated logging and reforestation program to support the long-term goal
of managing the country's forest reserves and supply wood-based industries and
exports on a sustained basis. The project has been progressing on schedule and
is expected to be completed by 1990 with the modifications recently introduced
(page iv).
3.22    While the First Forestry Project is starting to develop the country's
experience in systematic planning, logging and reforestation, the proposed
Second Project is intended to utilize some of this experience in the logging
and reforestation in new project areas. A second project is needed because
these new project areas are In the West and are too removed from the First
Project in the South to effectively share equipment and other resources. In
addition, the forest is different (softwood rather than hardwood) and thus has
to be handled differently. The remaining funds available under the first
project would not be sufficient to carry out the work envisaged under the
second project.
3.23    RGOB has requested that IDA maintain the lead in supporting forestry
development activities, by building on the start made with the First Forestry
Project. For reasons of its manpower constraint and limited implementation
capacity, the need to concentrate forestry development efforts on the more
urgent needs identified in the pest-affected areas, the need to make an early
start on essential procurement, and the wish to minimize the volume of hard
currency borrowing, RGOB further requested that the scope of the First
Forestry Project be amended to permit start-up activities in the proposed
Second Forestry Project areas, thereby reducing the additional Credit required
under the Second Project. IDA has accepted RGOB's proposal to reduce forest
clearance and afforestation activities in Southern Bhutan which are supported
by the First Forestry Project (Credit 1460-BHU), and allocate part of the
funds for purchase of equipment and technical assistance needed to start up
activities in the areas to be covered by the proposed Second Project. The
project scope and description for Credit 1460-BHU have been amended
accordingly. The proposed Second Project would address pest management,
forest management, logging, and reforestation at an accelerated pace, which
would be made possible by a higher degree of mechanization and
comiercialization of activities ranging from extraction to transportation and
marketing. BLC and FD would be the implementing agencies. IDA's assistance,



- 12 -
together with the technical support services provided by FAOIUNDP, would
provide the impetus for this next stage of forestry development in Bhutan.
F. Constraints to Develolment
3.24    Sam  of the principal obstacles to the efficient development of the
forestry sector are as follows:
ta)     Lack of Data. Accurate contour maps and aerial photography,
,waich are essential for proper forest management, survey and
monitoring of forest changes, and the formulation of systematic
long-term plans for harvesting and renewal, are still not
available. Furthermore, there is little information on soil
types and their productivity.
(b)     Poor Forest Access. Because of the steep, rugged terrain,
construction and maintenance of access roads for logging and
reforestation operations is a difficult and expensive task if
carried out manually. Mechanization of road construction and
sound advance road network planning would lead to much more
effective and rapid development of the country's forest
resources.
(c)     Lack of Trained Manpower and Eauioment. There are shortages of
trained manpower in forest management, mountain logging,
industrial processing of wood, management of wood-based
industry, and equipment maintenance and repair. So far, only 44
foresters and 420 forest guards have been trained at the Bhutan
Forest Institute (BFI) at Taba. Another major limiting factor
is the lack of equipment needed for extensive logging in the
high-altitude forests of Bhutan.
(d)     Lack of Exoerience in Forest and Pest Management.  Sound forest
management requires that areas destroyed by fire, pests, or
overfelling, and overmature forests undergoing natural decline
should be regenerated. This work is hampered by the lack of
experience (in techniques of seed collection, nursery
management, and natural regeneration); the lack of well-
established forest nurseries; and the dearth of silvicultural
data. In addition, stock grazing in forest areas is a serious
obstacle to successful tree regeneration and effective soil
conservation; the principal remedial measure, namely fencing,
has proved both expensive and largely unsuccessful.
(e)     Weak Efforts to Prevent Forest Degradation. A major constraint
to long-term conservation of forest resources is the activities
that are presently degrading and destroying the forest and other
natural areas, notably shifting cultivation and uncontrolled
livestock grazing. Beside the need to enforce adequate control



- 13 -
measures, RGOB needs to finalize draft policies and legislation
as well as a national conservation plan with soecific proposals
to revise the protected area system, revitalize species
conservation, initiate applied wildlife research as a basis for
management, and introduce environmental conservation, as well as
an environmental impact assessment of development programs.
(f)     Potential Widesiread Destruction of Forest Resource by Pest
Attack. Recent epidemic outbreaks of bark beetle attack
triggered by unhygienic logging practices in the extensive
coniferous forests of Bhutan have already killed over 2,000 ha
of spruce over the last two years, and threaten at least
60,000-100,000 ha in the vicinity. There is evidence that the
pest is capable of spreading into other coniferous areas which,
because of their age, are sus:eptible to attack. This brings
another 100,000-150,000 ha unler potential risk of attack. The
effects on the country's forast resources and the environment
could be devastating. RGOB has requested external assistance to
combat the spread of the pest and reduce its population to
normal levels, salvage the dead trees, and recover their value
before they deteriorate irretrievably.
G. Proiect Rationale
3.25    The serious pest outbreak in the coniferous forests described in para
3.24 (f) above led RGOB to request for IDA's assistance through a Second
Forestry Project, through which IDA would take the lead in coordinating
forestry development activities and utilizing inputs from various donors in an
integrated pest and forestry resource management program. However, beyond the
immediate need for pest management, a comprehensive forest resource management
and development program is needed for Bhutan to address all the other
fundamental needs highlighted above. A number of measures are needed. First,
topographic information is required for detailed management planning of forest
extraction and renewal. Second, a well-designed strategic road network should
be constructed according to the management plans. Third, emphasis must be
placed on manpower training and on using appropriate equipment. Fourth, a
long-term program of silvicultural management and research must be instituted
that focuses on sustained utilization and conservation of the renewable
resources. RGOD has requested IDA assistance to design and implement a project
along these lines. The proposed Second Forestry Project would follow the
First (Afforestation) Project, Credit 1460-BHU, which became effective in 1984
and is being successfully implemented in Southern Bhutan. The scope of the
First Project was recently amended to permit an early start-up of integrated
pest management operations in the pest-attacked areas.

altitude from valley bottom to watershed ridge top ranges from 2,500 m to over
4,000 m above sea level. The towns of Paro and Ha are situated in the
valleys, 13 and 14 km respectively by road below the project area. Access to
the project area in the Paro and Baa watershed is by a single-lane all-weather
tar-sealed public road that connects the towns of Paro and Ha, passing over
the Chelaila mountain saddle at an elevation of 4,000 m. The Paro and Haa
valleys are connected by single-lane, all-weather roads to Thimphu, the
capital of Bhutan, and the travel times to Thimphu are approximately 1-1/2,
and 4 hours respectively. From Thimphu, the travel time to the Wangchu valley
is about 112 hour. The townships of Paro, Ha, and Thimphu house the
administrative headquarters of their respective Districts. They are each
served by locally generated electricity and are connected by telephone.
Tsalimaphe village, to the north of the Chamgang block, also has a telephone
connection to Thimphu.
4.03    The following statistics pertain to the administrative districts of
Paro, Haa, and Thimphu.

Topography. Geoloav. and Soils
4.04    The terrain is extremely steep and mountainous--80% of the slopes have
gradients between 25? and 802, and 5? of the slopes have gradients in excess
of 502. The Paro series of Pre-Cambrian rocks in the area generally consist
of crystalline limestone, calcareous silicates, schist, gneiss, flaggy
quartzites, pegmatites, and quartz veins. These rocks do not present problems
for road construction. The forest soils, for the most part, are brown and
grey podsolics of sedimentary origin and generally leached. Seventy-five
percent of these soils are 30 cm or more deep, and the subsoil and weathered
parent material provide good root permeability, as is evident from the high
stocking of the forests, some of which have standing volumes of at least 600
i3 per ha.
Climate
4.05    The climate of the Paro, Haa, and Wangchu subcatchments is typical of
the dry valleys of the interior, with hot summers and cold winters. The
maximum temperature in July is 250C (average for July/August is 170C) and the
minimum temperature in December is -7%C. The climate is classified as
temperate, and most of the rain falls during the summer monsoon, which lasts
from May to September. Annual precipitation in the valley bottom is about
650-750 mu, but upward of 2,500 m the rainfall increases and mist is common on
the ridge tops between 3,500 and 4,000 m. Drought is experienced about one
year in five.
B. Forest Resources
4.06    Data on the composition of forest type and other land use in the
subcatcbments within the project area are described in Table 4.3.

Sourcet Negi, Forestry Development in Bhutan, 1983.
About 77Z of the area in the subcatchments is forested; up to half of the
trees here are mixed conifers that have been attacked by pests, and another
30-40? are fir and blue pine that are also susceptible to the pest attack.
4.07    The project area falls within the mixed conifer and fir belts, at an
altitude of 2,500 to 4,000 m. The predominant species in the mixed conifer
belt is spruce (Pices sginulosa). At the lower altitudes, spruce is mixed
with blue pine (Pinus wallichiana), and at the mid-altitude with hemlock
(Tsuta domosa) and larch (Larix ariffithiana). At higher altitudes, fir
(Abies densa) forms an increasing proportion of the mixture, which eventually
gives way to pure fir forest above 4,000 m altitude. Different species occur
on the south and east faces of the mountains, including oaks (Quercus
semicaruifolia and j. variabilis), which are valued for fodder and fuelvood.
Grasses are important for cattle grazing.



- 17 -
4.08    The forests contain a great many mature, overmature, diseased and
dying trees. The spruce in particular, is severely threatened by the
Himalayan bark beetle (Do op.) which is preJsent in epidemic pror.rtions in
the project area. The beetle also attacks blue pine. The main areas affected
are in the project area, but there is also evidence of smaller beetle
,utbreaks in Eastern Bhutan. The larvae of the defoliating looper moth
Abraxus op. have been recorded as a pest on fir but are not currently a
problem. Honey fungus and other fungal diseases are common on overmature
firs. The forests here are in urgent need of good management.
C. Forestry Activities and ExistinaQ Facilities
4.09    Ongoing forestry activities within the project area comprise logging
and associated forest road construction by BLC, and regulation, conservation,
and occasional reforestation by FD. This work is undertaken by the respective
Divisional offices of BLC and FD At Paro and Thimphu, both of which oversee
their subordinate Range offices at Paro, Haa, and Thimphu Districts. Overall,
the area has the basic insti*ational set-up needed to carry out systematic
logging and reforestation under the proj3:t.
4.10    Most of BLC's logging and road-building capacity is at present
concentrated on salvage operations in the beetle-infested areas of Paro, Haa,
and Thimphu Districts. To date, its operations have consisted of building
temporary access/spur roads and selectively logging the dead spruce trees
before they deteriorate. These operations, however, have not been part of a
clear pest-management strategy, and BLC has had to go back to the same
locations repeatedly as more trees were attacked. The roads here have had to
be constructed on an ad hoc basis and are not part of an overall road network
design. The major constraints to further development of salvage logging is
the lack of road-construction and logging equipment suitable for the steep,
rugged terrain. The long-term potential for systematic logging and
reforestation in the project area is excellent if these inputs can be made
available.
4.11    BLC estimates that it would need to increase its overall annual
logging capacity from the present level of approximately 100,000 m3 to about
150,000 m3 over the next four years, to salvage the beetle-attacked trees.
This target will be difficult to reach with the existing road building and
logging equipment, and limited local contract labor and workgangs available to
perform manual logging. Additional equipment and trained manpower are
requ;.red foi7 the salvage operations. An effective pest management program is
also required, together with an adequate survey and monitoring system.
Furthermore, strategic road networks and efficient logging plans would need to
be designed as part of an integrated pest management program.
4.12    The equipment that BLC has transferred to the three project Districts
fails to meet the present requirements. In Paro District, three long cable
cranes purchased in 1978 can only yard up to about 9,000 m3 per annum. One
small underpowered short cable crane (Timber Master) that is in fair condition



- 18 -
is capable of yarding about 4000 m3 per unit per annum. Manual rolling by
contractors provides the remaining yarding resources available. All loading
and log transport are done on contract. In Haa District, no equipment has yet
been provided in 'he beetle-attacked areas. Two long cable cranes are
operating at Damthang outside these areas. All road work and logging are
performed manually by contractors. In Thimphu District, salvage logging has
just started in the affected areas in Chamgang Valley. Road building is being
done with a bulldozer that is still in fair condition but is not equipped to
build roads in forest conditions. All yarding is being done manually.
Because of tho need to extend the forest road network, BLC's estimated logging
output in 1987 in the three project districts (using existing manual and
mechanical logging methods) is as follows:  Paro 25,000 m3; Haa 15,000 m3
(excluding Damthang); and Wangclhu Logging Division (covering Thimphu District)
20,000 m3.  The total expected output is 60,000 m3.  The road access to the
affected areas will have to be developed. Public roads of suitable standards
exist in the Paro and Haa valleys, but t' existing road to Chamgang is poor
and should be upgraded. A public road from Paro over the Chelaila Pass to Haa
goes through the Paro project area and provides a vital link to the Haa
operations.
4.13    In the project area, VD's territorial divisions operate small forest
nurseries in Paro, Isuna, Haa, Khasadrupchu, and Thimphu, which provide
seedlings for plantations and local farmers. At present, these nurseries only
supply about 70,000 seedlings per year and reforestation is being carried out
on a small scale. However, to meet the needs of the sizable salvage
operations anticipated and to undertake timely reforestation of logged areas,
it would be necessary to expand nursery operations considerably. FD also
grants local permits for collecting firewood and cutting trees for house
construction, and regulates access to forest areas. Wildlife protection in
the project area ie mna'ged by FD's Northern Wildlife Circle (headquartered at
Thimphu).
V. THE PROJECT
A. Obiectives and General Description
5.01    The objectives of the proposed Second Forestry Development Project are
to strengthen the managerial and technical capacity of BLC and FD to:
(a) control the epidemic pest outbreak in coniferous forest areas
by a bark beetle management program supported by logging, road
building and reforestation activities;
(b) coordinate management planning, pest management,
harvesting, and reforestation;
(c) produce and market wood; and
(d) institute effective financial control.



- 19 -
5.02    The project covers Paro, Haa, and Thimphu Districts in Western Bhutan
and would be implemented by FD and BLC over a six-year period, including the
preproject year (1987). A number of start-up activities are being carried out
in the preproject year (1987), funded in part under the ongoing First Forestry
.Afforestation) Project, the scope of wh ich has been modified for this
purpose (see para 3.23), and in part under ongoing UNDP and FAO-financed
techaical assistance programs. The project would specifically utilize 12
manmontha of technical assistance and equipment provided under UNDP/FAO
project BHU/851016 (para 6.29 below). This arrangement would ensure that a
coordinated effort is made in forest sector development without overtaxing the
scarce local forestry staff and resources.
B. Detailed Components
5.03    The project components support the following activities within the
project areas
(a)  Pest and Forest Manaaement - pest surveillance and
Implementation of a bark beetle management program in the
affected areas including preventive and counteractive measures,
which are closely linked to general forest management;
(b) Loaning - treatment of approximately 2,640 ha of mixed
coniferous forest under a program of salvage logging, to remove
economically salvageable dead trees within the context of a
proper silvicultural management plan;
*c) Road Construction - building 15 km of permanent access roads as
part of a long-term management plan, and 5 km of spur roads in
areas selected for salvage logging;
(d)  WorkshoD Facilities - provision of (i) a modern workshop at Paro
to repair equipment, and (ii) araining to upgrade the skills of
the mechanics and supervisors, so that they will be able to
service the equipment procured for the logging and road
construction components;
(e) Nursery Develoiment - establishment of a permanent nursery at a
central location in the project area, with contingency funds for
a second nursery, if found necessary;
(f) Reforestation - regeneration (national and artificial seeding
and replanting) of native tree species in clearcut areas with
provisions for controlling stock grazing and for fire
control facilities so as to permit effective regeneration;
(g) Marketing Support - provision of sheds, equipment, and technical
assistance and training to help develop a more active marketing
strategy for timber products; and



- 20 -
(h) Support to BLC Manaaemen: - provision of vehicles, facilities,
and technical assistance to help strengthen management skills,
including assistance for setting up a comlertial accounting
system.
Of these (a) would be implemented by FD, and (b) to (h) by BLC. Each of
these components is described below.
Pest and Forest Manaiement Component
5.04    The primary goal of the proposed integrated bark beetle management
program is to bring the beetle population dovn to manageable proportions and
to restore the natural dynamic balance in forest stands which has been
disturbed by human activities such as unhygienic logging and improper forest
management. Both preventive measures (improving forest hygiene, tree and
stand vigor, and reduction of damage on trees), as well as counteractive
measures (including reduction of the beetle population) will be employed,
including the use of bio-technical methods such as trapping with phecomonest
it is anticipated that no pesticides would be needed (see also para 8.10).
Successfully implemented, the program should prevent the beetle outbreaks and
resultant tree deaths that have affected over 2,600 ha in the past three
years.
5.05    The program gives high priority to (a) research and surveys to be
initiated by the Research Division of PD, with the assistance of a consultant
entomologist; (b) additional staffing and training of Research Division staff;
and (c) improved coordination between FD and BLC. The Head of the Research
Division would oversee this program. He would make recommendations to the
Management Division on bark beetle management strategies and have substantial
input into the formulation of management plans and logging prescriptions. He
would also formulate instructions and extension messages for both PD
territorial and BLC logging staff and initiate regular dialogue with these
parties for the continual review of the program.
5.06    Strict forest hygiene would be observed in all logging activities and
include the timely removal of harvested material and/or debarking. Trapping
(including use of specific biological attractants developed through laboratory
research) would be done in carefully-managed strategic areas during the beetle
flight season (April to October). In preparation for this program, RGOB has
restricted private felling and pitsawing in affected areas, and authorized BLC
to supply villagers with their timber requirements from its de ots. In
addition, ED has undertaken supplementary measures to (a) train field staff on
pest control practices; (b) improve extension through simple brochures,
village competitions, schools, etc.; (c) employ former pitsaw operators in
logging and reforestation; (d) supply villagers' wood requirements from PD and
BLC nearby depots, where practicable; and (e) keep migratory herds out of
pest-attacked and regenerated areas for reasons of hygiene control and
reforestation.



- 21 -
5.07    There is an urgent need to identify attacked areas, the extent of
damage, and the course of the bark beetle outbreak, and to clarify vital
aspects of the ecology and population dynamics of the bark beetle. The
Research Division would be strengthened by the addition of one ranger and two
foresters who would be trained in forest protection. One additional vehicle
would also be provided. A consultant in forest entomology would assist the
Research Division, starting in late 1987, and would return for two months
every year to initiate and conduct research, develop practical methods for
survey and population and risk estimates, and help build up forest protection
competence within the FD. The project provides funds for satellite imagery to
monitor forest changes. The project also provides for training and a study
tour for Research Division staff in forest entomology and in the
implementation of pest management programs. Detailed costs are presented in
Annex 1, Table 1, and the Supplementary Volume, Annex 1. Technical assistance
to be provided includes a field silviculturist for 24 months in 1988-89,
primarily to help the Management Division of FD train staff in marking trees
according to sound silvicultural prescriptions, plan silvicultural research,
and tebt different techniques aimed at promoting natural reganeration); and a
silvipasturallrangeland management expert for a total of 3 man-months in 1988
and in 1989. Under the project, a forest ranger in FD would also be trained
in rangeland/silvipastural management. At negotiations, agreement was reached
that the additional ranger and two foresters would be appointed by April 30,
1988.
5.08    Within the pest-attacked areas, about 2,640 ha of affected coniferous
forests would be selectively logged or clearfelled and some 600,000 m3(H) of
logs extracted during the project period. Mechanized logging systems are
required to permit timely logging and removal of logs as part of the
integrated pest management program and to salvage attacked trees before they
become uneconomical to harvest, as well as to reduce the reliance on manual
logging which is costly, time consuming, and environmentally more destructive
(para 7.03). The mechanical systems would employ cable yarding in the
mountainous terrain, and rubber-tired articulated skidders to log less-than-
4O0 slopes, and to clear road right-of-ways. The following methods of
extraction would be employedt
Yarding System                     Yardina Criteria
(1)  Long-Distance Cable Crane          1000 m on slopes over 70?
(2)  Short-Distance Tower Yarder        300 m on slopes 30-70?
(3)  Wheeled Articulated Skidder        400 m on slope less then 40?
(4)  Manual Logging                     to clean up small areas
The proposed short cable (Hilead) system could be used effectively to clear-
cut up to 70? of the area, but it could also be used in a selective logging
system if required. Manual logging, though reduced, would still be employed;
this, as well as debarking (as needed), would be handled by private contract
workers on a piece-rate basis. The lack of accurate contour maps and
inventory data has seriously hau.pered detailed planning. A logging engineer
is needed during the first i4 months of the project to make detailed studies
of the areas to be logged and to develop logging plans and other operational
details.



- 22 -
5.09    Control logging would be undertaken as part of the integrated pest
management program as well as salvage logging in order to remove valuable
timber before it becomes uneconomical to harvest. The FD has been marking
only dead or dying spruce in the affected areas with the result that, as the
bark beetles spread, BLC has had tc go back into the same area repeatedly
until these areas are virtually clearcut. The project would therefore adopt
the clear-cut method of logging in the affected areas so that an efficient
logging system can be developed and these areas can be reforested as soon as
possible. The project anticipates gradual installation of the new systems.
According to conservative estimates, production is expected to be 97,000 m3
(H) in 1988, 125,000 in 1989 and 130,000 thereafter, although installed
logging capacity would eventually be around 150,000 m3 (H) per year.
5.10    At full production, the logging units would employ 195 staff and 72
loggers, not including manual logging contractors. Existing staff total 134,
and 61 more would be recruited at various levels. The loggers would be
recruited from ex-trainees from the forestry schools; Lame Gompa school alone
has trained 300 since its inception. Technical assistance would be provided
by way of a logging management consultant, logging engineer, and three
technical loggers over the project period. The project would also provide
approximately US$3.8 million (Nu 48.8 million) worth of vehicles and logging
equipment with an adequate provision for foreign exchange to purchase spare
parts during the project period. Detailed costs are given in Annex 1, Table
2, and a more detailed description in the Supplementary Volume, Annex 2. At
negotiations, agreement was reached that FD (with the assistance of the Forest
Management and Forest Inventory/Data Processing specialists provided under
UNDP/FAO project BHUt85/016) would instituS.s a preharvest inventory of the
p ,ject area to provide more reliable data for their logging forecast and work
plans, and would also complete a logging study by December 31, 1988.
Roads Comonent
5.11    The project would provide for the construction and maintenance of
about 20 km of road, about 15 km of which would be permanent surfaced all-
weather road, and about 5 km would be secondary roads. Road density is
intentionally minimized to reduce the risk of erosion, but the road network
would be carefully located to enable maximum strategic access to pest-attacked
areas. Road construction would be mechanized and undertaken by construction
units of BLC (one in each project district). At the peak period of activity,
the road construction and maintenance program would employ a total of about 70
personnel.
5.12    BLC has formed an Engineering Division to determine the road locations
and logging layout. Maps are an essential tool for this exercise. RGOB has
obtained most of the necessary maps from the Survey Department of India and
the last batch will be delivered by June 30, 1988, in time for project start-
up.   These detailed maps would permit more detailed planning of logging
layout and optimal road alignment in the project area.



- 23 -
5.13    Metalled roads, 3.0-3.5 m, wide and with frequent turnouts are
recommended for the permanent roads. The maximum favorable gradient should be
10, with the maximum adverse gradient limited to about 5Z. Temporary roads
with no surfacing could be constructed with 102 favorable grades, but water
bars should be constructed after logging to prevent ertaiioa. Road alignment
would be carried out by a trained surveyor in each area under the supervision
of the Engineering Division. Ideally, the road alignment survey and
demarcation of the logging areas should be carried out at least two to three
years before logging to ensure that there is adequate time fcr planning the
road construction program and to allow the roads to be constructed six months
to a year before they are used by the heavy logging trucks. A road
construction supervisor would be provided under technical assistance. Details
are given in Annex 1, Table 3, and the Supplementary Volume, Annex 2.
Worksho, Component
5.14    The existing workshop in Paro would ba upgraded to provide repairs for
all project equipment (except major repairs to be undertaken at PWD's workshop
at Gaylegphug). Two mobile repair trucks would provide service and running
repairs to all field equipment in the three Districts. Fuel storage tanks
would be situated in each District and a fuel truck would distribute fuel in
each area. Stores would be kept at the main workshop at Paro as well as the
proposed two smaller workshops at Haa and Chamgang. The project would provide
a Workshop Supervisor under technical assistance who would assist BLC staff in
the design and construction of a suitable upgraded workshop and auxiliary
building at Paro. He would help identify the needs of the equipment
maintenance program and procurement schedule in collaboration with the local
staff--a mechanical superintendent and three workshop foremen. Details of
this component are given in Annex 1, Table 4, and the Supplementary Volume,
Annex 2.
Nursery Development Component
5.15    In clearfelled forest areas, natural regeneration would be somewhat
unreliable and direct seeding is as yet untested as a means of quick and
effective regeneration. It would therefore be necessary to upgrade existing
or establish new forest nurseries to provide planting stock as soon as
possible. Three nurseries, with total capacity of 2.8 million plants, would
be upgraded and developed to provide planting stock to supplement whatever
natural regeneration may be possible. Initially, container plants would be
produced but experiments would start with bare-root stock. Each nursery would
be provided with buildings, trained staff, irrigation, and other facilities.
In view of the long period required in the nursery (14 to 28 months) before
the different varieties of seedlings can be planted out, work on the nurseries
has been started in the pre-project year (1987). Sites for these nurseries
have been identified in the vicinity of the planting areas at an altitude of
about 2,500-3,000 m. A central office block and seed treatment and storage
facilities would also be built in Paro town. A nursery and reforestation
consultant to be recruited under UNDP/FAO project BHU/85/016 would be
available to work for 12 months in the project area, and would provide on-the-
job training for local staff in seed collection, testing, and storage.



- 24 -
5.16    The main species to be produced in the nurseries is spruce, which is
the dominant climax species in the project area. Spruce grows reasonably fast
and although it has been attacked by Ins bark beetle, other conifers are just
as liable to be attacked. However, since spruce (like fir and hemlock)
requires at least 28 months in the nursery, some blue pine and larch would
also be included, especially in the first year of planting (Year 3 of the
project) as these species require only 14 months in the nursery.
5.17    Seed would be collected from designated seed stands, processed and
stored at Paro, and issued to the nurserymen. The seed collection unit would
have a seed store and cone-drying shed and would be staffed by a forester,
forest guard, storekeeper/clerk, and five tree-climbers. This unit would also
be provided with climbing and collection equipment, two tractors, and four
trailers and trays. More details of this component are given in Annex 1,
Table 5, and the Supplementary Volume, Annex 3. This component would be
managed by BLC to enable better coordination with the reforestation program,
and FD nurseries in the project area which are selected for upgrading to meet
project requirements would be handed over to BLC. BLC would undertake nursery
development and reforestation only in the project area and in the areas which
they log. In the longer term, it is intended that the nurseries would be
handed back to PD and used to supply seedling stock for PD's regular
afforestation programs.
Reforestation Component
5.18    The reforestation component would bring some 2,640 ha of overmature
and poorly generating spruce and mixed conifer forests, currently under attack
by the bark beetle, under good forest management. About 740 ha of these would
be left standing, and reforestation would take place on the remaining 1900 ha.
Three methods of regeneration would be employeds (a) natural regeneration on
an estimated 480 ha, (b) direct seeding on 70 ha, and (c) planting of
seedlings on 1350 ha. These 1900 ha would also be maintained over the project
period. The schedule for the artificial regeneration of the 1,420 ha by
direct seeding and planting is shown in Table 5.1.

5.19    The silvicultural techniques to be applied under the project would be
adapted to the respective stands to promote maximum natural regeneration.
Natural regeneration (mainly of blue pine) is expected on approximately 100
ha/year. Direct sowing will be employed to regenerate 35 ha/year in 1988 and
1989, during which time there will still be insufficient nursery stock to
plant all areas. Natural regeneration areas and direct sowing areas would be
weeded up to 8 times in the first 5 years. About 702 of the project area
(1,900 ha) would be regenerated by planting. Pine planting would be
concentrated in areas below altitudes of 3,000-3,100 m, larch (on moist areas)
and spruce (with some small areas of hemlock on an experimental basis) planted
above 3,100 m. Plantings would be spaced at 2 m x 2 m (2,500 plants/ha).
Five weedings, requiring 8 man-days/ha (as opposed to 5 man-days/ha for
naturally regenerated or seeded areas), would be undertaken by hired laborers
In the first five years. Geometrical planting should be supplemented with
some experiments in group planting.
5.20    Grazing privileges in the forest are grnted to migratory herds of
cattle and yaks, and have resulted in intensive grazing of the entire project
area. To ensure the success of new plantations in the clear-felled areas,
livestock must be kept out of planted areas until the seedlings !row above
browsing or trampling height. Therefore, BLC's annual felling and replanting
plan will be finalized on the basis of agreements worked out between the
Territorial Division of FD, local administrators, and the concerned livestock
graziers for each plantation site. Plantation strategies would be agreed on
with local herders and experiments would be carried out during the first year
to help determine (a) the criteria for use of fencing and types of fencing
that are appropriate, (b) the circumstances in which plantation watchers would
be needed, and (c) the possibilities for providing alternative fodder through
rangeland improvement or rotational planting strategies. Fencing would be



- 26 -
carried out in all plantations during the first year, and only included in
subsequent years on the basis of criteria determined through the experiments,
and agreed on between the affected parties.
5.21    To ensure adequate fire control in the regenerated areas, furls would
be provided for the construction of firebreaks around plantation blocks and
for the maintenance of patrols and look-outs during the fcrest fire season
(December-March). Nine mobile and three fixed radios would be used by the
patrols and would be kept at f'Ire towers in each of the three planting areas,
at the nurseries, at Paro Workshop and at PD headquarters at Thimphu (which is
in telephone contact with Paro). Fire-suppression units (mounted on trailers
and pulled by agricultural tractors) would be established at each forest
nursery and at Paro township. Provision has been made for introducing a fire
danger rating system and for training fire crews in forest fire suppression.
5.22    The project would provide for eight field offices in a block of 125
m2, two stores (each of 150 m2) to house equipment and World Food Program food
supplies for laborers, three units of semi-permanent housing to accommodate
staff, and nine units of temporary accommodation for some 300 laborers. Three
station wagons or pick-ups, will be provided together with radio communication
sets (VHF) and spare parts. Tools and equipment would also be provided for
surveying, planting, weeding, and fire protection. Training in fire
prevention and control would be carried out on the job by the logging
consultants. Detailed costs of the Reforestation program to be implemented by
BLC are given in Annex 1, Table 6. Costs of the TA and Training to be
provided to PD are included in Annex 1, Table 1. A more detailed description
of this component is provided in the Supplementary Volume, Annex 3.
Marketinx Comonent
5.23    The Marketing Division of BLC would be responsible for handling all
the timber sales, which are expected to be double the pre-project sales.
Existing staff would be redeployed and trained in log grading and sawn-product
specification. They would also be trained to supervise log stacking, haulage,
sawing and preservation of log and lumber quality in the period before final
sales. Contact would be established with the Forest Research Institute at
ehra Dun, India, to undertake studies on Bhutanese timbers, their technical
classifications, and potential uses. The information gained would be
circulated to potential buyers, initially in India. The project would develop
this knowledge and the ability to undertake such sorting and grading of timber
output within Bhutan itself, thereby gaining for it some of the markup that is
currently accruing to a chain of timber traders who take over the bulk of
BLC's production, and repackage for supply to various end-users in India.
Technical assistance provided under the project includes a sawmilling expert,
a saw doctor, and sawyer. Provision is also made for species testing in
India, sawmill recovery and marketing studies, and study tours for staff and
savmillers to successful counterparts in neighboring countries. Timber sheds,
mechanical loaders and sawing equipment would also be provided to introduce
new techniques of handling and processing, which would be further disseminated
by BLC to the local industry. Auctions would be held in Paro, Phuntsholing,
and, if possible, in the Delhi area, which is a major center for the timber



- 27 -
trade in India. In addition, BLC should negotiate more direct sales with
large users in India such as makers of cooling towers, cable drums, customized
joinery items, and so on. More details of this component are given in Annex
1, Table 7, and in the Supplementary Volume, Annex 4.
Supnort to BLC Manaaement
5.24    Under the agreed pre-project actions, BLC has recruited two additional
accountants at headquarters. BLC has also enlisted the help of the Royal
Audit Authority's (RAA) financial consultant to help review and revise its
accounting policies, procedures and systems. These improvements are required
to ensure proper financial control and to accurately determine profits and
losses. They would also make it possible to improve management control over
inventory, monitor shrinkage and other losses, and improve cost accounting,
budgetary control, forecasting, and management reporting. The project would
provide for a financial management consultant for 4 months over two years in
periods of two months each to continue the work initiated by RAA's financial
consultant. More details are provided in paras 6.21-6.22 below and in Annex
1, Table 8, and in the Supplementary Volume, Annex 5.
C. Prolect Cost Estimates
5.25    Over the six-year project period, base figures for investment costs
are expected to be Su 131.2 million (US$10.5 million), and incremental
operating costs Nu 340.9 million (US$27.3 million); 97? of the latter would be
covered from revenues generated by BLC. The duties and taxes included in
these figures are negligible as all materials directly imported for use by
government departments and agencies are free of taxes and duties. The foreign
exshange component of the investment costs is 62?, and of incremental
operating costs, 8?, totaling US$8.6 million (including contingencies). Base
costs are calculated on prices adjusted to November 1987, the expected date of
negotiations. Physical contingencies have been applied to the base cost at 4?
for civil works, machinery and equipment, operating costs, and training, but
not to salaries, labor wages, payments to contractors and technical
assistance. Based on Bank's projections (October 1987), price contingencies
for 1988 and subsequent years were applied to the base cost at 7.7X, 1.9?,
4.32, 0?, and 3.8? respectively, fqr foreign costs, and at 6? per year for
local costs. At negotiations, project costs were updated using new Bank
projections of 8? for local costs, and 9? for foreign costs for FY 87/88.
Both physical and price contingencies constitute 12.82 of the project base
cost and are considered to be adequate to cover future price increases and/or
occasional delays during the project period.
5.26    The Project Cost Tables shown in Annex 1 give details of expenditure
items by each project component, including breakdown by foreign and local
cost. The information is summarized as follows (see also Table 5.2):
(a) Total foreign exchange costs of US$8.56 million--comprising
US$6.50 million in investments, US$1.35 million in incremental



- 28 -
operating costs, and US$0.71 million in contingencies. These
costs are inchrred for imported machinery and equipment, spares
and materials, foreign technical assistance, and training. They
would be covered by a mix of Swiss grant funds and IDA financing
to be provided to RGOB which, in turn, provides (i) US$0.60 of
this foreign exchange amount (including contingencies) to FD for
implementing the Forest and Pest Management Component, and (ii)
US$7.96 million (including contingencies) to BLC for
implementing the other components under the project.
(b)  Total local costs (in Bhutanese and Indian currencies) of Nu
284.11 million (US$22.73 million equivalent), comprising
Nu 49.89 million in investments, Nu 192.86 million in
incremental operating costs and Nu 41.36 million in
contingencies. Of the total costs of Nu 284.11 million
(including contingencies), Nu 282.75 million would be
incurred by BLC and Nu 1.38 million by FD. No foreign financing
is anticipated for these local costs, which include salaries,
labor, materials, payments to local contractors, and equipment
and stores that can be bought in India. Local costs include
total staff salaries, which have been included in the financial
analysis and indicate RGOB/BLC's total budgetary implications.
A number of existing staff would be redeployed with some
retraining. Incremental staff are indicated in para 6.09 and
Table 6.1 below.

D. Financing Plan
5.27    Foreign financing is expected to cover 1007 of the foreign exchange
costs and no local cost of the project. This wou'd amount to US$8.56 million
(Nu 107.0 million), of which US$7.00 million is Lor investment costs, and
US$1.56 million for incremental operating costs, comprising mainly spares and
imported materials. The tentative project financing plan is presented in
Table 5.3.

- 30 -
financed under the present project (Table 5.3 above). The Swiss-financed
portion would be administered by IDA and would follow Bank Group's guidelines
for procurement and recruitment of consultants.
E. FinancLma Arrangements for FD and BLC
5.28    The projected financing arrangements are based on three main
considerations:
(a) Foreign borrowings in hard currency by R6OB are kept to a
minimum and essentially cover the foreign exchange portion of
project costs only;
(b) Most of the foreign borrowings are onlent to BLC, which is
treated as a comercial entity, is expected to repay loans it
receives at commercial interest rates, and to bear its
production and overhead costs from the revenue it generates; and
(c)  RGOB's budgetary burden resulting from this proJ'ct is kept to
an absolute minimum, and covers only the costs (both foreign and
local) incurred on the Forest and Pest Management component to
be implemented by the FD.
Forest Department
5.29    Funds for the PD's component will be passed on from R1OB to FD, which
is a Government department established under general budgetary rules.
Following normal practice, budgetary allocations to ID would be made via a
local Operating Account (in RGOB's terminology, a 'Letter of Credit Account")
in local currency, equivalent to three months' share of RGOB's project
expenditures for the current year.
BLC
5.30    Funds for the foreign exchange costs of BLC's components would be
provided to RGOB which on-lends them to BLC. The subsidiary loan would be
denominated in US dollars, with BLC bearing the foreign exchange risk. RGOB's
budgetary burden would only amount to the ID's portion of US$0.7 million (Nu
8.9 million) since BLC's projected cash flows based on conservative
production, sales, and price estimates indicate that BLC would be able to meet
its expenditures and initial loan for the foreign exchange portion of
investment costs out of its own present and future resources (see Annex 3:
Profit and Loss Account and Balance Sheet, with Project). Zotal investments
by BLC under the project would be Nu 125.9 million (US$10.1 million). BLC's
cash flow also indicates that it would have no difficulty in sustaining a
subsidiary loan from RGOB for the foreign exchange portion of investment and
incremental operating costs at an interest rate of 122 per annum, payable
after two years' grace on the principal, in annual installments from 1990 ever
seven years. The rate of 12Z por annum reflects commercial lending rates and



- 31 -
is positive in real terms, annual inflation rate in Bhutan being estimated at
around 10. These terms are proposed for the onlending arrangements from RGOB
to BLC and would be incorporated in a Subsidiary Loan Agreement to be signed
between these parties, which would be a condition of effectiveness. These
proposed rates would be reviewed from time to time by RGOB as indicated in the
Operational Action Plan (Annex 9).
5.31    Most of the foreign exchange payments would be for equipment, payment
of foreign experts, and overseas training, and would be drawn from RGOB's IDA
loan/GSC grant account according to IDA procedures. This account covers (a)
the FD portion, and (b) BLC portion. For (b), any payments effected by IDA on
receipt of withdrawal applications from BLC would be recorded against RGOB's
loan/grant account. BLC should simultaneously record these payments under its
subsidiary loan account with RGOB, accrue interest as appropriate, and
commence repayment according to the terms proposed above.
5.32    In this regard, the funds (US$2.5 million) allocated under the ongoin;
IDA-assisted Forestry Development Project (Credit 1460-BHU) for technical
assistance and the purchase of equipment urgently required in areas to be
covered by the integrated pest management program would also be on-lent from
RGOB to BLC under an arrangement similar to the terms of the Subsidiary Loan
Agreement between RGOB and BLC, proposed in para 5.30.
5.33    Besides capital inflows, BLC would require short-term working capital.
However, apart from the Bank of Bhutan, no well-organized system of short-term
industrial credit is available in Bhutan. Therefore, RGOB may have to provide
some short-term loan to BLC in the first year of the pro'ect. MrOB should
monitor BLC's debt situation closely. At neaotiations, agreement was reached
with BLC that it would ensure that its long-term debt would not exceed its
equity.
F. Procurement
5.34    The total procurements expected to be made by both 3LC and FD (by
procurement method) are indicated in Table 5.4. All figures include
contingencies. For all ICB items, prior review by IDA would be required.

Goods
5.35    The total cost of goods to be procured would be approximately US$13.89
million, including price and physical contingencies. International
Competitive Bidding (ICB) procedures would be used to procure US$5.37 million
(or 392) of the goods, Local Competitive Bidding (LCB) to procure US$3.82
million (or 272), and Other Methods to procure US$4.70 million (or 34?).



- 33 -
5.36    All goods to be procured under ICB procedures would be grouped into
two packages and let to bid under procedures acceptable to IDA. The first
package has already been reviewed by IDA and bids are being solicited. The
second package is scheduled to be opened for bid in mid-1988, and it too would
be subject to the IDA's prior review. The normal 15X preference or applicable
import duties, whichever is lower, would be allowed local suppliers in bid
evaluation on all ICB.
5.37    Equipment and materials (including spares), estimated to cost
US$50,0000 or less per contract and not exceeding US$ 1.65 million in the
aggregate would be financed by IDA and GSC and procured through the
Government's normal LCB procedures. These procedures allow for foreign
competition and have been found to be efficient, economical, result in
reasonable prices, and are acceptable to IDA.
5.38    The local cost portion of O&M and recurrent costs (US$4.70 million)
would also be procured through normal governmental practices, whtich have been
found to produce reasonable prices. The goods procured under 'Other"
procedures would not be financed by IDA, nor would the associated procurement
actions be subject to IDA review.
Works
5.39    All works are expected to be accomplished by departmental forces and
therefore no works contracts would be awarded. The total cost of local labor
that would be needed to support the project is estimated to be US$15.30
million; of that amount, approximately US$2.48 million would finance payroll
employees and US$12.82 million would be required to finance contractual
employees. Contractual employees would generally be individuals or small
groups of individuals employed through the use of short-term piece work
contracts. All labor would be funded from the local-financed portion of
project costs, by RGOB in the case of FD, and by BLC for the rest.
G. Disbursements
5.40    Disbursements under the IDA Credits (which include Credit 1460-BHU and
the Present Project) would be for 100? of foreign expenditures for vehicles
(US$0.31 million); equipment (US$2.44 million); and materials including
spares, etc., for road construction, vehicle and equipment OWM costs (US$0.81
million); for a total of US$3.56 million. (GSC disbursements are for
categories indicated in Table 5.3 above.) Contracts for vehicles, equipment
and materials for US$50,000 equivalent and more would be fully documented, but
contracts for less than the equivalent of US$50,000 (with the exception of
technical assistance and overseas training) would be reimbursed against
Statements of Expenditures certified by the Project Manager. The relevant
supporting documentation would be retained by the implementing agency and made
available to IDA representatives for review upon request.



- 34 -
5.41    In order to facilitate disbursements, a Special Account for IDA in the
amount of US$90,000 equivalent would be established with the Bank of Bhutan
and would cover the categories funded by IDA (Annex 3, Table 1). Funds from
this Accunt would be withdrawn in proportion to the percentage being financed.
No disbursements profile has been evolved for Bhutan. An indicative
disbursements schedule is shown in Annex 3, Table 3. The estimated closing
date is December 31, 1993.
VI. ORGANIZATION AND MANAGEMENT
A. Proiect Organization
6.01    The project would be implemented by two closely related agenciest the
BLC and PD. All BLC staff were transferred from PD at the time BLC was formed
in 1974; staff of both agencies have retained the same grades and salaries,
and are transferable between the two agencies. The Director General (DG) of
Forests is also the Chairman of BLC. In BLC, the DG is de facto the Chief
Executive. and all major decisions regarding operating policies and procedures
and key personnel appointments are subject to Iis approval. In view of the
functions assigned to each agency under the Forest Act and the BLC Charter,
the activities of the proposed project would be implemented as followst BLC
would undertake logging, nursery works and reforestation, road construction,
operation of workshop facilities, and marketing and would improve its
financial management system. FD would undertake the pest and forest
management component. Chart 1 shows the existing organization of PD. Chart 2
shows the proposed BLC organization under the project. Chart 3 shows the
proposed organization of BLC at the divisional levels.
Forest Department
6.02    FD is headed by the Director General and a Joint Director at
headquarters who oversees headquarters, three territorial (regional)
divisions, and seven functional divisions. The latter divisions are
responsible for Forestry Demarcation, Research, Bhutan Forestry Institute,
Southern and Northern Wildlife Circles, Afforestation (in charge of the first
IDA-assisted Forestry project), and Management (see Chart l Organization
Chart-Forest Department).
6.03    Tho Pest and Forest Management component would be supervised by the
Research and Management Divisions, respectively. Pest management is currently
handled by a forest ranger in the Research Division working with FAO
consultants. In view of the seriousness of the current pest outbreak, it has
been agreed that the head of the Research Division should be directly involved
in the implementation of the program. He would also be assisted by one
additional ranger (as Deputy DPO) and two foreaters who would be trained to
supervise survey work and other control measures in the field. These officers
would also o rganize extension efforts to promote greater awareness and
understanding of the pest management measures to be implemented under the



- :5 -
program among other field officers (both FD and BLC) as well as villagers. The
consultant entomologist would be attached to the Research Division and would
help to undertake the required studies and plan the pest management strategy.
The consultant field silviculturist would be attached to and would assist the
Management Division to plan and evaluate various silvicultural options for the
pest-attacked areas and train the marking crews in the field.
6.04    The Management Division would take the lead in ensuring that BLC's
logging and replanting operations are fully integrated with the pest control
measures devised by the Research Division. It would develop appropriate
cutting prescriptions and silvicultural techniques aimed at promoting maximum
natural regeneration. At least once a year, Management Division would
instruct BLC regarding the cutting area priorities for the next period with
reference to a master forest management plan for the region. The territorial
DFO should also be informed of these decisions as he is also responsible for
checking that log production conforms to management and operating plan
specifications. The Management Division would require four additional
foresters (working in pairs) to do the marking on priority areas in a timely
manner. under the supervision of the field silviculturist. At negotiations,
aireement was reached that by November 30 of each year, the Management
Division of PD would instruct BLC regarding cutting area priorities for the
next year. Agreement was also reached that by April 30, 1988, FD would
appoint four additional foresters as markers.
BLC
6.05    Under the Charter of 1984, BLC was to be supervised by a Board of
Directors. In February 1986 this Board was dissolved by Royal edict and the
powers of the Board vested solely in its Chairman, who is also the Director
General of FD. It is anticipated that the Chairman would appoint technical
advisors from outside PD and BLC, who would be invited to visit the project
activities periodically, and to offer their suggestions for improving BLC's
operations. The Managing Director (MD) reports directly to the Chairman.
Under the MD is an Assistant MD, and the Accounts, Administration, Marketing,
and Engineering Divisions at headquarters. The total staff at headquarters is
15, including 10 clerical and junior staff. The field operations are handled
by the logging divisions, each headed by a Divisional Forest Officer (DFO).
Wangchu Division (corresponding to Thimphu District) is the largest, with 50
staff, while Paro, Haa, and Gaylegphug each have 38, 28, and 14 staff,
respectively, giving a total of 130 staff in the four logging divisions.
Smaller divisions exist in Bumthang, Samdrup Jongkar, Sarbhang, Samchi, and
Gedu.
6.06    The two new divisions created in 1987 are the Marketing and
Engineering Divisions. The Marketing Division has handled all sales since
January 1987; it is headed by a DPO who supervises all auction and negotiated
sales and timber sawn at private sawmills on a contractual basis. The
Engineering Division is headed by a DPO who is responsible for undertaking the
preharvest inventory and designing the detailed logging and road layout in
advance of each year's logging activities. The increased work program under
the project will make it necessary for him to have detailed maps of the



- 36 -
terrain; otherwise he would have to develop the needed information from
extensive ground surveys at much greater cost and delay. The Engineering
Division should specify standards for the construction and maintenance of
forest roads. Under the project, the Engineering DFO would report to the
Assistant MD, who would be designated the Logging Director in view of the
vastly increased logging program under the proposed project. The Logging
Director would also be responsible for supervising of the Paro workshop.
6.07    In the pest-attacked areas, it is imperative to maintain proper forest
hygiene and control over logging operations as part of the integrated pest
control program. To enable this, RGOB has granted BLC exclusive rights for
logging and protection in the areas assigned to it within the forest
management plans developed by PD. In addition, BLC would also undertake to
supply, from its fellings, institutional and local villagers' wood
requirements, at Government established rates, in the vicinity of the areas in
which it operates. Amendments have also been made to BLC's Charter to enable
it to borrow funds and carry out reforestation.
6.08    Staff.  Because of the beetle attack, most of BLC's staff have been
transferred to the project area and have already been logging in these areas
with existing equipment. In general, these staff are reasonably well-trained
and have graduated from the Forestry Training School at Taba as well as the
HELVETAS-funded training school at Lame Gompa. With some additional training,
the staff and equipment operators should be able to handle the techniques and
equipment proposed under the project without too much difficulty. Under the
project, mechanics and equipment operators would be trained to operate,
service, and maintain the proposed new equipment and facilities. In addition
to daily wages, the cost estimates include a production bonus to be paid to
the operators and yarding crews. These crews should be put on a full contract
basis as soon as they become fully trained in the new system of clear-cutting
and BLC has enough cost experience. This would ensure that the machinery is
used to its fullest capacity, minimizing overall cost. In general, the
workers should earn about 502 more than their present daily rate.
6.09    Under the proposed project, BLC would be responsible for nursery works
and reforestation of the areas logged under the integrated pest management
program within the project area. The incremental staff requirements are 1
DFO, 3 rangers, 6 foresters and 12 forest guards. Three rangers would be
responsible for reforestation and protection under the supervision of the
logging DFOs. Each ranger would be assisted by two foresters and four forest
guards. One forester would be in charge of the nursery, seed collection, and
fire protection. The other would be in charge of survey, mapping, planting,
and general plantation protection (see the Supplementary Volume, Annex 3 on
Reforestation and Forest Management Component, and Organization Charts for
details). The organization of staff to implement the other components are
described in detail in the other Annexes in the Supplementary Volume.
6.10    Most of the fieldwork would be done by daily wage labor; at peak
operation periods, between 60-90 laborers would be required for the nurseries
and 150 for plantation and protection. Laborers for reforestation and
protection are expected to come primarily from India or Nepal and would be



- 37 -
employed on short-term contracts. It is expected that in addition to the
daily wages paid by PD and BLC, they would receive daily food rations
sponsored by the World Food Program (WFP), as is the case under the First
Forestry Project. This incentive payment has been found useful in retaining
experienced laborers on project works. RGOB/BLC would seek WFP support for
this activity throughout the project period.
6.11    Incremental Staff.  The incremental staff requirements are given in
Table 6.1. At present, FD has 782 staff, 19 of whom are at a higher level
(Assistant Director and above), 11 are officers at headquarters, and 752 are
in the functional, territorial, and administrative divisions. FD would
require seven additional staff. BLC has 165 staff, 15 of whom are officers at
headquarters, 20 are staff in the Marketing (Timber Disposal) Division, and
130 are of DFO rank and below in the logging divisions. Under the project, a
number of existing staff would be redeployed into new jobs and given on-the-
Job training. The incremental requirements for skilled staff are modest,
given the existing staff strength and the scale of project activities, and it
should be possible to recruit these people during the project period. The
additional 141 semi-skilled staff (technicians) required by BLC include: (a)
46 additional equipment operators, mainly power saw operators who can be
trained at the Bumthang Forestry School at Lame Gompa (which has a capacity of
36 per year) and on the job, within 3-6 months; (b) 23 mechanics,
electricians, etc., who would be trained on the job and in the workshops
(selected mechanics will also be sent for periodic training in India to update
their skills in repairing particular machines or components); and (c) 72
loggers who would be recruited from over 300 trained at the Bumthang Forestry
School since its inception (this school has the capacity to train 60 loggers
per year). Most of the ex-trainees are at present working in other sectors as
most of the logging to date has been done manually and no skilled jobs were
available. The project staff would attempt to locate these people and offer
them employment and refresher training.

6.12   Field ODerations.  In the three project districts, BLC's logging
equipment is inadequate, so that most of the work is being performed manually.
In logging, the present low output of the long cable cranes is caused by the
long rigging-up times and excessive downtime due to lack of spares and repair
facilities. Manual work is done on a piece-rate contract basis, with BLC
paying a fixed rate per ft3 (Hoppus), depending on the distance the logs must
be rolled to the road. Felling, crosscutting, and debarking are also done on
a contract basis; BLC has introduced some chainsaws, with the operator paying
for the saw on a unit-of-production basis. The project would provide for
enough power saws to do all the felling and bucking. Th..s would require less
manpower and help improve the recovery per ha as the stumps presently left by
the ranual fellers are very high.
6.13   All loading of logs would be done with hydraulic grapple loaders
mounted on the back of a new 6 x 6, 8-ton truck. This would allow the
contract truckers to make more trips per day to the log yards. Also, if market
demand dictates, longer lengths could be produced, and these would reduce
logging costs. There is no apparent shortage of contract trucks, although the
trucks presently being used are general cargo trucks that are not particularly
suited for hauling logs. BLC would continue to be responsible for operating
log depots and for handling all log sales. It is considering longer-term
contracts as an incentive for truckers to invest in better-equipped and
designed, and possibly heavier trucks (e.g., 10-12 tons, rather than 6-8
tons), and other equipment for haulage.
6.14   The road construction program, for which BLC is also responsible has
been curtailed in the past by delays in acquiring explosives through the



- 39 -
Public Works Department (PWD) and the State Trading Corporation of Bhutan
(STC5). The road maintenance program has also been handicapped by excessive
reliance on manual techniques. As a result, road surfaces are uneven and
require even more maintenance, which can only be carried out on an irregular
basis, given the shortage of labor. The project provides equipment and
vehicles for a construction unit in each of the three project districts, each
of which would be under the charge of a Roads Supervisor. BLC has agreed to
arrange more expedient procuremen. of the explosives needed by procuring
directly through the STCB, instead of ordering through PWD, which then
resubmitc its combined requirements to STCB.
6.15    Under the reforestation program, site-specific strategies will have to
be devised to ensure that there will be no damage to the plantations or
adverse displacement of the graziers and their animals. One year in advance
of plantation activities, the Management Division of FD, in consultation with
BLC, will prepare the proposed operational plan for the site and advise the
concerned Territorial DPO of the proposed sites for replanting. Territorial
staff will then collect information regarding the existing grazing situation
as a background to discussions with the Dzongdag (District Administrator, Home
Ministry) and local people. The Dzongdag will initiate discussions among the
Forest Department, local headmen (Gups), and herders who may use the area for
grazing on a full-time or seasonal basis. Potential problems created by the
need to protect the new plantations, and alternative arrangements will be
discussed. Because of the difficulty of contacting both migratory cattle
herders and nomadic yak herders at the same time, discussions are best held
during the spring or fall, allowing adequate time between formal meetings for
proper deliberation of the alternatives. The Dzongdag will convene a second
meeting to discuss concrete proposals and draft satisfactory agreements
between FD and the concerned villagers. BLC's program will then be finalized
on the basis of these agreements. The Dzongdags will have the responsibility
both of ensuring that the written agreements are satisfactory to all parties
and that FD and BLC harvesting and reforestation activities are fully
discussed with local inhabitants.
Proiect Coordination
6.16    Since the project is largely implemented by BLC, the Managing Director
of BLC would also be the Project Coordinator (PC). The PC would ensure, at
all times, that project actions accord with, and receive support from existing
operations carried out by BLC and FD. Thus, for instance, BLC's logging plans
should dovetail with the working plans of FD's Management Division; BLC's
reforestation program should closely follow and offset its logging program
under the project; and technical assistance to FD under ongoing FAOIUNDP
projects should be tapped and utilized during project implementation. For
this, the PC, helped by the Logging Management Consultant, should liase
closely with the Chief Technical Advisor of project BHU/85/016, in particular.
6.17    Some instances in which project activities should be coordinated with
the work of other related organizations are as followst BLC's road
construction program should be checked against that of PWD; the procurement of
supplies and materials should be coordinated through the Planning Commission



- 40 -
(for ICB items), STCB (for locally procured items), Bank of Bhutan (for
issuance of letters of credit), and RGOB's Customs Department at Calcutta to
facilitate smooth transit of goods into Bhutan. Timber-marketing strategy
should be evolved with agencies such as the Export Division of the STCB and
the Ministry of Trade and Industries. The project's funding needs should be
fully reflected in the current development plans and annual national budget,
and timely budgetary allocations and reimbursement procedures should be worked
out with the Pinance Ministry. The PC should also ensure that project accounts
are properly maintained and timely audits performed by the Royal Auditor
General.
Role of Private Contractors
6.18    All logging in Bhutan was taken over by the RGOB in 1979 and placed
under the direction of BLC as recently as 1984, with the result that there has
not been time for local private logging contractors to develop a significant
trade. Most of the felling, debarking, and yarding is presently done on
piece-rate basis. All hauling is done by small contractors, but since they
are only given a one-year contract, most of them do not have the incentive to
purchase suitable equipment designed specifically for hauling logs. BLC has
attempted to build roads by contract, but this has met with limited success as
most of the contractors did not have appropriate equipment and were
inexperienced.
6.19    It is anticipated that BLC would alter its present policy of one-year
hauling contracts to provide five-year contracts (with an annual review
clause) so that truckers will have the necessary incentive to purchase trucks
especially equipped for hauling logs (see also para 6.13). BLC could also
foster the growth of local private contractors by selling or financing
equipment te, trained employees who have demonstrated the desire and ability to
be good entrepreneurs, although this may happen only very gradually.
B. Financial Management
6.20    This section focusses mainly on BLC's situation, since the FD follows
government accounting procedures, which were found to be largely satisfactory.
BLC accounts are kept separately and also appear to follow government
accounting procedures, even though commercial accounting practices and record-
keeping should be followed.
Accounting System
6.21    The Accounts Division of BLC requires considerable strengthening as it
has not been growing commensu.ately with the increased volume of business that
BLC handles nor is it developing in ways that would assist commercial
decision-making. At present, BLC's accounting and record-keeping system is
not fully susceptible to internal controls, cost accounting, or proper
commercial auditing. Budgetary control is not practised on a regular basis
and is difficult to carry out with the existing records. There is no system



- 41 -
of finncial reporting apart from basic records of receipts and cash payments.
A system is needed whereby accounts are kept on an accrual basis and
maintained on a double-entry basis. Cost accounting should be established,
inventories maintained by locality, and cash flows properly managed to enable
predictions of sales and collections made so as to avoid liquidity problems.
6.22    Because of the increased complexity and volume of accounting work
envisaged under the project, two additional accountants would be required at
headquarters, the accounts procedures between headquarters and the divisional
offices should be simplified and streamlined, and divisional accountants
should be trained in the new procedures. RGOB has also agreed to provide the
services of a suitably qualified financial accountant (presently attached to
RAA) to assist with streamlining BLC's accounting and record-keeping
procedures in line with the new financial guidelines set by the Finance
Ministry. This input would cover the period before project start-up and
should start the process of improving the current system. RGOB (RAM)'s
consultant would submit a report on his findings as a basis for work to be
done during the project period on improving BLC's accounting system. The
project provides for four man-months of a financial management consultant, in
two periods of two months each, to continue this process. The consultant
would train BLC accountants; set up the procedures for information flow,
compilation, reporting and review; and complete a simple manual on the
subject. Besides providing a sound basis for effective audit, the improved
accounting system would also facilitate good cash management, assist fund flow
planning, and provide more meaningful analyses of financial statements for
review by the BLC management. Two additional accountants have been recruited
at BLC headquarters to help implement the system.
Financial Position of BLC
6.23    BLC's Profit-and-Loss Account and Balance Sheet for the years 1985 and
1986 and projected figures from 1987 are shown in Annex 3, Tables 1 and 2. .f
In 1985 and 1986, BLC produced 46,000 and 115,000 m3 of timber respectively
and generated total revenues of Nu 25.0 and 50.6 million. After deduction of
royalties, production, administration, and other charges, BLC's pre-tax
profits amounted to Nu 2.1 and 8.0 million in 1985 and 1986. PLC is subject
to Corporation tax at 301 of its profits; after tax, BLC's net income amounted
to Nu 1.5 million in 1985 and Nu 5.6 million in 1986.
6.24    As of December 1986, BLC's accumulated total assets were about Nu 40.2
million, including Nu 13.6 million in fixed assets (mainly equipment,
vehicles, and forest roads constructed), the balance being current assets. The
most significant item in BLC's current assets is the undisposed inventories of
timber at year-end, which are equivalent to about one year's production. This
was largely due to uncertainties as to which government agency (BLC or Export
Development Corporation) was to be in charge of timber exports, and also to
inadequate roads and transport bottlenecks. ROOB has since decided that BLC
should handle timber exports. In addition, since one of the major project
components is forest road construction, the transportation situation should
Improve, so that year-end inventories will begin to decline from 1988 on.

6.25    BLC was established with a share capital of Nu 10.0 million.  Capital
reserves, grant funds, and retained earnings have added Nu 11.9 million to its
equity funds, which amounted to Nu 21.9 million by December 1986. There are
no long-term borrowings. BLC's current liabilities (Nu 18.3 million at
December 1986) consist mainly of royalties and taxes due to RGOB and deposits
from its customers/contractors. Except for the slow-moving inventories
mentioned above and the resulting liquidity problems in its overall finances,
BLC's overall financial position is generally satisfactory and BLC should be
able to carry the long-term borrowings foreseen under the project.
C. Audit
6.26    Bhutan's audit requirements are looked after solely by the Royal
Auditor General, who performs audits annually, and usually at the end of each
fiscal year (March 31).  The audit arrangements of the office of the Auditor
General were found to be largely satisfactory. The audits pertaining to BLC
financial statements should include certification of profit-and-loss accounts
and balance sheets of BLC, as well as certification that IDA (and GSC)
reimbursements directly or against statements of expenditure have been for
eligible categories of expenditure. Both PD and BLC would maintain records of
project expenditures, including separate records for items disbursed on
statements of expenditure. All records of expenditures, deliveries, and
payments should be retained until one year after the Closing Date and made
available for inspection by IDA. The books of accounts of these agencies
would be audited annually by the Auditor General of Bhutan, or by independent
auditors acceptable to IDA, in accordance with sound auditing principles. At
negotiations. agreement was reached that certified copies of annual audit
reports as well as audit opinion on statements of expenditure, together with
financial statements, would be sent to IDA within six months after the close
of each fiscal year.
D. Review and Reporting
6.27    The Project Coordinator (PC) and his staff are responsible for
detailed monitoring and supervision of project activities and ensuring good
and timely coordination between the implementing agencies. Semi-annual
reports on the physical and financial progress achieved and outstanding
problems covering up to December 31 and June 30 each year, should be furnished
by BLC and PD to the PC every April and October. Such reports should be
checked and consolidated by the PC and forwarded to IDA by every March 31 and
September 30. The PC's report should cover progress on the implementation of
each project component according to an Action Plan, including an updated
review of the status of compliance with project covenants and other agreed
actions as discussed with preceding supervision missions. The PC would also
prepare and forward to IDA a midterm review report no later than September 30,
1990, and an evaluation of the project no later than six months after Project
Closing.



- 43 -
6.28    At negotiations, agreement was reached that the PC would submit
progress to IDA reports by every March 31 and September 30; a midterm review
report by September 30, 1990; and a project completion report no later than
six months after Project Closing. The midterm review report would form the
basis for a Midterm Review with the donors. Aareement was also reached that
the Midterm Review would be carried out by December 31, 1990 by RGOB, BLC,
IDA, and GSC. This review would assess the technical achievements of the
various project components and Introduce any changes required to help achieve
project objectives.
E. Review and Coordination among Donors
6.29    To make the bes. use of available resources, the project would use
twelve man-months of technical assistance (Forestry and Plantation Specialist)
and about US$16,100 equivalent of equipment provided under the UNDPIFAO
project (BHU/85/016). Details of these inputs have been formalized between
IDA, GSC, RGOB, and UNDP/FAO by an exchange of letters between the parties
concerned.
6.30    The project wrould be supervised by IDA about once every six months. To
the extent possible, these supervision visits to Bhutan would be planned to
coincide with the semi-annual reviews of the UNDPIPAO project (BHU/851016),
and with the reviews by GSCISDC of the Integrated Forestry Project at
Bumthang/Kothoka, which it supports. This timing would facilitate maximum
coordination among tf- various donors and exchange of information about
project and forestry -lated issues, especially those relating to (a)
training; (b) research and development in silviculture, engineering, cost
accounting, and financial management; tc) design of monitoring and evaluation
Zsystem; (d) review and modifications, as required, to project design and
implementation schedules; and (e) transfers of project staff. At
negotiations, agreement was reached that the Planning Commission would
organize such a joint review meeting of forestry projects to be held in
conjunction with these visits, and at least once every year, attended by
representatives of BLC and FD and the donors.
F. Coordination with Other AQencies in the Forest Sector
6.31    To improve coordination between the various agencies supporting the
forestry sector, a general one- to two-day workshop on all forestry-related
projects would be held in Thimphu once a year. Such a workshop, organized by
RGOB, would be extremely useful to assess the forest situation and impact of
government policy on developments in the wood-based sector. Participants
would be drawn from the project managerial level and could include
representatives of the IDA-assisted First and Second Forestry Projects,
various UNDP/FAO forestry projects, the Integrated Forestry Development
project (IFDP) at Bumthang, the Gedu Wood Manufacturing Corporation, the UNIDO



- 44 -
Wooden Bridge project, as well as local wood industries. The objectives of
the workshop would be to review progress on the various forestry projects;
discuss matters of common concern, or those that could benefit from
coordination of respective project activities or sharing of facilities;
monitor forest policy and related wood-based industry developments in the
country, especially where it affects their own growth; and offer RGOB guidance
for policy decisions. This annual workshop should be coordinated by the
Ministry of Agriculture and timed, as far as possible, with the review meeting
in the preceding paragraph. At nraotiations. agreement was reached that RGOB
would hold such a workshop annually.
G. Status of Prolect Preparation
6.32    The detailed plan of activities and implementation schedule for both
FD and BLC has been been agreed on at negotiations (Annexes 8 and 9). The
training and technical assistance requirements have been identified in detail
and terms of reference prepared for all the assignments (Annex 5, 6 and 7).
Start-up operations in the project area will be funded under the First
Forestry Development Project (Cr. 1460-BHU) which was recently amended for
this purpose. ROOB has made the required amendments to the Charter of BLC
(para 6.07). UNDP and FAO have accepted IDA's declaration of 'Special
Interest' in project BHU/85/016, regarding the complementary technical
assistance and equipment inputs which that project would provide, and make
available during the implementation of the Forestry II ptoject (para 6.29).
On the individual compone2ts, good progress has been made on the development
of standardized attractants for field applications under the pest management
program (para 5.06). RGOB has received from Government of India most of the
maps of the project area in time for project start-up; the remaining maps will
be delivered by June 30, 1988 (para 5.12). A nursery consultant, recruited
under UNDP/FAO ProJect BHU/83/022 is now assisting with the final choice of
nursery sites in the project area, initiating equipment procurement, and
training staff in nursery organization (para 5.15). The Animal Husbandry
Department has already completed studies of grazing requirements in parts of
the project area with the help of FAO TCt consultants (para 6.15). Trial log
grading, sawmill recovery studies, and auctions of lumber sawn to trial
specifications have been initiated b7 BLC's Marketing Division and results of
these studies would provide guidance for evolving a suitable marketing
strategy (para 5.23). RGOB has provided a financial consultant to BLC to
devise an improved accounting system for BLC (para 5.24). BLC has recruited
two additional accountants (para 6.22).

VII. PRODUCTION. MARKETING. MM PRICES
A. Yields and Production
7.01    The total forested area in the pest-infected catchments of the project
districts covers 11,000 ha. The integrated pest management program would reed
to treat a total of 2,640 ha, of which some 740 ha of healthy stands would be
left in place and 1,900 ha would be salvaged and subsequently regenerated.
The natural coniferous forests have gross standing volumes of 300-500 m3 per
ha or more and are capable of yielding up to 150,000 m3 annually over the
project period. The project would enable BLC to build up enough capacity to
harvest these volumes, although project output has been taken conservatively
at 97,000 m3 in 1988, 125,000 m3 in 1989, and rising to 130,000 m3 thereafter.
These predicted output levels can be sustained, assuming a number of
concurrent developments, namelys (a) the development of a suitable
mechanization strategy (and of requisite skills), which would alleviate the
labor shortage by reducing the need for imported labor and increasing
productivity; and (b) a systematic program of building forest roads into
strategic locations to gain access into otherwise inaccessible locations for
implementing the pest control measures and logging and reforestation programs.
These concurrent measures are provided for under the project.
7.02    Existing levels of production using largely manual methods totaled
46,000 m3 in 1985 and an estimated 115,000 m3 in 1986, although about 55? of
this remained as woods inventory and was not removed from forest sites. This
was due in part to the difficult terrain and in part to the controversy as to
which agency should be responsible for timber exports. The prediction for
1987 was that before the arrival of the new machinery to be procured under the
revised allocations under the First Forestry Project, only about 60,000 m3
could be harvested, as the areas most easily accessible from existing roads
had been fairly well logged.
7.03    Besides improving the access of the areas to be treated, the project
would help increase the efficiency of wood extraction and the recovery per ha.
At present, there is considerable wastage as the manual fellers leave very
high stumps. The project would provide enough chainsaws to do the felling and
bucking. The proposed use of cable cranes, tower yarders, and skidders would
also make it possible to ewract longer lengths of logs, for which some users
would pay price premiums; at present these preferences are impossible to meet
since most logs are rolled out of the forest and down the steep slopes
manually (causing considerable environmental damage), and longer lengths would
impede movement considerably.
7.04    Under the project, it would also be possible to fell and extract pest-
infected timber before it deteriorates excessively and becomes uneconomical to
harvest; log quality would be preserved and a number of measures (such as
water sprinkling and possibly submergence of the logs in log ponds) could be
tested both to hinder the development and hatching of the pest and to preserve
the freshness of the logs. These measures are described in greater detail in



- 46 -
Annex 2 (OManagement of Spruce Bark Beetle Populations in Western Bhutan") in
the Supplementary Volume, which accompanies this report.
B. Marketina
7.05    The record of export sales of Bl.utanese timber indicates  that
production is considerably lower than demand, particularly that from
neighboring India where chronic shortage of timber has been exacerbated by
government policies to conserve the forests and restrict falling in watershed
areas.  Statistics of the sawmilling industry in India indicate annual
savmilling capacity of 27 million m , log availability of 13 million m3,
annual sawn output of 9 million i3, and potential shortfall of supply of at
least 10 million m3 sawnvood (or 15 million m3 equivalent of logs). The scale
of the trade is enormous and indicates that there will be no difficulty for
BLC to sell an estimated annual 0.13 million m3 of its high quality timber to
India. Bhutanese timber is already sold to buyers as far afield as Bombay and
Madras.  A survey of the sawmilling capacity in four main centers handling
coniferous timber close to Bhutan (Kirti Nagar, Yamuna Nagar  Jammu, and
Siliguri) indicates annual sawmill capacity of 0.9 million ;i per year with
substantial underutilization and a number of firms switching to other
businesses due to shortage of raw material. Buyers are familiar with
Bhutanese timber and are paying up to Rs 1,750/im3 for logs from Bhutan. Some
users In Meghalaya report paying double that price for well-sawn baulks from
Uttar Pradesh and Jamvu and Kashmir. Market competition is very keen and the
prices are competitive as there are many buyers for Bhutanese timber. The
survey concludes that Bhutanese timbers find a ready market in India; that the
market will take any quality, but that prices will have to le negotiated
carefully; that considerable added value can be gained from careful milling,
drying and grading; and that the overall trend shows a steady increase in
prices for logs and sawn products.
7.06    Under the project, BLC would continue to be responsible for (a) the
sale of logs, as well as (b) providing the sawnwood requirements of local
users. BLC currently sells most of the logs at auctions, mainly to Indian
buyers or their agents, or at negotiated sales in the case of remnant batches.
Auction prices have been high owing to the acute scarcity of timber and the
ban on logging in neighboring India, the fact that India levies no duties on
timber from Bhutan, and that Bhutan accepts rupee payments for these
purchases. Although recognized as a real advantage, the 'rupee advantage"
should not be counted on indefinitely, as other major producers (particularly
USA, New Zealand, USSR, etc.) are now able to deliver quality timber to
Calcutta at extremely competitive prices (about Rs 1,220/i3 for logs and up to
Rs 2,310/m3 for stress-graded sawnwood), and foreign currency appears to be
increasingly made available in India for necessary timber imports. Project
actions that are designed to improve the quality, presentation, and
dependability of delivery of Bhutanese timber products are therefore extremely
timely and necessary for the long-term development of the industry. More
direct sales by BLC to major users are anticipated; this will eliminate
numerous middlemen currently involved in merchanting, and increase the profits



- 47 -
to BLC. Current marketing practices and the market for conifers in India are
described in detail in the Supplementary Volume, Annex 4.
7.07    The domestic sawnwood requirements of housebuilders and Government
construction needs (Dzongs, schools, dispensaries, bridges, barracks, and so
on) are supplied by BLC, as instructed by RGOB, at concessionary prices. More
recently, the decision to give BLC monopoly over the supply of such timber
stemmed from the need to minimize private felling, which has is the past been
found wasteful and destructive, and is thought to have contributed to the
unhygienic forest conditions which are conducive to the spread of the bark
beetle epidemic. BLC supplies logs to the private sawmills for sawing at
contract rates and then sells the sawnwood to the intended beneficiaries. A
limited quantity of sawnwood is exported to India. Both BLC and the
Department of Trade and Industries have made little effort to supervise this
work or to provide guidance on product specification, with the result that
sawmill recoveries are low and the products poorly sawn. The sawmills
currently lack any incentive to improve their techniques and tools or to
produce more efficiently since the BLC contracts offer them steady incomes and
impose no penalty for inefficiency. The project would provide technical
assistance in sawmilling and sawdoctoring. It also anticipates arrangements
made with the Gedu woodprocessing facility at Phuntsholing to produce well-
sawn batches for trial auctions to detci:mine the market's response to a better
product. The project would also provide BLC staff and sawmillers
opportunities for training and study tours to visit successful operations in
neighboring countries.
7.08    Over the project period, better industry standards and products grades
are expected to be evolved and enforced among local wood processors to ensure
that the standards are observed. BLC would be the agency responsible for
production. Sawmilling would be undertaken by the private sector. In the
medium and longer-term, the Department of Trade and Industries well as the
Export Division of the STCB would be involved, the former in the evolution of
export grades and standards and the supervision and maintenance of qaality at
all stages of industrial processing, and the latter in providing promotional
services abroad as well as monitoring the external market situation and
advising on export possibilities. With these measures, and a large market on
its borders, it is reasonable to assume that both the markets and market
prices for Bhutanese conifers would increase over time.
C. Prices and Revenues
7.09    Although other countries could supply large quantities of coniferous
timber to India in the future, prices are not likely to be greatly affected in
the short run or during the project period owing to three factors: (a) many
of the small Indian timber traders and users do not have ready access to hard
currency for purchases from third countries, so that Bhutanese supplies would
still be favored; (b) it will take time to establish full merchanting
facilities such as timber docks and warehouses in India; and (c) it will be
some years before the relatively small users can coordinate their purchases



- 48 -
enough to take in bulk shipments (usually 25,000 tons or so each). The price
predictions therefore assume a steady and madest 3S real increase per year for
both foreign and domestic users, the latter of whom the Government will
probably continue to subsidize.
7.10    The average sales prices for logo and sawnwood (from mixed conifers
including about 152 blue pine) are estimated on the basis of the following
1987 prices with real price increases of 3? per year up to 1992, and remaining
at that level thereafter:
(a)  Logs and Hakries to local mills:  Nu 630/m3s
(b) Logs for exports Nu 1,085/m3t
(c) Savnwood for domestic markets Nu 980/m3; and
(d)  Sawnwood for export:  Nu 2,100/m3.
7.11    In the project period, the domestic demand is expected to continue to
be satisfied as a national priority and the surplus exported. Given the
current low levels of savmilling technology practiced, there should only be a
marginal (if any) increase in local sawmilling activities until the skills and
standards can be substantially improved. Most of the surplus logs would
therefore be exported, although the export volumes will ultimately depend on
Bhutan's ability to improve the quality of its sawn products and marketing
strategy. Thus, the Marketing Division should place priority on selling the
large undisposed inventories. The scenario that is expected to develop is
presented in Table 7.1.

uncertainty over which agency was to handle exports. Export volumes
expected to decline by 1990 given the expected competition from foreign
sellers, unless counteracted by successful Bhutanese export efforts.
These expected outcomes are used in the analysis of BLC's cash flows and rate
of return calculations (see para 8.03).
VIII.  BENEFITS. JUSTIFICATION. AND RISKS
A. Proiect Benefits
8.01    The project has important potential benefits in that it woulds (a)
implement a bark beetle management program; (b) ensure sustained revenue
earnings without negatively affecting the resource base; (c) enable the
regeneration of forest resources; td) increase the institutional capacity of
BLC and PD to undertake systematic road construction, logging, marketing,
reforestation, pest control, and long term resource management planning; and
(e) provide the basis for planning and supporting future forest industry
expansion.
8.02    More specifically, the project would:
(a) bring the pest epidemic under control to prevent further
wanton damage to the valuable conifer resources of Bhutang



- so -
(b) earn valuable foreign exchange by salvaging attacked trees
before they deteriorate excessively and become uneconomical
to harvest;
(c) improve forest hygiene and regeneration to conserve forestry
resources by increasing growth rates and annual allowable
cut;
(d) develop long-term management plans to manage the commercial
exploitation of the forest resource;
(e) increase accessibility to the productive timber hinterland
through the road construction program, as well as improve
communications and social benefits for rural dwellers in remote
locations;
(f) enhance environmental conservation and forest fire prevention;
(g) install modern facilities to mechanize road-building and improve
log extraction and haulage, as well as appropriate maintenance
and repair facilities to maximize the benefits of mechanization,
relieve labor bottlenecks, and the country's dependence on
Imported labor;
(h) train local laborers and thereby upgrade local skills and
productivity and increase their employment and potential
earnings;
Mi) train staff and build up a pool of skilled technicians and
administrators to manage an increasingly sophisticated and
growing timber-based industry;
(j) develop a coherent marketing strategy for timber products that
would pave the way for increased commercialization of timber and
timber products; and
(k) improve the forest inventory and other data base in the
project area, to improve planning for other development
activities in the area.
A number of the benefits listed above, though readily apparent, are not easily
quantified; hence the estimated benefits in the economic analysis may be
considered to be conservative.



- 5l -
B. Financial and Economic Analysis
Financial Rate of Return
8.0<    The financial rate of return for BLC, based on from BLC's cash flows
'wit-* and 'without' the project taken over 10 years, is estimated at 552
(Annex 4, Table 3). On the income side, conservative estimates of sale prices
have been used (see the Supplementary Volume, Annex 4 on 'Production,
Marketing and Prices"). Production in 1987 will initially be lower than 1986
levels owing to the concentration of efforts on road building to ease the
backlog of the woods inventory. However, production levels would catch up
quickly as mechanised logging gets under way. The anticipated clearing of the
woods inventory would also boost BLC income over the project period.
8.04    On the cost side, the most significant additions are the cost of
mechanized road-building and logging operations, which at present are handled
manually. BLC staff costs should not increase significantly when the
operations becone mechanized; however, there would be some deployment (and
training) of its field staff, as they would have to learn how to supervise
mechanical operations.
Economic Rate of Return
8.05    The ERR is estimated at 42?, calculated over a 20-year period.  At an
opportunity cost of capital of 12?, net benefits in present value terms is
about Nu 135 million. The costs and benefits streams are shown in Annex 4,
Table 4. Investment costs are taken for all components over the project
period, with replacements. Also included are the investment costs of technical
assistance and equipment provided under a separate UNDP/FAO project
(BlU/016/85). Almost all the project inputs (vehicles, equipment, technical
assistance, etc.) would be acquired from external sources. Recurrent costs are
taken over the whole period. Royalties, taxes, and other transfer payments
are excluded.
8.06    Project benefits are based on incremental log and lumber (sawnwood)
production, valued conservatively on the basis of competitive auction prices
obtained by BLC and adjusted by costs of freight, processing, and handling
from BLC depots. Other less quantifiable project benefits have not been
included, for example, those from (a) the pest management program (and
anticipated reduction in numbers of pest-attacked trees); (b) the marketing
program (with anticipated product standardization and promotion, quality
improvements, and price increases); (c) institutional Strengthening (through
training, modernized techniques, increased accountability, and anticipated
Increase in productivitv,' ."id (d) additional employment and incomes generated
as a result of the pro4ect activities and externalities.
8.07    The calculation of economic costs and benefits is based on 1987
constant prices at an exchange rate of Nu 12.50 - US$1. The economic analysis
has been made in border Nu, using a standard conversion factor of 0.95 and
specific conversion factors as appropriate; details are given in project



- 52 -
files. Auction prices for products offered mainly by Indian buyers at the
depot are used in both the financial and economic analysis. Since Bhutan
suffers from a shortage of both skilled and unskilled labor, the shadow wage
rate is taken as being equal to financial wages.
Sensitivity Analysis
8.08    Sensitivity tests were carried out to assess the impact of variations
in the incremental cost and benefit streams on the project's viability. The
results are presented in Table 8.1.
Table 8.1: SENSITIVITY ANALYSIS
Case                                 ERR
Base Case                                42.0X
Lag benefits one year                    21.3?
Lag benefits two years                   13.3?
Decrease benefits 202                    19.1S
Increase costs 20?                       22.8?
These tests reflect some possible extreme deviations from base assumptions in
terms of the risks attendant on the difficult managerial and physical
environment in which the project would be implemented. They indicate that the
project will remain economically viable even if major setbacks do occur.
C. Environmental ImDact
8.09    A review of pest control alternatives that are applicable to the bark
beetle epidemic in the project area suggests that the method to be adopted
(which includes salvaging the timber and regenerating the area as quickly as
possible), is technically, economically, and environmentally the most
acceptable. Without these control measures, it is anticipated that the bark
beetle epidemic would spread rapidly, and potentially affect up to 100,000 ha
of coniferous forests in the vicinity. Without the means to extract infected
trees, a valuable source of revenue would be lost as well. Application of
these control measures would inevitably affect the environment, but action
would be taken under the project to keep undesirable effects to a minimum.
8.10    Apart from their very limited use in forest nurseries, no insecticide
will be used at any point in the project. The pest management program
envisages the use of trap logs and artificial pheromones in the biological
control of the bark beetle population and would emphasize forest hygiene in
clearing and extraction methods. Water sprinkling and log ponds would be used
to preserve log quality and freshness rather than spraying with chemicals;
although tested under European conditions, appropriate technical solutions in
general would have to be evolved in Bhutan and possible deleterious effects on

the environment avoided. These measures are more fully described in the
Supplementary Volume, Annez 1.
8.11    The major potential hazard in this mountainous terrain is flooding and
soil erosion, which could follow clearfelling of infected trees, despite the
fact that the relatively low rainfall, permeable soils and high tree root
density that would remain after felling in the project area would aid in soil
conservation. It is essential that these potential problems be avoided
because B1hutan's rivers, with their enormous hydropower potential, are
probably the country's most valuable natural asset. The following actions
would be taken under the project to minimize the principal sources of erosion.
First, in the road construction program, only a low density of roads would be
constructed. Efforts would be made to restrict gradients, avoid unnecessary
movement of soil downhill during construction, and ensure adequate cross-
drainage. Second, caution would be ezercised during tree felling and
extraction to avoid clearfelling of large areas and then only completely
infected stands would be removed; an effort would also be made to limit the
manual extraction of logs and to leave uninfected tree stands along water
courses. Third, gullies caused by earlier manual logging would be wplugged'
with small check dams and planted up at the earliest opportunity to provide
vegetative cover and erosion control. Fourth, two secondary but highly
important causes of soil erosion would have to be controlled, namely,
livestock grazing (by restricting migratory herds and others to alternative
pastures provided outside the regeneration areas) and forest fires (by
introducing fire prevention and control measures as soon as possible). These
environmental protection measures are summarized in the Operational Action
Plan (Annex 9).
D. Risks and Remedies
8.12    The main risks to the project and proposed remedial measures are as
follows:
(a) The extent of the pest attack may be more widespread than
observed and control measures in the attacked areas may not be
sufficient to combat the problem. Therefore, provision has been
made under the project for logging an area about 102 larger than
is observed to be affected at present. Pest surveillance would
also be undertaken to ensure early detection of susceptible
forests and efforts made to contain the spread of the pest
attack.
(b) Mapping, planning, road construction, and logging may be
delayed, and thus project benefits may be reduced. Efforts to
avoid delay include financing being arranged for technical
assistance in the pre-project year and funding by the First
Forestry Project for early procurement and some start-up
activities.



- 54 -
(c) The ban on livestock grazing in regenerated forest areas and
controlled grazing may not be successfully enforced, which may
result in higher costs of protection and/or poor regeneration
owing to browsing and trampling damage to young trees,
destruction of ground vegetation and a resultant erosion hazard.
Measures to minimize this risk include studies of the grazing
patterns and carrying capacity of areas adjacent to livestock
migratory routes. As a last resort, fencing and patrolling by
forest guards and/or local guards may be necessary. Contingency
funds forfencing have been provided under the project.
(d) The actual recovered volumes used in the estimates could vary in
places and could be less than currently estimated from cursory
visual inventory. The sensitivity tests for reduced revenues
indicate that even if this happens, the project will still be
economically viable.
8.13    The project does not include any radical changes in the existing
institutions nor does it envisage any sizable increase in staff strength.
Existing staff (especially in BLC) will be redeployed, and trained in
mechanized methods and new methods of organizing fieldwork. The project would
also draw on existing training facilities in the country and provide on-the-
job training by expatriate consultants.
8.14    Considering the diversity of project actions and the relative
inexperience of project staff with regard to new methods such as large-scale
pest surveillance and control, mechanized field operations, silvicultural
treatments that have to be constantly reevaluated given the dynamic changes
due to pest attack and control measures, new techniques of product packaging
and marketing and institutional accounting, some delays and adjustment
problems may occur during the project period. To minimize these risks, close
attention would be paid to project monitoring by the PC as well as by donors.
The Government is fully aware of these uncertainties and is giving highest
priority to the implementation of the project.
IX. AGREEMENTS AND RECOMMENDATION
9.01    The following conditions of negotiations were met:
(a) RGOB stated that almost all the required maps of the project
area have been obtained and the few remaining maps would be
supplied by June 30, 1988 (para 5.13);
(b) RGOB has amended the Charter of BLC to enable it to borrow
funds, and undertake reforestation (para 6.07); and
(c) RGOB has recruited two additional accountants at FD headquarters
(para 6.22).

9.02    At negotiations, agreement was reached with RGOB/BLC that-
(a)  RGOB would appoint the following consultants to implement the
project according to the schedules described in Annexes 8 and 9:
an entomologist (para 5.07); a logging management consultant, a
logging engineer, and three technical loggers (para 5.10); a
read construction supervisor (para 5.13); a workshop supervisor
(para 5.14); a silvipastural/rangeland management expert and a
field silviculturist (para 5.22); a sawmilling expert, a saw
doctor, a sawyer (para 5.23); and a financial management expert
