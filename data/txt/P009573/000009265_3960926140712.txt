ND(ORhNDZI AND RECOUIEJIMTION 0 THE PRESIDENT
OF THE INTERNATIONAL DEVILOPBENT ASSOCIATION
TO THE BXECUTIVE DIRECTORS
ON A PROPOSED CREDIT
TO TEE KINGDOM OF BMUTAN
FOR A SECOND FORESTRY DEVELOPMENT PROJECT
1.      The following memorandum and recommendation on a proposed development
credit to the Kingdom of Bhutan for SDR 0.80 million (US$1.06 million equiva-
lent) is submitted for approval. The proposed credit would be on standard IDA
terms with 40 years maturity and would help finance a second forestry develop-
ment project. The project would be cofinanced by the Government of the Swiss
Confederation for SDR 3.70 million (US$5.00 million equivalent).
2.      Background.  Forestry in Bhutan accounts for about 16Z of GDP and 162
of exports, and employs a considerable proportion of both local and foreign
labor. Almost all the timber products are sold to India; from an export value
of Nu 23.5 million (about US$2 million) in 1982, growth in this trade quad-
rupled by 1985. Exports of timber products to third countries are highly
variable, although the Royal Government of Bhutan (RGOB) is keen to revive
this trade as a source of foreign exchange earnings. Despite their concern
with export earnings, however, RGOB consistently emphasizes in its sector
strategy its strong commitment to environmental conservation and protection,
and the replacement of its forests. This conservative policy has resulted in
the estimated present extraction levels of about 7Z of the net allowable cut,
indicating considerable scope, within very safe limits, for increasing utili-
zation and expanding the revenues from forest products and thereby narrowing
the country's trade deficit. The major constraints to the efficient develop-
ment of the forestry sector are lack of data and detailed maps, rugged terrain
and poor forest access, lack of equipment and trained manpower, and lack of
experience in forest mAnagement. In addition, the forest is over-mature, in
decline, and vulnerable to disease and pests. A recent bark beetle epidemic
set off by unhygienic logging practices in the extensive coniferous forests of
Western Bhutan has already killed over 2,500 ha of spruce in the last two
years and threatens up to 100,000 ha in the vicinity.
3.      Rationale for IDA Involvement.  The serious pest outbreak in the con-
iferous forests described above led RGOB to request IDA's assistance for a
second forestry project, through which IDA would take the lead in coordinating
forestry development activities and utilizing inputs from various donors in an
integrated pest and forestry resource management program. However, beyond the
immediate need for pest management, a comprehensive forest resource management
and development program is needed for Bhutan to address all the other funda-
mental requirements highlighted above. A number of measures are neededs
first, topographic information is required for detailed management planning of
forest extraction and renewal. Second, a well-designed strategic road network
should be constructed according to the harvesting plans. Third, emphasis must
be placed on manpower training and on using appropriate equipment. Fourth, a
long-term program of silvicultural management and research must be instituted
that focuses on sustained utilization and conservation of the renewable re-



-2-
sources. RGOB has requested IDA assistance to design and implement a project
along these lines. The proposed Second Forestry Project would follow the
first (Afforestation) project, Credit 1460-BEU, which became effective in 1984
and is being successfully implemented in Southern Bhutan.
4.      Proiect Obiectives.  The objectives of the proposed Second Forestry
Development project are to strengthen the managerial and technical capacity of
BLC and FD tot
(a) control the epidemic pest outbreak in coniferous forest areas
by undertaking a program of road building, salvage logging, and
reforestation activities;
(b) coordinate management planning, pest management, harvesting,
and reforestation;
(c) produce and market wood; and
(d) institute effective financial control.
5.       Proiect Description.  The proposed project covers Paro, Haa and
Thimphu Districts in Western Bhutan and would be administered by BLC and FD
over a six year period.  It supports (a) FD activities in pest and forest
management, and (b) BLC activities, including road construction, logging,
workshop development, marketing, nursery development, reforestation, and im-
provement of the financial management system. Technical assistance and train-
ing support is envisaged for both BLC and FD. Funds for BLC's activities
would be on-lent from RGOB to BLC at an interest rate of 122 p.a. with repay-
ment within nine years, including two years grace period. The subsidiary loan
would be denominated in US dollars, with BLC bearing the foreign exchange
risk. The total project cost is estimated at US$31.3 million, with a foreign
exchange component of US$8.6 million (27?). Of this, investment costs amount
to US$11.5 million, and incremental operating costs US$19.8 million, almost
all of which is attributed to BLC's salvage logging operations to te financed
from its own revenue generation. Given its manpower constraiLt and limited
implementation capacity, the need to concentrate forestry development efforts
on the more urgent needs identified in the pest-affected areas, the need to
make an early start on essential procurement, and the wish to minimize the
volume of hard currency borrowing, RGOB requested that the scope of the First
Forestry Project be amended to permit start-up activities in the proposed
Second Forestry Project areas, thereby reducing the additional credit required
under the Secon't Project. IDA has accepted RGOB's proposal to reduce forest
clearance and afforestation activities in Southern Bhutan which are supported
by the First Forestry Development Project (Credit 1460-BHU), and allocate part
of the funds for purchase of equipment and technical assistance needed to
start up activities in the areas to be covered by the proposed Second Project.
The project scope and description for Credit 1460-BHU hEs been amended accord-
ingly. The proposed Second Project would be cofinanced by the Government of
the Swiss Confederation (which is already supporting forestry activities in
Bhutan). The Swiss-financed portion would be administered by IDA and would



-3-
follow Bank Group guidelines for procurement and employment of consultants.
The project would also be implemented in close coordination with the ongoing
UNDPIFAO technical assistance programs in the forestry sector. Retroactive
financing would be provided in the amount of US$100,000 to cover expenditures
incurred after June 30, 1987 (date of appraisal) for procurement of the
materials and equipment to be financed under the IDA-financed portion of the
project. A breakdown of costs and the financing plan are shown in Schedule A.
Amounts and methods cf procurement and of disbursements, and the disbursement
schedule are shown in Schedule B. A timetable of key processing events and
the status of Bank Group operations in Bhutan is given in Schedules C and D,
respectively. A map, IBRD no. 19860 is attached. The Staff Appraisal Report,
No. 6942-BHU, dated March 28, 1988, is distributed separately.
6.       Actions Agreed on.  At negotiations, agreement was reached pertaining
to (a) appointment of consultants; (b) financial covenants relating to BLC's
debt/equity ratio; (c) coordination between FD and BLC regarding cutting area
priorities; (d) maintenance of separate project accounts and submission of
audit reports; (e) submission of progress, including midterm review and pro-
ject completion reports by project authorities; (f) performance of a midterm
review of all forestry sector projects to improve coordination in the sector.
A condition of effectiveness is that a subsidiary loan agreement would have
been signed between RGOB and BLC on terms and conditions acceptable to IDA.
7.       Benefits.  The project has important potential benefits in that it
woulds (a) ensure sustained revenue earnings without negatively affecting the
resource base; (b) enable the regeneration of forest resources; (c) increase
the institutional capacity of BLC and FD to undertake systematic road con-
struction, logging, marketing, reforestation, pest control, and long-term
resource management planning; and (d) provide the basis for planning and sup-
porting future forest industry expansion. Economic benefits are expected from
enhanced revenues from the sale of graded and processed timber products; the
financial rate of return to BLC is about 55Z and the economic rate of return
to the project is estimated at 42Z.
8.       Risks.  The main risks and remedies provided for under the project
include: (a) a more widespread pest attack than currently observed--for this,
provision has been made for logging an area about 1OX more than is presently
observed to be affected in the project districts; (b) possible delay in map-
ping, planning, and implementation, although efforts to avoid such delays
include technical assistance and facilities being provided by funds provided
under Credit 1460-BHU, and in collaboration with other donors in Bhutan; (c)
possible difficulties in successful enforcement of grazing control in the
vicinity of regenerated forest areas, resulting in poor regeneration and high-
er costs of protection--to counteract this, FAO assistance has been obtained
to make studies of grazing requirements in the area and undertake pasture
trials, which would assist in the proper planning of grazing control and pro-
tectie' of regenerated areas; contingency funds for fencing are also provided
under the project, and will only be used if proved essential; and (d) lower
than expected actual recovered volumes and prices, although sensitivity tests
indicate that even with substantially reduced revenues or lagged benefits, the
project is still economically viable.



9.       Recouendation.  I am satisfied that the proposed Credit would eomply
with the Articles of Agreement of the Association and recomuend that the
Executive Directors approve the proposed Credit.-
