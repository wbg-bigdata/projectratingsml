Description         Jointly prepared by the Government and IDA in collaboration with
                    other donors, the Second Poverty Reduction Support Operation
                    (PRS02) supports the implementation of Lao PDR's National
                    Growth and Poverty Eradication Strategy (NGPES). The financial
                    support provided through PRS02 will help finance the costs of
                    implementing key elements of these strategies, together with other
                    domestic and external financing available to Government.

                    The second in a program of three PRSOs, PRS02 has focused on
                    three broad policy areas consistent with the goals and strategies
                    identified by Government in its NGPES and reflected in IDA'S
                    Country Assistance Strategy:

                        (i) publicresourcemanagement;

                        (ii) publicexpenditurepolicy;and

                        (iii) sustainablegrowth.

Benefits            The PRSO program aims to ensure that public resources arc
                    efficiently and effectively used to support Lao PDR's povertl
                    reduction and growth strategies; and to ensure that, over time, mort
                    such resources become available through sustained growth anc
                    revenue mobilization.

                    PRSO1prior actions included establishment of a Public Expenditure
                    Management Strengthening Program (PEMSP); restructuring of Lao
                    Aviation and two other major SOEs; enactment of revised Domestic
                    and Foreign Investment Laws; and other important actions detailed
                    inthe PRSOl ProgramDocument.

sngoing implementation of a five year Public Expenditure
Management Strengthening Program (PEMSP) and associated
Zapacity building; progress in costing the NGPES priorities and
reflectingthe allocations to these sectors transparently inpublic and
more timely budget documents; strengthened Treasury monitoring
of budget execution, including the implementation of a new
Government Financial Management Information System (GFIS)
across central government and to 14 of 17 provinces; and launching
of work to develop a revised government chart of accounts
consistent with international standards. In addition, PRSO2 has
supported the adoption of an action plan for the financial
sustainability of the state-owned power sector; the conducting of
independent external audits for major State-Owned Enterprises
(SOEs) and State Commercial Banks (SCBs); and the identification
and approval for restructuring of 4 further loss-making SOEs.

Further public resource management reforms supported by PRS03
will   include   continued progress      with    public expenditure
management capacity building; strengthened analysis and stronger
mechanisms to ensure budget allocations to NGPES priorities; the
drafting of an appropriately revised Budget Law and Treasury
Decree; the completion and approval of the revised government
chart of accounts; the piloting of quarterly consolidated budget
execution reports covering all ministries and provinces, following
completion of GFIS roll-out to all 17 provinces; strengthened
monitoring and implementation of bank restructuring; progress in
implementing approved restructuring plans in the SOE sector; and
implementation of further phases of the power sector action plan.

(ii)Better public expenditure policies:         PRS02 has laid the
foundations for realignment of public expenditure with pro-poor.
pro-growth priorities. Steps over the past year include an
improvement in the timeliness of salary payments to teachers and
health care workers; and an increase in the fuel levy to ensure thai
road maintenance i s more adequately financed. Jointly with donors
the Government has also conducted fieldwork for a Public
Expenditure Tracking Survey (PETS) and a Public Expenditure
Review (PER).

Further public expenditure policy reforms supported by PRSO3 wil
include further improvement in the timeliness of payment of salarie!
to teachers and health workers; further increases in the fuel levy tc
fund road maintenance; the issuing of a guideline on minimumpel
capita recurrent budget allocations in all provinces for the NGPE:
priorities of health and education; and the publication of PETS anc
PERreports.

(iii) sustainablegrowthandenhancedrevenuegeneration:
     More
PRS02 has supported the drafting and approval by the National
Assembly of a new Enterprise Law, intended to streamline business
registration. To promote export-led growth, Government has made

                      iv

xogress towards WTO accession and stayed on track with AFTA
:ommitments. The National Assembly has also approved a new
C'ustoms Law, intended to strengthen customs administration,
mhancingbothgrowth and Government revenue generation.

Further growth and revenue generation reforms supported by
PRS03 will include progress with implementation of the new
Enterprise Law and the revised Customs Law; further progress
iowards WTO accession and with AFTA commitments; and
?reparation of a forest industry restructuring plan to rationalize
industrialcapacity and resource supply.

Progress in these policy areas in turn will support a continuation of
the good, though still highly fragile, macroeconomic situation (with
growth of 7 percent in 2005); and continued progress with poverty
reduction (building on the decline in the headcount poverty ratic
from 46 to 33 percent between 1992/3 and 2002/3). As
programmatic budget support, the PRSO series i s contributing tc
increased predictability of funding, and the associated dialogue
between     Government    and    donors    to   strengthened   policq
prioritization and donor coordination.

Five main risks have been identified which could affect the impac,
of the proposed operation:

(a) Unevencommitment to reforms inthe past has resulted inpool
policy implementation performance.

(b) Weak public financial management systems indicate higl
fiduciary risk.

(c) Provincial autonomy hinders implementation of national
policies and an equitable distribution of resources.

(d) Continuing fiscal riskscould result inthe diversion of PRSO
funds away fromNGPES/NSEDP priorities, and to cover lossesof
State Commercial Banks and State-Owned Enterprises.

(e) Severe capacity constraints inthe civil service, due to the lack
of qualified personnel and low pay and incentives.

A discussion of these risks along with mitigating factors is presentei
inSection VIof this ProgramDocument.

            PROPOSEDSECOND POVERTY REDUCTION SUPPORT OPERATION
                        TO THE LAO PEOPLE'SDEMOCRATICREPUBLIC

                                          I. INTRODUCTION

1.       This Program Document proposes a Second Poverty Reduction Support Operation (PRS02)
for the Lao People's Democratic Republic (Lao PDR).

2.       Lao PDR's First Poverty Reduction Support Operation (PRSO1)' was approved by the Board
of the International Development Association (IDA) on March 31, 2005, together with the World
Bank Group's Country Assistance Strategy (CAS) and support to the Nam Theun 2 (NT2)
hydroelectric project2. The case for PRSOl was based on Lao PDR's maintenance of an adequate
macroeconomic framework, commitment to a coherent poverty reduction strategy and substantial
progress against this strategy, including completion of ten "prior actions" selected from the strategy
and agreed by IDA and Government. PRSOl prior actions included establishment of a Public
Expenditure Management Strengthening Program (PEMSP); preparation of a revised and more
fiscally appropriate 2004-05 budget; restructuring of Lao Aviation and two other major SOEs;
enactment of revised Domestic and Foreign Investment Laws; and other actions detailed in the
PRSO1ProgramDocument.

3.       The PRSOl Program Document also laid out a policy reform matrix and performance
assessment framework for a series of three annual Poverty Reduction Support Operations (PRSOs),
including "triggers" for the preparation of the second PRSQ in the series. As detailed below, the case
for the proposed PRS02 is based on Lao PDR's continued maintenance of an adequate
macroeconomic framework, evidence of continued commitment to the poverty reduction strategy, and
adequate implementation of the agreed reform program, with 10 out of the 11 agreed triggers for
PRS02 either achieved or on track.

4.       Lao PDR continues to enjoy rapid economic growth and impressive poverty reduction (see
Section 11).Inthe 1990s, real GDP growth averaged more than 6 percent a year and this impressive
performance has been sustained inthe first half of the 2000s. The economy has performed particularly
well in recent years, with growth increasing to 7.0 percent in 2005, up from 6.4 percent in 2004.
Macroeconomic conditions remain relatively stable, reflecting improved monetary and fiscal
discipline. As the IMF's recent Article IV consultations confirmed (see Annex 3), the economic
outlook remains favorable although substantial risks and major structuralchallenges remain.

5.       Progress with poverty reduction over the past decade has been remarkable by any standard.
The poverty headcount has fallen from almost half the population in 1997/98 to one third in 2002/03.
As such, the share of the population in poverty was reduced by 30 percent in a decade, lifting one
eighth of the total population out of poverty. Even though the population grew by one million people
over this period, the absolute number of poor declined from about 2.1 million to 1.9 million.




  PRSOl provided untied financing inthe credit amount of SDR 3.0 million (US$4.5 million equivalent) and the
grant amount of SDR 3.6 million (US$5.5 million equivalent).
  NT2 i s a $1.2 billion private sector investment project including the development, construction, and operation
of a 1,070 megawatt trans-basin diversion power plant on the Nam Theun river, a tributary o f the Mekong in the
central region of the country, about 250 kilometers east of Vientiane. Electricity generated will primarily be
exported to Thailand. The World Bank Group's support includes an IDA grant in the amount of SDR 13.1
million (US$ 20 million equivalent); an IDA partial risk guarantee in the amount of US$42 million; and MIGA
guarantees of up to US$91million.

6.      The National Growth and Poverty Eradication Strategy (NGPES) indicates the Government's
commitment to shared growth and social development (Section m). The NGPES was prepared
through a participatory process and submitted to the Boards of IDA and the IMF as its Poverty
Reduction Strategy Paper (PRSP) in 2004. The NGPES establishes a generally appropriate framework
for future reforms and makes Government development priorities more explicit and transparent. The
Government i s now in the process of "mainstreaming" the NGPES into its sixth five year plan (the
National Socio-Economic Development Strategy 2006-10).

7.      The World Bank Group's Country Assistance Strategy (CAS) for Lao PDR builds on the
NGPES; and the PRSO program forms an integral part (Section IV). Jointly prepared by the
Government and IDA, in collaboration with the IMF and other donors, PRS02 supports the
implementation of the NGPES. It builds upon a strong program of analytical and advisory (AAA)
work, both completed and ongoing, and complements the Bank Group's other activities in Lao PDR,
including the so far satisfactory implementation of the NT2 project.

8.       As detailed in Section V, policy dialogue and implementation progress under PRS02 has
been focused in three broad policy areas, consistent with the Government's NGPES and IDA'SCAS.
Progress inthe past 12 months suggests that Government's commitment to reformmay be deepening.

9.       Better public resource management: PRS02 has supported ongoing implementation of a five
year Public Expenditure Management Strengthening Program (PEMSP) and associated capacity
building; progress in costing the NGPES priorities and reflecting the allocations to these sectom
transparently in budget documents; strengthened Treasury monitoring of budget execution, including
the roll-out of a new Government Financial Management Information System (GFIS) across central
government and to 14 of 17 provinces; and launching of work to develop a revised government chart
of accounts consistent with international standards. In addition, PRS02 has supported the adoption
and initial implementation of an action plan for the financial sustainability of the state-owned power
sector; the conducting of independent external audits for major State-Owned Enterprises (SOEs) and
State Commercial Banks (SCBs); and the identification and approval for restructuring of 4 further
loss-makingSOEs.

 10.     Better public expenditure policies: PRS02 has laid the foundations for a realignment of
public expenditure with pro-poor, pro-growth priorities. Progress over the past year includes an
 improvement in the timeliness of salary payments to teachers and health care workers; and an increase
 inthe fuel levy to ensure that road maintenance is more adequately financed. Jointly with donors, the
 Government has also launched the fieldwork for a Public Expenditure Tracking Survey (PETS) and a
 Public ExpenditureReview (PER).

 11,     More sustainable growth and enhanced revenue generation:           PRS02 has supported the
 drafting and approval by the National Assembly of a new Enterprise Law, intended to streamline
business registration. To promote export-led growth, Government has made progress towards WTO
 accession and stayed on track with AFTA commitments. The National Assembly has also approved a
 new Customs Law, intended to strengthen customs administration, enhancing both growth and
 Government revenue generation.

 12.     In accordance with standard practice for PRSOs, progress in implementing this PRSO series
 i s monitored with reference to a PRSO Program Matrix, updated annually as part of PRSO
 negotiations (see Section VI). The updated Program Matrix for PRS02 (Annex 2) records the "prior
 actions" completed by Government for PRSOl and PRS02; and includes the "triggers" agreed
 between Government and IDA for the preparationof the third PRSO inthe series.




                                                   2

13.       At the end of PRS03, the impact of the PRSO program will be evaluated with reference to
expected outcomes and indicators, also set out in the Program Matrix, and covering all three
operations (PRSOs 1-3). The expected outcomes of the series of three operations were agreed
between Government and IDA at the time of PRSOl and have not been altered. Under PRS02, efforts
have been made to sharpen the indicators and baselines against which progress towards outcomes can
be measured.

14.       The evidence presented by the Government and the task team has been assessed by the East
Asia and Pacific Regional Operations Committee. It i s proposed that financial support to Lao PDR's
NGPES should be provided through a SecondPoverty Reduction Support Operation in the amount of
SDR 5.6 million (equivalent to US$8 million) on standard IDA grant terms. This will helpfinance the
costs of implementing key elements of the NGPES, together with other domestic and external
financing available to Government. The policy dialogue and technical support provided as part of the
PRSO program will narrow the gap between the Government's reform strategy and its ability to
design and deliver necessary policy reform measures in the face of governance challenges and
capacity constraints.

RECENTECONOMIC DEVELOPMENTSINLAO PDR
Economic context

15.       Lao PDR i s a one-party state led by the Lao People's Revolutionary Party (LPRP). With an
estimated per capita income of US$390 in2004, Lao PDR i s one of the poorest countries inEast Asia.
It i s classified by the UNas a Least Developed Country (LDC). From 1975 untilthe late 1980s, Lao
PDR was a centrally planned economy. In 1986, however, the Government introduced the "New
Economic Mechanism" (NEM), beginning a transition from a centrally planned to a more market-
oriented economy. Gradually, price controls were removed, socialist cooperative farming was
abandoned, the exchange rate system was unified, government's monopoly on trade was removed, the
number of state-enterprises was reduced and establishment of private firms was allowed.

16.       Building on these reforms, from the end of the 1980s onward Lao PDR has established an
impressive track record for sustained higheconomic growth (Figure 1).Inthe 1990s, real GDP grew
by an annual average rate of 6.3 percent4espite the challenges of transition and the sharp fall-off in
growth duringthe regional crisis of 1997-1999. Exports grew at around 15 percent a year.

17.      All sectors grew rapidly during this period-with                                  industry growing fastest but from a low
base (Figure 2). The share of agriculture in GDP fell from more than 60 percent in 1987 to below 50
percent since 2002.

                                          Figure 2: GDP Composition, 1987to 2004




18.      Recent macroeconomic developments are illustrated in Figure 3. Real GDP growth rose to 7
percent in 2005, from 6.4 percent in 2004. A large part of this higher growth was driven by expansion
in activities in the Sepon gold and copper mine, and the construction of the Nam Theun 2 (NT2)
hydropower project. The stimulus of these large projects more than offset the dampening effects of
highinternational oil prices and the expiry of the Multi-Fiber Agreement (MFA)quota system.

19.       Macroeconomic conditions have remained broadly stable since the recovery from the
aftermath of the Asian crisis. Inflationhas been brought back to single digits, with the period average

to floods. The cash budget deficit has been kept within the 4 percent target, despite slow revenue
growth and salary increases. The kip exchange rate has stayed in a very narrow band, and reserves
leveled three months of imports.The Bank of Lao PDR (BOL) has maintainedmonetary stability.

20.      The balance of payments has held up well in 2005, despite some adverse shocks. A surge in
mining exports has offset the impact of oil prices. But the imports associated with the NT2 project
have caused the external current account deficit to plunge to 15 percent of GDP, offset by capital
inflows, principally from ForeignDirect Investment (FDI).

21.      Notwithstanding good macroeconomic performance, the budget has remained under pressure
due to weak revenue collection combined with the ongoing lack of realisminrevenue projection, plus
the pressures to increase the wage bill (which grew by 24 percent in FY2004-05). Delays in
implementing key tax measures contributed to negative budget pressures. High public external debt
remains a concern (falling since 2002 but still very high at 83 percent of GDP in 2004 or 55 percent in
NPV terms). The crude cash rationing used to control the budget deficit has resulted in budgetary
distortion-with   non-wage recurrent expenditures increasingly squeezed-and                      build up of arrears to
Government suppliers.

22.      Credit growth at the State Commercial Banks (SCBs) has remained rapid, mainly because of
large credits to mining projects. The two main SCBs disbursed around US$14 million out of a total of
US$36 million of credit facilities to Lao Cement Industry Co. Ltd., a private cement-project. One of
the SCBs also contributed US$10 million to an international syndicated loan for the gold mine. Rapid
credit growth by SCBs, coupled with a large deposit withdrawal by the NT2 operator, caused a
tightening of the liquidity position of the two main SCBs. However, corrective measures are in place
and additional disbursements against the credits to Lao Cement IndustryCo. Ltd. have been frozen.

23.      Progress has been made with structural reform, although major challenges remain. As
discussed in more detail in Section V, positive steps have been taken to strengthen the investment
climate and to further liberalize the trade regime. However, reformof the largely state-owned banking
sector remains slow, with the recent Lao Cement Industry Co. Ltd. issue highlighting continuing
weaknesses in oversight. Progress with State-Owned Enterprise (SOE) restructuring remains gradual,
despite better recent progress in the utilities sector. On the fiscal side, Government has recently
started implementing a Public Expenditure Management Strengthening Program (PEMSP), and
progress has been made in rolling out a new Government Financial Information System (GFIS). On
the tax side, anew Customs Law has been approved, addressing a number of WTO-related issues, but
major challenges remain concerning central-local fiscal relations.

Recent progress with poverty reduction

Poverty headcount

24.      Recent progress with poverty reduction in Lao PDR has been remarkable by any standard.
The poverty headcount3has fallen from almost half the population to one third in a decade. As Figure
4 illustrates, 46 percent of people did not consume enough to meet basic needs in 1992/3, but this fell
to 39 percent in 199718 and to 33 percent by 2002/3. As such, the share of poverty was reducedby 30
percent in one decade, lifting one eighth of the total population out of poverty. Even though the
population grew by one million people between 1992/3 and 2002/3, the absolute number of poor
declined from about 2.1 millions to 1.9 millions.




  The povertyheadcountgives the share of the poor in the total population, or the share of population whose per capita
consumptionis belowthe povertyline.

governance challenges. As Table 1illustrates, Lao PDR lags behind regional averages on almost all
key social indicators; and lags behind low-income country averages on various indicators including
life expectancy, infant mortality and access to an improved water source. Lao PDR continues to have
the lowest ranking of any East Asian country in the UNDP Human Development Index (Human
Development Report 2005).

30.       Data sources differ on enrollment rates. According to data from the Lao Expenditure and
Consumption Survey (LECS), the gross and net enrollment rates for children in the official primary
school group (6 to 12) were 79.8 and 69.2 respectively in 200213. Remarkably, LECS data suggests,
the percentage of enrolled children collapsed between 1992/3 and 1997/8, increasingbetween 1997/8
and 2002/3 but resulting in almost identical enrollment levels in 2002/3 compared to 1992/3. Using
UNESCOdata, however, Lao PDR is not too far behind Cambodiaor Thailand: in2001, Cambodia's
gross primary enrollment rate was 86.2 percent, and Thailand's was 86.3 percent, compared with Lao
PDR's 82.8 percent. Either way, it seems clear that Lao PDR has a way to go to reach the goal of
universal primary education; and adult literacy at 69 percent i s well behindregional averages.

31.       Immunization i s one of the single most cost-effective health interventions. It i s especially
important in Lao PDR, where most children are dying from communicable diseases, such as malaria
and neo-natal tetanus. Village immunization programs have been expanded since the early 1990s and
now reach almost every village. As a result, access of poor households (with welfare ratios less than
 1) is almost equal to that of non-poor households (with welfare ratios more than 1). Similarly, the
coverage of villages with anti-malaria programs increased from 68 percent to 75 percent over the
decade. Such progress is likely to have contributed to the decline ininfant mortality from 134 in 1990
to 82 in 1999 per thousand live births, and in under-five mortality from 170 to 106 (UN2004).

32.       While child mortality indicators are improving, they remain among the highest in East Asia.
One of the likely causes i s the poor access for large parts of the population to safe water, as
contaminated water i s one principal factor behind diseases such as diarrhea. Access to piped water
barely changed between 199718 and 200213, requiring one in two households to rely on mostly
unprotected sources for drinking water. There are large discrepancies across priority and other
districts. Among priority districts, less than one in three families has access to piped water, compared
to six inten families innon-priority districts.

ECONOMIC OUTLOOK, DEBT SUSTAINABILITYAND DEVELOPMENT PROSPECTS
Macroeconomic policy andprospects

33.         Assuming that structural reforms are accelerated, real GDP growth is projected to stay at 6-7
percent, with underlying growth (excluding the large projects-the                Sephon mine and the NT2
hydroelectric dam) at around 5 percent. Sustaining underlying growth at 5 percent will require
ongoing efforts to complete trade reforms and to strengthen the investment climate. Accelerated
growth in agriculture and tourism is expected from increased regional integration, in addition to the
continued stimulus from NT2 and miningexpansion.

34.         However, a number of substantial risks exist. Aside from the possibility of an avian flu
pandemic, the major short-term risks to macroeconomic stability stem from the fragile condition of
the budget and the SCBs. The government needs to take measures to increase revenues, and to avoid
an unsustainable expansion of spending, particularly on payroll. Further progress in containing
banking sector credit expansion and promoting banking sector reform will also be necessary. As
discussed below, the external public debt outlook also involves highrisks.

35.         Latest IMFstaff estimates suggest that financing requirements to support this growth scenario
will be about 0.5 percent of GDP annually in domestic financing and from 3 to 5 percent of GDP
annually in foreign financing (Table 2). Lao PDR benefits from mostly project-related foreign
assistance. Apart from IDA'SPRSO, ADB and Japan also provide modest budget support and other
donors are contemplatingPRSO co-financing.

Debt sustainability

36.      Lao PDR's external public debt burden remains high. At end-2004 Lao PDR's stock of public
and publicly guaranteed external debt amounted to USD 2.1 billion in nominal terms and USD 1.36
billion in net present value (NPV) terms. This was equivalent to 83 percent of GDP, or 55 percent of
GDP in NPV terms (with indicative threshold of 30). The NPV of external debt comprised 199
percent of exports (with indicative threshold of 100) and 495 percent of fiscal revenues (with
indicative threshold of 200). All three debt stock indicators exceed the indicative sustainability
thresholds for countries with comparable CPIA ratings, placing Lao PDR in IDA'S"high risk of debt
distress" category.

37.      The latest joint Bank-Fund staff Debt Sustainability Analysis shows that even under the
optimistic baseline scenario, with revenues increasing to 13 percent of GDP, medium-term debt
service i s manageable only conditional on a prudent fiscal policy and continued reforms. The
expected boost to exports and fiscal revenues from large projects could help Lao PDR meet its
external debt service obligations in the medium-term. Nevertheless, the expected twofold increase in
debt service between 2004 and 2010 presents substantial risks to government's liquidity position
(Figure 5). Of the total projected increase in debt service between 2005 and 2010, 47 percent
represents increased repayments of concessional loans from multilateral creditors (mainly ADB),
about 23 percent are payments to Paris Club creditors and 30 percent i s due to the repayment of
commercial debt.

38.      Under the baseline scenario, the ratio of NPV of debt to exports would fall below the HIPC
threshold of 150 percent by 2008/09. However, this baseline medium-term outlook i s susceptible to
several risks. The priority areas that require close monitoring and strong policy effort include: (i)
maintaining fiscal discipline; (ii)  banking sector reform; (iii)           ensuring that new borrowing i s only on
concessional terms; and (iv) avoiding excessive reliance on natural resources. Under an alternative
scenario in which the revenue effort stays unchanged at 11percent of GDP, the outlook i s much less
positive, with the debt service to revenue ratio continuing to rise significantly.

39.      Negotiations regarding Russian debt restructuring are still ongoing, and getting better terms
than the preliminary 2003 agreement could alleviate some of the rise in debt service over the next few
years. Inaddition, Lao PDR now gets all IDA assistance on grant terms (and PRS02 i s an IDA grant).

Lao PDR i s now also eligible for up to 50 percent of grants within its performance based allocation
from the Asian Development Bank. Lao PDR has so far chosen not to avail itself of debt relief under
the Highly Indebted Poor Country (HIPC) initiative or the Multilateral Debt ReliefInitiative (MDRI).

Prospects for attaining Millennium Development Goals

40.        Lao PDR faces ongoing challenges in meeting the MillenniumDevelopment Goals by 2015.
In2004, the Government prepared its first MillenniumDevelopment Goals Report, jointly with the
United Nations. The MDG report sets the goals to be met by 2015, in accordance with the national
priorities and through the implementationof the NGPES (see Figure 6).

41.         According to the draft Lao Poverty Assessment 2006 (LAOPA), Lao PDR's progress towards
meeting education MDGs is slow. At about the halfway point between the 1990 benchmark and the
2015 target date, the three primary education indicators (net enrolment rate, completion rates, and the
ratio of girls to boys) are advancing slowly. By contrast, the literacy indicators (literacy rate of 15 to
24 year-olds and ratio of 15 to 24 year-old literate women to men) are roughly on target-although
ultimately, literacy of young adults will hinge on achieving universal primary education. The progress
gap i s widest for net enrolment rates.

Note: Lao Poverty Assessment (based on LECSIII data) and GOUUNfigures are generally consistent, but they diverge
widelyfor net primary enrolment rates. TheMDG report refers to administrative data, which suggests large improvements,
while the householdsurvey data shows sluggish increases only.

the health targets i s yet close to being met, progress inimproving health outcomes related to child and

and skilled birthattendance. Health indicators may be improving more as a result of general economic
advancement than government action. It should also be noted that the latest data are from 1999 and
2000. The 2005 Reproductive Health Survey and the 2005 Multiple Indicator Cluster Survey will
provide an update on the status of MDGhealth outcomes inLao PDR.

                            111.    THE GOVERNMENT'SPROGRAM

43.      The Government's stated intention i s to achieve rapid economic growth in order to improve
the living conditions of its poor, and graduate from its status as a least-developed country by 2020.
The Government's strategy to achieve these goals has been articulated consistently inseveral national
strategy documents. The most recently approved of these i s the National Growth and Poverty
Eradication Strategy (NGPES), which was approved by Government inearly 2004; and was submitted
for consideration of the IDA and IMF Boards as the Lao PDR Poverty Reduction Strategy Paper
(PRSP) in November 2004. The Government's Letter of Development Policy (Annex 1) confirms
Government's continuedcommitment to this strategy.

44.      The NGPES is the formal strategy document underpinning both the Country Assistance
Strategy (CAS) and the PRSO program. Developed through a participatory process, the NGPES
establishes a framework for future reforms and makes Government development priorities more
explicit and transparent. These priorities are consistent with the multi-dimensional nature of poverty
alleviation, and the action matrix set out in the NGPES i s generally consistent with these priorities.
The strategy, inparticular, seeks to:

         (a) maintainmacroeconomic stability by increasing revenue and ensuring appropriate
             monetary and fiscal policy;

         (b) deepenstructural reforms inareas includingpublic expenditure management, financial
             sector, State-Owned Enterprises (SOEs), private sector development, trade and legal
             development;

         (c) invest inthe social sectors to expand access and improve social sector outcomes;

         (d) invest in infrastructure such as roads, power and water supply, and expand access to these
             services;

         (e) invest inrural development and natural resource management-including      support for
             agricultural, mining,forestry and hydropower development; and

         (f) strengthennational capacity and institutions.

45.      InDecember 2005, the Government announcedits intentionto "mainstream" the NGPESinto
the sixth National Socio-Economic Development Plan for 2006-10 (NSEDP 2006-10). A draft of
NSEDP 2006-10 was shared with donors and discussed at the donors' Roundtable MeetinginJanuary
2006. The NSEDP 2006-10 integrates a good deal of the content of the NGPES and builds on its
participatory approach, poverty focus and results orientation. The Bank supports this mainstreaming
(Box l),   has commented extensively on the draft plan and will continue to work closely with
Government to ensure that the NSEDP 2006-10 i s refined and can be accepted as Lao PDR's next
PRSP.

46.      The NSEDP 2006-10 will be finalized in the coming months and approved by the National
Assembly in July 2006. Once approved by the National Assembly, the NSEDP 2006-10 will be
submitted for consideration of the IDA and IMF Boards as the Lao PRSP and can then become the


                                                     11

basis for PRS03 and any subsequent PRSO series in Lao PDR. Until that time, however, the PRSO
program continues to be basedon the NGPES.

                          Box 1: Mainstreaming PRSPs inEastAsia and the Pacific
         InEast Asia and the Pacific Region, IDA is increasingly encouraging countries to mainstream the basic
principles of the PRSP process (transparency and participation, poverty focus and results orientation) into
established national planning processes in order to increase effectiveness, avoid duplication and reduce
transaction costs. In future, national plans will be presented to the board as each country's poverty reduction
strategy and serve as the basis for PRSOs so long as they meet appropriate standards in the three key areas
mentioned above. Reporting requirements will also be streamlined. Domestic reporting will be strengthened and
used as progress reports to meet both internal and international reporting needs. Joint Staff Advisory Notes
(JSANs) will be written annually on these reports.
         A East Asian Forum on National Plans as Poverty Reduction Strategies will be held in Vientiane, Lao
PDR, on April 4 - 6, 2006. This is the third in a series of conferences on poverty reduction strategies and, like
the first two, is being organized jointly with the IMF, ADB, and UNDP. More than 140 representatives of
governments, development agencies and NGOs are expected to participate including senior officials of the Lao
Government.



                 IV.      BANKSUPPORT TO THE GOVERNMENT'S STRATEGY

LINKTO CAS
47.      The present CAS has been designed so as selectively to support the Government's National
Growth and Poverty Eradication Strategy (NGPES). Specifically, the first two objectives of the CAS
aim to support the implementation of NGPES priorities by: (i)          sustaining growth through improving
management of key drivers - regional integration and private sector development, rural development,
and natural resource management; and (ii)          improving social outcomes and reducing vulnerability
through strengthened public financial management and service delivery capacities and targeted
poverty reduction programs.

48.       In achieving these first two objectives, the CAS will also focus on its third and fourth
complementary objectives, namely: (iii)        adopting a strategic approach to capacity development and
partnerships to yield better NGPES results; and (iv) supporting the implementation of NT2 as an
example of an area-based, sustainable natural resource development program that contributes to
growth, social outcomes, capacity development and stronger partnerships.

49.       The CAS includes a mixture of programmatic policy-based lending (through PRSOs),
investment lending and analytical and advisory (AAA) services. The PRSO program i s an integral
component of the CAS, supporting the key policy and institutional reforms targeted in both the
NGPES and the CAS. The CAS was presented to the IDA Board at the same time as PRSO1, and
included a grant provision of US $8 million for each of the remaining two operations in the current
PRSO series (PRS02 and PRS03) plus a further US $8 million for a possible PRS04 (which would
be the first ina second series of PRSOs).

COLLABORATIONWITH THE IMFAND OTHER DONORS
Collaborationwith the IMF

50.       The International Monetary Fund's (IMF's) Poverty Reduction and Growth Facility (PRGF)
was approved by the Fund's Board in April 2001 and completed three reviews successfully before
expiring in April 2005. Subsequent reviews were not completed because safeguard actions for the



                                                        12

Bank of Lao PDR and key structural measures could not be accomplished within the timeframe of the
PRGFcycle.

51.     Since April 2005, Lao PDR has been under the Fund's surveillance-including    annual Article
lV consultation as well as half-yearly macroeconomic assessment letters. The IMF's last Article lV
consultation was concluded on November 18, 2005 and discussed by the IMF Board on March 8,
2006. The Public Information Notice i s attached as Annex 3 of this ProgramDocument.

52.     Overall, the IMF's staff appraisal highlighted: (i)the continued encouraging performance of
the economy in 2005; (ii)the favorable economic outlook, provided that progress i s made on
structural reforms; (iii)on the fiscal side, the immediate challenge of avoiding an unsustainable
expansion of spending, especially on the wage bill; (iv) the medium-term priority of mobilizing
revenues to enable Lao PDR to meet its development needs within a sustainable fiscal framework; (v)
the importance of further progress under the Public Expenditure Management Strengthening Program
to strengthen fiscal management and improve the allocation of public resources; (vi) the need for
prudent debt management to mitigate the risks from Lao PDR's highdebt burden; (vii) the appropriate
nature of the current framework of monetary and exchange rate policy, but with a need to strengthen
oversight of state commercial banks; (viii) the Government's intention to explore more actively the
possibility of joint venture partners for the banks; (ix) the steps taken to improve the investment
climate, but with more needing to be done; and (x) the need to strengthen economic statistics to
ensure better monitoring and policy formulation.

53.     These conclusions are consistent with those of the World Bank, as set out in Section IIof this
ProgramDocument. The PRSO programplays an important role in addressing the concerns discussed
duringArticle IV consultations, and the Bank and the Fundwill continue their close collaboration.

Collaboration with other donors

54.     PRSOs inLao PDR reflect an evolving partnership between Government and donors, with the
potential to become an important new aid modality and a powerful vehicle for donor harmonization
and policy coordination. During preparation of both PRSOl and PRS02, the PRSO program was
discussed with major development partners including the IMF, European Commission (EC), Japan
International Cooperation Agency (JICA), Japan Bank for International Cooperation (JBIC) and the
Asian Development Bank (ADB). InDecember 2005, the EC sponsored a two day Government-donor
workshop on budget support and several donors indicated possible interest in co-financing future
PRSOs-most explicitly, the European Commission.

55.     For donors not ready or able to finance the PRSOs themselves, the option exists to provide
grants for technical assistance in support of PRSO-related policy reforms and capacity building. The
PRSO is an ambitious agenda, and grant-based technical assistance plays an important role. Several
donors are already providing this. JBIC i s financing consulting to the Business Promotion Office
(BPO) in the Prime Minister's Office (PMO) to support the development of SOE restructuring plans.
The EC, ADB and Swedish International Development Agency (SIDA) are financing technical
assistance to support the PRSO-linked 200516 Public Expenditure Review (PER) and Public
Expenditure Management Strengthening Program (PEMSP). The PRSO process has involved close
collaboration with many other donor-supported initiates-notably,       the ADB's work on banking
reform, SLDA's work on tax reform and the United Nations Development Program's work on
governance and public administration.

56.     With EC and World Bank support, the Government is developinga proposal for a multi-donor
trust fundto provide grant-basedTA for the Public ExpenditureManagement StrengtheningProgram.



                                                  13

RELATIONSHIPTO OTHER BANK OPERATIONS
Complementaryoperations

57.      PRSOs are a complement rather than an alternative to sectoral investment operations: over
time, a satisfactory policy-based operation may give IDA evidence that country policies and
institutions are improving and allow more resources to be made available for both sectoral investment
operations and budget support. The PRSO program plays a key role in supporting other Bank
operations, both ongoing and as envisaged in the CAS; and in turn i s supported by other Bank
operations. Inparticular, there are strong links with the Bank's support to NT2 and the related Public
Expenditure Management Strengthening Program (PEMSP); and to the Financial Management
Capacity BuildingCredit (FMCBC).

Relationshipwith NT2 andPEMSP

58.      PRSOs are an important complement to the Bank's support for NT2. The World Bank
decision to support the NT2 project was based on a decision framework with three key elements: (i)
Lao PDR establishing and implementing viable development policies, characterized by concrete
performance, and national programs for poverty reduction and social and environmental protection;
(ii) technical, financial,economicandimplementationaspectsoftheproposedproject,aswellas
     the
the design and implementation of safeguards policies, being sound; and (iii) wider understanding and
broader support from the international donor community and global and local civil society for Lao
PDRsdevelopment framework and the proposedproject.

59.      The PRSOs support the implementation by Lao PDR of its development policies, and its
national programs for poverty reduction and social and environmentalprotection, as referenced in the
first element of the NT2 decision framework. The links to NT2 entail a high degree of scrutiny of the
reform program, including the PRSO program, through annual consultations with NT2 partners, the
International Advisory Group and ultimately through dissemination of information to the donor
community and the wider public.

60.      A key component of the first series of PRSOs supports the Government's program for
improvements in the transparency and effectiveness inpublic expenditure management, as laid out in
its Public Expenditure Management Strengthening Program (PEMSP). The PEMSP in turn supports
the implementation of specific revenue management arrangements to ensure that NT2 revenues are
allocated and applied transparently in support for poverty reduction and environmental protection
programs, to be selected according to an agreedeligibility criteria.

Relationshipwith FMCBC

61.      The FMCBC was designed to finance technical assistance and capacity building needs to
support the implementation of the Government's structural reform programs in public expenditure
management, SCB reform, SOE reform and enterprise development. Disbursements under FMCBC
have been slow: partly because Government has lacked capacity to identify program activities
necessary to achieve reform objectives and partly because Government i s reluctant to borrow for
capacity building and technical assistance. The program activities have been identified and approved
by the Ministry of Finance and FMCBC will be used to meet capacity building, equipment, and
technical assistance requirements under the PRSOs and PEMSP.

62.      FMCBC has already been used to support the financing of various PRSO-related activities,
including independent audits of SOEs and SCBs under PRSOs 1 and 2; and the recruitment of
technical assistanceunder the PEMSP, pending the mobilization of more grant financing. Government
will continue to draw upon FMCBC to support PRS03 implementation.

                                                   14

LESSONSLEARNED
63.     As the first PRSO Program Document noted, the track record of adjustment lending inLao
PDR to date has been uneven. The World Bank Operations Evaluation Department (OED) rated as
unsatisfactory the outcome of the first three World Bank Structural Adjustment Credits-SAC        I
(approved in 1989), SAC I1(approved in 1991) and SAC 111(approved in 1996). The first SACs
supported the New Economic Mechanism aimed at liberalizing trade and foreign investment,
strengthening the private sector, and improving macroeconomic management. According to OED's
evaluation, the SACs did not perform well-mainly       due to weak Government commitment to the
reform program and weak implementation capacity. OED recommended that future policy-based
operations in Lao PDR should take on board key lessons including: (i)       fostering greater inter-
ministerial coordination; (ii) taking full account of capacity limitations; and (iii)
                                                                                    supporting the
operation with adequate and appropriate technical assistance (TA).

64.     These lessons have been taken on board inthe design of the PRSO programas part of PRSO1;
and inits update as part of PRS02.

65.     Regarding Government commitment to the reform program, the Bank's increased confidence
in the Government's commitment to the reform program is based on the full implementation of the
FMAC, approved in June 2002, to which can now be added successful implementation of PRSO1,
approved in March 2005. Moreover, the PRSO program i s based on the Government's own poverty
reduction strategy rather than on an externally imposed framework.

66.     Regarding the need to foster greater inter-ministerial coordination, the Government has
ensured inter-ministerial coordination through the NGPES/NSEDP process and through the PRSO
Steering Committee and Technical Secretariat, with representation from across Government. As part
of the PRSO review process, Government has organized monthly inter-ministerial PRSO retreats, to
align implementation strategies and discuss cross-cutting issues.

67.     Regarding the need to take full account of capacity constraints, the PRSO program i s
designed as a programmatic series, recognizing the need to manage reform in a series of steps, but
focused on medium-term outcomes and monitorable impacts.

68.     Regarding the need to support the operations with adequate and appropriate TA, the
Government will continue to made use of FMCBC and other resources to support technical assistance,
capacity enhancement and institutional development efforts.

ANALYTICAL UNDERPINNINGS
69.     The proposed operation and program are underpinned by analytical work carried out inLao
PDR to date, including a Country Procurement Assessment Review (2002), a Poverty Study (2002), a
Country Financial Accountability Assessment (2002), a Public Expenditure Review (2002), a
Poverty-Environment Nexus Study (2002) and a Country Economic Memorandum (2004). These
studies have been prepared by Bank staff in collaboration with Government. Several of the studies
have been completed incollaboration with other donors including the IMF,ADB and EU.

70.     The PRS02 dialogue has also drawn upon ongoing analytical work, including the Lao Poverty
Assessment (LAOPA-a        16-month collaboration between the National Statistical Center, the ADB,
SIDA and the World Bank); the first Public Expenditure Tracking Survey (PETS-discussed in
Section V); the 2005/6 Public Expenditure Review (PER-discussed in Section V); the Diagnostic
Trade Integration Study (DTIS-leading      to an integrated strategy and action plan to enhance the
global integration of Lao PDR); and an Investment Climate Assessment (ICA-a     survey of 200 firms
being carried out incollaboration with the ADB).


                                                   15

71.      As part of the NT2 revenue management arrangements, the Government has undertaken to
conduct a PER and a PETS every two years, buildingon those currently under way.

    V.       THE PROPOSEDSECOND POVERTYREDUCTIONSUPPORT OPERATION

OPERATIONDESCRIPTION
72.      Jointly prepared by the Government and IDA and in collaboration with other donors, the
Second Poverty Reduction Support Operation (PRS02) supports the implementation of Lao PDR's
National Growth and Poverty Eradication Strategy (NGPES). The financial support provided through
PRS02 will narrow the gap between the costs of implementing key elements of these strategies and
the resources available from the Government's own revenues and other donor support.

73.      The PRSO programaims to ensure that public resources are efficiently and effectively used to
support Lao PDR's poverty reduction and growth strategies; and to ensure that, over time, more such
resources become available through sustained growth and revenue mobilization. The second in an
initial series of three PRSOs, PRS02 has focused on three broad policy areas consistent with the goals
and strategies identified by Government in its NGPES, and reflected in the CAS: (i)    public resource
management; (ii)    public expenditure management; and (iii)  sustainable growth.

74.      As summarized below, PRS02 and the policy dialogue, policy matrix and performance
assessment framework which underpins the program of PRSOs has supported the implementation of
appropriate policy actions in all three of these policy areas; and has helped identify further policy
actions for the third operation (PRS03). Progress in these policy areas in turn i s supporting a
continuation of the good, though still fragile, macroeconomic situation; and continued progress with
poverty reduction. As programmatic budget support, the PRSO program will contribute to
predictability of funding, and the associated dialogue between Government and donors to
strengthened policy prioritization and donor coordination.

SUMMARY OF PROGRESSAGAINST PRS02TRIGGERS
75.      Duringnegotiations for PRSO1, a series of "triggers" for a second PRSO were established
jointly by Government and the World Bank. These triggers, set out in Table 3, cover all three policy
areas of the reformprogram. The assessment of progress against triggers, also summarized inTable 3
and discussed in more detail below, demonstrates that the Government has made adequate progress to
justify a Second Poverty Reduction Support Operation. The Government has either achieved or i s on
track with 10 triggers, although it i s off track with one trigger. Progress made across diverse policy
areas demonstrates ongoing commitment to NGPES implementation. Table 3 also records the final
wording of the ten "prior actions" achieved under PRS02, as recorded in Schedule 1of the proposed
Financing Agreement.

Achieved. Following intensive inter-departmental discussions, as well as consultation with donors and other
stakeholders, the annual implementation plan and capacity building plan for the Public Expenditure
Management Strengthening Program (PEMSP) were approved by the PEMSP Steering Committee at its meeting
on January 9, 2006. The Steering Committee also reached consensus on including the revenue side of public
finances in the next update of PEMSP. It is the MOF's intention that the PEMSP will be updated by end-
September 2006, based on feedback from forthcoming nationwide consultations and the 2005/6 PER analysis. A
long-term PEMSP Technical Adviser has been recruited by MOF using funds from FMCBC and will support
implementation of the approved plan.

Prior action: MOF approved PEMSP annual implementation plan and capacity building plan for




Achieved. The National Assembly approved the high level budget plan during its October 2005 session.
Detailed budget breakdowns by administrative (organizational) classification were finalized by February 2005.
The Government has since conducted analysis to "map" the budget allocations by administrative classification
to allocations by sector and this work was completed in March 2006. As a first step in expanding the coverage
of the Budget process, MOF also collected summary financial data on major statutory funds. This data was
finalized and provided to the World Bank and other donors in March 2006, many months ahead of the normal
time for publication of the main budget documentation. This data has been consolidated into a "budget
summary" and was published inMarch 2006 with the approval of the Minister of Finance.

Prior action: MOF prepared FY2005-06 budget with: (i) administrative classification; (ii) priority
expendituresectors; (iii) summary data onstatutory funds




On track. A Chart of Accounts (COA) Revision Committee has been established inMOF and an international
consultant has been appointed and has started work. The consultant has already prepared an inception report
and a process and work plan for finalizing and approving the new COA and implementation strategy. However
international experience suggests that changes to COAs need dialogue and consultation with the users ol
government financial information. Complete fulfillment of this trigger (finalization and approval of the COP
and implementation strategy) will be rolled-over to PRSO3, with implementation as part o f the FY2007-OE
budget. This will allow time to ensure that the new COA not only is compatible with the IMF's Governmen
Finance Statistics (GFS) classifications, including the introduction of a "functional" classification, but alsc
includes "source of fund" fields to help the COA better support the NT2 revenue management arrangements.

Prior action: MOF initiated program to develop a new, GFS-compatible chart of accounts, budgei
nomenclatureandstrategyfor implementation

Achieved. The Government has made very rapid progress during PRS02 with the roll-out of its new
Government Financial Information System (GFIS). Data on accounts payable and treasury balances i s now
collected at central level and in 14 out of 17 provinces using this system. Once fully rolled out to all provinces,
the GFIS will be able to produce cash management and budget execution reports covering the center, the
provinces, and overall consolidation (on the recurrent side of the budget). These reports could routinely be
weekly, monthly and quarterly. However, the system is extremely new: the accuracy of data entry and coding i s
still being strengthened and reporting between provinces and the center remains a problem. Electronic transfer
of data between provinces and the center remains difficult and the Ministry of Finance i s taking steps to enforce
periodic paper-based reporting, using summary printouts from local systems, untilelectronic transfer of data can
be strengthened. Simple cash plans have been prepared at central administration level, but are not prepared at
province level at this stage.

Prior action: MOF maintainedand monitoredrecordsfor centraladministrationand selectedprovinces
of (i) accounts payableand (ii) treasury balances; andpreparedcashplansfor central administration




Off track. Since the signing of the 2003 Governance Agreements (GAS),quality of new risk activities funded
by SCBs has improved and rate of capital deterioration has slowed. SCBs have been able to set their interest
rate freely but there is evidence of non-commercial activities, granted in 2005, which were not certified by the
Independent Bank Advisers. Both BCEL and LDB granted and partially disbursed substantial credit facilities to
the Lao Cement Industry Co. Ltd in 2005. These facilities are inbreach of the BOL's prudential regulations on
single borrower exposure, raising concentration risk and running contrary to the GAS.The authorities have
taken action to freeze additional credits to this project and are seeking a foreign strategic partner for the project.

On track. Government instructions to cooperate with auditors were issued to parent ministries, and to the SOEs
themselves, in September 2005. A tender for an independent external auditor for the four SOEs has beer
conducted and a contract with the successful bidder was signed in December 2005. Work commenced in earl]
January and draft final audit reports were submitted to the Business Promotion Office (BPO) for review anc
comment on March 27, 2006. According to the agreed Audit Planning Memorandum submitted December 15
2005, a draft final audit report with the final report issued inApril 2006.

3n track. A Restructuring Unit in the Business Promotion Office (BPO) has been appointed to oversee the
ireparation of restructuring plans. On November 25, 2005, the BPO sent a letter to relevant line ministries to
:hoose SOEs for restructuring (letter 5438, 1754). On December 7, the BPO and MOF had a joint meeting to
igree the 4 SOEs to be restructured. The following 4 SOEs have been agreed upon: Lane Xang Phatthana
:LXP),Lat Visahakit Sanong Vatthou Technique (LVSVT), Lat Visahakit Konchak Kasikam (LVKK) and
aorisath Phalithaphanh Beton Lao (BPBL). The RestructuringUnit,incooperation with SAMD submitted the 4
SOEs selected, together with details of the planned actions, to the Minister of the Prime Minister's Office for
ipproval in December 2005. The Prime Minister's Office approved these four enterprises for restructuring on
December 22,2005 (Notice No 1941) and development of restructuringplans i s under way.

Prior action: Government approved for restructuring and initiated preparation of restructuring plans
Yor 4 of the 14 non-performing SOEs identified in the State Asset Management Department's 2003

Achieved. This trigger was fulfilled inNovember 22,2005 with the signing by all parties (MOF, MIHand
EDL) of the Power Sector Action Plan. The plan includes three components: i)tariff increases, with tariffs
going up by an average of 1percent per year inreal terms until 2011when cost recovery should be achieved
(based on the EDLtariff study -Electrowatt, 2004); ii)settlement of accumulated arrears from Government to
EDL, with agreement on a final arrears figure by January 31,2006, along with agreement on a settlement
schedule over approximately two years financed through rescheduling of EDL's debts to Government; and iii)
avoidance o f future arrears by Government to EDL.Government implemented a 5.5 percent nominal tariff
adjustment for 2005, as specified inthe Action Plan, with a further 1percent nominal increase inJanuary 2006.
InJanuary 2006 EDLandMOF also executed the settlement of government arrears accordingto the agreed
schedule of payment.

Prior action: Government adopted actionplan for financial sustainability of the power sector, to ensure
continuedfinancial viability of Electricit6 du Laos




On track. The Ministry of Finance has issued clear instructions inthe 2005-06 budget to prioritize the payment
of salaries, both to health care workers and to teachers. MOH has established a quarterly reporting system and
has generated a report on salary payments by province in the last quarter of FY05 and the first quarter of FY06.
This appears to confirm that Government has paid out the salaries of health workers such that the stock of
salaries outstanding more than 1month came below 22 percent of a month's payroll; and that severe arrears in
salaries (over three months) have essentially been eliminated at less than one percent of a month's payroll. It is
clear that further progress needs to be made, although Government has shown commitment and effort intackling
this problem. M O H has formally approved the questionnaire for the Public Expenditure Tracking Survey
(PETS) including questions on timeliness of salary payments to health workers and this will provide MOH with
further data to assess and improve timeliness of salary payments.

Achieved. This trigger was fulfilled by the October 2005 session of the National Assembly, which approved a
new Enterprise Law, replacing the 1994Business Law. The new EnterpriseLaw creates a legal platform for
strengthening the business environment, including a switch from "business licensing" to "business registration",
to a "negative list" of sectors that require line ministry registrationbefore starting a business, and a significant
reduction in the number of registrationrequirements and time neededto start up a business.

POLICYAREAS
77.     The following sections review in detail progress made inthe key policy areas covered by the
PRSO program. Each section discusses the key issues and government's reform strategy; progress
made under PRS02; actions that the Government plans to carry out under PRS03; and the targeted
outcomes of the series of three PRSOs.

Component 1: PublicResourceManagement

1.1: StrengtheningPublicExpenditureManagement

Key issues and Government reform strategy

78.     Achieving socially inclusive development in Lao PDR will require sustained efforts to
improve public expenditure management. Existing capacity and institutions for public expenditure
management remain extremely weak, frustrating efforts to achieve growth and poverty reduction.

79.     Established practices in expenditure planning and budgeting do not provide a sound and
predictable basis for aligning resources with NGPESNSEDP priorities, either at national or
provincial level. The budget preparation process i s based on unrealistic fiscal forecasts, and i s overly
compressed with insufficient time for dialog between MOF, sector ministries and provinces. Project
preparation and procurement planning i s often weak. Budgets are often published late, and the
structure and coverage of both the budget and end-year accounts i s deficient. For capital expenditures,
a parallel process i s run by the Committee of Planning and Investment (CPI) and the capital and
recurrent sides of the budget are not well coordinated.

80.     Although central Government has identified national strategies and national priority
programs, the bulk of public expenditures are managed at subnational level and established
intergovernmental fiscal arrangements and budget processes give MOF, CPI and sector ministries



                                                  21

little influence over how provincial administrations allocate their resources as well as providing few
incentives for these administrations to budget in line with local needs.

81.       Budget execution i s distorted by the ability of provincial treasuries and other sub-treasuries to
retain revenues which may not appear in the formal budget system and, in the case of surplus
provinces, to hold on to revenue intendedfor central government. This exacerbates cash constraints at
the central level and in poorer, deficit provinces. Budget execution has been further weakened by the
lack of consolidated and transparent financial reporting systems; of a comprehensive budget
nomenclature and Chart of Accounts consistent with international standards; and of a functionally
efficient and transparent national procurement system.

82.       Under PRSO1, the Ministry of Finance made positive first steps in establishing a Public
Expenditure Management Strengthening Program (PEMSP) covering the period FY2005-FY2009.
The PEMSP i s an ambitious agenda and some noteworthy initial progress has been made in
implementing it under PRS02, as described below. In addition, for the NGPES, the Government
prepared a rudimentary medium-term fiscal framework. A standardized nationwide Chart of Accounts
and Budget Nomenclature were introduced inFY 2004/05, although this does not include a functional
classification and i s not yet consistent with the internationally recognized Government Finance
Statistics (GFS) classification system. A sound legislative and regulatory framework for procurement
was put in place through the adoption of a new Procurement Decree (No. 03/PM dated January 9,
2004) and Implementing Rules and Regulations (No. 0063/MOF dated March 12, 2004) and the
Charter for the new Procurement Management Office (PrMO) was approved, giving the PrMO
 authority to oversee procurement across Government.

Progress made under PRSO2

 83.       Public Expenditure Management Strengthening Program. Progress has accelerated under
 PRS02. Following intensive inter-departmental discussions, as well as consultation with donors and
 other stakeholders, the annual implementation plan and the capacity building plan for the PEMSP
 were approved by the PEMSP Steering Committee at its meeting on January 9, 2006. The plans
 translate the high-level PEMSP implementation schedule for FY2005/06 into specific program
 activities with outputs/milestones set for each of them. In addition, to ensure clear accountability, a
 lead department and collaborating departments are assigned to each activity. The plan also identifies
 existing technical assistance and indicates additional needs to help coordinate and mobilize donor
 support to PEMSPimplementation.

 84.       The annual implementation plan represents an ambitious agenda for FY 2005/06. Numerous
 important tasks have been included in the plan, including reviewing of fiscal planning, budgeting and
 expenditure allocation processes; formulation of a simple operational model for a Medium Term
 Fiscal Framework; finalization of the draft revised Budget Law and its draft implementation
 regulation and guidelines; development of budget allocation norms; drafting of a new Treasury
 Decree and development of treasury manuals; completion of roll-out of the new Government
 Financial Information System (GFIS) and training of end-users in line ministries and provinces;
 creation of a Public Financial Management Capacity Building Committee; conducting of a baseline
 assessment on procurement; and design and pilot implementation of a procurement monitoring
 mechanism.

 85.       Under PRS02, the Government has made steady progress with PEMSP implementation. In
 addition to preparing the annual implementation and capacity building plan, the Government has
 appointed a long-term PEMSP Technical Adviser in the MOF; and has initiated discussions with a
 number of donors, including the EC, SIDA and the World Bank, regardingpossible co-financing for a
 PEMSP multi-donor trust fund to support PEMSP-related technical assistance and capacity building.

                                                      22

 Progress in the areas of expenditure planning and budgeting, budget execution and reporting and
 province-level public expenditure management are set out inmore detail below.

 86.        Table 5 assesses the targeted impact of the PEMSP program in relation to the HIPC public
 expenditure management indicators and benchmarks. As noted in the PRSOl Program Document
 from which this table is reproduced and updated, if the PEMSP programi s implemented as scheduled,
 Lao PDR would meet all but two of the benchmarks by FY2009. As noted in the PRSOl Program
 Document, it i s anticipated that Lao PDR will meet five HIPC benchmarks by the end of FY2007:


       0    reliability of the budget as a guide to budget outturn (indicator 3);

       0     classification of budget expenditures (indicator 5);

             identification of poverty relatedexpenditures (indicator 6);

             use of expenditure tracking surveys (indicator 10); and

       0     timeliness of internalreporting (indicator 12).
 87.         Even at this early stage in PEMSP implementation, improvements in these indicators are
 being achieved. By the end of the current FY2006, Government will have completed its first Public
 Expenditure Tracking Survey (PETS), the field work for which i s currently under way-and                        so
 indicator 10 will have met the "benchmark" level. In addition, Government has improved its rating in
 terms of identification of poverty related public expenditures (indicator 6) through the identification
 and costing of NGPES priority sectors, and the development of new early summaries of budget
 allocations to these sectors, although further work i s needed to bring this up to "benchmark" level.
 Progress against HIPC indicators will continue to be monitored under each PRSOinthe series.

 88.         Expenditure planning and budgeting. The costing of the NGPES i s a critical first step in the
 process to establish the interconnection between planning and budgeting. Under PRS02, with close
 involvement from MOF and CPI, the central ministries responsible for the four priority sectors

                                                                         23

selected by the Government in its NGPES (Agriculture, Transport, Health and Education) have
estimated their financial needs following a bottom-up approach. The results of this exercise have been
disseminated and discussed, and will be integrated into the medium-term fiscal framework being
prepared for the NSEDP2006-10, to be presented at the National Assembly inJuly 2006.

89.      Satisfactory initial steps have also been made to integrate the focus on NGPESNSEDP
priorities into the budget process. As usual, the National Assembly approved the high level budget
plan during its October 2005 session and finalized detailed budget breakdowns by administrative
(organizational) classification by February 2006. The MOF has since conducted analysis to "map" the
budget allocations by administrative classification to allocations by NGPESNSEDP priority sector.
This data was finalized and provided to the World Bank and other donors inMarch 2006, well ahead
of the normal time for publication of the main budget. With the approval of the Minister of Finance,
this budget summary was published in March 2006. As a first step in expanding the coverage of the
Budget process, M O F also collected summary financial data on major statutory funds.

90.      As part of the proposed revision of the Budget Law, the Government has held discussions on
options for revising the budget cycle. An early draft of the revised budget law, shared with donors,
proposes a timeline for a less compressed budget cycle, with central and provincial budget ceilings
established earlier allowing the MOF more time for analysis and dialogue with ministries and
provinces. However, the law and the revisedbudget cycle remainunder preparation.

91.      Budget execution andfinancial reporting. Under PRS02, MOF approved the establishment of
a new Government Financial Information System (GFIS) (Ministerial Decision 0607/MOF, March 10,
2005). More remarkably, the Government has also implementedthe new GFIS in all central ministries
and in 14of 17 provinces inless than 12months since then.

92.      Using GFIS, data on accounts payable and treasury balances are now maintained at central
level and in 14 out of 17 provinces using this system. The system i s extremely new: the accuracy of
data entry and coding i s still being verified and strengthened; and both communication links and
business processes need to be strengthened to ensure better reporting between provinces and the
center using GFIS. However, international experience shows that new treasuryhudget management
information systems take time to become fully operational and that "running-in" problems are a
necessary part of implementation. The Government's GFIS has been examined in detail by two
separategovernment financial information system experts and has been assessedfavorably by both.

93.      Simple cash plans have been prepared at central administration level, but are not prepared at
province level at this stage and further work needs to be done under PEMSP to make the plans more
realistic and effective. The new data on treasury balances available in GFIS will greatly help in this
regard-ensuring that the plans are based on sound and up-to-date baselines.

94.      Government has taken the opportunity of the Budget Circular (Ministerial Decision
2372/MOF, November 7, 2005) to clarify the division of responsibilities for budget execution
between Treasury and Budget Departments. Expenditure approvals are now to a much greater extent
left to the Treasury, with the Budget Department playing a more strategic monitoring role. Further
work on this issue i s ongoing under the PEMSP.

95.      A Chart of Accounts (COA) Revision Committee has been established in MOF and an
international consultant to assist the committee has been appointed and has started work. The
consultant has prepared an inception report, and a process and work plan for finalizing and approving
the new COA and implementation strategy. International experience suggests that changes to COAs
need dialogue and consultation with the users of government financial information. Complete



                                                  24

fulfillment of this trigger (finalization and approval of the COA and implementation strategy) will be
rolled-over to PRS03.

96.     As part of the proposed revision of the Budget Law and the Treasury Decree, the Government
has held discussions on options for restructuring and strengthening of the Treasury; and on
consolidation of budget execution functions. The draft NSEDP, shared with donors in January 2006,
includes a clear commitment to restructure the Treasury at every level, including strengthening of the
authority of the central Treasury. However, these issuesremain under discussion.

97.     Following the drafting of the National Procurement Manual, including Standard Bidding
Documents (SBDs) with the assistance of international consultants under PRSO1, PrMO translated
the documents into Lao, completed internal stakeholder consultation on the most important and
commonly used SBDs and has shared them with key external partners for feedback to facilitate
harmonization. PrMO also developed a procurement capacity building program which will be
implemented with financing from the FMCBC; and initiated a baseline assessment and the
development of a performance monitoring and evaluation systemfor procurement.

98.     Provinces.     To oversee the proposed revision of the Budget Law, the Government has
established a Budget Law Revision Committee and has initiated discussions on options for revising
and clarifying revenue and expenditure assignments and central-local fiscal transfers. The draft
NSEDP states that the new Budget Law will "renovate and refine" central-local fiscal relations and an
early draft of the revised Budget Law, shared with donors, addresses these issues. However, the early
draft law requires further work and these issues remain under discussion.

Progress expected under PRSO3

99.     It i s the MOF's intention that the PEMSP will be updated by end-September 2006, based on
feedback from forthcoming nationwide consultations and on 2005 PER analysis. It i s anticipated that
a multi-donor trust fund to support the PEMSP will be established and that there will be ongoing
progress with implementation and capacity building.

 100.   Expenditure planning and budgeting. As part of PRS03, MOF, MOH, MOE and provinces
have agreed to develop and issue a guideline on minimumper capita budget allocations for education
and health programs in every province. This will be a first step towards establishing a mechanism,
consistent with the principle of decentralization, by which government can ensure minimum service
standards and expenditure allocations to NGPESNSEDP priority programs in each province. While
continuing to have substantial discretion over the use of their budgets, provinces will be assisted to
ensure that an appropriate minimumi s allocated for basic education and basic health programs. These
minimum per capita allocations for health and education in each province will be issued by
Government under PRS02 and will be introduced as part of the FY2007-08 Budget.

 101.   Like under PRS02, Government will prepare a summary of the resulting budget allocations.
This will include not only a breakdown by the established administrative classifications but also
province-by-province allocations to NGPESNSEDP priority sectors and summary data on statutory
funds. This summary will bepublishedwithin the first quarter of the fiscal year.

 102.   Budget execution andfinancial reporting. DuringPRS03, MOF will complete the drafting of
an appropriately revised Budget Law, Treasury Decree and other implementing regulations and
guidelines. It is anticipated that this new legislative and regulatory framework will address key issues
including: (i)various aspects of central-local fiscal relations (possibly including expenditure and
revenue assignments and central-local transfers); (ii)   the restructuring strengthening of the Treasury
and consolidationof budget execution functions; and (iii)    the revision of the budget cycle.


                                                     25

103.    MOF will complete and approve a revised, GFS-compatible COA and budget nomenclature,
together with an implementation strategy and building on consultations with key stakeholders
(including CPI, sector ministries, provinces and donors). The roll-over of complete fulfillment of this
trigger from PRS02 will allow time to ensure that the new COA not only i s compatible with the
IMF's GFS (Government Finance Statistics) classifications, including the introduction of a
"functional" classification, but also includes "source of fund" fields to ensure that the COA can
support the NT2 revenue management arrangements.

104.    To ensure that GFIS can generate timely, accurate and'appropriate budget execution reports,
MOF will approve a reporting format for quarterly budget execution reports; will develop a tool for
extracting the necessary data from the GFIS; and will the proceed to pilot new quarterly consolidated
budget execution reports generated from GFIS. This will be an important step towards more timely
and informative reporting of in-year budget execution and will support the achievement of the NT2
revenue management arrangements.

105.    During PRS03, PrMO will take steps to ensure standardized application of procurement
rules, including systematic publication of procurement information and monitoring of outcomes. The
National Procurement Manual, including Standard Bidding Documents, will be formally adopted and
put into mandatory use, increasing standardization and transparency of public procurement processes.
An e-procurement website and bulletin will be established by PrMO, marking a significant step
forward for increased competition and transparency inpublic procurement. The system for monitoring
and evaluating performance of procurement outcomes will be established and put in use by PrMO,
enabling the Government to obtain information on procurement operations, monitor application and
compliance with rules, track progress in procurement reforms, assess impact on the outputs of the
procurement process, gauge the general health of the procurement environment in the country and
introduce corrective measuresfor further improvement.

106.     Provinces. As mentioned above, the draft revised Budget Law, Treasury Decree and other
implementation regulations and guidelines will seek to reform some aspects of central-local fiscal
relations (possibly including expenditure and revenue assignments and central-local transfers). This
will be supported by the development of a training program for provincial finance officials to ensure
full understanding and acceptanceof the new legislationandregulations.

End-of-series outcomes

 107.    End-of-series outcomes targeted by the PRSO program by the PRSO program under this sub-
component include:

         (a) strengthenedpublic expenditure management;

         (b) improved predictability and NGPESNSEDPalignment of expenditure allocations;

         (c) a streamlined budget preparation process and timely publication of the budget;

         (d) progress towards a more centralizedTreasury with consolidatedfunctions;

         (e) consolidated and more transparent financial reporting systems;

         (f) enhancedpredictability, efficiency and transparency of budget execution;

         (g) enhancedefficiency and transparency of the nationalprocurement system; and

         (h) increasedcoherence between provincial expenditure allocations and NGPESpriorities.

1.2: Strengtheningthe Banking Sector

Key issues and Government reform strategy

108.     Strengthening of the banking sector i s important to ensure adequate financing for private
sector-led growth in Lao PDR. More immediately, it i s necessary in order to ensure that fiscal and
monetary pressures from the State Commercial Banks (SCBs) do not distort public resource
management andjeopardize macroeconomic stability.

109.     The Lao banking sector remains rudimentary and predominantly state-owned. The sector
remains small, with assets of less than US$630 million and loans of US$250 million in 2004. The
three SCBs-Banque        Commercial ExtCrieur du Laos (BCEL), Lao Development Bank (LDB) and
Agricultural Promotion Bank (APB)-account       for about 55 percent of the loan market. Three private
domestic banks (two joint ventures and one with fully private ownership) account for about 31
percent; and six foreign bank branches for the remaining 14percent.

110.     All SCBs are insolvent with large outstanding Non-Performing Loans (NPLs). SCBs continue
to be susceptible to pressure to extend non-commercial lending; their capacity to evaluate credits,
while being gradually improved, remains weak; proper governance structures, with checks and
balances such as external board members, remain absent. Bank of Laos (BOL) capacity to conduct
supervision and enforce prudential regulations continues to be weak.

111.     Since 2000, and with ADB, World Bank and IMF assistance, Government has embarked on
an ambitious banking sector restructuringprogram with three broad objectives: restructuringthe two
SCBs; strengthening bank supervision; and improving the overall banking environment. The focuses
are on the operational restructuring of SCBs and increased transparency. SCBs will be rewarded with
gradual recapitalization only if they can achieve the performance targets. The Bank Restructuring
Implementation Committee (BRIC) was established to oversee program implementation and ensure
that reforms are undertaken according to the agreed timetable, with involvement of MOF and BOL.

112.     The implementation of the restructuringprogramhas been slower than originally envisaged. It
was not untilearly 2003 that key strengthening actions began. In2003, the framework was formalized
with each SCB committing itself to the programunder a separate "Governance Agreement" co-signed
by the SCB, MOF and the BOL. Inthe meantime, the SCBs continued to extend noncommercial loans
and make losses, with their asset quality deteriorating further in 2002. Figure 7 and Tables 6 and 7
illustrate the extent of progress.

113.      Since 2003, a certain amount of progress has been made in stabilizing the financial conditions
of BCEL and LDB. A new management team was appointed for each SCB and started working in
early 2003. New branch managers were also appointed, and audit committees and asset and liability
management committees were established. New operational policies (including credit policies), along
with strengthened procedures and internal organization, have been designed with the help of the
international advisers and adopted by the SCBs' boards. Each SCB has been assisted by an
International Banking Adviser (IBA), whose role i s to assist in strengthening the SCB' s operations,
especially in the credit review process. The introduction of certification by IBAs for lending decision             .
seems to have had positive impact on the quality of new credits from 2003 onward. Independent
International Financial Reporting Standard (IFRS) audits were completed for the period 2001-2003.

114.      However the risk of further deterioration remains high given rapid expansion of credits by
both SCBs in recent years. Pressure for non-commercial lending continues. NPL resolution i s slow.
The enforcement of newly approved operational policies and procedures, especially in the credit
underwriting process, needs to be enhanced. Moreover, proper governance structures with checks and
balances remain absent or hampered by the lack of a fully independent board of directors. The current
compositions of the Boards of Directors lack checks and balances, with no independent non-executive
directors. The MOF has not monitored progress of SCB restructuring closely and has not actively
exercised its ownership role in appointing qualified directors to the SCBs' boards as stipulated in the
Governance Agreements.

115.      The government i s in the process of revising Governance Agreements with the assistance of
the ADB. These revised agreements will seek to streamline the management structure of the banks to

                                                           28

make managers more accountable and are expected to put greater emphasis on concrete improvements
infinancial performance. The IBAswill be given expandedresponsibility for monitoring performance
against the operational and financial benchmarks.

Progressachieved under PRSO2

116.    After a long delay, the MOF approved in September 2005 the first tranche of recapitalization
for BCEL and LDB in the amount of 129 billion Kip and 71 billion Kip, respectively. This was based
on an agreement in August 2005 that MOF will conditionally recapitalize each SCB in four tranches
totaling 634 billion Kip from 2005 to 2008, mainly in form of bonds to compensate for losses from
directed credits to SOEs and credits guaranteed by MOF. The trigger for the first phased
recapitalization was achieved by the signing of the Governance Agreement by each SCB-relatively
easy to achieve. However subsequent tranches of recapitalization will be approved only if SCBs meet
specified performance targets. The decision to proceed with each tranche of recapitalization will be
made by the Bank RestructuringImplementation Committee (BRIC).

117.    The fiscal and monetary risks associated with the SCBs have continued during the PRS02
period. However, progress has been made in strengthening the transparency of the SCBs, with BOL
submitting to MOF draft 2004 independent IFRS audits for BCEL and LDB and procuring an auditor
to conduct 2004 and 2005 independent IFRS audits for APB. The draft 2004 audits for BCEL and
LDB were completed and submitted to each of these SCBs at the end of November 2005. Final audits
will be completed shortly. Because the procurement of an auditor to conduct 2004 audit of APB was
delayed, the authorities decided to combine the procurement of audit services for both 2004 and 2005
audits of APB. The procurement i s now underway and firms have been short-listed with work
expected to start inApril 2006.

 118.    Despite some progress, it i s nevertheless clear that compliance with Governance Agreements
and guidelines on autonomy, risk activities, NPLs and concentration has not been achieved and i s off
track. Since the signing of the 2003 Governance Agreements in early 2003, quality of SCBs' new
credits has improved and rate of capital deterioration has slowed. SCBs have been able to set their
interest rates freely. However, there i s evidence of material noncompliance with the Governance
Agreements with respect to SCBs' autonomy and credit underwriting criteria. Both SCBs granted and
partially disbursed substantial credit facilities to the Lao Cement Industry Co. Ltd in 2005 without
International Banking Adviser (IBA) certification. These facilities are also in breach of the BOL's
prudential regulations on single borrower exposure without prior approval, raising concentration risk
and running contrary to the Governance Agreements. The authorities are encouraging the project to
identify a strategic partner. Meanwhile, BOL has been instructedto freeze additional disbursements to
this project and this is being closely monitoredbythe ADB, IMFandWorldBank.

Progress expectedunder PRSO3

 119.    Under PRS03, there will be renewed emphasis on regular and transparent monitoring of the
SCBs; and on more proactive oversight by the Bank Restructuring Implementation Committee
(BRIC), MOF and BOL. It i s expected that the BRIC will submit to MOF a quarterly and quantitative
evaluation of BCEL and LDB performance against operational and financial targets. It i s expected
that MOF and BOL will take strong corrective actions for targets off track. BRIC i s expected to
monitor the quarterly performance of each SCB at least in the following areas: (i)credits by
classification (including off-balance sheet items); (ii)  new credits originated post April 1, 2003 by
classification; (iii)the amount of NPL resolution and its breakdown; (iii)the reduction in
concentration risk (exposure to any individual borrower); (iv) the percentage of credits subject to the
IBA's certification which were approved by SCBs without IBA certification and concurrence; and (v)



                                                    29

the percentage of growth in SCB credits. The World Bank will closely monitor these reports, and the
corrective actions taken, working incontinued partnership with ADB and the IMF.

120.    It i s anticipated that BOL will submit to MOF the independent IFRS 2005 audits for BCEL,
LDB and APB within 6 months of end-of-year and will also follow up recommendations of 2004
audits with each SCB. The procurement of IFRS 2005 audits for BCEL and LDB will be initiated in
the coming weeks, following the finalization of 2004 audits. The procurement of auditors for APB
will also move forward shortly.

121.    By PRS03, the MOF i s expected to appoint qualified representatives to the Boards of BCEL
and LDB. In the original Governance Agreements, the MOF was expected to provide effective
oversight of the SCBs as shareholder. However the MOF has not been actively engaged inoverseeing
the SCBs. Recently the MOF has set up an internal team to exercise its ownership role more
effectively, and will appoint representatives to the board of directors of each SCB.

End-of-series outcomes

122.    The end-of-series outcome targeted by the PRSO programunder this sub-component is:

         (a) enhanced commercialization, transparency and sustainability of SCBs.

1.3: Improving the Performance of State-OwnedEnterprises

Key issues and Government reform strategy

 123.    Reforms implemented in the early 1990s reduced Lao PDR's State-Owned Enterprise (SOE)
sector substantially. The SOEs today are fewer in number and play a significantly reduced role inthe
Lao economy in terms of share of GDP and employment. Nevertheless, remaining SOEs continue to
generate losses; continue to receive loans guaranteedby the state budget; and continue to account for
a significant share of the stock of non-performing loans (NPLs) in the banking sector. Efforts to
strengthen State-Owned Enterprises (SOEs) are necessary to ensure that the remaining loss-making
SOEs do not create further fiscal burdens on the budget or further solvency problems for the banking
sector. For the longer term, such efforts will help ensure that the remaining state-owned enterprises
become more transparent and commercially viable.

 124.    Currently, SOEs continue to benefit from loans guaranteed by the Government budget. For
example, Lao Airlines is likely to obtain a credit from the Import-Export Bank of China, which will
probably be on commercial terms but subsidized by the Government of China to bring it down to
concessional terms. This credit, in the amount of about US $25 million will be used to buy two
 Chinese aircraft, and will be guaranteed by the Government of Lao PDR. Without a joint venture and
consequently better management practices, it i s unlikely that Lao Airlines will be able to repay this
 credit unassisted. Action i s required to harden the budget constraint faced by remaining SOEs, and
 thereby to sharpen their incentives for reform. While the growth in non-performing loans (NPLs) has
been contained during the last year, several large SOEs continue to contribute to the losses and the
 accumulation of debt. They are still responsible for a significant share of the NPLs inthe SCBs.

 125.    In 2001, Government revived the SOE reformprogram, with a view to improving enterprise
 transparency and governance, restructuringthose enterprises which have caused losses to the state and
banks and rationalizing the regulatory and pricing environment for infrastructure SOEs through tariff
reform. The restructuring program that was initially supported under the FMAC addressed mainly the
 financial weaknesses of the most indebted SOEs. The focus was on operational restructuring of nine



                                                     30

large enterprises in two phases, including sale of non-core assets, and the gradual move to cost-
recovery tariffs.

126.     Gradual progress was made in late 2003 and early 2004 in monitoring the performance of
remaining SOEs and preparing SOEs restructuringplans to return Phase 1loss-makers to commercial
viability. Under PRSO1, Government carried out some restructuring of two Phase 1enterprises-Lao
Airlines (LA) and Bolisat Pattana Khet Poudoi (BPKP)-in accordance with the restructuring plans
set out in Notice No. 059/CPMO dated April 29, 2004. As discussed below, restructuring plans for
Phase 2 loss-makers, and for an additional Phase 3, are being drawn up under the PRSO program.

127.     The priority for action now i s to move the SOE reform program into more active
implementation. Implementation of Phase 1restructuring has lagged behind plans. Many SOEs do not
yet have functioning Boards in place or competent directors; and few SOEs have regular annual
audits. The capacity and authority of the Business Promotion Office (BPO) inthe PMO also remains
insufficient, although encouraging recent steps have been taken to address this concern including
establishing a new RestructuringUnit within BPO.

 128.    Government recognizes that this combination of factors limits the state's ability to manage
riskand execute SOE reformpolicy. Ithas recently taken steps to bolster the capacity and authority of
BPO and to accelerate implementation of plans. The draft NSEDP for 2006-10 indicates that the
Government will, over the next five years, "complete the restructuring and reform of SOEs from the
center to the provinces and the districts" and that "only a small number of key SOEs that are
important for the national economy will be kept".

Progress made under PRSO2

 129.    Under PRS02, Government has made further gradual progress with improving the
performance of SOEs. As part of the SOEs Restructuring Plan mandated by Announcements No.
 2 6 P M dated May 31, 2004 and No. 059/CPMO dated January 15, 2004, Government has procured
 and initiated independent external audits of financial accounts for FY04 for the four Phase 1 SOEs:
Lao Airlines (LA), Nam Papa Lao (NPNL), Pharmaceutical Factory 3 (PH3), and Bolisat Pattana
 Khet Poudoi (BPKP). The auditor (Ernst & Young Vietnam) submitted the Audit Planning
 Memorandum on December 15 and started work on January 9, 2006. Work commenced in early
 January and draft final audit reports were submitted to the Business Promotion Office (BPO) for
 review and comment on March 27, 2006. According to the agreed Audit Planning Memorandum
 submitted December 15, 2005, a draft final audit report with the final report issued in April 2006.
 When completed, these audits should enhance the management transparency and commercial viability
 of the four SOEs.

 130.     Also under PRS02, Government has identified and approved for restructuring a thirdphase of
 loss-making SOEs. On November 25, 2005, the BPO sent a letter to relevant line ministries to choose
 further SOEs for restructuring (letter 5438, 1754). On December 7, the BPO and MOF had a joint
 meeting to agree the four SOEs to be restructured. The following four SOEs were selected: Lane
 Xang Phatthana (LXP), Lat Visahakit Sanong Vatthou Technique (LVSVT), Lat Visahakit Konchak
 Kasikam (LVKK) and Borisath Phalithaphanh Beton Lao (BPBL). The Restructuring Unit, in
 cooperation with SAMD submitted the names of four SOEs selected, together with details of the
 planned actions, to the Minister of the Prime Minister's Office for approval in December 2005. The
 Prime Minister's Office approved these four enterprises for restructuring on December 22, 2005
 (Notice No 1941) and development of restructuring plans has been initiated and i s under way.

 131.     Finally, the State Asset Management Department (SAMD) of the MOF completed its
 performance monitoring and assessment report for SOEs for FY04. This survey consolidated and


                                                  31

summarized annual financial data for each of the remaining 49 central and 97 provincial SOEs and
identified loss making and non-performing SOEs among these. The SOE monitoring and assessment
report was submitted to the Ministerof Finance inJanuary 2006.

Progress expected under PRSO3

132.     Under PRS03, Government will complete independent external audits of financial accounts
for FY05 for Phase 2 SOEs: DAFI Group, Agriculture Industry Development Import-Export State
Owned Enterprise (DAI), Lao State Fuel Company (LSFC), SocietC Lao Import-Export (SLIE) and
Road Bridge Construction Company No. 13 (CC13). The Government will also follow up the
recommendations of audits completed for Phase 1SOEs: Lao Airlines (LA), NamPapaLao (NPNL),
Pharmaceutical Factory 3 (PH3) and Bolisat Pattana Khet Poudoi (BPKP).

133.     Under PRS03, the Government will also approve restructuringplans for Phase 2 and Phase 3
SOEs. With support from the Japan Bank for International Cooperation (JBIC), the Prime Minister's
Office (PMO) has already started work on developing restructuring plans for the five Phase 2 SOEs
(DAFIGroup, DAI, LSFC, SLIE and CC13) as per Notice No. 059/CPMO April 29,2004. The JBIC-
financed consultants completed their fieldwork on January 13, 2006 and have produced a final report
concerning each of the five SOEs. The report contains recommendations for the drafting of the
restructuring plans for these enterprises under PRS03. The Government will complete and approve
these restructuring plans by September, 2006. Government will also complete and approve
restructuring plans for the four Phase 3 SOEs identified (these are smaller enterprises and so rapid
progress is expected).

 134.    Most importantly, Government has agreed it will then ensure that SOEs make demonstrable
and measurable progress in implementing the approved restructuring plans. BPO will carry out
quarterly monitoring and evaluation and will submit to the Prime Minister's Office a semi-annual
evaluation of progress against approved restructuring plans for SOEs; and when needed the PMO will
take corrective action for SOEs off track. For this trigger to be considered fulfilled, it will be
necessary for the Government to be able to provide evidence to demonstrate that actions have been
taken to harden the budget constraints of these SOEs; and that it i s substantially on track with the
major restructuringplans.

 135.    Finally, Government will complete and approve the SAMD performance monitoring and
assessment report for all SOEs for FY05. This survey will once again consolidate and summarize
 annual financial data of all central and provincial SOEs and identify loss making and non-performing
 SOEs. It will provide Government with updated information on SOE-related fiscal risks and further
institutionalize the established monitoring and reporting systems.

End-of-series outcomes

 136.    The end-of-series outcome targeted by the PRSO programunder this sub-component is:

         (a) reduced SOE losses, greater transparency and commercial viability of SOEs.

 1.4: FinancialSustainability of Utilities

Key issues and Governmentreform strategy

 137.    Electricity and water utilities in Lao PDR remain largely under state ownership. There are
many challenges to the financial sustainability of these utilities. Tariffs have lagged inflation and
remained significantly below cost-recovery levels. Low and complex tariff structures have resulted in
 inefficient energy and water usage, and have reduced the resources available for further investment in

                                                    32

these sectors. Major arrears have built up to the utilities, including arrears from the government
budget. Against this, the utilities themselves have fallen behind on servicing of their debts to
Government.

138.    The Government's strategy is steadily to adjust utility tariffs to cost-recovery levels and
minimize cross-subsidy among consumer categories; to reduce budgetary subsidies to the utilities; and
to generate increasing private investment. Progress has been made with implementation of this
strategy in recent years, including not only formulation of more appropriate tariff policies and
schedules, but actual revisions of tariff levels and structures. Utilities have been given increased
commercial autonomy and regulatory capacity i s being steadily developed.

139.     Within the framework of PRSO1, all 17 provincial and the Capital City government
authorities were advised by WASA on urban water supply tariffs for the period 2005-2007, moved up
towards full cost recovery in line with the National Water Supply Tariff Policy (Decree N o 57PM
dated May 7, 2004). WASA's tariff reviews for 2005-2007 were accepted and implemented by eight
of the Nam Papa State Enterprises (NPSEs - in Bolikhamxay, Savannakhet, Champasak, Sekong,
Vientiane Capital City, Vientiane Province and Xieng Khouang). Two provinces (Luang Namtha and
Luang Phrabang) are currently reviewing the tariff proposals. The remaining eight NPSEs require
service and water supply system improvements before tariff reviews can take place. Tariff
Determination Guidelines for the 2005-2007 tariff reviews (Edition 6, November 2004) were
completed based on a unit cost approach to be followed by all formal urban water supply operators.

 140.    Inaddition, ElectricitCduLaos (EDL)presented aTariff Action Planto the PrimeMinister's
Office and started dialogue with the Ministry of Industry and Handicrafts (MIH) and MOF on an
Action Plan for the Financial Sustainability of the Power Sector (discussed further below).

Progress made under PRSO2

 141.    On November 22, 2005, MIH, MOF and EDL signed the Action Plan for Financial
Sustainability of Power Sector (Financial Action Plan). This plan i s intended to address the major
issues impeding EDL's financial sustainability, namely the need to increase tariffs to cost-recovery
levels; and the need to eliminate the stock and avoid future additions to Government's payment
arrears to EDL.The plan includes three main components:


     0   tariff adjustment, with tariffs beingrestructured and increased by an average of 1percent per
         year in real terms until 2011 when cross-subsidy among customer categories should be
         minimized and full cost recovery achieved (based on the EDL tariff study - Electrowatt,
         2004);

     0   settlement of accumulated arrears from Government to EDL, with agreement on a final
         arrears figure (as of October 31, 2005) by January 31, 2006, along with agreement on a
         settlement schedule over approximately two years. This may be financed, if needed, through
         EDL'sdebt service payments to Government which shouldgo upeffective January 2006 upon
         the expiry of a one time concession extended through a previous financial restructuring plan
         of EDL;and avoidance of future arrears by Government to EDL; and

     0   operational efficiency improvement by EDL, with overall system losses reduced from about
         20 percent in2004 to around 13 percent in 2011.
 142.    Government has made progress during PRS02 with implementation of the Financial Action
Plan. In September 2005 MOF approved a gradual settlement of arrears due from the central
 Government departments and agencies to EDL in the amount of almost US$4 million, out of which


                                                    33

almost US$1 million was disbursed in 2005. Subsequently, on January 1, 2006, the first monthly
tranche of the planned write-off of EDL's payments due to Government against the approved arrears
was executed (in an amount of US$ 69,000) in accordance with the Action Plan. On June 24, 2005,
MIHissued Notice 302 (effective on July 1, 2005) for a tariff adjustment averaging 5.5 percent, in
line with the decision made by the Prime Minister, and EDLimplemented the initial tariff adjustment
on August 1, 2005. On January 1, 2006 EDL implemented a further increase averaging 1percent, in
line with the agreed Action Plan. The adjustment for local inflation and exchange rate fluctuation,
which i s also a part of the agreed Action Plan, has been approved by MIH and i s expected to be
implemented shortly.

143.     The Decree on Regulation of Urban Water Supply Operations was promulgated on July 1,
2005 (Decree No. 191PM). This gives WASA stronger legal authority to undertake its regulatory
activities and covers all urban water supply operators. Regulatory Accounting Guidelines have been
prepared by WASA, which set out the principles of regulatory accounting, and should be approved in
2006.

Progress expected under PRSO3

144.     Under PRS03, Government and EDL will implement succeeding phases of the Financial
Action Plan. The Government will verify, agree and settle the past and new Government arrears on a
regular basis up to September 30,2006, after which the Government will take every measureto ensure
that EDL's receivables from all Government departments and agencies will not exceed 90 days. EDL
will invest to reduce system losses and i s expected to implement the tariff adjustment as per the
Financial Action Plan.

 145.    Inaddition, Government will implement succeeding phases of the water tariff revisions, with
provincial government authorities adjusting urban water supply tariffs further towards full cost
recovery in line with the National Water Supply Tariff Policy. Sector responsibilities have been
clearly defined. The Water Supply Division of the Department of Housing and Urban Planning
(DHLTP) i s responsible for the urban water sector policy, planning and development; WASA i s

 Component 2: PublicExpenditurePolicies

2.1: AligningSpendingwithPro-PoorNGPESNSEDPPriorities

Key issues and Government strategy

 147.    Aligning Lao PDR's public expenditure policies with pro-poor NGPESNSEDP priorities i s
central to delivery of these national strategies. However, it i s important to understand the interactions
between public expenditure management processes and public expendihre policies. The pro-poor
priorities identified in the NGPESNSEDP-basic        health, basic education, rural infrastructure, etc-
are services principally assigned to local levels of government. As noted in the discussion of
Component 1 above, although Government has identified national strategies and national priority
programs, under current arrangements the bulk of public expenditures are currently managed at sub-
national level and established budget processes give MOF, CPI and sector ministries little if any

152.    The Government has permitted the introduction of cost recovery for drugs, medical
consumables, diagnostic tests and treatment in public facilities. These charges increasingly constitute
a financial barrier to access by the poor. The Government has acknowledged the need to introduce fee
exemptions for the poor, and a number of schemes are now being piloted. These need to Red into
development of more comprehensive Government policy.

153.     Capital expenditure accounted for 79 percent of total health public expenditures in2004. This
i s an unusually large share. Some of this can be explained by accounting practices-donor
expenditures tend to be accounted as capital expenditures. However, it also reflects the strong
emphasis on expandingthe network of hospitals and health centers. Lao PDR already has significantly
more hospital capacity and health centers per population than neighboring Cambodia and i s even
surpassing Malaysia and Thailand (see Table 8). Utilization of these facilities remains low, reflecting
mostly lack of supplies and poor staff incentives.

 154.    Basic health spending in Lao PDR is predominantly the responsibility of provinces and the
Government's ability to increase health spending in line with the national strategies i s largely
dependent on the development, under PEMSP, of a framework for budget planning and execution
which ensures a mechanism for the delivery of national development priorities at the local level.

 155.    Improvement in health outcomes is a central priority of the NGPES and NSEDP. Key
priorities identified in these strategies include: (i)    strengthening the ability of health care providers;
(ii) improving community-based health promotion and disease prevention; (iii)              improving hospitals;
(iv) ensuring quality, safety, and rational use of drugs; (v) guaranteeing effective health
administration; and (vi) providing sufficient health financing. Program specific strategies have also
been developed for malaria, tuberculosis, reproductive health and HIV/AIDS. There needs to be
further targeting within these broad categories to emphasize health centers and outreach activities,
essential health interventions that lead to improvement of MDGs, and lowering financial barriers to
essential health care for the poor. Further investments in hospital capacity need to be carefully
considered as they have recurrent cost implications and their benefits are likely to accrue
disproportionately to the rich.

 156.    Education. Access to basic education, like basic health, is a vital part of Lao PDR's NGPES
and NSEDP. However, major challenges remain. As Figure 10 illustrates, net primary school
enrollment rates increased moderately from 61.1 percent in 1992/3 to 64.6 percent in 2002/3; and
literacy and months of education have also increased gradually over this period (see Figure 11).
Nevertheless, there are widespread disparities in access and outcomes. Children from low income,
minority ethnic groups (especially minority women) and rural areas remain less likely to be in school
than other children.

157.    There are currently no objective studies of student attainment, so the quality of school
outcomes cannot be directly measured. However, the quality and availability of inputs i s problematic.
Almost one-quarter of primary teachers are untrained, and education also suffers from non-attendance
by teachers (due inpart to the sometimes delayed payment of salaries). Shortage of school buildings i s
a problem and the number of primary schools has fallen since 2000. Despite improvements ininternal
efficiency, it i s proving difficult to keep children in school long enough to complete the cycle, and
Lao PDR has a very low proportion of students who complete the full cycle of primary and secondary
school.

158.    Although management problems play an important role, it i s clear that the slow improvement
of educational attainment also reflects the collapse in education spending in the late 1990s. Despite
the recovery over the last five years (with the education budget growing inreal terms by 12percent a
year), public educational expenditure has still not reached the levels of a decade ago, either inrelation
to GDP or as a proportion of total public spending. The dominant features of recent education public
expenditures are the high proportion of capital spending and the high percentage of that spending
financed by foreign aid. Even though the share of the recurrent budget allocated to salaries has
improved, the situation with teachers' pay remains a critical constraint, with the result that teaching
has become a financially unattractive career option. Also of concern i s the fact that public expenditure
per student varies considerably across provinces and does not appear to berelated to differences inthe
cost of provision or to the "needs" of students.

159.     The government of Lao PDR considers education a crucial priority and has identified it as one
of the pillars of its poverty reduction strategy. The government has a vision of implementing
compulsory primary education and progressively increasing participation at higher levels with
particular emphasis on lower secondary level. Reduction of disparities related to gender, geographical
location and ethnicity i s a key concern of the Government and its development partners. The
Government's policy priorities for the next phase of education reform and development include: (a)
expanding access to and participation in formal primary education, especially for girls, ethnic
minorities and poorest children; (b) selectively expanding access to and participation in lower
secondary education, especially for girls, ethnic minorities and poorest children; (c) improving the
quality and relevance of formal primary and lower secondary education; (d) raising the literacy level
of youth and adults and delivering skills development training in disadvantaged areas; (e)
strengthening decentralized education management; and (f) adjusting education expenditure in line
with sector priorities and development targets.



                                                    37

160.     As with the health sector, a critical requirement is for Lao PDR to increase the proportion of
national resources allocated to education. The projections made as part of the planning for "Education
for All" (EFA) emphasize the magnitude of the required expenditure increase, with salary increases
for teachers a highpriority. The NGPES indicated a target of 15 percent of the national budget. Like
basic health care spending, however, basic education spending in Lao PDR i s predominantly the
responsibility of provinces and sustained progress in increasing education spending in line with
national strategies will dependinpart on prior progress under the PEMSP.

161.      Infrastructure. Lao PDR's infrastructure was built up during the 1980s, financed by Soviet
assistance. The collapse of the Soviet Union and the breakdown of COMECON in the early 1990sput
an end to this funding, leading to a deterioration of the country's infrastructure through most of the
1990s. It took until the late 1990s for Government to mobilize the resources to reverse the declining
situation, largely from new foreign donors.

162.      Lao PDR is mostly mountainous and has a low population density (23 people per square
kilometer). Under these conditions, the development of road access for agriculture and international
trade i s especially important, but also challenging. Due to years of good effort, about 73 percent of the
national roads and 23 percent of the provincial roads are now in good or better conditions. However,
only 42 percent of the 7,200 km of national roads (of which 53 percent are paved) have been
rehabilitated or improved since 1990, and 3 percent of the local road network (24,000 km) i s paved.
More than 10percent of all district centers and over 40 percent of all villages do not have year-round
road access. Lack of road access to market is a major constraint for agricultural development.

 163.     NSC data on road kilometers (Figure 12) suggests that while between 1990 and 1995 the
length of tarred roads declinedby almost one quarter, the lengthrecovered after 1995 and was in2004
80 per cent higher than in 1990. However, World Bank analysis of LECS data suggests that rainy
season access to roads of households with expenditures around the poverty line dropped from almost
45 percent in 1992/3 to just over 25 percent in 1997/8, and had recovered only partially to just under
40 percent by 200213.

 164.     Following a period of stagnation in the early 1990s, rural electrification has increased
 significantly from about 16 percent of the national households in 1995 to approximately 47 percent by
the end of 2005, according to administrative statistics. This achievement, however, masks an uneven
development pattern in which Vientiane and other urban areas enjoy almost 100 percent coverage,
whilst only 25 percent of villages in rural areas have access to electricity. Village access to piped

                                                     38

water and protected wells increased by about 2 percent between 1997/8 and 2002/3 and progress was
even for poor and non-poor subgroups (Figure 13). However, access to such safe water for the poor
and for people living in priority districts lags non-poor and other districts. Simulations conducted in
the World Bank's Country Economic Memorandum (CEM) indicate that providing piped water and
electricity to all villages would lower poverty among the newly covered families by 8 percent.

165.      The NGPES and NSEDP clearly indicate the Government's commitment to strengthening
basic infrastructure. The Government has established a well-run Road Maintenance Fund (RMF), to
ensure a steady and adequate domestic funding source for road maintenance based on substantial
recovery of costs from road users. Plans are being elaborated to provide small towns with water and
sanitation services and the Ministry of Industry (MM) i s committed to expanding access to rural
electrification through the Rural Electrification Fund, for which a Government Decree was
promulgated inAugust, 2005.

166.      Pay reform.      Public sector pay remains extremely low in Lao PDR, both by historical
standards and in comparison with neighboring countries. For central government civil servants, non-
wage benefits and other sources of income may make government employment still attractive.
However, teachers and health workers are paid significantly less than regional averages and with
continuing delays in payment in some parts of the country. Many skilled public sector workers are
leaving their jobs for more lucrative employment, with vacancies remaining in key posts. Formal civil
service recruitment requires PMO authority, but the widespread use of contractual employment means
that it i s difficult for Government to control staffing increases through this channel.

167.       There i s growing pressure both for pay increases and for new recruitment to fill vacancies.
However, the limited data available makes it difficult for Government to produce accurate simulations
of the fiscal impacts of different pay and employment strategies. Furthermore, growth of the wage bill
i s necessarily constrained by the Government's ability to mobilize revenues.

Progress made under PRSO2

168.       Health. Under PRS02, the Ministry of Finance has issued clear instructions to provinces to
prioritize the payment of salaries for health care workers (as well as teachers-discussed below).
M O H has established a quarterly reporting system and has generated a report on salary payments by
province in the last quarter of FY05 and the first quarter of FY06. This suggests that Government has
paid out the salaries of health workers such that the stock of salaries outstanding more than 1month
came below 22 percent of a month's payroll; and that severe arrears in salaries (over three months)
have essentially been eliminated at less than one percent of a month's payroll. It i s clear that further
progress needs to be made. Nevertheless, Government has shown commitment and effort in tackling
this problem. M O H has formally approved the questionnaire for the Public Expenditure Tracking
Survey (PETS) including questions on timeliness of salary payments to health workers and this will
provide M O Hwith further data to assess and improve timeliness of salary payments.

 169.      A Curative Health Law was approved by the National Assembly in November 2005. It is a
"framework" law that clarifies the main responsibilities of different service providers in the health
sector, includes provisions for regulation of medical practice and expertise; introduces a referral
policy from lower level to higher level care; defines the rights and responsibilities of patients and
medical professionals, as well as the responsibilities of central and local government in the health
sector; identifies the main sources of financing in the health sector (including Government budget,
patient contributions, health insurance funds, social contributions and donor finance); and introduces
the concepts of free and paid medical care based on economic status of patients. Inthe context of the
PRSO program, two aspects of the law are particularly important. First, it establishes clearly the
various user fees that can be charged to the patient at the point of service. Second, it calls for

                                                      39

establishing "public assistancefunds" (equity funds) to protect the poor from the impact of user fees.
The law awaits ratification by the President.

170.    Since December 23,2005, user fees have been regulated by the Prime Minister Decree 381 on
Technical Revenues. This decree establishes rules for collection and management of "technical
revenues'' (user fees) by the Government agencies, including MOH. The user fee income can be used
for staff incentives and other operational costs. The user fee rates will be prepared by MOF in
consultation with respective line agencies and approved by the Government. According to officials of
MOH, this decree cancels Decree 52, which previously regulated healthuser charges.

171.    The Curative Health Law and the Decree 381 confirm the cost-recovery policies for
Government health facilities. They call for development of a more comprehensive user fee exemption
policy to protect the poor. Lao PDR has experimented with equity funds supported by Swiss Red
Cross and Belgian Technical Cooperation which pay for user fees for the poor. The World Bank
supported Health Services Improvement Project, which became effective in February 2006, provides
further support to equity funds.

172.    The Government has also decided to scale up Community Based Health Insurance (CBHI)
schemes. Pilots were conducted between 2002 and 2004 in three sites and they reached a coverage of
13 to 21 percent of catchment populations at a cost of about US$4 per capita per year. Donor-financed
CBHI schemes have sometimes fared badly once donor financing ended. The initiative in Lao PDR
may have better prospects, however. From the outset, they have relied only on community funding
sources and the administrative costs in the pilots have been kept low at under 10 percent. The pilots
were evaluated in several workshops and the Minister of Health issuedDecree No. 723 from April 13,
2005 on the nationwide implementation of CBHI. Although CBHI is not a poverty targeted program,
it could be an important risk-pooling and prepayment mechanism for the general population in rural
areas, to protect them from the impact of costs of disease or injury and facilitate access to service at
the time of need. The target under the NGPES for CBHI i s coverage of 15 percent of the population
by 2010.

 173.   The Government has not been able this year to deliver an increase in the health budget at
central and local levels as a share of the total state budget (including external financing). On the
contrary, whereas the FY2004-05 budget allocated 5.6 percent of the total state budget (including
external financing) to health, this fell to just 3.8 percent in the FY2005-06 budget. However, it i s
important to note that the cause of this reduction i s on the external (donor) financing side, over which
Government has limited control; and on the capital side of the health budget, where there i s a valid
reason for reduction in spending given Lao PDR's high hospital bed per capita ratio. The share of
domestically financed spending budgeted for health has remained constant between FY2004-05 and
FY2005-6 budgets at 2.6 percent of the total domestically financed budget. The share of recurrent
spending has remained constant between the two budgets at 1.3 percent of total domestic and external
state budget expenditure. Nevertheless, there has not been the needed increase in recurrent health
spending. The PRS03 commitment to develop a minimumper capita budget allocation for health (as
well as education) in all provinces will be an important step forward in ensuring that provinces
allocate more for basic health services.

 174.   Education. Regardingbudget allocations inthe FY2005-06 budget, there i s better news inthe
education sector. Under PRS02, the budget allocated 13.9 percent of total state budget (including
external financing) to the education sector for FY 2005-06. This i s a significant increase as a share of
total spending, up from 11percent of the state budget (including external financing) inFY 2004-05. It
i s a major step towards the NGPES target of 15 percent of the state budget (including external
financing) for education.



                                                   40

175.     The timeliness of the payment of primary teacher salaries has also improved markedly under
PRS02. MOE's quarterly report for October to December 2005 sets out the teacher salary amounts
planned and amounts transferred by province and by district. These data suggest that Government
paid the salaries of teachers such that the stock of salaries outstanding more than one month came
below 6 percent of a month's payroll in this quarter. Salary arrears of more than three months were
completely eliminated. This apparent improvement appears to be the result of strong commitment
from the central authorities to communicate the Government's priorities to the provincial authorities
that are responsible for these payments. The challenge now is to ensure the sustainability of this rate
of transfer and to verify that the salaries transferred to the districts are actually reaching the pockets of
teachers. Continued monitoring by MOE will be supplemented by the results of the PETS, which
includes questions on timeliness of salary payments for teachers.

176.     MOEhas initiated its multi-year textbook publishingprogram. The intention is to produce, for
the start of the 2006-07 school year, three new textbooks with accompanying teacher guides for Grade
1: Lao language, mathematics and social and natural science. The texts of these books were finalized
inDecember 2005, illustration and layout are under way and copies will be printed and distributed to
schools with financial support from the SecondEducationDevelopment Project (EDP2).

177.     MOE has launched a pilot community school grant program. This i s intended to lower the
cost of education for poor communities by providing community grants of 3 million kip per
community. Village Development Councils in 20 pilot communities have received training in the
process that they will use in arriving at a decision on the allocation of these grants. The first grants
will be paid out by May 2006.

178.     Infrastructure.    Under PRS02, progress has also been made regarding infrastructure
expenditure policy. To scale up off-grid rural electrification, the MIH has established a Rural
Electrification Fund (REF) with dedicated cash flow from repayments of the amounts on-lent to
beneficiaries under the first Southern Provinces Rural Electrification Project. Operational
management of the Rural ElectrificationFundwas contracted out to a management contractor selected
through international competitive bidding(with the contract signed on February 1, 2006).

 179.    Regarding water supply, the MCTPC has drafted a Water Supply Law, also addressing
sanitation and which will enable implementation decrees and regulations to draw on customary tribal
and ethnic law through extensive field research nationally. The draft law has been prepared with
support from UNESCAP, and builds on on-going research. The Government has shared the draft law
with donors and other stakeholders at a workshop inOctober 2005.

 180.    Regarding transport expenditure policy, MCTPC (with approval of MOF) has increased the
fuel levy for the Road Maintenance Fund (RMF) to 150 kipdliter. As RMF expenditures increase
gradually, effort i s required to raise the RMF revenues to more sustainable levels. The decision to
increase the fuel levy to 150 kips per liter was approved by the Government on November 7,2005 and
has been implemented.

 181.    MCTPC has updated the Road Preservation Plan, covering national and provincial roads. This
i s intended to ensure that the maintenance of the national and provincial roads i s well planned,
prioritized and budgeted. At present, the conservation program of the road networks of Lao PDR i s
almost entirely covered by the RMP2 program financed by the Government through the RMF, with
financial support from the World Bank, ADB and SIDA.

 182.    Pay reform.     FY2004-05 saw a 24 percent increase in the wage bill-largely               due to a
 significant pay increase. However, in the light of poor revenue performance this has created further



                                                      41

fiscal pressure, with the budget deficit kept on target only through tight rationing of cash and
consequent buildup of arrears innon-wage recurrent expenditures.

183.    Government still lacks a fully articulated strategy on pay and employment. Under PRS02,
however, the Government has started work on a Public Expenditure Review (discussed further
below). Among other issues, this i s considering options for reconciling pay increases with
employment changes and revenue growth.

Progressexpected under PRSO3

184.    Health. As discussed under sub-component 1.1 above, MOF, MOH, MOE and provinces
have agreed to develop and issue a guideline on minimum per capita budget allocations for
expenditures in health and education in all provinces, for introduction as part of the FY 2007/08
Budget. This will be a first step towards establishing a mechanism, consistent with the principle of
decentralization, by which government can ensure minimum service standards and expenditure
allocations to NGPESNSEDP priority programs in each province. While continuing to have
substantial discretion over the use of their budgets, provinces will be assisted to ensure that an
appropriate minimumis allocated for basic education and basic healthprograms.

185.     As part of the ongoing work on the Chart of Accounts and budget nomenclature, discussed
under Component 1 above, adjustments will be made in the chart of accounts and budget
nomenclature for the health sector, to link public expenditures with the levels of service delivery
(health centers, district hospitals, provincial hospitals) at provincial level. This will enable
Government to appropriately plan and monitor funding for essential health services that deliver the
NGPESNSEDP priority programs to the population.

 186.    In addition under PRS03, Government will improve the timeliness of payment of salaries to
health workers from the PRS02 benchmark of a stock of salaries outstanding more than 1month of 22
percent. This will require ongoing quarterly monitoring of provinces by M O H and dialogue with
laggingprovinces to identify issues and find solutions.

 187.    Other health sector intentions under PRS03 include the issuing of implementation
instructions for equity fund operations based on the new Curative Health Law and Decree 381,
includingupdating the exemption policy, guidelines for identification of the poor and setting rates of
user fees.

 188.    Education. As noted inthe discussion of health above, under PRS03 MOF, MOE, MOHand
provinces have agreed to develop and issue a guideline on minimumper capita budget allocations for
education and health programs in all provinces, for introduction as part of the FY 2007/08 Budget.

 189.    As also noted above, Government will improve the timeliness of payment of salaries to
teachers and health workers from the new benchmarks established in PRS02 (in the case of teachers,
a stock of salaries outstanding more than 1month of 6 percent of one month's payroll). Government
will continue quarterly monitoring of these data, sharing reports with the World Bank. As noted
above, Government has also launched the Public Expenditure Tracking Survey which will provide
further insights into the extent to which and timeliness with which salaries are reaching the pockets of
teachers and health workers.

 190.    Other education commitments under PRS03 include adopting an integrated framework and
plan for an Education Management Information System (EMIS); and evaluating the pilot community
grant program with a view to scale-up. A robust EMIS will be critical to linking national pro-poor
priorities for education to the allocation of resources at the provincial, district and school levels, and


                                                    42

then monitoring the resulting outcomes. The community grant program i s a step towards more
participatory local decision-making inresource allocation inprimary education.

191.     Infrastructure. Under PRS03, the MM will draw up and present to PMO plans for opening
the Rural Electrification Fund to other donors and private investors. Presently, the Rural
Electrification Fund has as its sole mandate to implement electrification plans directed by MM and
financed by IDA and consumer contributions. However, it is recognized that there i s scope for
attracting additional funding for rural electrification from non-traditional sources, if mechanisms are
devised to meld concessionary funding with private funding at moderate commercial rates. It i s
expected that community groups and private service companies can contribute to MM's own
electrification efforts if such groups and companies are allowed access to the Rural Electrification
Fund.

192.     Regarding water supply and sanitation, MCTPC will submit the Water Supply and Sanitation
Law to the National Assembly. This will allow consolidation of water supply related legislation
currently scattered across more than 130 pieces of separate legislation; clarify the regulatory
environment for water; enable greater private sector and community participation in and management
of water supply; clarify responsibility and establish the right of access to basic water supply,
sanitation and wastewater services; and strengthen the legal basis for the provision of sanitation
services. The inclusion of sanitation within the Water Supply Law will facilitate future
implementation decrees assigning responsibility for sanitation nationally to a single government
agency.

193.     Inthe transport sector, MCTPCwill increase the fuel levy for the RMFto 200 kipdliter, and
possibly to 300 kipdliter. It is important that the Government continues to raise the fuel levy toward
the full cost recovery level. To ensure that these funds are well spent, MCTPC will once again update
the Road Preservation Plan, covering national and provincial roads. Finally, MCTPC will prepare a
draft Ministerial Directive on Rural Transport Services, building on the policy statement on rural
transport services prepared duringPRS02.

 194.    Pay reform. Government recognizes the need to balance pay increases and new recruitment
with revenue enhancement. To this end, they have deferred any further increases in base salaries in
2005/06. There are plans to recruit an additional 8,000 employees for priority sectors (education and
health); however, efforts will be made to rein in recruitment of contractual employees by the
provinces. The planned recruitment of additional staff will be conditional on a satisfactory revenue
outturn inthe first semester.

 195.    Under PRS03, and with support from UNDP, the Government will conduct a civil service
census as the baseline for a new civil service database. Building on this data and on the PER, it i s
hoped that the PMO and MOF can prepare a civil service pay reform policy consistent with the
medium-termfiscal framework.

End-of-series outcomes

 196.    The end-of-series outcomes targeted by the PRSO programunder this sub-component are:

         (a) improved intermediate health indicators;

         (b) strengthenedexpenditure planning and execution for healthpriorityprograms;

2.2: Monitoring the Alignment of Spending with Pro-Poor NGPES/NSEDP Priorities

Key issues and Government reform strategy

197.    Strengthening public expenditure policy in Lao PDR requires a concerted effort to strengthen
systems for monitoring the alignment of spending with pro-poor NGPESNSEDP priorities. This
includes efforts to strengthen tracking and analysis of public expenditure; and efforts to improve the
quality of poverty data and broader statistical reporting systems.

198.    Tracking public spending. As discussed under Component 1, the administrative systems for
public expenditure tracking remain under development and the data produced by them is of uncertain
quality and accuracy. Although progress i s being made in implementing the new Government
Financial Information System (GFIS) at provincial level, there are currently limits to the accessibility,
manipulability and accuracy of this data. As part of its commitments under the Nam Theun 2 project,
the Government has undertaken to conduct a Public Expenditure Tracking Survey (PETS)jointly with
donors every two years, to obtain more accurate and informative data on public expenditure policy
and management practices in provinces and districts on a periodic basis. Also as part of NT2
commitments, Government has undertaken to conduct a Public Expenditure Review (PER) jointly
with donors every two years, to examine public expenditure trends and support the Government to
achieve its key development objectives by strengthening public financial management practices.

199.    The Government has decided that the first PETS will be focused on health and education, and
will aim at (a) understanding and analyzing current public expenditure management practices and (b)
serving as an independent monitoring tool to assist government in improving accountability in service
delivery. The 200516 PER will aim (a) to review macro-fiscal performance and sustainability as well
as the intra- and inter-sectoral allocation of public spending at the central and local levels; (b) review
the institutional framework for public expenditure management; and (c) conduct intra-sectoral
analysis of public resources for NGPESNSEDP priority sectors, including assessing the quality of
core public services and the efficiency of their delivery.

200.    Poverty data. Effective implementation of the NGPESNSEDP, as well as progress towards
MDGs, will require careful collection and monitoring of socio-demographic statistics (population,
health, education, poverty and labor market statistics). InLao PDR, statistics are the responsibility of
the National Statistical Center (NSC). Lao PDR follows international conventions in conducting a
population census every ten years; and an Expenditure and Consumption Survey every five years.
These surveys are of good quality. However, NSC i s still in the process of putting in place the
procedures required to institutionalize a modern, more thorough-going and timely statistical reporting


                                                    44

system. Current data dissemination practices do not yet provide for the timely availability of data or
its access to the broader public.

Progressmade under PRSO2

201.      Tracking public spending. Under PRS02, Government and donors have launched and
completed the majority of the fieldworks for both the PETS and the PER exercises. The PETS
questionnaires were developed, tested, finalized and approved by MOE, MOH, MOF and the PMO
between August and December 2005. Training for survey enumerators was conducted between
December 26, 2005 and January 7, 2006. The PETS survey data collection was launched on January
31, 2006 and will be completed in March or April 2006. The PER fieldwork was conducted during
missions in September 2005, November 2005 and January 2006, with intensive collaboration between
Government and donors and participatory workshops held as part of each mission. The PER report
itself will be drafted jointly by MOF, the World Bank, ADB and IMF in the period to May 2006.
There will be further widespread consultation across Government-at       the central and local levels-
and with international and local development partners before the report i s finalized and published.

202.      Poverty data. Under PRS02, CPI approved and issued a Statistical Strategy consistent with
international standards in producing and disseminating data. This will lay the foundations for a
strengthening of statistical information available for monitoring and evaluating progress with national
growth and poverty eradication. The NSC has prepared the Statistical Strategy, with support from
Statistics Sweden. This has been approved and issued by the CPI.

Progressexpected under PRSO3

203.      Tracking public spending. Under PRS03, MOF, M O H and NSC will report on PETS and
PER findings and will launch preparation for further PETS and PER exercises. The World Bank has
agreed to provide technical support for the initial PETS and PER exercises, and for follow on
exercises every two years.

204.      Poverty data. Under PRSO3, the National Statistical Center will remain on track with
implementing the Statistical Strategy. The government (CPI and NSC) has agreed to World Bank
 support of this strategy by a TFSCB (Trust Fund for Statistical Capacity Building) grant, with
coordination between the Bank, SIDA and possibly IMF to contribute to different parts of the
 statistics strategy. The grant in the amount of USD 349,025 (TF053421) was approved on December
 22, 2005, and will be operational from April 1, 2006 untilMarch 31, 2009.

End-of-series outcomes

 205.     The end-of-series outcomes targeted by the PRSO programunder this sub-component are:

          (a) policymakers who are better informed about effectiveness of social sector spending; and

          (b) enhancedtransparency and accountability.

 Component 3: Strengthening Private Sector Development

 3.1: Strengthening Private Sector Development

Key issuesand Government reform strategy

 206.     Business environment.      Stronger private sector development in Lao PDR will require
concerted efforts to improve the environment for business and investment. The comparative cost of

                                                    45

doing business in Lao PDR i s high. While Lao PDR has cheaper labor costs, it has higher average
transport, telecommunication and rental costs than other East Asian countries. While electricity i s
relatively cheap, the quality of service i s low and installation costs are high. Medium and large scale
enterprises find it difficult to operate due to the following constraints:        cumbersome and time-
consuming regulatory procedures and out-dated legislative framework; limited provincial government
capacity and over-bearing inspections regime; poor access to finance; limited domestic markets; poor
infrastructure especially the poor quality roads and bridges incapable of supporting container trucks
for export to regional markets; limited market information; and low levels of entrepreneur capacity.
The recent "Doing Business" database of the World Bank shows that while the number of procedures
involved i s roughly comparable to other countries, the number of days involved in starting up a
business inLao PDR i s almost four times the regional average.Farmers have difficulty in getting their
produce to market or transporting it across the border.

207.     As reflected inthe NGPES and the draft NSEDP2006-10, the Government recognizes the key
role of the private sector in growth and poverty reduction. For this reason, in the medium-term, the
Government plans to: (a) give private sector equal rights and reduce entry restrictions for private
firms to most of the sectors; (b) facilitate private sector development through a more favorable policy
environment and level playing field and by streamlining registration and licensingprocedures for new
firms; (c) remove remaining biases inadministrative procedures and regulations that favor SOEs over
domestic or foreign private firms; (d) strengthen market institutions, including dispute resolution and
contract enforcement; (e) facilitate the registration and licensing process for investors, and to equalize
domestic and foreign investors; (f) improve land rights and the use of land as a collateral; and (g) to
promote and increase exports and facilitate trade and regional integration.

208.     Under PRSO1, the Government has revised the Domestic and Foreign Investment Laws
(October 2004) and established the process of semi-annual dialogue between the Government and the
private sector. The revisions to the investment laws have extended the investment term for foreign
investors to 50 (from 15) years, required a more rapid screening of investment applications interms of
specific number of days, decentralized investment approvals to the provinces for smaller size
investment applications, and made more explicit and clear the guidelines on land rights and uses.
Nevertheless, these revised Laws fall short in key regards: approval i s still very discretionary and i s
based on licensing rather than registration principle; decisions do not follow a transparent "negative
list" of restricted sectors; and there are not adequate dispute resolution processes. Also, the
availability of incentives for investors i s not sufficiently circumscribedby a central control, to ensure
that the tax base i s not eroded.

209.     Financial sector.     Stronger private sector development in Lao PDR also needs the
development of a larger, healthier and more diverse financial sector. Currently, the financial sector
comprises banks, one state-owned insurance company, numerous foreign exchange bureaus, and a
social security fund. Non-Bank Financial Institutions (NBFIs), such as leasing companies, do not yet
exist and the size and reach of financial markets i s very limited. Credit to the economy i s below 10
percent of GDP with about 70 percent of total credit allocated to the private sector. Saving i s about 15
percent of GDP. The level of monetization of the economy i s low and confidence in the formal
financial sector limited. Microfinance i s not well developed.

210.     Access to finance i s limited. It i s estimated that about 2 percent of total population have
access to credit from formal to semi-formal financial sector. Firmsheavily rely on retained earnings to
finance working capital and new investment. Smaller firms rely even more heavily on retained
earnings. To enhance access to finance by Lao people, the Government envisaged a sustainable,
diverse, competitive microfinance industry. The BOL issued the Microfinance Regulation in June
2005 to implement the Rural and Microfinance Policy and Action Plan endorsed by the PMO inearly
2004. The regulation provides an enabling environment for the microfinance industry, promotes

                                                      46

commercial operations and encourages diverse forms and types of ownership of MFIs. However
uncertainty remains as to whether BOL will be required to revise the regulation to restrict foreign
investment in the microfinance industry based on the guidance of a notice issued by the PMO in
October 2005.

211.    The current legal and regulatory framework does not provide the Lao banking sector with
level competition. Restrictions on the activities of non-state banks and market segmentation remain in
force. Foreign banks are still restricted from expanding their branch network as the proposed
amendment to the Presidential Decree on Commercial Banks was not enacted. The Presidential
Decree Law 01 governing the management of foreign exchange and precious metals requires
businesses dealing with mining and exporting of natural resources to open deposit accounts only with
state banks. The SCBs are, accordingly, still protected from the competitive pressures that would
motivate the SCBs to improve their efficiency. Therefore it i s important to promote competition inthe
financial sector and to encourage privately-owned financial institutions in addition to restructuring
State Commercial Banks (SCBs) and improving bank regulation and supervision, discussed under
sub-component 1.2. The draft NSEDP 2006-10 generally supports level competition in the banking
sector through removal of remaining legal and regulatory impediments to entry and expansion by non-
statebanks.

212.    Under PRSO1, the amendment to the Decree of the President on Commercial Banks was
submitted by the Prime Minister's Office in February 2005 to the Standing Committees of the
National Assembly (although this has not yet been approved). The proposed amendments aim to
ensure a leveling of the playing field between state and non-state banks and reduce barriers to entry
and competition from non-state banks. In addition, the BOL disseminated the Rural and Microfinance
Policy and Action Plan inthree provinces.

Progress achieved under PRSO2

213.    Business environment.     Under PRS02, during the October 2005 legislative session, the
National Assembly approved a new Enterprise Law, replacing the 1995 Business Law. The new
Enterprise Law creates a level playing field for private businesses, significantly simplifies regulations
and procedures to start up a business, moves from licensing to registration as the main principle,
envisages a transparent "negative list" of the sectors where entry of private business is conditional,
and creates a one-stop-shop for business registration.

214.     Both the Enterprise Law and Domestic and Foreign Investment Laws (implementing decrees
for which were issued at the end of 2005) include positive features. However, it should be noted that
there are also some shortcomings and inconsistencies. For example, while the Enterprise Law reduces
the number of licenses and substitutes them with post-establishment registration, the Investment Laws
introduce an additional investment license for domestic investors and keeps a licensing regime. While
both sets of legislation envisage a one-stop-shop, the Enterprise Law and Investment Laws place it in
a different government agency. The Investment Laws envisage a "positive list" of industries with
restricted entry, instead of "negative list". These inconsistencies are unfortunate and Government
recognizes that they will need to be resolved through further review of the InvestmentLaws.

215.     Government drafted a regulation to promote sustainable private investment inmining and this
was adopted by the MM in December 2005. It i s intended to encourage sustainable development of
private investment inmining, eliminating bottlenecks that impede development of this sector.

216.    Government prepared for the first semi-annual business forum by conducting central and
provincial private sector focus groups. This process i s intended to foster dialog between private sector
and government and greater confidence amongst private sector businesses. A responsible inter-


                                                    47

ministerial committee was established by a Decision of CPI in mid-2005. With support from the
Mekong Private Sector Development Facility (MPDF), working group meetings have been conducted
with the representatives of the private sector in three of the four sectors (tourism, manufacturing,
service and trading) and discussions in energy and mining will be held starting from the next Forum.
The first semi-annual business forum is scheduled for April, 2006.

217.     Financial sector. The National Assembly approved the revised Secured Transaction Law in
May 2005 and the law became effective in August 2005. The amendments expand and clarify eligible
loan collateral. The revisedlaw will be implemented following issuance of implementingregulations.

Progress expected under PRSO3

218.     Business environment.    Under the PRS03, the Government will make progress towards
implementation of the new Enterprise Law, including approval of an implementation action plan,
issuance of implementing decrees and regulations and development of a short "negative list". The
Government will also review the existing laws with a view to harmonizing the Foreign and Domestic
InvestmentLaws with the new Enterprise Law.

219.     The MOF will submit a draft Accounting Law to the National Assembly. This i s intended to
ensure that enterprise accounting moves in the direction of international accounting standards. The
Law on Business Accounting and Auditing i s currently being drafted with support from an IDF grant
administered by the World Bank. It i s important that the law clarifies the clause for SMEs that
stipulates simplified requirements on accounting for small and micro firms.

220.     Government will continue to conduct the semi-annual business forums, building on the
participatory process ongoing now, enabling a direct dialog between the Government and the private
sector. This process will continue to be supported by MPDF. This dialog is especially important in
Lao PDR and will support the Government's efforts to give more prominence to the private sector and
its role in growth and poverty reduction.

221.     Financial sector. The BOL plans to draft a new Financial Institutions Law and amendments
to the PresidentialDecree Law Governing the Management of ForeignExchange and Precious Metals.
This aims to remove legal impediments to level competition inthe banking sector. While Government
agrees in principles to promote level competition in the banking sector, the Standing Committees of
the National Assembly will not consider the proposed amendments to the Presidential Decree on
Commercial Banks until the BOL resubmits the revised amendments in a manner consistent with the
recently enacted Enterprise Law. Besides these technical revision, BOL plans to upgrade the status of
this PresidentialDecree on Commercial Banks into a Law for all financial institutions. Inaddition to
the main Banking Law, BOL i s expected to prepare draft amendments to the Presidential Decree Law
No.Ol/OP. The current Decree Law requires businesses dealing with mining and exporting of natural
resources to open deposit accounts with state banks only, with additional restrictions on foreign
exchange.

End-of-series outcomes

222.     The end-of-series outcomes targeted by the PRSO programunder this sub-component are:

          (a) enhancedcompetitive environment for private sector development;

          (b) greater confidence amongst private sector operators; and

         (c) increased diversity and competition of non-state financial institutions.

3.2: Accelerating Regionaland Global Integration

Key issues and Government reform strategy

223.     Maintaining the momentum of trade reform will play a crucial role in growth and poverty
reduction inLao PDR, particularly given the country's strategic location between Thailand, China and
Vietnam. The Government recognizes the importance of both regional and global integration. At the
regional level, Lao PDR i s a member of the ASEAN Free Trade Area (AFTA). At the global level,
Lao PDR i s committed to achieving World Trade Organization (WTO) accession as early as possible
and has started formal negotiations.

224.     AFTA membership includes obligations to liberalize trade with other members on set
schedules and according to potential imports classified on four lists, including (i) Inclusion List
                                                                                   an
(IL)of goods immediately eligible for preferential treatment under certain conditions; and (ii)     a
Temporary Exclusion List (TEL) of goods which must be moved to the ILaccording to a set schedule.
Each member specifies a Common Effective Preferential Tariff (CEPT) for each IL and TEL item,
and IL items can be imported at this rate-exempt from all non-tariff barriers-under specified
conditions.

225.     The four new ASEAN (ASEAN-4) members are committed to moving all TEL items to the IL
and setting all ILrates to 0-5 percent by 2008. Lao PDR has been integrating gradually into the world
economy since 1989. The reform process accelerated after Lao PDR's accession to ASEAN and the
joining of AFTA in July 1997. The country started to implement the AFTA Common Effective
Preferential Tariff (CEPT) scheme in January 1998, and has completed the moving of the TEL to the
ILaheadof schedule.LaoPDRwill complete the liberalizationscheduleby2008, reducingits tariff
on imports from ASEANcountries to 0-5 percent.

226.     At the same time, Lao PDR is makingprogress with global trade integration. Lao PDR signed
a Bilateral Trade Agreement with the United States (USBTA) in 2003, which required the
Government to open up its services sector over time. At the same time, Lao PDR was granted Normal
Trade Relations by the U S Congress in November 2004. The Government i s drafting an action plan
for WTO accession.

227.     Government notes that import licenses are now limited to only four products: fuel, cement,
steel and vehicles. However, it recognizes that more needs to be done to address additional regulatory
requirements imposed by provinces: Bank staff estimate that there are some 214 non-tariff measures
at the provincial level.

Progressmade under PRSO2

228.     Under PRS02, Government has made some progress towards WTO accession. The
government has initiated the preparation of the following checklist documents for WTO accession:
ACC/4     (agricultural subsidies); ACC/8      (illustrative TBT/SPS measures); ACC/9          (TRIPS
implementation); and ACC/5 (Services). In addition, as discussed below, the National Assembly has
approved the new Customs Law, designed to implement the transaction value principle, as well as
facilitate customs modernization more generally (WTO rules require all members to use the
transaction value principle when assessing ad valorem customs duties).

229.     Government has also continued to implement AFTA commitments. A draft Resolution was
submitted to the October session of the National Assembly, including a schedule of phased tariff
reductions consistent with AFTA commitments, with all tariffs for items in the inclusion list reaching
the 0-5 percent range by 2008. All remaining tariffs in the Temporary Exclusion List have been


                                                   49

moved to the Inclusion List (the fourth installment took place in early 2004, and the fifth and last
installment in early 2005). The fifth installment transfer to the IL has been approved in principle by
the National Assembly but has not yet beenratified by the Standing Committee which will convene in
July 2006.

Progress expected under PRSO3

230.    Under PRS03, Government will make further progress towards WTO accession. This will
include application; drafting the legislative action plan; finalizing the checklist documents; and
starting implementing the legislative action plan. In addition, Government will conduct economic
analysis to support market access and other aspects of negotiations, with support from the World
Bank and other donors. The Government hopes to organize a secondWorking Party Meeting on WTO
accession during 2006. The process of WTO accessionwill, however, runbeyondthe timelines of this
first PRSO series. In addition, Government will stay on track with implementation of AFTA
commitments, including preparing its justification for those products to be kept on the General
Exclusion list and submittingthis for approval to the ASEAN Secretariat.

End-of-series outcome

231.     The end-of-series outcome targeted by the PRSO programunder this sub-component is:

         (a) greater liberalization intrade regime.

3.3: Improving Resource Management

Key issues and Government reform strategy

232.     Revenue management. Lao PDR's revenue to GDP ratio i s among the lowest in the region at
 11percent of GDP (excluding grants). A major challenge is to mobilize revenues to enable Lao PDR
to meet its poverty reduction and growth objectives within a sustainable fiscal framework, consistent
with the need to reduce Lao PDR's highpublic debt.

233.     A small addition to Government revenues (perhaps an additional half percent of GDP) will be
made by the Nam Theun 2 hydroelectric project, starting in FY2009. However, Government
recognizes that this i s insufficient on its own and that further as well as earlier measures are needed to
increase revenue effort. There i s broad consensus on the need to centralize the collection of major
taxes such as customs and turnover tax. The latter in any case i s a pre-requisite for the planned
implementation of a Value-Added Tax (VAT) in 2008/09. The initial focus should be on improving
oversight of large and medium taxpayers; and on establishing an effective, centralized tax
identification number (TIN) system, initially in the national Large Tax Payer Unit and the three
largest provincial tax offices.

234.     However, it i s clear that this needs to be addressed as part of a broader review of central-local
fiscal relations. As discussed under sub-component 1.1, above, some of these issues are being
considered as part of the planned Budget Law revisions. However, substantial reform of the central-
local fiscal system i s likely to require an ongoing multi-year process.

235.     For the longer-term, better management of natural resources and better administration of
associatedtaxes and royalties, could make an important contribution to Lao PDR's revenues as well
as supporting environmental and social goals.

236.     Forest management. Forests are a significant and vital resource for Lao PDR. Communities
depend upon them for land, employment and income. Deforestation, forest degradation, loss of

                                                     50

biodiversity and soil erosion are serious environmental challenges with important implications for the
livelihoods of rural populations. Inaddition, forests are a significant revenue source for Lao PDR-
and one with significant growth potential. Royalty revenues have been declining since the mid-1990s.
It is estimated that, over the last five years, the Government has realized only about one third of the
estimated market value of the timber harvested.

237.     Government controls virtually all forest land in Lao PDR, playing a leading role in forest
production decisions and taking a major role inprocessing and trade. Policy toward forestry has been
shifting over time and seems headedtoward a more market-oriented and pro-poor approach. Since the
199Os, approximately 3.2 million hectares of largely forested land have been designated as National
Conservation Areas, covering 20 different sites. However, management planning for these areas has
advanced slowly and few areas are managed under long term, approved plans with adequate
resources. This leaves these areas subject to encroachment and erosion from a number of threats,
includingillegal logging, huntingand agricultural conversion.

238.      In 2002, the Government established legal provisions for the establishment of a system of
National Production Forest Area (PFA). Eight sites (totaling around 656,000 hectares) have been
identified for designation as PFA and management planning has begun, although to date none have
been formally established under the requiredprocedures. Despite some reforms, timber sales practices
remain controlled and ineffective. An annual national log production quota system remains in place,
administered by the Prime Minister's Office that allocates harvests to provinces. However, the quota
system i s subject to manipulation, does not buildfrom forest management plans based on appropriate
surveys, inventory and harvest prescriptions, and does not provide incentives for preparation and
implementation of sustainable managementprograms.

239.      Timber produced under the quota is to be processed domestically to achieve increased value
added transactions. The conduct of timber sales auctions, sales contracts and payment procedures
need to be improved and brought into line with commercial practices inother sectors.

240.      Under PRSO1, MAF completed requirements for independent certification of sustainable
forest management in pilot village forests in Khammouane and Savannakhet provinces with the total
area of 45,000 hectares.

Progress made under PRSO2

241.      Revenue Management. Under PRS02, the National Assembly approved the new Customs
Law. As noted above, this law establishes the transaction value principle (required for WTO
accession) but also facilitates customs modernization more generally including clarifying the roles
and responsibilities of the center and the provinces. Progress has been made to strengthen capacity at
customs headquarters in Vientiane. These reforms include the appointment of a third Deputy Director
General to oversee customs operations in the provinces; the creation of a new post-clearance audit
division, and a proposal to create permanent inspection units in customs posts to improve internal
controls. However, customs administration remains decentralized. This seriously impedes the
effectiveness of revenue mobilization and remittancefrom this source.

242.      Tax administration is also decentralized, with similar consequences. In fact aspects of the
new 2005 Tax Law codify and entrench the powers of the provincial governors in respect of the tax
departments. This may well aggravate existing collection, recording and remittance problems. The
law as drafted i s also an impediment to tax administration reforms reflecting modem international
practices such as self assessment.




                                                    51

243.    Forest Management.       Under PRS02, the Government has established a Forest Sector
Monitoring System and i s ready to field test this system. It aims at enhancing forest resources
sustainability and community participationinforest managementand consists of several elements: (a)
forest cover monitoring; (b) internal forest control and compliance; (c) chain of custody timber
identification and tracking; and (d) and forest law enforcement reporting. Technical equipment for all
aspects of the monitoring system has been put in place; a methodology and technical guidelines have
been completed; and national and provincial level staff has been trained.

244.     Based on the results of field testing, monitoring operational guidelines and implementation
instructions will have to be finalized. MAF and the Science and Technology Agency (STEA) have
agreed on the respective roles of the two agencies in implementing the forest monitoring system and
specific tasks of the two agencies have been detailed inthe annual work plan.

Progress expected under PRSO3

245.     Revenue Management. Regardingrevenue management, it i s envisaged that under PRS03 the
Government will issue implementing decrees and regulations for the new Customs Law. Inparticular,
a process will be put under way to establish regional customs offices to help coordination with the
provinces and complement ongoing reforms at central level; and to implement the proposal to create
permanent inspection units in customs posts to improve internal controls. Progress will also be made
on establishing the centralized Tax Payer Identification Number.

246.     Forest Management. The Department of Forestry within MAF will field test the forest
management information system duringPRS03. Field testing will be conducted in four provinces as
part of an approved annual work plan for the Sustainable Forestry for Rural Development (SWORD)
Project.

247.     Second, the Government will prepare a Forest Industry Restructuring Plan to rationalize
industrial capacity and resource supply. It i s expected that this plan will strengthen efforts to reduce
the number and wood processing capacity of mills dependent on wood supply from natural forests. A
three step process, consisting of 1) administrative mill reduction; 2) market-based mill reduction and
3) economic restructuringhas been identified and needs to be developed further into a time-bound and
costed restructuring program. Administratively, wood processing industry licensing may consider
limiting wood processing licenses to mills that meet certain basic criteria-mills       using advanced
technology to produce high-value wood products for export markets, mills with demonstrated
efficiency in using raw material (e.g. high recovery rates), etc. Using market-based approaches,
provincial timber sales committees might only invite mills with current year wood processing licenses
to participate in competitive bidding for the limited, available wood supply. The competitive bidding
process would be a second, market-based, means of reducing the number and processing capacity of
mills. It i s likely that only efficient mills, producing high value-added products, and with good
linkages to markets, will be able to compete successfully for the available wood supply. Millsthat are
unsuccessful in biddingon timber sales, because they are less efficient and not cost-effective, may be
forced to cease operations due to insufficient wood supply. Finally, it i s expected that Government
will consider initiating and promoting alternative (forest-based) economic activities in areas where
logging and sawmilling have contracted to provide for people displaced by restructuring of forestry
and wood processing sectors.

End-of-series outcomes

248.    The end-of-series outcomes targeted by the PRSO programunder this sub-component are:

        (a)     strengthening fiscal policy and tax collection; and

        (b)     enhanced sustainability and participation in forest management.

                           VI.      OPERATIONIMPLEMENTATION

POVERTY AND SOCIAL IMPACTS
249.    Poverty and Social Impact Analysis (PSIA) i s being conducted as part of the Lao Poverty
Assessment as well as the 2005/6 Public ExpenditureReview (PER) and the 2006 Public Expenditure
Tracking Survey (PETS).

250.    The Lao Poverty Assessment (LAOPA) i s nearing completion. It finds strong evidence of a
relationship between poverty and certain characteristics in Lao PDR. In particular, it finds that the
education of the household head and spouse are strongly correlated with poverty. For example, the
share of heads of household without any schooling i s 75 percent larger in2002/3 than among the non-
poor. This compares with only about 50 percent in 1992/3, suggesting that some schooling has
become more important for escaping poverty. LAOPA also finds a strong correlation between poverty
and rural infrastructure: in 2002/3, the poor were on average 6.7 kilometers away from a road,
compared with only 2.9 percent for the non-poor. In addition, the poor are more likely to live in a
village without electricity (45 percent) or a primary school (7 percent). As such, the PSIA work
conducted as part of LAOPA tends to confirm the poverty reduction benefits of prioritizing sectors
such as basic education, ruraltransport and rural electrification.

251.    The 2005/6 PER and 2006 PETS are also conducting analysis of poverty impact of social
sector spending. Fieldwork for both of these exercises i s currently ongoing, and the results are not yet
available. However, the PER i s expected to include benefit-incidence analysis for the main social
sector programs; and the PETS will provide further data on benefit-incidence in the health and
education sectors.

IMPLEMENTATION, MONITORING AND EVALUATION

252.    The implementation of the PRSO program i s led by the PRSO Steering Committee, which i s
chaired by the Minister of Finance. The Steering Committee i s supported by a PRSO Technical
Secretariat, which is chaired by the Director General of the External Finance Relations Department of
the Ministry of Financeand includes representation from across Government.

253.    Progress with the PRSO program implementation i s monitored with reference to the PRSO
Program Matrix, updated annually as part of PRSO negotiations. Accordingly, this second Program
Document in the series of three PRSOs includes a revised policy reform matrix, building on that
developed for PRSOl but updated jointly by Government, IDA and other donors, to reflect evolving
policies and the pace of implementation of the NGPES (Annex 2). In addition to monitoring of
progress against policy actions, there i s close monitoring of macroeconomic developments, as well as
poverty and social indicators. Sub-component 2.2 of the PRSO Program Matrix includes measures to
strengthen such monitoring indicators.

254.    In accordance with standard practice for PRSOs, the impact of this PRSO series will be
evaluated in accordance with a Monitoring and Evaluation (M&E) framework covering all three
operations in the series and established by the Government and IDA at the time of PRSO1. The end-

                                                   53

of-series outcomes expected under each sub-component of the PRSO program are recorded in the
revised PRSO matrix (Annex 2). Although adjustments have been made to the policy actions in the
Program Matrix, these actions remain consistent with the end-of-series outcomes which were agreed
and fixed in the first Program Document of the series and which remain unaltered. The indicators
against which progress against these outcomes will be measured have been strengthened as part of the
PRS02 dialogue, and the enhanced indicators and baselines are also reflected in the revised PRSO
matrix.

255.     M&E activities will be coordinated by the PRSO Steering Committee and Technical
Secretariat, supported by the National Statistical Center (NSC). However, the World Bank and other
donors will monitor progress through continuous dialogue throughout the year, including periodic
supervision missions. The IMFwill continue to conduct enhanced supervision, supplementing annual
Article IV missions with mid-year assessments.

FIDUCIARY ASPECTS
Publicfinancialmanagement

256.     The 2005/6 PER incorporates an integrated fiduciary assessment for Lao PDR, and i s in
progress. The preliminary conclusion i s that the overall fiduciary risk inLao PDR remains highdue to
weakness in the basic financial management systems of government. The Government has formally
approved the Public Expenditure Management Strengthening Program (PEMSP) in 2005 and
implementation i s in progress. Progress in implementing recommended actions i s contributing to
reducing the fiduciary risk but this still remains high.Major recommendations aimed at improving the
public financial management systems, including the efficiency and transparency of use of public
resources, are reflected in the PEMSP supported by the PRSO program. The challenge will be in
effectively implementing the recommendations. Active monitoring of the strengthening program
initiatives by the Government i s critical. Enhancing and strengthening of public financial management
systems is a medium to long term process which will extend beyond the period of the envisaged
PRSOs.

Foreignexchangecontrolenvironment inthe centralbank

257.     The last IMF Safeguard Assessment of the Central Bank (Bank of Laos), which was
conducted in 2003, classified the risk as being medium-high in all five categories on which the
assessment was based (external audit mechanism, legal structure and independence, financial
reporting framework, internal audit mechanism and internal control system). Progress on the
safeguard recommendations has been slow, and the agreedjoint audit of the Bank of Lao PDR's 2003
and 2004 accounts by the State Auditor and an international audit firm has not been done. The
authorities have indicated that they are not in a position to implement this agreement on the audits.
There i s also tightening of the liquidity situation due to sharply accelerating credit growth at the State
Commercial Banks in2005.

258.     Inview of the highfiduciary risks,as detailedinthe minutes ofnegotiation, the Recipient will
maintain a dedicated deposit account for the proceeds of the Grant, and will report on the funds flow
of the dedicated deposit account. The Government will, if considered necessary by IDA, allow an
independent external audit of the dedicated foreign currency deposit account.

DISBURSEMENT,REPORTINGAND AUDITING
259.     The recipient i s the Lao People's Democratic Republic. A single tranche grant of SDR 5.6
million (US$ 8.0 million equivalent) will be made available upon grant effectiveness, anticipated for



                                                     54

July 2006. The closing date of the operation will be February 2007. It i s envisaged that there will be a
further single-tranche, annual PRSO of US$8 million equivalent duringthe World Bank's FY2007.

260.     The Grant proceeds will be disbursed against satisfactory implementation of the development
policy program and the stipulated release conditions of PRS02. The grant proceeds will not be tied to
any specific purchases. As detailed in the minutes of negotiation, the Recipient will maintain a
dedicated Deposit Account in US dollars at the Bank of Laos (which i s the Central Bank of the
Government), as part of the general foreign currency reserves of the government, and the Grant
proceeds will be deposited by IDA into that Deposit Account. An equivalent amount will be converted
into local currency and credited to a Central Treasury account that i s used to finance budget
expenditures.

261.     Through the Ministry of Finance, the Government will report to IDA the amount received into
the US Dollar Deposit Account at the Bank of Laos, and the amounts withdrawn from the Deposit
Account and the equivalent amounts credited in local currency to the Central Treasury Account
available to finance budgeted expenditures. The report on the amounts withdrawn will include the
date and namelnumber of the government's bank account into which the local currency amounts have
been deposited. The report on receipts and disbursements from the Deposit accounts i s to be
submitted to IDA within 45 days of the final disbursement of the grant proceeds from the Deposit
Account.

262.     The Government will ensure that the grant proceeds are used for budgeted public
expenditures except for purposes or items on IDA'S"negative list" as agreed during negotiations and
specified in the Financing Agreement. If the proceeds of the Grant or any part of the Grant proceeds
are used for ineligible purposes, as defined in the Financing Agreement, the Bank will require the
Government, upon notification from IDA, to refundthe amount directly to IDA. Amounts refundedto
IDA upon such requests shall be cancelled. Upon request by IDA, the dedicated account and related
fund flows to and from this account will be audited by independent auditors acceptable to IDA and in
accordance with terms of reference acceptable to IDA, and the audit report will be provided to IDA
within four months after IDA'Srequest for such an audit. The processes and controls described above
reflect the findings of the IMF's safeguard assessment as regards the central bank control environment
in making use of a dedicated deposit account for the foreign exchange proceeds of the Bank`s
disbursement.

ENVIRONMENTALASPECTS
263.     The proposed PRS02 supports a wide range of policy areas and interventions. Overall, the
environmentalimpacts are not expected to be significant. Nevertheless, certain environmental impacts
are likely-positive  insome areas and potentially negative inothers.

264.     With support from the PRSO program, Government has made progress towards sustainable
development in several areas. The Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry (MAF) completed
requirements for independent certification of sustainable forest management inpilot villages. A forest
sector monitoring system was established. The Action Plan for the Financial Sustainability of the
Power Sector was adopted by the MIH,MOF, and EDL.At the same time, in the context of NT2, the
Government has enacted the National Policy on Environmental and Social Sustainability of the
Hydropower Sector to ensure that future development of the hydropower projects complies with
environment and social safeguards. The PRSO program i s also supported by work under the 2005/6
Public Expenditure Review, which will have a chapter devoted to environmental issues; the Lao
Environmental and Social (LENS) project; NT2 environmental, economic and social work; the
Poverty and Environment Nexus study series; and the forthcoming Lao Environment Monitor 2005.
The latter finds that the Government's capacity to implement environmental policies and regulations
needs significant improvement.

                                                  55

265.      Some PRSO supported actions have environmental aspects which require ongoing attention.
SOE restructuring, particularly in industries where there i s a potential for significant environmental
liabilities, should be backed by environmental analysis of existing liabilities. Trade liberalization
should also be scrutinized for any implications on environment and natural resources, given the
country's highdependence on its natural resource base. PRSO2 will continue to support major policy
and institutional reform in natural resources management especially forest management. Despite the
efforts of the government to properly manage the recently established system of National Production
Forest Area (NPFA), ongoing attention i s needed to lower the risk of illegal logging, encroachment,
and agricultural land conversion. The revenue sharing scheme must be transparent and equitable to
benefit the local communities whose livelihood primarily depends on the forest resources. To further
support forest management, resources are available from the Sustainable Forestry and Rural
Development Project.

266.      Regarding infrastructure, the PRSO program will provide further support to EDL to
implement the Action Plan for the Financial Sustainability of the Power Sector. Since the major
source of power comes from hydropower with potentially high environment and social impacts, the
government i s working toward ensuring compliance with environmental and social safeguards.
Support from international partners is available through the NT2 Hydroelectric, NT Social and
Environment, and Lao Environment and Social projects. The expected improvements in the fuel levy
and utility tariffs, and laws regulating them, will also be analyzed in view of the poverty and
environmental linkages.

RISKSAND RISKMITIGATION
267.      Overall, the Lao PDR PRSO series remains a high risk program. The potential payoff-Lao
PDR remaining on its current growth and poverty reduction trajectory and making rapid progress
towards Millennium Development Goals-is        substantial enough to justify this risk. However, careful
risk mitigation will be necessary. Five main risks have been identified which could affect the impact
of the proposed operationand PRSOprogram, set out below together with mitigating factors.

268.      Unevencommitmentto reformsinearlier years has resulted inpoor policy implementation
performance.

269.      This risk is mitigated by: (i) apparent commitment to and growing momentum of a broad-
                                      the
based program of reforms in the past few years, under both the Financial Management Adjustment
Credit (FMAC) and PRSO1; (ii) broad participation and policy dialogue through which the
                                     the
NGPES and NSEDP have been formulated and fostered by the PRSO series; and (iii)               the reform
momentum likely to be generated by trade integration, including ASEAN Free Trade Area (AFTA)
commitments and the application for World Trade Organization (WTO) accession.

270.      Weak publicfinancialmanagementsystems indicate highfiduciary risk.These systems are
characterized by poor coordination between planning and budgeting, lack of transparency and weak
central control during budget preparation and execution, all of which undermine efforts to enforce
fiscal discipline and the policy alignment of spending.

271.      This risk is mitigated by:   (i)the tangible progress being made in strengthening public
financial management processes and systems through the Government-prepared Public Expenditure
Management Strengthening Program (detailed further under component 1.1 in Section V above); (ii)
the recruitment of a PEMSP Technical Adviser; (iii)commitment to a clear and transparent
framework to ensure that revenues from the NamTheun 2 (NT2) hydroelectric project are allocated to
poverty reduction, growth and environmental programs in a transparent fashion; and (iv) the
commitment shown by the authorities in conducting field work for the PETS and PER during the
PRS02 period.

                                                  56

272.     Provincial autonomy hinders implementation of national policies and an equitable
distribution of resources. Provinces retain authority over revenue collection and budget execution,
and still report sporadically to the central Government. Further, provincial treasuries often retain
revenues intended for the central administration, resulting in central Treasury cash constraints and
wide variations between provinces inper capita expenditures on priority sectors.

273.     This risk is mitigated by: (i) the explicit commitment in both the PEMSP and the draft
NSEDP 2006-10 to address these issues; (ii)   the dialogue on fiscal decentralization now starting as
part of the Budget Law revision process under the PEMSP; and (iii)  the Government's progress under
PRS02 with implementing a new Financial Management Information System (FMIS) in 14 of the 17
provinces.

274.     Continuing fiscal risks could result in the diversion of PRSO funds away from
NGPESNSEDP priorities and to cover losses of SCBs and SOEs. In particular, SCBs are still
vulnerable to pressuresto extend credits on a non-commercialbasis.

275.     This risk is mitigated by: (i) Government's repeated and explicit commitment to maintain
                                     the
budgetary discipline; (ii)commitment to the PEMSP, including measures to strengthen fiscal
planning, budget execution, monitoring and transparency; and (iii) PRSO-supported actions to reform
SCBs, public utilities and other SOEs, and to ensure international standard external audits for the
largest SCBs and SOEs.

276.     Severe capacity constraints in the civil service, due to the lack of qualified personnel and
low pay and incentives.

277.     This risk is mitigated by: (i) explicit recognition on the part of the Government of these
                                      an
weaknesses in the NGPES and draft NSEDP; (ii)       the TA and capacity building activities financed
through IDA'S Financial Management Capacity Building Credit (FMCBC) and by other donors.

    Mr.PaulD.Wolfowitz
    President
    The World Bank
    Washington, D.C.

    Dear Mr. Wolfowitz,

    On behalf of the Government of Lao PDR, Iam writing to request the International
    Development Association's continued financial and technical support for the
    implementation of our National Growth and Poverty Eradication Strategy through a
     SecondPoverty Reduction Support Operation (PRSO 2).

    Poverty ReductionStratem

    Our intention is to achieve rapid economic growth in order to improve the living
    conditions of the poor population. We are committed to halving poverty by 2015 and
    graduating from the status o f least-developed country by 2020. Our commitment to
    reforms and the development strategy to achieve these goals has been articulated inthe
    fivc-year National Socio-Economic Development Plan for 2001-2005 (NGPES 01-05)
    and the national Growth and Poverty Eradication Strategy (NGPES, the Lao Poverty
    Reduction Strategy Paper), and will be hrther developed in the upcoming five-year
    National Socio-Economic Development Planfor 2006-2010 (NSEDP 06-lo), Which has
    been shared and discussed extensively with your staff and other donors and which will
    be presentedto the NationalAssembly by July 2006.

    The government has made strides in recent years towards more participatory and
    transparent development planning.The NGPES andNSEDP 01-05 were also debeloped
    through extensive consultations at central as well as local
    fkom the LJNDP, the World Bank,ADB and other donors. The

consultations with mass organizations, such as the Lao Women's Union, discussions
were held with the private sector, academics, and the provinces. Consultations with
donor partners were carried out in the context o f the 8* Roundtable meetings in 2003.
To ensure the success and to oversee the process, the NGPES committee was formed,
and drew membership fiom key ministries, agencies, and representatives fiom several
mass organizations. The document was submittedto the National Assembly in October
2003, which approvedit aRer a four-day workshop.

The NGPES establishes a framework for future development (all incorporated, into the
draft NSEDP 06-10) and makes our development priorities more explicit and
transparent. These priorities take into account the multi-dimensional nature of poverty
alleviation, and are detailed inthe concrete actions proposed inthe NGPES matrix. This
strategy, inparticular, seeks to:

i)Maintainmacroeconomic stabilitybyincreasingrevenueandensuringappropriate
    fiscal and monetary policy;
ii)Deepenstructuralreformsinthefollowingarea:publicexpendituremanagement,
    financial sector, SOEs, private sector, trade, public administration, and devdopment

v) Invest in rural development and natural resource management-including          support
    for agricultural, mining, forestry andhydropower development; and
vi) Strengthen capacity.

Second Poverty ReductionSuuuortOueration

A second PRSO will provide selective support to the NGPES and NSEDP 06-10
implementation, buildingon the valuable support provided under PRSO 1.The,ongoing
series of PRSOs is assisting us to make monitorable progress inrealizing the objectives
laid out in the NGPES, and to enhance the sustainability o f our developmedt efforts
through the promotion of economic growth. The policy improvement program
articulated in the PRSOs focuses ina selective fashion on key areas of the NGPES, by
drawing on the conclusions and recommendations of analytical work realized inrecent
years by the Bank incooperation with us andother donors.

PRSO2 underpins our objective to maintain a sound macroeconomic environqhent and
accelerate growth, while providing external resources for the execution of our FY 2006
budget. The PRSOs aim at increasingavailable resources by enhancing the environment
for resource generation, and promoting sustainable growth via a stronger private sector,
greater trade volume, and greater capacity to manage natural resources. The PRSO
program is structured inthree components and nine sub-components, each wit@agreed
policy actions and defined outcomes and indicators (please refer to the revise PRSO
Program Matrix)                                                                  P

      IMF Concludes 2005 Article IV Consultation with the Lao People's
                                     Democratic Republic


On March, 8, 2006, the Executive Board of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) concluded
the Article IV consultation with the Lao People's Democratic Republic.'

Background

The economy performed well during 2005. Economic growth increased to 7 percent, driven
mainly by an expansion in activity at the Oxiana gold and copper mine and the construction of
the Nam Theun 2 (NT2) hydro-electric dam. Higher rice and fuel prices put upward pressure on
inflation in mid 2005, but core inflation remained at around 5-6 percent. With food prices easing,
headline inflation fell back to 8.8 percent in December. The external position held up well,
despite a number of adverse shocks. A surge in mining exports helped to offset the impact of
higher oil prices and lower garment exports. Consequently, external reserves remained broadly
unchanged, at around $230 million or 3 months of imports.

Macroeconomic policies remained on track, but the underlying situation continues to be fragile,
especially in view of Lao P.D.R.'s high external public debt (80 percent of GDP). The
government kept a tight control over the cash budget deficit (3.5 percent of GDP) despite
shortfalls in revenue. However, with debt service and the wage bill continuing to rise, non-wage
spending has come under increasing pressure. The Bank of the Lao P.D.R. maintained

 Under Article IV of the IMF'sArticles of Agreement, the IMF holds bilateral discussions with
members, usually every year. A staff team visits the country, collects economic and financial
information, and discusses with officials the country's economic developments and policies. On
return to headquarters, the staff prepares a report, which forms the basis for discussion by the
Executive Board. At the conclusion of the discussion, the Managing Director, as Chairman of
the Board, summarizes the views of Executive Directors, and this summary is transmitted to the
country's authorities. This PIN summarizes the views of the Executive Board as expressed
during the March, 8, 2006 Executive Board discussion based on the staff report.

monetary stability, through tight control over its net domestic assets, but large directed credits at
the state-owned commercial banks pose a risk to macroeconomic stability.

The economic outlook is favorable, provided progress is made on structural reforms. Growth
should remain strong during the next few years (in the range of 6-7 percent), driven by the
continuing stimulus from NT2 and the large mining projects. The external outlook is also
reasonably buoyant as these projects should generate sizeable net inflows. However the
prospects for sustaining a rapid pace of growth and development depend on actions to address
key structural weaknesses-especially with regard to revenue mobilization, which is critical for
progress towards debt sustainability, and reform of the state-owned commercial banks.
Progress on both fronts continued to be slow in 2005. Further efforts will also be needed to
advance trade reforms and improve the investment climate.

Lao P.D.R.'s PRGF arrangement, approved in April 2001, lapsed in April 2005, with only three
of six reviews completed. Although macroeconomic performance remained broadly on track,
lack of progress on structural reforms and safeguards policies prevented completion of further
reviews. An Ex Post Assessment (EPA) of performance under Lao P.D.R.'s PRGF and ESAF
programs has been completed. The EPA concluded that the design of the programs had been
broadly appropriate, but that slippages with regard to key structural reform objectives suggested
that, in addition to capacity constraints, there had been insufficient government ownership of the
reforms.

Executive Board Assessment

Executive Directors commended the Lao P.D.R. authorities for maintaining stable
macroeconomic conditions and welcomed the robust economic growth and the progress in
reducing poverty. While disciplined economic management has underpinned the improved
performance of the economy in recent years, Directors noted that many challenges remain. The
underlying macroeconomic situation remains fragile, reflecting weaknesses in the fiscal position
and the banking system, as well as the large external debt burden. There is also a need to
improve the trade and investment regime to enhance the competitiveness of the economy, and
expenditure management needs to be strengthened to ensure a more effective use of public
resources for poverty reduction. Directors encouraged the authorities to use the opportunity
provided by the sixth national development plan to move forward in these critical areas.

Lao P.D.R.'s economic outlook is favorable given the sizeable stimulus from major projects in
the mining and hydropower sectors, but Directors stressed that this is not without risk. The
immediate priority is to ensure a sound budget framework for 2005/06, based on realistic
revenue targets and a sustainable expansion in the wage bill. In this context, Directors
welcomed the authorities' commitment to make the expansion in civil service employment
conditional on strengthened revenue mobilization. This would allow for alleviation of the
compression in nonwage spending in priority sectors, while containing the overall deficit to a
 level consistent with available concessional donor financing.

 Directors welcomed the authorities' intention to continue to gear monetary policy toward
 reducing inflation. They agreed that the Bank of the Lao P.D.R.'s net domestic assets should

remain the main anchor of monetary policy, and that firm control of net domestic assets should
be underpinned by prudent fiscal management. Directors noted that rapid credit expansion by
state-owned commercial banks, reflecting large credits to a government-sponsored project,
posed a risk to monetary stability. They welcomed the initial steps to rein in the exposure of
these banks, but emphasized the need to strengthen the regulations on single borrower
exposure and to limit the scope of regulatory forbearance in this area. The authorities should
also move swiftly to find a strategic investor to place the project on a financially viable footing.
Directors considered Lao P.D.R.'sexchange rate system, with intervention focused on
smoothing transitory fluctuations, to be appropriate.

Directors stressed the importance of mobilizing revenue to enable Lao P.D.R. to meet its
substantial expenditure needs within a sustainable fiscal framework. The main priority is to
establish a strong tax and customs administration to raise revenues and support major tax
policy reforms, including the introduction of a VAT. Progress on this front would depend
importantly on reforms to strengthen central control over revenue operations in the provinces.

Directors urged the authorities to advance the Public Expenditure Management Strengthening
Program. While the immediate focus on improving budget monitoring is appropriate, the main
priority is to establish a strong national treasury with effective control over public finances.
Given its decentralized structure, strengthening fiscal management will require a broader review
of center-province relations to clarify the assignment of revenue and expenditure responsibilities
and establish a clear and credible revenue-sharing framework.

Directors noted the government's decision not to avail itself of debt relief under the enhanced
HlPC and Multilateral Debt Relief Initiatives. To lower the country's high external debt, they
encouraged the authorities to maximize grant financing and maintain a high level of
concessionality on new borrowing, in addition to strengthened domestic revenue mobilization.

Directors urged the authorities to expedite the restructuring of the financially weak state-owned
commercial banks. They encouraged the government to seek private participation in the banks
to facilitate their reform and enhance the banking system. In the interim, it will be important to
maintain close oversight of the banks until their restructuring is complete. Directors also
emphasized the importance of improving bank supervision, and urged the authorities to provide
a more level playing field for private banks.

Directors encouraged the authorities to strengthen the trade and investment climate to improve
the economy's competitiveness. They welcomed the authorities' plans to move ahead with the
ASEAN Free Trade Agreement and their initiation of formal negotiations for WTO accession,
and considered these as important steps towards integrating the economy into the regional and
global markets. Directors were encouraged by the approval of a new Enterprise Law, but noted
that more needs to be done to create a transparent and predictable regulatory environment for
investors, and develop an effective legal and judicial system.

Directors welcomed the opportunity to review Lao P.D.R.'s performance under Fund
arrangements since the early 1990s.They agreed that Lao P.D.R. had made significant
progress in reducing poverty and moving towards a market based economy under the ESAF

                                                     - 4 -


and PRGF-supported programs, but noted that many challenges remain. Looking ahead,
Directors considered that, in addition to building capacity, a strong consensus within
government on needed structural reforms, especially in the fiscal and banking areas, will be
important. Evidence of progress on this front should be a precondition for any future Fund-
supported program. In the meantime, Directors were of the view that surveillance, combined
with well-targeted technical assistance, would be the most appropriate form of engagement.

Directors expressed concern that the poor quality of economic statistics is hampering effective
surveillance and urged the authorities to strengthen the balance of payments, the national
accounts, and government financial statistics, especially at the provincial level. They also
encouraged the authorities to address weaknesses in the accounting systems at the Bank of the
Lao P.D.R., which are hindering the effective monitoring of monetary and foreign exchange
developments.
