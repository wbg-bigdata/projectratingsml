F. Results Framework Analysis

Program Development Objectives (from Program Document)
The Economic Recovery Support Operation (ERSO) supports policy actions
implemented between April 2010 and June 2011 aimed at stabilizing the economy,
strengthening governance and safeguarding social protection. These areas are rooted in
the government’s near-term priorities and medium-term vision, and are critical for
improving private sector confidence and reviving the economy. The PDOs include (i)
strengthened governance in the management of public assets and revenues through
maintaining Ministry of Finance's control over all capital spending by abolishing the off-
budget development fund and asserting stronger budget control, enhancing transparency
in the privatization process, establishing proper accounting, improving operational
performance in the energy sector, and maintaining financial sector stability; and (ii)
safeguarding social spending by ensuring essential social protection spending, and re-
establishing livelihoods and providing social compensation for the conflict-affected
population and businesses.

1.      Program Context, Development Objectives and Design

1.1     Context at Appraisal

Before the 2010 Political and Economic Crisis

1.      During the early and mid-2000s, the Kyrgyz Republic continued market-
based reforms and achieved relative macroeconomic stability. These efforts built
upon on structural reforms the authorities began in the 1990s, following independence
from the Soviet Union in 1991. 1 These reforms, along with prudent monetary policy
helped keep inflation in check. After declining sharply in the 1990s, annual average GDP
growth rebounded to 5.7 percent during 2003-2008. The structure of the economy
evolved with the transition from a planned to a market-oriented economy, with the share
of services rising from the low twenties to half of output by 2012. The share of
agriculture declined from almost 40 percent of GDP at the start of transition to about 20
percent in 2011. A surge in gold mining has helped keep the share of industry at about
30 percent despite a decline in manufacturing. 2

2.      During the global economic and financial crisis, growth slowed from 7.6
percent in 2008 to 2.9 percent in 2009. Faced with a decline in foreign direct
investment (FDI), external demand and workers’ remittances, the authorities
implemented a large fiscal stimulus and appropriately loosened monetary policy. In
addition to a reduction in the valued-added tax (VAT) rate from 20 percent to 12 percent
in 2009, public spending rose sharply from 29 percent of GDP in 2008 to 36 percent in
2009, driven primarily by larger expenditures on pensions and public sector wages.
Consequently, the budget shifted from a small surplus in 2008 to a deficit equivalent to
3.5 percent of GDP in 2009.

3.      Strong economic growth and rapidly increasing remittances contributed to
poverty reduction in the mid-2000s. Overall poverty fell from 40 percent in 2006 to 32
percent in 2009, and extreme poverty from 9 percent to 3 percent during the same
period. 3 Although rural poverty remains much higher than urban poverty—37 percent
compared to 22 percent in 2009—the rate of decline in rural poverty was faster and now
equals that in urban areas. With a GNI per capita of $880 in 2010, the Kyrgyz Republic
remains one of the two poorest countries in Europe and Central Asia.

4.    Despite macroeconomic stability through much of the 2000s, there was little
progress with structural reforms involving transparency and good governance.
While reforms to foster openness met with some success, good governance and

  Kyrgyzstan’s poverty line, defined by the National Statistics Committee, is based on a basic needs
approach that estimates the costs of a consumption basket, excluding rent.

Competitiveness Index consistently highlights corruption and weak governance as key
factors limiting investment. The country is also ranked near the bottom of Transparency
International’s Corruption Perception Index. During the three years prior to April 2010,
the President put in place measures to concentrate power within his own administrative
apparatus. This removal of checks and balances further weakened transparency and
accountability and increased the public’s mistrust of government.

2010 Political and Economic Crisis

5.      In April 2010, anti-government demonstrations culminated in the removal of
the president and the formation of a provisional administration. These
demonstrations were fuelled by several factors, including the above-mentioned
centralization of power within the presidency, a lack of voice in economic decision-
making, corruption, nepotism, and the misuse of public assets, especially in energy and
telecommunications. These events left a power vacuum in the south of the country and, in
June 2010, rising political and social tensions exploded into three days of social unrest,
especially in Jalalabad and Osh. According to official data, the fighting resulted in more
than 300 deaths, 2,500 injured individuals, large numbers of internally displaced persons,
and extensive destruction of public infrastructure and private property. A Joint Economic
Assessment (JEA) by the Bank and other development partners estimated the cost of
infrastructure damage at about $350 million, or over 7 percent of GDP. 4

6.     The provisional administration drafted a new constitution that shifted the
balance of executive power from the presidency to the prime minister, chosen by
and responsible to the legislature. Under the new constitution, parliamentary elections
were held in October 2010. A four-party coalition, committed to macroeconomic stability
and continued market-oriented reforms, took office in December 2010. Subsequently, a
presidential election took place in October 2011 with the new president sworn in on
December 1, 2011. In August 2012, the coalition collapsed but was promptly replaced in
early September by a new three-party coalition. The new government has confirmed its
commitment to the policy reforms initiated by the previous government.

7.      The Kyrgyz Republic’s fragile and potentially volatile political environment
impacts the effective functioning of both the public and private sectors. Poor
financial management continues to limit both the efficiency and impact of public
spending. Weak governance and nepotism undermine the credibility of institutional
reforms designed to promote open, competitive recruitment and merit-based career
development in the civil service. 5 Furthermore, corruption deters private sector

involvement in the formal economy, evidenced by the scope and size of the shadow
economy, currently estimated as high as 40-60% of GDP. 6

Economic, Social, and Poverty Impact

8.      The political turmoil and ethnic conflict inflicted a huge shock on the
economy, resulting in recession. Economic activity was disrupted, particularly in the
south; the financial sector became severely stressed; and services and trade were badly
affected by a lack of security and the closure of the country’s borders with Kazakhstan
and Uzbekistan. Consequently, the economy contracted by 0.5 percent in 2010. The
current account moved from a surplus of 0.7 percent of GDP in 2009 to a deficit of 6.4
percent in 2010, as exports shrank and remittances declined.

9.      To mitigate the impact of the crisis and to ease social and ethnic tensions, the
authorities boosted government spending. However, due to absorptive capacity
constraints, crisis-related spending in the south was only 1.7 percent of GDP rather than
the 4.5 percent originally projected. 7 Unrelated to the crisis, social fund expenditures rose
by about 2.4 percent of GDP as a result of pension increases previously enacted to offset
the rise in utility tariffs. Although the budget deficit increased from 3.5 percent of GDP
in 2009 to 6.3 percent in 2010, it was just over half the 12 percent projected in the 2010
post-crisis JEA. This was due to higher than expected revenues and output, and lower
than planned capital spending.

10.      Prompt action by the National Bank of the Kyrgyz Republic (NBKR), the
central bank, to address the failure of the country’s largest bank, helped prevent
contagion. Seven banks faced serious problems and were placed under central bank
administration. The country’s largest and systemically most important bank, Asia
Universal Bank (AUB), was nationalized, declared bankrupt, and subsequently split into
a good bank (Zalkar) and a bad bank (AUB), with the former to be privatized and the
latter liquidated. Following these interventions, the banking system stabilized, though
non-performing loans had almost doubled to 15.8 percent by end-2010. Although banks
stopped lending in the south, overall credit to the private sector at KGS 26 billion or
about 13 percent of GDP was broadly unchanged.

11.     These fiscal and financial sector measures helped sustain economic activity
and promote employment. Outlays on repairs and rehabilitation of essential
infrastructure and the economy’s capital stock strengthened the supply base and, in
particular, improved the reliability of energy supply, vital to growth and social stability.
Increased public spending on reconstruction in the south helped restore disrupted
livelihoods. Financial sector reforms helped boost confidence in the banking system,
enabling enterprises to borrow.

 Relatively well-targeted non-categorical social benefits have remained steady at around 0.7 percent of
GDP, which is low and also has low coverage.

12.     Nonetheless, the political and economic crisis had a serious impact on
society. The conflict in the south created tensions that left a residue of bewilderment and
fear. While refugees and the internally displaced returned home, efforts were still needed
to complete the repair and reconstruction of housing, resume the delivery of social
services, and restore livelihoods.

13.    After years of steady decline, poverty increased to 34 percent in 2010 and 37
percent in 2011. The closure of the borders with Kazakhstan and Uzbekistan, along with
other restrictions, affected cross-border trade and thus the livelihoods of poor
communities living in these areas. Farming was disrupted by the delayed supply of
traded inputs and the lack of credit in the south. Two labor-intensive industries,
construction and tourism, bore the brunt of the disruption and violence: by mid-2010,
tourism in the important but poor region of Issyk-Kul had virtually dried up, with major
income and jobs losses. On the other hand, the reversal of energy price rises in April
2010 and the retention of increases in public sector wages, pensions, social allowances,
and targeted cash transfers enacted earlier in 2010, helped mitigate some of these effects,
especially for the urban poor. The impact on the rural poor was more muted.

1.2    Original Program Development Objectives (PDO) and Key Indicators (as
       approved)

14.     The Economic Recovery Support Operation (ERSO) supported the Kyrgyz
Republic’s post-conflict recovery and transition to medium-term growth and
poverty reduction. Having met the immediate challenges of reconstruction and the
restoration of security, the authorities addressed post-conflict recovery, growth, and
poverty alleviation by combining limited fiscal expansion with reforms designed to
strengthen governance and safeguard social protection. Supporting the budget and the
implementation of reforms undertaken or underway during April 2010-June 2011, the
operation was aimed at providing a bridge to new policy measures under the
government’s planned Medium-Term Development Program for 2012-14.

15.    The program’s key development objectives were organized under two
themes. The first was to strengthen governance in the management of public assets and
resources, including specific steps towards greater transparency and public
accountability—key failures of the previous government. The second was to safeguard
social protection and provide temporary social assistance to the conflict-affected
population.

16.     The program’s effectiveness and impact were measured by five high level
outcomes. These were: (a) Ministry of Finance (MOF) control over all capital spending;
(b) energy sector finances managed more transparently; (c) financial sector stability
maintained by ensuring that the central bank is better equipped to monitor banks and
address vulnerabilities quickly; (d) social protection spending is safeguarded; and (e)
targeted support provided to the poor and conflict-affected population. In addition, the
policy matrix included 15 specific indicators by which expected outcomes were to be
measured.

development objectives nor its key outcome indicators were revised.

1.4        Original Policy Areas Supported by the Program (as approved)

Theme 1: Strengthened Governance in Management of Public Assets and Revenues

Budget Control and Transparency

18.     The ERSO supported the government’s central objective of imposing
discipline on the management and use of public assets and revenues. This was to be
achieved by: completing liquidation of the extra-budgetary Development Fund decreed
by the interim government on April 30, 2010; developing improved asset management
norms and practices in the State Property Management Fund (responsible for
privatization and management of state assets); 8 and continued implementation of the
country’s commitments under the Extractive Industries Transparency Initiative (EITI).

Energy Sector Transparency and Accounting

19.     The ERSO supported implementation of the Energy Sector Transparency
Initiative (ESTI), adopted in July 2010. This included: establishment of a Supervisory
Council in the Ministry of Energy, including adoption of internal regulations for its
governance; creation of transparent, rules-based mechanisms for managing and
monitoring financial flows, especially electricity export proceeds in escrow accounts; and
enactment of performance agreements between the Energy Regulatory Authority and
energy companies.

Financial Sector Stability

20.     The ERSO supported NBKR’s restructuring of the financially-distressed,
Asia Universal Bank (AUB) into a new entity, Zalkar Bank. It also provided for the
introduction of direct supervision and temporary administration procedures for
rehabilitation of financially distressed banks, the development of supervisory response
mechanisms to identify and initiate prompt preventive and corrective action, and the
restructuring of the Deposit Protection Agency (DPA) as an independent legal entity.

Theme 2: Safeguarding Social Protection & Supporting Conflict-affected Population

Safeguarding Social Protection

21.    The ERSO supported the government’s objective of maintaining the value in real
terms of unified monthly benefits for low income families with children, by increasing

the guaranteed minimum income (GMI), and by monetizing in-kind social benefits as
direct cash payments. In addition, the number of rights-based categories was reduced
from 39 to 25.

Supporting Conflict-affected Population

22.    The ERSO supported implementation of the government’s decision to introduce
additional monthly social benefits for families affected by the national crisis of 2010.

1.5     Revised Policy Areas

23.     The policy areas were not revised.

1.6     Other Significant Changes

24.    There were no significant changes in design, scope and scale, implementation
arrangements, or funding.

2.2      Major Factors Affecting Implementation

26.     One principal factor affecting preparation and initial implementation of the
ERSO reform program was the country’s fragile economic and political situation
during the second half of 2010 and 2011. The political turmoil and ethnic conflict of
April-June 2010 inflicted a huge shock on the economy and society, resulting in recession.
Second, the new government’s overall capacity was low and its decision-making
fragmented. Third, implementing the shift in the balance of power from the presidency to
the prime minister under the new constitution and adjusting to the requirements of an
emerging parliamentary democracy was and remains work in progress. Indeed, in August
2012, the four-party coalition broke down, and was replaced soon after with a new three-
party coalition. These events underscore the fragile political environment in the country
and the difficulty government faces in maintaining momentum for structural reforms.
Moreover, the public’s distrust in government remains high, suggesting reforms towards
anti-corruption will need to stay firmly on the government’s agenda. 9

27.   Notwithstanding these uncertainties, both the government’s commitment to,
and ownership of, the program was high. This is evidenced by the fact that the four
most important governance-related policy actions—liquidation of the extra-budgetary
Development Fund, enactment of improved privatization and state property management


9
  The International Republican Institute’s (IRI) latest survey shows that corruption remains in the top three
issues facing the country.

                                                      7
policies and processes, adoption of the Energy Sector Transparency Initiative (ESTI), and
re-structuring of the country’s largest bank—were well advanced early in the ERSO
preparation process. Indeed, these four measures were essential components of the
provisional government’s immediate policy response to the excesses of the old régime on
which its own initial credibility partly depended. The government’s Letter of
Development Policy recorded their commitment to these reforms and medium-term
outcomes.

28.     The program’s explicit alignment with government priorities facilitated both
its design and implementation. The ERSO agenda was aligned with the authorities’
short-term economic and social stabilization priorities. It supported the government’s
emphasis on ensuring fiscal sustainability with reforms to strengthen governance and
safeguard social protection. It also supported the central bank’s management and
resolution of the banking crisis. This coherence of program content and government
strategy facilitated implementation. Most of the substantive policy measures had been
completed before the ERSO’s consideration by the Bank’s Executive Directors in August
2011.

29.     Effective dialogue with the authorities immediately following the crisis also
facilitated program design and implementation. Despite the Bank’s relations with the
previous government, which in light of the events of April 2010 could have affected its
standing with the new administration, its dialogue and leadership ensured credibility was
maintained. The new government confirmed this by stating that it saw the Bank as
playing a key role as adviser and financier of the country’s post-conflict recovery, as well
as its long-term investment needs. Together with the Asian Development Bank (ADB)
and the International Monetary Fund (IMF), the Bank’s leadership also helped coordinate
the international response to the economic and humanitarian crisis. All three institutions
were integral in the preparation of the JEA, and in convening the July 2010 multi-
development partner conference, where $1.1 billion was pledged (including funding for
the balance of the 2010 budget). Finally, the concurrent preparation, processing, and
presentation of the FY12-13 Interim Strategy Note (ISN) intensified and reinforced the
quality of the dialogue and, indirectly, the program's design and implementation.

2.3    Expected Next Phase/Follow-up Operation:

30.     While the ERSO was designed and justified as a single tranche operation, the
program document presaged, though did not commit to, a follow-up series of
programmatic development policy operations (DPOs). This would be subject, inter
alia, to the authorities’ continued commitment to governance-related structural reforms
and to maintenance of satisfactory fiscal and macroeconomic policies. This was deemed
appropriate given the complexity, long-term nature, and political economy of the reforms
being supported. It would also help ensure sustainability of the measures already in place
and advance and reinforce the reform process further. A DPO series supporting
governance reforms initiated in the ERSO and reforms targeted towards improving the
business environment is currently under preparation.

3.      Assessment of Outcomes

3.1     Relevance of Objectives, Design and Implementation

31.     The ERSO’s objectives and design were highly relevant to the needs and
priorities of the Kyrgyz government. Together with funding for the 2011 budget
committed by the ADB ($40.6 million), the IMF ($29.7 million), and the European Union
(€12 million), the ERSO provided resources to ensure that essential spending, especially
in the social sphere, was protected and to support economic stabilization in the medium-
term. It was aligned with the government’s strategy of countervailing the major stress
factors that caused the 2010 crisis, while also building institutional capacity for
strengthened governance and improved public resource management. Its policy
framework provided support for short-term priorities, such as liquidating the
Development Fund, restructuring the country’s largest, systemically important bank,
(AUB), and introducing social benefits for conflict-affected families. Policies requiring a
longer-term perspective and timetable, such as public finance and financial sector
reforms, as well as the broader governance and transparency agendas, were also included
in the framework. The decision to proceed with a single tranche operation reflected a
desire to offer timely support for the agreed priorities of a newly elected, not yet fully
secure government. At the same time, a single tranche operation did not commit to a
series of programmatic development policy operations in what was still an uncertain and
high risk environment, and where there was not sufficient certainty on the government's
medium-term policy orientation.

32.      The ERSO’s focus on governance and social protection was aligned with the
Bank’s FY12-13 ISN. Indeed, the two themes of the ERSO’s policy framework are
effectively the same as the ISN’s pillars, namely: improved governance and social
stability, and economic stabilization. Both the ERSO and the ISN represented the
culmination of a very intensive 15-month effort by development partners, led by the
Bank, to provide timely, well-coordinated support to the country at a defining moment.
This support included the production of the JEA in less than three months; the
organization of a multi-development partner conference; and, from the Bank itself, a $70
million Emergency Recovery Project and additional financing totaling $66 million for
four ongoing investment projects. 10 Finally, the ERSO and related ISN employed an
approach that drew upon the analysis and recommendations of the Bank’s 2011 World
Development Report on conflict and development—specifically a conflict analysis and
‘filter’ of destabilizing drivers, patterns, and trends, which was undertaken between mid-
2011 and 2012. It was also consistent with the cross-cutting governance theme and social
sector reform pillar of ECA’s regional strategy for Europe and Central Asia.

3.2        Achievement of Program Development Objectives

33.     The Implementation Completion Report (ICR) rates the achievement of
program development objectives—measured by its five key outcome indicators and
related targets—as successful. It should be noted that the four most important
governance-related measures were well advanced, even substantially completed very
early in the preparation process, making it difficult to make causal linkages between
ERSO supported policy actions and outcomes. The successful rating takes into account
two broader considerations. First, these reforms are still in place and several - especially
those in the energy sector, and public finance management - are being advanced in the
upcoming DPO series, as well as in ongoing lending and technical assistance activities.
Second, the reforms are being undertaken in a still fragile institutional and political
environment, characterized by a strong commitment to, but with limited practical
experience of, representative government.

Recent Macroeconomic and Fiscal Trends

34.     The economy rebounded quickly in 2011, but a sharp drop in gold output has
led to a 0.9 percent contraction in the economy in 2012. 11 With physical security and
political stability largely restored, the economy grew by 5.7 percent in 2011. Industry,
especially gold mining and hydropower, was the main driver, with agriculture, services,
and trade also contributing. By contrast, lower production at the Kumtor gold mine
during most of 2012, and lower than expected growth in the agriculture sector, have
brought down 2012 GDP growth. Conversely, other sectors in the economy performed
better than expected, preventing end of year growth from dropping further. Looking
ahead to the medium-term, growth is projected to average 5 percent annually, driven
mainly by a rebound in gold mining but also by agriculture, hydropower, and textiles.
This relatively favourable outlook also assumes the government’s continued commitment
to structural reforms, especially those related to combating corruption, improving
governance, and facilitating financial and private sector development.

35.     With public spending surging by almost 10 percentage points of GDP from
2008-12, fiscal consolidation is urgently needed. In 2012, the preliminary figure for the
fiscal deficit is 6.1 percent of GDP, the highest currently estimated in Europe and Central
Asia. The rise in capital spending is explained by several large energy infrastructure
investments; and the growth in current expenditures by recent increases in public wages
and pensions. The latter, estimated to have exceeded 24 percent of GDP in 2012, may be
difficult to contain or reverse in the foreseeable future. Thus, fiscal consolidation
originally scheduled for 2012, but made more difficult by the drop in gold output, will
continue to be challenge for 2013. Alongside the Bank’s Public Expenditure Review, the
IMF is supporting the government’s efforts towards medium term fiscal consolidation, in
addition to providing resources for budget support under the extended credit facility

Theme 1: Strengthening governance in management of public assets and revenues

Budget Control and Transparency

36.     Development Fund. Under the erstwhile Central Agency for Development,
Investment, and Innovation, headed by the former president’s son, a Development Fund
(DF) had been set up to receive and allocate external finance to investment projects
outside the budgetary process. Its liquid balances were invested in instruments of
doubtful quality and in an opaque manner. By end-April 2010, less than a month after the
former president’s removal, the interim government placed the DF under liquidation and
transferred its balances to a special account in the NBKR. The central bank subsequently
made arrangements for an external audit that has since been completed and published.
The government has restored accountability and responsibility for public investments to
the MOF, where all capital spending is now part of the budget and subject to
parliamentary approval. 13 The government is also committed to eschew extra-budgetary
funds. Evidence that these arrangements are in place and effective includes the following:
the MOF publishes all approved and revised budget laws, the medium-term budget
framework, and monthly and annual budget execution reports on its website; the treasury
likewise publishes detailed budget execution reports and other public financial statements
on its website; and the newly empowered parliament conducts budget hearings, with
budget committees that involve civil society organizations, professional associations, the
media, and independent experts. Furthermore, all external grants and loans to the Kyrgyz
Republic, including those by IDA, are now subject to parliamentary approval at both the
signature and ratification stages. This provides further positive proof of the country’s
progress towards improved governance and transparency in the management of public
revenues.

37.    Privatization and State Property Management. In mid-2010, the interim
government reversed three privatizations undertaken at end-2009 and early-2010 under
the previous government: two electricity distribution companies and the country’s largest
telecommunications company. These transactions had been conducted improperly,
including an undervaluation of assets. Against this background, and with the ERSO’s
support, the government issued two resolutions during the second half of 2010: one that
improved the rules and regulations for conducting privatizations, including provision for
open tenders; and the other that strengthened the role of the new Ministry of State
Property (formerly the State Property Committee) in managing public assets, specifically


13
  This process is currently being supported by technical assistance on public investment management
(PIM) under the World Bank’s Capacity for Economic Management project.

                                                     12
government shares in state-owned enterprises. In January 2012, the Ministry of State
Property was restructured into the State Property Management Fund, and made
responsible for the implementation of the medium term privatization program. The
Ministry of Economy is now responsible for the policy making functions related to
privatization, and the preparation of privatization programs for review and approval by
parliament. The 2012-14 privatization program was approved in April 2012.

38.      Extractive Industries Transparency Initiative (EITI). At the 5th EITI Global
Conference in Paris in March 2011, the Kyrgyz Republic was declared fully compliant
with the EITI’s global standards for improved transparency in oil, gas and mining—one
of only 11 countries to achieve this status to date. Whereas only six companies were
reporting at the outset, the number increased to 26 in 2008, 46 in 2011, and 57 in 2012,
the latter now covering almost 95 percent of total extractive industries’ revenues. The
number of government agencies involved has also risen to 35. Since the country’s
accession to the EITI in June 2004, its secretariat (KEITI) in Bishkek has published six
annual reports, the last two including company and government data reconciled by an
independent auditor. The most recent annual report available for the year 2009 was
approved by KEITI’s Supervisory Board and published in May 2011. According to the
KEITI Secretariat, data reconciliation by an external auditor is currently underway for
2010 and 2011. The annual reports for these two years are expected to be ready for
approval and publication by end-2012. This delay, reportedly due to financial constraints
(i.e. the estimated $40,000 cost of data reconciliation by an independent auditor), is a
potential concern, as is the end of the KEITI secretariat’s $265,000 EITI Multi-Donor
Trust Fund (MDTF) grant next June. Unless either government, or other sources of
funding, become available during the next six months, the secretariat could be forced to
suspend or terminate its activities in mid-2013. This would clearly be unfortunate and
raise questions about the EITI’s sustainability in the Kyrgyz Republic. Meanwhile, the
country has reportedly been selected as a pilot for the EITI/MDTF Civil Society
Organizations’ (CSO) Support Program designed to increase the diversity and broaden
the scope of CSOs involved in the EITI process.

Energy Sector Transparency and Accounting

39.     Energy Sector Transparency Initiative (ESTI). The interim government’s
wish to extend EITI principles of transparency and public monitoring to other sectors of
the economy led to the adoption of the ESTI by presidential decree in July 2010. Since
then, the ERSO supported the creation of a Supervisory Council (SC) in the Ministry of
Energy, comprising 12-16 members, half representatives of civil society and half of the
power companies. 14 Its main role is oversight, in particular to review actions planned by
the energy companies, such as tariff changes, exports, new investments, etc. and thus to
raise standards of disclosure and transparency. Second, the government established
special escrow accounts at the power generating and transmission companies where all
export receipts are now deposited. These funds are then allocated for specific purposes,
such as the purchase of fuel for winter heating and power generation. Their use is


14
     Supervisory Councils have been established in over 40 government ministries and agencies.

                                                     13
monitored by SC representatives on the basis of rules and procedures established through
the Ministry of Energy (MOE). Third, the authorities introduced annual performance
agreements between the state regulator and energy companies, a first attempt to make
power company managers publicly accountable on the basis of agreed indicators and
targets.

40.     MOE and SC civil society representatives report modest steps forward
during the past 18-24 months in terms of improved data availability, greater public
participation in decision-making, and growing, if still limited, public accountability.
The initial targets set for increasing collections and reducing losses in 2011 were both
met and, in the case of losses, exceeded. However, neither the ESTI mandate nor the
SC’s composition is designed to address the energy sector’s principal challenges, e.g.
financial viability, export potential, and the still unsatisfactory regulatory framework.
These and other medium and longer-term strategic issues are to be supported in the
upcoming DPO series.

Financial Sector Stability

41.    Restructuring and assisting financially distressed banks. The NBKR took
seven banks under temporary administration, including the financially-distressed Asia
Universal Bank (AUB), the country’s largest bank. The AUB was nationalized, declared
bankrupt, and subsequently split into two—one good bank (Zalkar) and one bad bank
(AUB). Several attempts have been made to privatize Zalkar bank through auction. 15 An
overvalued floor price has been cited as one element that could be deterring investors.
More recently, two potential investors withdrew their interest from the January 2013
auction, mentioning heightened political risk stemming from government threats to
nationalize Kumtor, the country’s main gold mine. AUB, and perhaps now Zalkar, will
be liquidated. Three other small banks remain under conservatorship, with action to
resolve them on hold because of pending court cases by shareholders. Meanwhile,
banking system indicators have begun to improve (cf. Table 3 below). In 2011, for
example the liquidity ratio increased to 74.9 percent, deposits to 13.5 percent of GDP,
and profitability, as measured by return on equity and return on assets, also improved.

42.     The challenges faced by NBKR in resolving problem banks highlighted
deficiencies in the bank resolution legal framework, which prevented it from acting
promptly with banks placed under official administration. It also highlighted
weaknesses in the supervisory framework, including onsite and offsite supervision, stress
testing, and contingency planning and crisis management, especially for large or
‘systemic’ banks. There are also deficiencies in the regulatory framework. For example,
the regulation on credit risk management does not explicitly require banks to adopt
uniform asset classification within the bank or across banks, which can lead to an
understatement of non-performing loans. In addition, there are no regulations on
electronic banking, business continuity planning, outsourcing, new products and related
risks, Basel II, Basel III, consolidated supervision, and risk-based supervision. The
NBKR is drafting a banking code, which is due to be submitted to the Government by
April 2013. 16 Support for some of these legal, regulatory and supervisory issues and the
NBKR’s capacity to monitor and address vulnerabilities is one component of an IDA-
financed financial sector development project approved in 2012, which was also designed
to address the framework for microfinance institutions and credit unions. However, this
project has not been approved by the parliament. The Bank and the authorities are
working together to restructure the project.

43.    The ERSO supported a government resolution that reconstituted the Deposit
Protection Agency (DPA) as an independent legal entity with a supervisory board.
This helped clarify the roles, responsibilities, and accountability of the DPA itself, as well
as the central bank and the government, and was thus an important step towards
improved governance. However, the authorities should strengthen and improve the law
on deposit protection and internal procedures on readiness for efficient performance of its
functions.

Theme 2: Safeguarding social protection, supporting conflict-affected population

Safeguarding Social Protection and Supporting Conflict-affected Population

44.     The ERSO supported the authorities’ measures to prevent the erosion of
already meager unified monthly benefits in the face of rising inflation. Given the
relationship between the guaranteed monthly income (GMI) and unified monthly
benefits, the authorities raised the former by 10 percent in mid-2010 and by 19 percent in
mid-2011. They also took action to reduce the number of poorly targeted categorical
benefits, from 39 to 25, which are non-renewable and are expected to expire in several
years. In addition, the major categorical benefits were monetized as direct payments in
cash.

45.     In the immediate post-conflict period, the government provided significant
support to affected people in the form of cash compensation, and support to re-
establish livelihoods, re-start private businesses, and stimulate investment and
trade. The provisional government adopted a decree in August 2010 that established

     The banking code is being prepared with support from the IMF.

                                                     15
additional monthly social benefits to affected groups, e.g. children and parents of the
dead, those disabled as a result of the violence, and a lump-sum payment to children of
missing citizens. 17 Affected businesses were granted tax exemptions on profits, sales,
immovable property, and land. To further stimulate employment, businesses in the south
were allowed to reduce their social fund contributions. The re-establishment of essential
infrastructure and utility services such as electric power and public transport in Jalalabad
and Osh also helped to raise output.

46.     While the Kyrgyz Republic spends over 5 percent of GDP on social
protection, including 2 percent on social assistance, the latter favors non-targeted
programs. By contrast, coverage of the monthly benefit for poor families—the only
social assistance program targeted to the poorest—has actually fallen since 2007. Thus,
despite the decrease in the number of categorical benefits supported by the ESRO, the
social safety net plays a limited role in protecting the poor. The main priority going
forward is to consolidate and further reduce the number of categorical benefits and shift
social assistance spending decisively towards poverty-targeted programs. Besides re-
allocating financial resources, this will also require improved benefits administration,
oversight and control, as well as outreach efforts to improve coverage—both objectives
of two ongoing IDA-supported technical assistance activities.

  The ERSO supported the government’s efforts to mobilize resources for a one time assistance package
for conflict-affected groups. However, social assistance for these groups has been kept in the 2012 budget,
pushing up expenditures and counteracting efforts towards fiscal consolidation.

3.4    Justification of Overall Outcome Rating

Rating: Satisfactory

47.     All short-term program development outcomes were achieved and most
medium-term policies and outcomes are on track. All fifteen targets for expected
outcomes in the matrix of policy actions have been either met in full or, where these were
qualitative in nature (for example reforms that strengthen the NBKR’s supervisory role),
are ongoing. With ERSO and other development partner support, the Kyrgyz economy
rebounded quickly from the shock of the crisis and its medium-term growth prospects are
favorable. This outlook is, however, dependent on gold output and prices, the flow of
remittances, and in particular the authorities’ continued commitment to structural
reforms. While the focus during the last eighteen months has been on governance and the
management of public assets and resources, there is also a need for structural reforms
designed to enable other areas of the economy to grow.

48.      The Kyrgyz financial system has recovered from the political upheavals of
2010, thanks mainly to prompt action by the NBKR to restore stability. By
restructuring AUB into two new entities, Zalkar Bank and AUB, NBKR helped restore
stability and confidence in the banking system. Furthermore, by introducing direct
supervision and temporary administration procedures for the rehabilitation of six other
financially distressed banks, it prevented contagion. By initiating action plans and bank-
specific supervision strategies to strengthen problem banks, the NBKR helped restore
financial health in some banks while initiating resolution of others. Now that bank
supervisory response mechanisms for identifying critical shortcomings in banks have
been adopted, NBKR is better equipped to supervise the banking system, address
vulnerabilities in a timely manner, and resolve troubled banks efficiently.

3.5    Overarching Themes, Other Outcomes and Impacts

(a)    Poverty Impacts, Gender Aspects, and Social Development

49.     The ERSO program’s emphasis on improved governance was intended to
have a positive social impact, while its focus on safeguarding social protection and
supporting the conflict-affected population was designed to help reduce poverty.
Beneficiary surveys and/or stakeholder workshops were not part of this ICR process. It is
difficult therefore, and probably premature, to try to judge whether, and to what extent
these intended social and poverty impacts are likely to materialize. However, anecdotal
evidence collected from civil society representatives during preparation of this ICR—as
well as the still popular support for the government’s 2012-14 medium-term development
program in which governance and anti-corruption remain one of its three pillars—suggest
that the initial social impact is positive.. As for poverty, the impact of the three policy
measures designed to safeguard social protection in general and to support conflict-
affected people in particular remains to be determined. In this context, according to
official data, not only did overall poverty increase to 34 percent at the peak of the crisis in
2010 but also to 37 percent in 2011, which may be either a delayed effect or due to other

                                              18
factors unrelated to the crisis. Given its importance, especially in the politically aware
Kyrgyz environment, this issue may require additional, more detailed follow up analysis
or investigation than was possible in the context of this ICR.

(b)    Institutional Change/Strengthening

50.    Support for strengthening governance in the management of public assets and
resources contributed to the following achievements:

       •   The MOF controls all capital expenditures and annual budgets are submitted
           to parliament on a consolidated basis.
       •   The new State Property Management Fund has adopted improved, more
           transparent privatization policies and practices, including a privatization
           program that is subject to parliamentary approval. Similar improved norms
           and practices on state property are improving the management of state-owned
           enterprises.
       •   Supervisory Councils, designed to enhance transparency and improve public
           accountability, have been established not only in the Ministry of Energy—one
           focus of the ERSO—but also in over 40 government agencies and ministries.
       •   New rules and regulations have strengthened the central bank’s ability to: (a)
           directly supervise, temporarily administer, and rehabilitate financially
           distressed banks; and (b) anticipate and initiate preventive and corrective
           actions vis-à-vis financially distressed banks.
       •   The Deposit Protection Agency (DPA), formerly a department of the MOF, is
           now an independent legal entity.

4.     Assessment of Risk to Development Outcome

Rating: Substantial

51.     Small, open, landlocked, and overly reliant on gold and remittances, the
Kyrgyz economy is especially vulnerable to macroeconomic shocks. Besides the
external risks noted in the program document, fiscal consolidation while at the same time
safeguarding social spending may become a growing challenge going forward. Banking
system risks have diminished, but NBKR’s capacity and the legal framework for bank
regulation and supervision need strengthening.

52.     The two main internal risks to development outcomes remain political and
institutional. While the political risks outlined in the ERSO program document—the
viability of the constitution, a poorly managed political transition, and power sharing
following the presidential election—have not materialized, the country’s transition to
more open, rules-based representative government remains a work in progress and
subject to periodic instability. On the other hand, the main ERSO-supported measures to
strengthen governance remain in place and their implementation will continue to be a
focus of several ongoing and upcoming operations. They are also central to the Bank’s

                                           19
dialogue with the authorities and are likely to feature prominently in the next Country
Assistance Strategy (CAS).

53.     Human and institutional capacity, however, remains a concern, partly the
result of political changes as well as rapid staff turnover. The government’s ability to
coordinate across key economic and social sectors and its capacity for program
implementation remains weak—despite the fact that human capital development has been
a major feature of development partner support for many years. This is a particular risk
for cross-sectoral areas such as governance.

5.     Assessment of Bank and Borrower Performance

5.1    Bank Performance

(a)    Bank Performance in Ensuring Quality at Entry

Rating: Satisfactory

54.      The ERSO’s preparation was a timely response to the Kyrgyz request for
support following the mid-2010 crisis. The entire process, from Concept Review to
approval by the Executive Directors, took just over six months. Despite this accelerated
process, the operation was thoroughly reviewed within the ECA Region as well as Bank-
wide and the team was able to address reviewers’ concerns satisfactorily. The ERSO
design reflected both the Kyrgyz Republic’s short-term challenges and priorities and its
medium-term vision for restoring private sector confidence and reviving the economy. At
the same time, the operation was selective: it focused on two themes which included a
manageable number of closely related policy measures. Preparation was evidently
facilitated by, and drew upon the JEA completed six months earlier, as well as the
simultaneous preparation and processing of the FY12-13 ISN.

(b)    Quality of Supervision

Rating: Satisfactory

55.    The operation was supervised in the context of continued dialogue on
economic policy and governance. This included a formal ERSO supervision undertaken
in November 2011 at the time of credit and grant effectiveness, as well as supervision of
ongoing technical assistance operations in capacity building for economic management
(CBEM), governance, public finance management, and health and social protection. In
addition, the Bank is currently actively engaged with the authorities on a public
expenditure review and the preparation of the planned FY13 DPO series.

5.2    Borrower Performance

(a)    Government Performance

Rating: Satisfactory


                                           20
56.     The provisional administration moved quickly to prepare an anti-crisis
program which, together with the JEA, was the basis for the hastily convened July
2010 multi-development partner conference. This was followed by an ‘Economy and
Security’ program for 2011 and by end-2011 a three-year medium-term development
strategy, 2012-14. The 10-page Letter of Development Policy not only covered the
government’s response to the crisis, but also outlined its vision for the medium-term and,
in some detail, the key structural reforms envisaged. Since the ERSO preparation did not
formally begin until February 2011, appraisal and negotiations were conducted with a
sense of urgency in a very fragile environment with a government still establishing itself.
Considering these uncertainties, during 2010 and the first three quarters of 2011,
especially in the south, the government’s performance in addressing both short- and long-
term issues was clearly satisfactory.

6.     Lessons Learned

57.     The Bank needs to engage more actively, albeit indirectly, in the Kyrgyz
reform process, especially in cross-cutting policy areas requiring inter-sectoral
coordination. The government remains fragmented and poorly coordinated, which
hinders its ability to take coherent decisions efficiently. The reform process tends to
proceed sporadically, reflecting the time and effort often needed to develop and achieve
consensus on the way forward. This is particularly the case in cross-cutting and sensitive
areas such as governance and transparency where vested interests remain strong. In these
circumstances, key reforms need to be secured at the highest political level early in the
preparation process and, to ensure implementation and sustainability, they may also need
to be re-affirmed periodically at the same high level. Consultations with other
stakeholders, such as members of parliament and civil society representatives are also
essential. Finally, for preparation and implementation of multi-sectoral operations such as
the ERSO, the government may need to establish a more formal coordination mechanism
or structure.

58.      A single-tranche operation can be an adequate response to an emergency or
crisis, but its effectiveness and impact may ultimately be a function of the prospect
for follow-up operations. Initially designed as a single-tranche operation, and
supporting reforms undertaken or underway since the mid-2010 crisis, the ERSO
balanced short-term needs and medium-term concerns. This approach and the prospect of
a series of multi-year programmatic development policy operations, if the authorities
stayed the course, arguably enhanced its potential longer-term impact and, in turn,
facilitated the preparation of the planed FY13 DPO series.

59.     A well-designed development policy operation can send a powerful signal to
the international community about the commitment, if not the capacity of the
authorities, to mitigate the impact of a crisis. While the Bank’s leadership of the post-
crisis response during 2010, including the multi-development conference and its FY11
Emergency Recovery Project and additional financing, preceded preparation of the
ERSO, the Bank’s plans to resume budget support were well known and doubtless
encouraged others, such as the ADB and the EU, to follow. Anti-corruption and
governance will continue to frame the Bank’s country strategy, and its continued

                                            21
emphasis on these issues not only reinforces government commitment but also
contributes to stability. However, there remains a very substantial agenda and,
notwithstanding understandable concerns about the need for visible results, patience and
a long-term view and commitment are necessary.

60.      Both political will and the government’s ability to finance reforms in the
medium term are essential for sustainability. A number of medium term outcomes are
currently contingent on the availability of external finance, e.g. funding for the KEITI
secretariat; support for financial sector reforms and improved capacity in the central
bank; and financing from the Bank and the ADB in the energy sector. Responsibility for
the sustainability of these reforms rests with the government and its willingness and
ability to finance them over the medium-term.

•    Comments on privatization and state property management
     −   Paragraph 36 should be updated to read as follows: "In mid-2010, the Interim
          Government reversed privatization of two electricity distribution companies and
          the country’s largest telecommunications company undertaken at end-2009 and
          early-2010 under the previous Government of the Kyrgyz Republic. These
          transactions had been conducted improperly, including undervaluation of assets.
          The Government of the Kyrgyz Republic has made a number of decisions that
          allow taking back into state ownership property that was previously illegally
          privatized, as well as adjust and strengthen asset management standards and
          practices applied by the Ministry of State Property (former State Property
          Management Committee), thereby ensuring transparency and openness of the
          privatization process. In January 2012, the Ministry of State Property was
          reorganized into the State Property Management Fund under the Government of
          the Kyrgyz Republic responsible for practical implementation of the medium-
          term privatization program approved by the Parliament. The policy-making
          functions in this area have been vested into the Ministry of Economy of the
          Kyrgyz Republic. The Ministry came up with a privatization program for 2012-
          2014, which was adopted by the Parliament in April 2012.?
     − Additional information on privatization should be included in paragraph 49: "The
       privatization process is implemented on the basis of a medium-term program of
       privatization of state property (normally approved for three years). Until very
       recently, the medium-term privatization program as the main regulatory
       document that defined the list of state property assets to be privatized was
       approved by the Government. In June 2011, the sector legislation was amended
       (Law of the Kyrgyz Republic on amendments to the Law on privatization of state
       property in the Kyrgyz Republic, KR Law No.54 dated June 23, 2011) in a way
       that set a requirement for the privatization program to be approved by the
       Parliament. This mechanism provides for control, efficiency and accountability
       in the process of privatization of state property.
